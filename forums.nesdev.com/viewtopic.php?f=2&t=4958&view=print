		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />yeah i know the game isn't the most complicated, but it took me a little more than a month to do and is my first completed project for the NES.
<br />
<br />I am actually getting collage credit for this (as an independent project), so that is why there is the MLA format in the corner.
<br />
<br />There are 24 words available, and you get the credit screen after level 6, so there is replayability, and I wrote all the music myself in famitracker.
<br />
<br />so let me know what you think...

<br />
<br />before anyone complains, i know the screen is quit plain. I figured my main focus should be the code, and not the art (which i suck at.)

<br />
<br />I think it has pretty good presentation. It's addictive, certainly, because of the "I was so close" factor. Though I'm pretty bad at it. I like the music, too. Overall, nice work!

It took me forever just to get to the sixth level, and then it was a word I hadn't seen yet I guess, because I lost haha I'm sure you're really excited right now. I remember when I finished my first NES project. It was like a huge sigh of relief that I actually got through it hehe
<br />
<br />Good job : )

<br />
<br />One thing I would recommend though is showing the player which letters they've chosen, and also making it impossible to choose the same letter more than once

<br />
<br />Thank you i will do that immediately!!!
<br />
<br />I will just replace the file in the link.
<br />
<br />EDIT: The linked file has been updated to remove the placeholder gfx, as mentioned by Banshaku. Thanks again...

The only negative thing which I can spot is, that you can select the same letter once again and again <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I gave the game a plug at PDR so I hope a few more NES enthusiats will enjoy your prog.

<br />D'oh! I didn't even notice that one was misspelled hehe It certainly helped me that I was hitting mainly the vowels first, though.

<br />
<br />Thanks. I actually grabbed most of these words off of a random word generator. That was one that slipped under the radar.
<br />
<br />I am rebuilding it and replacing the old file. It should also (probably) work on real hardware too after this.
<br />
<br />EDIT: The File in the link has been updated (fixed the misspelled word too:)  .) I will add list of failed letters and stop the player from failing the same letter twice soon...

<br />
<br />I just checked SOWPODS, a list of words drawn from various dictionaries and used for playing Scrabble.
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">grep -i -E &quot;ge?ment&quot; E:\language\scrabble\sowpods.txt</div>
<br />Where the 'g' sounds like 'dj', the ending -gement seems to be the rule, with a few exceptions:
<br /><ul><li>Words ending in -dgement can also end in -dgment (abridgment, judgment, lodgment). In fact, the American English spell check in my copy of Firefox likes only the -gment. </li><li>ACKNOWLEDGMENT has no -gement variation at all. </li></ul><br />Things that annoyed me:<br /><ul><li>Left and right on the Control Pad didn't autorepeat. </li><li>Letters are in one row, not in three rows like on a BlackBerry. The up and down arrows on the Control Pad are there for a reason <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> </li><li>The first time I played, the "level 1" word had very few of RSTLNE. Ending the player's first game so quickly might give a bad impression. </li><li>Does not show the correct word after failure. </li><li>Does not erase letters that have been used. </li></ul>And some other suggestions: <ul><li>Every time a consonant is revealed, add a credit. Choosing a vowel takes away a credit. For example, if I choose T, and there are two T's, I get two credits and can spend them on, say, revealing E's and A's. </li><li>When the player gets a letter right, have a woman walk across the screen and have the letters change behind her. </li></ul>
