I'm using MMC3 for the scanline IRQs, and thus can't turn off sprites with $2001. I'm also using CHR-RAM, so I can't bank in blank data on those lines (or can I --- does MMC3 have chr-ram banking functionality?).<br /><br />My best idea currently is to use the SMB3 trick that hides power up sprites using low-index back-priority sprites. However, implementing this would require tracking the positions of all my sprite objects so I could place the hiding sprites. I'm hoping there's a better way which wouldn't require so much time spent tracking objects.<br /><br />Any ideas?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The fact that you're using MMC3 IRQs for other things doesn't prevent you from using them for this as well. You just have to check what comes first, the other split or the text box, so that you can setup the IRQs in the correct order.<br /><br />But if you really don't want to use IRQs, you can use the good old sprite 0 hit. As long as the top scanline of the text box has solid pixels, a sprite 0 hit can tell you when it starts, at which point you can disable sprite rendering and count cycles until it's time to enable them again. I'm assuming that wasting time on wait loops isn't an issue, since I doubt there will be much action going on while text is being displayed (most games I can think of are practically paused during that time).<br /><br />The only disadvantage I see is that sprites could still be visible at the top left of the text box before you disable them, but you can solve that by using 7 high priority sprites in addition to sprite 0 to mask out whatever would be visible otherwise.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ninja Gaiden III at certain points just disables sprites at a particular line to make them appear as though they go behind the background. Ninja Gaiden III also uses the IRQs for the status bar at the top of the screen as well. So you can certainly use IRQs to do what you need. <br /><br />Given that you have just a box area you want no sprites in I think disabling sprites is the way to go. No need to use other sprites to mask things.

Existing MMC3 boards with CHR RAM (TGROM, TQROM, TNROM) connect A10-A12 of the CHR RAM to the CHR A10-A12 outputs of the MMC3. Given that 128 tiles for all 64 sprites can fit in $1000-$17FF, it's feasible in some cases to leave $1C00-$1FFF of CHR RAM completely unused. Here's one possible way to arrange VRAM:<br /><ul><li>$0000-$0FFF: Background tiles </li><li>$1000-$17FF: Tiles for sprites 0-63 </li><li>$1800-$1BFF: Alphabet tiles, or VWF plane if you're rendering text that way </li><li>$1C00-$1FFF: Blank </li></ul><br />Homebrew boards or rewired donor boards that use a 62256 (32 KiB) instead of a 6264 (8 KiB) would additionally connect A13-A14 to the MMC3's CHR bank outputs. You can emulate such boards in any emulator that supports NES 2.0 headers by setting the &quot;CHR RAM size&quot; field to 32 KiB.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think if you disable only sprites by $2001 it won't affect the scanline counter, because the PPU still fetches them. I might be wrong though.<br /><br />Other ways to do it :<br />- Use blank CHR-ROM page<br />- Abuse 8-sprites per line limitation<br />- Just do it by software if it's acceptable to get only 8 pixel of accuracty (that's what I do in my game).<br /><br />Also you don't need as much sprites as you're telling if you want to abuse 8-sprites per line limitation. Just use 8 sprites for the top line and 8 for the bottom line, and mask the sprites in between by software (i.e. just don't put them in OAM). This eats up 1/4 of OAM, sure, so in the worst case where all 64 are used and only one will have to be clipped, this won't be the best solution.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There is no need for a test ROM. We can just look at Ninja Gaiden III again. Stage 2, IRQs are continued to be used after disabling sprites. Sprites are disabled on line 175. This hides sprites like they sink into the ground. However after this is done, another IRQ fires at line 206, to parallax scroll the very bottom portion of the screen. So the IRQ counter most definitely works with the sprites disabled.
