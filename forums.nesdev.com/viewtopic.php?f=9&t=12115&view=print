		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That was one of the things I checked. Corrupting the save data with various bytes will crash the game when you try to load it. But it doesn't stop the game's menu coming up which has the option to erase/initialize save data. He said the game just black screens from the start.<br /><br />I don't think the ROM expansion is an issue either. The hack behaves fine in Nestopia and other emulators so I'm not sure what might be the cause. It would be nice to find out. I also checked if any program bank registers were uninitialized but it appears they are initialized before non-fixed banks are accessed. <br /><br />I didn't look into anything else yet.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><s>I&#39;m noticing weird stuff w.r.t. the PPU address during startup. There is a fill loop at $FDE1 writing to $2007, and it is fine for the first few lines but &#40;at least in FCEUX&#41; the PPU address starts going haywire eventually and it&#39;s basically making writes to essentially random locations? That&#39;s a bit odd. Strangely, I am not picking up any writes to $2000 or $2001 to interfere with it, not really sure how this is occurring.</s><br /><br />Edit: Nevermind, this is probably a bug in FCEUX's debugger. Doesn't occur with Old PPU mode selected, and can't duplicate behaviour in Nintendulator.<br /><br /><br />On the PowerPak I do at least see some coloured lines on the screen for one frame, indicating it manages to write the palette before it hangs on a black screen. (I see identical coloured lines in Nintendulator 5 frames after reset. On frame 6 the title screen should appear, but on the PowerPak it is just black.) I suppose this is also the first frame the MMC3 IRQ is first needed for the scroll split at the bottom of the screen, but I don't think it quite gets that far, since the curtains are never visible.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yep. Mario In Some Usual Day, like Mario Adventure, isn't clearing any of it's WRAM. I didn't really find any significant space to put a proper clearing routine back in, but I did have enough bytes to have the reset code write 0x00 to the problem byte (CPU 0x7955 - WRAM 0x1955). If it's anything but 0x00 the game will essentialy freeze (music still appears to play though).

You will need to know the pinout of that chip though.
