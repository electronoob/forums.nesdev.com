		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Let's say I want to arbitrarily change tiles on the background. Intuition says that the way I would do that is to simply set the value of PPUADDR to the location I want, and then write the tile's nametable entry. Easy enough, right? So here's my attempt at a proof of concept, where I set the starting point of where to draw, and then draw the next 256 tiles.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; LDA PPUSTATUS<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LDA #$20<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; STA PPUADDR<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LDA #$30<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; STA PPUADDR<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LDA #1<br />doloopy:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; STA PPUDATA<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; INX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; BNE doloopy<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ; omitting warmup code.<br /></div><br /><br />But it doesn't work the way I would expect it to. Instead of starting in the middle of the first row of tiles, I get a weird blank space on the right of the screen, as if the background was scrolled. After puzzling over it for a while, I tried on a whim zeroing out the PPUADDR, and (wouldn't you know it) that worked! Hurrah!<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; LDA PPUSTATUS<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LDA #$20<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; STA PPUADDR<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LDA #$30<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; STA PPUADDR<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LDA #1<br />doloopy:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; STA PPUDATA<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; INX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; BNE doloopy<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ; NEW CODE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LDA PPUSTATUS<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LDA #0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; STA PPUADDR<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; STA PPUADDR<br /></div><br /><br />However, based on what I've read, <em>I shouldn't need to do this</em>. Why does this behave the way it does? Is something else using PPUADDR? Where is this documented?<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

The address register we access through $2006 is the same one the PPU uses to read data in order to draw the image. So if you leave that register pointing to same tile in the name tables, that's the point where rendering will start in the following frame. It is mandadory that you reset the scroll every frame at the end of your VBlank handler, so that rendering starts at the position you want to, not the last place you accessed with $2006/$2007.<br /><br />However, writing 0's to $2006 is NOT the proper way of resetting the scroll (that doesn't reset all the bits). You're supposed to use $2000 (to select the upper scrolling bits i.e. the name table) and $2005 (X and Y scroll).

I did some digging in the information related to scrolling and I wasn't aware that the same memory location was used for scrolling as well - it's a bit unintuitive at first blush.<br /><br />I think I get it now... or at least, I get it enough to muddle through it on my own for a while. I appreciate the help clearing up my misconceptions! :)

The 6502 happens to communicate with other chips by mapping their registers to specific memory locations (since it lacks input/output ports), but the actual thing being reused here is an address register.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">it's a bit unintuitive at first blush.</div><br />It is, from a programmer's point of view. But if you keep in mind that these chips are designed to be as simple (and, consequently, cheap) as possible, it makes sense for the PPU to have only one register to access memory, regardless of WHO is making the access, the game program or the PPU itself for rendering purposes.<br /><br />If something looks weird to you, the game programmer, and a lot of things probably will (like registers being read/written bit by bit, values you have to write somewhere before some other task can be done, things you have to sacrifice in order to make use of some feature, etc.), there most likely is a hardware design reason behind it.

The actual information it tries to convey is not complicated at all... it just shows which bits get written where when you write to the PPU registers (and the bit that gets cleared!), and if you know what each bit means, you can figure out the ideal order to write to these registers and correctly set ALL scroll bits to the values you want.
