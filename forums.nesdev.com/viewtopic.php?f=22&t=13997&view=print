		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've started on a thousand projects both on the NES and in C++ for the PC, but nothing got anywhere and I think it's because I'd never share anything when I worked on it, so I didn't have any kind of proof of progress, leading to no motivation.<br /><br />This is probably going to be another project that I start and never finish, but this time, I'm making a thread on the off-chance that constantly posting about progress, no matter how minor, might help.<br /><br />My new project is a 1P and 2P co-op arcade-style game called Clean-Up Crew. Sorry for another static-screen homebrew project, but not every game can be a multi-directional scrolling platformer. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />You're given a building, and in the building is a bunch of stuff that needs to be cleaned up. For example, trash on the floor that you need to sweep up, garbage cans that spit out enemies (which you need to whack with your broom and then close the trash can with a lid). Some buildings can have different tasks, for example, windows that need wiping, floors that need mopping, some kind of gimmick that needs to be satisfied, some kind of gimmick way to clean up, etc.<br /><br />The tone of the game is just hijinks, you're two doofus guys who are hired when there's literally no alternative, the game won't take itself seriously, you can hit each other with your tools (accidentally or on purpose), and there's no overarching storyline or anything, it's just hey here's a 2P game we can play alright cool.<br /><br />Order of business #1 is some art I drew to visualize this idea, which is attached. Anything in this thread is fair game for constructive criticism, as well as feedback. I'm sometimes arrogant, but even if I think I know everything, I still want to improve at what I do.<br /><br />I also finished walking animations for the character, I'll post those when I'm done poking at them. Pixel art, especially animations, is a lot of poking until stuff looks right.<br /><br />Some names for the two player characters would be nice... I got this game idea while I was bored at work, and the original names I came up with were &quot;Pipi&quot; and &quot;Pupu&quot;. Pipi &amp; Pupu's Clean-Up Crew. Although I got a kick out of that, some different names would probably be better. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

And walking automatically pushes whatever trash is on the floor. One player could grab the dustpan, or just leave it in the corner and sweep the trash over to it. Characters slide over puddles of water. Mopping water over the stairs creates a falling hazard. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />This is probably complicating things, but have you considered adding a recycling component to this? For example, aluminum cans on the ground: you can throw them in the trash without penalty, but tossing them in the recycling bin awards bonus points.<br /><br />I'd really like to see this project take off.

I was thinking of having all the supplies be in one or more broom closets placed throughout the stages.<br /><br />The slippery water and the recycling are nice ideas, I'll hang onto them.

	</div><br />Guess what one of your objectives might be!<br /><br />I think I settled on the player names too, Bruce for the blue guy, and Roy for the red guy. I've also been planning the control scheme; it'd be nice if this could run on a Famicom, but controller 2 doesn't have start and select buttons. This is important because this is a 1P or 2P game, where a second player can jump in whenever, and one of the players can gameover out, just like an arcade game. In 1P mode, the player can hold two items, and you toggle between them. In 2P mode, each player gets one item. 2P -&gt; 1P mode, the leaving player's item goes to the remaining player, and in 1P -&gt; 2P mode, the player's inactive item goes to the joining player.<br /><br />The problem is that the select button was going to be how you toggle between your items in 1P mode, and that's not suitable for the second famicom controller.<br /><br />The current draft for controls is that the A button is your &quot;item&quot; button, and the B button is a context-sensitive button for grabbing and pushing things, and other non-dpad interactions with the environment. When you're not standing in front of something that reacts to the B button, the B button will toggle between your items instead. This might end up feeling better than pressing the select button anyway.<br /><br />In addition, the start button was going to be how you join, but the game can check for both start and A. The game can still check both controllers for a start button press in order to pause. I'm not as worried about P2 not being able to pause without using an expansion port controller.<br /><br />Speaking of which, a common complaint I've heard is when games don't check for expansion port controllers on the Famicom. That's a simple OR between bits 0 and 1 when you read from either controller port, right? Total Famicom support is probably not that important, but the bonus points would be nice still. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

On the famicom, you could make only 1st player able to pause the game and for select on the second controller, you blow into the microphone. Toggling items isn't exactly the most urgent thing ever, so it might work. I'm not sure how sensitive the mic is though.
