<br />It's true. We get the chance to try things that wouldn't be possible in any high level language, it's total freedom. Also, nothing beats being able to tell the computer *exactly* what to do.

(No, it wasn't to write <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dian_Shi_Mali" class="postlink">PUSH START TO RICH</a>.) For tasks where being able to express complicated logic is more important than user response time, a compiler doesn't have to be 100 percent efficient. That's why so many business rely on Python and/or VB, and why web applications are JavaScript instead of downloadable native clients.

And I agree with the whole absolute control thing. When coding in C, you just tell it to multiply two non-integer numbers willy-nilly and you don't realize that you're probably doing something that takes a dozen or more scanlines. And without ASM, things like doynax's polygon engine, or tokumaru's raycaster would not be possible.

<br />
<br />Seriously, from what I've seen it's mostly a text game with a few pictures and animations here and there, doesn't seem hard to make with BASIC.
<br />
<br />What I'd like to see is a scrolling platformer coded in BASIC for a 6502 machine that isn't painfully slow...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hmm... Perhaps then Bugs Bunny's Birthday Blowout was coded in C or BASIC then, haha (seriously, WTF is the frame rate in that game all about?).
<br />
<br />Oh, good old Oregon Trail. I don't think I played the first one ever; when I was in elementary school we actually had Oregon Trail 2. But judging from what I see in the video, I'll have to side with tokumaru on this. A text adventure like Oregon Trail would be pretty easy to make in BASIC, and even if the thing runs at 20 FPS, you don't notice because there's nothing really going on visually.
<br />
<br />Also, I'm sure linking together routines written in ASM with a language like BASIC is a lot less inefficient than coding the whole thing in BASIC. So it doesn't seem like Oregon Trail proves much about coding games for old consoles in BASIC/C. I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm just saying that I have yet to see proof (I'm sure there is proof, somewhere) that coding in C for the NES (or older consoles) is a good idea.

There are plenty of genres and game designs for which "there's nothing really going on visually". RPGs might be another one. My current project might be one were it not for the fact that I'm writing it in asm so that I don't have to write an interpreter or a compiler.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Celius wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Also, I'm sure linking together routines written in ASM with a language like BASIC is a lot less inefficient than coding the whole thing in BASIC.</div>
<br />Apart from copy deterrence, the only reason I can see that the game uses asm at all is because Apple forgot to put a proper blitter in Applesoft BASIC's "HGR" library.
