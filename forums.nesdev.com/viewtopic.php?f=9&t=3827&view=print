		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is anyone else having occasional problems with MMC3 games? I've noticed the following problems:
<br />
<br />- flickering lines not present on real cart: Pinball Quest title screen, several others
<br />- occasional crashes: SMB3's status bar bounces a lot, then eventually becomes garbled and the game freezes; occurs about half the time I load the game
<br />- flickering sprites: just MC Kids so far (turns rendering off early to gain extra Vblank cycles; interfering with sprite processing perhaps?)
<br />- All but one MMC3 IRQ test ROM fails: MMC3 IRQ Clocking Scanline Timing Test by Shay Green (17 Oct 2005) (PD).nes
<br />
<br />I have both the latest boot ROM and mapper pack installed, as well as the resistor fix, though it had the same problems before the fix. Using different consoles sometimes yields different results (SMB3 never crashes on an AV Famicom, very often on a first-revision NES). Most other games that do work often show more/different scanline glitches compared to their official cartridge counterparts, which behave the same regardless of which console I test them on.
<br />
<br />Any ideas?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hmm...you're right. 1.00 seems to fix every problem I mentioned <strong>except</strong> M.C. Kids (which is arguably worse), and passes all the tests. The only real drawback is that it doesn't have the soft-reset functionality of 1.20.
<br />
<br />How difficult would it be to add that particular function to the old mapper file? Has mapper development come to a grinding halt? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As I understand, bunnyboy used Kevin Horton's MMC3 schematic in the newer PowerPak mapper files (as used in his FPGA NES).  Although kev's implementation is supposed to be hardware accurate, it was done in different software from what bunnyboy is using, so it was conjectured that perhaps the conversion between the two programs caused something to mess up.
<br />
<br />Frankly, I'm surprised bunnyboy hasn't gone back to his original implementation by now, since it clearly worked better (though it had issues of its own, they weren't as severe).  I'm also surprised he didn't verify the newer implementation using Blargg's tests before releasing it.

<br />
<br />Regardless, I still think it's responsible for the flickering sprites, since the flickering stops when you pass a level or go back to the map screen, and the older mapper file makes it worse. I just verified that the prototype (which <em>doesn't</em> turn off rendering early) does not suffer from this problem.
<br />
<br />Another odd thing about the older mapper file is that it tends to produce random solid blocks scattered throughout the levels, and the music sometimes goes out of sync. Both the level layout and some music data are stored in WRAM, so perhaps it's getting corrupted somehow?
