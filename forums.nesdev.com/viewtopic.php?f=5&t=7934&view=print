<br />Tokumaru says you can update 4~8 tiles per frame.
<br />Isn't Dreamworld Pogie updating..12 tiles per frame? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> 
<br />And these tiles are in different PPU adresses, so it'll take (a little) longer to update it.
<br />Any thoughs on that?

<br />It greatly depends on the technique used, and also on what other tasks are performed in the same VBlank. With the fastest code possible (unrolled chain of LDAs + STAs) you can update a little over 16 tiles if you aren't doing anything else in the same VBlank.
<br />
<br />However, if you need to perform a sprite DMA, update the palette and a handful of name and attribute table bytes, you'll realistically update a maximum of 8 tiles. You can of course disable rendering and extend the blanking time a bit, which will allow you to update more.
<br />
<br />In my game, I have 3 "update slots" in VBlank. If all 3 slots are used for updating patterns, 24 tiles are updated. Of course this hardly happens when the screen is moving at fast speeds, so most of the time only 1 or 2 slots will be used for patterns.

This is how this game gets away with updating all those tiles even with a fairly slow loop.

<br />Oh, that's how it works!
<br />Thanks for pointing it out.
<br />This may be a useful trick if I need more Vblank Time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When you need more VBlank time than what's available, you have 2 options: start it earlier (which this game does) or end it late. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages:
<br />
<br /><strong>Disable rendering earlier:</strong> requires mapper IRQs or sprite 0 hits. Sprite hits are hard to guarantee when you have vertical scrolling as well, and you must be absolute sure that the game logic will finish before the sprite hit, otherwise you'll miss it and there will be side effects (that range from the bottom of the screen blinking - if you have prepared for this problem - to corrupt VRAM writes and bad scrolling - if you are less careful). There's also a recently discovered hardware quirk that causes sprites to glitch in the next frame if you are not really careful about when and how the rendering is disabled.
<br />
<br /><strong>Enabling rendering late:</strong> The VBlank handling starts with an NMI, as usual, but rendering is kept disabled after the start of the frame. Requires timed code or mapper IRQs that work when rendering is off, so that rendering is always enabled at the same point. Writing constant-timed Vblank code can be tough (but not impossible by any means), but there are techniques that allow you to detect the end of VBlank, in which case only the code past that point would need to be constant-timed (updating the pattern tables for example is a good thing to do here).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm loving the debug functions in this game. A+B = Free movement. 
<br />
<br />Also, I don't think it's updating 12 tiles per frame. Looks more like fourish tiles most frames. Maybe one or two more that I'm not seeing. This makes the animations of the tiles not even match up. Like the stars. The bottom isn't synced to the top, which is distracting to me. I even noticed it before I played frame by frame.
<br />
<br />Stars:
<br />Top left tile changes on frame 1
<br />Top right tile change on frame 2
<br />Bottom left tile changes on frame 3
<br />Bottom right tile changes on frame 4.
<br />Doesn't change on frames 5-8
<br />
<br />Peppermint Swirl:
<br />Doesn't change on frames 1-4
<br />Top left tile changes on frame 5
<br />Top right changes on frame 6
<br />Bottom left changes on frame 7
<br />Bottom right changes on frame 8
<br />
<br />Pepperment Poles:
<br />Update every frame.
<br />
<br />Gears:
<br />Work identical to stars
<br />
<br />Sand Dunes:
<br />Only have two tiles, but update with the Pepperment swirls.
<br />
<br />
<br />So just four tiles in a frame, that I can see.
<br />
<br />Edit: Actually, the thing that impresses me is that this game swaps sprite background priority for the main character fairly often. It's simple to do, but I can't recall another game that does it quite like this. You walk behind palm trees, but in front of green blocks and candy canes. SMB3 and other games I can think of do it in really specific cases, this game goes crazy with it.

<br />Could it be because a lot of games don't have a solid-color-0 background and would need to use a SMB3-style mask sprite at the boundary?

<br />"Yolkfolk Forest" and "Mines" from Fantastic Adventures Of Dizzy also play tricks like that.

<br />One more disadvantage: the dot-crawl pattern changes, because one PPU clock isn't skipped on the pre-render scanline. How big of a deal this really is is of course up for debate. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Unfortunately there's no source code at that address, it's just the 8 16KB PRG-ROM banks of the game in separate files. Calling it "source code" is very very misleading. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />The person who first called that "source code" probably doesn't even know what source code is.
