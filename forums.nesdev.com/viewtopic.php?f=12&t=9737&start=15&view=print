If you haven't drawn one it's a pretty vital tool to you for figuring out what's going on.  It will also help us see exactly what you're doing and gives us a better chance to point you in the right direction. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I do have a schematic that I've drawn out on paper, and as soon as I get a chance I will redraw that on the computer so I can upload it here.<br /><br />@lidnariq I don't know how the '139 handles Sram, but I did do a copy from how the FF5 cart has it wired, the only thing being different is the BA6162 versus the D2145 3 prong-thingy they have in theirs.<br /><br />@Mark its the same type of 64k ram found in any SNES cart (in fact, it has been pulled from a known-good cart).<br /><br />@Mottzilla I havent tried holding reset during power off. I figure if I need to hold down reset for this cart to ensure the save works then I need to find a better option...no one likes having to do that <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

That being said, I would like to just focus on what might cause this to happen, and a possible fix, before I move on to another game. Because if this method doesn't work for this particular game, then it will most likely happen on others as well, which renders it useless.

Is it a custom board using a different chip decoder or a donor cart with a MAD-1? <br /><br />I have made this game before using a standard 1J3M board and MAD-1 chip and the game worked without a problem. The only thing that has changed here is the '139 and the BA6162 instead of the MAD-1.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So your circuit is kinda gunked up...  You've got multiple chips trying to drive (output) to a single line (wire), pretty big 'No-No' for logic design.  When those two chips disagree on what the output value should be they'll output as much current as the can trying to put their voltage on the wire.  Who knows that the chip that uses that signal as an input actually sees.  I'd say it's not surprising that you're loosing saves in the manner that you're seeing based on your circuit.<br /><br />First question:  What are the signals you're connecting to the 'cart conn'?  I can only guess which signal you're using there.<br /><br />Conflicts you have that must be resolved:<br />1) '139 pin11 and ba6162 pin5 are both trying to drive the green SRAM CE.<br /><br />2) ba6162 pin2 and cart conn (I assume) are both tring to drive the pink line.  <br /><br />What pin is the pink line connected to on the SRAM?  SRAM doesn't generally have a reset pin, I'm guessing this is CE or something.  I'm also uncertain on what pin your connecting to on the far right of the SRAM.  Sounds like you're connecting SRAM /OE to Flash /CE?  and that's being controlled by cart conn /ROMSEL?<br /><br />It's still a little cloudy on what's actually going on here, but if I make a lot of assumptions I'd guess you might want to try something like this:<br /><br />Disconnect the pink line from the cart connector.  Disconnect the green line from the ba6162.  This should let the '139 decode when the SRAM is being accessed by the CPU, and let the 6162 control when to disable the SRAM because Vcc &lt; Vbattery to maintain saves during power down.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I will redraw the schematic as soon as I get a chance and show each line, to the cart connector. My other one is pretty crude, and clearly isnt stating enough info.<br /><br />The pink line connects the Ba6162 /RESET pin to pin 26 on the SRAM (/RESET) to cart connector 26.<br /><br />The '139 needs to be connected to SRAM /CE or the game doesnt work. and If the BA6162 isnt connected to Sram /ce the saves are deleted every reset. So i'm not sure how else to wire that...which is why they are connected together.<br /><br />I will draw a better one, and hopefully that helps out a little better with what is going on in the cart.

Its still pretty low budget, but I don't really do drawing schematics on the computer very well.<br /><br />*old, removed*<br /><br /><br />Let me know if this helps a little better.<br /><br />From what I see on a regular cart, Sram /CE2 connects to the /RESET pin of the MAD-1, which is connected to the SNES connector /RESET. If you check out the data sheet for the BA6162 (linked a couple posts up) it shows it has a /RESET pin and 2 /CS pins...so its a little confusing as to if I should have that attached to /CS on that chip or to the /RESET pin...
