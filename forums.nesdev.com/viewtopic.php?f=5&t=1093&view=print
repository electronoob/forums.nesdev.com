<br />I'm pretty proud myslef to be able to reach the snake level without cheating. But the snake level itself is too much for me right now. Maybe with a lot of traiging.... ?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I should put a disclaimer that I can't really remember if I ever did this without using the "mild cheat" of starting with 5 lives by pressing down + A + B when starting the game, but I remember having completed the game without using warps back in the days. It's not all that hard if you devote the time needed.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, getting through this game with two players seems next to impossible, since the game is A LOT harder with two players, even when both are fairly skilled and patient. Me and my girlfriend just completed it the last weekend, after several weekends devoted to it, half of which had us stuck at the Dark Queen's tower, and this was WITH a game genie "infinite lives"-cheat. 
<br />
<br />Additionally, we "sort-of" cheated through one of the middle passages at the dark queens tower by exploiting one of the game's many "pickup-bugs": let one player pick up the other, and make the red rhino eat up the picked-up player. The picked-up player will die, but the sprite remain attached at the head of the living player, who can then play on until he/she bites the dust as well. 
<br />
<br />Though we only did this trick at one passage which just seemed infinetely impossible to pull off with two players, since the trampoline platforms malfunctioned 9 times out of 10, not letting you get high enough, when two players were bouncing on top of them. I personally feel that the game was rushed to the ROM factory and wasn't throughly balanced in two-player mode when stamped for release. 
<br />
<br />We used a similar trick more extensively at level 8, where it lets both toads become immune to electicity. 
<br />
<br />These kind of bug exploits do present kind of an ethical gaming dilemma: when and when not is exploiting game bugs equal to cheating? Kind of a gray area, since many smaller bugs in NES games are just considered common knowledge of that game's functionality. :)

<br />This isn't cheating, unless it comes to have a really big impact (like someone pressing B 64 times on Rad Racer demo screen then press start to have the ending couldn't say he beat the game).
<br />There is several glitches in Battletoads, but it is nothing compared to Castlevania II - Simon's Quest.
<br />I didn't try 2 players mode, I actually not own the real card unfortunately and play with 2 player on an emulator is pure hell. Playing alone is sill fun.

<br />I'll just let you know that I consider the snake pit to be one of the easier levels in the game. Just wait 'til you get past that one and onto Volkmire's Inferno, where you'll be up against some REAL action... :)
<br />
<br />The most insane level of them all IMHO opinion is the clinger-winger... and a living hell in two player mode, since the screen will scroll according to the leading toad's position, making it several times harder for the other toad to time his movement perfectly. (which you have to, since there are NO new start points that will forgive your mistakes) Me and my girlfriend spent 5-6 hours on that level in two-player mode before completing it.

<br />The snake level sure isn't hard, but there is always sprikes where you didn't except to, or when you think you were able to evade spikes you actually aren't.
<br />
<br />I cannot even pass the first section of volkmire inferno without cheats. The last time I did it, I was framestepping the WHOLE race ! The same goes for the rat race section 3, where framestepping is absolutely NEEDED to beat the level.
<br />The clinger winger is sure terrific, but I think the last level and the volkmire are both worse.

<br />
<br />Speaking of it... the rat race is one of the VERY FEW places where the game is actually easier in two-player mode, since a player will just fall through the floors when he/she can't keep up the pace with the other.
<br />
<br />I highly recommend getting a real Battletoads cart... playing it in an emulator with slow-motion cheats doesn't do justice to history's greatest game ever. :)

<br />I'd like it too, but I cannot find any for now. If I see any, I'll get it for sure.
<br />The game is sure one of the more fun and addictive action games I've played, but sometimes when you loose again and again it can become very anoying... But that won't stom you to retry several days laters, hehe.

The last time I played this game I was attempting to go through it with no warps, but whenever I got through the inferno, I just didn't have enough lives for the rest of the game <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />  I'll have to give it another shot sometime soon.
<br />
<br />As for scoring, you can actually max your score out on the level where you fight Robo-Manus.  When you see one of the areas that shoot out those balls, you can stand there and have a turbo button held down for a long time ... 999,999 if I remember correctly.

<br />Of all the areas I love the speed levels with obstacles to avoid. There's so much subtlety in the design of them. They'll set up apparent patterns to get you thinking in a constrained manner, then break the pattern in some unexpected way so you'll crash.

<br />The revolution is the last stage, right ? You got it without cheat ?? Is that even possible ?
<br />And you say the Wookie hole is the hardest level ??? It is pretty easy.
