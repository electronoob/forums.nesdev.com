Typically the volume envelope is the longest, so if your duty cycle is a fairly standard one that is used for a crisp sounding attack or what not and you have a longer volume envelope, the duty cycle will loop as expected.<br /><br />Perhaps I should use the pattern length in rows instead to determine the length of sound effects---that way you can control it more precisely. Thoughts?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello!<br /><br />I made something that I thought might be useful to others.<br /><br />It's pretty simple, just a slight modification to the GGsound demo. It's in ASM6 format but I can make a CA65 one if it someone requests it.<br /><br />The purpose of this is to help a composer, without programming knowledge, to demo their songs on an NES console or emulator. I wanted it so that a composer could export their FTM song, convert to ASM, rename the output files to &quot;track_data.inc&quot; and &quot;track_dpcm.inc&quot; and drop them into the demo file, build, and listen. I wanted to make sure that the track list would stop at the beginning and end no matter how many songs were included, I also wanted the same for SFX, and for a sound designer to be able to select the various sound effects.<br /><br />All of the changes that I made are included in one file, demo.asm. This file can be dropped into the &quot;ggsound_asm6&quot; folder to apply these changes to the demo. Opcodes that I added are capitalized. There is an additional variable declaration for current_sfx, and an initialization of that variable. There are constants called SONG_INDEX_END and SFX_INDEX_END which are calculated at assembly. A song will no longer restart when you hit the end of the track list, which is just personal preference and it was a little easier to set up that way.<br /><br />I hope this helps somebody!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm getting an error when converting a song but I guess this has to do with the fact that I don't have cc65 properly installed. I managed to run the build demo python script when I copied ca65.exe and ld65.exe do the same folder as the py script, but converting a song isn't working when I use that dirty fix. Even copying all cc65 exes to the folder doesn't cut it. So, when searching for instructions on how to install cc65 I run into a problem. <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Installing_CC65" class="postlink">This page</a> says:<br />&quot;Extract cc65-win32-#####.zip to a new folder.<br />Open this folder and run the install.vbs file as an administrator to copy it to Program Files.&quot;<br /><br />Now, the original cc65 website doesn't have anything anymore, and it says:<br />&quot;Oliver Schmidt, long time contributor to the libraries is providing support for the old version. See <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://cc65.github.io/cc65/">http://cc65.github.io/cc65/</a><!-- m --> for more information.&quot;<br />So I go to that new site and the package is presented in a new portable format only. I can't install it, it seems.<br /><br />I tried unzipping the package to c:\cc65 as I recall someone suggesting that, but still doesn't work.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">D:\programas\_nes modding\assembly\_cc65\ggsound-master\ggsound_ca65&gt;ft_txt_to_a<br />sm.py tension.txt<br />Traceback (most recent call last):<br />&nbsp; File &quot;D:\programas\_nes modding\assembly\_cc65\ggsound-master\ggsound_ca65\ft_<br />txt_to_asm.py&quot;, line 754, in &lt;module&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; main()<br />&nbsp; File &quot;D:\programas\_nes modding\assembly\_cc65\ggsound-master\ggsound_ca65\ft_<br />txt_to_asm.py&quot;, line 367, in main<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; macros&#91;macro_type_to_str&#91;macro&#91;&quot;type&quot;&#93;&#93;&#93;.append(macro)<br />KeyError: 3</div><br /><br />Any ideas? Just to be clear: when simply unzipping the files to new folders it doesn't work (build demo or convert song). I have python 3.6.2 installed and the latest zips of cc65 and gg-sound.

When I try to open your file in FamiTracker 0.4.2, it says I need a newer version of FamiTracker. So I went to FamiTracker's website and got 0.4.6. Tried to open your file again. It still tells me I need a newer version. Are you using some kind of bleeding edge beta version from somewhere...? Haha.

This is listed on the guide on the <a href="https://github.com/gradualgames/ggsound" class="postlink">github page.</a><br /><br />If you're working with a sophisticated composer, they will probably need some coaxing as GGSound supports a rather limited subset of FamiTracker's features.
