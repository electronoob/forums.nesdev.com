But, UPnP/IGD is XML-based.  Draw your own conclusions from that.  Additionally, UPnP is *extremely* vendor-specific; please go digging through the uTorrent ChangeLogs to see how many times they've had to make "custom adjustments" to their methodology for UPnP to work with "vendor X" router.  This applies to all the mainstream consumer routers (Linksys, D-Link, Netgear, TrendNet, blah blah blah).  And don't let Cisco's branding of Linksys change your opinion; the company that does their firmware (a Taiwanese company called Cybertan) is still doing the firmwares.  Cisco engineers are not working on Linksys devices.<br /><br />Back to UPnP and NAT-PMP:<br /><br />You gain nothing from using either of these in this specific case, since the idea of both is to provide dynamically allocatable port forwards.  You'd still have to configure the device (the NES) to request which statically-assigned port to forward to itself.<br /><br />The idea of UPnP and NAT-PMP is to permit on-the-fly port forwards to be allocated, with a *dynamic port number* assigned to it (e.g. WAN:28483 -&gt; LAN:48981).  Does it work if the client requesting the port forward always requests the same port (e.g. WAN:80 -&gt; LAN:9183)?  Yes, but:<br /><br />In the case of a static port forward entered into the router (not induced by UPnP or NAT-PMP), if the NES is off, someone attempting to visit that port gets absolutely no response from it (in the case of TCP, no TCP SYN+ACK response to their TCP SYN packet; in the case of UDP, no response UDP packet).  So the only thing you gain from using UPnP or NAT-PMP for this is not having to configure a port forward in your router *a single time in your entire life*.<br /><br />So, use a static port forward in your router, done.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Tue Mar 08, 2011 9:29 pm</p><hr />
