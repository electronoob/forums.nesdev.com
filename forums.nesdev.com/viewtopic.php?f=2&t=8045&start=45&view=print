So for a length of 16, you'd roll in 16 bytes, then after that, old bytes get rolled out when you roll new bytes in.<br />Combine this with a hash table (that uses this hash algorithm), and you can find which strings match what you are looking for easily.  Must be the same length as your current hash.  Since hash collisions will be common, combine hash matching with full memory comparison.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The generation of the hash itself need not be so optimized; a rolling hash is a fast way to make a hash, but it's not necessarily the best hash to use. The part that you need to speed up the most is the searching, for which any hash will do. Here's an alternative to a rolling hash:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">input: string&#91;n&#93;<br />output: hash_strings&#91;16&#93;&#91;n&#93;<br /><br />for i=0; i &lt; 16; ++i<br />&nbsp; for j=0; j &lt; n; ++j<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; hash = HASH_INIT // appropriate starting value<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; for k=0; k &lt; i; ++k<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; p = j + k<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (p &gt;= n) break<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hash = hash_next( hash, string&#91;p&#93; ) // hash function that takes a byte, appends to hash<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hash_strings&#91;k&#93;&#91;j&#93; = hash<br /></div><br /><br />Since you need to hash for mutliple lengths, something like this might be just as efficient as a rolling hash, and might allow you to choose a stronger hash function. The hashing part is only O(n) anyway, or maybe O(m^2 * n) where m is the number of string lengths you need. The real savings come from the efficient search you do next.<br /><br />Once you have your hashed strings, you can build a hash table or just some sort of sort or balanced tree (either way, easy to accomplish in O(n log n)), and all your matching strings will be grouped together in the same hash bucket / contiguous sort region / branch.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry, but the lack of any 6502 code was intentional.<br /><br />Probably because I want to force the users to fully understand how the encoding actually work (instead of just copying some code and not understanding anything) - and because there is several ways decoding the same data could be done, each one with it's pros &amp; cons, and I don't see why the decoding routine should be imposed to the user.<br /><br />I'll have to study hash codes harder and optimize my encodings a little - currently I don't really understand how this hash thing works at all, so don't expect the revised to come until some time.

I'm no expert, but a codec made for graphics might not work well with other kind of data. I might be wrong though.</div><br />SLZ is a generic compression format, but it's LZ77 so it doesn't meet the &quot;random access&quot; criteria (on the Mega Drive you usually can afford to decompress entire chunks of data anyway). Also it doesn't meet the &quot;real-time&quot; criteria (by this I mean you probably should avoid using it in the middle of gameplay as it may cause framerate drops).<br /><br />UFTC was designed for decompressing sprites on the fly, and of course it <em>does</em> allow random access... for tiles. The format is designed specifically for Mega Drive tiles, and even moreso, it was designed to play to 68000's strengths, meaning it'd do bad on the NES horribly. Although I suppose you could adapt the general idea for something else to match whatever requirements you need. It's just a glorified dictionary-based format, after all.<br /><br />In practice if you really need real-time random access your best bet is to just make a dedicated format for the specific situation (as is the deal with UFTC and sprites). Dictionaries help a lot though, since you can use them as a replacement for sliding windows. And if you wonder, no, neither of those two algorithms use any RAM other than the required to store the decompressed data =P

If you seriously needed to have compact metasprite data, here's something you can try:<br /><br />A lot of times, a metasprite's sprite tiles are arranged back-to-back in a rectangle or a square:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93;<br />&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93;<br />&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93;</div><br />If you omit the X and Y positions of the sprite tiles, you can have your metasprite routine &quot;assume&quot; that you want each sprite tile to be 8 pixels to the right of the previous one. That way, you only need to store a tile and an attribute byte.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93;&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93; ---&gt;</div><br />One of the unused bits in the attribute byte can act as a &quot;carriage return&quot;, placing the sprite tile on a new row 8 pixels underneath the previous one.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93;! |<br />&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93;! |<br />&#91;5&#93;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;v</div><br />Finally, if you needed to be fancy and have overlaying sprite tiles, you can have another unused bit specify that the sprite tile comes with X and Y coordinates.<br /><br />If most of your sprites were simple squares/rectangles, storing your data like this would offer huge improvements on space, but it would add some overhead in your metasprite-decoding routine.<br /><br />Edit: Diagrams.

I once thought about saving some space by adding a second sprite decoding routine that would use the more compact rectangle representation, for simpler sprites. Each object would then call one routine or the other depending on which kind of sprites they used, but your idea is better. I already had planned something else for the unused attribute bits though (some sort of priority system), but I guess I can find another solution for that. Thanks a lot for the idea!

The output filename should also be specifiable. This way the tool would fit well in to build rules (such as Makefile).<br /><br />* For automatically generated labels, using e.g. &quot;bpe_left:&quot; instead of &quot;bpe_left&quot; is probably more compatible (I don't know if there are assemblers out there which CAN'T handle the &quot;:&quot; in there).<br /><br />* Some of the output data, such as the two MinMax values of BytePair algorithm would better fit being symbols instead of actual (.db) data.<br /><br />* Speaking of .db, I don't know what assembler you're using (WLA DX?), but CA65 doesn't understand .db (needs .byte), so it would be nice if this could be configured.<br /><br />* For whatever reason, this doesn't work:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.define foo2 2</div><br />Output:<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Error in foo.txt at line 30 :<br />For input string: &quot;2 2&quot;<br /></div><br /><tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.define foo1 2</tt> works so I don't know what it's doing there.<br /><br />* The mini assembler is kind of picky about whitespaces, this doesn't work:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.db 12,34<br /></div>
