		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So i finally got some chips and started dumping roms on them. For my first try i followed these instructions : <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.54.org/sage/condev/ff2cartproject/">http://www.54.org/sage/condev/ff2cartproject/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />At first I started wiring by his picture, but then switched to the written instructions as i understood them better. Here is a picture of how i wired them: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://i.imgur.com/d4JMQWb.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/d4JMQWb.jpg</a><!-- m --> sorry it's kinda blurry.<br /><br />When i boot it up in the NES all i get is a white screen. No sound.<br /><br />I'm not really sure what that is a symptom of. Did i wire something wrong? I checked all the pins, and for the most part they look like the others. I was thinking of adding more solder to a few of the points, but wanted to double check the wiring first.<br /><br />I am also slightly worried about how i cut the traces. Most of them look fine, but according to his instructions i was to cut the trace near pin hole 30. It didn't look like a trace was even running to that hole, but i cut at the board anyways like his picture and under the green was just solid copper. you can kinda see it in the picture i shared.<br /><br />So basically, where do i start with troubleshooting this? This is my first attempt, and I knew it wouldn't work on the first try, but I'd like to attack this problem smartly, and not just tear up the board i already started on.<br /><br />Side question, after i patch the roms and remove the header how do i test it on my pc. I have been using bsnes for the snes ones, as i was told it checks for 100% accuracy with an actual snes, but it takes .fc files for the nes. I was using ucon64 to do the patch, and remove the header files, and it leaves me with a prg binary file. How do i change that to test in bsnes, or is there a better emulator to test with that will use the prg files?<br /><br />Thanks again for the help, you guys have been invaluable to my learning experience.<br /><br />-David<br /><br />*Edit<br /><br />I have also just tried making an Earth Bound Zero cart using a Deja Vu cart. I installed the prg and chr chip, this time bending the pins instead of cutting the traces according to this chart: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/NES%20EPROM%20Conversions.txt">http://nesdev.com/NES%20EPROM%20Conversions.txt</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I went by the tkrom list and noticed that i have a couple pins that don't connect to anything. What do you do with those?<br /><br />In any effect, i got the same problem, just a white screen. <br /><br />Here's some pictures of how i wired it. <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://imgur.com/oYHEOgX">http://imgur.com/oYHEOgX</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://imgur.com/ExKiGgo">http://imgur.com/ExKiGgo</a><!-- m -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, third game, and same thing. Just a white screen.<br /><br />This time i tried to go a Final Fantasy III (I love rpgs, if you can't tell). I followed these instructions: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?StartRow=1&amp;catid=22&amp;threadid=81242">http://nintendoage.com/forum/messagevie ... adid=81242</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I used the wiring shown on the 3rd page of the comments as they had pictures. It was the same except slightly different for the battery, which shouldn't affect this.<br /><br />Here's how i did it:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://imgur.com/A1husi1">http://imgur.com/A1husi1</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://imgur.com/uF949eZ">http://imgur.com/uF949eZ</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Clearly something is being done wrong.<br /><br />I am using some ST M27C4001-12B1 with a willem gq-3x. I used ucon64 to patch the rom with the translation from romhacking.com and then removed the header and output to the necessary .prg files. I verified that the chips ID'd, and were blank, and then wrote and verified the roms (copied to increase size to 512 when necessary).<br /><br />Is there something i am missing here?
