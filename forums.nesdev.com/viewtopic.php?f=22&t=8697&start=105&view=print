Unless he makes a 256KB BNROM game from a 128KB UNROM game where the last 16KB of every bank is the same.

On second thought That might not be case, I have some ideas if both parties are interested we can discuss them elsewhere.  I don't want to do more damage to this thread.

I hope OAM cycling is part of the final polishing? Or you'd probably even prefer to have the score disappear completely rather than the player/obstacles flickering too much...</div><br />Honestly, I don't find it much of a problem when playing the game because most of the action tends to be towards the center of the screen. So, we'll see how it goes after the ROM is released, I guess. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I mostly expect to do a final beta testing round this coming week.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">infiniteneslives wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Are there any plans to publish this?  I'd like to support the cause and buy a copy if possible.  I'm guessing there is some grey area on rights to the material and such though?  I just dislike the idea of how all the greedy/pirate reproshops are going to make a killing off your work...  Might be a good selling point for the compo carts should they ever get published, but Tepples would have to move away from BNROM I guess.</div><br />Cart release is a possibility. I don't think there's any grey area, all of the content is original, and the author of the Flash version is OK with the idea of making carts. I am hopeful that the reproshops have enough dignity to not sell carts of this without permission. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">As for the mapper, would it be real hard to convert the code from UNROM (which has a fixed bank) to BNROM (which doesn't)? I can embed a BNROM in a BNROM.</div><br />Hard to say, but I may look into it at some point in the future.<br /><br />Of course if the multicart had a custom mapper with UNROM support, it probably would make it easier to find 53 games to fill it (Driar's 64KB UxROM conversion comes to mind as an another example).

I'll start a new topic about it once it's further along in prototyping. But one drawback is that including a bunch of non-NROM games will require bigger flash chips.

The ceiling at the top is also only 16 pixels tall.<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Z0oX2.png" alt="Image" /><br />Everything in dark blue is in the no-mans-land on my 1981 TV.  Look at old NES games like Zelda 1, Super Mario Bros, and Zelda 2.  Notice how they avoid putting anything important in the very top or bottom of the screen.  In fact, in Zelda 1, the very bottom row is always a copy of the row right above it (for collision purposes).<br /><br />Even PocketNES is going to crop away the top 16 and bottom 10 scanlines, before it scales the screen to 75% of its original height.<br /><br />On a PC-based emulator or an LCD or Plasma TV, the cropping won't be a problem.

But even then, there's not much I can do to fix this due to the original resolution of the levels. I did think about adding vertical scrolling as an option, but didn't want to prematurely fix what could turn out to be a non-problem after all.<br /><br />We'll see after the ROM release how big of a problem this really is.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My Vizio LCD TV crops the top and bottom 8 lines of the NES's 240p signal, but nothing on the left and right. I think the &quot;stupid reason&quot; is ultimately that a lot of video sources are noisy in the top and bottom 8 lines of each field. The picture might have artifacts of VHS or the like, a TV station might be using the top and bottom lines for some sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overscan#Datacasting" class="postlink">data broadcast</a>, or the program might even have boom mics that are just barely in the shot but out of the action safe area.<br /><br />My Magnavox CRT TV crops similarly to PocketNES on the top and bottom: more lines are cropped on the top than on the bottom. I'm not sure whether this centering disparity is due to the 262-line fields (not 262.5 like the standard) or the 341-dot scanlines (not 341.25 like the standard). I might need to do some experiments with a Sega Genesis to distinguish these; it has 262-line fields but 342-dot lines if I recall correctly.
