<br />
<br />This is really annoying because when there are many new posts I often open again things I've already read. The only way to get rid of the orange icons is to log out and back on.
<br />
<br />Isn't this happening to anyone else?
<br />
<br />EDIT: Even this topic, which I just posted, shows up as unread for me. This shouldn't ever happen with topics <strong>I</strong> create.

Giving them complete focus (i.e. not opening other anything else at the same time) doesn't solve the problem, they remain orange no matter what I do.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">We have about a month and a half left.</div>
<br />True. We still don't know where the new home for NESDEV will be.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually I'm getting the opposite effect.
<br />When I browse this forum with my Android phone(like now), occasionally all the threads will be marked as read in a sudden, making it difficult to keep track of whether a thread has a new reply.
<br />I suspect this is because I am usually moving during a session, and the connection will switch between mobile data and wifi once a while. The change in IP address may be a cause of this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think I know what causes the opposite problem. phpBB 2 creates a new "session" whenever you log in, or when your session times out (after about one hour) while "keep me logged in" is turned on. When you're logged in, there's a newest session (the one you're looking at) and a second newest session. Everything posted before the second newest session is assumed to have been read in order to keep the (user, topic) matrix small.

<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Please keep in mind PHP sessions can be either server-side files (which is common), or implemented via cookies.  For cookies, session.cookie_lifetime is used, which we use the default value of 0 (cookie lasts until the browser is closed).
<br />
<br />It all depends on how the PHP application is programmed.  But remember: why move to phpBB 2.x when everything here just works, right?  *chuckle* phpBB... I guess the BB stands for BIG BUTTS.  j/k  So I believe the root cause is simply how the software is written (badly).  Folks need to remember that this version of phpBB is from 2005.
<br />
<br />I don't see any server-side session files laying around for the forum/bbs.  I do see some for the wiki, but they're not stale/old.
<br />
<br />And FWIW, I don't experience this problem, but *have* seen similar behaviour on other boards running some phpBB version or derivative.

Saved form data should be fine to keep.  If you use CCleaner, this would be what to clear:<br /><br />Applications -&gt; Firefox/Mozilla:<br />[x] Internet Cache<br />[x] Internet History<br />[x] Cookies<br />[x] Session<br />[x] Site preferences<br /><br />And if you use IE:<br /><br />Windows -&gt; Internet Explorer<br />[x] Temporary Internet Files<br />[x] History<br />[x] Cookies<br /><br />The new server does appear to have PHP sessions enabled (server-side; I can see them all in /tmp), stored on server, while the sessions GC runs less aggressively than on Parodius.  So this is probably a client issue.<br /><br />As far as &quot;seeing the title being enough to consider it read&quot;, I believe there is no way to change this behaviour.  phpBB 2.x did it differently than phpBB 3.x.
