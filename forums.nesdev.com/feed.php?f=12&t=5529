I'm using PIC24H for the mcu.  I needed something large enough and fast enough to handle the SD card okay.  Due to unknown and or undocumented issues with the pic chip (I've already found one undocumented bug/"feature") the timing doesn't seem to work as planned for supporting some DSP1 emulation features.  It may still be possible, but I'm not going to waste anymore time on it right now.  (Some games expect crazy fast response, such as write command, write data, read response ... absolutely no pause.  They don't wait for RQM at all.)<br /><br />For as simple as SNES mapping is, I was amazed at how much logic it took to make a simplified version of the SF3 was.  I got the design to fit in the CPLD, so I should be good to go, but I'd really like to use some of its features better ... but I'm struggling with the Xilinx's software.  Their support department refuses to talk to students, and their support documents are aweful.  The software sent with a cpld kit was actual outdated enough that it couldn't be installed, and their tutorials don't match versions currently available.  I'd like to reduce the mA needed, but the fitter completely ignores my timing constraints and just does what it wants.  So currently I can only get it to work if I set everything to fast and just accept the additional power usage.  If anyone is familiar with Xilinx software, and would be interested in helping look over the design, please let me know.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=716">neviksti</a> — Sun Aug 30, 2009 1:42 am</p><hr />

Using a SuperCard would have complications: <ul><li>The BIOS issue, as Dwedit pointed out. </li><li>The interface circuitry would need something to translate between the roughly N64-RAMBUS-ish 16-bit multiplexed address and data bus in the GBA and the non-multiplexed 8-bit bus on the Super NES cart edge.

What about sticking a GBA SuperCard inside a cartridge, converting the voltage, and hoping it works?<br />Obviously you'd need a mapper, because the 32MB address space is too big, and there would need to be a way to switch the supercard bewteen BIOS/IO mode and RAM mode.  Can't do that without twiddling the highest address bits.<br />Probably would also need a custom BIOS which would run SNES code instead of GBA code.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Fri Aug 28, 2009 7:15 pm</p><hr />

I'm trying to make a SNES flash cart that can hold multiple games with SD card + (potentially) onboard DSP1 support.  My first simplified prototype has run its course and I'm currently ordering prototypes of the full (hopefully final) version.  I'm having fun and would like to share my work with others, but it is quickly becoming apparent that I will have to risk quite a bit of money and charge ~ $120 per cart just to hope to break even.  I don't care if I lose too much money, as the main point is to hopefully share my fun with others, but I wouldn't be willing to risk too much ... What I'm trying to say, is that if my experiences have shown me anything, it is that you probably won't be seeing an affordable SFX and SA1 and C4 and SDD1 and etc. capable cart with FPGA anytime soon.<br /><br />If someone does make an "everything" SNES hardware emulator cart, it will either be a personal project, or will be something like what Kevin was shooting for a couple years ago with his awesome hardware console emulator in that it will be: probably be a short run of pre-orders, with a significant cost, and only for those that understand exactly what they are buying (ie. somewhat capable of programming it themselves).<br /><br />For those wanting to tinker with other co-processors, it seems more reasonable to me for them to modify a cart to make a dedicated EEPROM (or flash) cartridge for those purposes ... because the jump from handling all the memory mapping capabilities, to emulating a full co-processor, is very far from being a small step in price and capability.<br /><br />(EDIT: For those interested, my current design's intended features:<br />- fits in a PAL and NTSC cartridge shell<br />- has a microcontroller to read the SD card<br />- microcontroller can act as a simple co-processor if one so chooses (more useful for homebrew -- do not expect emulation, but I'm trying DSP1 and can currently play MarioKart and some of PilotWings)<br />- 128Mbit flash, which can support up to 31 games on the cart (so you don't have to wait for flash programming every frickin time)<br />- 2Mbit SRAM, battery backed, and can support multiple games<br />- and to make it easy on those really wanting to fiddle with it ... both the microcontroller code and CPLD are fully reprogrammable / updatable without the need for special programming cables (after my initial programming of course)<br /><br />I don't know how much free time I'll have, but a lot of programming is already done from previous version.  Maybe I can start releasing it in 2 months?<br />)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=716">neviksti</a> — Fri Aug 28, 2009 5:34 pm</p><hr />

Well you have to think, do you want to build something like this or do you just want to have something like this? If you just want to have something like this you have options and if you wait there may be more options. <br /><br />If you are actually interested in building one yourself go right ahead, learn the things you need to know.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Thu Aug 27, 2009 5:35 pm</p><hr />

With my current knowledge of the subject,  I don't really know how to interface with an FPGA let alone most of the SNES hardware. I have more of a software background with high level compilers like C or C++. I will have to study how the low level hardware works before attempting to get too involved in the project. I understand the basics of a computer system, but low level hardware accessing is a bit past my expertise right now.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3995">pcmantinker</a> — Thu Aug 27, 2009 2:37 pm</p><hr />
