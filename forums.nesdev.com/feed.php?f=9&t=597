Check out Veilleux's boardtable and you have all licenced US/PAL releases with their publisher and their board names. Just google NES+Boardtable to found it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Sep 26, 2005 9:54 am</p><hr />

I just realized that maybe I should get a frickin willem programmer and some eeproms or flashroms or whatever before I start even talking about that subject at all. I really want that game on a cart! and I am so afraid of disabling the lockout chip, because I really don't know what I'm doing in that field. I was actually just thinking about getting a toploader just because I was so afraid that I would ruin my NES. Well, do you guys know any NES carts with mapper 4, and battery? I just want to know for future reference.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Sep 25, 2005 5:07 pm</p><hr />

I can understand your frustation, I also was a bit confused when I open my Mario/Tetris/Super Spike V Ball card, I also saw these blobs and the board is NES-ZZ that is also confusing.<br />Refering to veilleux's boardtable, your game I didn't know off uses TLROM, so hasn't SRAM nor battery.<br />You will probably need to have a TKROM board to put FF3 on it, and does tons of modification to have CHRAM instead of CHROM like glue an additionnal pin to the cartidge connector. Ask drk414 for more info, he did it.<br />I agree it's better to destroy a common and suck game to make your own card, but sometimes it's hard to found an adequate one, because it's too good to be destroyed, or too rare. Crystalis maybe, I peronally don't like too much that game (even if many people do), and I guess think it's rather common in the states.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Sep 25, 2005 12:46 pm</p><hr />

that sucks! good thing I know that now. I frickin' went through all the trouble of taking off the label of this one cart, and putting a label that said Nintendo DevCart No mapper on it, and I took it apart, and it was one of those crappy things! that sucks... Then I had to take off the label of my other Mario/Duck Hunt cart, and that sucked! and then I had to take the DevCart label off of my other M/DH cart, and put it on there! that was bad. Hey, I was wondering, you know the game Bad Dudes? yeah, since that uses mapper 4, would you be able to write Final Fantasy III to that? I don't own the game, and I don't plan to because it's awful. But does that game use battery? Do you know?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Sep 25, 2005 11:31 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Celius wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />When it has a gap, does that signify that it has blobs, and not chips?<br /></div><br /><br />Yep, that's the case with Mario/Duckhunt carts.  Most of them are the blob kind though.<br /><br />What they've done is taken the bare chip, and instead of putting it in a plastic package (wired to pins), they wire the chip directly to the board.  Then they put a glob of epoxy on top to hold it down and protect it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Sep 25, 2005 10:04 am</p><hr />

Okay, this is a really really dumb unprofessional newbie question, but anyway, I took apart a cart that I was going to use as a devcart, and I looked in it, and it didn't even have chips! it had these blobs of black stuff! I'm sorry, I should probably know this, but what are those? and also, the cart  thing that you insert into the NES itself had a gap in the middle that had no pins. All carts that I've taken apart that had chips in it had all pins on that. When it has a gap, does that signify that it has blobs, and not chips?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Sep 25, 2005 8:59 am</p><hr />
