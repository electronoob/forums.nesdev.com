<br />Yes this is a NES site, but the Snes has to be closely related enough to deserve a little spot over there in the corner.

<br />You are right.. Well I could ask a friend of mine who has some servers

<br />Maybe parodius.com could host such boards? Putting a general copier

<br />
<br />Question is if/how that could be avoided or limited ? Removing
<br />unwanted topics and banning users might work, but that would
<br />require quite some dedication from an admin I suppose.

<br />Bah.. can't think straight .. 03:27am.. off to bed

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Cherryroms used to have stickied FAQ threads but that for the most part didn't help. If a thread two inches from their own was too hard to find, I'm not sure how they'll make their way to a wiki.
<br />
<br />Pocket Heaven still isn't primarily a copier oriented board, what I had in mind were boards such as the late Cherryroms, late Red #9, Success-HK forums, Tototek board, for the most part Dextrose, Generation X V64 forum and some smaller boards which have a even harder time keeping discussion legal and remotely interesting.

<br />I have excess hosting space (and bandwidth) at the moment.  So I'd be willing to host a backup of cherryroms (if someone knows who to ask for it), as well as hosting a new forum if you'd like.
<br />
<br />I use a lot of forums, but I know little to nothing about how to start one successfully and manage it so it stays so.  But I'd be willing to try.  Kyuusaku, if you are really interested in starting such a board, let me know and maybe we can get one going.

There are a couple of email addresses and an AIM name you can see on that page.  Not sure if any of them would know who to contact, but it's worth a shot I guess.  I really don't think any of them were admin or mods on there, as it looks like there was just a bunch of arguing on that thread.
