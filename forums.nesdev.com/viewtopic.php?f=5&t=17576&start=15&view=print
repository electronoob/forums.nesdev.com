		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The only thing that would be useful to confirm is the legality for screenshots, like the one that was used (but is now removed) for explaining scrolling.  Using existing game screenshot to show a behavior is always useful and should hopefully be tolerated since so many site use them in other scenario but for now it's better to be careful until it can be confirmed.<br /><br />Rom, same opinion here, it's not our responsibility since we are a community for development.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry for the double post but I got my answer from Nintendo (I did send them a simple email on the subject to their legal department) and the answer is in the line with what Koitsu said:<br /><br />- We are happy that you have interest in our assets<br />- We receive too many request to answer legal question about usage of them<br />so<br />- ask a lawyer<br /><br />So... Unless we ask a lawyer for any particular use of Nintendo assets, it's better to be safe than sorry.  I kind of knew it was  going to be that kind of answer that I would receive but hey, it only cost me the time to ask the question in that case.  So the legal section in the &quot;contact us&quot; is completely useless, it's just to look nice and that's it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As usual, I'm not a lawyer, but once again this is in pretty comprehensible territory. Using video game screenshots as methods of explaining game mechanics, etc. has long been established as &quot;fair use&quot; without any kind of doubt. I'd say you have to go the route of something like Spriters Resource (ie. copyrighted material for the sake of the material itself, as well as pretty comprehensive rips) to reach an actual infringement scenario.<br /><br />Meanwhile, hosting NSF files, full of copyrighted music - though never considered bad faith by anyone, including most original rights holders, that is technically completely illegal.<br />It's one of those situations where people just get away with it, because no one even cares, including the original musicians or even Nintendo. But since it's illegal, I'd say there's an obvious treshold here, which I am glad to see NesDev not wanting to cross.<br />For screenshots though, I still consider their removal excessively pedantic.
