Since you're going the full Kickstarter route with this, I guess I should address some design issues I had with the competition entry. I didn't see this covered while skimming the thread, so I figured it was worth pointing out. Sorry in advance if it's stuff that's already in your pipeline. Apart from these two points I think the game is very solid, and definitely deserved winning.<br /><br />1. The special weapons weren't really obvious.

This was actually the last of the entries I played, and I quite enjoyed it. The graphics were nice (especially the level intros, as others have mentioned) and the game's engine felt pretty solid. <br /><br />I did notice some of the flickering everyone's talking about, but I didn't find it all that disruptive. Thanks for a fun game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6316">cppchriscpp</a> — Sat Feb 11, 2017 3:18 pm</p><hr />

Simultaneous 2-player would kick ass! It can be somewhat difficult to implement though, since it affects the behavior of the camera, and the object system must be able to handle a second player (i.e. no hardcoded state variables if you don't want to duplicate all the logic). Another concern is the low number of palettes, if each player uses a different palette.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Feb 02, 2017 4:09 pm</p><hr />
