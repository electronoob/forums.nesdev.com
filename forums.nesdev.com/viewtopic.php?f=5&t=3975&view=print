		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have been wanting this for a wile and have discussed it with others but that is not going to make it happen. 
<br />
<br />Basically I want to be able to switch the buttons so they are in the correct position for GBA mode and switch back with ease. It should be possible to do this using a microcontroller. Obviously It could also be done with switches or jumpers but thatâ€™s too awkward and impractical 
<br />
<br />My question is what must I learn to make this real? 
<br />
<br />I know there are BASIC compilers made for various microcontrollers but would that be a good choice? 
<br />
<br />What programming language would you recommend I learn for this purpose and what additional information do I need? Also is there a better approach than what I am leaning towards? Links would be appreciated. 
<br />
<br />I know basic electronics so I can understand the kind of physical circuitry witch would be necessary to an extent and I am quite good at soldering.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Before leaping into such a complex project, it might be a good idea to find out what controls the GBA button mapping. Is it hardwired, or configured by the DS's firmware? If it's the latter, all you'd need is a relatively simple firmware upgrade (much simpler than anything involving a microcontroller).

<br />
<br />This way you could mod in a toggle switch to swap the buttons physically or if you must use a MCU, you could program it to detect a key sequence to toggle maps. With the MCU you'd need 4 inputs, 2 outputs if I understand it correctly (multiplex YX and BA to YX right?), probably even a 12C508 could do it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />think I already understand the hardware wiring aspect and what I had in mind was a little different to yours 
<br />
<br />I hope I am explaining this in a way witch makes since 
<br />
<br />The goal is Y becomes B and B becomes A for GBA mode 
<br />
<br />since Y and X do nothing in gba mode stock, the DS can think Y and B are getting pressed at the same time every time I press Y so I should not even have to cut any traces to Y but instead just send Y's output to B's output. X will be left stock. B needs to be cut so it can take Y's output and send its output to A. It dose not matter if A remains A as long as B is also A so its about the same setup as Y 
<br />
<br />The MCU just has to tern off its connections to A and Y in DS mode and have B's input sent back to B 
<br />
<br />Did that make since? if so that would work right? 
<br />
<br />Well anyway I still need the programming aspect and perhaps info on something I am missing. 
<br />
<br />Help learning what I need to there would be nice

<br />
<br />If you have an extra pin though, I suggest using select in your
<br />button sequence to minimize the chance of it happening during DS gameplay.

<br />the error is for line 15 "If without THEN"
<br />
<br />I know its due to it not knowing  what to do if there is nothing on PORTB.0  but I do not know the correct way to enter the command to tell it to goto nds_mode;   I tryed a few things encludeing else but haveing trouble figureing it out
<br />I also dont think goto MCU_reset: is nessasery but that is nether here nor there
<br />
<br />
<br />edit:although I have not solved my actual main problem yet I an updateing my code to include things I forgot to add like the code to tern the ports on for exsample
<br />edit2:I now realise terning all the ports on is not correct and  I also see a possiple mistake in the way I am trying to sync them but I will worry about that after I take care of my one problem.
<br />edit3:FINALLY I figured out a way to view the commands list.doc witch I could not get my computer to open. Now I should be able to proceed smoothley.
<br />I belive I have fixed my problem I could not solve before. Now all I gotta do is hammer out the dents
<br />
<br />I know its simple for a lot of you but I will get there if you would like to help me along that would be nice 
<br />keep in mind all standard PIC assembly nemonics can be used along with the BASIC stuff

<br />
<br />also I think I might have to do somthing like this
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">if PORTB.1 = on&nbsp; then SET PORTB.3 ON <br />if PORTB.1 = off then SET PORTB.3 off<br /></div>

<br />so get it to mimmic my button presses I know thats not qute right ether 
<br />PORTB.1 = PORTB.3  probubley dose the exsact same thing though and I am just being foolish
<br />but I plan on firgureing that out after I figure out the I/O stuff 
<br />
<br />
<br />edit2: OK I think I have everything figured out now and have revised my source accordingley once I figure out where the hell I put my PIC's I can start the testing process. I may have to buy a smaller package type to fit it inside a DS though
<br />
<br />btw not that it matters but I am not actually usieing a 16F819 I just put that in temperarially so I could get it to compile because it was convenient for me
<br />
<br />
<br />Also why are you all ignoreing me? have I done somehting to offend everyone?

<br />I don't think anyone's ignoring you, it's just that you're almost done and I'm sure you can figure the last bit out yourself; We also don't all necessarily have MCU experience (I know I don't have much) nor do we know the correct syntax for your compiler or how to make use of the I/O pins (they must certainly be documented) so there may be nothing we can do to help you further.
