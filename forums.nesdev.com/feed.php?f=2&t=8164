Again, it's very much my goal to make the best of little. In my art and film work i only ever use a limited palette. Keeping things simple is often the most effective way, and it definitely suits my style.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Everything you've said really sounds like Limbo.

Yeah Limbo looks very cool indeed, i'll check out more of that for sure. I think an uneasy atmosphere can definitely be created on the NES, with the right narrative and visuals, the right scripting etc. I remember being scared just reading Fighting Fantasy gamebooks, or playing games like NES Robocop. When ED209 came on the screen i nearly shit my pants. Of course, todays gamers may not feel this way, but they're not exactly the target audience. Also, i should mention that part of the fun of this project will be presenting it as a game made in 1989, as opposed to a game that has just been developed. A lost game, so to speak. One of the enjoyable things about that is that people will be forced to look at the game in context, even if its an unknowingly fictional one.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />So, I'm out of reasons. I could do even do it, I'm just not sure I'd want to. I guess I understand your goals with this whole thing. You're a person that likes trouble.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /></div><br /><br />Haha, well i can't deny that in some respects. I'm definitely looking to cause a bit of mischief with the way the viewer engages with the work, but in terms of creating the game, i really just want to do something a bit different. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />If I see a prototype/good mockups I'll be less of a killjoy about this. Especially if I can just slightly modify the engines I've already got. Because, hey, I wouldn't mind being paid for this. But bleh. Like everyone else, I play the waiting game until I see something that has something to do with NES to get me excited about the project.<br /></div><br /><br />I totally understand yours and everyone else's reservations about any project proposal like this. Everyone here has been a really good sport about it though, and i've had so much help already, not to mention a fair bit of interest in involvement, so i definitely realise it's up to me now. I'm not going to try and forcibly persuade anybody of my intentions; i realise that i need to pull this brief together, some design ideas, as well as some audio and visual work. I hope then people will see the potential to be excited about what i want to achieve.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />One last question: Is all this going to be released at once? (seems so, but I gotta ask)<br /></div><br /><br />Esssentially yes. The film and the game and a couple of other facets will be part of an exhibition in the summer of 2013 (and then hopefully many other exhibitions after that, i already have a great deal of interest from people in this) It's also a project that i intend to keep expanding. I have a LOT of ideas for this expansion, and i'm happy to take my time doing them. The deadline for the film and the game is essentially two years from now. I plan on spending much of this year working on more prototype sketches for the film, art and music etc and then the second year (late 2012 - late 2013) executing the final works.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Since the film could (maybe) possibly inspire game ideas if it could be seen first.<br /></div><br /><br />Absolutely. The film won't need to be finished to do that. In many ways i want to actively work on them in parallel. Already, they've begun to inspire each other which is great. I have one moment planned in the film for example where a character performs an action. Over the last day or so i've realised that this will provide an excellent central mechanic for a game. In turn i decided to re-incorporate that mechanic in greater depth in the film.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Edit: Oooh, another question. <br /><br />For things like source code, what will you need? I imagine that source of the actual game, but that may or may not be useless to you. Say you have a falling out with a programmer who has a completely custom map format, and you never get the source or exe for his map editor?<br /></div><br /><br />This is my main worry. I'm not worried about falling out with a programmer, i'm a very easy person to work with. I am however worried about commitment. This is a serious project and it has a very real deadline. Commitment is crucial. This is why i want to bring money to the table in some capacity; so that the person working on the programming not only feels appreciated and is being compensated for their work, but also that it is a professional engagement. I'm very much looking to have a great working relationship with a programmer and good chemistry, but the bottom line is i'm hoping to hire someone to do a job and treat it professionally.<br /><br />For these reasons i will be looking towards safeguarding the situation from the get-go so that should that person be unable to finish the work, it would be possible for another to continue the work. I imagine we would have to enter into a contract of some sort, but as of yet, being very noobish myself, i'm unsure of the best way to do this. I don't want to worry about this too much right now, i'm not eager to get all serious about things during a phase where i think it is important to be creative, i just want to make sure i'm aware of potential problems, and again this aspect of the process is something that nearer the time i'm hoping you guys will be able to help me with!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5021">Sendo</a> â€” Tue Dec 13, 2011 5:14 pm</p><hr />

When i was a kid it didn't matter if a game sucked, i only had a few of them so i played it to death anyway. I remember one year we got Home Alone for the SNES. Christ that game was bad, but i had nothing else to play so i found ways to enjoy it, and i found fun in the suckiness. Sometimes i'd want to smash the cartridge, but i'd still go back for more! <br /><br />I think this is something missing from modern games, particularly of late with the 360 and PS3. Expectations are insanely high, and in many ways the culture is quite throwaway. It takes a lot more effort on behalf of the developer to cause a gamer to really engage with a piece of software now. Average gamers are too quick to drop a difficult title, whereas back then i think there was more perseverance (even if the difficulty was abstract and frustrating), it was more hardcore in many ways.<br /><br />I also like the way that film games often bent the film to suit the system. Just as almost all arcade ports where 'run and gun' or scrolling beat em up, NES games were often very action based, regardless of whether that fitted the vibe of the film. Batman <em>was</em> a great game, but i don't remember any point in the film where Batman walked along the street punching little robots that looked like wind up trains.<br /><br />It's exactly this kind of irreverence i want to achieve. I'm not looking to re-create the film in the form of a game, i'm looking to use the NES to capture the meaning and expression of the film in the form of a game, but in a form that is inherently dictated by the style and aesthetic of the NES as a development and artistic platform, if that makes sense?!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5021">Sendo</a> â€” Tue Dec 13, 2011 2:35 pm</p><hr />

Hey man i'm back.<br /><br />Ok, i'll explain the project that i'm working on in a bit more detail. I certainly see where you're coming from but there's several very important reasons why i want to make a game for the NES.<br /><br />Firstly it's not just about wanting to make a game for the sake of making a game. This is important. The NES game that i want to make is a smaller part of larger project that studies the dissemination of media within a specific era, that being the late 80's early 90's.<br /><br />So the idea is to make a film, and to create a game of the film that functions and represents within the limitations (both physically and aesthetically) of that time period. It has to be historically accurate in every way (or at least as far as is physically possible).<br /><br />The integrity of this is massively important and it's for that reason that i can't make it for PC for example. <br /><br />It's for the same reason that the film i'm making (the digitally shot links above are merely aesthetic sketches) is being shot on 8 or 16mm film. Of course i could shoot it on digital, saving a lot of time and expense, but that would completely defeat the object of the project.<br /><br />In preparing for this i looked into the possibility of making a game for Master System, Megadrive, SNES and NEO GEO since these consoles also fit in terms of what i'm looking to achieve. However, it was suggested to me that NES was the way to go out of the five. This was coupled with the fact that the NES holds a particular resonance with me as it was the first real console i had as a kid back in 1989.<br /><br />So yeah, essentially, it's a lot more than just a project to make a fun game. It is part of a much larger artwork. The content is crucial, of course, but what is equally crucial is the integrity of the physical aesthetic as this is the vehicle for the message i wish to explore and a huge part of how i want people to engage with this aspect of the project. I want people to be able to see something that is indistinguishable from the past, to evoke memory, for them to open the box, take out the cartridge, put it in the machine and experience whatever it has to offer. <br /><br />The box, the case, the manual, the cartridge, the physical interaction. All of these things are as important as the game itself.<br /><br />(This is also why the film is only being duplicated on VHS and film)<br /><br />In the same way, it's the reason why i actively want to work with and within the limitations of the console. I'm not concerned with making a complicated game and trying to push the NES beyond what has previously been capable; i want to look at the architecture of the system with a programmer, i want us to study my design brief and say, right, what's the most effective way of achieving the expression of this idea, bearing in mind what we have to work with. In exactly the same way as people did back in the day, condensing a much larger and more complex piece of work into something simple and effective. This is artistry that i really respect and i think it has a really unique beauty.<br /><br />I hope that all makes sense!? Would love to hear your thoughts. You guys have been really helpful so far, so i appreciate everything you have to say <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5021">Sendo</a> â€” Tue Dec 13, 2011 1:22 pm</p><hr />

The first thing: Two of the vimeo links link to the same thing.<br />The second thing: Have you seen or played <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCA79zPaQe0" class="postlink">this game?</a> <br /><br />It seems to be very similar to what you want to do, especially in terms of atmosphere. IS it? <br /><br />The third thing: If it is, why oh why oh why does this need to be on NES?<br /><br />I'm a guy who can program for things that aren't NES, and is currently making a project for NES that is more complex than most NES games go. (Making an 8way scrolling platformer with slopes+two players simultaneous co-op) And as that guy, I really, really want to know. I realize a lot of people have subtly tried to talk you out of this before, but I have to try as well.<br /><br />To be honest: With my current project (one that I am in complete control of and answer to no one) I feel like I am <strong><em>wasting my time</em></strong> with NES. I've been on the game for like two years and I keep having to optimize things so that it doesn't drop frames because NES is slow.<br /><br />In a WEEK I could get done what I have done for NES on anything modern. And it'd be better and never drop frames. In fact, the only reason I'm STILL DOING IT for NES is that I've started at got this far... may as well keep going. Starting a new complicated project? I'll go for PC, thanks. <br /><br />For more perspective: I'm probably totally capable of doing what you have in mind for NES. (If it's like Limbo without slopes, I might even call it easy) But... Limbo's atmosphere can't really be created on NES. Throughout the entire project, I'd question why we weren't working with something that could really bring it home.<br /><br />I understand your want for a game, I really do. But NES?<br /><br />If it's a nostalgia thing, I get it. But then, you could hire out an easy NES game to say you did it. <br /><br />Because sticking with NES makes things intentionally difficult for your programmers. You making NES music, and NES graphics is fine. In fact, I could take those things and make a retraux game (think Megaman 9 or 10) in no time at all.<br />(I write a lot, and people skim. So I'm making the following text larger because it is important)<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Here's another way to think about it. Whether you make a retraux game (Megaman 9 or 10), or an actual NES game you are doing the same amount of work, correct? All the graphics and music will be the same either way. But when the switch is made from retraux to NES and you are the programmer for the project, the workload SKYROCKETS!</span><br /><br />If it were me, you'd probably end up paying me <strong><em>at least</em></strong> 8 times as much for this on NES than if I made it for... PC, or whatever else.<br /><br />Edit: Oh yeah, and prototyping is a very good idea.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> â€” Tue Dec 13, 2011 12:00 pm</p><hr />

That's an interesting idea. I definitely want to have a fully functioning NES cart by the end of the project, but a prototype which illustrates the nature and flow of the game might be a very good idea, thanks!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5021">Sendo</a> â€” Tue Dec 13, 2011 11:39 am</p><hr />

I'd also consider going as far as making your own prototype game.  Use Game Maker or Construct for the PC.  These programs drastically lower the bar for multimedia and game programming.  Who knows, you might choose to just use your prototype!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4942">slobu</a> â€” Tue Dec 13, 2011 11:35 am</p><hr />

Hello guys, just wanted to let you know that i've still been working hard on this idea.<br /><br />I'm just about to finish the first semester of my Masters Degree, so far the work i've been doing has been invaluable towards understanding how i want to go about designing aspects of this game and how i want to implement my ideas. I have a basic idea together and i've also been working on some short film sketches that explore some of the themes (noir, body horror, bio technology, dance, abstract narrative, working within limitation etc)  i wish to employ in the game. If anyone is interested in those you can check them out here:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://vimeo.com/33264729">http://vimeo.com/33264729</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://vimeo.com/31410070">http://vimeo.com/31410070</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://vimeo.com/32550028">http://vimeo.com/32550028</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Anyway, after receiving some much appreciated advice from Shiro a while back, i've decided that the best way forward for the project is probably if i go ahead and create much of the art and lay out the design brief before any programming begins. I'm in a position financially and time wise to do that now, so i'll be asking a few questions over in the Newbie Help Centre, and i really hope you guys might be able to help me out <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5021">Sendo</a> â€” Mon Dec 12, 2011 11:11 pm</p><hr />

Hey, thanks a lot for your response, sorry i was a bit slow in replying, my computer is temporarily dead (at least i hope it's temporary!).<br /><br />Awesome that you're interested man, there's actually a few guys who have contacted me now and it seems like the best bet is for me to bring a design brief together which explains more about what i want to do so you guys can have a better understanding of my goals for the game, and then hopefully someone will be up for taking up the project.<br /><br />Totally understand your issue with commitment. Although it's worth bearing in mind that since this project is going to be connected to my MA work, it will have a two year deadline, i'm hoping that should be enough time for a project of this type?<br /><br />Regarding graphics, this part i'm actually hoping to largely take on myself, although having said that i'm in no way against a degree of collaboration in this department, so will certainly keep you posted on that if it's something you're interested in <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> It's also an area that i'm going to need some help in developing my skills, so i'd love to pick your brains at some point over some ideas and techniques too. Did you draw the image in your avatar? It looks fantastic!<br /><br />Your project sounds cool, would definitely love to see what you've come up with, especially how you've handled the art etc. When i''m back up and running on my own computer again i'll definitely drop you a message!<br /><br />Thanks for your advice about my questions, again, when i'm back on my own machine i'll start a couple of threads in the newbie help centre.<br /><br />Cheers man!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5021">Sendo</a> â€” Sun Oct 02, 2011 11:50 pm</p><hr />
