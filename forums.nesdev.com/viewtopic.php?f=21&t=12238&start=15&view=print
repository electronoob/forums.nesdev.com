You can fit a couple more frames by trimming metasprites around the frames, but you're going to run into problems if you plan on using 10 frames.  Gunstar Heroes on the Sega Genesis, only uses 4 frames of explosion animation, so it can't be that bad.

Since large enemies aren't going to be present through out the entire level and only specific areas, it could work then if you change the frames in the explosion by using DMA. (can't DMA change about 8 64x64 sprites in one frame?) So the explotion wouldn't fit in vram, but it could still work in specially scripted areas.

Then 38 lines * 1324 clocks per line / 8 clocks per byte = about 6 KiB that can be copied per vblank, which needs to include the 544-byte OAM display list plus any updates to nametables, sprite tiles, and background tiles. A single 64x64 pixel sprite cel is 64*64/2 = 2 KiB.

Anyway, I already know that the first frame of the explosion fits in a 40x40 box, but I plan to use 16x16 and 32x32 sized sprites, you would put it in a 48x48 box. With that being said, you could put 5 of the first frame explosions on a scan line and have 32 pixels left over, I decided to make this as an example of what I want to do. (The explosions will spread apart when they get bigger to avoid overdraw problems and for awesomeness. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> )<br /><br />This is saying how it will work:<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

How is Final Fight 3 able to display 2 characters and 3 enemies that look to use almost about 16 8x8 tiles, which would be about 5 64x64 sprites? Or am I just crazy? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> (I know the game uses giant black bars to make it look like the sprites are bigger though.)

	</div><br />I'm sure there's no real answer to this question except &quot;just do it&quot;, but do you know a good way to animate something like this, while still keeping it pretty consistent with the other frames? I currently darken the picture a bit, increase the size of the picture, then I just make it a bit more gnarled looking. I use Gimp and I have each layer be a separate frame of animation.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Animating explosions is one of the hardest things you can do in pixel art, IMO. Sure you can go the cheap way and just change the size or something if your game has heavily stylized graphics (Mega Man got away with plain circles, for crying out loud), but if you want more natural explosions you'll have to work a little harder.<br /><br />One type of explosion that I think works really well is to start with a sudden burst, with spike-like shapes coming from the center. That has to be quick, so maybe only 2 frames until the burst reaches its full size. After that, the tips of the spikes slow down and disappear, and a big portion of the center quickly burns and starts turning into smoke, going from yellow/red to gray/brown. Then the smoke gets darker and moves outwards and up, dissipating completely after a few frames.

Any of the Metal Slug Games (except Metal Slug Advance of course  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> )<br />2. Gunforce 2. I really don't know why I like that game so much, but I really do like the explosions. Fun Fact: to make it seem like there are more sprites then there really are, the game actually crams something crazy like 10 64x64 explotions in a 128x128 sprite. (Its basically pre rendered, if that makes scene.) The thing  (128x128 sprite or metasprite) also gets animated for 20+ frames. (Obviously VRAM wasn't an issue...)<br />3. Also, as a bonus, the explosions in DKC 2 and 3 looked nice, but they were a bit small, so I'm not sure if they really belong on the list. The explosions in DKC1 are actually different, and they look really weird to me. They're also surprisingly low colored because they share a palette with the oil drum I think (which makes absolutely no scene, as they're only in Oil Drum Alley and not every level with a TNT barrel Edit: correction, they are also in torchlight trouble (and I call myself a DKC fan  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> )) unlike the ones in DKC2 and 3 that have their own designated color palette.
