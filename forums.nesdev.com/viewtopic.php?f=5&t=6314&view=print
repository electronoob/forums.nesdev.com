		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />"Lots of parallax scrolling without slowdown" for Metal Storm doesn't make much sense either, since it's done with CHR bankswitching, which costs near 0 CPU time. I think the writer doesn't have much knowledge of the architecture of the console, because sometimes he seems to consider trivial things special, maybe because they weren't done often. Still interesting though.

You can do things that are really impressive for a programmer, but a player would just not notice anything special. On the other hand you can do a trick which is very simple but looks amazing. I can't come with exaples right now, but you see what I'm talking about.
<br />
<br />PS:
<br />It still makes me laught when they say "minimal slowdown and flicker" for Gradius games... which are without a doubt the most lagging and flickering games I've ever seen.
<br />
<br />And "heavy doses of rotation effects" in CV3 whene there is just 2 places with rotating pendulums. Okay it is impressive but not what I call a heavy dose.
<br />
<br />It also makes me simle when they say about each game that it is almost a 16-bit game... they sure don't know what they're talking about.

<br />
<br />I agree that this is very well said.
<br />
<br />A while ago I was working on a demo  for the dreamcast.  When I showed some friends they were more impressed with some cheesy smoke effect that took me like 2 seconds to do than anything else.

<br />That largely depends on whether you consider the TG16 to be 16-bit. I will admit that late NES games approached TG16 graphical complexity, but the TG16 is no more 16-bit than the Jaguar is 64-bit. The CPU in the TG16 isn't too different from the one in the NES, just overclocked.

<br />Right I almost forgot since I usually skip that stage. So yeah that's a lot of rotation effects.

You might not have heard about it because Nintendo's subsidiaries in Latin-alphabet markets were engaging in anticompetitive practices against multiplatform developers (and got convicted of such in a United States court). I took the "almost 16-bit" to mean that the visuals approached TG16 quality.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">but a system is 8 bit or 16 bit, it can't be "almost 16 bit" (technically).</div>
<br />The Intellivision CPU can be used as 8-bit, 10-bit, or 16-bit. The TG16 has an 8-bit CPU and a 16-bit video processor. The Sega Genesis and NeoGeo each have a 16-bit data bus, 32-bit registers, a 16-bit VDP, and a separate 8-bit data bus for the Z80 APU. The Super NES has 8-bit data bus, 16-bit registers, 16-bit PPU, and a separate 8-bit data bus for the SPC. The Jaguar has the Genesis CPU, two more 32-bit CPUs, and a flexible blitter with a 64-bit data bus.
<br />
<br />Counting bits is confusing; different components in a system can have different word widths. Is there a definition of "bits" that calls the TG16 16-bit without also calling the Genesis 32-bit?

<br />Damn right. Computer/console makers only used this as a marketing scheme.
<br />
<br />Anyway, by "almost 16-bit" I understand that the games could almost directly compete with the next generation games in terms of graphical quality. Indeed, Return of the Joker is visually amazing, and in my opinion actually looks better than the SNES and Genesis versions.

<br />
<br />He lost his credibility when Shatterhand wasn't on the list.  I mean... the sprites, backgrounds and such were amazing, very nice music, and there was a lot of multi-layered parallax in at least one of the levels (not as impressive as actual parallax as nothing scrolls in front of the background, but visually it looks very good).

<br />
<br />This particular list seems mostly like someone's personal favorite games.  But if we were to try to get more specific, I wonder what we would come up with as pushing the limits.
<br />
<br />I do agree that whether you push the CPU limits or not, some games just plain use their resources better than others.  You can compare games with the same mapper and same data size, and some will just blow everything else out of the water, such as Shatterhand or Moon Crystal.
