Ok, I 100% agree with you, the VRC6 is crazy.<br /><br />I just completely missed those recent findings.<br /><br />EDIT : If the CHR-ROM swapping is the only new feature, then it's definitely not <em>that </em>complex. It is just another form of CHR bank switching, except it affects $2000-$2fff instead of the more normal $0000-$1fff zone. It is not more complicated than TLSROM boards for instance.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Jul 03, 2014 5:28 am</p><hr />

It might be easiest to just take the data from your MMC3 Variants page and put it into separate section(s).<br /><br />P.S. -- I have no idea what &quot;outer banks&quot; refers to in the &quot;Mappers with outer banks&quot; section.  Maybe a little preface/explanation in a paragraph above the table would suffice.  (I took a look at mapper 14 and I guess it's like a &quot;dual-mode mapper&quot; where in one mode it acts like a particular existing mapper, while in another mode it acts like something completely different.

NES-TQROM sounds like I could accomplish what I want with bank switching but is there a mapper that is considering the best when it comes to bank switching?<br /></div><br />There's a <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES" class="postlink">.NES header bit</a>, specifically bit #1 (2nd bit) of &quot;Flags 6&quot;, that has to get turned on to honour use of SRAM.  Otherwise the emulator will very likely not write out a .SAV file, regardless of what you have as your mapper # (the behaviour here will vary per emulator).  If NESASM3 lets you toggle these bits individually, great -- if not then you'll need to edit the ROM every time after assembly to fix it (or find a tool or .bat script that lets you accomplish that).<br /><br />Edit: It looks like Tepples <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=130469#p130469" class="postlink">already said how to do this in NESASM3</a>.  If you want to verify it works, just provide the hexadecimal values of the first 16 bytes of the resulting NES file and we can tell you (or you can read the page I linked and decode it yourself).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Wed Jul 02, 2014 2:51 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I've also made a summary page on the wiki of all the remotely-well-documented mappers here:<br /><a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/User:Lidnariq/MMC3_Variants" class="postlink">nesdevwiki:User:Lidnariq/MMC3 Variants</a><br /><br />I'm happy to move it from a userpage, but don't know where else on the wiki it'd belong instead.<br /></div><br /><br />Sections &quot;MMC3-like mappers with simple banking&quot; and &quot;MMC3-like mappers with outer banks&quot; should probably go into a new page called &quot;MMC3 variants&quot; and that page should be linked to in the main MMC3 page (under References / See also) -- but before doing that, keep reading.<br /><br />Section &quot;Not-particularly-MMC3-like ASIC mappers&quot; and &quot;Discrete logic mappers&quot; I have no idea what to do with.<br /><br />Hrm... honestly what's needed is a table-ised page (a single page, not split across multiple pages) of all the mappers (in order of iNES mapper # and using the sortable table capability so people can sort by field) and all their capabilities/etc. summarised like what you've done throughout all those sections/tables.  Words like &quot;MMC3&quot; in &quot;bank style&quot; need to become links to the MMC3 document/relevant mapper, etc. so that people can cross-reference what's what.  Some of the formatting needs to be made consistent (ex. <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">16 + 16F</tt> vs. <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">16+16F</tt> (note spacing), same for <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">TLSROM,TKSROM</tt> (again spacing)).  The columns &quot;PRG bank size&quot; and &quot;CHR bank size&quot; should also have their unit specified in the column (ex. <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">PRG bank size &#40;kB&#41;</tt>) else they're just arbitrary numbers.<br /><br />Although I'll say this: I have no idea what &quot;F&quot; or &quot;R&quot; means, ex. 16+16F vs. 16F+16 vs. 2+6R, so a legend may be needed as well.<br /><br />For ridiculous mappers that are designed by crazy idiots and consist of 9 billion things intermixed: best to just make a separate page for those mappers (or use the hopefully-existing iNES_Mapper_XXX wiki page) and clarify things there with a single row in the table saying &quot;See {link to thingus}&quot;.<br /><br />The page needs to be clear/concise to people who want a general overview of overall capabilities and not something with insane amounts of detail; what you have in &quot;Comments&quot; works great for a sort of &quot;extra capabilities&quot; line, ex. &quot;Scanline IRQ, expansion audio&quot;, and that shouldn't get too out of control (mapper 5 / MMC5 is a good example of where it gets ridiculous).  For example, I wouldn't want the page to end up looking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_clients" class="postlink">like this clusterfuck on Wikipedia</a> where you totally lose track of where you are + there are multiple tables for multiple things where one program is in one table but not another due to negligence on the part of the editor.  TL;DR -- One mapper per row, one table.  If you want me to start the page + design the existing template/layout, I can do that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Wed Jul 02, 2014 2:44 pm</p><hr />

I have experimented by changing the inesmap value from 0 to 119, still won't allow me to write to $6000. When the time comes, I want to swap out as few tiles as possible when CHR bank switching. NES-TQROM sounds like I could accomplish what I want with bank switching but is there a mapper that is considering the best when it comes to bank switching?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6543">raydempsey</a> — Wed Jul 02, 2014 1:25 pm</p><hr />
