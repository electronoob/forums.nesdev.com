<br />
<br />Clarification #2: it's really easy to design a NEW mapper from 74 series, but it's hard to fit existing mappers. I know, I've spent many many hours trying, and in the end I always add a 16L8 to save 3-5 chips.
<br />
<br />Today it's almost entirely pointless* to go 74 series when small CPLD (~32 registers) can be had for &lt;$1.50 which is enough to fit a MMC1/2/4 or a bootleg FDS hack.
<br />
<br />
<br />*a transparent design may be an advantage depending on purpose of the board

For decoding a couple '139 should do.
<br />
<br />You're looking at US$10 minimum just for the '191 and '670s. $10 can *easily* buy a capable CPLD which will:
<br />-save you money
<br />-save you board space
<br />-save you pins to solder
<br />-allow you to fix design errors
<br />-allow you to try new ideas
<br />-allow you to use existing mapper designs if you wish

<br />What about the rest of the stuff I need in order to work with a CPLD? I don't suppose I could program them with my EPROM programmer? What about software? Not to mention knowledge of the language used to program them, which I have none...
<br />
<br />I'm not exactly against CPLDs, it's just that the discrete chips are much more tangible for me.

<br />
<br />A JTAG cable is all you need, and if your PC has a parallel port you can build a cable easily enough--the only active part in Xilinx and Altera cables is a buffer chip. Or you can buy one for ~$15. Or you can buy a USB JTAG clone for ~$30.
<br />
<br />The major CPLD vendors all have free versions of their design software and AFAIK they also all have schematic capture which is analogous to designing with chips.

<br />Heh, the lack of a working parallel port was the reason I bought my new USB EPROM programmer... =)
<br />
<br />I think the only way I would consider getting into CPLD's was if I didn't have to spend any major $$$. I'll check what my programmer can do and what the hell JTAG is.
<br />
<br />EDIT: My programmer is a Wellon VP-280. Looks like it doesn't support any CPLDs. Bummer.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I recently posted up my new project the "all-in-one" dev cart.  I was originally planning to just make my own version of something similar to the powerpak mostly just for the experience of making the cart.
<br />
<br />My idea contains a CPLD, micro controller and SD card slot.  I'm seriously considering moving the focus of my project towards the issues you guys are having here.  If it was done properly you'd be able to design up your mapper with Xlinix/Altera's IDE which wouldn't be impossible to learn how to do if you already knew your way around programming.  they even have gui so you could litterally "draw" up your mapper with gates and registers if you knew your way around digital design but not a hardware language.
<br />
<br />Then you could just put your file on a SD card and slap it in the cart and have the microcontroller program the CPLD via JTAG.  And bam!  Done deal you have your own easily modified and customizable mapper.  
<br />
<br />The only real limitation it would have is that the capabilities of the CPLD.  Especially for those looking for MMC5 capabilities.  But there are lots of other problems revolving around the MMC5 issue.  First off we don't know as much about it as we'd like making it difficult to reverse engineer and code up ourselves.  But with it being opensource we might be able to team up and redo the MMC5 and upgrade the board to an FGPA.  
<br />
<br />The only real issue I would see is that upgrading the firmware on the microcontroller might not be as simple.  There would have to be access to program it and a programmer available to do the job if you really needed the update.
<br />
<br />It seems like this would be the best solution to what appears to be a fairly large problem.  Would you guys agree?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If somebody is doing something above MMC5, I don't think a $20 chip will even cut it, will it? It'd be something of the PowerPak magnitude with a FPGA on board. I don't think we should let the idea of what could be made make us lose sight on what is probably going to be made. A MMC5 or equivelant cart would cost so much money. You're talking about a $60 cart to make, right? That's not even with profit added in. I don't think its worth thinking that far ahead unless your going to get chips made on a board. I mean, Retro City Rampage even was a NES game at first and was dropped because they wouldn't be able to make the mapper. If bunny wouldn't do a game as great as the RCR demo on MMC5, I don't think anyone should waste their time on it here either. Donor boards would work, but sadly even they aren't very cheap, either. But in the end, donors may be the cheapest option. At least you get a free shell and PCB. No CHR-RAM though, and that SUCKS.

<br />
<br />My thought was more to provide something that would allow someone to easily accomplish some of the things discussed in the post.  A way to add and play around with mapper features while developing a game. 
<br />
<br />I'm kinda ignoring the $20 thing with my idea.  It would have to be closer the the $60 like you were suggesting 3gengames.
<br />
<br />However if someone developed a game with it that made use of the tool, it would be fairly easy and cheap to move the mapper over to a CPLD alone and slap it on a board like the retrozone MMC1.  And the cost of the mapper could easily be under $10.
<br />
<br />But yes MMC5 would be a whole different ball game.   
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Although I think MMC3 with a couple extras would be amazing, too.</div>  This would be the type of thing that I would be looking to incorporate.
<br />
<br />I'm not a game developer though nor do I really plan to be.  But it in the short time I've been following the forum I keep seeing the issue arise and people asking me about how to do something like this.

You get the board, and then you select a list of mapper features and it will output the registers, what the bits do, and then program the chip on the board for those settings, and you go on your merry way. You could have 2 board, the $8 CPLD board. and then the powerful MMC5ish FPGA board to also program with whatever you want with more power if needed. I think everyone would be happy then. If it wasn't so hard deciding on what to add to mapper, there'd be lots of flexibility. But when you just add what you need when you need it, then you don't have to worry about not being able to have the "perfect" mapper for your needs.

<br />
<br />I don't think I follow...
<br />
<br />Are you saying just put the CPLD or FPGA alone on the cart and then just provide a connector to allow for programming the logic?
<br />
<br />If so it seems more complicated and less appealing dealing with your own or a recommended programmer.  Not to mention this would be even more complicated and expensive if you were using an FPGA.
<br />
<br />If I'm understanding what you're saying my setup would be truer to the idea of "COPY-PASTE" via the SD card.
