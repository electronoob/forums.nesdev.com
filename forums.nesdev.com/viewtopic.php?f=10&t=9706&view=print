		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Want to say that you could get a Nintendo-made FC to NES cartridge converter too...  found two so far... walk into a GameStop type store and compare all the NES Gyromite and Stack-Up cartridges... the heavyer ones have Nintendo-made FC to NES cartridge converters... they were created to put a Stack-Up or Gyromite FC cartrige in an nes cause Nintendo had excess amount of FC Gyromite and Stack-Up cartridges.  And these two games were created at the beginning of the nes-era and so can be opened up with a tiny flat-head screwdriver.  Then unscrew the two screws inside... and then pull out and discard the Gyromite or Stack-Up FC cartridge... and pull apart any FC cartridge you could find on ebay and insert it into the converter... heat up the end of a large flat-head screwdriver until it gets a little red, like with a candle, and then carefully slide the center screwhole of the NES cartridge over and then out and away from the inside of the lower NES cartridge case.  Try to do this before heating your screwdriver and remember that you wont be able to touch the end when it's hot.   Give the plastic some time to dry; then rescrew the converter back into the nes cartridge and rescrew the cartridge back together again; don't rescrew the middle screw.  And then play it! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  It is important to clean the two cartridge parts with some Isopropyl Alcohol and some cue-tips.  Before that you could  also clean a lot of the dark marks away with an ink eraser.  I found my Gyromite cartridge converter about two years ago... so I guess all of this is still possible.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well I bought a &quot;Gyromite Adapter&quot; from USA because that was the only sellable thing I could find to play FC games on my NES (there is also chineese adapters but they are sparse today - for some reason they are extremely common for SNES though that's another story).<br /><br />I am very disapointed as how un-useful it is. First, it can mechanically fit in both sides, so you have half chances of messing up and blow everything up (for the truth, nothing will blow up it will just not work). Then is is very hard to actually use it. For front loaders the whole thing is not long enough, so unless your console is opened, you can't use it at all. The Chinese adaters however are made to work with the console, and work very well (they also include CIC defeat circuits - not that I care anyway since I cut pin 4 on all my consoles).<br />For top loaders its not a whole bunch better. You have to open the plastic door manually to have access to the cart slot, and then you should carefully make sure the adapter is properly inserted. Then you can place your game on top of it, but it will be mechanically fragile. Any force applied to the cart, and the PCB of the adapter could probably break down.<br /><br />Then there is the problem that the adapter is a male&lt;-&gt;male adapter, and another female&lt;-&gt;female 60 pin connector will do the joint. The problem is that this connector is always sliding from the adapter and sticking to your games, and this is annoying. Also I had to take my saw and cut some of the plastic from the connector for it to fit into the game's cases.<br /><br />As a conclusion <strong>I really can't recommand the Gyromite adapter, unless you really have no other choices</strong>. I think if I were to do that again I'd rather have imported a Famicom. It would have been more expensive, sure, but at least it would be comfortable and reliable to play FC games and the FDS - and NES-&gt;Famicom adapters are common thanks to famiclones, so it's no problem finding one of those. They might not work with all games because the mirroring pins aren't set up properly but it would be dead easy to fix that in hardware.<br /><br />In fact I think I'll sell my USA toploader, and buy a Famicom to replace it. Unfortunately the console has been modded by me to output AV instead of RF and to have famicom sound - which probably means I'll have to sell for a low price that won't pay my Famicom.<br />I also cat down pieces of plastics on the adapter and added a wire to it for sound so it'll be hard to sell it as a &quot;Gyromite cart with an adapter in it&quot;

Thought someone else might be able to do the same thing. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I also think you could tell the ends of the pins of the FC converters from the normal US games.  But, I remember choosing my cartridge by its weight.  And that is cool to know about the 5 vs 3 <s>pin</s> <span style="color: #FF80BF">screw</span> part... both of my converter carts ha<s>ve</s><span style="color: #FF80BF">d</span> 5 <s>pins</s> <span style="color: #FF80BF">screws</span>. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF80BF">edit.</span>
