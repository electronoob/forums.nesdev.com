<br />
<br />If you wish to vote to have this moved to "General", be my guest.  Honestly, I don't give many fucks.  But to sink your argument, I'd like to say that jargon's posts for the most part IMPEDE NES development.  His "additions" and discussions confuse n00bs and don't contribute anything.  Is this something better for "General" still?  Surely.  My bad.  My bad, bad inconsideration.  
<br />
<br />(Truthfully, it was an act of error and passion that I posted it here instead of General so that it could be seen more.)  If my bullshit can be excused, hopefully it may be.  Otherwise, I see no point in diverting from the significance of this post and how it affects our community.

<br />So since he posts a bunch of garbage, my "argument" that you should post this elsewhere is obliterated?
<br />
<br />And really, it's not a huge deal this was in the wrong forum. I didn't mean to make it sound like that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There are several times where I've found Jargon to be annoying, and a little in-your-face, but you know, I'm surprised I haven't been banned. About a year and a half ago, I had the most annoying posts ever. I read them and I'm honestly really embarrassed. For any of you who know what I'm talking about, and have had do deal with my annoying hyper attitude from then (I don't consider myself to be as annoying anymore, that might be just me), I apologize.
<br />
<br />But some of Jargon's posts are completely useless, such as <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=32728&amp;highlight=#32728" class="postlink">this one</a>. I feel that after making threads about how much people suck, not following board etiquette(Such as refusing to stop double/triple-posting), posting irrelevantly/rudely/drunkly, he should be given <em>one</em> more chance to redeem himself and show some etiquette/respect.
<br />
<br />If he refuses, then perhaps he should be banished.

<br />
<br />I respect your input, but this is indeed what the voting process is about.
<br />
<br />A chance or no chance.
<br />
<br />If giving him a chance is indeed what you wish, don't feel bullied to vote via influence. 
<br />
<br />Cast your opinion.
