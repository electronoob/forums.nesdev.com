<br />
<br />I opened recently a few famicom carts and I always end up with a broken pin or damaged bezel.  I would like to know if any of you have a trick to open them without breaking the bezel.
<br />
<br />There a few board I could contribute to the database but unless I find a way to not break them... I will never be able to do it.
<br />
<br />Any trick that doesn't require a saw or a axe will be more than appreciated.  Microwave doesn't count too.

<br />Seriously though, why can't you just unscrew them and take it apart? They had to have put it together somehow that can be done in reverse.

<br />
<br />(Getting way off topic here...)
<br />
<br />The first two statements are not correct.
<br />
<br />Any polar molecule should vibrate in a microwave oven (and thus heat).
<br />
<br />Try microwaving anhydrous ammonium nitrate <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />And melting water is a neat trick <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I would not attempt to microwave any electronics.  Not only will the corona discharge probably fry the thing from external voltage surges jumping across the pins of the chips, but the inner silicon circuit would probably heat (unevenly) and crack.
<br />
<br />Try this:  Place a plastic cup in the microwave, open side up.  On top of that lay a cdrom.  Nuke for 10 seconds.  Notice that most of the cracks in the CD are ~1.2 cm apart.  Now consider that a microwave oven's peak frequency is around 2.45 GHz....  A voltage will build up on the surface of the CD and short itself out every 12 mm or so (internal thin aluminum surface), producing the neat pattern.
<br />
<br />I'm pretty sure that there is NO water inside the CD when this occurs, btw.
<br />
<br />Now, for another trick... remove the magnetron from a microwave oven.  Attach (via home-made mounting bracket) to the outside of a Dish-TV type satellite TV receiver, right at the focal point.  Aim the magnetron toward the dish.  You now have a 800 W directed energy weapon.  Too bad the beam attenuates in the air (due mostly to water vapor) within a few feet <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />
<br />Anyway I have no microwave at home so too badly I can't try those tricks.

<br />Damn.  I didn't think of this first. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />Bregalad, after my post I read the wikipedia article on Microwave ovens.  Pretty interesting.  Anyway...
<br />
<br />
<br />I did not know that Famicon carts were so different from NES carts, other then the connector pin count.  Can anyone post pictures of a close-up of how the two halves of the case are fastened to each other (the original intent of this post I assume)?

<br />Actually a Microwave oven uses Microwave radiation to create vibration within the particles. The vibrating particles will result in friction. After that, heat will occur. That's why it cooks your food.
<br />Also those things aren't that great anyway. They will cook out some minerals. 
<br />I have a cool experiment. 
<br />Microwave some water. 
<br />Have some non microwaved water. 
<br />Try watering a seed with microwaved water just as much as a seed with regular water. (Better if it's not city water but from a well. Cities tend to put chlorine in water.) Then after some time you will see the subject will do worse than the control.
<br />
<br />Also if you put a game cart or something similar into the microwave  oven. It'll totally fry the IC's.
<br />
<br />
<br />Edit: Shit! CLueless beat me to the punch.

<br />
<br />
<br />Cook out the minerals?  Um, nope.  Microwave radiation is neither ionizing nor oxidizing.  It should not chemically change any minerals.  It should only "change" them if it heats them up really hot.  And that should never happen.  As the food cooks its temperature should not get significantly above the boiling temperature of water.  It can't as that energy would be absorbed by the water and cause it to boil (same principle as the double-boiler, used to melt chocolate).
<br />
<br />What minerals (found in food or potable fluids, and in typical quantities) are you suggesting that a microwave oven would somehow chemically alter?

<br />Okay I should have not posted this. Since I don't have any proof to back it up. I should have posted it is a theory based on the experiment.
<br />I know saying crap like "I've heard it does this" Is not proof. 
<br />Sorry I failed to post the theories 'n' stuff. I meant to.
<br />I'll just leave the post the way it is. I don't need to cover stuff up. I don't wanna be like Dutch-Win with his 
<br /><a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4472" class="postlink">pirate cart I found</a> Thread. 
<br />All I know Is the experiment works with noticeable effects. 
<br />I didn't mean to get this deep into the discussion of electromagnetic waves 'n' crap.
<br />I say "Let's just get back on subject.". So let's do that.[/url]

<br />Like mentioned above, most of them don't.  If you want to see how the bevel looks like, you can always check bootgod's website witch contains many of them <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/" class="postlink">here</a>

<br />
<br />Can you heat one side of the cart with something "warm", and the other side with something cold (dry ice) (or sandwich the cart between two peltier devices appropriately configured)?  Then the plastic might warp (but not break) such that it is easier to pry apart?  Assuming, of course, that you heat the side that needs to flex, so that it doesn't get too brittle via the cold.  The cold side should contract slightly and the warm side expand.  Probably less than 1 mm though.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />Kind ok like using the trick of holding a glass "Mason" jar under hot running water to cause the metal lid to expand slightly so that it is easier to open.  The metal expands faster than the glass (different heat transfer coefficients).

<br />Your trick seems interesting but since it's plastic, I don't know how much chance you would have to damage the bezel in the process and maybe the cart inside.
<br />
<br />When it's a 1$ cart, I would not mind to try it but for the more expensive one like Top secret, I would not even think about it.
<br />
<br />Maybe I should try first with the bunch of baseball cart rotting in the junk bin at 50 yen.
