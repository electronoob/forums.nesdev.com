Remember: Nintendo can "pull a Nesticle" and patch the games rather than fix/improve the emulator, if that's a cheaper approach. They aren't aiming to emulate the NES; they want to emulate <em>specific</em> games. This is much less stringent than modern NES emulators which attempt to emulate NES hardware and (among other things) play the original unmodified game machine code and data.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sat Jun 10, 2006 10:38 pm</p><hr />

* Nintendo has full authoritative NES documentation and likely many of the original programmers who knew the machine intimately.<br />* As tepples said, they only have to support the games they release. Further, they can modify the game to be easier to emulate, rather than having to make the emulator bend over backwards to accommodate a picky game.<br />* Their emulator only has to work on a single platform with plenty of performance, and its processor architecture (PowerPC) makes asm coding virtually unnecessary.<br />* They have professional programmers who are much better than most of us at designing and planning an emulator.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Thu Jun 08, 2006 7:27 pm</p><hr />

I just thought about this - forgive me if its been brought up before. I mean, Nintendo is going to make a virtual console which is going to play NES, SNES, GB, N64, SEGA, and arcade games. Doesn't that like...suck? I mean think of all those emulators they have to make. Having made an NES and GB emulator that's far from perfect, I know how difficult it can be. Is it that much easier to make emulators for dedicated consoles? Is having access to direct tech specs gonna make it a piece of cake? Maybe they only care about getting specific games working, but I know some NES games are a PAIN to get right without some crazy detail.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=50">laughy</a> — Thu Jun 08, 2006 4:06 pm</p><hr />
