		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I took my CopyNES out of storage to try to see if I could dump some Famicom and NES cartridges with it. Unfortunately, when I use the Test function in Bootgod's software, it can't establish communication. I did have the CopyNES turned on during the test, and I am using the original DB-25 cable provided by Kevin. I tried all four parallel port settings in the BIOS (SPP, EPP, ECP, EPP+ECP) and none of them worked. What is the next step in troubleshooting?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That sucks to hear :/ My CopyNES has started to act a little flakey the past couple weeks as well. What seems to fix it for me is re-seating the copynes board or just playing with it. If you have the top off, you can get your fingers underneath the copynes board and play with it a little.
<br />
<br />The DB-25 cable can be fussy too, try and make sure it doesn't run along with other cords, it must be a shielding issue. This usually won't cause it to stop working completely though, more so it just causes random stalls during dumping.
<br />
<br />Did your unit work before you put it in storage? If so, are you using it with the same PC as before?
<br />
<br />Also, from what I've heard (and I had one like this as well), the port chip (6522 i think) has been DOA. If you happen to have a C64 disk drive around, you could pull one out and try replacing the copnes one with it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had some trouble with it before it was packed away, but I wrote that off to problems with the DOS client. No, I haven't used it on this computer before.
<br />
<br />I opened the case and checked the ribbon cable going from the board to the DB-25 connector; it seemed solid. Getting to the board itself would require removing the cartridge connector. (Incidentally, I replaced that with a new MCM connector right before having it modded, so there shouldn't be any problems on that front.)
<br />
<br />I have no idea why the 6522 would have blown out. I suppose if it was that, I could pull one from a 1541 floppy drive, or just buy one on-line for a couple of bucks. Is it socketed, though? I don't really feel like doing soldering on the board.

<br />
<br />Do you happen the know the motherboard model in your PC?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't recall the exact model (and the original packaging is buried somewhere or thrown away), but I do know that my motherboard has a SiS 648 chipset. The parallel port is part of the "Super I/O" section of that chipset, according to the BIOS, which I think is pretty standard for modern boards (no one uses discrete components any more for this). It's running a Pentium 4 Willamette 1.8GHz @ 2.4GHz.
