		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello everyone, I'm still alive.<br /><br />So on New Years Day 2015 I challenged myself to code 12 SNES demos in 12 months for the <a href="http://www.onegameamonth.com" class="postlink">One Game Per Month</a> Challenge.<br /><br />So far I have finished two games:<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/undisbeliever/elevator-madness-dx/releases/tag/version-02" class="postlink">Elevator Madness DX</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/undisbeliever/first-person-tetromones/releases/tag/1gam" class="postlink">First Person Tetromones</a> (a clone of First Person Tetris)</li></ul><br />However they haven't been tested on real hardware. I don't have any way to testing them atm.<br /><br />I'm not 100% sure if First Person Tetromones will actually work on real hardware. There were a few bugs which caused the controller to stop working and the screen to cut out half way on snes9x, which worked fine on BizHawk 1.91 (bsnes v0.87 compatibility). But those went way after I added a Palette buffer AFTER setting the Mode 7 Matrix for some reason.<br /><br />On higen v0.94-accuracy-64bit windows the game is rendered upside down for some reason. It works fine on the balanced/performance build so again, not sure what's happening.<br /><br />Can anyone please test these two games and let me know what you think of them. Also any comments on the actual games would be wonderful, my brother hasn't been bothered to test them yet.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Welcome back undisbeliever!<br /><br />For Elevator Madness DX, you press Start to play the game.<br /><br />I can't test these games on real hardware. I have an actual SNES, but no cart capable of playing custom programs. I'm still glad to play with them via emulator, even if briefly.<br /><br />I have successfully made real SNES music for almost half a decade now (since 2009, actually... and I've been using a compiled version of mukunda's SNESMod since 2011!). My G5 is retired due to hardware failure, so I have an Intel Mac running Mac OS X 10.6.8.<br /><br />I've even been successfully converting some SNES RPG music from the SNESDev.net forums after doing some optimizations for the samples (and/or replacing them due to my changed ethics on which ones to use... although that's not always possible)! I fully intend on making a new sound driver so I can make the music interactive and be able to swap out data on the fly for the songs that are either too big to be practical in their original form due to combined sample size... or in one case, way too large period due to the sheer number of patterns I used (it's also interactive). I've even decided to make new tracks in the original style and then perform my optimizations (that's because the originals are now my master-quality samples).<br /><br />These days, though, I'm in college, so I can't guarantee a soundtrack every month (well, I <em>could</em> do one track per game, but again, I can't guarantee that...). My schedule becomes more free starting mid-May (although in this case, it may only be brief... normally summers are open).<br /><br />I have gained the ability to look up code in hexadecimal, though, using a hex editor. I've gotten very good at this because I invent music modifiers, and I do so with no debugger needed. This includes manipulating/looking up pointers (both on the SNES and SPC700 end), and reverse-engineering music data (again, both on SNES and SPC700 end, since some games send note data from the SNES side to the SPC700).

It works fine in Bizhawk.  I'm really curious how you programmed joypad input; unless it only has problems on certain console models this should be filed as a bug report against the emulator...

Just tried the new version and I still can't start the game.<br /><br />I do feel like I remember reading somewhere about the auto joypad read timing not being emulated properly, now that I think about it.  Are you sure your vBlank takes enough time?  That's the only idea I've got...<br /><br />EDIT:  Saving a piece is simple.  You have a slot that's initially empty that you can press a button to send a piece to, and from then on press the same button to swap the current piece with the one in the slot.  Generally speaking the piece will restart from the top again when swapped out, and therefore you only get to swap once per piece set down.

The same is true of pressing and holding L during line clear delay.</div><br /><br />I'm not completely sure I have this bit right. It works during line clear animation, but its occasionally hit or miss on a normal lockdown. The timing window (12 frames) seams a little short, I've tried higher values but then it ruins the game-play experience for me. What do you guys think?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">ThunderZ wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Sorry, i try it with my pal SNES (original PAL + switched one (NTSC/PAL) with my linker a SUPER UFO PRO 8.<br /><br />Your original demo won't load on the linker, i don't make a deeper check of your SNES Header.<br />I try the same correct i make for some personal project.<br />Because i'm just starting the SNES dev since 2 weeks now.<br />but I think you setup of you SNES rom isn't &quot;correct&quot;.<br /></div><br /><br />I have no idea, I'm <em>guessing</em> that I didn't update the SNES checksum in those releases. I went over all the values again and couldn't find anything obvious. I spent about an hour last year going over the SNES dev manual trying to build that header correctly.<br /><br />Thankyou for reminding me about ucon64. I've modified my Makefiles to use ucon64 to set the checksum as ca64 doesn't do it for me.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">KungFuFurby wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Welcome back undisbeliever!<br /><br />...<br /><br />I fully intend on making a new sound driver so I can make the music interactive and be able to swap out data on the fly for the songs that are either too big to be practical in their original form due to combined sample size... or in one case, way too large period due to the sheer number of patterns I used (it's also interactive). I've even decided to make new tracks in the original style and then perform my optimizations (that's because the originals are now my master-quality samples).<br /></div><br /><br />It's good to be back. I've haven't been social on the net for a while. This 1 game a month challenge should bring me out of it.<br /><br />I've decided to just ignore sound for the moment. I'm going to wait a few months and see if anyone develops a sound driver that suits my needs (easy to use, supports sound effects, work in both an emulator and a real SNES) before tackling that challenge.<br /><br />March's release is going to be a jump across falling platforms demo. It will involve me finishing my MetaSprite engine, creating an initial game loop and handling bounding box collisions.
