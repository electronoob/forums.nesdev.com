		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello all, I've been lurking around for a bit as I'm writing an NES emulator (don't worry, i don't plan on releasing it.  there's enough bad NES emulators out there as it is  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />.  just a bit of a mental exercise).  
<br />Anywho, do any of you have any word of advice at the general creation of an nes emulator.  ie. this is something I wasted my time on.  This took a while but ended up being really cool.  Kind of stuff that would go in a postmortem.  Thanks in advance.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Be ready for rewrites. I had to rewirte my PPU code 4 times before I got it the way I wanted it. 
<br />
<br />Compile a list of docs from as many places as possible and keep them in one place. If you find something that is explained well in one doc make note of it. 
<br />
<br />I would keep everything in C/C++, compilers nowdays can optimize stuff to the point that you will not see a big diff in performance. Unless you are on a P2 600MHz
<br />
<br />I would start with the 6502 core and then move to the PPU and then do some mappers. I managed to get my 6502 core working pretty quickly (less then two weekends). And then the PPU took a little longer and the mappers are taking a little longer. (I don't want to talk about the apu right now  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /> )
<br />
<br />Do not be afriad to ask question.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I wrote a simple (unreleased) NES emulator a while back and it was fun. I intentionally wrote it very simply so it only plays a few MMC1 games and doesn't even handle a fixed status display at the top (it scrolls with the main screen). It was a good learning experience and I still occasionally experiment with features. If you want new ideas, you could focus on specializing it for a particular game then adding extensions, like graphics with more colors.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My Advice:
<br />
<br />- Write the CPU core first
<br />- Start with basic roms (no mapper) and no scrolling games (popeye, king kong, etc)
<br />- When you see a crash in the cpu, fix it
<br />- Make a simple ppu engine (just to show the screen)
<br />- Its not a bad idea to emulate input, so you can run nestress and check your cpu core.
<br />- dont worry at first for IRQ, worry about NMI
<br />- if you want to run it in WIN32. Use directdraw for output, GDI is slower
<br />- Ask in this forum if you have a problem.
