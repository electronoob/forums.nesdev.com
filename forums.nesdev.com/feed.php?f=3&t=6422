That's actually a useful one, as it directly targets what you might want to avoid, graphical junk due to the emulator, that would get blamed on your game. The CPU can "see" quite a bit via a sprite #0 with a single non-transparent pixel. With the palette all black, the player need not see any visual glitches while you verify that you aren't running on a sub-par emulator.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sun May 30, 2010 1:07 pm</p><hr />

How to detect almost any SNES emulator:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">sed<br />lda #$9a<br />sbc #$01<br />bv? emulatorDetected</div><br /><br />I don't recall off the top of my head what the V flag should be, unfortunately. The truth is, the SNES emulation scene is still in the NESticle phase.<br /><br />Detecting emulators via blargg's approach (eg not name and shame) can be useful. Especially if you use the behavior you're testing.<br /><br />I also don't think that testing an unrelated behavior to block your game is all that useful. d4s added an emulator check using hardware mul/div delays, and nobody touched it for a few years. It was blargg that ended up cracking it, and I'm not sure he even knows about that game. I only asked him to help because I felt bad for putting it off for so long. That sort of thing requires a really competitive environment to work.<br /><br />ZSNES v Snes9X in the 90s would be a good example of that environment. Nestopia vs RockNES would not be. It is hard to pressure someone to improve when they have more than ten times your market share.<br /><br />Not worrying about emulators that can't support it isn't a good approach. I've had two people accuse me of intentionally making one of my translations not work on ZSNES just to get people to use my emulator. The hole in that logic was that the original Japanese game didn't work either. I kind of wish I did add such a check in retrospect, as the game is still broken, 14 years after reporting the bug. It's not those two reports that bug me, it's the dozens of false bug reports to this day that do.<br /><br />Also, neviksti's Star Ocean patch? I understand you like to point out any exception to a rule, but come on :P<br />That has all of nothing to do with emulator detection anymore.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Sat May 29, 2010 11:21 am</p><hr />

I think tepples' approach is to solve the issue of random ignorant user claiming a game sucks because it doesn't work on his favorite emulator. If the game had a screen at the beginning, "Note: this game is made for a genuine NES, and may not work in clones or emulators.", said person might be less-apt to claim it's the game's fault.<br /><br />And you wouldn't need to do emulator version identification, since you aren't actually detecting the emulator, rather something that behaves differently than on a NES. If the emulator later became perfect, then by definition there's no way the game could detect it and put up any kind of warning. Emulators aren't perfect, but neither can a game detect every possible deviance from NES behavior. If a good number of homebrew games put up warnings like this, there would be incentive for emulator authors to fix the inaccuracies said games exploit to detect them, resulting in a sort of arms race whose end-state would be perfect emulators. It's an interesting approach.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sat May 29, 2010 9:00 am</p><hr />

Now you got me. Most problems I found with FCEU(X)(D) were reletaed to graphics. I seem to remember it not emulating the sprite pattern fetching during HBlank well. Maybe a timed change of sprite patterns (through bankswitching or a $2000 write) followed by a sprite 0 hit could be used.<br /><br />I don't remember the problem exactly, but back when I was trying to switch out a bank with empty tiles for one with the tiles I'd use during the frame, depending on where in HBlank the switch was made, Nintendulator, Nestopia and my NES would display some of the sprites in the following scanline with transparent patterns (the ones that were fetched before the switch), but FCEUXD would never do that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri May 28, 2010 12:35 pm</p><hr />
