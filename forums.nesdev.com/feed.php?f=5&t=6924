The ps3 is hardly the most powerful game system ever made. Power means precisely dick if it isn't practical to use.<br /><br />The issue with varied PC specs is mostly a question of how much you can stand limiting your audience, and how much you're willing to pay to provide tech support.<br /><br />Modern consoles have fixed specs for all the parts that actually matter, which'd be the controllers, CPU specs, system software, and GPU. Compatability issues on the PC are almost entirely a matter of GPU mismatches, graphics or sound driver issues, and order of magnitude differences in CPU/GPU capability between the top end and the onboard Intel IGP end.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8">ReaperSMS</a> — Thu Sep 02, 2010 5:21 pm</p><hr />

It took two copies (not a big deal since they were 8 bucks) and testing on a friend's N64 to find that out.  It's not like you can easily swap expansion and jumper paks, either.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3506">strat</a> — Thu Sep 02, 2010 2:17 pm</p><hr />
