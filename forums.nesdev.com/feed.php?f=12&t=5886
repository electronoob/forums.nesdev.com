So FeRAM has a finite number of writes or both reads and writes since reads destroy the data held and it must be rewritten? How many reads/writes is the expected life time on them? It's a shame there is a limit at all. That's always bothered me about Flash memory too.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Wed Dec 30, 2009 12:03 pm</p><hr />

In Pokemon, there's a place early in the game where an old man teaches you how to catch pokemon using pokeballs.<br />The game copies your name to an area in memory used for storing which pokemon appear, then temporarily changes your name to OLD MAN to run the cutscene.  Then it restores your name.<br /><br />Normally, the area in memory for storing which pokemon appear is replaced as soon as you stop on grass.  However, there are some places where it is possible to get into fights without that data getting replaced.  So suddenly, you get into fights with glitch pokemon that don't exist, like MissingNo.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Wed Dec 30, 2009 7:46 am</p><hr />

With some buffering after the CE signal, I connected an access light LED, and in some cases an audible logic probe. Playing different games, I noticed that they are in general very well behaved about accessing the battery RAM (Again, the fear was that it would be reading constantly from the battery RAM, and wear it out like nothing).<br /><br /><br />Some specifics:<br /><br />F-Zero just generally reads everything at the beginning, and doesn't touch it unless you place in the rankings in time trial mode, and it's a tiny little write.<br /><br />Zelda LTTP is kind of weird, in that on the title and file select screen, it keeps reading from the memory, but in short bursts with plenty of time in-between. Once the actual game gets going it does something even more interesting: every time your character's name is mentioned, it reads it directly from the save ram. It's funny how they were either lazy or went to the trouble to save a few bytes of system ram.<br /><br />SimCity works just like you'd expect. Nothing goes on at all, except a little check at the beginning, and activity only when SAVE or LOAD is selected. Or with the "fax" when you win a scenario which is understandable.<br /><br />Final Fight Guy HATES having any sort of save-ram in the memory map. I'm almost halfway interested in what it is actually writing to the chip. Are there any other smallish sized games that care about the RAM being in the memory map? I haven't come across many others.<br /><br />I just really like the concept of having the game save act normally, and having it accident proof. What I'm saying is that I don't like the concept of trying to constantly dump to SD or CF Card either.<br /><br />My other question is, is if anyone knows if there are any non-special chip commercial game releases (not translation patches) that treat the battery RAM area as a scratchpad memory, that as a result is constantly being changed? I can't see use like that being much of an advantage, so it's probably rare.<br /><br />Anyways, I can probably put up some grainy pictures of my rat's-nest SD programmable cart in a day or two.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4151">whicker</a> — Wed Dec 30, 2009 2:47 am</p><hr />

....After months of use and abuse, I can report that it actually works without issue, but requires glue logic.<br /><br />Okay, let's back up a second, what am I talking about?<br /><br />No doubt the backup battery in some of your SNES cartridges have gone dead, not allowing your saves to last beyond power off, or, in some cases, the game refuses to run at all.<br /><br />Obviously encountering this myself, I thought to look up any sort of nonvolatile memory that acts somewhat like the SRAM chips (probably in about 2004). I gave up the first time because I realized the 5V FeRAM series of chips could never be a drop-in replacement because of the need to strobe the Chip Select signal. So I kind of gave up then and there...<br /><br />Earlier this year, I renewed my interest in the SNES console and in making some sort of programmable cartridge for my own use. At this point I had a deep hatred for coin cell batteries. So I figured, what the hell, go for it, and use the Ramtron FM1808 32KB chip.<br /><br />The trick is that since the memory performs destructive read and writeback, it needs a more organized bus access than purely asynchronous like SRAM does. The falling edge of Chip Select latches the address, and then either a read or write can be performed. Or, you can have it set up for a read or write, and then drop chip select (That second way is what ends up working for me on my board).<br /><br />Attached in the next post is a simplified schematic of a 8 meg flash chip, the F-RAM, and a functional logic gate configuration set up for LoROM. I don't actually have those switches, but I guess I'm drawing it this way to show conceptually how to map to the different sizes of battery RAM.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4151">whicker</a> — Wed Dec 30, 2009 2:21 am</p><hr />
