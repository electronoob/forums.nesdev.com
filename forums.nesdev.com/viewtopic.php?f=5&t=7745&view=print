It seems like a very cool idea for a game, but it is implemented terribly. Anyone have a suggestion for a game similar to Strider that doesn't suck taint?

<br />
<br />-Batman has a better wall jump feature
<br />-Mega Man series (of course)
<br />-Code Name: Viper (also by Capcom) was released near the same time &amp; shares similar sound effects
<br />-Batman: Return of the Joker, although does away with the wall jump ability, it implements sliding
<br />-Ninja Gaiden (sword slashing/wall-clinging)
<br />
<br />Honestly, though, Strider isn't that bad of a game.  It's very playable &amp; not too difficult.  I would consult a guide just to make sure I wouldn't miss anything (like when I missed the pair of boots in Africa <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" /> ).

Sadly that is still a common problem with modern games <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Thanks for the suggestions. I'll give Viper a try. I know where I can get a cart cheap if I like it.
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />LOLZ!!! I just looked ad Code Name: Viper and in the opening scene dude's gots no pants on! LOL! I know they are supposed to be tan fatigues, but they use the same color for his flesh <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

The game isn't bad (possibly even better than the arcade version in terms of gameplay, many people may disagree  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> ), but could use a lot of polish. Wall jumps in particular, sucks badly.
<br />
<br />Any game in the Wond... errr... Monster World/Monster Land (and versions to other platforms, which were disguised with many other names for some reasons) series are also similar in gameplay (considering the "action-adventure" aspects) I think.

<br />I have been sick for five days now with a severe sinus infection and I've been having crazy fever dreams about a side-scrolling NES game where the main character has a crazy big "whoosh" kinda sword, like the one in Strider.
<br />
<br />I have been trying to find some inspiration, but all I've been able to find are examples of what not to do <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />
<br />This ordeal (Rolling Thunder vs. Code Name: Viper) has bothered me since I was a kid.  The similarities are excessive, including the fact that the main character in Rolling Thunder (Japanese release) had a code name of "Albatross".  The music, style, animation, EVERYTHING is too similar.  If done today, Namco/Atari would almost certainly sue.
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Thunder_%28arcade_game%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Th ... de_game%29</a><!-- m -->
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Name:_Viper">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Name:_Viper</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />I'm left wondering if old Namco employees didn't end up working at Capcom or something.  Seriously.
<br />
<br />One thing worth noting however is that Rolling Thunder is called "Rolling Thunder" in Japan, while Code Name: Viper is called "Dead Fox: Human Weapon".
<br />
<br />I've finished Code Name: Viper many times but I've never finished Rolling Thunder.  It would be worth comparing credits from both games to see if there are any identical names.  If not, maybe the dudes at Capcom just really liked Namco's original arcade game.  They do shit like that in Japan.  Here, we just create <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bionic_Commando_Rearmed" class="postlink">absolutely horrible remakes</a> of classic games.  Oh wait, GRIN is Swedish -- now it all makes sense.  Fafan... jävla helvete!

<br />
<br />Which is a really good game, unlike Strider. There are 2 criticisms I have of NG3: one is that they didn't create a song for each stage, so they recycle music throughout the game. The other is the uneven difficulty level. You can just breeze through most of the game, but then you reach level 7 and the ass-handing begins..
