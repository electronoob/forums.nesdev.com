		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think LCD TVs will eventually be tolerable enough for retro gaming. My HDTV has mutliple different picture settings I can switch between. In nearly all of them, I've turned the backlight intensity down because <em>holy shit</em>, but on the one I reserve for retro consoles, I have the backlight intensity turned all the way up, but the brightness turned down. The reasoning behind this was because I saw the colors clipping when I adjusted the brightness and contrast settings, so I adjusted the brightness and contrast until the colors weren't clipping anymore, and I turned up the backlight intensity to compensate for the darker palette. It wasn't perfect because the TV I'm used to uses a modified FCC standard, but LCDs tend to use the sRGB standard, but it was close enough to call it a day.<br /><br />As for the future of retro gaming, I believe the answer is with the development of a CRT emulator that you plug your console into, which simulates a CRT genlocking and positioning, with its output being in 1080p. Kinda like if you were to rip the guts out of an old CRT television, and have the circuit board logic driving raw RGB outputs or something. (Buffered so you can repeat the scanline 4-5 times for upscaling)<br /><br />Anyone developing this idea is sure to earn a buck or two. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

But as stands, the missing pixel means the sampling PLL in the TV can't ever get a lock.<br /><br />The fix is straightforward, albeit invasive—intercept the system clock, detect when the PPU's data bus <em>fails</em> to go idle for the the sometimes-missing pixel, and then deliberately conceal four master clock cycles from the PPU.

With less and less devices outputting analog video, there's absolutely no motivation for TV manufacturers to improve support for it.

However, the TV I'm feeding it a signal to will drop frames every now and then as you've mentioned. My LCD monitor, which takes VGA, doesn't do this, and does a correct job. My test of this is some Neo-Geo games that use flickering transparency for shadows. Every ~second or so the shadow is either doubled or skipped for one frame. The PC monitor doesn't do it, though.<br /><br />I'm sure some TVs that take VGA won't have that issue, and maybe some through HDMI. It will be dependent on implementation of the set, I suppose.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, pretty much that's the issue I was talking about. The idea was to have the upscaler do the frame dropping though just in case a TV goes bonkers with the non-standard refresh rate.<br /><br />For the record, PC monitors may be better for this, since they don't expect a very specific refresh rate. In fact Nvidia is working on a technology where the refresh rate is variable (i.e. data is not sent unless the screen changes), monitors supporting that would be probably ideal for this purpose since they'd be designed to take anything (within a certain wide margin at least). As a bonus you get better picture quality than a TV.

It does two frames at once because it's 480i displayed at 30hz.<br /><br />I tried the composite-into-component trick and the component input still says 480i, so, I guess that's not an option for me. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Maybe someday when I have a job again I'll splurge on one of those $300 Japanese upscaling machines...
