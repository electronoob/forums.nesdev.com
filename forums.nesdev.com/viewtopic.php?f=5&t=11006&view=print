		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've read about a console and they said that its later versions used inferior hardware and that you'd better look for one of the older versions when you want to buy one.<br /><br />Is something like that also the case for the NES or the Super Nintendo? Are specific revisions better than others?<br /><br />I only own one NES, but I'm pretty sure many people here have seen and inspected more than one. So, are there versions that give a better or worse image than the other ones? Or where the sound isn't that clear anymore while other revisions have a clear sound? Or is the gaming experience indistinguishable?<br /><br />I'm not talking about obvious alternate versions like the top loader NES vs. the normal one. Nor am I talking about the various locations (Japan, USA, Europe). I'm only talking about the standard American front loader NES and the standard American Super Nintendo: If I buy one of these, should I pay attention to get one that was, for example, produced in 1985 because it is better than one that was produced in 1991? Or is there no difference for the player?<br /><br />Besides, I'm not talking about the lockout chip or any anti-cracking mechanisms either. I know that they got stricter in the newer consoles. My question only refers to all those things like graphics, sound, controller input and the general compatibility of regular games: Does a specific revision has poorer graphics, poorer sound, poorer response to controller inputs or any incompatibility to a specific (licensed) game that another revision of the same console doesn't have?

Nothing before the -04 is known.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Alright, so I assume the same is true for the quality of the composite plugs, so that the picture and sound is identical as well, right? (I.e. from the non-motherboard perspective, since graphics and sounds could vary even with the same motherboard, simply by using inferior material for the plugs.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There are noticeable CPU behavior differences between launch Super NES consoles (version 1/1/1) and later consoles (the more common version 2/1/3). Using all the DMA channels could freeze a 1/1/1, so games like Uniracers reportedly use only 7 of 8 DMA channels when they detect a 1/1/1. The 1-chip revision (last before the SNES Jr.) is said to have <a href="http://retrorgb.com/1chipsnes.html" class="postlink">better video, especially for RGB or component mods</a>.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I realize you said &quot;front-loader only&quot;, so maybe you already knew or it's irrelevant.  But there actually was a later revision of the top-loader that had A/V out.  It used the same custom A/V connector as the SNES.  Supposedly the video quality is better than the normal top-loader, I haven't seen one myself (could just be A/V versus RF looking better).  Back in the 90's (or early 00's?) I'd heard of at least a couple cases where someone had sent their NES to Nintendo for service, and received that revision in exchange.

The 1CHIP-03 is known to be the best of the three 1CHIP revisions. <br /><br />Basically, the exact last SNES (non-mini) revision. Odd, considering usually the first batches of a console are higher quality or most featureful.
