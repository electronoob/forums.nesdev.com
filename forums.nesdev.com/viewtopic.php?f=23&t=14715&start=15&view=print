Screenshot is attached.  Windows actually provides a way to do this, if I remember right, by basically giving you a piece of memory that represents the console screen/buffer and you're forced to do all the rest yourself.<br /><br />So is this thread about understanding old PC graphics and text modes, or is it about trying to implement them or use them on present-day PCs (really not feasible) while in Windows?

If you want a bigger challenge then just do it in x86 assembler! Basic x86 is not so bad, just the segmented memory can be a pain at the beginning.  You can even write some assembler code inside turbo C 3.0 if you want (and some version of turbo pascal allowed too my memory is good).

I consider this a serious deffect of the OS and I am seriously considering rolling back to XP just to be able to use fullscreen applications natively again. Since I'll be using an OS considered extremely outdated and obsolete anyway, I might as well using one which offers me the features I need. Any Windows more recent than 7 is out of the question because their GUI is retarded and that's another topic.<br /><br />Developing new applications which requires DOSBox do not sound like a great idea to me. It'd feel like programming a NES game intended to be run in Nesticle.<br /><br />I guess I'm stuck using ncurses and the default character set, and use it to create my graphics.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Have you tried making your own monospaced TrueType font in FontForge and using regedit to add the font to Windows Command Prompt?<br /></div><br />I of course cannot ask users to take all those step themselves before using my program, and this is a Windows-only solution.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Just because the older stuff is supported through the boot process doesn't mean it's supported once the multitasking, multiuser operating system has taken over.</div><br />But it'd be extremely impractical to write a program which is designed to be booted into.

You'll need to make your own font for this though (I think this can be installed/uninstalled or utilised somehow during runtime vs. the user having to install it manually).<br /><br />If what you're wanting is &quot;real-time character/glyph changing&quot;, like the ability on classic PCs in MS-DOS to manipulate the BIOS font used, I don't think that's possible.  In that situation, you'd need to resort to using something like DirectX and doing everything yourself; yeah, not fun.

Basically it'd be a music player/editor using semi-graphical things in a terminal, just exactly like what you screenshoted. So far I have only written pure command line programs (takes text and files as input, text and files as output, nothing semi-graphical), and graphical program on dedicated platform like the NES and other video game consoles. I know squat about how a graphical program for a computer works internally and I don't really care now. However it sounds like both Microsoft and Linux forces people interested in writing semi-graphical programs in going fully graphical and do not promote hybrid programs using an interactive command line and/or graphics in a terminal (or whatever the equivalent is named in windows - since Koitsu claims cmd.exe is not a terminal and adds a nasty ominous statement that this should not be discussed).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Ha ha ha, but making a &quot;boot disk&quot; just to run one game that's already installed on your hard drive was definitely part of the authentic DOS experience. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div><br />I completely forgot about it until you mentioned it, but I think one of my favourite games when I was about 10 required me to boot on floopy #1 and then to insert floppy #2 to run the game. I'm not entirely sure how it worked, but it was something like that.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If what you're wanting is &quot;real-time character/glyph changing&quot;, like the ability on classic PCs in MS-DOS to manipulate the BIOS font used, I don't think that's possible. In that situation, you'd need to resort to using something like DirectX and doing everything yourself; yeah, not fun. Maybe SDL or Allegro has support to make this kind of thing a lot easier (but the app will no longer be a Win32 console app and won't use the Win32 console).</div><br />Well, the best would be full real time character changing like CHR-RAM on the NES, the second best would be to come up with any custom character set I like and not be able to change it during the execution of the program, and the worst would be to be forced to use the default character set. But any case is acceptable since I don't know exactly what I want to do, but it changes what is possible.
