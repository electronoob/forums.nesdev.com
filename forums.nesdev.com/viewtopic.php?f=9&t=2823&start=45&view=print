<br />
<br />
<br />PS: i just check my order with FUTURLEC 
<br />
<br />My eprom order was Wrong 
<br />I got 32 pin ones...... 
<br />wich was 4.50$ 
<br />the 28 pin one are 6.50$ 
<br />
<br />the ones needed at atmel (flash 256k 28 pin dip)
<br />+ i email them saying if it isn't too late i will take 512k aswell. 
<br />
<br />On the website it didn't mention that my order was shipped yet (thank god)

<br />
<br />&amp; the the Excitebike i will need 2x AT29C256 256k 120ns CMOS Flash Memory

I can't even find that page you linked to, just this (the correct, apparently out of stock one - <a href="http://www.futurlec.com/Memory/AT29C256pr.shtml" class="postlink">http://www.futurlec.com/Memory/AT29C256pr.shtml</a><br /><br />I looked on <a href="http://findchips.com/" class="postlink">http://findchips.com/</a> and there are a couple obscure suppliers that seem to have them.  Never ordered from them before, but something you could try if you want.  BTW, you want the one ending in PC (DIP), not JC (PLCC).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">so what i need for the MMC1 is <br /> 1 	AT29C512 512k 120ns CMOS Flash Memory<br />&amp; 1    AT29C256 256k 120ns CMOS Flash Memory<br /></div><br /><br />No, those are kilobits.  512kbits = 64kbytes.  You want 512kbytes, the 29F040 (or 29C040, same thing).  If you order from them BTW, you might want to get the Atmel type.  Someone here on the forum ordered the '020 AMD type and got sent some "PMC" brand chips that the Willem programmer won't support.. he sent me a couple and I couldn't get them to burn either.  I guess because AMD doesn't make '020 FlashROMs, heh.<br /><br />I could sell you a couple brand new AM29F040B-120PC chips if you want, for $6 each + shipping.  A 512kB chip can replace a 256kB and 128kB chip too, BTW.  Just wire the unused pin(s) to GND or VCC if needed.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">but the AT29C256 256k 120ns CMOS Flash Memory are not in stock.... grr...</div>
<br />
<br />Yeah, that sucks.  It's apparantly a very hard to find chip.  Kinda surprising, considering how nice it is for replacing a 32kB EPROM.  EPROM is definitely going out of style.

<br />
<br />It works, and for games that only have PRG ROM it's really easy. Just go to the command prompt and type "EDIT /80" to enter edit in binary mode. Open your ROM and make sure the cursor is over the first character of the first row (will only work if the beginning of the first row says "NES"). Now, hit "Delete" on your keyboard 16 times, to get rid of the iNES header.
<br />
<br />What remains should be the PRG data. Save it now woth another name, such as "prg.bin", and check if the new file has the correct size. A 128KB game should have 131072 bytes, a 256KB game should have 262144 bytes - EXACTLY!
