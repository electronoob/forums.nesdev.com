<br />Well that's easy enough to do. I just added a nop on line 191 just after:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda $4016&nbsp; ; load RIGHT Status<br />and #1</div>

<br />It looks like if you add any command anywhere and assemble, it will fail.

<br />Only I don't use NESASM, so I can't assemble your sources...
<br />
<br />Good news: I found the problem. It's a branch that's out of reach, and it scares me that NESASM will not throw an error because this!
<br />
<br />Near the end of the moving logic you have "BNE infinite". Branches have a limited reach, and adding as much as a "nop" puts that command too far from the label "infinite", so the relative displacement is miscalculated (a good assembler would throw an error instead of miscalculating it!), and when this command is executed the program counter goes crazy and the program crashes.
<br />
<br />The generic solution for when branches are out of reach is to check for the opposite condition, skipping over a JMP instruction to the place you wanted to branch to. So you could replace this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;BNE infinite</div><br />with this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;BEQ skip<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;JMP infinite<br />skip:</div><br /><br />But in your case it would probably be easier to change this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;BNE infinite<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;dec Direction<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;JMP infinite </div><br />into this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;BNE skip<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;DEC direction<br />skip:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;JMP infinite</div>
<br />
<br />Anyway, keep in mind for future reference that branches shouldn't be used to jump across large distances. And it scares the shit out of me that NESASM will assemble the program with an incorrect displacement rather than throw an error.
<br />
<br />BTW, I seem to remember now that NESASM banks are 8KB in size, so you are in fact making a valid ROM with 16KB of PRG-ROM.

<br />Not that it matters but, I included NESASM.exe in the zip.
<br />
<br />I remember running into this problem but I thought it was with all commands that goto an address. I didn't know branches were more limited than JMP's.
<br />
<br />Everything you said makes perfect sense. Anything added inside of the infinite loop will push the branch further from the address it's branching to.
<br />That *is* really miserable that the assembler doesn't say anything.
<br />
<br />Thanks so much! I love when a problem gets resolved <strong>and</strong> you learn something.
<br />
<br />Just wondering, how did you catch it?

<br />FCEUXD's debugger. When the ball approached the paddle I started tracing instruction by instruction, until that branch sent the PC forward (as opposed to backwards, as expected) to a place with lots of 0's (which the CPU interprets as BRK's). As consequence of the BRK command the CPU jumped to the location pointed by the IRQ vector, $0000 in your case (although I advised you to have and actual IRQ routine with just an RTI instruction in it, not that it would save in this case, as the CPU was already lost when the IRQ happened, but still). well by that time the CPU was already completely lost and was trying to execute your variables as code, which is never good.

<br />
<br />Hey tokumaru;
<br />
<br />How precisely do I tell if I have more than one bank?  My asm file for a collision test I'm working on right now is 16.2 KB, but does an assembler count all my ;comments as part of the memory?
<br />
<br />Also, my collision test is running on FCEUXD, but is running very buggy on Nestopia and Nintendulator.  I suspect it might be the case you mentioned above, where I am trying to run too much memory on one bank.  I tried changing the ".inesprg 1" to ".inesprg 2" just in case my .prg is too large, but now all I get is a blank screen in all three emulators.  Is there anything additional I need to add to the code besides changing the inesprg in the header?
<br />
<br />Keep in mind I'm also using NESASM 3, which might also be part of the problem.  I know you and many on here use ASM6 instead of NESASM, and I'm thinking of making the switch.

If your code spills out of the bank there should be an error message somewhere (even though NESASM is known for generating invalid ROMs instead of reporting errors in some cases). Once you run into this problem you have to start writing code in another bank, and update the iNES header when necessary.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">My asm file for a collision test I'm working on right now is 16.2 KB, but does an assembler count all my ;comments as part of the memory?</div><br />No, the size of the source file has no direct relation to the size of the resulting binary.

<br />Yeah, it's hard to make anything serious with NESASM. It's not impossible, but you have to learn how to circumvent a few problems if you want to succeed with it.
<br />
<br />ASM6 is great, because it's really easy to use. You don't have to configure anything, just ask it to assemble a file and it does, and as long as your source code is correctly structured, a complete NES ROM is output. It is a generic 6502 assembler though, it's not specific to the NES, so it doesn't have automatic header generation or things like that. It's your responsability to make sure the iNES header is valid and correctly placed, and the same goes for each PRG and CHR bank. But if you have a good understanding of the structure of a NES file, this is not a problem.
<br />
<br />The problem with CA65 and other "professional" assemblers is that you have to configure a lot of things before being able to assemble anything, and for each project that uses a different mapper you are likely to change these configurations. You also have to deal with object files an linking, something that to this day I do not understand. Too much bureaucracy for me, I like to go straight to what matters.

<br />
<br />Could be, but it might be less code than you expect.  He said his .asm file was 16k, which includes comments.  I think I recognize his name from the nintendoage forums, so if he is working off the Nerdy Nights tutorials a lot of that space is likely data (eg, .db of a full background).  
<br />
<br />Even if we don't get into his collision code, at the very least we can check his iNES header and bank layout.

You basically are moving the blue square, and my goal was to make it stop whenever it collided with the reddish-brown square.  I've been working on it a few days, and just now (finally) got it to work as I expected.  Woo-hoo!  I know, nothing too impressive, but one small step at a time!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I have two versions of this file.  At first, all my collision tests for right, left, down, up were in the sections for those respective keys.  (That's the collision.asm file, and now it's working on all three emulators.)  My collision wasn't working right at first, so I moved the relevant code to subroutines.  Partly because I thought the code might be interfering with each other and subs might help, and partly because I wanted to practice writing subroutines and finding out what works and what doesn't.<br /><br />It turns out that I was doing something wrong with writing the subs.  Either I have typos or they're placed in the wrong place or something else altogether.  If you assemble the collision_subroutines.asm and run it on Nintendulator or Nestopia, you'll see what I mean.  Those two emulators scream, "this ROM is stupid!  For God's sakes just make it stop!"  FCEU, as I've been warned, is just like "Sure, man, do whatever ya want.  I'm just gonna sit here and chill while your incorrect rom runs as though its flawless..."  I think from now on I'm definitely testing my stuff on the first two, as I've read a comment from Sivak on Nintendo Age forums saying they're more accurate to a real NES.  I've also seen plenty of people on this forum say the same thing, like tokumaru.<br /><br />Anyway, I guess what I need to figure out now is what I'm doing wrong with my subroutines, as I mentioned above.<br /><br />If any of you want to look at this, please feel free.  My collision test code is very beginner, like I said.  So if you have any tips on cleaning it up I'll be glad to take it.  I know I've got a long way to go and a LOT to learn.  And I imagine I'll have to change it for a second collision object.  That's actually my next goal.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?jxdjdznjmog" class="postlink">http://www.mediafire.com/?jxdjdznjmog</a><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">metalslime wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I think I recognize his name from the nintendoage forums, so if he is working off the Nerdy Nights tutorials a lot of that space is likely data (eg, .db of a full background).<br /></div>
<br />I am actually using bunnyboy's tutorials, metalslime, as you'll see in the code.  I've been bouncing between Nintendo Age and Nesdev here since I started getting into this a couple weeks ago.  I've also been checking out your tummai games site, as well.  Very cool, but most of is beyond my skill level at this point.  I especially liked the button combos write up.
<br />
<br />PS- Am I too off-topic for this thread?  Do you guys need me to ask an admin to move it somewhere else?
<br />
<br />PPS- Oh yeah, I also forgot to mention that I've noticed that annoying grey tile in the upper left-hand corner.  For the life of me I can't figure out why the hell that thing is there.  I know it's something I did, but I've just been kicking it down the road in regards to fixing it.
