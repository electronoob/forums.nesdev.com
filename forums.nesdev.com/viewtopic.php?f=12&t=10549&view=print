		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wanting to get a flash cart to test some things on actual SNES hardware and without the funds for SD2SNES, I figured getting a deal on SUPER UFO PRO 8 would be a good compromise. It doesnt have any of the special chip support, other than DSP1 when a game with that chip is attached on top. Does it have a place on the board to solder in this chip? Does anyone have this cart, and could take a picture of the PCB?

The Super UFO has compatibility problems with games that have copy protection like Super Ghouls and Ghosts and Super Street Fighter II for example (sprite glitching). Also it only supports up 4MB (32mb) games.<br /><br />The SD version does not have a spot for a DSP chip, the old floppy version of the Super UFO Pro 8 does have a spot for the DSP chip to be installed internally. <br /><br />Here are some pics of the SD version.<br /><br /><img src="http://i236.photobucket.com/albums/ff289/diegoshark/blogsnes/super_Ufo_pro_8_c.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i236.photobucket.com/albums/ff289/diegoshark/blogsnes/super_Ufo_pro_8_d.jpg" alt="Image" />

Someone with various SNES systems tested the actual cartridges and came across the issue depending on the CIC revision used in the system. He tested the SD UFO and it had the issue with all but 1 system I believe.

Or maybe that was some other game in the Street Fighter II series. Not sure if you could call that copy protection, though - it's just how they made the game.<br /><br />I'm not aware of anything special done by Super Ghouls and Ghosts. Are you sure that the ROM is good?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes I left out SD2SNES because he seems concerned about cost.<br /><br />Tepples is correct, SF2 Turbo is 20 megabits which is slightly odd. SSF2 is a regular 32 megabit game, nothing special. Neither game has protections. Pretty sure Super GnG doesn't have anything either. If the games don't work on the UFO, then the rom is bad or it's emulation of the cartridge map is wrong.<br /><br />Update: Apparently UCON64 thinks SSF2 has protection to be cracked. But Super GnG didn't result in anything.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />After a little investigation I've found that the sprite corruption in Super Street Fighter 2 can be fixed with the &quot;slowrom fix&quot; option that SNES Tool 1.2 has.<br /><br />Does anyone know how the &quot;slowrom fix&quot; actually works?<br /><br />My understanding is that FastROM games need at least 120ns ROM access time to work properly (for DMA?), and it sounds like the Super UFO 8 cannot achieve this hence the sprite corruption. I have no idea how a software fix could solve a hardware issue...<br /><br />EDIT:<br />After a little research it appears a slowrom fix just removes the switch to higher speed.<br /><br />I can't see how this would work without major timing issues. Unless there are only some parts of the game code that need to run faster and I just never played to that part where it becomes an issue.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />At the title screen, the player can select 0 to 3 stars of speed boost. My guess is that this affects how often the engine performs a frameskip, which is two frames of game logic before one frame actually drawn to the screen.<br /><br />Have you tried doing slow projectiles (Ryu, Ken: half circle down to forward and press Jab, defaults to Y) and flashy special moves (Ryu, Ken: half circle down to back and press Roundhouse, defaults to R) with both players at once while slow ROM mode is in effect? That might stress the VRAM transfer mechanism.<br /><br />(Most GBA games likewise need a fast ROM disabling patch when run on a SuperCard.)
