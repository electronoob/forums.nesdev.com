Beats me. That is why it is such a sticky issue. <br /><br />BTW, it is not just copyrights that are the problem... Violations of trademarks and patents are other tools used to sue and win. The US patent office is so painfully broken that people have managed to win money for even the most ridiculous of claims. I imagine that this problem does not exist in most countries.<br /><br />Some companies have won their claims, while others have lost. (Sometimes it is even the same company) It seems that it is really subjective and depends on what court is over seeing the case. That is why for most cases the burden of proof to is just too high/complex for a company to find pursuing prosecution a worthwhile endeavor. Scare tactics seem to work very well for the bigger companies, so those big companies rarely even need to consider how to prove their case in court.<br /><br />If some dumb government entity incorrectly registered a game mechanic or idea, then it would be the developers responsibility to prove that it is invalid.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4048">HJRodrigo</a> — Tue Nov 15, 2011 5:36 pm</p><hr />

You guys are making it way too hard. <br /><br />By definition any game using a trademarked/copyrighted character or idea without permission is unlicensed. Meaning they did not get permission from Disney to use their character. Even if everything is coded and drawn from scratch, but the game is heavily "inspired" by another company's work it would be an unlicensed game as it did not receive permission from that company. For instance the Pacman vs Munchkin lawsuit. Munchkin is not a "pirate" game. Unlicensed games are extremely common, but the burden of proof is too high in most cases to warrant prosecution.<br /><br />A pirate game is a game that is sold that contains another company's work/product/code without consent. For instance those 100 in 1 carts that contain the games from other companies. Technically all sold ports that contain the exact graphics of the game it emulates (without prior consent) is a pirate game. <br /><br />A homebrew can be an unlicensed game if contains the IP of another company without first obtaining permission. This includes gameplay elements. tokumaru's game could still be considered an unlicensed game (Even if it used no characters from sonic) by SEGA if its gameplay is too similar to sonic's. If said homebrew contained code and/or graphics from previous sonic games and is sold it would be a pirate game. <br /><br />I think the big problem here is that people are only viewing a licensed game as one that Nintendo authorized to be made for the system. For example, the game Jurassic park by Ocean not only needed a license from Nintendo, but also Universal in order to be considered a fully licensed product. If it only had the one from Nintendo then it would still be an unlicensed game. Many games that are made today have several licenses, as they use resources from multiple companies.<br /><br />Edit#3 Pirate games are clearly illegal and tend to take little effort to prove, but unlicensed games are a sticky mess and in some rare circumstances can even be "protected" by certain laws.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4048">HJRodrigo</a> — Tue Nov 15, 2011 4:37 pm</p><hr />

I tend to classify games like this:<br /><br />Unlicensed - made by a 3rd party that made a game containing all of their own content.  No sprites/music/trademarked characters were used.<br /><br />Pirate - Anything that is hacked (sprite/graphic replacement,  NNN-in-1), FDS to cartridge conversions, etc.<br /><br />Pirate Original - Anything that is an original game (i.e. no stolen graphics or code which is obviously stolen) but uses trademarked characters.  i.e. the multiple DKC games,  or the Lion King, etc.<br /><br />Of course there's plenty of grey area here.  But this is unavoidable.  Stuff like Tengen Tetris is NOT a pirate,  it's merely unlicensed (in the respect of categorization).  Tengen did indeed buy a license for Tetris, it just happened to be somewhat bogus.  The whole thing surrounding Tetris is pretty insane anyways, so I'd call it merely unlicensed... especially since Tengen bought their license in good faith.<br /><br />Things get sticky when you have a pirate of a pirate original, like a fighting game that has been hacked, but I guess you could just call that a pirate. (it'd be silly to call it a pirated pirate original, haha).<br /><br />I would also indicate a 4th category just for FDS to cartridge conversions since these are pretty interesting and it'd be nice to know which were converted.  I know of at least 8-10 of them so far.<br /><br />So, if I were doing it, I'd have these 4:<br /><br />Pirate<br />Pirate FDS Conversion<br />Pirate Original<br />Unlicensed<br /><br />With possible modifiers, or things that might fall into both categories.  One that immediately comes to mind is Action 52, since it uses a ripped off music engine, ripped off music, and that music loop at the start, and they snagged a multicart menu system for their menu... But the rest is all original (cough).   So, the A52 would be pirate/unlicensed since it contains elements of both.   They are not trying to pass it off as another game (i.e. changing sprites to turn Felix the Cat into Pokemon), so I do not consider it a full-on pirate.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=230">kevtris</a> — Tue Nov 15, 2011 11:09 am</p><hr />

To clarify 3gengames's point: SNES Doom falls into the same category as NES Donkey Kong, NES Mario Bros., NES Klax, SNES Street Fighter II, and SNES Mortal Kombat: authorized ports.<br /><br />But I guess you're on the right track. Start by documenting all NES and Famicom cart releases not licensed by Nintendo, and categories will emerge.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Nov 14, 2011 4:30 pm</p><hr />
