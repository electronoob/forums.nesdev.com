<br />Why is there no homebrew for n64?
<br />
<br />Is it to complex or no interrest? And the future? is modern console homebrew out of the question?

It certainly isn't as easy as NES or SNES where you have so many options like the PowerPAK or building your own cartridge, for SNES the tons of copiers and the Super FlashCart and such. The N64 has some expensive and hard to find copiers but that's about it.
<br />
<br />And who knows how accurate the N64 emulators are really. Also I imagine there aren't many helpful development tools or information other than maybe official documents which again might not be very helpful. 
<br />
<br />I'm sure there are many reasons. And honestly I'd rather develop for PS1 than N64.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you have an Xbox 360 and a fairly recent PC, you can rent Microsoft's "XNA Creators Club" modchip to develop and run Xbox 360 homebrew for $99 per year. But then you have to rewrite your game in C#, or in the subset of C++ that can be machine-translated to C#. (This subset is called "/clr:safe" if you want to Google it.)
<br />
<br />PLAYSTATION 3 can run Linux on half the system, which should be good enough for any 2D game you can think of.
<br />
<br />GBA and DS are thoroughly cracked.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I've been to that Hitmen one. But yeah, both N64 and PS1 dev look pretty dead. I can't really fathom having a question that really needs answering if you're to progress with developing for either of those systems. You might get an answer some day if you post the question. Here, I've had several of those types of questions, and it's even taken me a while to understand everything here where your questions are usually answered within a few hours of posting it. It just seems incredibly hard to learn about those systems where almost no one is there to help you.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes it seems a lot of the people that where interested in programming for the PS1 moved on to the ps2 and a lot  of them have moved on to the Wii as of now, although there is still a lot of active ps2 developers.
<br />
<br />Personally I cannot see a reason to develop for the ps1 over the ps2, the same controller setup and such and more power to work with. esspecually these days when running ps2 homebrew is so easy to do now that we have FMCB and ESR. way easyer that ps1 stuff even with a modchip.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The problem with modern console homebrew is that it's mostly just emulator ports making little use of the console's hardware or personality.
<br />People do this because obviously people like to pirate games, it's easy to steal an emulator's thunder by porting it to a console, and it's hard to develop a commercial quality game on a modern console. In contrast retro homebrew generally are original games.
