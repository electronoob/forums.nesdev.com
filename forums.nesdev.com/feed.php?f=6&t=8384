I know rebumping threads is not a good idea BUT...<br /><br />I remember sending you 50 bucks around 2015 for some NSF rip requests, when I had zero clue how to rip anything (which was also the kinda of way saying &quot;Thank You!&quot; for the almost 20 years of work in these files). <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br />Since then I kinda became a machine gun when it comes to doing stuff like this.<br />Time flies sure fast. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6513">MrNorbert1994</a> — Sun Jan 14, 2018 12:58 pm</p><hr />

You did so much work, it was for the labor of it and not the files. I say sure, why not, if they want to it's a win for both parties. I'm sure you won't make a killing, but maybe you'd get enough to just spend a night out, that's the least the people who you brought all the NES game music they loved isn't a big deal at all. And he's not asking for it, people have offered it, and he's declined usually but is now thinking of maybe accepting them, I don't see how you think he's asking for them. If I ever get a paypal I'd gladly give you $10, one day I will, I listen to NSF's once in a while and would love to thank you for it. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Tue Dec 06, 2011 1:16 pm</p><hr />

One thing I'd like to say is that you're basically asking for donations for ripping and distributing code that doesn't belong to you. I understand the work that it is, but that is something to think about.<br /><br />But, I wouldn't really be offended. I don't see too much problem with making money for doing work, if the copyright holders don't care. <br /><br />All that said, I am not a hardcore archive buff. If a game has been dumped, it is archived. The nsf is an extra step for fans of the game, but I don't lose sleep on games that have been dumped but not nsf ripped. <br /><br />I wouldn't personally donate much, because I haven't really used your services. My NSF collection contains exactly one NSF. I did <em>used to have</em> slightly more, maybe around ten? <br /><br />Did you happen to rip Mother/Earthbound Zero in 2000? If so, I'd consider throwing a few bucks your way since that's the one nsf I do listen to.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Tue Dec 06, 2011 12:09 pm</p><hr />

I'd like to say, before anyone gets the wrong idea. I have through the years since approximately 1999 thoroughly enjoyed NSF ripping without too many accolades. Although, don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed when others appreciated my work and many have.<br /><br />Although, NSF ripping to me has become more of a burden than anything else which is why I stopped ripping any NSFs since August. It got to the point where a good deal of them are really difficult and it just seemed more like a job. Especially so since I have people demanding NSFs from me and getting mad because I haven't provided for them or the NSF wasn't exactly what they expected or it wasn't complete. Also those few who were talking to me in the third person format as though I didn't exist and it was obvious for awhile that I was the only one doing it. Even though, one person had pointed out this fact. Even though it is a minor insult that I usually ignored. Occasionally, it would bother me.<br /><br />I spend a great deal of time ripping NSFs, some of them are easy enough to get within an hour or two and some of them require a great deal of time. Anywhere from 4-8 hours up to a month or two and some of them I worked off and on for several years. No kidding!<br /><br />I also spend a good deal of money to test these NSFs on the real thing, IE.. a front loading NES, NES PowerPak and several CF cards. I've spent over $300 on this project. Although, don't worry I ain't complaining about that. I really like my setup. But just saying I've spent money and lots more time which can be considered equal to money in some respect. Only to have people demanding and treating me like crap after all the effort.<br /><br />Now I'm done complaining. I hope no one minds.<br /><br />I also realize that everyone does a lot of work here with no thought of reward and I am the same way for the most part until lately. Although, until recently, I've always refused donations but now I'm really considering it. But not to worry, I'm not charging and never will for my effort. But if anyone thinks that the effort I have done is worth it, then please donate. Although, there is no obligation. But only do so after anyone is completely satisfied with the final version and NOT before the NSF is completely finished. The old same rule still applies as well, I can't rip every NSF and I would only know if I can until I start working on it and get it ripped.<br /><br />I have also read the Parodius Networking Policy which permits personal donations on this network which does host NESdev and it's forum. <br /><br />I have also talked to a bunch of people about it and not one person has objected to accepting personal donations. Stating that they think it's right because of the time and effort involved.<br /><br />Although, before I actually do this. I would like some feedback about this subject. I wouldn't mind some compensation and at the same time I do not wish to offend anyone or this community. I love this place and I've been here for a long time.<br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />Any questions are welcome as well.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=43">Gil-Galad</a> — Tue Dec 06, 2011 11:11 am</p><hr />
