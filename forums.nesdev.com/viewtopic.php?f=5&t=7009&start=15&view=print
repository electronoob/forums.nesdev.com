<br />There's nothing wrong with the guide, Celius is saying it's the way it was posted.  Even if you don't sense it, for many people there can be an understood "hey, you're pretty stupid, I'm linking this guide rather than giving you the help you wanted because I only feel disdain for you."  And when someone calls them on it, they can deny the whole thing and say they meant it to be helpful.
<br />
<br />Some people post this way all the time, sounding down-to-earth but being as rude as possible.
<br />
<br />However, I do not mean to say that Blargg does this, or that anyone else on the board does this; just that people can interpret it that way and they're not always wrong.
<br />
<br />
<br />As for my own commentary on this thread, I haven't noticed Blargg in particular saying or doing anything really unreasonable, for the most part.  I like a lot of people here and respect even more.  Some people seem to be needlessly negative, but for the most part it's a good board full of great information.

<br />Whenever I've posted it, it was to say "stop being selfish; put some effort into posting about your problem, so that the time we spend answering can have the most benefit". I make a a fair number of posts with what I consider kind of subtext, and I do believe that most people pick up on it, even if they can't put their finger on it (I'm saying that they are affected in a bad, non-constructive way). I try to avoid this, but it's difficult sometimes with the quality of some "help wanted" posts. It's all in perception, of course, which is why I work on trying to be sure I'm accurately perceiving whether someone is really being careless and selfish.

<br />
<br />Putting the "in your face" message about their selfishness/laziness won't bring any constructive criticism since people will never admit it in the first place anyway (human nature, again).  Some people may start on a bad feet (don't know if it's english or not) and re-adjust once they "get used" to the community.  The people that really have interest in the subject will make effort in the end and "fit-in". The others, they will just drop and go away.
<br />
<br />So the snarky message like "Let me google this for you" or anything similar will not bring anything to any new member in the community:  you're just wasting your time and there are other ways to say it more politely. I don't see any issues to use those kind of message for existing users when you want to be sarcastic (like I always like to do) and put some humor into it when original members are just plain lazy, why not? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />In brief: It may be appropriate in some situation to point it out if humor is used adequately. In other, it doesn't bode well.  The thing is to be able to figure out when it's appropriate or not to use them.

<br />
<br />Okay, that's fair enough. It's kind of like telling someone who has been diagnosed with depression to lighten up; it's not that easy. However, the online environment is a bit different from face-to-face interactions. When you're around someone and you're in a bad mood, there are various things people can pick up from you where they can tell you're in a bad mood. It can be very hard to hide what you're feeling. But when posting online, you are making a choice, every time you hit a key on the keyboard, to communicate a certain message. Your mood doesn't have to be put in the mix. Even if you're feeling like crap, you can write a sentence that indicates otherwise (or a completely neutral sentence that has no emotion).
<br />
<br />With that said, I find when you are mixing in a negative tone, you are to some extent, going out of your way to mix it in; in other words, it's voluntary. If you're going to volunteer to write a post, you may as well volunteer to write a more positive post, than a negative post.
<br />
<br />Now, about people posting generic questions, and giving little information. I see where you're coming from with this. It is in a lot of cases, a reflection of one's selfishness to simply post "how do I do this?" or "can someone post code that does this?", but a lot of times it isn't. For example, when I first came here, I asked questions and provided very little additional information with what I was trying to do, simply because I didn't know what additional information was required. I thought there were simple, single answers to a lot of the questions I asked. Often, the answer I got was "what exactly are you trying to do?" or "there's more than one answer to that question; it depends on what you're doing." 
<br />
<br />You need to first determine when exactly you are dealing with a user who doesn't know what additional information is required, and when you're dealing with someone who's just lazy, before you write something like "just f***ing google it".
<br /> 
<br />I will fully admit, however, that I didn't at times listen to the responses given, and this isn't an acceptable behavior. Also, it might have had a lot to do with the fact that I was <em>way</em> in over my head; I had absolutely no clue what I was doing and I asked questions about things way beyond someone who doesn't even know how to code basic programs. In that aspect, any frustration with such users is completely understandable. The right thing to do with such users is probably to advise they start small, and learn more about programming in general before moving on to game programming. Unfortunately, a flaw of my character, impatience for working toward long-term goals, got in the way of me listening to such advise.
<br />
<br />What I find funny is that in that scenario, blargg was kind enough to contact me through email and offer to help me out, as well as answer additional questions I had. That, I found very respectable. I benefited a lot from that. And during that time, I didn't get any of this negative tone from blargg that I'm talking about right now. And actually, that's probably why I found our conversations so helpful.

<br />Weebles by Playskool. A few generations of the toyline (such as <a href="http://pics.pineight.com/weeb3.jpg" class="postlink">2004's "Weebleville"</a>) were made with molded faces and arms as opposed to the egg-shapes that Playskool just recently returned to. I was exposed to one of these sometime around 1996. But they seem to go back and forth between eggs vs. molded by generation, as does Nintendo with dragon-style Blargg and blob-style Blargg.

<br />
<br />I've no problem with someone who has attempted to understand and is asking for help, especially if he explains what his understanding is, so we know what to build on and so we can diagnose the shortcomings with current documentation. It's not basic questions that are annoying; it's questions that are due to not putting forth effort. See <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7025" class="postlink">a recent thread about NES initialization</a> for an example of good effort and the learner providing useful feedback so that those helping can see that they are indeed helping, and seeing what works/what can be improved.
