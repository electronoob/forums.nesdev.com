		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The APU runs at &quot;roughly&quot; 3.07 MHz, with 64 S-DSP cycles and 32 S-SMP cycles per sample. The 32040.5 Hz sample rate implies a 3075888 Hz overall APU rate. I don't see where the 22 enters into anything.<br /><br />If I were designing a &quot;performance&quot; profile, I'd produce one APU cycle for every 7 master clock cycles. That'd give 945/44*1000000/7/96 = 31960.22 Hz.

For whatever reason, the one in the SNES seems to tend fast.<br /><br />And using a large prime number makes it harder for people to make timed code that will fail on actual hardware when the clock rates don't match, without needing to dynamically change the clock rate every time the emulation starts.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you're going to make an HDMA streaming code work on every SNES (except for broken ones) you probably want it to tolerate any rate between 64.5 cycles per scanline to 65.5 cycles per scanline.  I think having 9 lines of data plus 2 scanlines for timing would be a good idea, because 9 lines would be enough for 4 BRR blocks, and 11*20 = 220 which is close to 224 lines.

This is a bit long even for PAL, but it works okay if you keep the data bursts short.*  For NTSC it's a full cycle too long and will quickly get out of sync.  In any case, if 32040.5 works but 32040 doesn't, it suggests that he was pushing the timing a little hard, and I wouldn't trust it on a real SNES.<br /><br />But I haven't actually examined the issue, so take the above with a grain of salt.  For all I know there could have been a bug in bsnes...<br /><br /><br />* <span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">It helps that he just dumps the data to the stack and relocates it later, rather than writing it directly to the desired location like my proposed method, because the stack method is faster and leaves more room for timing slop.  This is why I need a hot-swappable sub-cycle delay block and he doesn't.</span>

If you choose to use a 7-year old release, it's on you.<br /><br />Regardless, it really doesn't matter what value is chosen, so long as it's within the accepted tolerance of the ceramic capacitor.<br /><br />I would bet large sums of money d4s' streamer will break on some real hardware units, but certainly not most ... he's really thorough about testing his stuff.
