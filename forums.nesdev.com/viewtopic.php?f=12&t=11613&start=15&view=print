Thanks to the bigger size in each bank, I'm been able to code all command-script routines in the same bank, which is really faster and more compact size than splitting 41Kbytes of code into 2 banks: if I would have decided to use mode 20, I would have had to call all routines with JSL (which is slower and longer) and wouldn't have been able to use BRA branching, not to mention I would have had to decide what to do with the spare 23Kbytes in the second bank, which is too small for other game engines (tasking engine is about 30 Kbytes) and too small for graphics. You can see the same problem in Treasure Hunter G, where the code is too dispersed all over the first 20 banks, mixed up with some data.

And given the present subject matter I think SPC700 might be a bit much for the OP to grasp right now.  (Audio is always it's own beast...)<br /><br />To clarify my original point though: audio emulation/translation under a VM, even an HVM hypervisor, has always been crappy in my experience: high latencies, samples that don't play all the way through (e.g. sound layer is clipping playback early), mixer/volume issues (as in clipping), and a multitude of other things.  Given how sensitive emulators are to audio playback frequency and latency (see the bajillion of threads discussing all of this), I'm of the strong opinion it's best to do the audio bits natively on something (i.e. use an emulator on your native OS, not under a VM -- or better yet actual NES/FC hardware).  OS X people don't have as many choices as Win32 people do.<br /><br />That's all I was trying to get across.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />And to be clear: what you listed off aren't registers, they're PPU memory ranges/memory addresses.  They aren't accessible natively by the CPU, i.e. you cannot do something like <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">sta $3f10</tt> and write to part of the sprite palette.<br /><br />You have to access the PPU through memory-mapped I/O registers (on the NES things like $2000/2005/2006/2007, on the SNES $2116/2117/2118/2119 (including if you choose to use its DMA capabilities ($42xx)).  Like on the NES, you have to select what PPU address you want to write to using $2006, then use $2007 to write the actual byte/data to it.  They're called &quot;memory-mapped&quot; because they are addresses within the CPU addressing space that can let you access addressing spaces outside of the CPU -- &quot;memory-mapped&quot; = &quot;what the CPU can access/read from/write to natively&quot;.<br /><br />And these are different from actual CPU registers.  Yes, the word &quot;register&quot; is used differently/contextually and that's often confusing, but know that up front.  And if someone uses the term &quot;register&quot; to you, and they don't give you good context?  Call them out on it / ask them to clarify.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I wouldn't label a range of memory 'registers' either, unless they are specifically memory mapped registers, and at that - only in the context of talking about the device. To access register 'x' (of the device), write to port/address 'whatever'. For memory ranges, inside or outside a device, that are specifically for certain types of data or sets of data - I'd never refer to them as registers. Best to correct that now, so you don't get someone confused when trying to talk about such stuffs. But yeah, nametables, memory for holding graphic cells, attributes, etc I don't think could even be considered registers in the traditional sense. <br /><br /> If a memory mapped register is specific to an action (you read it for status, or you write to change functionality - and it directly corresponds to a 'register' on the device), then I usually refer to it as a register. I.e. &quot;Read the PPU status register&quot;.<br /><br /> Slightly off topic, but I sometimes refer to ZP/DP area of memory as address registers. They're actually indirect address <em>vectors</em>, but that's what address registers do on other processors. But I usually only do this in the context of the name I've chosen to reserve in that ZP/DP area for indirect addressing (I usually name them something like A0, A1, A2, or R0, R1, R2, etc).

I'll be more careful in the future, lol. But thank you for clarifying the proper terminology to me.<br /><br />I've been messing with Geiger's debugger, it has (imo) the best hex viewer for the snes, especially ram, I can watch it in real time. Anyway, I was screwing with the vram in hex during Megaman X, and noticed that the highway intro level uses 2 backgrounds, I started messing with tiles at $A000, the closest to the screen, and $B000, the furthest from the screen. I was randomly overwriting the tiles, and noticed that megaman appeared behind the tiles I was drawing. I noticed that an individual tile has 16bits/2bytes of properties. So does this mean tiles have a BG setting for sprites, making them appear infront/behind tiles?
