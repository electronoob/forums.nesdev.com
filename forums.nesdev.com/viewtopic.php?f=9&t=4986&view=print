<br />
<br />what is wrong with unif?  i thought that was the new.  i actually didnt have any intension of supporting ines either.  i use it now, but intend on converting to unif.
<br />
<br />i know there is ines2, but that is ontop of ines1.  i agree there needs to be a fix to the older version, but take out the garbage, remove the old and start over.  anyone that is going to use a newer format will likely have a newer emulator to use the newer format.
<br />
<br />at the moment i am relying on correct ines header info for mappers, but as i add more and improve i will need correct header information.  i do not intend on adding a game database, that is a job for utility.  fix once.
<br />
<br />( and for those that say no one will be able to use my emu without ines:  there are plenty out there to choose from, and mine will be open source, feel free to change it)
<br />
<br />matt

Games still work with iNES, right? I hardly think that emulating those crappy HK pirate games is worth the trouble of using UNIF. Really, that's all I've seen UNIF being used for.

<br />
<br />Heh, I could almost see that coming... :P
<br />
<br />And on a more general scale, I would say that it sure would be tragic if a person did NOT feel embarrassed about how they behaved 10 years ago. Naturally, people evolve and re-consider their viewpoints.
<br />
<br />In another 10 years he just might feel embarrassed that he ever felt the need to feel embarrassed over what kind of person he was 10 years earlier in his life. Or alternatively, he might just have a good laugh about it, the same way I believe most of us will when we remember how we once were.
<br />
<br />My impression of him from back then is similar to the impression I usually get from highly talented people such as him: a really cool guy in some ways, and really silly in other ways. And come to think of it, that's the best judgment I myself could hope for. :)
<br />
<br />When you talk to him next time, tell him I said hi and hope he's doing well!

<br />Maybe, but only Hong Kong pirate multi-cart crap, AFAIK. Anything could run with iNES though, you just have to create a new mapper if the board is too weird. Mapper numbers will run out eventually, of course.

<br />Fair enough, but do we have to use UNIF to solve this? I only bother with iNES with my tools and toys because it is simple.

<br />Oh, I was by no means endorsing UNIF, just stating some of iNES's biggest limitations. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />Is gif/png style tagged format such a terrible thing? 4 character codes with a length for each chunk seems pretty easy to me. for attributes like board, mapper, features, etc as long as everyone can agree on a fourCC you're gold.

<br />ROM hackers wouldn't be able to distribute their hacks as binary patches unless you design and implement a new chunked diff format and diff/patch tools. But then I might be biased because I have a ROM hacker cousin who goes by Nova Yoshi.
