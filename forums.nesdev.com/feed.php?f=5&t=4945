Because those connectors suck and for lots of us wear down after the first couple of days. They usually work perfect at first, and then quickly decline because the way it works is so stupid and unreliable. It is obvious to anyone who owns a Gameboy, SNES, Sega Genesis, etc. that relying on tension for the connector proves to be much more reliable. That's why I flipped mine over to use the tight end for games, and the loose end for the thick motherboard.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Mar 15, 2009 4:51 pm</p><hr />

I mean they see either:<br /><br />1 - It works<br />or<br />0 - It doesn't work<br /><br />People need to start seeing functionality of things with more than 1-bit precision. See, because something might be sort of broken, and not absolutely broken. Say the high bit is the "it works" bit in the following example. Someone says their "NES doesn't work". They see its functionality as:<br /><br />00000000<br /><br />When it's only the connector that's broken, so in actuality the functionality is something like:<br /><br />01111011<br /><br />Where it mostly works, just one little thing is broken. Forgive the wacky analogy; that's just how I see it  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> . If you didn't get it, all I'm saying is when something "doesn't work" that doesn't mean it's completely not working. There may be a small part that doesn't allow it to work, and you have to find out what that is and fix it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Fri Mar 13, 2009 7:47 pm</p><hr />

I guess it is a common problem to get vertical lines on the screen and scrabled graphics. This is due to one of the CHR Dx not being connected, so the PPU fetch data that has always one bit set to '1', so vertical lines happen and wrong tiles are picked half of the time.<br /><br />The connector is probably the problem here, not the NES. I have a NES that doesn't work at all any longer, with an oscilloscope I could see that the CPU is running as exepted, but nothing shows on the PPU.<br /><br />So yeah this is a common problem, the NES connector is pure crap, and altough many  people came with hundreds of miracle solutions (new connectors, clean it with anything or flip it vertically), none of them really works.

For the NES side of things, I'm pretty sure their patents expired or something so that it's not illegal for us to do NESDev. I have 2 famiclones made by Yobo. Though I don't know about the legality on the SNES side of things...<br /><br />As for getting it, it's good if all you want to do is play some NES games and don't care about accuracy. However, you won't be able to play games like Castlevania 3 that are hard to emulate. It is basically a hardware emulator.<br /><br />Your old toaster NES is the most accurate (well, duh). I really doubt anything is wrong with your system other than the connector. You can get replacements or flip it upside down. I made a thread here called "Getting games to work in the front loading NES" that you can read to figure out how to do this. People say the trick didn't work for them, but me and like 1 other person have been using the trick for a long time now to get games to work pretty much 100% of the time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Thu Mar 12, 2009 4:19 pm</p><hr />
