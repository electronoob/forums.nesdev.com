<br />I can't speak for everyone, but for me personally, I'm not looking for dirt cheap (I'm willing to spend hundreds if the device is excellent).  What I've been wanting for a very long time is a native NES&lt;-&gt;PC hookup that would allow me to develop and work on an MMC3-based game with battery-backed SRAM, and not have to continually swap in/out EEPROMs, CF cards, etc..  :-)  I mean, that's all I'm looking for (I make it sound like it's easy don't I?)

<br />
<br />Indeed, you can put an MCU with a parallel port (such as many PICs) right onto the data bus and even have IRQ support (that's what my original Squeedo design did - with that, I ditched the controller port).
<br />
<br />But, it turns out it's such as kick-ass feature, that it potentially useful for people who want to make carts of their game (while keeping the cost down).  Call me hopeful. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Sure, one could do DRM-'ed downloads of game, but I'm doubtful that anyone wants that.
<br />
<br />It just keeps the costs of the other carts down, hopefully.  (or at the least, adds nothing to the cost)

<br />
<br />clueless, great find. Lots of similarities indeed. Interesting that this was in 1996, which was right around the time I first made the SNES version of this serial cable and devcart. Looking at my source code creation dates, it was mid-June 1996.

<br />That pinout is incomplete, the NCs must be D3 and D4.  If that pinout is for the controller, then DATA is D0.  You would leave clock and strobe open, but then the NES can only receive (if that's what you want).  Strobe could send from the NES, but it's not on that schematic.

<br />
<br />There will still be an MCU on the cartridge.  I will be using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus" class="postlink">CAN bus</a> as a connector on both designs (it's for a separate, stand-alone use I have in mind), and perhaps also through the exp pins.  But yeah, the data bus + IRQ would be the preferred interface for custom carts, then $4017.D1 is for any 'standard' cartridges.  The Squeedo cartridge, if things work out, could do a DMA transfer..!

<br />Well, devcarts themselves can have all bells and whistles on them, but the cart with the final game on it does not have to have any of it...

<br />...I love the controller ports of MD... 7bit bidirectional parallel port, with IRQ support, or up to 4800 bad RS-232C, no need to juggle with extra chips and stuff as long as you got LPT port on PC ^^

<br />...which nobody does any more -- thankfully at that (hey man, do you want STD, ECP, EPP, bidir, snakes-in-the-grass, or tepples DDR mode?).  On the other hand, you can get a USB/LPT adapter which should work, but I don't know how many of them support bidirectional transfer.  At least there's a standard USB base class for them (read: no drivers needed).

At one point I bought a PCI LPT port adapter because I had so many parallel devices, but the adapter quit being usable after I left Win98.  I had all kinds of ungodly problems using the LPT version of CopyNES with most of my PCs.  Now I use it for an EPROM emulator, EPROM burner, and nothing else.
<br />
<br />But, that old PC-to-NES schematic by sepi for using the LPT port, that's on this site, that was the first electronic circuit I ever built.  It worked, too.

<br />
<br />kevtris, who designed the CopyNES, has one installed in an FC.  It won't fit in the case, I think you would use a (short) 40-to-40 pin DIP cable to bring the CPU connection to the CopyNES board, outside.  I don't think there's anything else different about it.  If you don't have it already, perhaps you could ask retrousb if they can provide one without the CPU pin header (so you wouldn't have to remove it).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, I've just about got this new scheme supported for the boot loader. Memblers, what are your thoughts on also having D4 be one of the allowed inputs? Your hardware would of course just put serial on D1.
<br />
<br />To recap, software would have to support serial on $4017 D0, D1, and D4. D0 because the standard controller using that, and every cable has to connect that. D1 for your setup, and as a bit that isn't connected on the NES controller, so it won't interfere.
<br />
<br />D4 as an alternate bit that IS connected on the NES controller, to allow a second controller pass-through cable that connects D0 to the controller normally. This leaves D3 free to be connected to the CTS output from the PC, if ever desired. By having serial on D4 rather than D3, code written specially for D4 only could use CPX $4017 to put the state of D4 into the carry bit, without the state of D3-D0 affecting the result.
<br />
<br />The main question is whether supporting $4017.D4 for input poses any problems for you, or other potential problems. Would you be using D4 as some other status input that could change on its own?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sounds good, I had planned to ignore those bits, so the zapper and powerpad can be used normally.  Actually I haven't really looked at the NES mainboard to see how that's hooked up, for example could I poll the zapper (in the controller port) from the expansion port?  That would be cool, but I doubt it's that easy.
<br />
<br />The PIC32 UARTs support CTS/RTS, however if I have one dual-purposed as a selectable UART / SPI slave, then SPI clock is the same pin as the UART RTS out.  What would work however, is connecting the PIC's CTS input to the NES exp port OUT2 ($4016.d2 output from NES).
<br />
<br />On a side note, that CTS pin is shared with the SPI's slave-select, so by that perhaps the NES will be able to do SPI without controller-clocking interference (with a simple mod to the controller checking code).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I think they really do have those pins like that so you can read it externally by watching the pin.
<br />
<br />That makes sense about ignoring them. I can't really see a problem in supporting serial on D4, given that a read routine must support D0 anyway, and thus not play well with a controller connected and bring pressed. So I'll have it support D4, D1, and D0 unless anyone comes up with any problems. Then the low-cost cable will put it on D0, yours on D1, and a pass-through cable on D4.
<br />
<br />Oh yeah, an interesting idea I had for controllers that could tell the NES what type they are, based on how Apple did for its older RGB monitors: tie D3 and/or D4 to either ground, +5V, or Strobe. That gives 5 ID values, aside from them being unconnected. Might come in handy for one of these cables or something.
<br />
<br />RTS/CTS isn't part of the standard right now. It's just meant for minimal PC to NES really, so the above covers it. Interesting idea for having CTS on $4016.D2. I <em>have</em> figured out a really nifty way to handle output on D0 and D1, if/when we move into working out a standard for NES to PC.

With it having really precise timers available (perhaps up to 80mhz), I wonder if it could determine any kind of horizontal position.  Vertical position would be easy.
