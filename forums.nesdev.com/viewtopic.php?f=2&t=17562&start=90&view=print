Full configurability for a game like this would involve setting scanline count (262 or 312), NMI scanline (241 or 291), DPCM glitch compensation (on or off), CPU:PPU ratio cycle ratio (3 or 3.2), emphasis (NTSC BGR, PAL BRG, or 2C03 none), and probably a bunch more differences mentioned previously. That's a lot more than two steps.

They don't need to do that every time once they know what settings they want. Or whatever, this is getting a bit theoretical, but there are a lot of ways to not make this &quot;tedious&quot;, IMO.<br /><br />If we're discussing real games with actual needs, I doubt there's a practical need for more than 1 or 2 settings. Maybe 3 if you're pushing it. You're really planning to make a game that relies on <em>all of these things at once??</em> Why would you even want to do that? It sounds like you're making the game specifically about the &quot;problem&quot; of making the most problem out of the options.

This depends on CPU:PPU clock ratio, which differs between 2A07+2C07 and everything else.</li><li>In a game centered around music, the player might reasonably expect thicker instrumentation than <a href="http://battleofthebits.org/lyceum/View/nsf_classic%20(format)" class="postlink">nsf_classic</a> (BotB's term for 2A03 without the DPCM channel) alone can provide, and if compatibility with an unmodified NES is expected, this means samples. Reading an Arkanoid Controller requires carefully working around a quirk of the 2A03's DPCM DMA. A workaround to avoid this quirk by using OAM DMA is available, but it should not be used on 2A07 because the 2C07 requires OAM DMA to occur early (finishing within 20 lines after NMI).</li><li>Music tempo depends on the PPU scan rate.</li><li>Relative pitch between samples differs between the 2A07 and everything else.</li><li>PAL has more vblank time. If not a lot of vblank time is available, the game might fall back to simpler background animations.</li><li>The method to unlock this extra vblank time differs between PAL NES and PAL famiclones. </li></ul>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just to reiterate, I think that detecting between NTSC, PAL and DENDY timings for the purpose is can be very practically automated. I don't think this is error prone, or even really needs a user option as long as you're only adjusting timings with it. There are enough games out there that have ensured that almost all emulators and clones get that much right enough to use. That covers most cases of raster effects, music adjustment, etc.<br /><br />All this stuff about configurable number of scanlines, length of vblank, somehow needing an Arkanoid controller for a rhythm game, etc. whatever. If you want to make Configuration Hell: The Game, fine. I'm not trying to give advice to the person who's determined to create an intractable compatibility problem.<br /><br /><br />For another thought about designing around the idea that the options are tedious. You could even make it part of the game somehow. How about a room early on in your game where you're instructed to &quot;walk toward the red light&quot; and there's a light that comes on, enabling red emphasis as you get close, and a second one that's the same but green? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

If you've got an options menu, maybe not too tough to throw in, but automatically swapping duty for Dendy-style timings I think is going to have many false positive cases. (Sort of funny counterpoint, but many Dendy owners who were used to the music sounding a certain way had requested being able to intentionally swap duties in NSFPlay, so maybe also consider that sometimes the &quot;wrong&quot; thing is still desirable.)<br /><br />When I said NTSC / PAL / DENDY, I meant the three timing styles. I've never heard of a clone or emulator that doesn't fall into one of these 3 timing categories, aside from some experimental overclocking.<br /><br />Dendy is a 50hz machine intended for PAL regions, but very compatible with games made for NTSC assuming the 17% slowdown is acceptable. (Has same cycles per scanline as NTSC NES, just compensates with extra blank scanlines at the end of the frame where they will rarely do harm.) It was made for pirating NTSC region games, not the official PAL games.<br /><br /><br /><sub>* Please don&#39;t contrive some silly example of using inverted channels to completely cancel phase on some sound effect that is somehow mission critical.</sub>

It's not like the duty cycle swap makes the song go out of tune or anything, I guess that's why the cloners didn't notice the mistake in the first place. Regarding people growing up with the wrong duty, it wouldn't really apply to a newly produced homebrew though. If I made a song I may want people to remember it with the qualities I choose, preferably as consistent as possible for all players. I included a &quot;tuning fork&quot; in the options menu that plays a square channel at 440 Hz and with 50% duty cycle so the user can check pitch and duty of his machine himself. Now the problem is how to explain how 50% vs 25% duty sounds in the manual.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><sub>* Please don&#39;t contrive some silly example of using inverted channels to completely cancel phase on some sound effect that is somehow mission critical.</sub></div>That's Tepple's job.
