<br />
<br />Bought a few resistors today, so I'll probably attempt to perform the fix later tonight. I do not know much (nothing!) about resistors, but the ones I bought had brown-black-brown stripes, which I verified to mean 100 ohms, but I do not know what the 4th, golden stripe is exactly. Can anyone tell me if those will work fine? Thanks!

<br />brown=1, black=0, brown=multiple of 10, gold=5% tolerance (meaning it can be a 95 ohm resistor, and they'll sell it as 100 ohm)

<br />Thanks a lot! If I'm going to bust my PowerPak open and try my luck, I'd better at least have the right resistors! I've done soldering for devcarts and such before, so I guess I'll be OK. =)
<br />
<br />Sorry for getting a bit off-topic here! =)

<br />Hey bunnyboy! I really love your work, the PowerPak and your other stuff is really cool stuff and is probably better than sex for us NES-nerds(?) <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />However, I do have a wish!
<br />How about start replying e-mail/pm's? I guess it would be nice for people to know status of their shipments etc. Or even better, send out an e-mail when shipping the PowerPak, or the resistorfixed PowerPak. It won't take more than a few seconds. I don't even know if you have got my PowerPak for fixing (I can't trace packages outside Sweden sadly) as I sent a few weeks back and you don't answer my pm's. Perhaps you've got a good reason but it's kind of frustrating to be a customer when you don't get any feedback for your questions.

Yes I get too many emails, and most of it is already in the FAQ!  Need to outsource to India call center....
<br />
<br />EVERY package leaving here gets a confirmation number and an email sent to the buyer.  The PayPal and USPS emails are sent automatically, and gives all the status (order received, order shipped) without me having to spend time on it.  Whether people actually receive those emails is a different question  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I don't usually answer PMs just because the website/browser can't seem to keep me logged in.  Most likely to get a fast answer is AIM or IRC and I try not to give copy/paste answers there.

<br />
<br />Wow an answer. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> I didn't get an e-mail the first time I got the package. I'm just curious if you've got my PowerPak for resistorfixing or If I should start to worry...? It's really crap since I can't track packages outside Sweden.

<br />Odd... I never had that problem, even when writing up a complex reply.  Of course, I do have it set up to log me in automatically on this computer - maybe that makes a difference?

<br />I guess the resistorfix removed like 75% of the glitches but they're still quite visible in games that uses many sprites at once (I think I see this pattern anyway).
<br />Games that still has very visible glitches are SMB2 &amp; 3 for example (PAL-versions).
