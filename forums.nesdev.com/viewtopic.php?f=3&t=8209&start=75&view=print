<br />Manual control? Perhaps I read that out of context though.

<br />This file: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://cd.textfiles.com/group42/HACK/TV/MACROV.HTM">http://cd.textfiles.com/group42/HACK/TV/MACROV.HTM</a><!-- m --> states that the chrominance gain is keyed to the colorburst level, and that luminance gain is keyed to the Hsync pulse distance/back porch level.
<br />
<br />This book (previewable) seems to suggest that RF tuners typically have a single AGC keyed to the back porch level: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=U9aH92iLEZAC">http://books.google.com/books?id=U9aH92iLEZAC</a><!-- m -->  
<br />
<br />The "VCR" method was probably not commonly used but I imagine it would be preferred solution.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Now the question is whether this is relevant to the efforts here.
<br />
<br />The Famicom, for which the PPU was designed, initially only had RF output. A FC color profile will certainly have at least tuner AGC adjustment.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure if it's common for televisions to have AGC on composite input, but I'm fairly confident my late 90s CRT does because it will display pretty malformed video.
<br />
<br />Without composite AGC both NES and AV Famicom would have their own color profile because they use different (common-collector) amplifier and output circuits for composite, each with a different attenuation and output impedance leading to different levels at the display's input.
<br />
<br />Plus something I haven't seen mentioned in this thread is that the composite values were measured unloaded. This can have consequences in any DAC, but especially with a non-linear or current-source DAC, and the PPU's DAC should be both. When the pin was loaded the level became NEARLY ideal, but not exactly 1 Vpp (or is it 1.3 Vpp?). 
<br />
<br />Non-linearities aside, without AGC the measured levels are still inaccurate*. Wouldn't it be a double standard to not emulate composite at the output like the unideal real thing? Isn't it against significant figures to mix precision like this?
<br />
<br />*OMG

<br />It's not as bad as in your "Ugh. That's ugly." picture. I can't really tell from the smaller pictures. Also remember that when rendering is enabled, every other PPU frame is one cycle shorter than normal, resulting in a different dot crawl pattern. Some games like Battletoads keep rendering disabled past the point where the cycle would be skipped, so they look a little bit different.

<br />I also see some vertical color bleeding, so it probably has a filter or something.

<br />The end of level pole looks like dotted lines, where the right side is one pixel lower than the left side.

<br />
<br />Recapping the frame timing article:
<br />The NTSC 2C02 generates exactly 341 pixels, comprising of 227⅓ color cycles per scanline, so there is a 3-scanline jagged shift on screen for vertical color edges.  (Instead of what it should be per the spec: 227½. It turns out this doesn't matter for most NTSC decoders). Every other field, it omits one pixel (IIRC on scanline 20) causing on-screen flicker at 30Hz on sharp color edges. The visible period is 240 scanlines, with a 262-scanline field. Some games (Battletoads) disable rendering at the top of the field past scanline 20, in which case this pixel is never omitted. In this case, the flickr proceeds at 20 Hz(227⅓ × 262 = 59561⅓, the ⅓ is to fault. Omitting a pixel makes the width of that scanline 226⅔ color cycles and so undoes the extra ⅓ from the previous field)
<br />
<br />The PAL 2C07 also generates exactly 341 pixels, comprising of 284⅙ color cycles per scanline. But I don't know enough about how PAL works to know how the phase-alternating demodulation will affect edges. Unlike the 2C02, it never omits the pixel on scanline 20. The visible period is still 240 scanlines, but with a 312-scanline field.
<br />
<br />
<br />Back to bandwidth-limiting and square waves vs sine waves:
<br />OTA (when receiving via the RF modulator) the received signal almost certainly contains none of the higher overtones of the square modulator — The RF demodulator provides an extremely narrow 6MHz received band, and even though the NES is generating noise at higher harmonics (and I remember seeing them, back when OTA broadcast of NTSC was still a thing), the TV won't see them.
<br />
<br />Via the RCA jack in the back, I used a bandwidth tester on my 1990s RCA CRT television. Extinction frequency was 7MHz, so I'm unclear what difference a simulation using square vs sine waves will have. 
<br />
<br />BT.601 for digital sets demodulating NTSC necessarily has an extinction frequency below 6.75 MHz, since it samples at 13.5MHz.

<br />PPU producet only one filed and do not use interlace. That's why PAL looks like stable dots mesh. In interlace mode the subcarrier of two neighboring fields be blended and would not be noticeable.
<br />
<br />Sorry folks. Apparently PPU have a high-resistance output. When connected after the amplifier (on the AV connectors) signal is more adequate. In general, look, a complete record, I will give later. This is whole scanline, wich have 2 white bars and one black for level reference. Then we can see color subcarrier.
<br /><a href="http://savepic.su/426989.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://savepic.su/426989m.png" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />Color burst only.
<br /><a href="http://savepic.su/433133.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://savepic.su/433133m.png" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />And take a look closer to the process of transition between the white and colored signal. It's clearly seen that pixel areas are just signal gates for source phase subcarriers.
<br /><a href="http://savepic.su/418797.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://savepic.su/418797m.png" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />And what is it: sine or spoiled a square?

<br />
<br />If the scanline signal is shifted by 4 clocks every scanline, how come in all NTSC NES recordings I have seen so far, the edges between black and white pixels are completely artifactless while only color edges have artifacts?
<br />
<br />I am having trouble reproducing this kind of distinction in my emulator.
<br />
<br />As I understand it, a black &amp; white pixel pattern like the letter "S", below, would be encoded in NTSC like this
<br />(for simplicity of presentation, I reduced the clock of each signal by a ratio of 1/4, because for black&amp;white graphics, each 12-clock section of the signal is constant):
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.XXXXXX.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ░░▂▂▂▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▂▂▂░░&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;░░▂▂▂▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▂▂▂<br />XX....XX&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ░░▇▇▇▇▇▇▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▇▇▇▇▇▇░░&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;░▇▇▇▇▇▇▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▇▇▇▇▇▇░<br />XX......&nbsp; becomes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;░░▇▇▇▇▇▇▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂░░&nbsp; becomes&nbsp; ▇▇▇▇▇▇▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂░░<br />.XXXXXX.&nbsp; instead of&nbsp; ░░▂▂▂▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▂▂▂░░&nbsp; this:&nbsp; &nbsp; ░░▂▂▂▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▂▂▂<br />......XX&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ░░▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▆▆▆▆▆▆░░&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;░▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▇▇▇▇▇▇░<br />XX....XX&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ░░▇▇▇▇▇▇▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▆▆▆▆▆▆░░&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;▇▇▇▇▇▇▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▇▇▇▇▇▇░░<br />.XXXXXX.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ░░▂▂▂▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▂▂▂░░&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;░░▂▂▂▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▂▂▂</div>
<br />
<br />The television can decode the <em>type</em> of colors properly, because it syncs the phase within the colorburst section of the scanline. However, their positioning still appears to vary. But I can not understand why the positioning of brightness does not vary, i.e. why black&amp;white details do not seem to be subject to the pixel jittering.
<br />
<br />In order to determine the chroma and the luma in a particular position on the scanline, does the television not do the following?
<br />* For luma, calculate the total amplitude of last N of the signal (where N is exactly the wavelength of the chroma signal, i.e. 1/(3.579545 MHz) = about 279 nanoseconds)
<br />* For chroma, determine the phase difference between the colorburst signal and the last N of the signal (where N is as above)
<br />If not so, what does it do then?
<br />
<br />Does the TV somehow magically know how to compensate for the scanline shift phenomenon that it does not know about while still being unable to compensate it in case of chroma?

<br />Hmm... So let me get this straight.
<br />
<br />I'll use these simplified representations where the length of sync/black/pulse are irrelevant.
<br />
<br />A non-shifted scanline:<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; ::sync::&nbsp; &nbsp; :colorburst:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...colored pixels....&nbsp; &nbsp;white pixel.black pixel.&nbsp; &lt;-- NES intents to signal this<br />____SSSSSSSS____lllllhhhhhhl______hhhhllllllllhhhhllllllllhhhhhhhhhhhhllllllllllll<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Begin&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PIXEL-0-----PIXEL-1-----PIXEL-2-----PIXEL-3-----&nbsp; &lt;-- this is what the TV decodes</div><br /><br /><br />A shifted scanline:<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">__&nbsp; &nbsp; ::sync::&nbsp; &nbsp; :colorburst:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...colored pixels....&nbsp; &nbsp;white pixel.black pixel.<br />______SSSSSSSS____lllllhhhhhhl______hhhhllllllllhhhhllllllllhhhhhhhhhhhhllllllllllll<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Begin&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PIXEL-0-----PIXEL-1-----PIXEL-2-----PIXEL-3-----</div>
<br />So if the TV has all the required information to determine not only where the pixel begins and where the pixel ends, but also how the color data is to be decoded, where does the <em>visible</em> jittering come from? Who makes the error?

<br />Oh! Wow. New information. Thanks for the correction.
<br />Does not answer my question, though.
