<br />And instead of a header, lets call it a "manifest" that will always over ride the emulator database. Liker how Chrome apps/extensions have a manifest that says what permissions it needs and such. That'd maybe be a good idea to implement a "header" like file.

<br />
<br />
<br />I've been mostly keeping out of the thread, but I will interject here that I have been talking to Cowering about ines2.0 and getting it implemented in the GoodNES set.  We're working on getting this done;  I am waiting now for the new current set so I can go through and fix the headers that need it.
<br />
<br />So, in short, GoodNES WILL support fixing headers to the 2.0 spec if you so desire it to fix them.  
<br />
<br />This is the main reason I have not released a complete spec-  I am waiting on this update so I can make sure I have all the bases covered.

Whether we create a suitable replacement for IPS or not, the format will require new patch code.

<br />Guess you'll have to ask him then! That's 7 years worth of hacks and overdumps to add, plus changing to a format that won't work in most emulators, and some of the most popular emulators are dead.

<br />What I would give if the average emulation user cared about even 80% compatibility.
<br />
<br />If the 10-15 games the casual emulation user plays appears to be working, even with inaccurate sound and the occasional minor graphical glitches, then said emulator and ROM format is 100% perfect and accurate. Those 10-15 titles are always the most popular ones possible, so of course everything supports them: SMB1-3; Zelda 1,2; Contra 1,2; Megaman 1-6; Metroid.

<br />Trying to do anything for the ungrateful masses is a lost cause and a waste of time.

<br />Unfortunately, the more of them we can get to unwittingly preserve the system, the better. I always believed that you could have done better than 5th page on google search results. Each page you drop back is a huge decline. I am less optimistic about NES because there are so many more emulators, many of which are dead.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />iNES 2.0 was designed mainly to fill in the gaps for games that need CRC checks to determine specific mapper traits (like, MMC1 games that need 16K or 32K of WRAM).
<br />
<br />I designed it so that my FPGA NES BIOS does not need to keep such databases in its limited internal ROM.  The results have been pretty good for this.   Originally I did indeed have a database in it.
<br />
<br />It has not "caught on" yet because there hasn't been an official release yet, but slowly I am working on getting this done.  I need to go through all the ROMs and apply 2.0 headers to the games that need it.   I have done this but only for the older stuff, and all the Vs. system dumps I have made.  I suspect that around 50-80 ROMs will be affected and need the new headers.
<br />
<br />With the 2.0 headers, all the Vs. system details are right in it making playing them and emulating them easy  (No more PPU/etc selection required).
<br />
<br />I am not sure if 2.0 will catch on, but for me it's kind of a moot point.  It works here on my stuff which is the important bit.  If others would like to use it that would be great.  
<br />
<br />The main driving force behind it was to smooth out the rough edges on iNES and retain several (IMO) important advantages which were  backwards compatibility (though some emulators will "clean" the headers) and more important retain the ability to process stuff on a real live NES.
<br />
<br />If your new format cannot be read or used easily by a real NES then IMO it's a failure from the start.   I would like to see an NES decompress a zip file quickly or at all without extra help like a PIC or other CPU and gallons of RAM.  Even with the RAM I suspect decompression will be quite slow.
<br />
<br />It's not as if the complete set of ROMs won't fit on a modern CF/SD card many times over.
<br />
<br />Also, with this proposed zipped format, what's going to stop people from abusing it?  i.e. adding extra info to the zips such as text files proclaiming where it was downloaded from?
<br />
<br />What about larger "unlicensed", shall we say, games?  (Action 52 comes to mind here).  They have multiple PRG/CHR ROMs.  Will those be stored separate or unified?  If separate basically you will need many "Special case" loading modules and stuff to figure out what to do with three .PRG files.
<br />
<br />iNES has the advantage that the CHR/PRG are unified, making loading it and manipulating it relatively simple.  On the FPGA NES I just blindly load the entire chunk of PRG and CHR in first and then worry about banking it later.  This vastly simplifies the mappers and the loading code when everything has a single, unified structure.  
<br />
<br />And as a final thought, relying on some format that can be done via human intervention is going to be a load of fail.  What happens when people manually make these zip files, and use different conventions like all caps, all lower case, mixed case, unicode filenames, junk files (RIPPED BY DISKDUDE!!!.TXT), and other assorted trash in there?  Reading all that stuff on a PC is a headache, but doing it on some embedded system (NES, a PIC or other micro) is incredibly difficult and tedious, if it's even possible.
<br />
<br />So I guess in summation:  the KISS principle rules all at the end of the day, and "pony"* formats never seem to take off.
<br />
<br />(*pony as in, "I want this and that and a pony!")

<br />Funny thing is that this thread is all about homebrew, which your solution doesn't cover. Regardless of whether your format is accepted or not, that will mean nothing for Neil's problem of not getting emulators to recognize more than 8KB of SRAM for his homebrew program.

<br />Funny thing, isn't LHA still used as widely in Japan as ZIP is used everywhere else?

<br />blargg's File_Extractor library seems like an acceptable solution for reading these archives, except that no Linux or BSD distributions seem to want to supply it. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that it bundles libraries for all supported formats, rather than bothering to use system libraries for anything. Of course, zlib is the only system library it could reasonably use, unless there's some LZMA/2 library that isn't guaranteed to break API compatibility with every single release.
