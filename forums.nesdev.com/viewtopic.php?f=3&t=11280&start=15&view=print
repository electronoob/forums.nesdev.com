But I acknowledge that this would not work if you are trying to run an emulator on a platform that forbids copylefted software, such as if you are a video game publisher trying to make your classic games available for a modern video game console. I guess being under a permissive license is what helped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PocketNES#Commercial_use" class="postlink">PocketNES take off in Atlus, Jaleco, and Konami compilations</a>.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&gt; How long did it take you (and everyone else here) to make your first ever emulator? 1 day sounds pretty insane.<br /><br />I started with the SNES, and it took a few weeks to get some interesting demo games running, and around a month or two to get the first commercial game fully playable. For a long time I didn't emulate the APU, so I was patching out the APU wait loops in various titles for a while. I put a lot of emphasis on the debugger right away, so that probably stalled me a bit in getting stuff running, but helped later on.<br /><br />And it actually only took me half a day to get Super Mario Bros fully playable. I'm sure it was because I emulated the SNES first, and it's very much like a substantially souped up NES in design. Still it was somewhat disappointing how easy all of the 'tough' problems like sprite-zero hit and MMC5 turned out to be.<br /><br />The only real issue with the NES is the way the insane amount of mappers wears me down. I haven't yet found a way to organize all of that code nicely. Mapper#s are a bad system because the same board can use multiple #s. Board serials are a bad system because some boards lack serials. Lots of board variations exist that use the same MMC chip, but act somewhat differently in certain areas, and it's messy whether you combine or separate the logic for those.

But the behavior of the two configurations of the UNROM board is so different that it demands a different mapper number.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Lots of board variations exist that use the same MMC chip, but act somewhat differently in certain areas, and it's messy whether you combine or separate the logic for those.</div><br />At least with respect to identifying these variations, that's what NES 2.0 is supposed to fix. If you've found some NES or Famicom boards that don't have a proper technique to distinguish them, such as ROM or RAM size or submapper number, start a new thread and let me know. Or were you just talking about implementing these variations once already identified?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It definitely is a vague question. But for certain your level of experience is going to drastically impact how long it takes you. And then how much time per day you have to work on it.<br /><br />When I wrote my first emulator it took probably a week to go from nothing to something that could play some games. The slowest part in the beginning is writing that CPU core. It's also probably the biggest barrier to someone getting started. When you're working on emulating the CPU there is no really satisfying feedback. You are just looking at your debugger or logger executing instructions. Things are far more interesting and rewarding once you can see something happening. <br /><br />Once you've written an emulator for NES you could certainly crank one out in a day that would play alot of games.

When I was developing a 6502 simulator for a unit test framework, I felt rewarded just seeing the &quot;percentage of nestest completed with PC and CYC matching the Nintendulator log&quot; metric go up.

I think for alot of people if they are working on their first emulation project they don't really get much satisfaction until they see some real sign of a game running. Particularly because you can make mistakes with a CPU core if you don't have enough experience with that CPU. And the mistakes may not have obvious effects but could prevent you from getting things working.
