		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />(bear in mind i'm not the most technically minded individual here)
<br />Is there a limit to the wav size input/ dpcm size output? I've been messing around with that nice little "wav to dpcm converter" application (v1.0.0, 2004...), and i'm assuming it won't bother handling wavs that are too large for NES/nsf consumption. Although I don't know if this is actually true, just that it at least won't playback longer wavs and it crashes when trying to convert them.
<br />
<br />Of course the limitation would make sense for people using it for what it's really meant for, but i'm more interested in simply achieving that sound quality, whether or not it has anything to do with real NES limitations. Is there a similar program that would have no problem handling something like a 5 second long sample, or so? And one that could possibly output to wav that sounds like it is that quality? 
<br />
<br />I've recently been getting into sample based trackers (modplug), and while I probably should learn this whole NSF business soon, I have no concern atm about fitting within limitations as I am just about getting the general sound. And i'm totally loving this dpcm converter, but it would be even sweeter if it could handle bigger/longer samples. If that's doable.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Bucky, I've never had a problem opening full songs in the DPCM converter. Just so long as they are in wav file. The only way I know to get them back to wav files while still sounding like DPCM files is to open up an Audio Editing program and record the sound live as it is playing from the converter. 
<br />
<br />One thing I am a little unsure of, and perhaps some of you NES heads can enlighten me about, how do I get an optimal sound when converting to DPCM. Is there a certain volume level the wav file has to be, or something like that? My problem is this:
<br />
<br />When I record vocals into wav format, then use the DPCM converter, they usually come out completely as static. Sucks. I want it to sound like "BLADES OF STEEL!". That's the dream.

Given the prices of ROM during the NES's commercial era, no game could afford that much room for DPCM samples.

<br />Could you zip up your .wav files and send them to me so that I can look at them?

<br />It is the MML / MCK Beginners guide, but the ZIP listed there contains dmcconv005.zip. It is a DOS command line program that is pretty easy to use (there is info on how to use it near the end of that thread).

<br />Ah yeah, that's what I've been doing.  
<br />Only the DPCM converter never wanted play full songs for me. For a longer fill I wanted to sample from a new order song, I had to break it into several short wavs, convert them individually, and then piece them back together. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />

<br />A DPCM waveform can't be longer than about 32 Ksamples. If you're running at the highest sample rate, this is just under 1 second.

<br />Yes. Use 81 to convert it, and then look at the decomp.wav it spits out. Might it sound like <a href="http://pics.pineight.com/nes/backintheday.zip" class="postlink">this</a>?
