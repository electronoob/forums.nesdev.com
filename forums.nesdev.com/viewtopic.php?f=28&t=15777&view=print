I changed the epoxy blob for a flash and bang! Worked.<br />I had some very weird rendering issues, wich were surprisingly solved by disconnecting pins 14 and 28 from the bootleg DSP-1. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> <br />So far so good. I noticed it didn't have a save battery.<br />After adding a 16kb SRAM to the mix, using <a href="http://www.retrode.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/hirom_ramAccess.gif" class="postlink">this circuit</a> as reference I ended with this:<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

Won't I be continously losing the saves?<br /><br />Thanks in advance

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That strongly implies the RAM is <em>not</em> in low-power mode when you're testing.<br /><div class="quotetitle">Fisher wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I saw in some circuits a transistor on the SRAM's /CS pin but one showed it connected to /RESET pin and other to a specific MAD pin.<br />Is it really necessary? Won't I be continuously losing the saves?<br /></div>Oh. Yeah, that's why.<br /><br />It's necessary because otherwise the RAM will draw lots of power and use up all the energy in the battery quite quickly. When the SRAM's /CS pin is high (or +CS pin is low, if it's a RAM that has one), <em>it still retains the contents of memory</em>, it just doesn't draw as much power.

You rock!!! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />PS.: Is it me or this DSP-1 clone is finicky?<br />It took a while to start the game, all I was getting was the Nintendo logo and the boot sound.<br />At first I tought it was the clock generator, but them I found a broken track on the demux.<br />But even this wasn't enough to boot.<br /><br />Curiously, I added a LED to the DSP-1's /CS line and it booted!!<br />WEEEEIRD!! I played for a while and removed the LED. It stayed fine.<br />Other day I just melted the solder on the crystal's pins and it booted.<br />I also needed to cut 2 pins for it to render the graphics fine.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> <br />These pins seemed to be already cut from the begining, and I tought it was someone trying to fix it before me.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> <br />I'll just assemble it and don't touch!!
