<br />
<br />Unstable because it was 120VAC?  Or are you referring to 9.5-10 volts from his adapter?  Hardly "unstable" IMO
<br />
<br />You're certainly entitled to your opinion 80sFREAK, but for what it's worth martinpal80 I for one can't imagine the above sources of "instability" could reasonably cause the issues you're having.  And I would ignore his implied recommendation to replace all your electric appliances with gas ones <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Things like: only that NES, it takes several hours to fail, fails sooner if covered, fails later if case removed, fact it won't restart until it sits and cools down...
<br />
<br />Not a single one of those symptoms could reasonably be caused by what little instability there is in the supply power of your wall outlet.  They all point to an issue with heat...

<br />If you really do have an issue with power supply and the regulator and cap didn't fix it the only thing left I see is the diode bridge.  Go to half way through the second video to see where they're at and everything.
<br />
<br />Have you checked to see what the regulator's input and output were AFTER it had failed?  That might tell you whether or not you're wasting your time fixing a P/S that isn't failing.

<br />
<br />i guess you have to resolder whole pcb first. don't forget to use liquid neutral flux <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />If it froze (and you still have video) it can't be the power supply.  video would stop too.
<br />
<br />Sounds like one of the chips are bad.  Maybe the CPU (it gets the hottest).  If you have freeze spray or canned air (that you turn the can upside down) you can cool each chip to see if it works again when you cool them one at a time.
<br />
<br />i.e. reset,  &lt;nothing&gt;.  spray CPU.  reset again.  if it works, it was the CPU.  try with the other likely suspects. (74139,  RAM chip, PPU, 74368's in that order).  
<br />
<br />No guarantee it'd work but it's a decent way to go.  The other is to use a scope and poke the data/address busses to see if they are working, and make sure the 21MHz clock is running (though, if that were bad, when it froze the screen would go grey or black or white.  there would be NO colour at all since the burst would be missing).

<br />
<br />Use rosin-core solder.  Rosin is the flux.  If it doesn't say rosin core, and "no clean", specifically, make sure it says "for electronics".  There are solders for plumbing and other things that will ruin electronics.  I like Kester solder better than the Radioshack stuff, but any brand of the appropriate type will work.
