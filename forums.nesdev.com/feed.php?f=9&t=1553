lol not if I need to use those four pins.<br /><br />I guess it'd be okay to fold them outwards from the socket and solder wires on the tops, then put tape or something on the board to keep them from coming into contact with it.  It'd be better to use either 28-pin eeproms (and sockets) or a board with 32-pin chips, but I don't have either, and I'd hate to let it go to waste, even if it ends up looking a little sloppy when I'm done.  And if the MMC1 is dead (like I'm guessing it is), I figure I'll just direct-connect the address lines with jumper wires, and at least get an NROM board out of it.<br /><br />By the way, with these chips unsoldered, would it be possible to read them in like a Willem programmer without any modification?  I don't see any options for such a chip in the software of course, but I figure all those switches on the hardware might have a possible configuration to allow it.  It just didn't come with instructions for what they all meant!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=884">FyberOptic</a> — Fri Aug 25, 2006 10:25 pm</p><hr />

Good points, I forgot to mention that I used one of those cheap little dual-clamp things with the magnifier and such.  I tried putting extra solder on the power pin though, but it just wouldn't budge.  But the ground came out on the first try!<br /><br />Now the problem is trying to squeeze two 32-pin sockets into two 28-pin sets of holes.

Power/Ground pins are harder because they have a large plane for the board traces instead of a tiny wire.  That plane acts like a nice heat sink when you are trying to desolder.  Those pins are generally on the upper right and lower left of the chip, when the notch is at the top.<br /><br />For using the solder sucker I usually mount the board vertical in a clamp so I can have iron on one side and sucker on the other.  If it doesnt suck out all the solder on the first try it can help to reapply some fresh solder and try again.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=228">bunnyboy</a> — Fri Aug 25, 2006 1:06 pm</p><hr />

Welp, I just managed to remove the PRG chip from that Dragon Warrior board totally unscathed, board as well.  The secret?  Heating from the top, sucking from the bottom.  I know, that's probably a totally noobie suggestion, but that split second it takes to move the iron away and put the sucker in place when doing it all from the bottom is a lifetime in terms of solder staying molten.  Sometimes doing it from just the one side will work okay, or could take a few attempts, and other times it just won't.  I got every pin on the first try when heating from the top.<br /><br />Well, I still had an "asshole pin", but I'm coming to find out that generally these are power and/or ground pins, which from what I've read elsewhere, are possibly like that on purpose, and need more heat.  So I just held the iron on it till it got its typical level of mushy (since it doesn't seem to ever get thoroughly melted), then slid the chip out with a screwdriver.  An IC puller would surely have worked better, but I don't have one.<br /><br />The problem is that I probably would have never been able to do the heat-from-top method from the beginning, since the WRAM chip is so close to the other, and I have a lame soldering iron tip which is even-widthed, right down towards the very end, then suddenly goes to the fine tip.  It'd have never fit between the chips to heat the joints on those legs.  So I guess the biggest trick is just getting a soldering iron with a decent tip on it!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=884">FyberOptic</a> — Fri Aug 25, 2006 12:41 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, but when the whole pin falls off, it's pretty much impossible. And also, if you solder the pin back on, when you solder the chip into a board, the solder on that pin will melt when you get to it. It happens to me sometimes, when I'm soldering stuff together. If you touch a copper wire with the soldering iron, and the wire has solder at the end, the solder will melt, because the copper wire is so hot. The same rule applies for soldering pins back on to chips. Sorry, if that made no sense.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Fri Aug 25, 2006 11:27 am</p><hr />

I never could understand why some folks would cut legs and ruin the chips to get'em out, and now I know why.  I was trying to take the SRAM out of my dead Dragon Warrior today, and found it's nothing as easy to remove chips as I thought.  <br /><br />Granted, all I have is a push-button solder sucker, desoldering braid, and a soldering iron, which is probably not the best of tools.  But some of them came out rather well with the sucker.  Though you always end up with just a small few asshole ones which you can never suck out entirely.  I tried the braid on those repeatedly, but couldn't get it out.  I even re-soldered and repeated the above process, and still no good.<br /><br />Eventually I broke some of the pins by twisting'em from the bottom (the first couple by accident), and then was able to force the chip out.  The board is still in relatively decent shape, but unless I can put pins back on the SRAM (it's missing about 4), the whole thing was probably only good as a learning experience.<br /><br />I think I need to either get this Radio Shack desoldering iron, or try to find a set of snippers small enough to snip the legs.  I'm not sure where I'd even find the latter.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=884">FyberOptic</a> — Wed Aug 23, 2006 1:53 pm</p><hr />

I agree about the braid and pins.  I don't understand how it can be used easily to unsolder a chip.  Until I start doing hundreds of these, it's Radio Shack sucker for me.<br /><br />And yes, one suck usually does it, but I almost always do a quick two and then I hardly ever have to worry about a bitch pin.  With the second suck, I usually let the pin get in the hole and wiggle the pin so i know it's loose.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=231">sevast</a> — Fri May 26, 2006 11:12 pm</p><hr />

Radio Shack Sucker is the only one I have ever used.  It works great.  Doesnt burn the PCB if you do it correctly, and it usually gets the solder out on the first suck.
