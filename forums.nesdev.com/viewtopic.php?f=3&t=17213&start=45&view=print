For the few (mostly homebrew) games that allow selecting devices, this becomes a &quot;default&quot; input --- pick one, or don't and leave it at $00, letting the user decide in any case.</li></ul>Device-specific notes:<ul><li>&quot;Famicom controllers with Microphone&quot;: Use only if the microphone is actually used.</li><li>&quot;Vs. System&quot;: Used for both Unisystem and Dual.</li><li>&quot;Famicom Four Players Adapter&quot;: Use only if the games use the 3P and 4P controllers for independent input, not if they're just doubling 1P and 2P input.</li><li>&quot;Two Zappers&quot;: Becomes just &quot;Zapper&quot; if the user has only one mouse and does not use netplay. Even when emulating two Zappers, keep emulating 1P  controller (the $4016 bits do not overlap, after all) so that player may choose to use it as well.</li><li>&quot;Two Vaus Controllers plus Famicom Data Recorder&quot;: For <em>Arkanoid II</em>.</li><li>&quot;Double-Fisted&quot;: Used for <em>Crazy Climber</em> and <em>Smash TV</em>. Implies NES Four Score for <em>Smash TV</em>'s two-player double-fisted mode, which does not bother Crazy Climber.</li><li>&quot;R.O.B. Gyro Set&quot;: See what Nestopia does there.</li><li>&quot;Subor Keyboard&quot;: Implies Tape Recorder.</li><li>&quot;Generic multicart&quot;: Emulate this as &quot;Zapper in Famicom Expansion port&quot;, keeping 1P and 2P controllers attached. This value exists to signal to emulators so-inclined to detect the handful of common expansion-device-using multicart games, for example by comparing ROM strings involving controller read code, and auto-select the device for the selected game.</li></ul>ROM layout for Vs. Dual games:<ul><li>Most Vs. Dual games have unique 32 KiB PRG-ROM for each unit. Include both sequentially for 64 KiB of PRG-ROM.</li><li>If both units have the same CHR-ROM data, include it only once.</li><li><em>Vs. Mahjong</em> has 24 KiB of PRG-ROM for each unit. Include both sequentially for 48 KiB of PRG-ROM, mapping each 24 KiB to each CPU's $A000-$FFFF, keeping CPU $8000-$9FFF as open bus.</li><li><em>Vs. Raid on Bungeling Bay</em> has 32 KiB of PRG-ROM for the first unit, and 8 KiB of PRG-ROM for the second unit. Include the first 32 KiB, then the second unit's 8 KiB without padding to form 40 KiB of PRG-ROM, denoted by setting byte 9's LSB to $F and byte 4 to $36. Map the first unit's 32 KiB to CPU $8000-$FFFF, the second unit's 8 KiB to CPU $E000-$FFFF, and keep the second unit's CPU $8000-$DFFF as open bus.</li></ul><br />---<br />Obiter dictum: Note what I wrote about Playchoice 10 and Misc ROMs. The Extended Console Type now has values 0-2 identical to what Byte 7 bits 0-1 already specified for congruity. <s>I did not include a proposal for &gt;64 MiB ROM sizes: the only such ROM known to me is the <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0_Mapper_342" class="postlink">Coolgirl</a> homebrew multicart, which has 66.5 MiB and would be nasty to pad to a power of two, so I am still undecided on what to do with that.</s> <a href="http://symphoniae.com/nrs/nesdev/NintendulatorNRS2018-07-07.7z" class="postlink">Here</a> is my current Nintendulator-NRS build, which includes an updated Header Editor incorporating all aspects of this proposal including the new byte 9. (It does not actually emulate all those expansion devices, yet.)<br /><br />Edit: I have incorporated Rainwarrior's floating-point-ish proposal and modified the ROM layout description for <em>Vs. Raid on Bungeling Bay</em> to make use of it. This could also be used to contain Galaxian's 8 KiB of PRG-ROM without padding. Doing so would however break compatibility with existing emulators that would otherwise run the game, one of NES 2.0's stated goals. It's less of an issue for <em>Vs. Raid on Bungeling Bay</em> because no previous emulator runs the game from an iNES-format image anyway.

Differs from standard controllers in that &quot;start button 1/2/3/4&quot; are &quot;1P Select/1P Start/2P Select/2P Start&quot;.</div>This bit seems to contradict the wiki which says that 1 &amp; 3 are for player 1, and 2 &amp; 4 are for player 2.<br /><br />The only examples of arcades that I found in pictures were:<br />A) The DualSystem red tent - 1/2/3/4 are all together on the right side and don't really look like they are associated with either P1 or P2<br />B) A number of unisystem arcade cabinets which kind of look like &quot;1&quot; is P1's button, and &quot;2&quot; is P2 (which matches the wiki).  But these have no 3/4 buttons, and really 1/2 just look like they are meant to be used as 1/2 player mode selection at the start and nothing else.<br /><br />Emulation wise, it's &quot;easier&quot; to map the buttons to what the wiki says at the moment (1/3 = P1, 2/4 = P2), since that maps directly to the standard NES controllers.<br /><br />For the record, Nestopia uses these mappings:<br />1 = P1 Start, 3 = P1 Select (e.g same as wiki, but switches the select/start bits)<br />2 = P2 Start, 4 = P2 Select<br /><br />I don't really think there's a &quot;perfect&quot; way to map these, but I was about to commit my current changes/fixes w/ P1 as 1 &amp; 3 and P2 as 2 &amp; 4, which doesn't match the proposal, so I figured I should bring it up.

TKO: Game mode is selected via cursor and not decided by pressing which button.</div>In other words, &quot;Vs. System with reversed inputs&quot; reverses the D-Pad and B/A buttons but not the start/select buttons. Then everything neatly falls into place. Pretty much the only oddities are Sky Kid and Jajamaru wanting to start two-player mode with button 3, which they even call by that number, rather than with button 2. In any case, the proposal does not require implementing Vs. Controls in any particular way, only that there are two mappings, normal and reverse. It's probably best to present the user with the colors and button names that the games present, though.<br /><br />Edit: I have updated the Nintendulator-NRS build to support the new byte 9 as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since GoodNES' Vs. ROM images are useless for Vs. Dual games and don't have NES 2.0 headers for Unisystem games, I have made the attached batch file 'n headers to convert MAME's Vs. ROM sets to the NES 2.0 format according to the proposed specification. For games with odd ROM sizes, I am producing both padded and trimmed versions, the latter making use of the floating-pointish way of specifying the ROM size.
