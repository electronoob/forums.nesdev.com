		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Did someone tried Grond's Final Fantasy on real hardware ? I did it using the same methode as FF3. Game boot, music play fine, I can enter battles etc. but it's all garbage graphics and no readable text. At first I tought that was a problem with CHR-RAM. After checking the wiring for hours, everything seem to be fine. I then desoslder the Grond's FF PRG and Replace it with a FF3 PRG. Everything was FINE and playable. Do I need to do somenthing special to get Grond's FF working ?

If someone could test it in HIGAN and try to figure what's wrong with the hack. I don't think it's something big since the game is actually playing. <br /><br />EDIT:<br />It's like the wrong tileset gets selected ! Sometime, small parts of the screen display correctly but thats rare !!!<br /><br />EDIT #2:<br />After more testing using a debugger and looking at the active tileset while the game run, It looks likes the tiles are shiffted exactly by 8 lines Up or Down. On some rare occasion, on some screen, you will have a group of four lines on the tileset that will display perfectly but the rest will still be shifted. Its king of like the game is picking the tiles 8 lines to high or 8lines to low or the picking a tile 128 position to far.

The garbage is always the same, at the same place so I assumed it was not a initialisation problem. But it may still be that ?

The NES imposes some limitations on how VRAM can be accessed, but old/inaccurate emulators are quite forgiving and will allow access during times when the real hardware won't. Attempts to access VRAM during these times will most likely cause graphical corruption.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But it may still be that ?

This is probably minor: it should work sometimes and not work other times.<br /><br />The ROM hack does not obviously clear internal RAM... and I can use that to tickle a bug using Nintendulator: During the text fade in from the introduction, use a soft reset (F4): the screen turns green, goes to the main menu, and then I start getting subtle CHRRAM corruption. For some reason I can't tickle the same bug with Nestopia, though.

I mean that when I look at the pattern table in Nintendulator, the game seem to use a tile that is exactly 128 positions further in the grid than it should. It's true for every line in the table exept some lines that are used correctly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I wasn't talking about CHR-RAM initialisation (I'm pretty sure the game writes fresh data to it), but about RAM initialisation (that is CPU $000-$7ff).<br />Final Fantasy is very well known for NOT initializing RAM to zero, if the routine that loads tiles into CHR-RAM somehow repends on a state that was initialized obscurely by some other routine, I can see perfectly well the hackers changing it to save precious bytes, assuming RAM was initialized to $00 which is the case with 99.9% of emulators, including the most accurate ones like Nestopia, but in fact it's wrong on real hardware : The RAM is initialized mostly with $ff, with some bits randomly clear here and there.

People were using some Sony Sram chip that were initializing theme self at &quot;0&quot;s on power-up before someone make a patch that added RAM init routine. How hard would it be for someone the add that to this hack also ?.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My new version of NintendulatorDX (not yet released) has an option to randomize memory on power-on, but I couldn't get this hack to fail in the described way (garbage graphics). There are certainly problems with memory initialization though. For example, on some power-ons a garbage note will start playing on the other pulse channel.<br /><br />Also note that the current release version of NintendulatorDX doesn't log uninitialized accesses to the 6000-7FFF memory area.<br /><br />EDIT: This hack changes mapper from MMC1 to MMC3. My guess is that mapper initialization is not done correctly. Higan probably uses different default initialization values than other emulators. I've not added mapper initialization state randomization to NintendulatorDX, but I plan to do it at some point.

Most emus will initiate to this state, but Banshaku proved that the real hardware comes up with a different initial configuration, which have the effect to &quot;mirror&quot; tiles across the pattern tables instead of having a fresh 8k to work with.
