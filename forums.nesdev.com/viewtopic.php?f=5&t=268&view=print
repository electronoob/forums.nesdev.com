<br />
<br />Well, anyway, the reason I ask is because there are a lot of gameboy games that haven't had GBS rips yet, and I think deserve them. So, I decided I'd try to rip some myself, instead of waiting. I know assembly, but only 6502 assembly. However, the GB's z80 shouldn't be hard to learn. I've looked at the GBS spec, but I still don't fully understand it. Is there a tutorial, or a faq or something that can help me?
<br />
<br />Yeah, I know this is an NES hacking board, but come on, you can't tell me that NO ONE here knows anything about the gb as well... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I found a rip of TMNT, by Blargg, so I know there's still an occasional rip.
<br />
<br />In case your interested, I have a list of games I'm looking into, which includes:
<br />
<br />Gameboy Camera, all Game and Watch Galleries, Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle series, Motocross Maniacs 1 (simple tunes, but still catchy), and maybe more.
<br />
<br />The only kind of ripping I've done, relating to gameboy audio, is ripping the waveforms various games use for channel 3. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />Right now, my primary focus is on gameboy camera. I don't care about those other games right now, I mainly want gameboy camera. I think I've tracked down where the music routine is, because if I NOP out a jp at 7FF0, the music'll freeze, but the rest of the game works alright. I've having problems with NO$GMB though, because I have no idea how to switch which ROM bank is displayed in the debugger.
<br />
<br />Edit 2:
<br />Ok, so I went to the address of the JP, and found 4 calls. If I NOP out the first 3 calls, the sound effects stop working, and if I NOP out the 4th, the music stops working, so I think I found the play address. The problem is, the GBS spec is confusing... I looked at tetris and balloon kid's GBS header, and the addresses specified in the header are beyond the end of the file. Yet, somehow the gbs player still is able to play the file. Am I missing something?

<br />Perhaps the play address is in CPU-space, which is only 16 bits wide. Did you try ANDing the play address with 0x0000FFFF?

<br />
<br />I found something else...
<br />Right before those 4 calls is a conditional JP. If I NOP that out, the music does not change, whatsoever. I think I just found load... or init. Whichever one selects/loads a song.
<br />
<br />It seems as though everything music related is contained in a single bank... as there is not a single bank changing write in that entire bank. I may be wrong though, but it'd make sense if the music engine + music data was contained in a single bank.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Cool, nice to have a few new GBS albums. The GB Camera one sure has lots of tracks.
<br />
<br />BBC 2 and Garfield both jump to $FFFF after sound effects complete, which requires that my GB CPU core handle PC wrap-around. No other GBS files cause wrap-around, so it would be nice to continue to flag this with an assertion rather than have to emulate it. In one (I forget which) it looks like it's popping HL off the stack, then doing PCHL to jump to $FFFF. A solution might be as simple as putting the address of an infinite loop at that point on the stack in the init routine. I'll probably pull out the debugger and fix it if I get bored.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Really? I didn't notice that. o_O
<br />I did notice how the echo on the sound effects hangs after the sound effects end. I'll see what I can do. If I fix one, I can fix the other, because bbcc2 and garfield use the same engine.
<br />
<br />I don't really know how to look for something like that, so that's why I didn't catch it.
<br />
<br />Edit: Thank you for telling me this, I see that I accidently killed some code when I ripped the gbs, I forgot to rip a section. I'm going to duplicate the subroutine (very small subroutine) in the free space at the end of the bank.
<br />
<br />Edit 2: The hanging note was because I was using Meridian and that seems to just be a quirk. In an actual emulator, I saw what was happening: the sound effect would end, and the title screen music would start up again. I was able to locate the code I accidently cut out, and I readded it, and now the sound effect mutes when it's finished. All is well! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Now I just have to do this for Garfield...
<br />
<br />Edit 3: Fixed and uploaded! The links are the same. Let me know if the problem's still there, although now the music won't restart after a sound effect.
