I'm not sure on the '139 mapper boards, but according to the MAD-1 truth table thread, the only time the SRAM /CS is asserted low with /CART high is under the single following input combination:<br /><br />Mode = HiROM (MAD-1 pin 10 = 1)<br />A15 = 1<br />A20 = 1<br />A21 = 1<br />A22 = 0<br /><br />So, that could be problematic...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5348">qwertymodo</a> — Thu Jan 22, 2015 12:06 pm</p><hr />

So setting /CART high should have the same effect that setting /CS high on the chips does (in fact, setting /CART high should cause the address decoder to set all of the chip /CE pins high).  The chips all share the same bus on the cart, after all.

SRAM almost certainly would have caused issues under normal usage if they'd swapped it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I've heard of Nintendo swapping the /CS and /OE but have never seen any examples.

The RIGHT way to do it would be to have pin 23 on the cart edge connected directly to /OE on all of the chips on the cart, and pin 54 connected directly to /WE.  Then, you would connect each chip's /CE to the address decoder.  However, on a true mask ROM (or even an EEPROM that you never intend to program in-system), most will disable the output drivers if /CE is high.  If that's true, then you can just ground /CE or /OE (not both) and connect the other one up to the address decoder, and it doesn't matter which is which.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5348">qwertymodo</a> — Tue Jan 20, 2015 5:51 pm</p><hr />

Hey, I'm working on a Super System (arcade version SNES) and my question is:  what is the best method to isolate Xnumber of carts that are bussed together.....<br />On the super system, all the data, address, and control lines are bussed together.  There is a cart enable line that in effect &quot;turns on&quot; one cart and disables the others.  Using that same control line, is it sufficient to deactivate the carts by taking the /CE line (edge pin #23) high?<br />I'm messing with the SNES carts, not the super system cartridges.  So I am wanting to put a normal snes console cartridge into the NSS.  In doing so, I will need to be able to activate 1 cartridge and deactivate the other 2 (the NSS is a 3 cartridge system).  I know how the NSS handles the NSS cartridges but I'm unsure on how to handle the snes cartridges to fully deactivate them.  It seems that the /CE line deactivates the ROMS and the SRAM in the SNES carts -- which should allow a &quot;bussing&quot; of the carts so I guess I'm wanting to get confirmation if this is true or am I missing something.....<br />I assume that the console does need to control the CE line so I can't just pull it out of the system buss -- or can I? <br /><br />Thanks for any input!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5779">Markfrizb</a> — Tue Jan 20, 2015 12:34 pm</p><hr />
