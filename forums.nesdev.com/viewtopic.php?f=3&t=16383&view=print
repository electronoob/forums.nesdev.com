		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Recently I've spent some time improving support for HDNes' HD packs in Mesen (and adding a few features to the format along the way).<br />Up until now, that support was limited to graphic replacement, but with that mostly being done, I decided to give audio replacement a go, too.<br />HDNes has a tool to create conditions to instruct the emulator on when to replace music, but I figured making this flexible enough to work on all games would be a lot of work.  So I decided to go in another direction, similar to byuu's MSU1.<br /><br />This is what I came up with:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">switch(addr) {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;//Playback Options<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;//Bit 0: Loop BGM<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;//Bit 1-7: Unused, reserved - must be 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;case 0x4FF9: _oggMixer-&gt;SetPlaybackOptions(value); break;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;//Playback Control<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;//Bit 0: Toggle Pause/Resume (only affects BGM)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;//Bit 1: Stop BGM<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;//Bit 2: Stop all SFX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;//Bit 3-7: Unused, reserved - must be 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;case 0x4FFA: ProcessControlFlags(value); break;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;//BGM Volume: 0 = mute, 255 = max<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;//Also has an immediate effect on currently playing BGM<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;case 0x4FFB: _oggMixer-&gt;SetBgmVolume(value); break;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;//SFX Volume: 0 = mute, 255 = max<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;//Also has an immediate effect on all currently playing SFX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;case 0x4FFC: _oggMixer-&gt;SetSfxVolume(value); break;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;//Album number: 0-255 (Allows for up to 64k BGM and SFX tracks)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;//No immediate effect - only affects subsequent $4FFE/$4FFF writes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;case 0x4FFD: _album = value; break;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;//Play BGM track (0-255 = track number)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;//Stop the current BGM and starts a new track<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;case 0x4FFE: _trackError = PlayBgmTrack(value); break;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;//Play sound effect (0-255 = sfx number)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;//Plays a new sound effect (no limit to the number of simultaneous sound effects)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;case 0x4FFF: _trackError = PlaySfx(value); break;<br />}</div>Basically, it's implemented as a set of registers at $4FF9-$4FFF and it allows for 64k different bgm tracks, and 64k different sound effects (the &quot;album&quot; value acts as the MSB of a 16-bit track number)<br />Only 1 bgm (looped or not) can play at a time, along with any number of sound effects. The bgm can be paused, but not sound effects (maybe they should?)<br />BGM &amp; sound effect volume is independent, but all sound effects share the same volume setting.<br />Obviously the downside to this is that the game needs to be patched (IPS/BPS patches can be bundled with the audio files in Mesen's case).  The upside is that it can be made to work with pretty much any game.<br /><br />Does anyone see anything weird, missing or outright bad with this?<br />e.g:<br />-Mapper-wise, as far as I know, no major mapper uses this address range, I think?<br />-There is no seek capability, just play/pause/stop - I couldn't really find any scenarios where seeking would be useful, but I'm not a game dev.  Would it be useful to have?<br />-Does the API make sense from the point of view of someone coding a game in 6502 assembly? I did hack up SMB1 to use this and replaced a few BGMs and some sound effects in a short amount of time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRa9EPBd0os" class="postlink">(video)</a>. The fully disassembled &amp; commented version of the code definitely helped make this easy, though.<br />-Would using these registers on an actual cart make sense?<br /><br />I have no intention of actually designing a chip that would support this, but at the very least, I'd like to make it so that it would technically be possible to make one.

It'd have to be relocated from $20xx so as not to interfere with the PPU though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah, maybe I could add a toggle to select between $4xxx range and $5xxx range then - that should allow pretty much anything to work in one way or other.<br /><br />With the way I have things setup, the timer jingle already doesn't interrupt the music, but it doesn't speed it up either.  So you'd have to change the bgm track at the same time.  With the jingle covering the bgm for a split second though, it wouldn't really be that bad if the sped-up bgm track starts over from the start instead of trying to resume where the regular speed version left off, I think.<br /><br />The MSU1 doesn't actually support everything I am trying to do - as far as I can tell, it only supports playing 1 bgm at a time. So it doesn't seem like there's any way to use it for sound effects and the like?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />MSU1 games play sound effects through the S-SMP and S-DSP, just as with normal cartridge games. Games using the NES or Famicom version of MSU1 could play sound effects through the PSG, DMC, or expansion audio, and these sound effects could be more detailed because they no longer need to share bytes or cycles with music.<br /><br />At some point, you need to decide whether you're making a music player or a generic sampler. And this decision informs how you structure the storage for sound effects.

Other mappers are known to exist that use $4020--$43ff and $4500-$7ff. $44XX is <em>probably</em> clear. CopyNES puts its BIOS in $3XXX. <br /><br />Overlaying write-only ports on top of the mirrors of the PPU's read-only port (e.g. $2FFA) is probably one of the few guaranteed safe options.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Spent a few minutes searching through my code, and assuming it's not wrong, some mappers appear to map $4020-$FFFF entirely.<br />Using the PPU's read-only registers idea is clever, but having a register every 8 bytes feels like it might make them pretty hard to remember (e.g 3002, 300A, 3012, 301A, ...)<br /><br />If I exclude unlicensed mappers, though, it looks like $4100-$47FF is safe? Study Box maps to $4200-$43FF, but I'm not even sure that's a licensed product (and nobody would want to use this for that either way...)<br />I think I might just use $4100-$410X - avoiding overlap with licensed/homebrew mappers is my main objective.

(i.e. NINA-03/06)<br /><br />Since you're only talking about seven registers, you could pack them into the $F00s or $F0s nybble instead, e.g. $3xF2 or $3Fx2, so that the layout is easier to remember even though they're not contiguous.

(e.g due to the test/disabled registers from 4018 to 401A?)
