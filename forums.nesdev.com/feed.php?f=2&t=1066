Weren't you working on an implementation of RLE for this? RLE should work very well for this kind of map, where there is a lot of grass and such.<br /><br />I'm not much of a FF fan, so I don't know exactly how the maps are, but usually, in RPG's, there's are a lot of repeated patterns, such as trees, houses, mountains, bushes, etc, so you could pull a SMB here and have your maps object-based, instead of (meta)tile based. Like, if you have the object "house" defined somewhere in your ROM, you could define a house anywhere in a screen with only 2 bytes (one to identify the house and another one to define it's position within the screen with metatile precision), and that's pretty compact for me.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Aug 06, 2006 3:44 pm</p><hr />

I'm really sorry to bring up this really really old thread, but I need to figure something out, and it's about Final Fantasy's maps, so might as well not start another thread...<br /><br />I can't think of a way to:<br /><br />A. Arrange a 16x16 screen 2x2 metatile map in a 1 dimensional array.<br /> or<br />B. Compress data<br /><br /><br />I think this is really difficult, because there's so much data, and it has to be in a 1 dimensional array, and I have to worry about how much space I'm taking up. I really don't think I can afford to have the world map of a Final Fantasy game take up 64k of PRG! That's rediculous. If I can compress it well, then it'd be good.

Well, don't mind me, I was just beeing stupid these last few days.<br /><br />Yeah, if you decode the new screens as the last metatile of the current ones begin to scroll in you have quite some time to do the decompression. It may get a little complicated if the player decides to go back halfway through the decompression though.

Yeah, if you do it like you say it can work. You get that 8-pixel buffer by hiding the leftmost 8 pixels, right... As for scrolling vertically, your buffer is whatever the TV cuts off, certainly more than 8 pixels.<br /><br />It's just that even when I try to think "RPG" I end up thinking "platform", wich is what I think about all the time, and they scroll tipically faster than RPG's. You are right, at low speeds like 1 or 2 pixels per frame an 8-pixel buffer is enough to decode 2 screens in separate "sessions".<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Feb 07, 2006 4:20 pm</p><hr />

Sorry I didn't folllow you.<br />On a side note, being too slow when loading can cause problems for example if you are scrolling like on an airship in FF1, 4 pixels at time.<br /><br />Maybe you didn't mean sequencial like I meant. I think scince you have a buffer of 8 pixels, so 8 frames when scrolling 1 pixel at time, you can load a map in parallel with the programm that just scroll. Just save the pointers during decompression, and restore them the next frame. I see nothing impossible here.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Feb 07, 2006 2:03 pm</p><hr />

This is why a level coding scheme that allows random access to any rows or columns is good. However, the ammount of compression you can gain from such schemes is limited, and they result in maps with a certain ammount of repetition, not the case for RPG's.<br /><br />To be able to scroll freely, 4 screens must be loaded at all times. But everytime the camera crosses a screen boundary, horizontal or vertical, you have to load 2 new screens. A decompression routine that will output 240 or 256 metatiles/bytes per screen can eat a lot of time. Fortunately, RPG's do not scroll very fast, and a little delay might just go unnoticed.<br /><br />So, in the case of an RPG I'd go with the compression option. Maybe you can have each screen compressed independantly, and have an array of pointers, pointing to the place in memory where each screen starts, so you know where to decode each one from.<br /><br />But I'd agree with Bregalad. Try making your engine first, using an already decompressed map in WRAM. Do not worry about loading/unloading and compressing/decompressing screens yet. Just move the character around 4 screens directly placed in WRAM. When the engine works, figure out the storage and handling of the screens.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Feb 07, 2006 10:50 am</p><hr />

Please calm down.<br />What you need is map compression, not meatile format reduction. In the opposite way, the best way your metatiles are made, the more tiles you'll save.<br />I think you have to first worry about how to make a working map engine before worring about the copression.<br />For the world map, I have an idea of how to store a very-large map, while being compressed.<br />If will work like a lot of maps large of at least 16x15 metatiles (so the size of a NES' nametable, you could do larger if you want (like 16x16 to simplificate calculations)). Then, while scrolling, you'll have room in SRAM to store 4 different small maps at the same time. Then when scrolling, the programm will fastly switch the map in SRAM to scroll it when needed. So each maps can be compressed, and you don't need RAM for all your world map at the same time.<br />The problem is that your maps have to be internally loaded dynamicly, so this couldn't show a huge frezee as the player walks on the world maps at certains scroll lines. I think it should decompressiong from ROM to RAM should be done in less than 1 frame (or if needed a bit more than 1 single frame).<br />For all other maps of any RPG, I doubt they would overflow the size of 32x32 metatiles (so the size of 4 world maps parts). If they do, have a larger memory buffer in SRAM.<br /><br />About FFVII, you should programm the menu first I think, because it is a bit less tricky (while not being ideally much easier), and more game-specific. That will also force you to structure how to tidy items, materia, stats, etc... in memory.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Feb 07, 2006 10:16 am</p><hr />
