<br />
<br />If I get two 368's and connect them to the controller traces on one side and the data bus (I'm guessing on the data bus thing) on the other side, I'll have some unused pins.
<br />
<br />All of the unused pins get connected to +5V VCC (I have no idea what that is, by the way, but I'm guessing it's the opposite of ground and it'll be clearly marked on the PCB somewhere?) and all of the ones that do connect to controller pins need a resistor between the IC and the trace?  Or is the resistor attached to ground AND the IC?

<br />
<br />Yes, VCC is the opposite of GND.  It's the main power line pretty much.  GND is also called VSS, so watch out for that similar name.
<br />
<br />The resistors are connected to both the IC and VCC (not ground).  However for the unused pins, before hooking them up be sure they are inputs.  Connecting an output to VCC or GND would be bad, I'm not sure what that'd do exactly.  The sure way to check which pins are what, is with a chip datasheet.  There's actually one here on the site: <a href="http://nesdev.com/74HC_HCT368_CNV_2.pdf" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/74HC_HCT368_CNV_2.pdf</a>

<br />You'll know a lot more about electronics by the time you're finished with this repair job. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
