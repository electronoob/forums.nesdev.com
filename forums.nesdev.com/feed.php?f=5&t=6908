I think they're incredibly overrated. Sure, they had a huge impact on things, but the actual music isn't anything I really care for. I'm a pretty big fan of music from that era though, but I tend to lean more towards the 70's with bands like Fleetwood Mac (seriously, don't even talk smack about them or I will kill your face!).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat Oct 23, 2010 8:43 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, forget their early stuff, lots of that is just pop music suitable for little girls.  I don't know what stuff of theirs was commonly on the radio (I generally heard the full albums and seen the movies, since my mom had all of those).<br /><br />My mom actually had a short correspondence with Yoko Ono.  What's weird too is that I was born on Yoko's birthday, and my sister was born on John Lennon's birthday (Feb 18th and Oct 9th - not the same years, obviously).<br /><br />thefox: That sounds cool!  I really like the mix of pulse and FM-sounding instruments, that's something I'm hoping to achieve in my synth eventually.  Mine is much more primitive sounding at the moment, partly because it's made to be as CPU-efficient as possible, but more because I haven't put any work into the instruments yet..  But hey, I recorded a tune with it just for this thread:<br /><a href="http://membler-industries.com/squeedo/Squeedo%202010-08-27%20-%20Lady%20Madonna.mp3" class="postlink">http://membler-industries.com/squeedo/Squeedo%202010-08-27%20-%20Lady%20Madonna.mp3</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat Aug 28, 2010 4:25 pm</p><hr />

My mom used to play the oldies station pretty heavily when I was a kid, so I heard a lot of 'em, and I didn't like them even back then.  Combine that with a music teacher who taught them, and by taught them I mean made us listen to and learn facts about them, for half a school year and I can't really stand 'em.<br /><br />They were better in their later years, though. <br /><br />Also, I think a lot of electronic bands have been more influential on popular music, such as kraftwerk.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4250">Ian A</a> — Sat Aug 28, 2010 6:33 am</p><hr />

Personally I feel like they're overrated. Nostalgia probably has something to do with that.<br /><br />Sure, they influenced a lot of other bands (for better and for worse), and some of their more experimental stuff was pretty good. But it's not like they invented music. Many of their early songs are really quite cheesy (e.g. "She loves you", "I want to hold your hand", "It won't be long").<br /><br />Lennon seemed like a pretty nice guy though. I'm not so sure about McCartney.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1181">mic_</a> — Sat Aug 28, 2010 6:12 am</p><hr />
