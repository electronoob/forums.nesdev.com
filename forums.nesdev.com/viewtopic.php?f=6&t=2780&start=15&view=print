<br />
<br />Like I said - hence RSN. They use solid compression almost exclusively (well, any sane ones do), so yeah, repeated samples are taken care of. Unless of course a SNES game would use more than 4 MB of sample data, that's the limit of RAR dictionary size. But that didn't happen anywhere, did it?

<br />I don't always listen to music on a modern PC. Usually I'm on the bus, carrying what is essentially a gaming PDA with 4 MB of RAM and a 67 MHz ARM CPU.

<br />And you need to do a lot of seeking within tracks while riding the bus?

<br />Then i'd argue you hardly have the room for a logged format.
<br />As far as throwing my 2 cents into the fountain, i say that you can generate a logged version of game music from an NSF, but you can't go the other way around. Which obviates the need for a new format.
