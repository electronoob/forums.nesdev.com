		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Has anyone around here attempted to construct a GamePak jukebox similar to an M82?  I'm considering doing it as a step up to full-on custom cart development, plus to expand my knowledge about electronics.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.gamersgraveyard.com/repository/nes/history/demo_unit.html" class="postlink">M82 Demo Unit</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.atarihq.com/tsr/odd/scans/demounit.html" class="postlink">Older demo unit</a>
<br />
<br />
<br /><strong>Concept</strong>
<br />The concept I've been kicking around would involve having 7 or so standard cartridges (unmodified) plug into a single backplane.  All 72 pins from that backplane would plug into a ribbon that leads into an "adapter" cart.  Said cart would be a simple UNROM that uses a mapper-like latch to switch power to any one of the carts on the backplane.
<br />
<br />The program for the adapter cart would be pretty simple.  Just a menu for selecting which game, with maybe some music.  Could easily be done inside a few K so an UNROM layout would work great.  
<br />
<br />After selecting a game, the NES is locked into that game until you hit reset, as the goal here is to not customize all the carts in the jukebox.
<br />
<br /><strong>Decoder/Latch</strong>
<br />
<br />I'm thinking about using an 3 to 8 decoder/latch to provide the switching, which will be writable at $Fxxx - by ANDing the high address lines.  The individual outputs will switch power to the various carts on the backplane. If it works, it could easily be expanded to bigger decoder for more games to be plugged into the "jukebox".
<br />
<br /><strong>What Now?</strong>
<br />Where I'm getting stuck, planning wise, is how to simulate a reset in software after I've written to the latch. The adapter cart itself would have its power switched at latch #0 (so the menu is running at power-on), so I would loose power to its PRG ROM and CHR ROM the instant that write is complete.  
<br />
<br />I think I can get away with doing this, but I have no clue if it will work:
<br />
<br />- Copy 'reset' code (the following bits) to RAM, and JMP to it.
<br />- Turn off interrupts, sound and display
<br />- Write cart number to the decoder/latch's mapped address space (PRG and CHR go offline for a bit)
<br />- Wait for a few milliseconds (for good measure) while the latch and transistors re-route power
<br />- clear display memory and re-enable display (not sure about this step)
<br />- JMP to program start in the new cartridge ($8000?)
<br />
<br />At the point of that last jump we've effectively <em>bankswitched an entire cartridge</em> onto the PRG and CHR lines.  The cart won't know what hit it, and neither will the console - in theory at least.
<br />
<br />Any ideas, critiques and circuit layouts would be welcome.

<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; sei<br />&nbsp; sta latchAddr<br />&nbsp; ldx #$FD<br />&nbsp; txs&nbsp; ; normal power-on state of stack pointer<br />&nbsp; jmp &#40;$FFFC&#41;&nbsp; ; 6502 reset vector<br /></div>
<br />Some more buggy games may require that most of RAM be cleared to $FF values, so load this trampoline into upper stack space ($01C0-$01FF).
<br />
<br />And would your menu cart use the first cart's lockout chip? And how would you (cleanly) make the latch disappear from the bus as soon as it is written to once?

<br />
<br />Maybe I'm just crazy, but I'd want the thing fully powered (externally) and possibly under control so the program could select any cart whenever it wants.  That'd be a hell of a hardware expansion usable by whatever fits in the NES's internal 2kB of RAM (well, depending on what carts are connected anyways, getting to be like a PC with infinite hardware configs).
<br />
<br />Also, with just cutting off the power of a cart to disable it (or just ICs in general), is that safe to do electrically?  I was wondering about that for some other designs.  Since the inputs would be getting voltage while VCC and GND are both 0V, a lot of chips will say things like max VCC+0.6V.  It makes the voltage difference sound unsafe, but I don't know.

<br />
<br />Good point.  You wouldn't want any given cart tripping over the latch during gameplay.
<br />
<br />I was thinking about setting the enable line of the latch to be a logical AND of whatever address lines its mapped to AND NOT the OR all of the output latch lines.  This way, it'll disable itself once the decoder is set to something other than zero, making it a one-shot deal.
<br />
<br />Latch Logic 'pseudocode' (since I can't draw a decent schematic here):
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">latchWriteEnable = &#40;A15 &amp; A14 &amp; A13 &amp; A12&#41; &amp; !&#40;Y0 | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 ... Yn&#41;</div>
<br />
<br />Where Y0..Yn are the decoded outputs of the latch, and A15..A12 are the most significant address lines on the NES PRG bus ($Fxxx mapping).
<br />
<br />I haven't breadboarded this yet, but I don't see why it wouldn't work.

<br />
<br />Oh, I see: logic typically runs closer to +1.0V, so that's almost double what the rated input would be.  I was hoping that as long as the chips in question had a proper ground, it could tolerate the situation.   
<br />
<br />And I suppose under-running all the 'dormant' games at VCC+0.5V, or reducing logic to the same would be just as bad.  So using active logic for *each cart* might be the only way to go - so much for keeping it simple. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />Given that probably nobody reading this has access to an M82 demo unit, does anyone here know how the Game Genie handles this for one cartridge?  (I'd dismantle one myself if I owned one)
<br />
<br />Edit: fixed link and spelling.

<br />
<br />Sorry, but that's no good. The pin pitch is listed as 0.125" (3.18mm), which is WAY too wide for an NES cartridge, whose pitch is 2.50mm.
<br />
<br />They do have a 60-pin cart edge connector which has 0.100" (2.54mm) pitch, the correct spacing for a Famicom cartridge. However, it is designed for board thicknesses between 0.054" and 0.070"; Famicom cartridge boards are 0.043" thick, so they would fit extremely loosely and might not make consistent contact.

<br />Q is very right on this, I learned the hard way.  Look for some of my old topics if you want details on the fiasco I had getting 72 pin connectors.  I have resorted to buying the "U" shaped replacement connectors off ebay, and doing some serious re-work on them with a Dremel.  This produces a very usable connector, but is a lot of work, and mechanically not as nice as a vertically mounted card edge connector would be.  If only I could figure out where the clone makers like Messiah get their parts.  A call to their office revealed that they have no idea... the device is designed and manufactured in Asia, the guys in LA know almost nothing about it.

My mistake here was assuming that the NES pin pitch was something close to an already established standard - boy was I wrong.  I dug around on the board here and it seems those connectors are hard to come by.

<br />
<br />So I need to find a 2.5mm pitch connector, 72 pins, that will seat a 0.043" board.  I did find <a href="http://www.lumberg.com/Produkte/PDFs/2_5.pdf" class="postlink">this incredibly close match</a> but it seems to be too wide for a good contact.  Also, I can't find any distributors for that part anyway - I put in an inquiry for a discrete order just for grins.
<br />
<br />Somehow, cutting down replacement toaster-NES connectors seems like the only way forward, as was mentioned... elsewhere (can't remember where though)*.
<br />

Thanks for all this wonderful info - its tough to find this stuff out elsewhere.  After reading the spec sheet, it's very clear to me now.<br /><br />So now I see where you're going with this.  The "bus transceiver" has a bona-fide "off" state - that should guard the cartridge circuitry nicely when coupled with the master latch.  <br /><br />Also, the chip count for this beast is starting to rise exponentally.  I'm starting to see why you were imagining an external power source to go with this.  Still, with only driving power to one cart at at time, how much of a drain do you think all these extra chips will cause?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Just copy the code into RAM, and run it from there.

<br />
<br />"Cartswitching" - I like the sound of that.  That's pretty much what I'm trying to design.

<br />You could try replacing all those chips with a programmable logic device.  CPLD's are pretty cheap and would probably do.  I've been working with FPGA's more, but the design is almost the same for either.

<br />
<br />two 16bit address busses + two 8bit data busses = 48 lines.
<br />
<br />So double that and we get 96 total just for bridging all the I/O.  This application will need another dozen or so for good measure...  So we're looking at a 100+pin chip of some kind.
<br />
<br />Edit: Apparently, I can't add. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok so i know this is an old thread but i want to bring life back into it with a new project i have embarked on and to now have yet to fail but yeaterday i hit a critical point int he project where i needed to get to a point to find out if my theory was correct and of course it was not so now im stuck. 
<br />
<br />I started with my old nes dissasembled and some 24 gauge copper wire
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/01.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/07.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/08.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />next i took my power/reset board and examined it to see what i needed to do 
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/02.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />i decided i wanted to have a remote power/reset button and other features.
<br />so i soldered 4 wires 2 to each switch for now
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/05.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />since i am going to be porting out about 10-20 wires i decided to use an already implemented connection. I used a parallel printer cable jack. I wanted it in the front of the nes but not over the buttons or the controller ports so it had to go in the center but its length would not fit because of the center peg for the bottom screw holding the top on. not wanting to hurt the integrity of the case i opted to turn the jack sideways.
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/03.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/04.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />this next image shows everything in place with connections made
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/06.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />next i decided to diable the lockout chip. i was originally going to connect pin 4 of the cic lockout chip to a ground but in desoldering it i broke it off which is ok unless you plan to play gold games such as zelda whcih i just have hated all my life with a passion and i dont know why.

<br />
<br />your soldering iron is the best friend in a project like this so invest in something that will be with you in the long run i use a digital soldering station with ground termination for the equipment your working on you know you dont want to kill any components. components run at minimal voltage &lt;6volts and any static can damage IC's and other parts.
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/11.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />after a while your sponge may become lost or too dirty then i would suggest buying some o-cello sponges from your local dollar store and cut one to fit your tray
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/12.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />my extra hands help out in some situations
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/15.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />my fan helps suck the dangerous fumes away when soldering
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/16.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />there are alot of wires your dealing with here so pay attention and dont mix them up. remeber 72 pins minus the expansion ports leaves alot of wires. the wire im using was a bulk phone company wire with 50 wires inside so chopped off two 2 foot sections and used them. as for the soldering you get the idea in the next few pictures
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/14.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/18.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/19.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/20.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />now i was planning on soldering 8 connectors to the main feed so about 65 wires in a series all connected except for pin 36 which is +5v for the nes cart. my theory was that cutting power would stop interferences from the other game carts. well i had to get the main connector and two more connectors on in order to test this. once i was done i tested it.
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/21.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/22.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/23.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />so i power on my nes with mario bros 3 and donkey kong plugged in power only to mario and it looks fine at first but notice the bottom of the screen there are a series of m's and other characters
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/24.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />then when the title screen shows up its all messed up
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/25.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />so i power off remove donkey kong and power back on and voila its back to normal
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/26.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/27.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />so i dont know what to do next in my quest to run 8 games in a solely hardware switched system
