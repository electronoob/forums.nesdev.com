<br />Snaps of the intro, slightly trimmed for screenspace constraints. Especially that last one - if it's any longer, the game crashes.

<br />This is pretty much the first string in the first block. It's probably the first thing you see once the mysterious robots destroy your shuttle, and it was also used as test fodder.
<br />
<br />More snaps forthcoming as the edit progresses.

<br />
<br />LP's claim to fame is Konami's VRC7 mapper and heretofore intractable text. Most folks here, I think, are familiar with both the game and my <a href="http://agtp.romhack.net/" class="postlink">translation group.</a> I've got another thread further down the forum advertising translations for Madara and Esper Dream 2, both VRC6 games. (Although since AGTP got a redesign recently, the screenshot links are broken.)

<br />Did you know that sound retarded, even to me ? Just to informate you, because Lagrange Point is a well-known japan only game any NES-developper should have tried at least once for it's very unique sound chip on the cartridge.
<br />You should at least have heard about the NSF.

<br />Why don't you kiss my butt, Bregalad? It was an honest question, it was an honest mistake, and what's more, if I had posted something like that (<a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=2872" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=2872</a>), then everybody would be on at me right now. I've not heard of it before, and the doesn't make me a retard. No doubt everyone's gonna be on at me now for even this post...

<br />Actually, "kiss my butt" aside, I agree with you. No one has the obligation to know every NES game, specially one not released in their region, and in a language they don't understand.
<br />
<br />I have heard of this game before, but only very recently. People here were talking about it's music, so I went to check it out. But if it weren't for that, I'd have no idea what "Lagrange Point" was.
<br />
<br />When in doubt, I usually do a quick google search, though, and that usually clears things up.

The only problem I see is that the Pattern Table viewer of an emulator may only show the top/bottom scanline's pattern tables, but FCEUXD can let you pick any scanline to view them on.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The Japanese script was compressed; each character was packed into six bits instead of eight, allowing for a maximum of 64 unique byte-values. Special controls included line break, section break, end-of-string, three dictionary print blocks (each of 64 entries) and a font switcher to print katakana instead of hiragana. This is what prevented most people from working on the game :/ Necrosaro managed to extract the script, and I've since had the compression broken; it's now loading raw values with DTE+dictionary compression for a ratio of 44% - much better than the bitpacker routine could have gotten me.

However, you're supposed to use your brain a bit and do a quick GameFaqs search, wich usually told you if a game exists or not (even if sometimes it's spell differently, I never encountered a existant game that isn't on GameFaqs database).
<br />
<br />Of course I've heard of Lagrange Point for nothing that it's music (and it's also one of the two knowns FC games to ever use CHR-RAM bankswitching (along with Romancia) and to use the VRC7 (along with Tiny Toons Adventures II) ).

<br />
<br />Romancia and Lagrance Point have just 8kb of CHRRAM, so normally it has no real reason to be bankswitched, but it is. That's pretty much what I meant. They switch smaller banks among the main 8kb.
