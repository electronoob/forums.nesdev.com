I thought it was implied that the background tiles were now being used.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">My preference would be to have the cursers on there own chr page, cause I want as many tiles as I can manage for my back ground graphics.</div><br />Then use lidnariq's. I could maybe mess with his, but honestly I'm pretty sure you could condense four or however many tiles you need for the cursor if you end up with exactly 256 for your background. In fact, I bet the time it'd take you to do so would be less than the time it'd take me to change this. And it is your project!

You just seemed to be ok with continuing with what I was asking. I'm not trying to be impolite. I'll take what's here and run with it if you are content with stopping here. Again thank you. You are a gentleman and scholar.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I spent too much time worrying about how to to it the right way such that I completely dropped it. Bleh.<br /><br />Anyway, I just cribbed Kasumi's animation code and stuck it in mine, so you can have an animated cursor but no transition animations. I added the ability to move the sprite at the same time as the tile changes.<br /><br />If you want to use an 8x16 sprite, you can enable that too-- I added a comment about it, just search for &quot;8x16&quot;. (Be careful: if you do, the tile numbers get a little weird. Even numbers are from first half of the tiles, odd from the last half.)

What does this line do anyway? <br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;.incbin &quot;vegaplay.nes.chr&quot;</div><br /><br />I'm assuming it is loading the .chr file? Because I changed it to &quot;geo.chr&quot; and things seem to work, but I wanted to ask anyway just incase it's something else.<br /><br /> I really like the addition AnimationH and V. I could use them to make the curser bounce or orbit slightly. Real cool!
