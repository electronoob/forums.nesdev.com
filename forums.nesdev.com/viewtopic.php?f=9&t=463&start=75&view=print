<br />Sure, all of those can be implemented (and some are by now).
<br />
<br />***EDIT***
<br />The first mapper has been burned thru the USB interface! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />I modified the board a little, it has the USB cable combined in it now and it has a place for a real lockout chip and for different versions/packages of the battery backup chip, (DS1210/DS1218/DS1218S),.
<br />
<br />Also the new board won't support burning the game while it is connected to the nes (it really did not work that well, so i abandoned it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />)

<br />Funny, because I always get my samples from there.
<br />Well, the new board will accept a DIP DS1210 and a DIP DS1218 too.
<br />
<br />I burned one I/O-pin from the CPLD and now waiting for some new chips to come, they ship on the middle of october <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /> ..

<br />
<br />Well, the 256Mb EFA can, on average, store about 4 games at a time, and games transfer extremely fast.  I am still eagerly awaiting the FunkyFlash.  I think that artoh should go into mass production once he is done.  Screw the kit idea.  He should have pictures of Euros in his head.

Of course, the CPLD would have to be re-programmed if the game uses different mappers each time a new game on the cart is selected.

<br />Not much. Waiting for some new boards to come from the factory...
<br />Been busy with my studies. Basically only the PC software needs to be improved. And there is still no MMC1...

<br />I started on a MMC1 implementation using schematic capture a while back (Altera tools).  It's not working yet, and other than simulation I have no way of testing it.  I was hoping to convert it to VHDL so it would be easier to share.  I would say it's about 90% through the initial creation.... which means there's still a lot to do, but if you're interested I'm more than willing to help.  Your project overlaps quite a bit with what I've been doing, so having something in common would be great.  I'm pretty sure the Xilinux Webpack (or whatever they call it) is free, so I could probably convert it pretty easily.

This device has roughly 120 pins, which means up to 120 possible mistakes with pin-point soldering.  It simply won't do for almost anybody.  Its tricky enough modding SNES consoles for a 50/60Hz switch and region free and that only requires desoldering and lifting three pins.

<br />I love the logo etched into the PCB.  Membler's apparently already has a kit.  I hope it works for him, so that we have a source for pre-built carts.  The masses will only be able to enjoy this if they can buy a pre-built unit.

If there is any assistance I can offer, please let me know.  As much as anybody, I've been waiting for one of these devices to hit the market, so I'm definitely ready to give the cash for a finished unit...I wish I could contribute more to make things a go, though.

<br />THat kind of soldering is difficult for even very experienced solderers.
