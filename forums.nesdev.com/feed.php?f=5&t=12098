Anyone with a sense of ethics would produce a repro cart that overtly distinguishes itself from the original, like Retrousb carts with translucent colored shells.  Even if you made a cart for your own use, writing &quot;repro&quot; on the shell somewhere wouldn't kill it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3506">strat</a> — Sun Dec 07, 2014 4:53 pm</p><hr />

Guys, this is not supposed to be fraud or anything illegal or scamming people at all. The idea is supposed to be something of a sort of funny prank hidden camera show. <br /><br />The purpose is just to test peoples reactions. Would the employee try take the game for themselves or will they tell the seller what its really worth? That's it! No real money being exchanged, its a hidden camera show idea to test peoples reactions that's all. <br /><br />Yes, there are people who really do try and sell repos as originals which is wrong, but this is NOT what I'm talking about.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6785">Erockbrox</a> — Thu Dec 04, 2014 5:21 pm</p><hr />

What you do is try and make it look as authentic as possible. Wear out the label a little so to speak. Make it look old and make the reproduction cartridge Nintendo World Championships gold version which is worth like $50,000 fifty thousand dollars. But again mix it with a bunch of other games and pretend that you don't know anything about games but are just looking to trade in.<br /><br />The employee of the store maybe so shocked and that its worth so much money that they might try and just take it and throw it under the counter. Or again say, oh I'll give you $30 bucks for the whole box. <br /><br />The whole point is that you just want to see what they would do. Would you personally try and keep it or tell the person they just won the NES lotto!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6785">Erockbrox</a> — Wed Dec 03, 2014 11:52 pm</p><hr />
