<br />Why is it seen as so impossible to redesign this logic ourselves???

<br />
<br />It isn't seen as impossible, just hard/expensive with no big benefit.  And redesigning it doesn't need an exact copy so the knowledge already contained in emulators is almost certainly enough.  Decap would just get the precise logic, which could probably be figured out with other tools like logic analyzer instead.

<br />Kevtris' console shows its not impossible, but he did cheat with hooks into the NES PPU  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Yeah that was kinda what I was thinking.  I guess the point I was trying to make was cracking the secrets of the MMC5 isn't the only option for us to gain these features.  That's what most people seem to believe.  It's simpler, cheaper, and less uncertainty for us to just re-design logic to provide similar features  to what the MMC5 has.  There's no point to crack it open, just design something for ourselves...  Especially if you're looking to create a game that you'd like to produce.
