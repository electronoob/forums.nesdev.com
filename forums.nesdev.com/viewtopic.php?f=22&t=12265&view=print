		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, it's been a while.<br /><br />Last year I had difficulties progressing with Auge so I decided to put it on hiatus.<br /><br />Since then I've been working on Nim &amp; Nom, a Platformer/Collect-a-thon. There is still a lot of work to be done but it's now at a playable stage. <br />There's only four stages in the demo.<br /><br />Any feedback is appreciated.<br />I hope you enjoy the demo.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=12265&amp;start=15#p183382" class="postlink">Update - 25/11/2016</a><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Update - 14/2/2015<br /><br />Thank you, again, for all the feedback everyone.<br /><br />I didn't have many chances this past fortnight to work on Nim &amp; Nom, So I couldn't get everything I had planned done. Most of the work done wont be noticeable as I needed to rewrite some of the routines and spent most my of time with that.<br />I wasn't able to create any new stages, so the game is mostly the same as the last update. There is a level at the end that wasn't in the previous version, but that was being used to test sprite and is not a proper level.<br />I'm hoping I'll get more time to work on Nim &amp; Nom in the following weeks. There's still so much work to be done.<br /><br />Tweaks:<br />- Flies will no longer stun the player, instead, they can be pushed around.<br />- The select button can now be used to navigate the menus.<br />- The player's max run speed has been reduced from 32 to 28.<br />- The height of the player's hitbox has been increased by 2 pixels.<br />- The vertical boost given by bubbles has been increased by 7.<br />- Rearranged the title screen.<br />- Springs now bounce the player even higher if the jump button is pressed as the player lands on one. It will also add a breif moment of invincibility.<br />- When hit by an enemy, the player will get knocked back in the direction it is moving, instead of the opposite direction the player is facing.<br /><br />Added:<br />- There is now a 4 frame window for the player's input to take affect.<br />- Sprites will now create a splash when landing in water.<br />- The player can now be seen while underwater.<br />- Pressing start on the second controller will skip the current stage and load the next. This is only temporary and I decided to leave it in because there are no new stages.

Okay, I've now beaten it.<br /><br />The rain moves a little fast for me, it kinda feels like random static. Like, I can see the shape of the rain moving if I pay attention (or step frame by frame) but while playing there is too much distance between frames for me to see it as motion. Of course, if it was slower it might feel too coherent, and start to feel like a scrolling sheet instead of rain... so, I dunno. In my own game I added some random drift to the rain particles, to give a turbulent feeling.<br /><br />Your OAM cycling technique is interesting. It looks like you shift your starting position in your OAM buffer each frame to mix up the draw order? I've heard you can accomplish the same thing by just writing a non-zero value to $2003 before your OAM DMA, though I haven't tried that method. Might be simpler? More advanced, you could randomize the order you draw chracters in, which would let you control priority where necessary, for instance you could always draw the rain last to prevent it from causing flicker of other sprites.

In the last stage of <em>Street Fighter 2010</em>, the player is supposed to fight five bosses on one health bar and one timer, which forces the player to get every single step of every single stage perfect in order to find the one path through the five bosses that collects every power-up while running out of neither of the player's two resources (health nor time).

Sadly with the way the weather currently works, I don't get much freedom so there isn't much more I can do without rewriting the code. Once I have completed the remaining systems for the game I'll have a more thorough look at it and see if there is anything I can do to improve the visuals so it doesn't seem so random.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Your OAM cycling technique is interesting.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had a chance to load this onto my Everdrive, and just wanted to say it looks great! The art style looks wonderful (character design is cute and full of personality, and the environments have great depth, lighting and detail) and the play mechanics are simple yet challenging. The rain effect looked excellent to me playing on my CRT. <br /><br />Some notes:<br /> - The sprite wrap around seemed odd. Being able to walk from the right of the screen and appear on the left took me out of the experience somehow. Maybe have a hovering teleporter or portal in the air instead?<br />- The bounce controls on the springs took me a few minutes to figure out. You have to HOLD the jump button? Why not make it like in SMB where you jump WITH the bounce of the spring?<br />- Game title would be nice near the top of the screen.<br />- Cycling through the custom palettes was a bit hard to see on the CRT. Maybe include a larger color block next to the character so you can see what color you're on, or have a value displayed (&quot;color 1, 2, 3&quot; or &quot;red, yellow, lime&quot; etc)? I think because the character is small it makes the palette changes less noticeable. Not a big deal though.<br />- Maybe include two modes: Regular and Survival. The current game is like &quot;Survival&quot; mode in Street Fighter II, where your health is never fully restored. Just an option between two modes would be nice.<br /><br />This game seems very modern, like it would make a good app game.

They could be like the equivalent of bonus points (or in this case extra time/life).

Only allow user to press jump during a short window of time before the bounce.<br /><br />If the goal is to make it easy to bounce, use 1. If your goal is to make it difficult to bounce, use 2. Either could be a valid design decision, but if you're going to make it difficult to bounce on springs, you should at least justify it by making that difficulty part of the fun. I don't think that applies in this particular case.

You could continuously hold Down or Up (rather than 'A') to do the current bounce, but you could also press 'A' (jump button) while springing to spring higher like in SMB/SMB3. Holding Up seems intuitive enough, I would hope.<br /><br />And haven't enough people grown up with SMB and SMB3? What would be so foreign about treating the springs in NimNom the same way?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Bah, halfway through writing my reply, my internet disconnects and I lose it. Oh well, sorry about the post being messy, I'm still unsure of the best way to reply to everything and have it look neat.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">psc wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I had a chance to load this onto my Everdrive, and just wanted to say it looks great! The art style looks wonderful (character design is cute and full of personality, and the environments have great depth, lighting and detail) and the play mechanics are simple yet challenging. The rain effect looked excellent to me playing on my CRT. </div><br />Thanks, I'm glad to here that as I have no way of testing Nim &amp; Nom on an actual NES and have been concerned about how it may look on a CRT.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> - The sprite wrap around seemed odd. Being able to walk from the right of the screen and appear on the left took me out of the experience somehow. Maybe have a hovering teleporter or portal in the air instead?<br />- The bounce controls on the springs took me a few minutes to figure out. You have to HOLD the jump button? Why not make it like in SMB where you jump WITH the bounce of the spring?<br />- Game title would be nice near the top of the screen.<br />- Cycling through the custom palettes was a bit hard to see on the CRT. Maybe include a larger color block next to the character so you can see what color you're on, or have a value displayed (&quot;color 1, 2, 3&quot; or &quot;red, yellow, lime&quot; etc)? I think because the character is small it makes the palette changes less noticeable. Not a big deal though.<br />- Maybe include two modes: Regular and Survival. The current game is like &quot;Survival&quot; mode in Street Fighter II, where your health is never fully restored. Just an option between two modes would be nice.</div><br />- Hmm, I don't really have room to do something like that. Maybe it wont feel weird with levels that a designed to work with it, I haven't really had too much time to experiment with levels. <br />- I've looked about how other games have handled this and thought holding it would be best way to do it. Having to press the button will require a bit more work to have it not rely on a single frame, but I'll try and implement it and see how it feels. Regardless, I can always use both methods.<br />- Easy enough, didn't really think about this as the title screen was just thrown to together so I could have something to test the menu with.<br />- Okay, I can do this but I'll wait till the title screen is closer to being finished. Depending how the title screen looks, I'll have to do this differently compared to what it is now.<br />- I have planned to do this from the start, that's why there are the &quot;????&quot; selections in the menu. The problem is finding the best way for the game to play for both modes. Double jumping would be fine for a survival mode but would allow to much freedom for a more challenge based mode. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">This game seems very modern, like it would make a good app game.</div><br />I could imagine with some changes, it would, but I have don't really have an interest in that.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Another idea: it would be nice if the flies did not damage or knock back the character. They could be like the equivalent of bonus points (or in this case extra time/life).</div><br />I had it this way for a little while but it felt as if they weren't part of the game, or were unfinished. I does feel weird being knocked back by them so I'll fiddle around with this again and see if there is something I can do.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">3rd option: you could have both approaches.
