		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />True, the ROM could be extended to UNROM (8 banks, 16 KiB each) to UOROM (16 banks, 16 KiB each) and an original music engine loaded into that extra memory. But the problem with squeezing DPCM samples into classic games is that most mappers used for classic games do not support bankswitching the part of address space where DPCM is loaded. So unless there's already a lot of unused space in the last bank (unlikely), it will take extensive hacking of the game engine to fit DPCM in.

<br />
<br />The DMC can only play samples from $C000 and up (though it can have samples wrap to $8000 -- however that's incredibly impractical).
<br />
<br />Unless the mapper you're using can do crafty RAM mappings (MMC5 is the only one that comes to mind which could do it), using RAM won't work.

<br />
<br />Only a small portion of the code is named and documented, but one potential place for DPCM sample data is $FC85 and about 300 bytes beyond. These are tables for how much damage each aquired weapon does to each enemy, and their address is defined by a pointer table located at address $BF44. (when the low code bank is switched in at $8000) So it would be easy to relocate these tables to another area. A lot of the data before and after these tables also seems to consist of (very repetitive) tables.
<br />
<br />If the Megaman game is to be DPCM:ed, I'd suggest replacing/rewriting the music and SFX code altogether to improve the music. That should also take away some of the slowdowns in the game, as the music code steals a surprisingly large portion of the CPU power.
