And even once you get good at it, it does no real good: nobody else is going to go through all that trouble to build their own.<br /><br />My idea would be something of a hybrid between a PC and an FPGA. Give you multiple processors (so you don't have to use multi-tasking to simulate parallelism) with a high enough clock to divide down to rough estimates of standard 90's era systems.<br /><br />Have a really, really light API to help control the hardware (video, audio, input -- connection interface details, eg memory card reader, HDMI, S/PDIF, controller ports -- are handled for you), with a focus on minimal latency. Drive the video and audio on per-pixel/sample clock rates ... get a certain memory address to hold the value you want, and make sure it's ready in time. Input polled from the controllers would also be done in real time. With a real-time OS, and known cycle overhead per operation, that shouldn't be too hard. Ideally, it'd be like blargg's S-DSP core: concrete "do this on this cycle" steps, and there'd be no need for things like semaphores or locks.<br /><br />Worst case, buffer it a tiny bit if needed. Just nothing like to up to ~75ms video, ~120ms audio we get on PCs now.<br /><br />Essentially like an open console, but with lower-level timing control. As if you're writing DSP firmware / microcode.<br /><br />You just give out the program, people load it into the system (that's the key part -- so that anyone can use it, not just EEs), and it can act just like anything it emulates.<br /><br />Better still if it's in a standardized language, so that the work won't be lost when a new generation of hardware comes out.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I contacted the guy thinking that he directly implemented the SNES hardware low-level style, but IIRC, he ported SNES9x to some CPU core running on the FPGA.<br /></div><br /><br />While the former is technically more impressive, I don't see much of a practical difference once you're emulating the hardware anyway. So long as the timing is the same, it'd be ideal to write in a language that's easier to understand.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />That might have been reasonable until the mid-2000s, when the Famicom/NES patents expired.<br /></div><br /><br />The only one I remember reading about was the (albeit very successful until he was sued) idiot selling NES-on-a-chip N64-knockoff controllers with ~30 copyrighted NES ROMs on-board. He got sued because of the games included.<br /><br />It would be interesting to try selling such a device with only a memory stick slot, so users can load games themselves.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Wed Oct 29, 2008 2:12 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, aside from the obvious "can never achieve perfect accuracy" problem -- all emulators suffer from ~16-48ms video output latency, ~30-120ms audio output latency, and ~16-48ms controller input latency. Not to mention the forced resampling of audio if you want to avoid video tearing, and the unnatural video interpolation to preserve the aspect ratio.<br /><br />While it's not really noticeable in isolation, you can definitely feel it side-by-side with the real system.<br /><br />Who knows, maybe in 10 years we'll have FPGA-like devices that can run C++-like code, and we can create cheap, easy-to-produce hardware devices with no latency issues.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Mon Oct 27, 2008 2:00 pm</p><hr />

It's nice to throw a Flash Cart or GDSF7 in the mix too for some perfection. I much prefer to play SNES games on my Super Famicom with a RGB monitor than to play on an emulator. Not to say that emulators aren't good, but you can't beat the original hardware.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Mon Oct 27, 2008 1:38 pm</p><hr />
