		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi!
<br />
<br />I have some questions about the save RAM.
<br />
<br />save RAM shares same address lines (A0 - A14) with PRG-ROM, so
<br />when writing to $6000 (save RAM) $8000 (PRG-ROM) is disabled by
<br />ANDing M2 with A15, save RAM is disabled with same fashion by
<br />ANDing A14 with A13.
<br />
<br />Where exactly save RAM /OE and /WE (from memory chip) are
<br />connected physically? Should i connect /WE to PRG R/W?
<br />I'm assume that /CE (chip enable) can be enabled by NANDing
<br />A13 with A14.
<br />
<br />Do i need a mapper for writing to save RAM? NES schematics suggests
<br />that i don't need a mapper for reading.
<br />
<br />What exactly is M2? in NES schematics it's marked as "O2",
<br />should i see it as a somekind of address line enabler?
<br />and for what purpose it's present at the cart connector?
<br />
<br />Thank you
<br />
<br />- Sepi

<br />
<br />The address decoding sounds about right.  But you need to include M2 in the chip enables.  You can use the PRG /CE pin, which is A15 NAND M2.  If PRG /CE, M2, A13, and A14 are all high, you can enable the WRAM.  My cart does this with a NAND gate and a 2-to-4 line decoder.
<br />
<br />For the WRAM /WR and /RD signal, I hooked PRG R/W directly up to /WR.  And inverted it for the /RD (with another NAND gate).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, it all pretty clear now, my NVRAM chip has /CE and /OE and /WR.
<br />It looks like i'll have to use a different chip because the one i have now
<br />requires /OE to be high and /CE low during the write cycle, RAM chips
<br />don't care about /OE.
<br />
<br />Actually that particular NVRAM chip is designed for EEPROM replacement,
<br />no wonder it cannot replace RAM chip.
<br />
<br />Thank you very much!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually, I mis-spoke earlier.  I meant to type that I hooked the inverted PRG R/W signal to the WRAM's /OE.  I was thinking of it as a /RD signal, since it is required to do a read.  Having /OE and /WR low at the same time would not be good (but maybe some chips would give priority to one or the other).
<br />
<br />The NVRAM you have sounds normal from what I can tell.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hmm, i checked some RAM datasheets if remember correctly,
<br />RAM chip don't care about /OE at all, they perform the write cycle
<br />if /CE and /WE are low, and completed when /CE or /WE goes high.
<br />
<br />NVRAM that i have requires that /OE must be held high before
<br />writing to it. In other words /OE is never considered as X (don't care)
<br />with NVrAM it's easier to generate a bus conflict.
<br />
<br />I can't guarantee that this information is accurate.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Still sounds to me like normal SRAM procedure, unless I'm confused.  If PRG R/W was inverted and fed to the RAM's /OE, then /OE will always be high whenever /WE is low.
<br />
<br />(off-topic warning)
<br />Good to see you again, BTW.  I haven't talked to you for a while.  It's kinda funny how I finally implementing that NES-to-PC comms stuff.  Using a PIC's UART on a cart, I ended up getting the convenience of parallel writes with the simplicity of serial hardware.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I checked it from the datasheet, you're right there wasn't anything
<br />strange about the NVRAM write cycle, keeping /OE inactive was more
<br />a recommendation, /WE automatically disables output drives when
<br />/WE is active. In a event that there is more than one device accesing
<br />the same RAM chip it's possible to generate a bus conflict but in NES this
<br />never happens with $6000 unless you're doing something crazy with it.
<br />
<br />&lt;off-topic&gt;
<br />Well, it nice to know that it finally works! You know, when we were
<br />developing that parallel port version, the information we needed
<br />wasn't covered in any NES document out there, and also i finally
<br />made that NES movie player/recorder by implementing that interrupt
<br />server it was about zillion times more accurate than the VB version.
