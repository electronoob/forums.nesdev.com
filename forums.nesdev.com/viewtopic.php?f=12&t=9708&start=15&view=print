		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well the problem is that I've tried that, and it doesnt work for some reason. I used a AMS1117 3.3 voltage regulator and the game will not boot, no matter what. I tested the voltage and it comes through at an even 3.30v, and the game wont boot. If I bypass that and hook up 5v to the chip, it will load, but obviously fry in a short time. With the voltage divider it boots, but stalls.<br /><br />If the game wont boot, but is getting the required 3.3v, what could the cause of the problem be? Am I missing something?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Looks like you've got 3 diodes for two different supplies.  The one on the left looks like it's suppling that glob top with ~4v.  But the two on the right are in series and suppling ~3.3v to everything else.  Make sure you're not neglecting that glob top's power supply.  I could be wrong, that's just what I see from the pic.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Right but thats not what I just mentioned. When using a 3.3v voltage regulator it wont load. Using a voltage divider it will load, and then stall. But when I used the diodes pictured the game worked fine, which is why I had wanted to know what kind of diodes they are.<br /><br />EDIT: Well, i just went out and bought some 1V forward diodes, and those work. I put 2 in series, and it dropped the voltage by 1.8, bringing me down to 3.4V (which works thanks to the 10% tolerance).<br /><br />So, I figure I will just use these as at least this works. I still have no clue why the voltage regulators I have dont work, and why the voltage divider stalls the game....but the diodes do the trick!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />They are almost certainly 3.6V zener diodes, reverse-biased (hooked up &quot;backwards&quot; between Vcc and Gnd, utilizing the clean breakdown properties of a zener diode to get the ~3V).<br /><br />Edit: The two on the right are in series, so maybe they are not zeners...  But a reverse-biased zener diode would work (get one rated for your target voltage, so a 3.6V zener diode reverse-biased across your voltage source and ground will result in a ~3.6V Vcc, which will be fine for a 3.3V chip).

They have a well-characterized voltage-current relationship in forward conduction, and are assumed to basically never allow any significant current in reverse.<br /><br />A zener diode, unlike a conventional diode, is designed so that 1- the reverse breakdown voltage is known and doesn't move, and 2- it can withstand continuous reverse current for an indefinite period of time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Either, but I'd rather talk about the 3.3V regulator you tried using instead. Which one did you get? How is it labelled? How did you hook it up? Did you add capacitors?<br /><br />And to be honest, you should be able to use the conventional already-purchased diodes in the same way as they're on the StarOcean pirate. (I've got a SATA power cable that uses that technique, even if it weirds me out)<br /><br />Chances are unfortunately high that you could have already destroyed the 3.3V part you had when you put the capacitor in series.

No i didnt try adding a capacitor, as the poster from Racketboy that I linked to did have any caps there for his cart. It was hooked up exactly as he had it done (please check out his thread for pics).

Try adding capacitors between Ground and Vin  or Ground and Vout, near to the regulator and/or the IC you're powering off it.
