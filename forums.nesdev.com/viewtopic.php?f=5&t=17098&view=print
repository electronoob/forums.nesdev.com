Click it and you'll find one of the checkboxes is &quot;Allow comments&quot;.  Uncheck that and click Done.<br /><br />Disabling comments for a single existing video: go to Creator Studio (sometimes called &quot;Video Editor&quot;, or &quot;Video Manager -&gt; Videos&quot; -- depends where in the UI you are).  Find the video you want and click the Edit button next to it.  Find the Advanced Settings tab and follow the same instructions as above.<br /><br />Disabling comments for multiple existing videos: go to Creator Studio (sometimes called &quot;Video Editor&quot;), which will give you a list of all your videos.  For each video you want to edit in bulk, check the checkbox to the left of the video row (there's an empty <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">[ ]</tt> to the left of each video).  At the top of the video listing table, click &quot;Actions&quot; (to expand it), then pick the menu item &quot;More actions...&quot;, then pick &quot;Comments&quot;, then choose &quot;Disable comments&quot;.  Because only ~30 videos are visible per page, you will have to do this process on each pages' set of videos, which can be tedious -- no sense in complaining as it's a one-time thing you gotta do.<br /><br />Or you could have just clicked &quot;Help and feedback&quot;, searched for the word &quot;comments&quot;, and found that the first result was <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7072797?hl=en" class="postlink">Turn comments on and off</a>.  From here you could have learned that you can set &quot;upload defaults&quot; like so: go to the Creator Studio, expand &quot;Channel&quot; on the left, select &quot;Upload defaults&quot;, uncheck &quot;Allow comments&quot;, and click &quot;Save&quot; in the upper right.<br /><br />Let me know where to send a bill for this &quot;how to spend a few minutes exploring a user interface and using the Help feature&quot; tutorial. :P

I hate trying to improvise a video in one take on a wobbly camera phone with no editing tricks.

Have some funny/sarcastic answers on your pocket.<br />I know it's very difficult! But you can at least try to deal with it.<br /><br />Or if you think it's better to don't care and prefer to not have any video online if you had to deal with the trolls, I think you've done the right thing already.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle">psycopathicteen wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What kind of camera do people on You Tube use and where can I find this type of cameras.</div><br />Most streamers (and YouTubers) use the Logitech C920 or the C922 Pro Stream webcams for just video (most use either headsets or better-quality mics for audio).  I have a C920 -- great camera, and Windows 7 includes slim/clean drivers (from Windows Update -&gt; Optional updates).<br /><br />As for the &quot;just learn to give no fucks&quot; sentiment on YT videos etc. -- it's valid advice, but I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend (on YT) disabling comments except for very select/choice videos, which is what I do.  Most comments are either idiotic, worthless (no substance/point), or insulting (this includes trolling).  It's just not worth it.
