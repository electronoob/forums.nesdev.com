1) You should open it if you have any desire to play it, it's not as rare as you may think, there are literally hundreds of sealed Dokis, maybe even a thousand or two out there and their value will not surpass $30 for a long time since they're one of the more common sealed disks. Quite a large amount of FDS games are able to be purchased new because a few collectors have horded retail boxes of sealed games for the last 10 years.<br /><br />2) I'll bet anything it's not erased, all the more reason for you to try it.<br /><br />3) FDS disks are extremely rugged; I have shoddy *pirate* disks dating back to 1987, some of which are really grimey, they've got dirt/cat hair/nicotine stains etc etc. With some finesse they are still possible to read. I've learned that if anything stops a disk from working its a mechanical failure at one time or another due to the plastic shell getting brittle or the inner cotton thing getting torn off or crap getting in the way of the head. These failures in turn can cause the drive to wear down the disk and eventually corrupt  data. Fortunately, Nintendo disks rarely have mechanical problems because their build quality is so high, every official disk of mine is capable of starting first try or two.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Thu May 25, 2006 6:36 am</p><hr />

I think that you should let it sit upopend in a static free bag and kept at 37F with a humidity of 4% inorder to keep disks like that from going bad fast and the nselling it a couple of years from now. Thats the only way I was able to preserve a disk like that. Oh yea and the place you keep the disk has an effect on the life expectancy. Although you might not realize it but T.V.I. (Television Interferance yes that same stuff that causes your TV picture to not be perfiect) can also ruin disks. Lighning, UV, magnets, THE BACK OF A COMPUTER?TV SCREEN, the faint electromagnetic pulses sent out by you body wile moveing. All these things can destroy magnetic disks. You'll notice that HDDs are quite protected against thses things but floppys arent. This is why they are so much more to suceptible to corrution. Besides if you have something like that chances are(unlsess someone who has no idea what the value of something like that might possibly be) no one will ever open it. Besideds by the time someone does open it how could they possibly track it back to you?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=464">jackpkmn</a> — Wed May 24, 2006 5:06 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">donknotts wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />P.S. I Will never open it.<br /></div><br />So it's not your problem. And even if it is perfect, these disks do not last forever. Time alone will ruin your disk, before you can sell it for thousands of $$$.<br /><br />Anyway, the person who buys it from you is the one to worry about that. And who knows, this thing might never be opened anyway, so what difference does it make?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed May 24, 2006 3:05 pm</p><hr />
