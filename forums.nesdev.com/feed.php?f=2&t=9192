Makefiles are useful when you have many files to deal with.<br /><br />Since the process I used only compiled a single .s file which included others, I found a simple batch file to be more than adequate.<br /><br />I've since been experimenting with C, and the steps have become a little more complicated, though I tend to compile and fix compiling errors frequently, and create new .c files seldom, so I still haven't yet felt the urge to work out a makefile system.<br /><br />Anyhow, makefiles are an alright solution, but they're hardly necessary in a lot of cases, and for someone trying to learn how to use cc65 they might get in the way of understanding how the compiler is invoked and used. If you're already well versed in make, it's probably not a problem at all, but for learning NES programming on cc65, I'm not sure they're very helpful.<br /><br />Example makefiles are great to have around, to show people who need it how to set one up. I'm just suggesting that they don't really need to be part of a beginner's guide to cc65.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Mon Aug 06, 2012 2:14 pm</p><hr />

I might however make my own, <strong>there's a lot of features on that that I won't use</strong>.<br /></div><br />I don't really understand this line of thinking. The makefile is 300 lines long, it's not gonna slow down your build cycle or bloat your project folder, so it doesn't really matter if some of the features go unused.<br /></div><br /><br />Of course the makefile isn't bloated, even if it was several thousand lines long I won't notice the difference when making the project (assuming there are not more dependencies in the 1000+ line makefile, otherwise it does take more time to rebuild the project of course). The thing is I prefer starting down and going up, starting with a near empty makefile, adding dependecies to the SOURCES var, letting the rules make object files, and then add recipes to make some &quot;fancy&quot; data generators (ex: bitmap to chr data, music data generator etc.). The makefile is small and I don't need to scroll through it. Usually, I even put my &quot;make vars&quot; in a separate file and I include it in the real makefile for that purpose, so I don't play with my makefile. Otherwise the makefile is perfectly fine, the only questionable thing is my attitude to prefer making my own makefiles <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> [WELL, I might just shut up, take that makefile and put the &quot;make vars&quot; in a separate file and I'll be happy].<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I think that a useful macro to use with that mapper is a one like NEWBANK, that pads the remaining space of the bank and set PC to $8000. That's not generalisable to other mappers though.<br /></div><br />It's not really possible to do padding like that with CA65 because of the object+linker approach. In other words, in any given module, you don't know where in segment (bank) the linker will place your code (unless you put all of it in a single module, which is not &quot;the right thing&quot; to do with CA65+LD65).<br /></div><br /><br />That's right, normally you can't use absolute addresses with a linker (though I have a exception in mind, the mplink linker) and even then that's negating the use of a linker, so we need something to tell the linker to put code (or data) at some boundaries, which rainwarrior just wrote. I just didn't think enough before replying that, my apologies.<br /><br />Thanks all for your help! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=336">Jarhmander</a> — Mon Aug 06, 2012 1:31 pm</p><hr />

Here's a few CC65 projects that I have released as open source:<br /><br />AOROM music cartridge source: <a href="http://rainwarrior.ca/music/moon8romsrc.zip" class="postlink">http://rainwarrior.ca/music/moon8romsrc.zip</a><br />NSF/NES swap test sources: <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/883356/swap_tests.zip" class="postlink">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/883356/swap_tests.zip</a><br />NSF rip source for Mr. Gimmick Europe: <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/883356/mr_gimmick_nsf_dev.zip" class="postlink">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/883356/mr_gimmick_nsf_dev.zip</a><br /><br />If you want proper documentation on the cfg files, try here: <a href="http://www.cc65.org/doc/ld65.html" class="postlink">http://www.cc65.org/doc/ld65.html</a><br /><br />The best way to align code/data to a specific address is to create a segment for it in the cfg. Any source file can place code into any segement or multiple segments (in my assembly projects so far, I have preferred one monolithic translation unit to having several object files, but you can split it up as you like). You can easily control padding bytes (fill/fillval), and where precisely to put things in the ROM or RAM.<br /><br />The basics of it is that the MEMORY regions that output to file will be output in the order specified. The SEGMENTS regions go into the the MEMORY regions, filling up each one in the order specified. Your source code then specifies a segment for any code to go into at someplace in the code. If you want a new bank, create a MEMORY block for it and as many SEGMENT sections as you need to divide it up. The MEMORY regions can also represent blocks of memory, not part of the output ROM.<br /><br />The AOROM source shows how I made 32k banks. The swap tests show how I made code that is stored in ROM that can get copied to RAM (SEGMENT has a load memory region, but also a run memory region; load is where it goes in the ROM, run affects the program counter). Note: the swap test for Sunsoft 5B does not properly set up banks; this is because I was lazy and also because it was unnecessary due to how the banks are already initialized by the PowerPak before swapping.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Mon Aug 06, 2012 12:41 pm</p><hr />

In other words, in any given module, you don't know where in segment (bank) the linker will place your code (unless you put all of it in a single module, which is not &quot;the right thing&quot; to do with CA65+LD65).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=80">thefox</a> — Mon Aug 06, 2012 11:07 am</p><hr />

Thanks for the makefile, it will probably come in handy, so your intervention was useful, and I see I'm a bit rusty with makefiles. I might however make my own, there's a lot of features on that that I won't use.<br /><br />Concerning your suggestion, I'm on a Linux machine, so no Notepad++, unfortunately.<br /><br />Thanks cpow for the link! Looking at the linker script (an INI file?) it seems trivial, though I don't know why all ROM0..14 refer to the same location and length (it's just multiple alias for the same location?), and what's the &quot;file=%O&quot; setting means. Guess I'll RTFM then <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.<br /><br />Oh, SNROM is one of the &quot;big&quot; MMC1 configuration available. So I figure ROM0..14 is the first 15 16KiB banks available at $8000-$BFFF and ROM15 is the fixed last bank at $C000-$FFFF. I think that a useful macro to use with that mapper is a one like NEWBANK, that pads the remaining space of the bank and set PC to $8000. That's not generalisable to other mappers though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=336">Jarhmander</a> — Mon Aug 06, 2012 10:46 am</p><hr />
