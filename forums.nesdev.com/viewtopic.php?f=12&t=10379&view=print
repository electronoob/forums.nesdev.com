I have bought / ordered all the stuff i need to do the 2 projects that i have detailed guides for, but I'm trying to line up donor carts to try on projects i don't have guides for.<br /><br />I found the attached spreadsheet which lists most, if not all games, along with Size, Rom type, sram size, version, hirom/lorom, and Rom speed, etc.<br /><br />What I am questioning is How compatible do these need to be?<br /><br />For Instance, I am looking at doing a Final Fantasy V, which is listed as such:<br /><br />FINAL FANTASY 5	SquareSoft	16 MBit	NTSC	ROM	and SRAM	64 KBit	1.0	Yes(HiRom)	SlowROM<br /><br />The Problem is finding another game with those exact qualities. Doing an F5 on the document only brings me to other Japanese games or Secret of Mana. Obviously i don't want to use SoM...<br /><br />And Searching the document for other games that are Hirom AND SlowRom doesn't produce any viable candidates (all the US games i saw didn't have ram chips).<br /><br />I assume that if need be i can swap a ram chip from a 2nd donor cart, but then what exactly, is the base reuirement just the HiRom or LoRom?<br /><br />It seems from reading that i can put a SlowRom game onto a board from a FastRom donor cart (though not vice versa), if that is true would a game that matches everything except the rom speed be suitable, like say a copy of NHL 97?<br /><br />Which brings me to my last question. When looking at PCB boards online, I see that the SFC FFV cart uses a different decoder (MB74LS139) than NHL 97 (MAD-1A). Does this make a difference? Or will it be necessary to pull the MB74 chip out of another game.<br /><br />Thanks for any help you are able to give me.<br /><br />-David

However, the only cart I know of that used SHVC-1J3B-XX was FFV, so that doesn't help you.  You could also use boards with 256K RAM without any issues, so that also allows SHVC-1J5M-XX<br /><br />A quick search of SNESCentral brings up the following options:<br />SHVC-1J3M-XX (1x32Mbit ROM/64K RAM)<br />===============================<br />Bounty Sword<br />Breath of Fire II<br />Chrono Trigger<br />Dai-4-ji Super Robot Taisen (Super Robot Wars 4)<br />Dragon Quest III - Soshite Densetsu e...<br />Dragon Quest VI - Maboroshi no Daichi<br />Earthbound<br />Fire Emblem - Seisen no Keifu<br />Fortune Quest - Dice o Korogase<br />Front Mission<br />Gakkou de Atta Kowai Hanashi<br />Human Grand Prix IV - F1 Dream Battle<br />Illusion of Time/Illusion of Gaia<br />Madden NFL '95<br />NHL '95<br />NHL '97<br />Romancing Saga 2　(ロマンシング　サ・ガ2)<br />Romancing Saga 3　(ロマンシング　サ・ガ3)<br />Secret of Evermore<br />Secret of Mana<br />Seiken Densetsu 3 (せいけんでんせつ３, 聖剣伝説３)<br /><br />SHVC-2J3M-XX (2x8Mbit ROM/64K RAM)<br />==============================<br />7th Saga<br />Secret of Mana<br />Super Adventure Island II / Takahashi Meijin no Daibouken Shima II<br /><br />SHVC-1J5M-XX (1x32Mbit ROM/256K RAM)<br />================================<br />Fushigi no Dungeon 2 - Fuurai no Shiren<br />Sim City 2000<br />Winning Post 2 - Program \'96 (ウイニングポスト2プログラム\'96)<br /><br /><br /><br />tl;dr: Madden NFL '95, NHL '95, NHL '97 (it's a good bet that any NFL/NHL after '95 will probably work too, the SNESCentral list is far from complete)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you want a more generalized answer, here you go.  The important factor is the PCB ID, ignore those compatibility spreadsheets/lists.  First things first, if your game needs a special chip (SA-1, SuperFX, DSP-n, etc), you'll need a donor with that same chip.  Most likely, you're talking a ROM hack/translation if you need a special chip, so just use the board for the original game.<br /><br />For non-special chip games, here's a quick breakdown of the PCB ID (I'll only cover the common cases here):<br /><br />SHVC-ABCD-XY<br /><br />SHVC: ID prefix, doesn't really matter here.  SHVC is the most common, but there are others.<br />A: number of ROM chips.  Probably 1 or 2.  If 2, they are probably 2x8Mbit, limiting you to 16Mbit games.<br />B: A = LoROM, J = HiROM<br />C: SRAM size.  1 = 16K, 3 = 64K, 5 = 256K<br />D: Decoder. M = MAD-1, B = '139.  MAD-1 supports up to 32Mbit, '139 supports up to 16Mbit*<br />XY: Doesn't matter.<br /><br />*There are 2 different ROM chip sizes, 32-pin chips only support up to 8Mbit, 36-pin chips support up to 32Mbit.  A MAD-1 board with a 32-pin ROM will only support up to 8Mbit.  Check the PCB photo at <a href="http://www.snescentral.com/system.php" class="postlink">SNESCentral</a> and count the ROM pins.  Their info is often incomplete, so if they say unknown supported ROM/RAM size, use the info posted here.  Also, this assumes you don't want to mess around with adding/modifying the address decoder (e.g. add a '139 to a MAD-1 board to support 2x32Mbit TSOP ROMs, etc.).<br /><br />Once you know which PCBs will support the ROM you're using, you can use SNESCentral to find games that use that PCB.  Sometimes, a game uses more than one PCB during different production runs, so you're not 100% guaranteed to get the PCB you want, but you can check the PCB that you get against your requirements, and chances are it may still work.<br /><br /><br />Examples:<br /><a href="http://www.snescentral.com/pcbboards.php?chip=SHVC-1A3M-30" class="postlink">SHVC-1A3M-30</a>: LoROM, MAD-1 (32Mbit ROM), 64K RAM<br /><a href="http://www.snescentral.com/pcbboards.php?chip=SHVC-1A3B-11" class="postlink">SHVC-1A3B-11</a>: LoROM, '139 (16Mbit ROM), 64K RAM<br /><a href="http://www.snescentral.com/pcbboards.php?chip=SHVC-2J3M-20" class="postlink">SHVC-2J3M-20</a>: HiROM, MAD-1 (2x8Mbit ROMs), 64K RAM

I wait anxiously...  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><br /><br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />Since I'm at work waiting to go home I'll share my discoveries I made at home. I had a copy of NHL 97 that i had removed the maskrom and replaced it with an IC socket. I then, using my new desoldering pump (OMG if only i had one of these a year ago!!) to remove the maskroms from Madden 96, NHL 95, and some BB game, NBA 97 or something.<br />The Madden 96 maskrom were the only ones to work in the NHL socket. I got so excited when it booted up, I can't wait for my chips to get here so i can program them!<br /><br />Knowing now what you guys told me, The NBA Live 97 is LoRom which is why it didn't work.<br /><br />The NHL 95 game is only 32 pins. Is there something special that has to be done when putting a 32 pin MaskRom in a board? (I know this wont matter when i use my tsops as they will all be using the 36 pin adapter, but I'm trying to understand how this all works.)<br /><br />Because I'm that type of person i have a strong urge to go home and switch out my SoE, and SoM and BoFII maskroms and start swapping boards just to see them work!! (That's crazy talk though  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> )

Also, unfortunately without an economy of scale, donors are still cheaper than new PCB's + shells.<br /><br />Also, to answer your question about 32-pin ROMs on 36-pin boards, they have the exact same pinout, the 36-pin ROM just has 4 extra pins on one end, so a 32-pin chip will fit just fine without any special considerations, so long as you put it in the correct holes.  The 36-pin PCB's are pretty clearly marked to indicate this.<br /><br />As for SoE/SoM/BoFII, do us all a favor and just take my word for it that they work, k?

That certainly should be appealing to alot of people. The newer NES pcbs will be the same way. Once new cases are sorted out, we can finally move toward people not destroying original games.
