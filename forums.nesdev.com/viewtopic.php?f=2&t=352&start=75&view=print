		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm a little confused on how to do 16 bit stuff, since you can only have 8 bits in the accumulator. I know you can do stuff with the carry flag, but I don't know how. Okay, I'm confused about how to like load 16 bits. I was looking at your code you supplied eariler bregalad, and I don't understand how you just randomly had the variable "pointer" and "temp2" just randomly get values. Like you didn't store anything in temp2 when you ROLd it, and you loaded pointer without even storing anything in it, did you mean pointerH? I'm sorry, I'm really confused, and i'm angry about this and my EPROMs that are all stupid. Please explain.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />yeah Nesasm uses yukky brakets for indirection instead of parenthesis... one of my annoyances with it.
<br />
<br />anyway... if ADC addition causes a wrap (FF-&gt;00), the C flag will be set... you can check the status of the C flag after addition and increment the high byte if it's set.
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;lda turd<br />&nbsp;adc varb<br />&nbsp;sta turd<br /><br />&nbsp;bcc skip_inc&nbsp; ;if carry is clear, skip over... otherwise....<br />&nbsp;inc turd1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; increment high byte of address<br /><br />skip_inc:<br />&nbsp;ldy #$00<br />&nbsp;lda &#91;turd&#93;,y<br />&nbsp;;etc<br /></div><br /><br />alternatively you can use ADC to add the carry to turd1:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;lda turd<br />&nbsp;adc varb<br />&nbsp;sta turd<br /><br />&nbsp;lda turd1<br />&nbsp;adc #$00&nbsp; &nbsp;;add the carry flag<br />&nbsp;sta turd1<br /><br />&nbsp;ldy #$00<br />&nbsp;lda &#91;turd&#93;,y<br />&nbsp;;etc<br /></div>
<br />
<br />using adc avoids the use of the label, but takes 2 more bytes and is a bit slower.
<br />
<br />Another annoyance with nesasm:  no nameless labels

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some will say I'm highhacking a thread, but about NESASM anoyances, I think the two dish mentionned are effectively annoning, but the one that definitely make NESASM suck is how banks are organized. Everything (including PRG and CHR) is organized in 8kb banks, and that's EXTREMLY anoying.
<br />You'll probably have to be familiar with those maths stuff and carry if you code things at a decent speed. I think that most tutorials does only mention things techinically (aka : ADC add operand with acumulator. Flags affected : C, N, Z), and does not explain things much how they'll work in practice (like 16-bit addition code). So people new at programming like Celius can miss some really basic stuff while learing some advanced ones, just because tutorials aren't focused on the right things.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Speaking of that...
<br />
<br />I just noticed Celius isn't putting a CLC before his ADC (and it's after a crapload of ASLs, so it's possible C might be set).
<br />
<br />@ Celius:  If the C flag is set when you do ADC, an extra 1 gets added to your sum.  Example:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">SEC<br />LDA #$02<br />ADC #$02<br />; A is now 5, not 4<br /></div>
<br />
<br />If C is potentially set by a previous instruction (like say, ASL), and you don't want that extra 1 added, you can avoid it by putting a CLC command before the ADC

Like I have a maze, which is in my opinion, the perfect testing for collision. I have squares layed out like a maze.

<br />Note that this code can easily be optimized (stuff like lsr followed by asl can rather be made with and) but it won't change the functionality or you programm, only speed and size.
<br />Also, you're using a variable (here Colflag) to return the exit parameters (in that case if collision is active or not).
<br />For a such subroutine, you can use the carry flag as one bit of parameter, so you can made your routine in the way that the carry is clear if there is no collision, or set if you have a collision (or the other way arround). Then the routine calling this subroutine will simply check for the carry flag to know if there is a collision. The end of your code will look like this :
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda &#91;turd&#93;,Y<br />asl A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;The bit 7 of accumulator transfers into C<br />rts&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;If bit 7 was set, there is a collision, and that state is returned trough carry<br /></div>
<br />You simply avoid using an useless variable, and you code is much shorter. Also, in the example you posed, you seem to write #$01 in your collflag if thereis a collision but what about if there is none ? You may forgot to paste the piece of code writing #$00 into colfag there, but who knows ?

But, I was going to ask you a question, and I really don't want to ask it, but I have to, and I appologize for making it hard for anybody, and I will try and do these things myself. Okay, so, how are you supposed to check if the carry flag has 1 in it? Oh, like BCS? Okay, I think I get it. I am seeing that in my code, I have it so I am doing an ADC right before I say BCC, and that could be causeing problems, and C would always be set right? but then I look in the Debugger, and it's NEVER set. I don't know why, and it's making me mad. If I do AND instead of ASL, how will the carry flag ever be set? will it be? I'm thinking not, and I'm wondering what I should do. Okay, well, i am going to study my code now.
