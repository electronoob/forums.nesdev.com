If I sold that many in a certain period of time I'd call the entire project a ridiculous success.  Of course ... it's an UNROM+CHRRAM game (at the very least) so ... probably not quite $2 a board... you also need memory chips... the enclosures ... and boxes.... and manuals.  Wonder if this is a realistic breakdown?<br /><br />Per product:<br /><ul><li> custom PCB $5 or ReproPak $4 ($3 in bulk?)</li><li> Cartridge $4 in bulk ?? or cannibalize a few lots of crappy sports games from ebay... maybe $1 apiece if lucky</li><li> Label $2</li><li> Box $5</li><li> Manual $5</li><li> 1mbit eeprom $4</li><li> 8kb sram (chr) $3</li><li> 8kb sram (prg, maybe) $3 </li><li> plus shipping $?? i guess a lot</li></ul><br />that's just cost of materials ... consider the labor (which is massive; ordering parts, assembly, testing, packaging, marketing, setting up shop, filling orders)  and cost of any services like Paypal<br /><br />And this is not even counting the work put into development of the PCB if it had to be custom<br /><br />All the sudden the Kira Kira Star Night project warrants some new-found respect from me.<br /><br />Edit: the INL thing sounds like it will relieve a lot of the cost and headache.  but as you can see, not all!

And as to whether or not there will be demand ... I'm not worried about that either. In today's return-to-roots-obsessed climate, it's a certainty.  <em>Eventually</em> every copy of the 100 (assuming they were successfully produced) would be sold, and it wouldn't affect my ability to pay rent because I'm a freelancer.  One risk though - if manufacture or filling orders are botched and all the investment goes down the drain due to non-working or destroyed products.  That's a legitimate risk in a production this small-potatoes.  Really the biggest concrete risk is failure to deliver and losing face.<br /><br />Sorry for derailing the thread though... it just helps me to use concrete examples (in this case, my project) to think about abstract concepts

That's how Doom worked, and that's how OUYA games work.

Many of these people are actual professionals who do this for a living, not beard-furrowing dudes living in basements (which is usually what the term &quot;homebrew&quot; brings to mind in Western culture).  This was a deep collaboration of many people to create something great, so as I see it, a US$30 price tag is pocket change for something like this.<br /><br />I refuse to discuss the nature of the Famicom cartridge costs because discussing that takes away from the entire point I'm trying to make (here and in earlier posts).  My message is that I fully support things like this and have absolutely <strong>nothing</strong> negative to say about such.  I'm taking it at all at face value, because when it comes to projects like this, I feel that's the right thing to do, not get caught up in the financial semantics or some technical babblebutt; I've <a href="http://boards.pocketheaven.com/viewtopic.php?p=21550#21550" class="postlink">mentioned in the past (see last bullet item)</a> that certain things in the NES/FC world are best just left accepted and enjoyed and not &quot;psychologised&quot; over ad nauseum.<br /><br />Can I go home now?  :-)

Then again, maybe Nintendo wouldn't allow anyone to make anything, just like they did 30 years ago.  Only difference now is that Nintendo isn't as financially viable as they were when they were a monopoly.

For Riki, the booklet is also an important part of the release as he's also a well-known doujin (and even professional) picture artist.
