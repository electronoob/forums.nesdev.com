		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think I've read that there was a special limited version of the game cart (given to people who won a lottery and the like, as with many Famicom games of the time) but I am not so sure about it and I don't know whether there are any differences from the original (the limited edition of Zeta Gundam is different from the released one for sure).
<br />
<br />However, I doubt this is the case. This may just be a pirate cart (as this show was VERY popular I've seen loads of pirate carts of it back in the time), since limited edition packages are more likely to look fancy such as having gold, silver or transparent in colour. You may also check the case, as the game was manufactured by (possibly also developed by) Namco(t) since Bandai didn't have enough resource to make their own games yet. If it's just a generic (Nintendo style) FC case it's very likely to be one of those common pirates.

<br />
<br />You are speaking of Hong Kong correct? I definetly would collect pirate carts if they were easibly accessible. Sometimes they are cheap and janky and not fun but somtimed they are amazing and both are cool in their own way. Sometimes when they are really bad I find myself playing those more to see what happens next. haha

<br />Yes. No wonder many pirate hacks and original unlicensed games (especially those sold in physical form) released these days are nicked HKO, even though the majority of them aren't even developed here. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />

<br />
<br />Hahah, that is something else. If I ever made it to Hong Kong I would have to send things home through mail and carry some carts back if that would be possible because damn I would have a field day on that.

<br />I always understood an HKO as any Famicom or NES game with an original program but unlicensed parts-other-than-program sold on a cartridge. By those criteria, Tet&#1103;is by Tengen is an HKO. Not all HKOs come from HK, just as not all "Cheddar" cheese comes from South West England.
