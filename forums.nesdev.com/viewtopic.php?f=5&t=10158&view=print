		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The game &quot;Over Horizon&quot; never came out in the United States. There is only a Japanese and a PAL version.<br />But the thing that confuses me: Whenever I see the package or the catridge or the manual, it's always the German version. (The Seal of Quality is written &quot;Qualit√§tssiegel&quot;.) I've never seen an English version. Even bootgod.dyndns.org knows only the German cartridge. (Besides, why don't they have the Japanese game listed?)<br />So, is something like that possible? That a game really only came out in Germany, but not in the other European countries? Why is this the case? Since they bothered to make a PAL conversion of the Famicom game, why release it only in Germany instead of various European countires? And why Germany in the first place?

Each distributor got its own version of the lockout chip. This is why PAL B games sold in Germany don't work in PAL A consoles sold in Britain.

Why not in other European countries?<br />Alternate question: Did the PAL version of &quot;Over Horizon&quot; ever appear in a country other than Germany? If yes, does an English manual exist?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Looks like Takara decided to publish the game in Germany/Wherever.   Generally, it's not Nintendo's decision alone to publish 3rd-party games.  The European market was 2-3 years behind the US one for Nintendo systems, so publishers there made decisions to bring over games independently of their US arms.  Sunsoft and Konami released several Famicom-derived games that never hit the US.<br /><br />Anyway, this topic is totally unrelated to developing programs on the NES.  Could you put further questions about game/hardware region variants in the &quot;General Stuff&quot; category?

But everything else has to go into the general stuff sub forum where you can talk about anything from the latest movies to cacadoos. Why isn't there a &quot;General NES stuff&quot; sub forum for everything that has nothing to do with developing, but that's still NES-related? Why is there such a gap? Why does the forum go from &quot;technical NES stuff&quot; right to &quot;every topic in the world&quot; instead of having &quot;every other NES topic&quot; in between?

This is not the case any longer since ~1995

There is a sub forum for NES development in Middle Eastern languages (WTF???), but not one for general NES discussion. And that's a serious lack.<br />In the programming forum where I sometimes go, there are sub forums for the various programming languages, then one for general PC stuff and <em>then</em> one for off-topic stuff. The technical PC stuff doesn't get mixed with chat about the latest celebrity gossip.<br />This should be the same here:<br /><br />First level forums: NES development stuff<br />Second level forums: NES general stuff<br />Third level forums: General stuff<br /><br />When I go to any kind of NES forum, I don't want to discuss my general-purpose-but-still-NES-related questions in the general off-topic forum because I cannot be sure that the experts here even go to that forum.
