		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I haven't really done anything with music yet, apart from the first two or three Nerdy Nights music tutorials. So I wanted to ask:<br /><br />Assuming that I have a soundtrack, i.e. it is known what notes are put into what APU channel for what amount of time: How complex is the actual code for this?<br /><br />I was under the impression that you simply read the values from a constant array and then put them into the port addresses. A simple loop that reads the APU value and the number of frames this sound is supposed to be on. And then you set the value to the APU port, start the counter and when the counter is 0, you set the next music value. And this you do with all three channels.<br /><br />Pseudo code:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">OncePerFrame:<br /><br />if StopMusic<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; WriteToApu(SquareWavePort1, 0)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; WriteToApu(SquareWavePort2, 0)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Timer = 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ArrayIndex = 0<br />else if Timer = 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; MusicData1 = ReadNextArrayValue<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; MusicData2 = ReadNextArrayValue<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Timer = ReadNextArrayValue<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; if ArrayIndex = ArraySize<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ArrayIndex = 0<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; WriteToApu(SquareWavePort1, MusicData1)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; WriteToApu(SquareWavePort1, MusicData2)<br />else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Timer = Timer - 1</div><br /> <br />But I've read several times that people write their own sound drivers etc. So, is this really that complicated? Do I have to implement an elaborated music function if I want to do music with a game?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think you have the general idea...<br /><br />You have an array of note frequencies.<br /><br />You have an a way to do note lengths... I do it by counting frames, decreasing the length each frame until it's zero, fetch the next note. Or silent the note by inserting a zero in either the volume register or in the frequency registers (or both...redundant)<br /><br />But, if you leave it there, the music will sound robotic and dull. Like Atari 2600 or arcades from the 70s. Adding volume envelopes and pitch bends (vibrato) and ways to mimic drums will make a big difference in sound quality.<br /><br />You're going to want a way to have multiple songs, also.<br /><br />I think at minimum you'll want to be able to set the volume of each note.

Two bits for the volume, 11 bits for the notes, two bits for the wave length or whatever. And one for timing that isn't really used in the tutorial.<br /><br />So, the volume and every change in pitch etc., isn't this just encoded in the actual music data (the array) and gets sent to the APU 1:1? And the code logic is doing exactly nothing at all except for copying bytes?<br /><br />So, I really don't understand why people talk about sound engines and all that stuff. Do the sound functions in games include music-related logic themselves?<br /><br />Because, as I said, I would have simply encoded everything, from the note to the volume to the pitch, into a APU-compatible data array and the PlaySound function would just iterate through the array and put everything into the APU as-is (plus every third value would be a timer value that goes into a counting variable.)<br />The function wouldn't know anything about drums and pitch. The drums would be part of the music as encoded in the array.<br /><br />Or am I misunderstanding something here?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">dougeff wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">You're going to want a way to have multiple songs, also.</div><br />Do you mean multiple songs at once or separately? Because if you mean separately, then sure: I would just call my function with another array.<br /><br />Also: The above pseudo code would of course be called four times per frame, each time for a different channel, so that each channel has its own data array.

They're values that are <em>combined</em> into values for the APU ports. For example, the volume from the musical phrase, which determines how loud or quiet a particular note is, has to be combined with the volume from the instrument's envelope, which determines how loud or quiet a particular part of a note is. And the pitch from the musical phrase is usually stored as a number of semitones above low A or low C or something, which has to be looked up through a lookup table and combined with the pitch modification from the instrument's envelope.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So, the volume and every change in pitch etc., isn't this just encoded in the actual music data (the array) and gets sent to the APU 1:1?

But that's not how music in NES games works. If they worked that way, music players would be a lot bigger, reducing the amount of space used in the ROM for other things such as graphics or level maps or alternatively increasing the cost of replicating the cartridge. A &quot;music engine&quot; is the audio equivalent of using metatiles for your graphics rather than storing a level as a big .bmp file.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So, I really don't understand why people talk about sound engines and all that stuff.

If you just want to get it working, you might as well use Famitone2, since it's ready-made and relatively easy to use.<br /><br />If you're getting someone else to make the music, make sure they know the capabilities of the music driver before they start. Don't just give them carte blanche to do whatever they want in Famitracker.

They eat up a LOT of space for what you get, compared to spending that space on code, etc.<br /><br />When they're in a fixed bank, there's a hard limit of 16k, but since fixed bank space is at a premium it's usually less than 8k dedicated to samples.<br /><br />Some mappers have a bank at C000-DFFF (e.g. MMC3 or FME-7) which makes it really flexible; you have 8k of dedicated space times as many banks as you want to allocate for samples. The most I've ever seen is 4 8k sample banks, used in Gimmick. (32k)
