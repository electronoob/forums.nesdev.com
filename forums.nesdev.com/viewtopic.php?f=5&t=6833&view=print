<br />
<br />How the fuck does Sony, the manufacturer of the freaking console, sell it for R$1999 (US$1130) while small (possibly illegal?) stores sell the exact same thing for R$890 (US$500)? That makes no sense...
<br />
<br />As if twice the original price charged by no-name importers wasn't bad enough, then comes Sony and doubles the price up one more time! You'd imagine that the manufacturers would be able to officially bring their product at a more reasonable price, but no. What's the explanation? Does Sony pay (much!) more tax than regular importers? If anyone here has a clue, please enlighten me.
<br />
<br />Not that I'm interested in buying a PS3 or anything, I just found this news outrageous.

<br />
<br />I know for a fact that another consumer electronics company opened up a Brazil office a few years ago and moved some software projects there for that specific purpose - even with the disturbances that would cause to the development. Then the global financial crisis hit and no one in Brazil could afford to buy shit from them anyway. Oh the irony.

<br />But then they have to pay a brazillion dollars in import duties in every other country to get the 51% Brazilian products <em>out</em> of Brazil.

<br />They only moved the development of a few small parts of the product's software to Brazil. I don't know where the hardware was physically assembled, but I'm guessing China.

<br />
<br />On a more serious note, similar prices (though not as inflated, but close!) are seen in post-socialist countries in the EU, like Sweden.  This is especially the case for technological/electronic devices.  There, it's actually cheaper to buy something in the US + pay international shipping rates + pay VAT than to buy it local.
<br />
<br />Though, in their case, I believe the markup is a result of vendors charging absurd amounts of money "just because they can".  I don't know what's going on in Brazil, but it could be something like that.
<br />
<br />If you ever want something from the US, let me know -- I ship stuff out internationally fairly often.

<br />I haven't done any ass research abroad, but I guess Brazil does have that fame. I don't think it compensates for expensive import taxes though.
