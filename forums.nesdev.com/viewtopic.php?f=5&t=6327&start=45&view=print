The BRR sample encoding scheme also employs a low-pass filter, so you might adjust that as well. This of course can't make up for the samples themselves lacking higher frequency content. Put another way, even a radically-enhanced SPC-700 couldn't deliver much cripser sound, while a radically-enhanced YM2612 could, because the FM parameters are essentially analog.

<br />Maybe Cubic or Sine interpolation is better than Gaussian though if that is what you mean. It outputs better treble. But if you want higer frequencies to sound good the only way is to use a higher sample rate = more memory.

<br />
<br />Speaking of amps, rather than putting a lot of effort into removing filters, why don't you just turn up the treble / high freq eq on your amp?  It won't go high enough?  Then just add an external graphic equaliser separate and bump up the high freqs on that.
<br />
<br />My point about the Amiga is that unlike most other machines, the filter on the Amiga is completely optional and can be disabled and enabled in software.  By forcing the filters off the quality of certain types of sounds are degraded (more on this below) along with, more importantly, the composer's original vision.
<br />
<br />Turning filters off degrades sound quality you here me say?  Lets take StarWing for example, a decent mix of both electronic band style music and classical orchestral music.  In my spc player I tuned the interpolation off and set the output freq to 32Kz (snes native).  Now when I hit play what I hear is sharper by a long shot but theres one large problem, EVERYTHING is sharper.  Things like bass drums and guitars and other low freq sounds get that nasty aliasing which just make them sound bad and practically kills the bass.  Putting the setting back to what I usually have them at and then pushing the treble on my amp and soundcard to the max sharpened the playback to practically the same levels with one major difference, the low freq sounds were nowhere nearly as poisoned by high freq artefacts.
<br />
<br />But I'm going on alot about sampled stuff here.  I dare say that removing filters on stuff with (nealy) pure synth audio is a good thing because most of the time those filters are to compensate for usually cheap circuit design.

Someone on a forum wondered why the sound was so much better than <a href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/gsm/" class="postlink">my GSM player</a>. They used the same codec, the same bitrate, and the same sample rate. It turned out that the GSM player was doing linear interpolation, while the demo was using nearest-neighbor (no) interpolation. So to explain the difference, I made this file:<br /><a href="http://pics.pineight.com/gbaforum/LOM_lerping.ogg" class="postlink">An interpolation from "The legend of MAX"</a><br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Original sample </li><li>#1 low-passed at 9 kHz, corresponding to the 18157 Hz sample rate used by GSM Player and Luminesweeper </li><li>#2 with every other sample repeated, corresponding to "No Interpolation" in Modplug Tracker </li><li>#3 convolved with [.5 .5] filter, corresponding to "Linear" in Modplug Tracker </li></ol>I guess "no interpolation" creates fake treble that some people accustomed to chiptunes might find pleasing, much like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_band_replication" class="postlink">spectral band replication</a> in mp3PRO and some AAC variants.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Hojo_Norem wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">but theres one large problem, EVERYTHING is sharper. </div>

<br />Perhaps.... I just did some tests and listened carefully songs with different interpolations. Now that it was pointed to, it is really obvious Cubic sounds the best. Gaussian interpolation make it sounds like a lowpass filter where that "muffled" sounds comes while the cubic interpolaiton would have been perfect. This is especially noticeable in the battle music of Chrono Trigger, the drums sounds really more clear with cubic interpolation while they sound muffled with Gaussian interpolation (the drums are recorded at a rate HIGHER than 32 kHz so the sample rate isn't going to make anything sound muffled here).
<br />
<br />Linar interpolation sounds quite good too, but sounds terrible for high rates are arcitfacts are created, this is especially noticeable in "Slam Shuffle" or "Techno de Chocobo" in FF6.
<br />No interpolation create lots of artifacts like tepples says "fake treble" or just random noise. There is also the artifact problem very noticeable in FF6. I don't see how this could be considered to sound better.

<br />
<br />Filters are there to get rid of the staircase waveforms that were mentioned earlier, so as to get more natural sound... recreation filters are what they're called. As everyone have noticed, I'm not fond of them <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
