I was wondering if you have any designs for such a system. The new one I'm working on is like a queue that takes up the entire $0300 RAM page. In it, you load the PPU address hibyte and lobyte, amount of tiles, and then the actual tile data. At VBlank, the address is copied, the tiles are read and copied, until there are no more chunks like these to copy. I was wondering if there is a better method than this.</div>
<br />
<br />This is actually a pretty standard method, but you may end up writing more code to work with this system than you would to just work with separate handlers for each purpose. I'm assuming though when you say there's the high byte, low byte, then tile data, you're talking about drawing a horizontal row of tile data, correct?
<br />
<br />If this is the case, you'll end up using a lot of buffers to draw an image with more than one row. Depending on the size of images, what may help is to have a system where you have the PPU low, high, width, and height of the image, and THEN the tile data. If coded efficiently, it could save time and space while still being general purpose.
<br />
<br />But honestly, I would recommend just coding separate handlers. For scrolling, have one that updates single rows/columns of tiles (this way you won't need bytes saying how long the row is because you would probably be updating all 32 or 30 tiles that come on screen as a new row or column is revealed). If you need to update a few miscellaneous tiles, just have another handler that does those.
<br />
<br />Going a little off topic, if you find yourself trying to do a lot of BG updates for things like moving trees, stars that flicker, moving water, etc., you may want to consider using CHR-RAM instead of CHR-ROM to update the tile images themselves rather than the entire background with new pre-defined tiles.

<br />
<br />Nah. For my project right now I'm just changing small tiles all over the screen. I was trying to come up with an excuse for using that CHR-RAM technique though.
