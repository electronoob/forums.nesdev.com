<br />I know people who could never let go of Winamp and still use it today. My brother, for example. I don't use VLC though... I think it's a great program, but its interface sucks, and it was too unstable the last time I tried.

<br />Unlike IRL human relations, relation on this (and others) forums are 100% intellectual, so there it doesn't really matter what gender other members of the forum are.
<br />
<br />But there is definitely girls in the Computer Science faculty on the campus I'm on. I've even had a female CS teacher, so yeah this is very possible.
<br />
<br />And I use Winamp all the time. (like right now haha). I listen way more frequently video games music than anything else. No wonder why I use so much less disk drive space than "most people".

<br />Yeah, I had a few female teachers too, but never for subjects like Java or web development. Math, Artificial Intelligence and Interfaces are the ones I remember right now...

<br />If anyone in my school is close to being a computer programmer, I'd be shocked. I'm in Highschool, hopefully get some community college in with programming and get a small degree or something, but then move onto better things. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />True, a PC built from parts of PCs that were old enough to have been left for dead might be fast enough to run Facebook but not Left 4 Dead <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> I guess that's one reason why I stick with NES development: its tools have much lower system requirements than XNA Game Studio.

<br />
<br />Me.  You won't catch me using VLC for anything, unless whatever video file I come across won't play in MPC-HC.  But for audio, I use Winamp (with all video support disabled).

I use Media Player Classic if I have to (for selecting alternate audio tracks, subtitles, etc.).  Heh, Windows Media Player doesn't even work on my machine now.. I mean it loads and runs and plays, but it won't output any sound at all.  I don't really care (I only ever open it by accident), but WTF is that?  It's like some hidden "user is deaf" option is checked.
