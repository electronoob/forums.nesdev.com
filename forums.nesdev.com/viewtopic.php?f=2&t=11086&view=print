		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello new friends,<br /><br />I'm modifying Mega Man 2 and I have a few things I need help on. It's mainly the hardware that's giving me the uncertainty. I see that Mega Man 2 is an SGROM-02 cart, and I was planning to use Rad Racer as a donor. Rad Racer is also an SGROM-02 cart, however has only a 28-pin PRG-ROM, as opposed to Mega Man 2's 32-pin PRG-ROM. The <em>board</em> has holes for 32 pins, so I can use a 32-pin DIP; but do I need to? I have a pair of Atmel AT28C256 flash chips- is there a way to make these work? Or must I find a 32-pin? If I can't use mine, and I wanted to avoid UV EPROMs and stick with flash chips, would you recommend a part number?<br /><br />I've read that the SGROM wiring should be identical to the SNROM on multiple sites, so I'm going to go with this being truth unless told otherwise. That means I'll be following the SNROM mod steps (bend pins 1,2,24,30,31... etc) correct?<br /><br />I guess the first question I need to get out of the way would be what anyone recommends for a 32 pin flash chip if I cannot use my existing AT28C256s...<br /><br />Sources:<br /><a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=47" class="postlink">NesCartDB - Mega Man 2</a><br /><a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=243" class="postlink">NesCartDB - Rad Racer</a><br /><a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc0006.pdf" class="postlink">Atmel AT28C256</a>, page 2<br /><br />X-posted in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nesdev" class="postlink">/r/NesDev</a><br />Thanks SpaceCowboy58

This means that the AT28C256 can only hold 32 kilobytes, 1/8 of what Mega Man 2 needs. Also, 64KB is the largest a 28-pin programmable chip can be. Non-programmable ones, like the ones found in original Nintendo carts, can go up to 128KB with 28 pins.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I wanted to avoid UV EPROMs and stick with flash chips, would you recommend a part number?</div><br />AT29C FlashROMs have worked great for me. You'd need an AT29C020 (<s>128KB</s> 256KB) or an AT29C040 (512KB) if you decide to go with those.

The RAM chip doesn't contain any data, it's filled during run time by the program. Some times you'll need to replace a CHR-RAM chip with a CHR-ROM one (easy) or a CHR-ROM chip with a CHR-RAM one (not easy if the CHR write pin is missing from the cartridge connector - it often is). This is not the case now though, since both the donor and the new game use CHR-RAM.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">edit: the AT29C020 would be a 2Mbit or 256KB chip, correct?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So the first thing I did was take Rad Racer apart. I noticed some differences...<br /><br />- The security screws were not the standard Nintendo 3.8mm variety; they were almost flatheads.<br />- The label is the North American style label with no &quot;NES-RC-CAN&quot; text. It seems to look USA-released.<br />- The two-digit code on the back is &quot;12&quot; which aligns with the USA distribution... However!<br />- The CHR-RAM is by NEC;  64S20 (and 8730MX) are written on the chip. This does not correspond to any of the Rad Racer carts listed on NesCartDB. The Europe PAL-B has an NEC CHR-RAM but that's the only similarity.<br />- The PRG-ROM is <em>possibly</em> NEC;  NES-RC-0 PRG W77 (and 8734KX) are written. The W77 stands out as the <em>Canadian version</em> of this cartridge. <br />- There is no C3 resistor, but there is a C4 resistor. The picture on NesCartDB shows a C3 but no C4 resistor. Mega Man 2 shows a C3 but no C4- and also no C2. <br /><br />That's quite a bit of difference between the information provided. Other than that, the board looks great. <br /><br />1. Can I still use this board as a donor?<br />2. When converting this 28 pin PRG-ROM to a 32 pin, is there anything I need to do differently than if it had a 32 pin chip to begin with?<br /><br /><br />Pictures:<br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/tFskrrk.jpg" class="postlink">Front of cartridge</a><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/HxWdfLY.jpg" class="postlink">Cartridge disassembled</a><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/ScvAwR7.jpg" class="postlink">Front of board</a><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/QkWIEZV.jpg" class="postlink">Rear of board</a>

I don't know what I'm doing [wrong] but...<br /><br />Tried my ROM, split with TNINES 2.6 into a single PRG file.<br /><br />Burned ROM to EPROM just fine... No errors. Used binary format, tried fill with '00' and 'FF'. Black screen.<br /><br />Then tried original Rad Racer, split, burned PRG. No worky.<br /><br /><br />I rechecked my hardware... <br />There are NO shorts or stray cable strands making contact with something they aren't supposed to be. <br />There aren't any socket pins that are shorted (I checked with a DMM before soldering to the board).<br />I even used a razor to ensure a gap between the ugly solder blobs, just in case.<br /><br />Here are the pinouts I am using: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/40591095/Chip%20Pinouts.pdf" class="postlink">Chip Pinouts.PDF</a> (I made this)<br />And here are some more pictures: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/TDtyk" class="postlink">http://imgur.com/a/TDtyk</a><br /><br />Unless anyone has an idea, I think my next step is to solder the socket directly to the board ...

I don't get it.<br /><br />I triple checked my wiring- everything is exactly how it should be according to the <a href="http://nesdev.com/NES%20ROM%20Pinouts.txt" class="postlink">PRG-ROM pinouts</a> and the <a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc0006.pdf" class="postlink">chip pinouts</a>. <br /><br />Maybe I am not burning the ROM correctly. I don't know. I've tried several ROMs and they all give a black screen, no 1Hz flash or anything. <br />The NES cart worked prior to modifying. <br />I am generally good with ESD practices.<br />I did not cut any traces.<br />My NES works fine with other games still.<br /><br />UGH.
