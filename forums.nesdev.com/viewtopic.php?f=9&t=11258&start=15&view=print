Clones have been known to have their problems due to incorrect cartridge port signal wiring and the audio duty cycle switch. But besides those issues they are more accurate than most emulators. And ofcourse they will work with any mapper if the cartridge port has all the appropriate signals connected. <br /><br />This Retron 5 is just an emulator which poses plenty of problems. Chances are they aren't using their own emulator but instead are using the source to an open source emulator and modifying it for their purposes. One thing they had to do on their own is figure out how to detect cartridges and their mappers so they can dump the ROM to load into the emulator. Maybe this aspect is not well engineered yet. I've heard it's using some sort of database to try to detect games by a checksum. We've had discussions before about how databases can be problematic with emulators due to homebrew and hacks. <br /><br />Ofcourse since this thing can be updated they can improve compatibility.<br /><br />Oh and ofcourse this will look way better on your HDTV than the Yobo or a real NES because it's outputting a much higher resolution and quality signal for the HDTV to work with. HDTV's do not do well with low resolution Composite video. They mainly support that for TV and Video, not low resolution computer graphics.

Again TVs upscale analog video with Television and Video (VHS/LaserDisc/DVD/Etc) in mind and not computer graphics. They do a poor job of handling it. So anything you can do to eliminate upscaling by the TV or give it a better quality signal to work with helps alot. <br /><br />And Tepples beat me to the issue with NameTables. People mistakenly think that these clones &quot;aren't accurate&quot; because various games do not work when infact they would work if the cartridge port was not wired incorrectly. These clones are very accurate as they aren't really reverse engineered, they are copies of the original chips. The only mistakes I'm aware of are some have the duty cycles reversed and some have the cartridge port signals incorrect affecting certain games. But other than that they are more accurate than many emulators and they run in real time like the real system does. So ofcourse unlike an emulator they should be able to run any cartridge with whatever mapper, barring problems with cartridge port signals being wired wrong.

The usb is next to two small holes with exposed copper not tinned maybe a jumper? The holes were in a white box labeled CN3 and one side had voltage when the retron was on. I think CN1 is a series of three small holes on the other side of the board one of which had voltage when the retron was on also. There are also quite a few circular copper pads with white circles around them that look like testpoints--although only the boards other than the mainboard had TP# labels.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />FWIW I've heard reports confirming that the retron5 detects mappers via checksum against a database.  Apparently all you have to do is ask them what the deal is on their facebook page and they will tell you whatever you want to know.<br /><br />So they're dumping some portion of what's usually a fixed bank, detecting the mapper based on some segement of a checksum (perhaps it's usually the last 8KB since most mappers have that fixed?  Then dumping the rest of the cart and playing it in their emulator.  So hacks, homebrews, perhaps some unlicensed carts, and anything which modifies that check sum'd segment won't work even if the mapper is supported as it doesn't know how to dump the cart.<br /><br />I've heard second hand that someone provided a hacked rom of a popular hacked title to hyperkin and they added that title to their supported list.  I'm planning on providing them with some titles I'm working with to help get them supported.  But apparently it's pretty easy, just ping their facebook and perhaps support email.  Now non-standard mappers like 28 for action53 will be a different story as they have to create mapper support, not just add it to their database.  But apparently they're interested in supporting everything, and have plans to detect the mapper via non-database means.  But who knows if that day will ever really come..  They've been getting a lot of flack for their database means of mapper support, so perhaps they are significantly motivated.<br /><br />Yes, I did receive these reports second hand, but I trust the source.  And if anyone questions it supposedly all you need to do is ask em via facebook.<br /><br />Furthermore, this method of operation also confirms that there is effectively zero chance of traditional flash carts like the powerpak and everdrive will ever be supported.  Because those devices rely on an menu to be operating via the NES/FC to load the mapper and roms.  Sounds like something like my old nesdev1 project would work though as the PC handles loading the roms and initializing the mapper and from the cart edge it just looks like that title provided it's in the database..
