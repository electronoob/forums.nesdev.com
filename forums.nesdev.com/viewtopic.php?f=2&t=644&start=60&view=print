<br />
<br />- I agree. Here's something hard to discuss: most of open-source emulators are NOT a great reference if you're writting an emulator too. Instead of something you could "read and learn", it's a bunch of cryptic files that makes sense for someone with high level and experience in C++ (not C) and someone that brings that things "by magic", without apparent reason. I can decipher some info, though most of the time it's useless.

<br />
<br />Are you saying you're reading the source code from a GPL licensed emulator and using that knowledge to write your own closed source emulator?

<br />I find it incredibly ironic that the past 4-5 posts in this thread (not from you, Fx3 :) ) are perfect examples of why I stopped involving myself with nesdev in general.  Sure, I still post here, but I just "drop by".

<br />Haha. We could use more feedback like this, I think.

<br />I think the problem with reading others' code is that you run the risk of accidentally copying some expression. See <em>Bright Tunes Music v. Harrisongs Music</em>, the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Sweet_Lord" class="postlink">My Sweet Lord</a>" case, for how this could play out.

<br />&lt;sarcarsm&gt;Of course, like copying the VBlank flag clearing on 2002h!&lt;/sarcarsm&gt;

<br />
<br />Umm... let's say you have a NES emulator that is open source and I poke around that source. Nothing much comes from it, but peering into a certain function enlightens me to something I did not previously realize.
<br />
<br />So I go about in my emulator, in another language, create my own function, my own way, from my new understanding.
<br />
<br />Have I gone and ripped your source code off? Pfft not likely.
<br />
<br />
<br />Now if I were to quite literally copy and paste it more or less, fair enough but I doubt most people would do that, or get very far if that's all they are capable of.
