		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey everyone, well its been almost a year or 2 since i have messed with any NES dev stuff, and i just recently dug up all my notes/info/charts etc. and i used to use a program called CajoNES for splitting my rom files and extracting the PRG and CHR files and it dont seem to work right anymore. Half the roms im trying to split, i keep getting the erro message saying cajones cant find the file or the directory even thouh its in the file with it?? Anyways i was just wondering wha other rom splitting programs there are out there, and what the easiest to use. Cajones was pretty eas to use, any new versions or anything? any help would be great. thanks!

<br />Is CajoNES an old DOS program? If so, it might have problems with long filenames. Try to rename the ROM to something with 8 letters (and keep your extensions with 3 letters) or less and try again.
<br />
<br />I wouldn't know what other program to recommend, as I do all my file splitting with an hex editor.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You can use <a href="http://www.filesplitter.org" class="postlink">File Splitter</a>, and calculate ROM banks (specified in the header) * $4000 + $10 and split from there (for CHR ROM only). There's no way to tell for CHR RAM. The only way to be pretty sure is look at the game in a hex editor. But if stuff looks slightly skewed, it might be because it starts at not a multiple of $10. In that case use the +1 or -1 buttons until it looks right.
<br />
<br />Also, you can download the CopyNES software from somewhere and it splits ROM images for you.

<br />Can you let me know if this works for you?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />hey guys! yep you nailed it on the head, it was having problems with the file names. i am trying to make a final fantasy 2 and had it titled as that........... i shortened it to FF2 and works perfect! ill try out the new cajones here in the next few days thanks a ton guys!
<br />
<br />BTW another yet simple question i used a legend of zelda board to try and make my FF2....... i did all the wiring correct but its not working. this is the first SNROM board ive ever done. and i was wondering aside from removing just the PRG maskrom, do i have to remove any other maskroms on the board?? i left them all on it besides the prg and just mirrored the FF2 PRG file on an eprom, soldered it following the wiring for snrom and it dont work, getting the grey screen?? any help would be awesome thanks so much!
<br />-Mark

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You were able to split FF2? That game has CHR RAM, so all the CHR data is embedded in PRG ROM, meaning there's no "equation" to take all of it out. Hmm, I wonder how that worked. Are you sure you got all of it?
<br />
<br />And also, regarding the other question you should start another thread. Possibly in the NES Hardware section. It's just to help this site to be better organized and easier to look through. And plus, your question will probably be answered faster. I don't know anything about it, so I can't really help you on it (sorry).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wait, you took out the CHR data and put it on an EPROM? If you did that to FF2, nothing would show up, because it uses CHR RAM. CHR RAM is an 8k chip on the board that you do manual writes to in order to have dynamic graphics. The data that they store into that chip is part of PRG ROM; it shouldn't be removed, because they manually store that data to the CHR RAM chip. But it works you say? How much PRG did you end up putting on the chip?

I didnt wire it right so i gotta try again. i just doubled up the PRG twice (512kb on the prg and put it in the board following the eprom conversions for a snrom board. Didnt do anything with the chr ram. thanks though for the help
