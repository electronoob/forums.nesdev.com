<br />
<br />The only problem is doing it right would be an immense amount of work.
<br />
<br />If I was to ever get into SNESdev, RPG might be something interesting to look at nonetheless.

<br />
<br />Well schools out in about a month, I'm going to try to get some programming done eventually as I haven't done any in a couple weeks....Once I get the sound engine done that I really need to work on, then I can start working on some engines and I'd love to do a simple RPG then just expand, expand, expand.
<br />
<br />
<br />Heck not even a RPG game 100%, maybe just more of a quest game "Fetch me ye item: (Item name here)" and find someone that you have to get something else for and then once you do like 3 things you have the items to trade off to the other people and get the items the other needs, make it a chain in some parts, I've never really seen a game do that, it's usually just one at a time.

<br />In fact nobody here has ever completed a full RPG (and the ones who completed full games completed like really SIMPLE games) so the trurth is that nonbody really knowns. You'd have to ask someone who completed many different games to be sure which genre is easier/harder.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I fooled around with RPG maker for the PS a while back and I thought the balancing things was pretty difficult.  Somethings to think about&#058;
<br />
<br />     Modern RPGs tend to have a smoother leveling flow.  The monsters you fight in one area are balanced enough that when you travel to another you are already leveled up enough to fight them. 
<br />
<br />     On the contrary, older RPGs focused heavily on leveling up and had large gaps in monster strength.  Remember the bridge in Dragon Warrior?  Ever get unlucky and end up getting your ass handed to you by the first monster party you met in DW or Final Fantasy? Also, sometimes you'd have to level up until you got a spell you needed.  Again, with Dragon Warrior, I remember a certain heal spell.
<br />
<br />     I made a choice (probably a mistake) of having variable party members you could gain or lose depending on your actions.  That means I had to test the dungeons for balance with each party iteration.
<br />
<br />     You have to think about balance, but honestly I don't think you'd have to think about it anymore than you <em>should</em> for any good game.

<br />
<br />DW, yes.  Then again that game was 99.9% grinding, and 0.1% actual game.
<br />
<br />FF, I disagree.  It's a lot more balanced than people give it credit for.  Maybe you have to fight around a <em>little</em> bit for LIT2 or something before you go to the Marsh Cave, but after than you can sail through the rest of the game without any grinding and it plays very fairly.

<br />
<br />I only had it as a rental as a kid (I think it was like 60 bucks) and the farthest I made it was beating Astos, so I guess that explains it.  Never tell your friends about a great rental where there is only one save.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, it helps if you know your way through the dungeons too, and which enemies are especially dangerous, and which enemies are worth spending your magic on.
<br />
<br />And it depends on the party you have, too.
<br />
<br />So I can see it seeming like it's too difficult for someone if they've never played it before.
<br />
<br />But that's kind of typical of every genre besides RPGs.  It's like there's some unwritten rule that if you ever actually die in an RPG, then it's too hard.  But other games you can die in all the time and it's no problem.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What dish says' heavily depends on who you have in your party. If you have 2 or more fighters, what he says is definitely true. If you only have one fighter a thief and 2 mages a lot of level building is needed. If you want to go without any fighters... good luck.
<br />
<br />Also this was about FF1, but FF2 has really really terrible balance, the game is barely playable (it was so obviously rushed and barely tested). I think a hack on romhacking.net fixes it tough.

<br />So in other words, you're cloning Animal Crossing for GameCube. That's a worthwhile project in its own right.
