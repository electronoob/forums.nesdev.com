<br />
<br />Well, you could stop double or triple posting; for some reason it gets on everyone's nerves. You could stop posting things like this:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4318">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4318</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Or stuff where you make the pages twice as wide as they should be, like here:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4298&amp;start=0">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopi ... 98&amp;start=0</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />And even though this is old, stuff like this:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4081">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4081</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Those are just some suggestions.
<br />
<br />EDIT: And also, keeping your personal life/health problems more private, and not making them so public. We do like to know that our community members aren't dead, so just saying "I have some health issues" should be enough rather than going into more detail.

<br />Just like flies are really annoying, you just smash them without finding a pretext so that they break rules. It's pretty much the same with jargon.
<br />
<br />After all rules are a way to technically say if someone shoud be blamed or not, but there is no way to technically say if that person really was to blame.
<br />
<br />What tepples seems not to understand, is that as a matter of a fact it is perfectly possible to be a total jackass while following all laws in the world (G.W. Bush), and it's also possible to break multiples rules and yet do something really honorable (Robin's hood). Anyone who has ever played Dungeon &amp; Dragons should understand what I'm saying there.

<br />Tip to mods: When there are two independant "Should we ban jargon?" polls, that should tell you something.
<br />
<br />FWIW, I don't really care about jargon anymore, he seems to have mellowed out lately.  But even if he's a perfect saint, if every post of his encourages a flurry of follow-up bickering posts, he should go anyway, for the sake of keeping the peace here.

Perhaps if we gave the topic "ban jargon" less attention, he'd quiet down.

<br />If only the bickerers would mellow out in the same way. It makes it difficult to see who's the real dick: user A, or user B for calling user A a dick.
<br />
<br />But this time, I've noticed that jargon has abused General Stuff, in addition to all the other alleged dickery. So I'm putting him in time-out for two weeks, the same amount of time as the breaks I took when I made big faux pas on alt.aol-sucks and on tetrisconcept.com. He can appeal this when I'm online (try the AIM and ICQ buttons below). If he wants to prepare his tutorial, he can do so on NESdevWiki, where he hasn't caused any controversy yet.

<br />For the record, jargon -- and many other people can hold me to this.  I don't hate you and I'm sure most people don't "hate" you.  Others can surely vouch for me that administrative decisions (such as in #nesdev) were made not as personal attacks, but as majority consensus appeal.
<br />
<br />I think people just really don't like how you appear to be entirely incapable of (1) <em>apologizing</em>, (2) <em>showing a submissive, learning, role, when you have little to nothing to teach</em>, and (3) <em>absolute inconsideration of others and for the community</em>.
<br />
<br />First off, I apologize if these statements are slightly more strong than they need be.
<br />
<br />I humbly request to jargon:  Lurk, man.  Lurk.  You have been chilling out lately like loopy says.  I do see that.  I don't <strong>at all</strong> mean to irritate you, so I wouldn't appreciate a response of negative intent.
<br />
<br />And a humble request to administrators:  I know as jargon has said, I do focus too much on this instead of contributing to other threads.  (It's because unlike jargon of the past, I don't have much to contribute so I haven't been.)  I say kill this thread and the other against jargon -- no need to really tidy up posts -- and just let this thing ride out as it is, hopefully forever.  However, if it goes back to how it was, please just get rid of jargon and do NOT remove the ban.
<br />
<br />I am officially NOT talking about this any more.  No matter the bait from anyone.

<br />3. my neruologist thinks my experiences of "temporal displacements" are caused by "retinal migranes" i might have, (he is still running tests, have yet to hear results regarding the last EEG.)

<br />The EEG itself didn't go so well i assume, i was supposed to be asleep with theta (?) brainwave activity while dreaming during most of it, but that didn't work out. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
