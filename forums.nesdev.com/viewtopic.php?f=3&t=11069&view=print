		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi everyone,<br /><br />I am in the process of adding sprite support after implementing cycle-accurate PPU rendering for backgrounds - I have a few questions regarding sprites and I'm sure some of you may be able to help.<br /><br />1) First of all, I saw in the wiki that during sprite evaluation, sprites *in the next scanline* are copied from primary to secondary OAM if they are &quot;in range&quot;. I assume this means if (ppu_v + 1 &gt;= sprite_y) &amp;&amp; (ppu_v + 1 &lt; sprite_y + sprite_height). I am unsure about the &quot;ppu_v + 1&quot; instead of &quot;ppu_v&quot;, could you please confirm?<br /><br />2) My second question is in regards to the sprite fetching phase. As the circuitry probably does not keep track of how many sprites were actually copied to secondary OAM, I assume it parses all the 8 possible visible sprites no matter what. I saw on the wiki that if the tile number is detected as 0xFF, it fills the high and low registers with transparent data. What about the attributes and the X counter? Does it also fill them as if it was a visible sprite? That would mean both attribute and X counter latches would contain 0xFF. Is that correct?<br /><br />3) Another issue I noticed is that my sprites are all shifted by 16 pixels to the left. After some debugging, I realized what caused this issue but I'm not sure on how to fix this in a clear fashion. Here's the problem: during sprite fetching, the sprite X counters are reloaded. The wiki mentions that every cycle, a bit is fetched from the 4 BG shift registers. Down below, it also mentions that every cycle, the 8 x-positions counters for the sprites are decremented by one. The obvious issue that I encountered is that the X counters start decrementing on the same scanline as the sprite fetching phase, because I included the decrementing logic &quot;as part&quot; of the background shifting logic (the BG shifters also shift between cycles 322 and 337, which is why I have a sprite offset). If I add a check for only decrementing the X counters between cycles 2 and 257 (included), then the problem disappears. If this is the right way to implement this, then this means that what the wiki considers &quot;every cycle&quot; is actually different for background and sprites. Can you please confirm this?<br /><br />4) I would also like to understand if the X counter decrementing logic happens *after* checking if the X counter is 0 (and becoming active) or before. Basically, that would mean that if a sprite X counter is 0 after the sprite fetching phase and the decrementing happens before check its value, the X counter would be 0xFF resulting  in the sprite never being drawn. Is that correct?<br /><br />5) Lastly, I would like to make sure that the X counter decrementing logic starts indeed at cycle 2 or if it should start at 0.<br /><br />That's all I have for now! Looking forward to your responses.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Sebastien

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi Quietust,<br /><br />Thank you for the answers!<br /><br />A few comments/questions:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">There's nothing special about tile 0xFF; rather, it would likely be &quot;sprite_y == 0xFF&quot; that prevents the sprite from being rendered.<br /></div><br />This makes sense - I was confused by this on the wiki: &quot;If there are less than 8 sprites on the next scanline, then dummy fetches to tile $FF occur for the left-over sprites, because of the dummy sprite data in the secondary OAM (see sprite evaluation). This data is then discarded, and the sprites are loaded with a transparent bitmap instead&quot;. I then assume it is discarded not because of tile 0xFF but because of the first byte (sprite_y) which was 0xFF.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It wouldn't make any sense to clock the sprite X counters during anything other than cycles 1-256 (i.e. the ones during which actual rendering is happening); however, due to pipelining within the PPU, the actual sprite pixels don't make it to the screen until a few cycles later.<br /></div><br />Makes sense as well, thank you.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The sprite X counters do not decrement if they are already zero - they simply stay at zero and cause the sprite pixels themselves to start shifting out to the renderer (and after 8 pixels, they just continue to output &quot;transparent&quot;).<br /></div><br />Thanks for the clarification.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">See response to #3 - it actually starts at cycle 1.<br /></div><br />This is what I am unclear about. To make it easy, I'm going to take the example of background rendering. I was under the impression that the pixel is actually generates when data &quot;comes out&quot; of the background shifters, which happens at cycle 2 (the wiki mentions the shifters start shifting at cycle 2). Due to the PPU pipeline, the pixels get rendered some cycles later (cycle 4 I believe). Are you saying that the pixel is actually generated at cycle 1, and the shifters shift at cycle 2 *after* it is already on its way out? I am not sure this would impact anything really, but I'd love to double-check this part.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If you want your implementation to be 100% correct, you should probably be comparing it directly to Visual 2C02 (though you'd also need to be careful of any bugs in the simulator - if you see any, please let me know).<br /></div><br />I should definitely spend the time to verify this, you're right. I started checking Visual 2C02 before starting my work on the PPU and found it pretty cryptic <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> It should now be an easier ride.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to help!<br /><br />Regards,<br />Sebastien
