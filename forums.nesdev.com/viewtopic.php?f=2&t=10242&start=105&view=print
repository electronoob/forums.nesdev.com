He's just only had demand so far for the color dreams board. And there's only 50Â¢ difference between what he charges for the MMC1 and discrete logic reproductions.</div><br />TL;DR: I'm working to make NROM and discrete mapper fully assembled flash boards more efficiently than my current means.  I can make any of these on request, just send me a PM email of what you'd like and we can discuss specifics of that board/mapper.<br /><br />Yeah I haven't focused a lot on getting the discrete mappers to market a whole lot up to this point.  The colordreams was requested by several people so I put it up even though I hadn't specifically designed support for it with my v1 eprom boards.  After completing my v2 flash boards I recognized I kind of neglected the idea of a simple flashable discrete mapper board.  I just ordered another batch of my smaller v2 full flash boards that'll be available in ~month.  I added jumpers for cutting the flash down to NROM size and also have BNROM support.  I've had a lot of requests for a simple flashable boards for discrete mappers and NROM as of late with more people becoming aware of my projects.  Today I've come to realize it would make things simpler to just have a dedicated NROM/Discrete mapper flash board.  That'll keep things cleaner from a manufacturing standpoint and allow for significantly fewer jumpers.  Not sure when I'll have those ready, but I'm hoping for early next year.  I can make any of these boards today fully assembled with flash or in a eprom version.  The flash versions just wouldn't be as efficient as I'd like in the end.  Sorry I'm realizing that may have made things even more complicated... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In uc65 you'll have to implement different code to target different mappers. As of today I don't have any of the memory mappers implemented as libraries because I haven't quite gotten around to it yet <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Let me know which ones you want and I'll make them a priority.<br /><br />Color Dreams has no fixed PRG bank, and I don't have any examples for that type of setup yet. That gets a bit interesting <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />So here's the basic pattern. First, declare the data or code you wish to bank swap in the swap-able bank. For instance, a 128KB UNROM board would have bank 7 as the fixed upper bank, and banks 0-6 swap-able.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">rom 0<br />export sub level1BossAI<br />end sub<br />rom 1<br />export sub level2BossAI<br />end sub<br /></div><br /><br />Then you'd need to call a bank swap routine for the memory mapper from the fixed bank and call the banked sub.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">rom 7<br />export sub main<br />&nbsp; if level == 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; uxromBank 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; level1BossAI<br />&nbsp; else if level == 2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; uxromBank 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; level2BossAI<br />&nbsp; end if<br />end sub<br /></div><br /><br />There's better ways of doing the above, but it serves as a hello world type of example.<br /><br />So now, I suppose I'd better get on the stick with implementing mapper support, examples and tutorials <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Thanks for the push Slobu!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, for the same reasons I didn't want to model the language too closely to C, I'm trying not to make it too close to BASIC so folks won't get freaked out when things like for and multiply don't work. Changing the compiler would be a lot easier than changing the examples and documentation though <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Also, please understand that uc65 is not targeted at novice users. It's really an assembler on steroids, and requires a deep understanding of the hardware and underlying cc65 tool-chain to use effectively. If you want something that's more friendly, there's cc65 itself which implements a fairly complete C implementation, and has been used successfully on several projects.<br /><br />Here's <a href="http://shiru.untergrund.net/articles/programming_nes_games_in_c.htm" class="postlink">Shiru's article on the subject</a> which links to basic texts to get you going, and then dives into the finer points of how to make things more efficient.<br /><br />The only down sides to cc65 are that 1) with great power comes great complexity, and code that isn't as fast or small as it could be, and 2) it doesn't deal with banking at all. But those are the trade-offs you make for the ease of development. This project was started in response to these issues, to explore if it was possible to eliminate the trade-offs while keeping the ease of development. As it turns out, no, no it's not. uc65 is much harder to develop in than C, but much easier than assembly (once you know it anyway). The generated code is faster and smaller than what comes out of cc65, but not quite as good as what you can do by hand.<br /><br />I think uc65 may be a useful tool because it tightly integrates with inline assembly, handles banked data, code and variables and is well documented.<br /><br />These may or may not fit your needs or use cases.

I've read this topic enough to realize you had some of your own internal struggles as to what uc65 is.<br /><br />From what I've seen of your code here and in the main.uc examples it's almost exactly like batari BASIC for the Atari 2600.  BASIC is about clarity - functionality without getting bogged down in syntax and form.  I think you've got a great start.<br /><br />Maybe I just don't get what the key word &quot;export&quot; means in C and asm.  Now that I take a closer look it seems that it's used to do more than declare a sub-routine?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The export keyword makes whatever it applies to, be that a type, variable or subroutine, visible from other source files that use the import statement to reference the source file that defines them. This is how uc65 supports splitting your code into multiple files as well as encapsulation.<br /><br />At the lower level, variables and subroutines defined with the export keyword also receive exports in the generated assembly files, which makes them visible to other assembly files at link-time without having to reference the source code. This is how C implements static libraries.

NESICIDE's Windows installers already come with cc65 toolchain and GNU Make for Windows, and it builds/exports its own makefiles for projects, and invokes them.  There wasn't any response, though, so I forgot all about it.  As I said in that post, I'm all for providing alternatives and trying to make things easier for people...but I myself likely won't be a &quot;user&quot; of uc65 [unless and until I actually get to the point of trying to create something for the NES] so I'd need help/feedback to make sure the integration of NESICIDE and uc65 is useful and &quot;user friendly&quot; -- to address the &quot;daunting/near impossible&quot; concern.

The intent was never to provide a user-friendly development environment, it was to provide a more efficient, in terms of development effort, development tool that was reasonably efficient in terms of resource utilization on the target platform. And as I've said countless times, uc65 is a drop-in replacement for cc65 in the tool chain. If you don't know how to compile C sources with cc65, you won't be able to compile uc sources with uc65.<br /><br />On the subject of make.sh in the recent source release, this requires a recent version of Bash (version 2 at least, preferably version 3+). This was never intended as a full-on build solution, it was just a quickie I threw together for testing purposes because I haven't settled on a build management solution to adopt yet. It will not be supported in the near future.<br /><br />On the subject of NESICIDE integration, you are free to do as you wish with the sources of uc65. It's all open source. But until I get more of the build management details nailed down it's going to be a moving target.<br /><br />So there's something to learn here: a lot of folks have the expectation that uc65 should be user-friendly, and a key sore spot on the user-friendliness aspect is the lack of a &quot;go button&quot;. As I have said before, I do not want to get into the business of maintaining a build management system, but I will work to include official support for an existing build manager.<br /><br />Thank you all for your input!
