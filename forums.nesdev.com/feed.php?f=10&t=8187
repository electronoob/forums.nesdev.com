The main trouble I had in learning assembly was figuring out what the instructions actually did, and how these things could be used to put together a program that did many things.  But I eventually did.  Still, understanding it requires some effort.<br /><br />But yeah, I can also help if you have any questions, as can others here.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=119">doppelganger</a> — Tue Oct 25, 2011 7:20 pm</p><hr />

You're forgetting that 6502 is built to be simple and isn't x86 assembly. You should go through the first few Nerdy Nights tutorials and learn how the 6502 works and you'll see it's really, really simple. I know it requires a certain way of thinking that is rare for even other programmers, but still when you can think that way, it becomes really straightforward and simple. IMO, if you'll take the dive and just go through the first 6502 assembly tutorials, even if you learn it you can make a more educated decision of what is right for you. Just saying you don't wanna learn and use 6502 because x86 is total garbage isn't that good of an ide, heh. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Wed Oct 05, 2011 6:44 pm</p><hr />

I really started learning C when i used the gameboy advance devkit called 'Hamlib' The original site seems to be down but you should be able to find the dev kit around (i think it was eventually given away freely.)

(At least not in a way that would be preferred by you)<br /><br />I think your preconceptions are making it seem harder than it is. You can actually make assembly very easy for yourself. Let's pretend this is the only way to do things. Can you deal with it then, or will you give up?

I don't think there is a way to motivate me. I'm personally don't need such a tutorial, and also I highly doubt that there is target audience that would be actually able to make games, but the only thing that stop them is lack of a tutorial.<br /><br />Regarding your joke on BASIC, I've said 'compiler'. The two I mentioned are compilers, not interpreters. So they aren't slow. And C on NES is not fast as well, compiled BASIC and C are pretty much comparable in this case.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Wed Oct 05, 2011 11:13 am</p><hr />

I started out with Z80, then moved to ARM, then moved to 6502.  Knowing any assembly helps you learn another.  And knowing ARM makes 6502 easier.  Only real problem is that the carry flag is the opposite on Z80 vs 6502/ARM.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Wed Oct 05, 2011 8:29 am</p><hr />

That's because it is really major amount of work that only would help very few people - my methods aren't really suitable for newcomers (like, I don't use any IDEs; my tools aren't really comfortable, etc).<br /><br />Also, even with C and low-level library, you still need to learn assembly and NES hardware to some extent, to be able to solve all the kinds of problems that could arise in the process. I still don't think that C is easier to use than ASM on NES - it could simplify certain parts, but generally things aren't developed well enough, like, say, on PC, you can't just forget about low-level things. You can't even write in proper C for NES, you have to follow certain limitations to make resulting code faster (no local vars, for example).<br /><br />I think that some kind of an integer BASIC compiler actually would be better entry-level tool for NES, something like bAtari BASIC (Atari 2600) or BasiEgaXorz (Sega Genesis).<br /><br /><br />By the way, you can structure your ASM code with macros, making it more readable. Like, make a macros set_score(n), add_score(n) that will contain needed code, and then you can just use these as a kind of a function.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Wed Oct 05, 2011 5:47 am</p><hr />
