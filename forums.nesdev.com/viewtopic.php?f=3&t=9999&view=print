Here are two (semi-)related questions:<br /><br />1. What's the ideal PPU/CPU alignment to assume in an emulator? One where the the CPU and PPU ticks line up like below? (Alignments where they don't line up nicely are possible since the PPU divides the master clock by 4.)<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&#91;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CPU&nbsp; tick&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#93;&#91;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CPU&nbsp; tick&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#93;<br />&#91;PPU tick&#93;&#91;PPU tick&#93;&#91;PPU tick&#93;&#91;PPU tick&#93;&#91;PPU tick&#93;&#91;PPU tick&#93;<br /></div><br /><br />2. When the wiki says e.g. &quot;reading one PPU clock before reads it as clear and never sets the flag or generates NMI for that frame&quot; (on <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_frame_timing">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_frame_timing</a><!-- m -->), is that referring to a situation like below?<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">CPU: &#91;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Read $2002&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#93;<br />PPU: &#91;............&#93;&#91;Set VBL flag&#93;&#91;............&#93;<br /></div><br /><br />If so, does that mean that there's no special-case behavior for e.g.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">CPU: &#91;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Read $2002&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#93;<br />PPU: &#91;............&#93;&#91;............&#93;&#91;Set VBL flag&#93;<br /></div><br /><br />? (I.e., will that read the flag as false and later set it and generate an NMI?)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Seconded. The snag is that this basically requires testing all CPU-PPU timings thoroughly for the other three alignments, or else the emulator will be less accurate than using the preferred one.<br /><br />I tested the four alignments and mapped them to the previous findings. The top trace is the PPU's ALE, the bottom M2 out of the 2A03. Note that the ALE is effectively overlaid on itself offset by one PPU clock, such that it shows every PPU clock rather than every other one (normally ALE occurs every two PPU clocks). This is because the scope is triggering on the CPU's M2, and you get 1.5 ALE pulses for every M2. This is exactly what we want since it shows every PPU clock. So it's all good. And yeah, there's not the best connection to the CPU's M2, as shown by the ripple when it's low.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">After power/reset, PPU is randomly in one of four synchronizations with CPU. This synchronization cannot be changed without resetting/powering down. Trials of 50-60 power/resets were done to determine likelihoods. The third synchronization is the preferred one for emulators and test ROMs, due to the least special cases. Also, the three-digit codes are just something specific to my tests that help identify each alignment; the numbrs of no significance worth explaining.<br /><br />&#91;code&#93;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NMI&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;VBL&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hit&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Overflow&nbsp; &nbsp; Likelihood<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reset&nbsp; &nbsp;Reset&nbsp; &nbsp;Set&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reset&nbsp; &nbsp;Set<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6819+&nbsp; &nbsp;7502+&nbsp; &nbsp;6819+&nbsp; &nbsp;7290+&nbsp; &nbsp;Power&nbsp; &nbsp;Reset<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />632&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 27%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;26%<br />732&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;22%<br />742&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;31%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30%<br />743&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;27%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;22%</div><br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nq78U8I.gif" alt="Image" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry, I'm only now noticing your specific questions.<br /><br />1. We don't know yet what the signal level looks like for each alignment. The tests I've done are for the &quot;742&quot; one, which has the most common timing to all four. I don't know what this corresponds to physically. The order they're listed in the table earlier was confirmed by the scope check yesterday to be in the correct order, where each one is the next in the same &quot;direction&quot; of relative alignments.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">2. When the wiki says e.g. <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_frame_timing" class="postlink">&quot;reading one PPU clock before reads it as clear and never sets the flag or generates NMI for that frame&quot;</a>, is that referring to a situation like below?</div><br />It means that if you keep reading it earlier and earlier in the frame, at some point you'll read it as set, and one PPU clock before that you'll read it as clear AND suppress the NMI for that frame. And again, this is for the &quot;742&quot; alignment. I'm not positive, but I believe that at least one other alignment has this suppression on reading one and two PPU clocks before this point. Possibly also one where you read it as clear and it keeps it from being set for the frame, but the NMI still occurs. See how much fun it is to try to cover all four alignments? four variants of each test ROM, perhaps using SRAM to be sure you've tested all four power-on/reset alignments (askng you to press reset until it gets to the next alignment it wants to test... hmmm, this would be a nice test that would eliminate all emulators from passing for now).

I.e., does a -1 mean that you see the change one PPU tick earlier in that alignment compared to an alignment that has 0? (Or equivalently, that you can start reading one PPU tick earlier and see it.)<br /><br />And do the timings for sprite 0 account for the fact that sprite 0 hits treat the image as starting as h=2 (while other flags like vbl are set/cleared at h=1)?<br /><br />(Not sure if you saw my other post above, but just in case <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> )
