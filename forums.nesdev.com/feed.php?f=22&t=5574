You are right, I didn't think of how to scroll down. Shifting one row up, like you said, will work, but this means that the topmost row of the new screen will have to be copied over the black bar in the visible NT, and the copying continues downwards, wrapping to the top.<br /><br />IMO it works perfectly both ways. I think that the original games scroll slower than 8 scanlines per frame, but if you want to keep it glitch free I think you should use 8 anyway, even if you scroll 8 scanlines every 2 frames, to make it slower. In fact, if timing is a problem, you could use 1 frame for reading the data from the hidden NT, and the next frame for writing it to the visible NT.<br /><br />This is the easiest solution I can think of, that doesn't require modifications to your current BG rendering engine and that doesn't need special PPU tricks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Jan 19, 2010 12:19 pm</p><hr />

Anyway, tokumaru's solution seems a good one for banshaku's problem in my opinion - altough I don't think it's exactly what MM1&amp;2 does (they don't shift the screen one row lower or anything). Also tokumarus animation is only for the case of scrolling up, it would have to be adapted when scrolling down.<br /><br />The following algorithm could work for Banshaku :<br />- Before scrolling up or down, decode the next map and write it into the invisible nametable<br />- While scrolling, "copy" data in real time from the invisible nametable to the visible one : Going upwards and shifting one row down when climbing up, and going downwards and shifting one row up when clibming down<br />- Once all scrolling is done ($e8 -&gt; $d8 when doing down, or $e8-&gt;$08 when going up), exchange which nametable is active, and decode the next screen on the inactive nametable<br />- Gameplay can resume<br /><br />As far I see it there is 2 ways the "copying" could be done, either by decoding the level data rows and write them to the nametable (as it would normally be done), or by reading the nametable via $2007, and write data back.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Jan 19, 2010 11:59 am</p><hr />

Well I also never fully understood how MM1 and MM2 scrolls, but I guess they do the following :<br />- When scrolling horizontally, always load data from the next screen and write it to VRAM (even if it's impossible to scroll to it)<br />- When finished fast-scrolling vertically, load data from the following screen so that it's ready to scroll horizontally.<br /><br />I don't think it ever "copies" data from one nametable to the other - it just happen that when scrolling vertically the data from the map above or below the one Megaman was is already in VRAM. In fact there is some case in MM2 where this is not the case I belive. I might be wrong tough.<br /><br />Aside of that tokumaru's suggetion is a good one if you don't want to add a 15th row. Altough you'd need a piece of code to write metatiles one row lower (which implies crossing attribute nybbles) - but that's nothing really overcomplicated I think.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Jan 19, 2010 8:08 am</p><hr />

I guess my comment is quite unclear actually and I should rephrase it. What I meant is in map 1, the black bar is at the bottom. So you have to scroll the Y at $E8 to split it as 1 tile row at the top and one at the bottom to hide them. When you write the next map this way, 2 small things changes (but not big): the black bar is now at the top and where you will need to start to write metatile in the NT changed too. So you have to keep track of those 2 details. It's a very small compromise that could simplify a lot of the screen transition so I will consider this scrolling system since it quite simple.<br /><br />For the buffering of the next map, this was just a test I did so I could start to try to do some quick experimenting for map transitions. I'm not sure if I will keep it that way.  In MM2, when the screen finish to scroll, the next possible screen is loaded in the hidden NT. Maybe I should try to check what MM1 did since the process was similar.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Tue Jan 19, 2010 6:22 am</p><hr />

@Bregalad:<br /><br />I should be able to add this extra running frame when mega man land.  The frame is so fast that you have a hard time to see it, if you ever see it at all thought. I only saw it when doing some frame per frame analysis with Nintendulator.  I never could discern it in the real MM9 jumping animation but I could be wrong.  It's a small fix so I will do it for the sake of completeness. <br /><br />@Tepples:<br /><br />I checked the code and it seems to rely on precise timing to do the job. There is no code in the NMI or anything else. What would happen if you use this trick with a sound engine and other things running in the nmi a the same time, hmmm..<br /><br />@Tokumaru:<br /><br />Like you mentioned and I remember seeing it once while testing it, MM1 does a similar trick for scrolling. I will think about it as one possibility. The only draw back is now you have to keep track of the starting location of the map to re-adjust the scroll so you won't see the black bars. This affect the metatile column drawing a little bit.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />For the screen already decoded, I didn't do much.

OK, I gave some more thought to my idea and I think I have the answer. I don't know at what rate (how many pixels per frame) the original game scrolls vertically, but if you are OK with 8 pixels per frame, my method can work without any glitches.<br /><br />Here's an animated GIF of the process:<br /><br /><img src="http://img195.imageshack.us/img195/5169/megamanscroll.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I saw that you already have the new screen completely decoded by the time MM reaches the ladder, so it will be even easier. Every frame you copy a row of tiles from the hidden NT to the visible one, and blank the two scanlines immediately above it (this will keep the top and bottom 8 scanlines of the screen always black). Just do this until all rows are copied (you don't need to copy the 2 blank ones, because you are already blanking 2 rows above the each one copied).<br /><br />The only thing that's slightly complicated about this process is that attributes can't be directly copied from one side to the other because the screens are offset by half an attribute block. So every 2 rows of tiles copied from the hidden side you have to take the corresponding attribute bytes, move the nibbles to the other half of the byte so that they can be inserted at the correct place in the other NT. Not complicated at all really, just slithly annoying to code.<br /><br />Well, this is it. If you think 8 pixels per frame is OK when scrolling vertically I'm sure this is the most straightforward way to do it, and much easier than messing with sprite 0 hits, IRQs and mid-frame scroll changes.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Jan 18, 2010 5:51 pm</p><hr />

The most obvious way complicates map updates: you're splitting map writes across the bottom and top of the nametable all the time.<br /></div><br />I was gonna suggest the same thing, because I don't know if you can guarantee a sprite 0 hit every time (what if a particular screen has transparent background where the hit is supposed to happen?).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Banshaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I guess I'm not in the mood for re-factoring (again) the scrolling<br /></div><br />I just though of a trick that won't require any refactoring, or IRQs. I looked at how MM1 does it, and it first decodes the new screen horizontally (apparently the decoding is meant to work horizontally only) to the hidden NT, and then copies it to the visible one row by row as the screen scrolls up. What if you do the exact same thing, but when copying from the hidden NT to the visible one you skip the unused row?<br /><br />What I mean is, the screen that is decoded to the hidden NT is perfectly aligned vertically, but when you copy it for the scrolling sequence the copy is not aligned, but once the scrolling sequence is over you can set the scrolling to show the other NT where you copied the data from, which IS aligned vertically, so you can continue scrolling from it without a single change to your scrolling engine.<br /><br />Let me show it with drawings, which are much better than words. Here is Mega Man going up some stairs:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">+------------+------------+<br />|  &#40;hidden&#41;  |           -|<br />|            |           M|<br />|            |           -|<br />|            |           -|<br />|            |FFFFFFFFFFFF|<br />|            |FFFFFFFFFFFF|<br />|            S............|<br />+------------+------------+</div><br />The floor is "F", Mega Man is "M" and "............" is the blank row of blocks. The left NT is hidden because the scroll is at "S". OK, when MM touches the top of the screen, you decode the screen that goes on top of the current one to the hidden NT like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">+------------+------------+<br />|           -|           M|<br />|  -FFFFFFFFF|           -|<br />|  -         |           -|<br />|  -         |           -|<br />|  FFFFFFFFF-|FFFFFFFFFFFF|<br />|  FFFFFFFFF-|FFFFFFFFFFFF|<br />|............S............|<br />+------------+------------+</div><br />Yup, with the blank row at the bottom, so it's aligned as your scrolling engine likes it. Now you copy the contents of the hidden NT to the visible one row by row as you scroll up, but shifted one row down so that there is no empty row between the screens:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">+------------+------------+<br />|           -S............|<br />|  -FFFFFFFFF|           -|<br />|  -         |  -FFFFFFFFF|<br />|  -         |  -         |<br />|  FFFFFFFFF-|  -         |<br />|  FFFFFFFFF-|  FFFFFFFFF-|<br />|............|  FFFFFFFFFM|<br />+------------+------------+</div><br />So now you've scrolled to the top and the whole new scree is visible, but it's not vertically aligned to the NT, but the left side is perfectly aligned and has the same contents, so you can just move the scroll to it and continue as if nothing happened:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">+------------+------------+<br />|           -|............|<br />|  -FFFFFFFFF|           -|<br />|  -         |  -FFFFFFFFF|<br />|  -         |  -         |<br />|  FFFFFFFFF-|  -         |<br />|  FFFFFFFFFM|  FFFFFFFFF-|<br />S............|  FFFFFFFFF-|<br />+------------+------------+</div><br />Mirroring is set to vertical all the time, no need to change it.<br /><br />The thing you do have to worry about no matter what solution you pick (sprite 0, IRQs or my suggestion) are the black borders. You do have a black border at the top, but when scrolling you want the next screen to connect to the current one without gaps. With whatever method you use, the black border will turn into actual tiles when scrolling vertically, and once the scrolling is done the borders will come back. I guess the only way to avoid this is using IRQs to mask the top and bottom 8 scanlines, but IMO this is a lot of work and you're better off simply accepting some garbage at the edges (which several official MM games have - not 9, for obvious reasons).<br /><br />Oh, one thing I forgot to mention about my method is that although the rows of tiles can be copied directly from one NT to the other, you will need to do some nibble work on the attributes, but honesty, that shouldn't be hard at all.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Jan 18, 2010 2:50 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Banshaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Tested all nes version of mega man very fast and for the jump, 1 to 5 doesn't enter the floor but 6 does (why). One thing they all do but I don't is that before touching the floor, they go 1 frame in running state then stop moving. In my own code, if there if no button pressed, I go standing right away, if not, I just run. I guess they did it that way to simplify the logic. I may change it later too if it does make it simpler.<br /></div><br />This is what I was talking about. Sorry, but I think it's very important you make Mega Man landing correctly. It really makes the animation smoother to have it landing on both of his feet before standing up. You do that when you jump in real life too (you absorb the energy in your knees instead of your back).<br /><br />I don't know what to suggest for the vertical scrolling. A raster effect is certainly possible (writing $00 twice to $2006 when you'd encounter the "black bar" should do the trick) - the hard part is that the time you'd do the write will scroll across the whole screen so you'd want to wait for the sprite zero hit BEFORE the frame logic if it's in the first half of the screen, and AFTER the frame logic if it's in the lower half. This assumes the frame logic takes less than 50% of the CPU.<br /><br />Otherwise I'd say create data for 15 rows or just deal with 14 rows and non-aligned level to nametable - I deal with screejs non-aligned vertically with nametable in my game, but aligned horizontally, as it would be your case. You just need a few more variables to know where the topleft of the screen is in the nametable, and code able to split attribute blocks in lower/upper half.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Jan 18, 2010 7:34 am</p><hr />
