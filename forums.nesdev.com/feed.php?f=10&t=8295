Congrats!<br /><br />The first thing you should do is start naming your labels and variables more meaningful things.<br /><br />SkipBounceRight2? Why not SkipBounceLeft? It is not a good habit to copy and paste things and change just enough so it works right. If you read your code later, you'll have to think twice as hard about what the code is doing.<br /><br />MovePaddle1y<br />DownPaddle1y<br /><br />Why not UpPaddle1y? The labels should be immediately clear. Related code should follow a format.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">paddle1y   .rs 1;This one's labeling doesn't match the others.<br />paddle12  .rs 1;These could be read as PaddleTwelve<br />paddle13  .rs 1;PaddleThirteen<br />paddle14  .rs 1;PaddleFourteen<br />;Which hides their purpose a little bit.<br /></div><br />You actually don't need paddle12, paddle13, and paddle14 at all.<br /><br />Right now you are using 4 zero page RAM locations for each paddle's y position.<br /><br />This has two problems: <br />1. You have to update all 4 every time the paddle moves.<br />2. You're using 3 more bytes of zero page RAM than you need.<br /><br />You can update only one byte of RAM that contains the actual Y position of the paddle:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">MovePaddle1y:<br />  LDA buttons1<br />  AND #%00001000<br />  BEQ MovePaddle1yDone<br /><br />  LDA paddle1y<br />  SEC <br />  SBC #$01<br />  STA paddle1y<br />MovePaddle1yDone:<br /></div><br /><br />Then do this when you update the sprites:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">  LDA paddle1y;Paddle1y is in A.<br />  STA $0204<br />  <br />  LDY #$37;We're using Y instead of A<br />  STY $0205;Because A holds a value we'll add to<br />;For the other sprites in the paddle.<br />  LDY #$00<br />  STY $0206<br /><br />  LDY #$08<br />  STY $0207<br /><br />;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;<br />  CLC<br />  ADC #$08;We've added 8 to the top y position. <br />  STA $0208;Paddle1y+8 is in A.<br />  <br />  LDY #$47<br />  STY $0209<br /><br />  LDY #$00<br />  STY $020A<br /><br />  LDY #$08<br />  STY $020B<br /><br />;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;<br /><br />  CLC<br />  ADC #$08;Paddle1y+16 is in A.<br />  STA $020C<br />  <br />  LDY #$57<br />  STY $020D<br /><br />  LDY #$00<br />  STY $020E<br /><br />  LDY #$08<br />  STY $020F<br /><br />;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;<br /><br />  CLC<br />  ADC #$08;Paddle1y+24 is in A.<br />  STA $0210<br />  <br />  LDY #$67<br />  STY $0211<br /><br />  LDY #$00<br />  STY $0212<br /><br />  LDY #$08<br />  STY $0213<br /></div><br />That updates all the sprites properly without the extra RAM.<br /><br />In fact, you can take it a little further. I said earlier that anytime you need to duplicate complicated code, it's probably worth turning it into a subroutine. Right now you have the "update paddle sprites" code duplicated for each paddle.<br /><br />You can make a subroutine using the ,x addressing mode. <br /><br />lda $0200,x loads the value at the location $02XX. If X is FF it loads from $02FF.<br />If X is 8, it loads $0208.<br /><br />Remember how we had to put things in temp RAM to set up our checkcollision routine? Here we need to do some setup, but we'll just use A, X,  and Y.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;load the y position of the paddle in A.<br />;Load the X position of the paddle in Y.<br />;Then load the location of the first byte of the paddle you want to draw in X.<br />;JSR to this subroutine and it will draw the paddle.<br /><br />DrawPaddle:<br />  STA $0200,x;This works because before we jsr'd to DrawPaddle, we loaded the y position in A.<br /><br /><br />  STA temp1;We need to store it in temp RAM instead of keeping it in A<br />;For the subroutine. This is because you can't STY $0200,x. ST ,x is only available for A.<br /><br />  LDA #$37<br />  STA $0201,x<br /><br />  LDA #$00<br />  STA $0202,x<br /><br />  TYA;Move the value in Y&#40;the X position of the paddle&#41; into A.<br />  STA $0203,x <br />  inx<br />  inx<br />  inx<br />  inx;We want to work with a new sprite now, so we advance four bytes.<br /><br />  LDA temp1<br />  CLC<br />  ADC #$08<br />  STA temp1<br />  STA $0200,x<br />  <br />  LDA #$47<br />  STA $0201,x<br /><br />  LDA #$00<br />  STA $0202,xx<br /><br />  TYA<br />  STA $0203,x<br /><br />  inx<br />  inx<br />  inx<br />  inx<br />;*insert the same sort of thing for the final two sprites*<br />  rts<br /></div><br /><br />Then, you can use it like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">  lda paddle1y<br />  ldy paddle1x<br />  ldx #$04;The ball occupies $0200, $0201, $0202, and $0203, so we start with $0204.<br />  jsr DrawPaddle<br />;The first paddle's sprites are updated! You don't even have to update X to do more, since the DrawPaddle routine automatically moves it to the next free sprite.<br /><br />  lda paddle2y<br />  ldy paddle2x<br />  jsr DrawPaddle<br />;The second paddle's sprites are updated!<br /><br />;You can even draw more paddles in other locations!<br /><br />  lda #$80<br />  ldy #$80<br />  jsr DrawPaddle<br /></div><br /><br />If you use subroutines instead of hard coding everything it makes it very easy to add new objects to the game.<br /><br />One last thing. The CURSE of nesasm.<br /><br />Whenever you are using a zero page variable, put &lt; before it.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda temp1<br />;becomes<br />lda &lt;temp1<br /><br />lda paddle1y<br />;becomes<br />lda &lt;paddle1y<br /></div><br /><br />This makes your code faster. <br /><br />lda temp1 is like typing lda $XXXX which takes 4 cycles.<br />lda &lt;temp1 is like typing lda $XX which takes 3 cycles.<br /><br />It's faster, and there's no drawback to doing it 99% of the time. <br /><br />The one percent is when you want to do lda temp1,x. In that case lda &lt;temp1,x and lda temp1,x can possibly do different things.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Tue Jan 17, 2012 12:33 am</p><hr />

You should be able to check any number of collisions, even 1,000 if you wanted to.

It's possible the way it is written would make it work for one case and not another.

<div class="quotetitle">log in wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />So i would also have to get ballleft and ballright in the temp ram.<br /></div><br />Nope. You don't need to put the speed or direction of the ball in temp RAM, because your collision routine doesn't care about any of that. Your collision routine should only return whether or not there is a collision. There are exactly two possible outcomes (either the objects are colliding or they are not), so you can just use the carry flag for the result instead of more temp RAM. Set the carry within the routine if there is a collision. Clear it if there is not. Then simply use a branch after the subroutine to do what you want with the result.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;Collision check 1<br />lda ballx<br />sta temp1<br />lda paddlex<br />sta temp2<br />;etc<br />jsr Checkcollision<br />bcc skipbounceright<br />lda #$01<br />sta ballright<br />lda #$00<br />sta ballleft <br />skipbounceright:<br /></div><br />Having this part in the body of your actual subroutine:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda #$01<br />sta ballright<br />lda #$00<br />sta ballleft <br /></div><br />would mean that that subroutine could no longer be used to bounce the ball left. A similar problem to when you weren't using temp ram for paddle1x.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Where do i put the temp ram and HOW?<br /></div><br />You make room for it with .rs like any other RAM. You store and load values to it like any other RAM. Its purpose is only special to you because you have to keep its extent and what it currently needs to hold in mind, but temp and ballx are not different types of variables to the assembler.<br /><br />edit: <div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Because my paddles are the same in size i would not have to edit height and width.<br /></div><br />Correct, but keep in mind if you work this way the ball's y position must be stored in the slot of temp RAM that adds 8 for height, and the paddle's y position must be in the slot of temp RAM that adds 16. You're right that for pong it is not that worth it/useful to have temp RAM for height and width.<br /><br />Finally, a quick note about some code left over from the bunnyboy tutorial. The ball can't be traveling left and right at the same time or up and down at the same time, right? So you don't actually need four variables for the ball's direction (ballleft, ballright, ballup, balldown). You only need two. (balldirectionx and balldirectiony).<br /><br /><br />If balldirectionx is 0, the ball is traveling right. If it's nonzero, it's traveling left. Likewise for y. Less RAM, and serves the same purpose. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />2. It would have to be in programcode like this??<br />*snip*<br />and so on and on for other collision checs if there where any..<br /></div><br />That is correct.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Thu Jan 12, 2012 6:39 pm</p><hr />

There is a programming term "scope". Scope is a very important/difficult programming concept, so I hope my simple explanation is good enough.<br /><br />Each variable has a scope. A variable's scope is how long the variable is expected to refer to the same value. For example, how long ram location $00 is expected to contain ballx's position. <br /><br />A variable's scope begins when it is used the first time after it was not being used, and ends when it is free to be used for something else. <br /><br />Let's take a look at buttons1. Very early in each frame, you jsr to ReadController1. This starts storing which buttons are held in buttons1, and starts a scope where buttons1 is expected to hold which buttons are held.<br /><br />I could write whatever I want to buttons1 BEFORE the jsr to ReadController1 and it would not affect anything, because at that point buttons1 isn't expected to hold anything.<br /><br />The scope for buttons1 ends the last time it is expected to hold which buttons are held. So after you check for player 1 pressing up and down to move the paddle, the scope has ended. <br /><br />I could write whatever I want to buttons1 AFTER checking up and down for the first paddle's movement, because at that point buttons1 is no longer expected to hold which buttons are held.<br /><br />You cannot (safely) change a variable to an unrelated value while it is expected to hold a value, i.e. while it has scope. Imagine if we wrote something to buttons1 during its scope. It could possibly make the paddles move up and down without the user's input!<br /><br />buttons1 has a scope that is a little less than a frame. What about variables who have an "endless" scope? In your code right now, ballx has endless scope. After it is setup, it is always expected to have the same value. (The current value of the ball's x position.) Changing it to something unrelated would cause the ball to warp around!<br /><br />A temporary variable is a variable that has very short scope. Here is an example that adds 1/2 of a number to itself. It does this by storing itself in a temporary variable.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;Some number is in A. It doesn't matter what number specifically.<br />sta temp;A scope begins for temp here. It is expected to hold the number we want to add half to.<br />lsr a;A now holds half of itself.<br />clc<br />adc temp;We have just added temp &#40;our number&#41; to 1/2 of our number.<br />;We no longer need to know what temp &#40;our number&#41; was, because the operation is done. The scope for temp ends here.<br /></div><br />We could use then temp for something else (start a new scope) IMMEDIATELY after this.<br /><br />Now let's look at how this affects your collision detection routine:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">collisiondetection:<br />lda ballx<br />clc<br />adc #$08<br />cmp paddle1x<br />;etc<br />rts<br /></div><br />This routine currently compares two variables with near endless scope! <br /><br />If I wanted to use it to compare say... ballx and paddle2x. I would have to OVERWRITE paddle1x with paddle2x to use this routine. Overwriting a value in scope is BAD.<br /><br />To get around this, we use temp RAM.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">collisiondetection:<br />lda temp1x<br />clc<br />adc #$08<br />cmp temp2x<br />;etc<br />rts;Scope for temp1x and temp2x ends<br /></div><br /><br />To use this, you write the x values you want to check (like ballx and paddle1x) to temp1x and temp2x before the routine starts. This starts a scope where they're expected to be  those values. Then you jsr to the subroutine which checks them and ends their scope.<br /><br />To check two different objects, you write the values you want to check (like ballx and paddle2x), and jsr to the same subroutine. This allows you to use the same routine for all collision checks, without overwriting any variables in scope.<br /><br />The reason you want your collision routine as a subroutine is that, generally, you don't want to duplicate complicated bits of code.<br /><br />Imagine you had collision routine duplicated for each collision you wanted. (paddle1, ball and paddle2, ball). If you found a mistake in the collision code, you'd have to update two different routines to make the same change.<br /><br />edit: And the next day, I realize I'm describing a variable's "extent" not "scope"? At least I think...? Being self taught fills me with self doubt when I try to teach. I feel like I know how these things work but then call them the completely wrong things... Anyone else, please feel free to correct me.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Wed Jan 11, 2012 7:02 pm</p><hr />

Or you could look up "temp RAM" in an encyclopedia by its more common name of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_variable" class="postlink">local variables</a>. If that article is abracadabra, I'm willing to help explain it line by line.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Jan 11, 2012 8:14 am</p><hr />

Temp RAM is just a way to use a general subroutine.<br /><br />Ballx, bally, paddle1x and paddle2x etc. can't be used to store an unrelated number while the game is running because it will mess up the positions of those objects.<br /><br />Right now (I assume) your collision routine works by comparing ballx with paddlex directly. This means you can't use it to check ballx with paddle2x or any other two objects without overwriting the values stored in ballx and/or paddlex.<br /><br />If the routine used RAM values that weren't required to be consistent outside the routine, it could be used for testing any two objects and you wouldn't have to overwrite ballx, bally etc. or write multiple routines that do the same exact thing (like checking a collision) just with different ram locations (paddle2x instead of paddlex for instance).<br /><br />You would just write the values needed to the temp RAM before you jsr to the routine, and that one routine would check for a collision using the values in the temp RAM. If you want to compare two different objects, write the different object's positions to the temp RAM before the jsr to the subroutine and the same routine will tell you if they are colliding.<br /><br />Basically, temp RAM is RAM that is only used for a small part of the program and doesn't need to keep its values the same across multiple frames. The same RAM can be used for a lot of routines, because once the routine is finished the RAM's values have already been used and are "free" again.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Tue Jan 10, 2012 4:26 pm</p><hr />
