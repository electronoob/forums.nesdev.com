		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Psycopathic teen,
<br />
<br />it's really the other way around as tepples alluded to. The planes are defined by human vision.
<br />
<br />As for why you'd want YIQ, the point was to be backwards compatible with black and white television sets. The black and white TV would only pick up on the Y (intensity). Color TV's would pick up everything.
<br />
<br />Keep in mind that another reason that television engineers did not want to broadcast the raw RGB values (or rather, Green as luminance, G-R, and G-B) has to do with bandwidth and noise. The matrices "tilt" the primary color magnitudes more in favor of what the human visual system sees. The noticeable effect of bumping up and down, say 5 counts of Red out of a familiar 255 scale depends on what values of Red, Green, and Blue you're starting with. Sometimes it makes the color appear to shift, and sometimes it makes the intensity brighter or darker, or some variation of both.
<br />
<br />Y I Q and friends tries to make increases or decreases in value "more linear" or at least more consistently meaningful across the range. As in is it more purplish, or more greenish? on one axis, and is it more orangish or more bluish? on the other perpendicular axis.
<br />
<br />The bandwidth (or rather, maximally how much the value can change over a given period of time) of the I and Q signals can be much, much less than the luminance because the human visual system responds a lot more to lightness and darkness, than to shade of color. Again this was important to maximize the number of over-the-air television broadcast channels in the allotted FCC frequency range.

<br />
<br />The IQ plane I know is the same as the UV plane but rotated 33 degrees so I (warmness/coolness) gets higher "bandwidth" than Q (greeness/purpleness) but what makes that particular shade of orange/blue define how warm or cool of the color?  Why 33, and not 30?
<br />
<br />Another thing I can't figure out is, if .114 grey is supposed to be the same shade as blue, why does .114 grey look significantly darker on every computer screen I can find?  Is there something in the human brain that makes unsaturated colors look darker than saturated colors of the same luminance?

Did they originally plan to modulate the luma's amplification high during the +Q and -Q phase, and low during the +I and -I, due to the I signal being more likely to cause noticeable dot crawl than Q, because of it's larger bandwidth?  Did any television do what I just described?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Bandlimiting Q more means that sometimes (certain horizontal positions) more bandwidth can be recovered into Y, especially before comb filters were widely used. Thus it means that a medium-resolution Y content (3.6 - 0.6 ≅3MHz) or ~275 pixels per visible period can be represented by shifting it horizontally by a quarter of a colorburst cycle, or about 1/5th of a pixel.
<br />
<br />I'm not certain what you mean by <em>"Did they originally plan to modulate the luma's amplification high during the +Q and -Q phase, and low during the +I and -I, due to the I signal being more likely to cause noticeable dot crawl than Q, because of it's larger bandwidth?"</em> — it sounds like you're suggesting modulating some part of the Y signal at 7.2MHz? But the bandwidth for OTA transmission was limited to about 6MHz, so that's not it.

<br />
<br />I meant turning Y "on" during +Q and -Q phases and "off" during +I and -I phases, and low pass filtering it, so that high frequency orange-blue information doesn't leak into luma, while still keeping a high enough bandwidth for Y.

No, they didn't do that, that just destroys information.
<br />
<br />For proper OTA broadcast, the I and Q portions are bandlimited before modulation. Thus orange-blue information doesn't usually leak into luma with a matched receiver. Proper demodulation of Y includes subtracting the remodulated I and Q, and that's all that's necessary to take advantage of the narrower bandwidth of Q. But since we have clearly seen instances of both luma-&gt;chroma and chroma-&gt;luma crosstalk, the last important part is: The color subcarrier is chosen such that it's 180deg out of phase on every scanline and every field. So a light spot due to chroma-&gt;luma interference will be dark on the scanlines above and below and also the following field.
<br />
<br />Given the last bit, it is clear why one would think 2d or 3d demodulation of color would improve performance.
