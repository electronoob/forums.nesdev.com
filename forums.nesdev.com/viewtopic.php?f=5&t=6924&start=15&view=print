<br />Only a fool ignores the economics of something. <em>Everything</em> is a question of economics. Do you make an elaborate meal, or a simpler one that takes less time? Well, depends on what else you could be doing, how much more you enjoy the elaborate one, whether you'd have to buy more ingredients, etc. Or with coding, do you spend more time optimizing, or functionality? Depends on the costs of doing so, how valuable more functions are, etc. Economics is what entities with limited resources do, and us humans always have limited resources, no matter the situation, if only time.

It may not seem like you're making decisions based on costs and benefits, but you actually are all the time. Reading about cognitive biases is a good place to start. It can be pretty startling to go down this rabbit hole, so be warned.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Nobody is going to raise a multinational creating NES games.

<br />You seem to associate cost-benefit analysis to a narrow field of one's life. Doing so is limiting, because such analysis can benefit all areas. There's nothing cold and calculated about such things; acknowledging that it occurs all the time even if not done consciously is a step towards making it less cold and calculated, because it's in the open to be scrutinized, rather than working behind the scenes.

<br />Neither does a "modern console". How big is the hard drive? Is there one *cough*Xbox 360 Arcade*cough*? Even on an N64, is there an Expansion Pak? Does the player own a bunch of Controller Paks, or must we rely on a save chip on the Game Pak? Is your NES game running on a Famicom (with mapper sound) or an NES (without it)? Does the player own a Zapper, and is the TV a CRT?
<br />
<br />Like the consoles, PCs have <em>minimum</em> specs: the system requirements for the current version of Windows, or the specs of the iMac model sold three years ago. The Intel GMA is more than adequate for any sort of 2D graphics you want to throw at it, as well as 1999-class 3D graphics.

<br />
<br />Relationships can be about economics but its not that simple. Really its more about what you consider valuable, if you have others whos lives you consider to hold greater value than your own people will often allow themselves to suffer if it is to protect them or to give them what they want.

<br />That is really good to know. I used to play it as a rental, and will one day buy it again. And now I won't RAGE when I realize it doesn't work on my N64. I'll know why <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />
<br />Yeah, but still. Even if one more game gets made that would have never seen the light, it's worth it IMO.
<br />
<br />And yeah, maybe not enough resources, but still. A bunch of small 2D games and a couple 3D and even <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/blueprint-racer-4d/61-26174/all-images/52-321829/xboxboxart__8_/51-965737/" class="postlink">4D</a> games would be cool and very enjoyable. I love the XNA indie games Miner Dig Deep and I made a game with zombies in it. They're so fun! Wii quality for only $1!
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Also, 360 is the much better gaming system IMO, graphics are so much more killer, WAY better graphics unit.

<br />
<br />The issue with varied PC specs is mostly a question of how much you can stand limiting your audience, and how much you're willing to pay to provide tech support.
<br />
<br />Modern consoles have fixed specs for all the parts that actually matter, which'd be the controllers, CPU specs, system software, and GPU. Compatability issues on the PC are almost entirely a matter of GPU mismatches, graphics or sound driver issues, and order of magnitude differences in CPU/GPU capability between the top end and the onboard Intel IGP end.
