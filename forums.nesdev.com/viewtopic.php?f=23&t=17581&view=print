And 3 seconds shouldn't happen either (normally it should be around 0.5s).<br />The 10 seconds might have been because the old version didn't use DMA and such stuff (so loading a very large bootcode.dsi file from SD card may have been pretty slow).<br />And the remaining 3 seconds, that might include extra overload that occurs after loading+starting your bootcode.dsi file (ie. if it's loading further data after it got started).<br />I am normally using wifiboot.nds renamed to bootcode.dsi, and the &quot;WIFIBOOT&quot; message pops up &quot;almost instantly&quot;. The biggest bottleneck is uploading the wifi firmware (done upon coldboot by unlaunch, not by wifiboot), that takes around 400ms on older W015 wifi boards (with W024 boards it's much faster, and upon warmboot it takes only around 50ms to init the wifi hardware on either W015 and W024). The other bottleneck might be large files (bootcode could be up to 6.25MByte for DSi titles, and hardware transfer speed is about 8Mbyte/s for SD/MMC, so that could eat up almost one second... or longer if I've still screwed up something). And well, the final slowdown is that, I think, most people are currently using unlaunch to reload the patched/original firmware so loading speed would be about as slow as without unlaunch.<br /><br />DSi browser is working when booting it directly (eg. when loading it as bootcode.dsi and bootcode.prv files)? Then my code for wifi firmware uploading seems to be actually working (for initializing the new atheros hardware for commercial DSi titles).<br /><br />I haven't tested with flashcarts yet. I have a &quot;acekard2i&quot; somewhere. And I could test other flashcarts (of somebody donates one for testing). At the moment I could only guess that the problem might be related to uncommon chip id, or romctrl values, or missing support for 1000h-byte blocks, or requirements for additional delays.<br /><br />Speaking of ROM cartridges, the NDS-era carts are booting quite fast (less than 1s, about 0.3s or so), but I've been pretty shocked and scared when trying to boot DSi-era carts (using the official loading procedure it took up to 4s for cooking coach). Reasons are that newer carts are using cheaper/slower 1T-ROM chips (instead older/faster MROM), with unneccessary slow timings/delays declared in cart header (even for some MROM carts, that are accidently assigned to use slow 1T-ROM timings), lack of support for 1000h-byte block loading in firmware, doing switching cart-power off/on between loading nds and dsi areas, and simply more bloated code in newer cartridges.<br /><br />I've tweaked a bunch of things to get that newer carts booted at reasonable speed, it should be at least twice as fast as with original firmware. But maybe one of that tweaks is causing issues with flashcarts (though most of the tweaks should be probably working there, too, so I wouldn't want to remove <em>all</em> tweaks just for the reason that some of them might cause issues).<br /><br />Oh, and there are also some ROM carts that I don't know if they are working. Especially those with &quot;NAND&quot; memory, or with &quot;IR&quot; ports.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah booting directly as boot.nds from 4swordhax still doesn't work. I believe I tried that when trying to get around the unknown emmc error.<br /><br />Also 1.1 works now for my DSI XL. Tested the new cart loader. Blackscreens when trying to boot my Cyclo iEvolution flashcart if the cart is in TWL mode. Is able to boot my R4 but not my DS-Xtreme. (same issue, blackscreens).<br /><br />I tested Mario Kart DS booted from R4 from your new cart loader. Game hangs the moment I go the multiplayer menu. Seems like Wifi is incorrect state?<br /><br />It also fails the same way from my Acekard 2i so likely not an issue with the cart I used. Booted Mario 64 DS directly as well. It also hangs when trying to use the multiplayer menu.<br /><br />My Sonic Classic Collection cart is also bootable. It's a TWL cart too but can't tell if it's in TWL mode or not. It's hard to tell with that cart though but I guess it is? I don't really have any other TWL carts so wouldn't know. I assume you do detect if it's a TWL cart and boot it in TWL mode with the extended binaries loaded and everything.<br /><br />I think the DS-Xtreme might be failing to boot due to secure area check fail. I recall having to disable that check in NTR Launcher to get that cart to boot. But not sure if you're code is doing the same. There's no error handling with your cart handler. At least nothing it will display. Just blackscreens on the carts it failed to boot. DS-Xtreme is a bit wierd though. It's header loads arm9 binary from odd location in rom. At 0x100000 or so instead of the normal 0x4000. Even patched Launcher fails to boot it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />On that subject I hope you at least open source parts of your Unlaunch. Maybe the DSiWare and cart loading part can be open source? NTR Launcher I would love to add TWL cart support to. But the cart loading code it uses is ancient (uses same code from Nitrohax) and I don't understand the code well enough to fix it myself. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Oh one more thing. I noticed I was able to boot my Acekard 2i despite having ntrboothax installed to it. So it seems your card init code can trigger Acekard to use the first rom region instead of the retail rom region. So that's cool. ntrboothax users can still use Acekard 2i as a normal flashcart with Unlaunch if booted directly. NTR Launcher still causes it to try using retail rom region.

And if you take a copy of eMMC, does the eMMC image work in no$gba, or does it freeze there, too?<br />If not: Are you sure that you have the launcher installed? You need both .tmd and .app files for launcher (just mentioning because unlaunch v0.6 didn't write-protect both files, so data managment may have deleted the .app file) (also .app and .tmd must be for the same firmware version, and matching your console region; just in case you tried to replace the file(s) by a different version?).

You need both .tmd and .app files for launcher (just mentioning because unlaunch v0.6 didn't write-protect both files, so data managment may have deleted the .app file) (also .app and .tmd must be for the same firmware version, and matching your console region; just in case you tried to replace the file(s) by a different version?).</div><br />i tried running 2 backups, one with unlaunch 0.8 and the other with unlaunch 1.1, the result is the same as on the ds, the one with 0.8 boots fine, the one with 1.1 doesn't

I tried doing the install several times but it did not work, robz8 said it may be a &quot;phantom install&quot; but im not 100% sure. So now i have tried installing the newest version 1.1 and im still getting the &quot;phantom install&quot; issue, everything says it installed correctly but its still showing that im using 0.8.

And I should be really more careful when adding new patches (but there are none planned at the moment anyways).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">robzombie91 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'm getting a wierd bug installing the newer versions of unlaunch.

Weird, sounds as if the eMMC writes are completely ignored, but I wouldn't know how/why that could happen. Or do you have the V0.8 installer on your SD card (renamed as bootcode.dsi)? Then it would reboot that file, asking you if you want to install V0.8.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Apache Thunder wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I tested Mario Kart DS booted from R4 from your new cart loader. Game hangs the moment I go the multiplayer menu. Seems like Wifi is incorrect state? ...  Booted Mario 64 DS directly as well. It also hangs when trying to use the multiplayer menu.<br /><br />I think the DS-Xtreme might be failing to boot due to secure area check fail. I recall having to disable that check in NTR Launcher to get that cart to boot. But not sure if you're code is doing the same. There's no error handling with your cart handler. At least nothing it will display. Just blackscreens on the carts it failed to boot. DS-Xtreme is a bit wierd though. It's header loads arm9 binary from odd location in rom. At 0x100000 or so instead of the normal 0x4000.</div><br />Don't know why the Mario games hang on multiplayer. I've tried Metroid demo cart multiplayer, that looks right (it doesn't hang, but I've no second cart for actually testing multiple players in there).<br />Didn't knew that there are carts with ARM9 code elsewhere than 4000h. If it's at 8000h or higher then the special 16Kbyte area is left unused, and the encryption for first 2Kbyte is also omitted (at least it's so on NDS, a DSi would probably refuse such carts completely).<br />I think that I've already implemented that case properly... except that I am still issuing dummy read commands for the special 16Kbyte area... maybe the flashcart doesn't support that commands at all and gets confused when receiving them - I can try to omit them on carts with ARM9 at 8000h or higher in next version.

What I would like to know if the wifiboot exist for something like the ds lite?  I have a few of them amassing dust at home since the kids don't use them (and mostly destroyed them.. kids, you know <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />) and the flash card I had mostly died in the first years I received it as a gift so I don't have much way to write anything for them anymore. <br /><br />I didn't search on the subject yet since I'm not working on any related project but this thread got me interested to know more about it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok noticing a minor graphics issue when booting a cart via the cart loader. Best I just show it. I noticed this when my R4 boots up via the cart though that cart clears it out by the time WoodR4 is done booting. But this cart doesn't really recover. Yeah the Max Media Dock cart doesn't do much of anything on a DSI, but it was another cart I had so thought I'd test it with Unlaunch. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Don't think I've seen this occur with retail games, but it's abnormal since I don't see this when booting them normally so it might present unexpected issues with some carts perhaps?
