<br />
<br />In the first case you'll have to add a wire in your adapter and add a resistor in your NES (possibly a capacity too). In the second case you'll have to add a few resistors and capacities on the board (there is already slots for all of them), and a wire in your NES (don't even need to open it if you use the expansion connector I guess, but I haven't done that so I don't know how well this will work).

<br />
<br />For the sound, just add resistors and capacities where the board have slots for (it even says the values), but the audio pin used is EXP 6 (pin 54) which is probably not the same as the power pak or Famicom-&gt;NES adapters so you'll have to add one more wire anyway.
<br />
<br />Or just use Just Breed japanese as a donnor cart. Altough with a FC-&gt;NES adapter the cart is longer than supposed so it gets out of the NES, and you have to use a pencil to block it as low as possible (that worked great for me at least).

<br />
<br />That's what I was asking was about the donor carts.  Thanks for the info.  Just took a look at my Castlevania III cart. (us version) and noticed a pin on the backside of the cart in the middle I believe it's pin 54 Question is...why put a sound pin on a cart that the pin will never be used unless you mod the system in the first place? So basically all i have to do is ad a wire and resistor from exp 6 to cart port 54 and my just breed repro will have extended sound.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Castlevania III can't be a donnor for Just Breed because it has no SRAM. You need one of the Koei games (any will do, because JB needs 8kb of SRAM, but any game with 16 or 32kb will work fine as well, JB doesn't relies on the SRAM to be mirrored or something evil like that).
<br />
<br />It's great that the power pak uses the same pin as MMC5 carts, tough the output resistor is already in the MMC5 board. If you added it on the exp port already you'd probably just want to place a wire above the slot for a resistor, else both will be in series and the total resistor will be too high ? I might be completely wrong here I don't really know.
