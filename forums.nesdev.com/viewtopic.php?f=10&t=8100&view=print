<br />
<br />The best emulator for your needs probably depends on what you want to do with an accurate emulator. Are you trying to develop NES software without access to a PowerPak or other rewritable cartridge?

I love <a href="http://nesworld.com/homebrew/multicart.zip" class="postlink">Mottzilla's 11-in-1</a>multigame loader but I am experiencing game freezes on position #4 in the loader in nestopia (the software is not perfect, as the author informed me...). I was thinking about making a cartridge of it, but since it won't work in an emulator, it's probably not worth the trouble...

<br />You sure? Cybernoid relies on bus conflicts when switching the music on, but works properly in Nestopia.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />All I know is that CNROM games select the wrong banks if the value at ROM doesn't match the value that's written.  I can see it in Mario Vs Airman and my Lolicatgirls demo.
<br />
<br />FCUEX ANDS the two values (written value, and value at ROM) together.  Nestopia and Nintendulator don't seem to do that.
<br />
<br />Edit: I tested out Cybernoid.  When played in Nestopia, music is on by default.  When played in FCEUX, music is off by default, but can be turned on by pressing A when the game is paused, and graphics look correct afterwards.  When testing in Nintendulator, music is off by default, and after turning on music, graphics are screwed up.  From that, I think Nintendulator does not try to emulate bus conflicts.

<br />The only reason this is correct is that MOS N channel transistors used to ground digital outputs have generally better saturation characteristics than MOS P channel transistors used to short the output to +5V.
<br />In other words, when conflicting transistors (one from the 2A0x and one from the cart's ROM) are saturated, this becomes a short circuit on the supply line in theory, but when considering the imperfection of the transistors, you'd say it's two resistors in series, and the resistance of the "low" transistor will be much lower than the resistance of the "high" transistor (and hopefully both resistances in series are not low enough to cause too much problems to the power supply), therefore the line is at a voltage closer to 0V than +5V and is considered by the 74HCxxx on the cart to be logical '0'.
<br />
<br />I would never rely on that 'AND' logic to be the correct implementation of a bus confilct... If the EPROM has higher impedence outputs, it could happen that the CPU always "win" the battle, or on the other side if you place an EPROM with lower impedence it could either "win" the battle against the CPU or cause the power supply to fail and the NES to reset itself.
<br />It's not a surprise the transistor driving the line low typically "wins" the battle, but nobody should rely on this.

<br />The 2A03 is NMOS technology, which mean logical one is driven by depletion-mode N-channel FETs used as constant current source. If the 2A03 outputs a logical one and the ROM (or something else) shorts it to ground, then you can always expect that the result is logical zero. The reverse is not necessarily true, though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I recommend using Nestopia, Nintendulator, and FCEUXD.
<br />
<br />With Nestopia you get really accurate results. But when there's a problem in your program, there's really nothing you can do with Nestopia to figure out where the problem lies. It has pretty much no debugging features from what I've seen. Nintendulator is also very accurate, and has okay debugging features. The interface with those features is a little sluggish to try and work with.
<br />
<br />FCEUXD isn't terribly accurate, but for general debugging, it's the best. I love all of its features. For most of my testing I just use FCEUXD, but if I'm doing something really timing sensitive, I will test it in both Nestopia and Nintendulator. The ultimate test is the actual hardware, which sometimes does display bugs that I don't find on any emulator (issues with sprites and disabling rendering, specifically). For this reason, I would recommend also investing in a PowerPak (the NES developer's ultimate weapon).
