I grabbed a PCI-E parallel port card for my desktop yesterday with a mind to get my CopyNES working again.<br /><br />I've tried CopyNESW but it fails to install the hwinterface.sys driver (&quot;Failed to start parallel port I/O driver!&quot;).  Running in admin mode or WinXP compatibility mode didn't help.<br /><br />I found the USB CopyNES and USB CopyNesBlue programs, but are there any more recent versions made for the old-school parallel port version?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Michael

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So far, I've been able to get CopyNESW partially up and running by swapping out the I/O code from hwinterface.sys to inpout32.dll, which supports both 32 or 64 bit systems and has a signed driver to install (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.highrez.co.uk/downloads/inpout32/default.htm">http://www.highrez.co.uk/downloads/inpout32/default.htm</a><!-- m -->).<br /><br />However, it's timing out trying to send the version request.  The CopyNES is detecting the PC, and is not booting the game when the cable is connected, but they're not talking to each other.<br /><br />It's not using ECP at the moment, I haven't modified the code to support ECP regs at an address other than Base+0x400 yet (the PCI-E card is at D000..D007 and D010..D017, because why should they put it where LPT1 has always been).<br /><br />Blah, doesn't look like I'm going to get it working tonight.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Michael

I pulled my parallel CopyNES out of the closet and attempted to get it to work. First i tried it on Two different Windows XP laptops and couldn't get it to work so I tried putting a windows 98 image on an old IBM Thinkpad R31 laptop. For starters, the FTD2xx.dll that comes with CopyNESW doesn't work and gives the following error:<br /><br />The FTD2XX.DLL is linked to missing export SETUPAPI.DLL:CM_Get_Device_ID_ExA<br /><br />and refuses to start. I replaced the FTD2XX.DLL file that came with CopyNESW (197kb) with one from this archive <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX/Win98/D30104.zip">http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX/Win98/D30104.zip</a><!-- m -->   This was 80 kb in size. <br /><br />After replacing the file, I was able to get into the CopyNES program. However most of the options were grayed out. I tried selecting LPT1 and it set BASE to 378 and ECP to 400. What do these two options do and what do I need to set them at? I looked at the properties of my Parallel port in hardware manager and it is set to Input/Output range 0378-037F and interrupt request 05.<br /><br />In the bios I can enable/disable the parallel port, Set it to output only, bi-directional, EPP or ECP. I couldn't get it to do anything being set to ECP, but when I set it to bi-directional and set CopyNESW to LPT1 with BASE 378 and ECP E800, the program thinks I have a version 1 CopyNES (which I do, mine came from the first batch Kevin produced). When I attempt to send a game to my Power Pack Lite I get  'WriteCommand: timeout on data transfer!'  and  'CopyNESW: An error occurred during the previous operation' errors.  If I try to use the NESDUMP3.BAS file with Qbasic instead of CopyNESW I can select RAM Cart, then 5 for my Power Pack Lite and the type in the name of the file I wish to load. Then it says RESETTING LOADING PLUGIN and then hangs and nothing happens.<br /><br />I tried using a couple of different cables, but only the one appears to do anything, the other two get no response from COPYNESW at all. I'm gettting tired of dealing with this, if anybody has any ideas on what the issue might be I would appreaciate it. Thanks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, I finally got it working on Windows XP. Quietust updated CopyNESW as that appeared to be part of the problem. The release note for the latest version is quoted below.<br /><br />&gt;Another minor update, this one actually loads plugin data from disk correctly and thus should actually work again.<br /><br />I also bought a brand new 3' parallel cable. So between the two I can now use my copynes with an HP Compaq nx5000 laptop with Win XP. I still can't get it to work with Win98, but since I have it working in Windows XP now it doesnt really matter.
