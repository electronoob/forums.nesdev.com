I see no reason to write anything other than the NT index on the first write though, since everything else gets overwritten. Is your purpose to show that bits do get overwritten?</div>
<br />The purpose is to document things that cause confusion.  The existing documentation referred to Drag's forum post which confused myself and another person to no end.  The existing documentation and the forum posts are, simply put, not clear enough to someone who has little familiarity with the nature of how this works; it's good to have reference source material, but it's even better to thoroughly document things.
<br />
<br />Seeing which bits get overwritten is equally as important too, though I'm not trying to cover every example case (e.g. 2005/2005/2006/2006, 2005/2006/2005/2006, 2006/2005/2005/2006, 2006/2005/2006/2005, etc...), just ones which are known to be commonly seen in people's code or commercial games.
<br />
<br />This is the kind of stuff that really needs thorough and concise documentation, since I think PPU behaviour on writes to $2005/2006 has been a long-standing sore spot for anyone coding for the NES who isn't ancient ( :-) ), wasn't involved in the discovery, or is working on an emulator.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Back in the day, the main thing that confused me was $2006. It <em>looks</em> like you can just write the address of some tile within the nametable, and it'll start drawing from there. However, that's not true, because it won't start from the top of the tile unless you subtract #$2000 from what you write, and this confused me for the longest time, until I had something explained to me
<br />
<br />The PPU doesn't have an "address" register. Instead, it has various counters: X, Y, y, and N. X and Y are 5-bit counters, and hold the (X, Y) coordinates for the current tile being drawn. N is a 2-bit counter that determines which of the 4 nametables that tile is coming from. "y" is a 3-bit counter that determines which scanline of the tile's pattern we're drawing (Don't forget, the PPU draws the same row of tiles for 8 scanlines, the only thing that changes is the specific byte of the pattern data it draws)
<br />
<br />When you line those counters up like this: NNYYYYYXXXXX, you conveniently get the byte address for the nametable tile that those counters are pointing to. This is what's happening when you write to $2006, you're giving an "address", and the PPU is translating it to an (X, Y) coordinate within one of the nametables (N) by stuffing the bits of your "address" into those counters as appropriate.
<br />
<br />The tricky part is the fact that the PPU needs 2 additional bits, so it knows whether you're trying to access the pattern tables, the nametables, or the palette. Those 2 additional bits come from "y".
<br />
<br />So, when you write to $2006, this is what's happening:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bit&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0<br />$2006 &#91;........ ........&#93;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|||||| ||||||||<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|||||| |||+++++--- X<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|||||| |||<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;||||++-+++-------- Y<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;||||<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;||++-------------- N<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;||<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;++---------------- y<br />&#40;Note: The highest two bits of $2006 are ignored&#41;<br /></div>
<br />This is why you can't simply write the address for a nametable tile when you want the screen to start drawing from there; the nametables are at $2xxx, so you're setting "y" to 2, which means you'll start 2 pixels down from the top of the tile you want to draw, instead of at the top. If you subtract #$2000 from the tile address you want, then even though the "address" you write points to the pattern tables, the actual <em>counters</em> are set up properly (especially "y", which is now set to 0), and the tile will correctly be drawn from its top scanline.
<br />
<br />The PPU can line these counters up in a variety of different ways. For example, $2005 does it like this:
<br />YYYYYyyy XXXXXxxx
<br />which translates to a specific pixel within a nametable, but you cannot select which nametable you want by using $2005.
<br />
<br />While the PPU is rendering, it uses something like this:
<br />NYYYYYyyy NXXXXX
<br />Every 8 pixels, 1 is added to X, which overflows to the low bit of N (so it'll cross to the next nametable, horizontally). On the next scanline, NXXXXX is reset, and 1 is added to y (moving us to the next scanline), which overflows to Y (moving us to the next row of tiles), which overflows to the high bit of N (crossing us over into the next nametable, vertically).
<br />
<br />Additionally, there's some extra logic in place to make it so Y overflows (and wraps) after 29, instead of after 31. However, Y only overflows into the top bit of N when overflowing from 29. Otherwise, Y will just wrap from 31 to 0. This is what creates the "negative scrolling" quirk when you set the Y scrolling between E0-FF; Y is being set to 30 or 31, and after 31, it wraps to 0 without touching N.
<br />
<br />This was awfully wordy to explain, but hopefully it wasn't too confusing. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> When you write to $2006, you're <em>setting counters</em>, even though it <em>looks</em> like you're writing an address. That's why the $2006/2005/2005/2006 trick requires you to write a bunch of bullshit to $2006; even though they're not addresses, they're still setting the counters the way you want them.

<br />You realize the two documents are almost completely identical, right?
<br />
<br />Here they are side by side.  I stripped off the email headers and put SKINNY.TXT and SKINNYNT.TXT in the same doc:

<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/pRkXb.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />So I don't see how you consider his old doc terrible and the new one brain-dead easy.  It's more likely that your own knowledge grew and made it easier for you to understand over time.

The wiki version follows a convention very close to that of the new version. Other polish changes made in the wiki version include splitting <em>t</em> and <em>v</em> at byte boundaries, the identification of what bits get copied at "scanline start" as all horizontal bits, use of $ on all hexadecimal addresses, and capital letters at the start of sentences.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For a much simpler 2006/2005/2005/2006 trick explanation (since my previous wall-of-text may be intimidating):
<br /><ul><li>Calculate a temporary value TEMP:<br /><ul><li>Take your Y scroll value, ASL twice, AND #$E0, and store it to TEMP.</li><li>Take your X scroll value, LSR three times, ORA with TEMP, and store it again.</li></ul></li><li>Select the nametable you want to display from (ASL'd twice), and write it to $2006.</li><li>Write your <strong>Y</strong> scroll value to $2005</li><li><em>&lt;wait for h-blank to start...&gt;</em></li><li>Write your <strong>X</strong> scroll value to $2005</li><li>Take your TEMP value and write it to $2006.</li></ul>
<br />Those last two writes need to occur in h-blank, which is why it's important to calculate that TEMP value beforehand, and <em>not</em> in between the last two writes. (Calculating this value may be a good way to wait for h-blank though!)
<br />
<br />If you don't care about <em>why</em> this method works, you can simply use this method as-is, and it should work. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />If $2006 confuses you, keep in mind, you <em>only</em> write addresses to $2006 when you want to read/write $2007 afterwards. If you're just playing with the scrolling, the value you write to $2006 is <em>not</em> going to be an address.
<br />
<br />If the backwards $2005 writes confuse you:
<br />$2005 and $2006 are 16-bit registers; you need to write to them twice. However, they <em>share</em> the <em>same</em> latch that determines whether you're writing to the upper 8 bits, or the lower 8 bits. So, you're writing a high byte to $2006, but rather than writing a low byte to $2006, you're writing one to $2005 instead. And then the reverse happens, you write a high byte to $2005, and then you write a low byte to $2006.

Or you might get shaking when the writes are applied before the critical time in one line and after in the next.
<br />
<br />The hblank time is short, but not too short. The portion of the scanline when the NES isn't rendering or fetching the background is dots 256 to 319. On NTSC, this is (319-256)/3 = 21 cycles long, and a typical sprite 0 spin wait has an uncertainty of 7 cycles. A DMC IRQ wait might have a few more cycles of uncertainty. Drag's pseudocode translates to the following code, which works with up to 15 cycles of uncertainty:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; lda last_PPUCTRL<br />&nbsp; asl a<br />&nbsp; asl a<br />&nbsp; sta PPUADDR<br />&nbsp; lda camera_y_lo<br />&nbsp; sta PPUSCROLL<br />&nbsp; asl a<br />&nbsp; asl a<br />&nbsp; and #$E0<br />&nbsp; sta temp<br />&nbsp; ldx camera_x_lo<br />&nbsp; txa<br />&nbsp; lsr a<br />&nbsp; lsr a<br />&nbsp; lsr a<br />&nbsp; ora temp<br />&nbsp; ; hblank needs to start before the LAST cycle of the next instruction<br />&nbsp; stx PPUSCROLL<br />&nbsp; sta PPUADDR<br /></div>
<br />It isn't too different from <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=64111#64111" class="postlink">tokumaru's code</a>, except tokumaru cleverly overlaps camera_x_lo with temp to save one byte of RAM at the cost of three cycles and two bytes of ROM.
<br />
<br />Dwedit: What do you mean? The version on the wiki uses EDCBA for affected bits and . for unaffected bits.

<br />At least for me things became MUCH easier to understand that way.
<br />
<br />As long as you keep writing coherent things to $2005/6 (that is the name table adress you write to $2006 correspond exactly to the scroll position you write with $2005) then there should be no glitches, and the order in which you write the registers does only matter for fine scrolling. Any order should do as long as you end by a final $2006/2 write.
