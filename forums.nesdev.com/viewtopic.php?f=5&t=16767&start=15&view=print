And...I do have Intel Rapid Storage Technology! I haven't spotted Link Power Management. Do you know what it does? I'm probably not going to bother now that Firefox is working so well for me, but I'm curious.

Oh well...Firefox is enough of a solution for me, but I'll keep this in mind if I run into a similar problem elsewhere...for all I know it is still happening and that is why it takes a while for Dropbox to really fire up as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I typically use Firefox, mainly because I like to have NoScript enabled when going to random sites. I'm sure there's an alternative to the Firefox/NoScript combo, I just haven't bothered to look it up. Otherwise, I will really only use Safari/IE/Chrome for testing my website to make sure there aren't any Javascript errors that Firefox doesn't catch. For instance, in Firefox, if you draw a part of an image onto a canvas, and you go outside of the bounds of the source image, Firefox doesn't really care and just moves on. In Safari (and I think Chrome), it actually generates an error and doesn't move past that line. So yeah, it's fun to make sure the site works in all browsers.<br /><br />Otherwise, I probably wouldn't care enough to choose to use another browser. In Chrome, I hate the idea that I'm signed into Google all the time (and therefore, tracked). I don't think I should have to go &quot;incognito&quot; to not be tracked. I also just feel like if I'm signed into Google when doing searches, it's going to screw with my search results, because it wants to bring up results relevant to what I've searched for in the past. Not sure if that's just paranoia, but I figure I'm just better of staying signed out of Google in Firefox, and performing searches that way.<br /><br />Not sure how much I like the new interface of Firefox... Probably will just take some getting used to.
