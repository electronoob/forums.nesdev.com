		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi guys,<br /><br />I got experienced with SNES hardware and creating micro-controller circuits around them. I have questions regarding Current. <br /><br />So God only knows that my current setup is &quot;healthy&quot; for my MCU.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />I want to learn more about everything electronically here.<br /><br />I don't know where to begin, I landed somewhere in the middle of digital electronics. I feel lucky to have my SNES Flasher working. Because I have no idea how the 'current' aspect is working. <br /><br />I'm guessing from a  glance at my chip's datasheet (ATmega8515) the i/o lines only send out a small amount of mA. Why mA? I guess that makes SNES cartridge happy enough, although I don't know why. (Why SNES Cartridge happy with some mA)? Is it cause those lines only use Voltage for logic? <br /><br />I haven't checked that the Input Power to my circuit (USB) has a certain current either? So far I don't even know what it's pumping out. For my specific app, I am using FTDI and I'm pretty sure FT_PROG sets the current output to some hundred mA. However, I am venturing away from FTDI to native USB, so I need to know the correct steps to calculate with current for my new designs. How do I watch over it, make sure adding new parts to my circuits doesn't break anything regarding current? Does connecting components in parallel not affect current? Series? I can answer some of these questions on my own. Please acknowledge the broader .<br /><br />How does one know what the current should be on the circuit as a whole, how it should be on i/o lines etc.<br /><br />I am also asking this question in light of that fact that I am planning on throwing a 8x flip flop on 8 digital i/o lines. I dont know the correct output current the chip should have. Most output some form of some mA and I suppose once again, that everything is based on voltage and as long as the current is some small mA that it won't hurt/help anything. Am I right?  I am connecting in parallel, intuition tells me that won't be a negative addition to the circuit. My level of electronics knowledge needs to get UP'd here. <br /><br />Any help is so totally welcome.<br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br />Bazzinator

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Only read the first part...but imagine, water in a pipe. The SNES uses so much water (The current). Voltage is basically, the pipe being sucked on by a vacuum to bring it through the pipe. Resistance...well, not good with this example, but imagine it like a sponge in the pipe, it just makes it harder for the water to go through. But current is basically the &quot;flow&quot; that really allows logic levels to switch, to detect highs and lows, etc. it's mA because it's being measured in thousandths of Amps, as 1 amp is a lot of water (electron) flow. I hope you're familiar with Kilo, Mega, Giga, and then the inverses, Milli, Micro, Nano, Pico, etc. I hope that helps some.<br /><br />ETA: Also, you usually what are called &quot;CLR's&quot; or Current Limiting Resistors. Basically, you use the CLR on the output to control how much current the chip allows to flow through it to the device, weather it be an LED, another chip, etc.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />or for instance, looking at a flip flop IC, advertised as &quot;Low Input Current of 1 Î¼A Max&quot; That sounds TOO low for my circuit, correct? However the datasheet gets misleading for me, I am disregarding this. Moving on to some chip with higher input current rating, correct?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I found some answers: <br /><br />&quot;A--Connect any device up to it's correctly-specified voltage, and it will draw just as much current as it should draw.  A 5V IC generally will draw much less current than a 5V relay--both are 5V, but each has a different current draw. Current draw is a function of the device itself.<br /><br />Raise the voltage above the spec'ed values, and that voltage drives more current through the device--often frying it.<br /><br />If your power supply has the current capacity to supply all your IC's, then you can safely connect them all to it. They will not draw more current then they need. Only if the voltage is too high will it force more current flow.&quot;

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Best to just google. I'm in an AAS class for Electronics, so I'm getting to some of thoe, but understand most.<br /><br />Sinking current is taking it from somewhere, sourcing it is basically giving it out. If a device is connected to an IC, like an LED, it sinks current, from the source, the IC.<br /><br />Some other stuff is just talking about mA numbers for I/O range, sinks and sources. Some seem to be about fluctuation in temperature.<br /><br />Lastly, how much current is needed depends on the devices used. Just add them all up. An NES in whole takes up about 350 mA of current, more with more complex mappers. An LED takes 15mA of current to run alone. Other IC's will take some of the voltage/current to run on, too. It just all adds up, it's not too bad.
