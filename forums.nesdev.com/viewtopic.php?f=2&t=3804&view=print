<br />
<br />I'm assuming this means I have too much code or something...  But I thought I had a lot more space than what I have...  A whole bunch of the nes rom has 0's in it...
<br />
<br />One "fix" I've attempted:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.bank 0<br />.org $C000</div>
<br />
<br />That is basically above my constants section, which I have at the bottom of my code.  Basically messages, palette defines, etc.  Though that doesn't seem to work.  Is there something I need to do when trying to reference that area?

<br />
<br />I also got rid of that .org $C000 as that makes it compile and not work.  Heh.
<br />
<br />So...  Could it be that I have way too many .db's in there?  I have quite a few messages I write to the player and use the .db to simplify the tasks.  I'd be kind of amazed if I had too many instructions as the SMB1 disasm has like 4X the code my program does.

If you have a section that is too big (for example if bank 0 had 10KB) then you can skip the next bank declaration (bank 1) and it should automatically overflow into there.  I know that works for data, assume it works for code.  Be sure to change your ines header to 2x 16KB prg too.

So if you're working on a larger project that doesn't use 8K banks, another assembler would be appropriate.

I know I've done my fair share of it, I will not deny that. I at least offered <em>a little</em> bit of an explanation why I don't prefer it. But bashing it every time it's mentioned is uncalled for. Saying you shouldn't use it because someone doesn't like it (or because it "sucks donkey balls") just is completely useless and uninformative.<br /><br />And useless posts are getting rather annoying.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">NotTheCommonDose wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I AM ERROR! lol <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /></div>

<br />
<br />I took an assembly class last semester and we used MASM in there, so a lot of assembly-related concepts are similar here.
<br />
<br />But anyway, as I had said, the issue's been resolved by using my second bank that spans from $E000-$FFF9.  I didn't know about it until talking to bunnyboy.

<br />
<br />Except as discussed in <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=3726" class="postlink">another topic</a>, the only significant reason NESASM is not good is no temporary labels.  Everyone claims it sucks, but have no technical reasons.  WLA-DX and CA65 may be more common but using them would not have solved this problem.  It likely would have created more problems related to code layout earlier, since setting those tends to be more tricky without examples.

<br />
<br />That was only an example of rewording a crude post, not actually what I wanted to let the person using NESASM know. I wasn't trying to establish that someone should switch assemblers, I was trying to establish that saying something "sucks donkey balls" is uncalled for, and that that person should've approached saying what they were trying to say in a more proffesional manner.
