		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I guess it feels as odd because there isn't really a SNES counterpart to this site (so the better question would be: why not do that then?). But admittedly the biggest problem is that burying it inside another subforum will make it harder to reach when compared to the systems that don't have such a subsubforum.<br /><br />EDIT: by the way, if we're going to talk about reorganization: shouldn't the homebrew subforum be placed higher? It strikes me as odd that it's the <em>fifth</em> link when the whole point of this site is to encourage making NES homebrew.

But then even the newbie section should be higher, and NESemdev lower... I don't know.

I'd imagine most regular users are using &quot;view unread posts&quot;, but the different categories seem like it'd be more approachable to new users, because there's a lot there.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&quot;View unread posts&quot; is a link that's rather easy to forget about and I bet a lot of people are only interested on what's going on in a few subforums. Dunno what other people do, but I imagine that the most common thing is to actually check which threads in the subforums you care about have the unread icon. In this sense, subsubforums are actually quite annoying.

There's no way to tell if the new posts belong to one of the subsubforums until you go into the subforum (or skip straight into the subsubforum and hope you guessed right). In either case it means an extra barrier that didn't use to be there earlier. I assume that this wouldn't be anywhere as bad if the subsubforums links still showed whether they have something new or not from the index.

Not surprising, considering I'm very focused on NESdev'ing, and the demoted forums are the ones that don't have much to do with that.
