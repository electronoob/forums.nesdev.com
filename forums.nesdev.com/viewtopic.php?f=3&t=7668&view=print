		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am curious about this MMC1_A12.nes test ROM.  In the source code it clearly states I [my emulator] should have a problem:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">-&nbsp; &nbsp;bit $2002<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bvs -<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp;bit $2002&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;Wait for sprite zero hit<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bvc -<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$1f<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2001&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;Turn on grayscale mode<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ldx Delay<br />_delayLoop<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp;lda $6000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;cmp #TestConst&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;Wait until PRG RAM is disabled &#40;emulators will freeze here&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;beq -<br /></div>
<br />
<br />I don't get stuck where it says "emulators will freeze here".  However, I *do* get stuck on the bit/bvc a few lines above it.  I pass all sprite test ROMs.  I can see in my debuggers that sprite 0 is entering the multiplexer but it's never selected by the multiplexer [as the highest priority] and it's never rendered, thus it never "hits".  I can see sprite 0 is an 8x8 block of "color 0 of palette 3F1C".  SO, I'm confused as to how this sprite is supposed to be hit?  Perhaps there's a sprite hit case that isn't tested by blargg's sprite hit test ROMs?

<br />I'm pretty sure this is the problem.
<br />Sprite Zero is always the higher priority sprite so it's always selected. The sprite zero hits happens whenever a non-transparent sprite zero pixels collides with a non-transparent background pixel (except in column 255, where it does never happen I think).
<br />
<br />It does NOT matter if sprite zero is on or between the background, it just matter both collides.
<br />
<br />In fact I'm surprised you say my demo is the only thing that breaks in your emulator. I'd bet many games used behind-background sprite zero for their hits.

<br />I suppose that "grayscale mode" <em>should</em> be considerated a non-transparent background. That.

<br />
<br />It's not getting to the point where it turns grayscale mode on.
<br />
<br />I believe tepples is correct and that it is a problem with...well...hmm...I just checked and it is using CHR-RAM.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://img263.imageshack.us/img263/507/mmc1a12.png" class="postlink">Here's</a> a screenshot of the debugger views at the breakpoint when sprite 0 starts entering the multiplexer (top, left pixel of it).
<br />
<br />As you can see sprite 0 is pointing to tile 0F and the sprite patterns are 8x8 and from the right ($1000) CHR bank.  So, if I got my maths correct that means sprite 0 should be drawn from pattern data starting at $10F0.  As you can see in the CHR-RAM hex view (and also in the graphical view at the bottom but less obvious), $10F0 is 00 for 16 bytes.  So that explains why my sprite hit isn't hitting...all of the sprite pixels are transparent.  
<br />
<br />As I mentioned, I pass *all* of the sprite hit and sprite overflow tests.
<br />
<br />So there seems to be something wrong with how CHR-RAM is being filled?  I would be tempted to believe I have a CPU core problem if I didn't also pass 167 out of 179 test ROMs, including all CPU instruction operation and CPU instruction timing tests.
<br />
<br />I'm open to other ideas...I guess I'll step through the loop where CHR-RAM is populated next.

<br />
<br />I see the LoadAlphabet loop loading both sides of the CHR-RAM but then there's a mapper write and the right side disappears.  Looks like a problem in my MMC1 implementation.  Woot.
