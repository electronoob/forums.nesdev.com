<br />I agree here, at least until you need to submit a .rar file to a repository that takes only .rar files, not .7z files.
<br />
<br />What do you recommend instead of Adobe Flash CS series for making web animations in SWF, SVG+JS, or Canvas+JS format?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For the archiving the windows version of 7zip is a great replacement for winRAR. Does all the major formats plus it does not thave the nag screen(I know it can be removed but that can be quite hardd for some if they don't feel like dishing the money out). For GNU/Linux I use pz7zip-full(I think that is what its called and fileroller(plus the unfree unrar for passworded rars).

<br />Good question. I used Flash mostly for applications rather than animations, so FlashDevelop was a good substitute. I have even made some simple scripted animations with it, but for longer movies it would be a pain in the ass. I also haven't used JavaScript for complex web animations (I just occasionally move a few things around).
