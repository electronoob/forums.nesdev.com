		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />^^I know that home made games use them, but no official games do, right?  (EDIT:  I totally missed the part where you said commercial games do...  I didn't know that.)  I'm just starting out with official mapper 0 games like Super Mario Bros 1.  I'll implement unofficial opcodes once my emulator is actually up and running.  Is Super Mario Bros 1 an alright ROM to start with?  My CPU runs the title screen just fine as far as I can tell.  I know enough OpenGL, so I can create a window and get the PPU working with just the title screen first.  At least, that's what I was planning on doing.  Here's what I think my next steps are...<br /><br />- Start a PPU class with registers<br />- Create memory callbacks from 2000 to 3FFF to emulate mirroring, and redirect reads/writes to PPU registers<br />- Create PPU memory class (inherits from my generic memory class)<br />- Create memory callbacks for PPU class for mirroring<br />- Start working on the PPU<br /><br />So far, I have very little knowledge of how the PPU works.  I've only been focusing on the CPU so far.  I'll go back to reading once I get to that point.  Hopefully I can get something to display on the screen soon.  I only started working on this 6 days ago, so I think I'm making good progress  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Oh, and one question...  For each CPU cycle, the PPU and APU cycle 3 times, right?

I've been looking, and I've been unable to find a simple description of what the PPU actually does each cycle.  That gave me a better idea than any of the things I've read so far.

I know about pattern tables and tiles and nametables.  But I don't understand where the nametables come from.  I'm guessing the cpu passes them to the ppu through 2000-2007?  If that's right, how does the ppu read them into it's memory?  All the information I can find discusses patters, tiles, nametables, sprites, palettes, etc.  But I can't find anything that actually says &quot;This is how the ppu works...

I usually have about 20 browser tabs open at a time, where most of them are the wiki!  The problem was, there's SO much information that it makes it very difficult to just find the basics to get things started.  If I'm looking for basic information, I have to read through tons of advanced stuff that just ends up confusing me.  I don't mean to complain about the wiki at all.  Its great.  It was just a little overwhelming for someone who doesn't know any of this stuff.<br /><br />I was having a really hard time understanding the PPU basics.  But Ulfalizer and jero32 at #nesdev explained a lot of the basics to me.  I was able to get my PPU registers and vlbank working enough so the games will start writing nametable data to the registers.  I should be okay for a while.  Now that I have something to build off of, I can hopefully get things to work.  I was just clueless about where to start, and I needed some clarification.<br /><br />I'm glad everyone here and at #nesdev is so helpful.  I would have still been stuck on my CPU if you guys weren't here to explain things to me.  If I get my emulator up and running, I'd like to write a really in-depth explanation of how to write one and where to start, in hopes that it would help out noobs like me  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, for people who don't know much about this stuff, it would be nice if there was a place that gave you a simple outline of what you need to implement to get you started and then you can worry about the details on your own.  At least that's the way I learn, but everybody learns differently.  I couldn't read through the wiki pages and discern the difference between minute details and important features.  That's why I'd like to write a really detailed explanation for other newcomers when my emulator's working.<br /><br />But they explained how the 2006-2007 registers work, and how the vblank flag works, and that's all I needed to get started.  My games started writing to the registers after that, so I could start on my rendering code.  Currently my PPU manages to get the correct nametable and pattern addresses, get the current tile number, read the pattern bytes, and come up with color index for each pixel of the background, not including attribute color because I'm not sure how that works yet.  Next, I'm adding the color palette and a gui.  I'm usually pretty good at figuring this stuff out once I get started.  It's getting started that's the hard part haha.  But hopefully I'll get some pixels on the screen tonight!  Do you think I should use OpenGL or SDL?  I know how to do this kind of thing easily in OpenGL, but I heard SDL handles input and audio as well, but I've never used it.<br /><br />Edit:  I decided to try out SDL.  I gotta say, I'm liking it.  It's very easy to use.  It's kind of a pain to use OpenGL for this kind of thing.  I would have had to create a texture and display it on a quad.  With SDL, it's a lot easier and only a few lines.
