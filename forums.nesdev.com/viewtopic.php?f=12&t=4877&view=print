		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello there!
<br />
<br />Glad to have found this forum, where there are so many well-known retrogaming hardware experts around! Having some SNES software and hardware experience myself (translation, ASM, console &amp; cart modding), this is the place I've been looking for. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Well, let's head on to business. I recently ventured building a 32 Mbit SNES cart using one 16 bit 27C322 EPROM. I used <a href="http://nintendoallstars.w.interia.pl/romlab/27c322_8.htm" class="postlink">Siudym's untested schematics</a>.
<br />
<br />Here's what the completed thing looks like:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://img510.imageshack.us/my.php?image=27c322tosnespl8.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://img510.imageshack.us/img510/8163/27c322tosnespl8.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />
<br />I know it's butt-ugly, but hey, it's my very first beta HiROM 27C322 SNES cartridge. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />And unfortunately, it does <strong>not</strong> work. All I get is a black screen once that baby is powered up.
<br />
<br />I tried to e-mail Siudym for a solution, but he didn't reply. Then I asked d4s for help - thanks again, dude! - but to no avail. Even with his suggestions, I wasn't able to get this thing to work.
<br />
<br />Here's what I've tried so far:
<br />- the original schematics (Siudym)
<br />- connecting the SNES bus's A0 to pin 2 of the 139 and A1-A21 to A0-A20 of the EPROM respectively in order to avoid having to byte-swap the ROM in any way (d4s)
<br />- not making the EPROM &amp; SNES /OE connection (d4s)
<br />- using HC microchips instead of LS ones to make sure the ROM data gets on to the SNES bus fast enough (d4s)
<br />
<br />Nothing works. I even tested it on d4s' Ultra16, which has a memory viewer. The banks C0-FF (which should contain the ROM data since it is a HiROM game) remain empty, just like when no cartridge is inserted at all. Also, I checked the voltages on the 139, the two 245s and on the EPROM itself to make sure I didn't forget to make all the power connections. All VCC pins are at +5V as they should, and VSS is at GND.
<br />
<br />Now, does perhaps someone of this forum have any idea what could be wrong? Any help would be greatly appreciated as I really want to finally get this project to work. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Thanks in advance!
<br />orwannon

<br /><span style="font-size: 75%; line-height: normal">N.B.Please don't bother suggesting alternatives like using 27C801 EPROMs (I have successfully built carts using these), a copier (I indeed own one), or a Tototek flashcart (I'm going to buy one anyway). In this thread, let's just talk about connecting 16 bit EPROMs to the SNES bus. Savvy? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></span>

<br /><img src="http://www.jcomcp.plus.com/16to8bit.PNG" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />This circuit replaces the transceivers in the design you are using with 3 state transparent octal latches (74xx373).  In this schematic the 373s have their latch inputs tied high (transparent mode).  The OE/ of the 373s are connected to the nand gates (1 74xx00 quad 2 input nand gate) which decode the upper/lower byte from the A0 and CE/ lines.  I can't see why this wouldn't work but it is wholly untested. ^_^

If that were OK, you could then just use two 74257 3-state multiplexers and drop a chip. 257s are also cheaper than 373s and come in a 16 pin package instead of 20.
<br />

<br />Edit: note typo that the 27322 doesn't have a A21.. so wire SNES A1-21 to 27322 A0-20.
<br />
<br />If you're using 74HC parts, I'd probably ground the ROM's /CE to not float the inputs though this will consume more power.

<br />
<br />P.S. Thanks kyuusaku. I finished the proof of concept for the 96mbit game (95 mbit technically) with a working prototype. I didn't quite use your design but it put me in the right direction.

<br /><div class="quotetitle">shadowkn55 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">There might be some bus conflicts.</div>
<br />
<br />So, do you mean /ROMSEL should be connected to the EPROM's /CE directly (and only), and /RD to the 257s' /OE only (while leaving the EPROM's /OE pin at GND as shown on kyuusaku's design)? Also, when using HC parts and thus grounding the EPROM's /CE pin, should I leave /ROMSEL unconnected? (/ROMSEL = SNES's /CE, right?)
<br />
<br />BTW, as the SRAM on my PCB got erased during the tests, I presume an SRAM conflict in Siudym's schematics could be the reason for the ROM data not coming through ... This is just an assumption though.
<br />
<br />Anyway, thanks for your help! I might put kyuusaku's design to the test shortly. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />If anybody else should know how to get this done with transceivers as shown on Siudym's schematics, I'd appreciate it (especially because I won't need to buy new parts! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />). His design can't be too wrong because the 16 bit adapter for the Willem EPROM programmer uses two 245s as well ...

You need it so only when both /CE and /OE are asserted the buffers output. If you only decode with /CE, then if a game writes to ROM there will be a conflict, /RD OR /CE protects against this.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">orwannon wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">BTW, as the SRAM on my PCB got erased during the tests, I presume an SRAM conflict in Siudym's schematics could be the reason for the ROM data not coming through ...

This has nothing to do with the design, just how you are not using the proper ROM select from the on board decoder (74139 or MAD-1 etc).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">orwannon wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If anybody else should know how to get this done with transceivers as shown on Siudym's schematics, I'd appreciate it (especially because I won't need to buy new parts! :P).

<br />Using 245s will "work" but it's not the most elegant way due to logical/electrical glitches. Unrelated but this is NOT a good way of bidirectionally accessing 16-bit memory, the only reason the Willem gets away with it with only two 245 is because EPROM can be programmed as small as a bit at a time due to their construction, this would not work for other 16-bit memories that need a complete word latched.
<br />
<br />This is how you would build a working 245 version though:
<br /><a href="http://img11.imageshack.us/my.php?image=245.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/9701/245.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />Siudym's conflicts for the same reason I outlined above, mine WILL work as the 139 also implements /CE OR /RD.

<br />
<br />As your version is not very different from Siudym's design, I just had to alter the /CE and /OE connections accordingly. For the record, I tied pin 1 of the 139 to pin 4 of the MAD-1. Works like a charm! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Thanks a lot! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />
<br />
<br />I feel like trying out your "more elegant" design with two 257s next. I guess that when there's SRAM on the cart, I should use the on-board decoder's ROM select instead of /ROMSEL for one of the OR gate's inputs, just like I did now, correct? One last question on this would be whether you'd recommend any microchip type concerning the OR gate? Looking at the 139's <a href="http://www.datasheetcatalog.org/datasheet/philips/74HC_HCT139_CNV_2.pdf" class="postlink">datasheet</a> because you mentioned its OR implementation, I guess I could simply use that one (e.g. pins 1 and 3 as the inputs and pin 4 as the output) ...?
<br />
<br />Anyway, big thanks again for your efforts and great technical help! I couldn't have done it without you! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />The 139 is a decoder, it doesn't really have an OR function, I just chose the outputs which gave an OR condition, and further decoded that with A0 to chose which buffer to enable/two birds with one stone.

<br />Don't ground the 139's pin 3, but instead wire that to pin 24 of the MASK ROM (note that you have to use a PCB with a 36-pin MASK ROM - not only for correct pin numbering). And pin 1 of the 139 should be wired to pin 4 of the MAD-1 (if applicable) or to MASK ROM pin 33.
<br />
<br />This works great for me. BTW, kyuusaku's "257 version" works just as well - and is a bit easier to construct. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
