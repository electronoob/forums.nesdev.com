<br />
<br />But as soon as I get another, I'm going to test this out. I'm anxious to see the results, as I also have a test ROM of a polygonal rendering engine that uses MMC3 + WRAM that didn't work previously, as it uses 5k of WRAM. Thanks so much for the fixes!

It's interesting that thefox didn't have the same problem with his MMC3 mapper, I wonder why.<br /><br />MMC3: improve IRQ timing<br />MMC3: add "open bus" read for 4016/4017 (fix Dirty Harry control problem)<br />VRC6: added mapper 26 (Esper Dream 2, Madara)<br />N106: IRQ bugs fixed<br /><br /><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~olimar/NES/" class="postlink">http://home.comcast.net/~olimar/NES/</a><br /><br />If anyone has other requests, now would be a good time to ask them, while I'm in the mood <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>
<br />
<br />I just got a PowerPak for Christmas and the main mapper I was sad to see not working was the alternate VRC6 used in ED2 and Madara.  I was surprised it hadn't been written because CVIII worked so well and I thought this varient was not a large change.  So, I decided to see if I could request that it be worked on, and low and behold it had already been done!  Thanks loopy! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> 
<br />
<br />Well, I just tried the AG translation of ED2 and it seems to work perfectly.
<br />
<br />But, when I tried the japanese version of Madara it had serious graphical glitches, wrong tiles shown in seeminly random places, starting with the title screen and wierd music from the intro onward.
<br />
<br />Has anyone else seen these same issues with Madara?
<br />
<br />And just in case you are still in the mood, a few less pressing requests:
<br />
<br />1) All of our completed translations at DvD Translations work great on the Power Pak except surprisingly, Valkyrie no B≈çken: Toki no Kagi Densetsu.  It is unplayable from the point where you start to walk around.  I checked and it has the same problem with the original rom too so it isn't an artifact of the translation.
<br />
<br />2) We're currently working on a translation of a two disk FDS game.  It would be neat to see it work on a real NES, going somewhere past the title screen, but I'm sure getting an FDS game with more than two sides to work will be a challenge to figure out how the user will pick the proper side.  I guess an automatic way for the NES to do it that might work is you could have it just try every side in order until it doesn't get a load error?  I've done extensive work disassembling the FDS BIOS so I would help on this one if I can.
<br />
<br />3) Lastly, we are working on a game called Pocket Zaurus who's mapper, 152, hasn't been implmented yet.  No biggie.

<br />Or go into the back. There usually is a small section of drawers that contain basic electronic components.
<br />
<br />Kind of a pity how the store is mostly cell phones and junk now, rather than electronic parts. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />Edit: Also, I found a bug in the PowerPak's interface.
<br />
<br />If you have a battery-backed game that you played, the next time you turn on your PowerPak, if you hit start (to access the last game you played), it won't load the SRAM. Instead, you have to go to the file browser and load the game from there.
<br />
<br />I'm using the default PowerPak mappers/firmware along with Loopy's updates.

<br />
<br />heh, you beat me to it joe. Thank you for the attention given loopy.
<br />
<br />EDIT: with the password for stage 3-2 you don't get to the buggy stage directly. You have to play through the first part of the stage (which is normal) to get there.
