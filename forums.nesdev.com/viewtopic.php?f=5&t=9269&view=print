It must be stellar?  <br /><br />From my limited exposure to C# and people trying to do &quot;complicated&quot; (if you call message packing/unpacking complicated) things with it, I'd say the answer is probably &quot;no&quot; or &quot;with a lot of sweat and tears, maybe&quot;.<br /><br />Good luck!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Microsoft royally screwed up with WPF.  It's slow and unresponsive.  They also made it look ugly as hell in Visual Studio.  If all you knew about WPF came entirely from Visual Studio's designer, you'd never know it was capable of looking decent, unless you somehow knew about the separate style designer programs.  Not good advertising for something that you need to convince developers to switch to.  If you were able to make decent looking UIs from within Visual Studio, it might have taken off.

Of course, as far as emulators go, C++ is probably the best choice, so why were you considering C#? For the GUI toolkit? Or just because you wanted to write an emu in C#? <br /><br />Like Dwedit pointed out, it can probably be managed with WPF, but why not go with WinForms? It gets you a lot closer to Win32 than WPF. How important is an elaborate UI framework in an emu? <br /><br />It's your choice of course, I just don't follow the reasoning.

Now that would be interesting to see. 1 FPY? (Frame Per Year)<br /><br />But my primary concern was/is having no message loop.
