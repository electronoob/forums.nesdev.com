For you it sounds like you'd need luck to get LDA, LDX, etc... Unless you can choose (at least partially) your plate number.<br /><br />It seems in Germany after the region code there is 1 or 2 letters, then a number. So you could use 2 letters and do publicity for a particular NES game (if they allow you to choose the number, I have no idea if they do). For example : NES-VN to make publicity for Castlevania III or NES-XR to make publicity for Mega Man 2. That'd be very cool. Also I bet some people in this region does publicity for NES game without even knowing it. If someone ever got to this place it'd be nice to share.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Shades of a Wii hacker's STRNCMP?</div><br />strncmp() is a standard C function, nothing much to do with the Wii or any other system.<br />It's strange there is number plate with only letters. Here in Switzerland it's the opposite, it's only numbers (except the region code 2 letters). Pretty boring.<br />I could get '6502' but unfortunately they ask 2000 Swiss francs if you want a number below 10k (they are normally reserved for trucks and taxis).

Wii system software 3.3 switched to the correct <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">memcmp</tt> for discs, and 3.4 switched for all executables.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It's strange there is number plate with only letters.</div><br />In USA most states offer completely personalized &quot;vanity plates&quot; at a modest additional price.

It's easy to display messages, and that's not the role of an immatriculation place. I prefer greffing subliminal messages on existing systems <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />In my canton (swiss equivalent of an US sate) you can choose any free number between 10000 and 599999 for a little extra, but as I said if you want between 1 and 9999 you'll have to pay a huge extra which is really ridiculous.<br /><br />Cantons are free to assign numbers as they want, so in other cantons it might be different. The closest I could do in Switzerland is move to Neuchatêl and have a number which start in 5, so that it looks like an S. For example I could have NE 56502. Unfortunately the spacing ruints it all <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

And yeah, it used all NES-style instruments.  I later re-did it in Nerdtracker, not that it was anything special to listen to.  Also one of my early NES projects, Roadkill, later on I had rewritten big parts of it and added music, on the date 6-5-02 (yeah it's US date format, but still).

Completely innocuous, looks exactly like the plates around here, but is pretty important when you're talking about the NES.<br /><br />On the subject of vanity plates, you can choose 7 alphanumeric characters, and add one space or hyphen (because it's half the width of a character). In addition, most states have a selection of background pictures/designs you can choose from, and each state has their own overall style and &quot;default&quot; plate, and they're all unique, so it's always clear where someone's from. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
