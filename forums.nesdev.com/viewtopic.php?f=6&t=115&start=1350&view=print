<br />And remember, Gil, I'm still committed to donating $5-10 for your hard work. I updated my list a little bit too, with composer information, and more specific names like for Challenge of the Dragon (since there's two versions, one by Sachen and one by Color Dreams).

<br />
<br />I've requested 10 games for his next work, but I can't currently enjoy them as NSF's... I think he's doing hacks/translations like several months ago, and that I had to wait 5 months for another NSF update since July.

<br />The only ones I'd like to have are Zheng Jiu Shi Ji, Zhen Jia Hou Wang and Ling Jie Hu Fa (from the pack I sent him about one month ago). I'll use them for my future GameMaker projects. But I can't donate because I'm under 18.
<br />
<br />BTW, if you can learn 6502 for your NSF resurrection project, I'll send you a pack with some unripped MMC3 games.

There are some Color Dreams games which I have the source code to and they aren't ripped (Operation Secret Storm, Challenge of the Dragon, and Happy Camper). I already know where the instrument data is, but I don't know how to rip an NSF. Gil-Galad did do a video showing how it's done on YouTube.

Not sure why you like the music like me lol
<br />And I know what game you're talking about, the one developed/published by Mindscape, the Motor Massacre rip-off. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
