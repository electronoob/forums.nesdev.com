You shouldn't run the PPU ahead of the CPU, because the CPU can change PPU operation at any time... whereas all the influence the PPU/APU has on the CPU can be predicted, so you can safely run the CPU far ahead first.
<br />
<br />My emu checks for sprite 0 hit during pixel rendering (in the multiplexer), and then changes my 2002 status variable.  Then I catch up the CPU on every $2002 read.  (yeah it's not super efficient since wait-for-sprite-0-hit loops will have the PPU catching up every other instruction, but it works and is simple)

<br />You only need to catch up the PPU on $2002 reads during those scanlines where $2002 is likely to change, such as those that contain sprite 0 and thosethat contain &gt;= 8 sprites.
<br />
<br />EDIT: corrected

<br />
<br />You'd only need to catch up when any one of the following is true:
<br />
<br />1)  PPU is before start of vblank + CPU is past start of vblank
<br />2)  PPU is before end of vblank + CPU is past end of vblank
<br />3)  Sprite 0 flag is clear + CPU is on on/after a spr0 scanline + PPU is on/before a spr0 scanline + BG and spr rendering are both enabled
<br />
<br />
<br />Then of course there's stuff for the 8-sprite flag... which I think is why I keep putting off this method of prediction.  It's such a pain to track every scanline where the 8-sprite flag could raise and do checks like the above.

<br />You could calculate the next scanline to contain at least 8 sprites whenever $2001 is written to with the sprites turned on, and then you could mark those scanlines for catch-up on $2002 reads.

<br />Heh, same issue I've had, though my approach is just to not implement it. If a game is polling it, you need to run the PPU every time since that 8th sprite might have just rendered. I don't think you can tally up the "sprites per scanline" at the beginning of the frame since sprite RAM can be modified mid-frame (correct?). Hmmm well I suppose you <em>could</em> do this ahead of time and only run the PPU on scanlines which have more than 8 sprites, and recalculate this if sprite RAM is modified mid-frame. Quite complex.
<br />
<br />So far I've only found Bee 52 to need the flag, so I hard-coded its time to scanline 21+164.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Your post suddenly made it seem much simpler tepples!
<br />
<br />You only need to track the first scanline where 9+ sprites are found.  You can sort through sprites when the PPU is flipped on ($2001) and when sprite data is changed ($4014, $2004).  You don't even have to catch up the PPU... you can just keep a timestamp when the 8-sprite flag will raise.
<br />
<br />I just might have to impliment this now.  No more procrastinating ;D

<br />
<br />But the basic idea I've got working is:
<br />
<br />- Catch up the PPU on $2002 reads
<br />- Set the Sprite 0 flag in your PPU emulator as you render pixels
<br />
<br />If sprite 0 flag isn't raising, then it could be you're not catching up as far as you need to be (or even at all?)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i could get working sprite hit (althougth blargg's test still throw me errors).
<br />but now im having problems in mmc3 games.
<br />What im doing is the following:
<br />
<br />- on cycle 259 (0 - 340) i clock the irq counter if the conditions for clocking it are true.
<br />- i runppu() when a chr swap is done.
<br />
<br />maybe im setting/clearing at a bad moment 2002.7 flag.
<br />i do the following:
<br />
<br />- i set 2002.7 (and generate a NMI if enabled) at the end of the frame.
<br />- im clearing it at cycle 0 of scanline = - 1 just after vblank pass.
<br />
<br />it seems that this of setting 2002.7 is not bad when i runcpu() after (((262 * 341) / 3) * 15) master cycles (a frame). 
<br />When runcpu() returns from the frame i catch up again the ppu (runppu(cpu_timestamp)) and dont know what to do with my ppu_timestamp var (i normaly substract it from my cpu_timestamp var), i dont know if its well said in english i mean: ppu_timestamp -= cpu_timestamp.

<br />
<br />subtract a frame's worth of cycles from all timestamps.
<br />
<br />I have something like the following:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">s32 framecycles = 262 * 341 * PPU_CYCBASE;&nbsp; // master cycles in a frame<br /><br />RunCPU&#40;framecycles&#41;;<br />RunPPU&#40;framecycles&#41;;<br />RunAPU&#40;framecycles&#41;;<br /><br />cpu_timestamp -= framecycles;<br />ppu_timestamp -= framecycles;<br />apu_timestamp -= framecycles;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />do not reset any timestamps to zero, since then you lose "spillover" cycles.  Cycles that went into the next frame should take away from the next frame's time.
<br />
<br />
<br />As for your MMC3 problems, I can't really help ya.  Double check your MMC3 IRQ emulation (was it working with your old method?)

<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">void ClockIRQCounter&#40;void&#41;<br />&#123;<br /><br />if &#40;g_MMC3.cIRQ == 0&#41; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;g_MMC3.cIRQ = g_MMC3.cReloadValue; //reload IRQ counter with reload value <br />else <br />&#123; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;g_MMC3.cIRQ--; // decrement IRQ counter <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;if &#40;&#40;g_MMC3.cIRQ == 0&#41; &amp;&amp; &#40;g_MMC3.IRQFlag&#41;&#41;//IRQ counter just became 0 and if MMC3 IRQs are enabled, raise 'IRQ pending' flag <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;//g_lpCpuContext-&gt;IRQ_pending = TRUE;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;a6502IRQSignal&#40;&#41;;<br />&#125; <br /><br />&#125;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />strange that its not working ah?
<br />The thing i have a question when IRQ counter just become "0", what is better to directly execute the IRQ or to set a flag and then when cpu emu back to the main execute engine check the IRQ flag and raise it?
<br />Well i hope this can help you to help me.
<br />Thanks!
