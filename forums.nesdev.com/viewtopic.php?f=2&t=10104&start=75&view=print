I find the main thing isn't NES quirks today, but mapper quirks like indirect indexed write on MMC1 and just crap like that.</div><br />I can think of a way for this quirk to affect severely homebrew though: have a sprite 0 that's just one pixel high, and have it happen right in the scanline that's glitched. If missing the sprite 0 hit happens the game to misbehave completely (especially if it has long term effects), now suddenly the game will crash randomly on real hardware without seemingly any explanation whatsoever, and will be a debugging nightmare. With emulators at least you can catch it earlier (no need to deploy new builds to the cartridge all the time and hope the power cycle is right).

If your game is writing to $2000 after VBL, it's going to be at a fairly consistent place. It may vary by say 100 cycles, with one of them being the bad dot. Since it's due to the 9th bit of X scroll being 1, there's a 1 in 2 chance there. With normal rendering the write can only occur at the bad spot every other frame, so 1 in 2 chance. This totals 1 in 400 chance each frame. When the game powers up on the bad alignment (which is pretty much certain after playing on a few days), and the game running millions of frames over weeks of play, it's bound to happen thousands of times.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I also saw this in Zelda 2 a couple years ago, and was wondering what the hell was going on.  IIRC it was even right at the beginning (in the temple where Zelda sleeps).  It would be a little interesting to hear if people notice this in other games now.<br /><br />But I guess this is a good reason to be careful about mid-frame $2000 writes just the same as $2001.  If one needs to disable recursive NMIs, it's usually better do it it in software.  In practice, disabling NMI hardware I'd expect would freeze the music/sfx for that frame.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;inc nmi_recursive_depth<br />&nbsp;pha<br />&nbsp;; play music, check the state of nmi_recursive_depth, possibly skip all other processing<br />&nbsp;pla<br />&nbsp;dec nmi_recursive_depth<br />&nbsp;rti<br /></div><br /><br />Another time $2000 often is written mid-frame is when changing BG tiles after a sprite zero hit or timed wait.  But obviously this should be happening on a known position.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think it should be emulated, personally, though I won't flame those who disagree. I do have one question, the answer of which may nudge some opinions towards or away from it - does anyone here with more experience on the NES think that this glitch could be harnessed and made useful for some sort of demo effect? I love seeing things done with hardware that can't normally be done, such as the entirety of the modern C64 demoscene <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />If it can be harnessed and &quot;tamed&quot;, then it should be emulated, full stop. Perhaps if nothing else, in today's time where no emulator does emulate it, it could be used as a cheap way to programmatically determine whether one is on an emulator or not? Or is there another, better way to do so? I'm not talking about for &quot;anti-emu&quot; code that stops a ROM from running, but perhaps someone might want to make a demo with some slight differences in text or graphics depending on whether it's an emulator or hardware.

At best it can only be used every 3 scanlines, because it depends on the write to $2000 happening at a very precise PPU phase. At worst, it can't be used at all. And an equivalent effect should be possible with timed writes to $2006 on two successive scanlines.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What struck me about this is that the &quot;glitch&quot; spans no more than one scanline.<br /><br />The images posted by LocalH show the full double-240 (interlaced) scanlines.<br />Shrunken by a factor of 1.25, 384p for 480i — a quarter of the image interpolated out.<br />(Add compression loss; the footage presented is not 100% reliable.)<br />Calculated, lines 171-172 of the &quot;frame 12657&quot; PNG = a scanline bet. 106-107.<br /><br />Seeing that this line has a fixed horizontal scroll, I used FCEUX to look at the name table for similarities— nothing out of the ordinary; just two sections of the map.  So I looked at the execution range during this part of World 1-2.<br /><br />The cart (using the PAL version) uses vertical mirroring, and only sets the x-scroll (for the scoreboard).<br />The NMI routine, with no interrupt pins held low, quickly sets the x-scroll to zero (from $80A6 on, with a double-STA$2005 subroutine), and continues well past the Sprite-0 hit code (where the x-scroll is reset to the game scroll).  After Spr-0 hit, you have updates, $73F and $740 are piped directly to $2005 at scanline 30.<br /><br />The NMI routine ends here at scanline 91, but I've seen it go up to 114, which fits with the PNG image.  This would also mean, depending on game processing, inconsistencies in the vertical offset of the &quot;glitch&quot; line— appears to be the case.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;LDA $2002&nbsp; &nbsp;A:04 X:05 P:A4 Y:04 L: 91 -- clears status reg bit #7<br />&nbsp;PLA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:51 X:05 P:24 -- pushed from an earlier routine<br />&nbsp;ORA #$80&nbsp; &nbsp; A:11 X:05 P:24 -- hold NMI enable bit on<br />&nbsp;STA $2000&nbsp; &nbsp;A:91 X:05 P:A4 -- forces PPU register changes<br />&nbsp;RTI&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:91 X:05 P:A4<br />&nbsp;JMP *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;P:A5</div><br /><br />If it were to occur after the JMP loop started, _only_ a PPU NMI could do that<br />- not easy to be some stray NMI signal, as the code would be updating parts of the game 50/100% more often/faster.  I've not seen that in the videos.  If the NMI is delayed with overwhelming processing, the game skips, with the scoreboard scroll not zeroed, sound not updated (producing sfx artifacts).  <a href="http://geocities.ws/daedheadap9/gameinfo/smbovw.zip" class="postlink">This occurs easily in SMB</a>.<br /><br />I reject the possibility of these frames being merely due to loose pin contacts, because one bad bit would mean more than one bad scanline (and easily 8 lines consecutive).  No single binary digit would result in a glitch at a scanline 107 (or actual equivalent with the NT daisy chain address).<br /><br />It's been figured that this is due to the $2000 write, performed mid-scanline, forcing an update of PPU registers, registers in a pipeline that are only fully fixed on the next line; the PT-NT pipeline tracking is a little flakey/lossy here.  (Power-on synchronizes it.)  Every three lines reflect the CPU's 3/3.2 per pixel cyc. to the indivisible 341 per line (it takes three lines to come to the same pixel offset without a forced interrupt, as seen in full_nes_palette).  It's a sudden change of pipeline flow right at the point of a calculation phase, where the low-level read address is calculated.<br /><br />Super Mario Bros. is a bit cheap to carry a one-size-fits-all routine to execute things normally only executed before gameplay.  This &quot;glitch&quot; should also occur in other games that write $2000 mid-scanline like this.<br /><br />On emulating this, I would expect Nestopia, which has a very close PT-NT pipeline, to bring out the every-3-lines effect of ppu_2000_glitch.nes, but it doesn't.  It shouldn't be hard to make the code change there.

I got home, removed the non-working hack, and after much cleaning I got it booting Super Mario Brothers. Having played plenty of SMB on both Game Boy Color (Mario DX) as well as in emulators, the glitchy line stood out to me right away, as I wondered whether this NES was on its last legs. Years later I would get a Famicom and see the same bug.

Looking in Visual 2C02, the only extraordinary thing that would happen in that situation is that you would have a direct logic path from the first data bus line (line 0, since $2000:0 is the relevant bit) to bit 10 of loopy v (both the <strong>write_2000_vramaddr</strong> signal and the <strong>copy_vramaddr_hscroll</strong> signal would be high, connecting <strong>_io_db0</strong> to <strong>vramaddr_t10</strong> to <strong>vramaddr_v10</strong>).<br /><br />Not sure how that could cause the value to disappear though, since the data bus line should still have the &quot;right&quot; value. Maybe there's some analog thing going on, or maybe it has something to do with M2 out from the CPU having a &gt;50% duty cycle, while the actual write only happens during the &quot;true&quot; last 50% (the PPU &quot;sees&quot; the write while M2 is high).<br /><br />Edit: It works exactly the same for updates to loopy t via $2005 and $2006 by the way. The &quot;connect data bus to relevant t bits&quot; signal in all cases is <em>M2 &amp;&amp; address == $200x</em>, where x is 0, 5, or 6, and the &quot;connect horizontal bits of t to v&quot; signal is triggered at the end of the scanline.
