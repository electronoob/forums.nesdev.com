<content type="html" xml:base="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=10844&amp;p=123215#p123215"><![CDATA[
Hi,<br /><br />I happened to read the handwritten notes I made when figuring out the Cheetahmen II board back in 1999, and compared with the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES_Mapper_228" class="postlink">mapper 228 info on the nesdev wiki</a>. The wiki page mentions &quot;It is claimed that there are four 4-bit RAM locations at $4020-$4023, mirrored throughout $4020-$5FFF.&quot;<br /><br />Does anyone know where that claim originated? It's definitely not true for the Cheetahmen II board I examined, and it's almost certainly not true for Action 52 either. (I say <em>almost</em> because I don't have the notes I made about the Action 52 board layout handy. But there's nothing on the Action 52 board which could implement that. And the Action 52 board schematic shown <a href="http://furrtek.free.fr/?a=cheetahmen" class="postlink">here</a> confirms that.)<br /><br />Anyway. A couple of notes if anyone wants to add this info to the wiki entry...<br /><br />On the Cheetahmen II cart I examined (PCB 023-N509 REV 0) the PRG ROM can't be disabled (unlike with Action 52). However on the board there was a cut trace. Had that trace not been cut, it would lead to the /CE pin of the PRG ROM. Would Cheetahmen II fail/crash on an emulator which always implements PRG ROM selection in its mapper 228 code?<br /><br />Also, though of course no game uses it, I think the most likely use for the latched A4 address value would have been as the high CHR bit. E.g. if a board contained two 4Mbit CHR ROMs, the latched A4 could have selected which CHR ROM chip to use.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=316">mark_k</a> — Fri Jan 03, 2014 1:27 pm</p><hr />
