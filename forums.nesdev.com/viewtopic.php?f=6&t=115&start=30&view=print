<br /><strong><span style="color: red">EDIT:</span> The previous Rollergames fix I uploaded had incorrect initial bank data, so one of the samples wasn't being played correctly. I updated the NSF with the correct bank data so everything should work fine now.</strong>
<br />
<br />Also, I ripped a bunch of Koei MMC5 games (all have their music code in the same format); however, none of these use the extra sound capabilities of the chip.

<br />
<br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> I ran a few tracks in my NSF debugger and the only MMC5 activity was a single write of $00 to $5015. Why don't you clear the MMC5 sound bit in the NSF header? That would allow them to play on NSF players that don't support MMC5.

<br />
<br />This page will list all the NSFs I have ripped or have been involved in ripping. 
<br />
<br />Also, I cleared the MMC5 bit in the Koei NSF's and re-uploaded them on the page above. Additionally, I filled in composer data that what left blank in some of my previous uploads. I will link to this page from now on for new NSF releases.
<br />
<br />I should probably submit these to Zophar's some day.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />First, let me just say that kingshriek is a true NES hero. Excellent work lately my friend! I've been waiting for some of the NSFs you've done this month since the very beginning of NSFs! So thank you for that.
<br />
<br />Mitsume ga Tooru is one of the least known about excellent games on the system. Music included. Can't believe you made that one!
<br />
<br />As for requests. I've noticed that there isn't a "<strong>Contra Force</strong>" NSF as of yet. This saddens me because the music in the game is trademark Konami gold.
<br />
<br />Also, there is yet to be a <strong>Pinbot</strong> NSF.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@Norrin_Radd: Thanks for the compliments. I'm happy that my NSFs are being enjoyed.
<br />
<br />@Matrixz: Since, I've started ripping NSFs, I have learned that there are quite a bit more floating around out there than what's listed at Zophar's. Other NSFs I know I've duplicated are Kick Master and Laser Invasion (listed as Gun Sight at ZD). Thanks for the heads up on your NSF page - I'll make sure not to duplicate anything else on there.
<br />
<br />As for requests, I have one. Although it's not exactly an NSF request, it being fulfilled will lead to an NSF. Lately, I've been looking at Cleopatra no Mahou. It has the same music format as Nakayama Miho's Tokimeki High School (which I've done), so it shouldn't be hard once I have all the data necessary. But this is where the problem lies. 
<br />
<br />Like many FDS games, the music is split across a lot of banks (Tokimeki High School had 9!), and for each bank, an address (for init) needs to be written explicitly. To find these, I basically have to play through the entire game - not an easy task when your Japanese is as poor as mine. For Tokimeki High School, I was able to find a guide/kouryaku, so it wasn't a problem. I've had no such luck with Cleopatra no Mahou. So if anyone has played through this game and can help me or can point me to a walkthrough, I'd greatly appreciate it.

<br />
<br />before you're fixed Rollergames NSF, I had to hook up my NES to my PCs audio line in, and record each levels music one at a time into wav files. That game gets mighty hard and frustrating toward the end too haha. I could have used the rom but level ones music was glitchy.
<br />
<br />To summarize; I've been there dude, and it's definitely poops McGee.
<br />
<br />
<br />I've noticed there is also no <strong>Super Cars</strong> NSF out there. Wicked music.
