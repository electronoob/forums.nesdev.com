For example, all .bin files might get associated with a Sega Genesis emulator. The Game Boy Advance ROM format has no header (apart from the data actually on the cart, which has a fairly standardized first 192 bytes), and ROM dumps used to be distributed with a .bin extension. But nowadays, it's most often .gba so that it can get associated with VisualBoyAdvance (as long as you <a href="http://filext.com/file-extension/gba" class="postlink">don't have GrabIt installed</a>).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FitzRoy wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And since SAV is not used by emulators</div>
<br />GBA and DS emulators use .sav files, which are headerless files that contain the data on the emulated cart's flash or SRAM. I believe .sav was used over .srm because a lot of GBA games have serial EEPROM, parallel flash, or FeRAM instead of actual SRAM, and all DS games have EEPROM or flash over an SPI port.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From what I remember all Super FX chips have the same instruction set. The only differences are their clocking method, maximum speed, and maximum ROM. Some clock with the pin signal on the cart port. Others have it inside the cart. Mario Chip and GSU-1 support only 8 Megabits of ROM. GSU-2 supports 16 Megabits. I believe Mario Chip and GSU-1 can only run at 10.5mhz while GSU-2 can run at 21mhz. 
<br />
<br />So games that use the 21mhz speed may not run very well on Mario Chip or GSU-1 boards, other not run at all if they are bigger than 8mbits. The other issue is WRAM on the board. Not all games have the same amount, some is battery backed.

<br />
<br />It's easy to say that. Do you have any idea how much of a pain in the ass the SuperFX is?
<br />
<br />- cannot simultaneously access ROM+RAM on both CPU and SFX
<br />- no call / return
<br />- no stack
<br />- no division
<br />- separate opcodes to specify source and dest registers + alternate modes:
<br />from r1
<br />to r2
<br />alt3
<br />add r3  //same as adc r3,r1,r2; an assembler can reduce, but have fun with a debugger
<br />- insanity-incuding ROM+RAM buffers and L1 instruction cache (good luck profiling your code)
<br />- pipeline that executes the next instruction no matter what, eg:
<br />beq next
<br />inc r0  //this gets called regardless of whether or not the branch was taken
<br />...
<br />next:
<br />stop  //supposed to stop the GSU, and yet ...
<br />getc  //this gets executed no matter what
<br />
<br />The SuperFX is a waste of time. The SA-1 is vastly superior, it's just that no games using it really bothered to utilize the chip, whereas they pushed the SuperFX well beyond its limits (as evidenced by the ~5fps framerates of most games.)

<br />The CPUs in the Nintendo 64 and Sony's PS1, PS2, and PSP systems are based on the MIPS architecture. It has a similar branch delay slot. MIPS assemblers can be set to a mode where they swap the last two instructions if there is no dependency; otherwise, they insert a nop (e.g. ORI $at, $at, 0).
<br />
<br />But Super FX or no Super FX, easier access to Super NES homebrew can only be a good thing.

<br />Emulation can be just as good, and better with digital audio and video, it's just a matter of improving the emulation.

<br />I'm glad to see someone sees it similarly to how I do -- like I said, these flash carts are something we needed 10-15 years ago.  People really aren't doing much with the SNES/SFC at this point in time.  The NES/FC gets a lot more attention because, well, fanboyism.

<br /><ul><li>The 3 colors </li><li>Dark versions of the 3 colors for shading </li><li>Light versions of the 3 colors for highlights </li><li>Halfway colors for smoothing edges </li><li>Black, gray, and white </li></ul>
<br />Some people use only 7 colors in each sprite so that they can get more palettes and/or store the sprite cels smaller. This is common on the Genesis where there are only four lines of 16 colors, and I've seen it in Super Mario World too.

<br />
<br />The SNES can have 7 color sprites (if the last bitplane is filled automatically by the programm by OR-ing the 3 other bitplanes) or 15 color sprites. I guess I could do SNES-dev and draw everything in 7 colors to make the transition smoother (and pretext I need to save ROM).
