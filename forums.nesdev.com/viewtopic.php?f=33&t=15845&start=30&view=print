		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry guys, didn't mean to leave everyone hanging... Real life is busy, who has time for hobbies? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I've made a tentative updated guide for 2017 <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&amp;t=16019" class="postlink">here</a>.  Once we get this finalized, I will cross-post on Nintendoage.  Does anyone else have any recommendations where we should post this?<br /><br />This thought just came to me now, but I'd love to do some kind of collab with the NSF scene and include a jukebox on the cartridge. Thoughts?  This might also be a good way for artists to offer up music services for people who don't have time to write their own, or don't have the music skills.<br /><br />Another thing I had in mind was how the prize money worked last year.  Previously, the cartridge was already released before we decided on prize money.  Now we have no idea how well it will sell (honestly I'm not really worried, but arguments have been made that the scene is getting slightly saturated). I think we are sitting pretty good with funds, but Paul might be able to clear this up for us.<br /><br />The only other suggestion I had off-hand was if someone who is very familiar with the Multicart mapper would be willing to put together a well commented/documented template for an absolute beginner (which maybe other volunteers could convert to different assemblers).  Essentially just a little shove in the right direction to get a beginner using the best practices for inclusion on the multicart.<br /><br />*edit:  One more thing! Did anyone have an opinion on giving the competition it's own dedicated domain? I'd like to avoid any animosity between the different forums and demographics.

This is more than enough to cover printed materials and contributor cartridges for vol3.  My poll of CIB boxes of traditional cardboard vs. bitboxes on both <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=16006" class="postlink">nesdev</a> and <a href="http://nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&amp;threadid=174286" class="postlink">NA</a>, results show a favor towards traditioinal boxes.  To help offset the investment of traditional boxes I'm planning to make a number of limited edition cartridges available to the general public.  That will help us recover the printed material costs rather quickly compared to 2 years later like we had with vol 2.<br /><br />In short, our finances are very healthy.  I see no issues in awarding prize money immediately as winners are announced just as we did last compo.  If anything we have a surplus of funds, that we can afford to utilize for anything we see fit.  Larger/more prizes in the form of cash or physical goods.  Web hosting fees, etc.<br /><br />I've heard some people make similar comments about the market being saturated, or on the decline.  From my perspective I see absolutely no evidence of this, all things I see argue the opposite.  The homebrew community, and sales are stronger than they have ever been, and continue to grow.  Applying the word saturation to the homebrew market doesn't even make sense to me honestly.  But I haven't heard the arguements either.<br /><br />My only guess as to where the sense that the market is saturated is when looking at limited edition NA homebrew auctions.  When developers first started offering these auctions collectors went wild and emptied their pockets in the excitement.  With growing popularity and frequency of those types of auctions, collectors started to get more realistic with how much money they're able to spend on LE auctions.  I view that as an over reaction initially, which didn't take long to settle down to the reasonable level it is now.
