		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello,<br /><br />I am planning on designing on a flash programmer. My only experience with this level of digital electronics was when I built the official GB Flasher, which actually uses an FTDI chip to do serial communications UART over USB to the micro controller.<br /><br />I heard about those native USB microcontrollers out, the AT90USBxxx devices. What I was wondering is, would I want to investigate more into this device or some different way of flashing a memory chip? Are there any different ways besides serially? Or should I just stick to the FTDI method. Either way, I have to learn entirely about the method.<br /><br />Moving on, one of my gripes with the flashing of the memory is how long it takes to do so. Is the FTDI and baud rate responsible for such slow operation? I'm talking, not out of my ass, but a little outside my knowledge. Either way, I am keen on finding a faster method of flashing the memory, I just hope it is not outside the scope of my time and learning.<br /><br />Thanks for the help dudes,<br />anything works, appreciate it!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, well I want to cover 2 things :<br /><br />1) I was originally designing a plan for designing an Eprom Emulator for a SNES cart. It would use SRAM. Now I have the following question on that:<br /><br />If I had an SRAM chip the same specifications as a flash chip. Would it still program faster? The reason I ask is because I was planning on designing an Eprom Emulator for when I do real design of a snes game. Using the emulator would allow me to never have to unplug the game from the SNES. I'm getting a little more into design, but I was wondering if people were saying about Eprom Emulators that they save time only because of not having to unplug the flash rom to program it. is it actually also faster in itself to send the same bits to SRAM? I am asking in the case of the chip being the same speed in ns as the flash chip. However, I am of course also aware that SRAM chips appear to be available at much higher speeds than what I see for flash (in what, the 1 time I searched. I believe I have plans with a 20ns chip(s))  Either way, it's most definitely going to be faster since I plan to design it to be able to stay in a powered SNES even when re-programming, using the Soft-Reset capabilities of SNES (something I vaguely studied here on nesdev forums, about grounding the reset pin on SNES cart).<br /><br />2) The answer to #1 will help me answer #2.. If I cannot hope to find satisfactory / near instantaneous times with the SRAM chip, I wonder what other mediums are available to me? <br /><br />I must also take note that the size of the ROM to upload has a positive effect on this. With a game like SMW being 4Mbit, I imagine how could I make my own game bigger than that. And in that case, what would that load time be?? The answer to that question, if unsatisfactory, would mean I definitely want a faster approach. But if load times for 4Mb are satisfactory, perhaps I could put up with it.

Either way, you should get your feet wet before you reach for something larger.

In practice, you're limited by the speed of the serial link between the EPROM emulator and the host computer. That can be fast if you use Hi-Speed USB, but not if you're trying to get in through controller port 2.<br /><br />* PSRAM, or pseudo-static RAM, is DRAM with its own refresh circuit to make it appear as SRAM to the rest of the system.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I must also take note that the size of the ROM to upload has a positive effect on this. With a game like SMW being 4Mbit, I imagine how could I make my own game bigger than that. And in that case, what would that load time be??</div><br />The speed depends on how you plan to connect the EPROM emulator to the computer and to the memory: whether it's a device that sits on the A bus, a device that sits on the B bus, or a device that takes the memory off the bus entirely. The PowerPak Lite for NES, for example, is an SRAM cartridge that uses the CopyNES, an A bus peripheral soldered into the NES, to transfer information over a cable.

I have put in boldface everything that does NOT pertain to the SNES.<br /><br />If you're going to tell me that you're working with a format that is larger than 12MB, you're working with a format that requires a substantially more complicated controller than just flat memory. (GBA, DS, PSP, N64, &amp;c) You will need programmable logic for any of them to work.
