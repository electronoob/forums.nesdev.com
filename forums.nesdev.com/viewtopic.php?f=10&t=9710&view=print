		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello Guys,<br /><br />My TOP853 came a few weeks back... I also purchased some ST M27C512-15f ICs (maybe these are the problem?). Currently for practice I just have an nrom from othello donor, and I'm trying to put Bomb Sweeper (homebrew) on it. I downloaded the rom, used famirom to break it it into png and chrs, I selected 512 since that's the chip I'm working with, I put the the chip into the programmer, load the bin, and write to the chip. in order to test the chip I'm attempting to do this this: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nintendoallstars.w.interia.pl/romlab/nesock.htm">http://nintendoallstars.w.interia.pl/romlab/nesock.htm</a><!-- m --> I throw it into my nes system and turn it on. Nothing happens but a gray screen. I Also want to note that I have the cover off the Nintendo so I can just plug the board in without the cart and I noticed a flash come from the little window on a few of the chips, afterwards I tried placing them into my eprom programmer and it did not see a chip, I take it these chips are dead?  Thanks for any feedback you can provide.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />UVEPROM are really sensible (in luminosity and in tension), I hope you have other chips to test ?<br />Because high UV luminosity is needed to ERASE those, I would recommend you to hide the &quot;window&quot; with some sort of black cover.<br />It's common to see round black sticker in it, but you could use scotch + black paper.<br /><br />Normally, if I'm not wrong, a programmer with his software let you check the EPROM after writing it.<br />Also if not, you could do a &quot;reading&quot; and compare the binary from the source.(there also tools for that, like hex-editors)<br />If you're not able to read it after writing it, this could be the problem.<br /><br />Considering split, I remember using &quot;Ucon64&quot;, which work pretty well.<br />Famirom should do the task, maybe check the size ?<br />BombSweeper.prg should be 16Ko (2^14 = 16384 octets) and BombSweeper.chr should be 8Ko (2^13 = 8192 octets)<br /><br />It seems that &quot;FAST &amp; EASY EPROM TEST SOCKET&quot; could be the issue : maybe you have some pins which are not in full contacts ?<br />If you have a multimeter, trace the pinouts from the expansion port to the EEPROM (resistances should be less than 1 ohm).<br />The wiki (if you haven't already checked) :<br /><a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Mask_ROM_pinout" class="postlink">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Mask_ROM_pinout</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NROM" class="postlink">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NROM</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_expansion_port_pinout" class="postlink">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_expansion_port_pinout</a><br /><br />Regarding all of those things, I remember buying some EEPROMs which have half memory dead.<br /><br />Hope this will Help You.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@Raccon,<br /><br /><br />Thanks for the tip.<br /><br />I bought a lot of 27c512 ic chips (all diffrent brands) so I don't think its that. I've just desoldered the legs and set the ic chips in there and I get the gray box still. I take it I will have to solder it in place to know if it will work? or make a test cart? I realized that alter ego fits on nrom also so I decided to go with that for my reproduction. I used readnes3 to split it into a chr and prg, I then copied both files onto themselves until they added up to 64kb each (used copy /b, char was originally 8kb and prg was 32).  I have everything right down to a T as far as I can tell. I also have verified the writes to the chip and I it confirms. Please advise <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> Also I'll take some snap shots of the board, upload the files I'm using and tkae some screen shots of the steps I'm doing in the software... Thanks for replying <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Just for you to know, EEPROM are better than UVEPROM and  reprogrammables.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I take it I will have to solder it in place to know if it will work? or make a test cart?</div><br />Absolutely, the best thing is to solder cheap electronic socket like this : <a href="http://www.futurlec.com/Sockets/ICS28.shtml" class="postlink">http://www.futurlec.com/Sockets/ICS28.shtml</a><br />This will let you place and remove Eproms for testing, also adding an extra socket is a good tip (so there one soldered and one attached to an eprom wich could be more easily collapsed and removed with each other)<br /><br />If you need to be helped for soldering materiels, just ask ?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also I'll take some snap shots of the board, upload the files I'm using and tkae some screen shots of the steps I'm doing in the software...
