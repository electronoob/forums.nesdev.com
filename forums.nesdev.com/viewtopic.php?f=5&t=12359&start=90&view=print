The positives should outweigh the negatives.</div><br />I completely agree with you here. Except that your 20% is my 80% and that my 80% is your 20%, this is why I &quot;switched to&quot; windows 7, while you didn't. For me the graphical interface doesn't matter nearly as much as what is behind it, although I like the standard/classic Windows interface and I am annoyed they keep fixing things that aren't broken.

You should update to 1.12.x!&quot; -- uhhhhhhhh uh huh, right...)<br /><br />I'm also 100% certain I'm missing a few others that just don't come to mind right now.  I <strong>KNOW</strong> there are tons of PC games which also refuse to install on XP -- the most hilarious of them is <a href="http://archive.news.softpedia.com/news/Halo-2-and-Shadowrun-Are-Possible-With-Windows-XP-56467.shtml" class="postlink">Halo 2</a>, where the game on Vista/7/etc. uses DirectX 9 but refused to install on XP, so people came up with a hack that lets it run (and it works fine, which to me is proof that software authors were just flat out being anti-XP dicks).<br /><br />But what rainwarrior says is true -- the list is growing.

Ability to access more than one independent secure web site on a single IP address requires Server Name Indication, which doesn't work in IE on XP. (You can put multiple hostnames in the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">subjectAltName</tt> field of one certificate if all sites are operated by the same entity. But this won't be true of sites operated by different customers of one shared host.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd also be willing to bet that recent (circa late-2013-plus) Intel GPUs also don't have XP drivers either -- that's speculative on my part, but odds are I'm right.<br /><br />And that, as I mentioned very early on in this thread, is the scariest part for me -- that if either my motherboard or video card dies, I'm downright forced to upgrade my OS because XP drivers aren't being created any more (motherboard vendors can't provide something that the manufacturer chooses to no longer build).  That is the main reason I &quot;&quot;&quot;want&quot;&quot;&quot; to upgrade, but things like fonts rendering like crap is a huge deal-breaker for me.<br /><br />Oh, and to answer Tepples' question about getting a Macbook and running Linux on it -- not going to happen.  In my experience, Apple products tend to use chips that generally do not have drivers available for them (and for those which do, the quality of the driver is sub-par in comparison to something used in a non-Apple product).  <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBook#MacBook_Pro_with_Retina_display" class="postlink">Take a look at this list</a> (including some of the other Macbook products which are even newer) and you'll see what I mean.  For example, for the Air, &quot;no driver for webcam&quot; is a deal-breaker -- I imagine at least one person reading this saying &quot;koitsu you are just here to whine you bitchy fuck&quot; -- because I work remotely 100% and things like Google Hangouts for daily collaboration and WebEx for company presentations and meetings are pre-reqs, no questions asked.  Then go look at all the &quot;weird wonky bugs&quot; throughout the page (the storage subsystem ones really do not sit well with me, especially considering that's a forte of mine).  You're better off using the OS the vendor intends -- same goes for a bunch of PC products too (those multimedia control keys and their related drivers/utilities are often a sore spot).<br /><br />And yes, IE 8 and older on occasion cause websites (for example, nVidia's download section) to pop up nastygrams about how &quot;the site doesn't support that browser&quot;, even though there's really no technical justification for that either (rephrased: web designers just want to inundate you with the latest trendy working-draft garbage rather than just providing something clean/concise and staying out of your way).  The SNI issue is with IE specifically; Firefox on XP, Chrome on XP, etc. all use updated SSL libraries that do SNI properly, so technically speaking it's not an OS limitation.  But lack of SNI is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication#Client_side" class="postlink">also a problem in tons of other products</a> (Tomcat not supporting it is hilarious, and one that isn't mentioned on that list is postfix (<a href="http://www.postfix.org/TLS_README.html" class="postlink">reference</a>, search for SNI, look at 3rd result)), so it's not just old-IE-specific.  Meaning: if you run a webserver and you want to be 100% compatible with all devices out there, you need to assume SNI is not available, which means each SSL vhost gets its own dedicated IP and name.  That's how I did it on Parodius for many years.

I've been told countless times that I'd get used to them. I don't. I've tried them plenty. I've tried eating them regularly, to no avail. I frequently end up eating them by accident. Onions suck, and I'll always hate them. It has nothing to do with pride, and everything to do with HOW THEY TASTE TO ME.
