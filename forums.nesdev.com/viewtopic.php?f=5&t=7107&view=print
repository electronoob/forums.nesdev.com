<br />
<br />First of all, This is going to be a (Seriously) very active project. It's called Project: Time Bird, (Literal Translation of a game of the same name, Japanese: Toki Tori).
<br />
<br />Here is what I got (and need) so far as of now
<br />
<br />1: When I looked at the SRAM at a hex editor in Toki Tori GB, It contains 2 ascii strings that say the same name: EGGBERT (What the?),
<br />
<br />2: Eggbert is actually the original Toki Tori, for the MSX2 and up. So they were appearently going to be calling him that but all that gore that is now gone in the development process! (There is blood in Eggbert, but not Toki Tori)
<br />
<br />3: Even if I hacked Eggbert, Most stuff is inaccessable without help, I already know the format that the Text (Can be seen with a simple text editor) Music uses (The authors said MSX Protracker?), But not the other formats, such as DAT (BackGround?), SMP(Sample Data?) and CMP (Animations?)
<br />
<br />I know there is unused stuff in the original Eggbert: such as a forgotten Copy-Protection Background/Text (Anti-Pirate?), a unused THE END screen? 
<br />
<br />A few other lost and unused stuff hidden maybe? If so, Can anyone rip the stuff that I cannot see?
<br />
<br />BTW: Fony released it for free, Public Domain/Freeware. I believe you can modify-disassemble-hack it as we like, 
<br />
<br />Credit for MSX.org is neccisary, And that includes the people here who want to help (Anyone along side me can get credit for it!)
<br />
<br />Posted is a opened MSX2 DSK image. Non-Modded and clean (Leads to a MSX.ORG download, Make sure an archive opens with your (un)archiver, IZArc and 7zip (Both Free) might work, as it is a .LZH file!):
<br />

<br />
<br />I apologize if it is not anything anyone really liked to do, I really am trying to act like a smart person and be a total win!
<br />
<br />EDIT: Before Two Tribes: Fony had websites:

<br />
<br />You do not get it: Time Bird = Toki Tori (Japanese)
<br />
<br />EDIT: GB = Game Boy (Color)
<br />
<br />Also, It is not on NES, it is on MSX2, GB and is now on Wii. Iphone, and others. The premise is recovering lost and unused stuff from all variants of this game. for possible use in BMF's The Cutting Room Floor wiki later on!
<br />
<br />I will try MSX.org and tell them all about it later, I am going to school.
<br />
<br />See y'all Later! 
<br />
<br />BTW: I love your NES emu (Sega Li), So I grabbed the recently updated version of Sega Li: version 1.11.4
