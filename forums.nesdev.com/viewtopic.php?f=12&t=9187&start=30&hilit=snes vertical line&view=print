If you wanted to get the same effect horizontally you'd start having issues though (as trying to change the scroll every pixel is just... plain insane, and it may even be cached at the beginning of the <span class="posthilit">line</span> making that impossible).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When I was playing a bit of Ristar and kept noticing that when the top of the water always had the palette-write artifacts in the same spots consistently, the idea of using these writes as a means of actual output crossed my mind but I definitely don't have the know-how to actually do so myself - I'm glad someone utilized the idea!

In English, there's a difference between &quot;screw with&quot;, which is neutral, and &quot;screw up&quot;, which carries a connotation of breakage. The various raster effects on NES hardware, especially the $2006-$2005-$2005-$2006 writes and extending vblank with forced blank, are methods of &quot;screwing with&quot; the PPU to produce a desired, stable result. So are the methods to manipulate so-called &quot;bad lines&quot; on the Commodore 64's VIC-II in order to produce smaller attribute areas, larger sprite counts, border intrusions, and the like. So are the various extended modes of the MMC5, in fact. I was just wondering if toggling mosaic at just the right point on the scanline would trick the PPU into forgetting the mosaic data that it had saved for the scanline and fetch new data for the next scanline instead.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have no idea how the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> PPU works internally at all, but if it's anything like the Mega Drive, it doesn't cache the tilemaps at all but reads them on-the-fly as it rasters. No idea if the mosaic data is cached, though (which could be a possibility, especially since it can work with non-power-of-two values). It's also possible it may work, but only on a 16 pixel granularity (considering that mosaic seems to work on that step amount).<br /><br />Is there any research on how the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> PPU renders each scanline? Maybe Byuu has more info?
