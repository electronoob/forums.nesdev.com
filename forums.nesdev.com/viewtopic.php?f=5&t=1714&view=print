		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm sure many of you guys program for other systems too. I'm pretty sure there is some interest in at least some of the other Nintendo platforms, such as the SNES, GB/GBC and the GBA.
<br />
<br />What I want to ask you is, how do you handle working on projects on different platforms? I am pretty bad at managing projects, and often have too many of them at the same time and work a little bit on each one until I get tired of it, and then put it aside for a while. The problem is that whenever I return to an old project, I start it again from the ground and throw away everything that was previously done. Needless to say, I never complete anything.
<br />
<br />I've been a bit worried the last few days, 'cause i've been developing an increasing interest in the Z80 processor and a few platforms that use it. I don't want to abandon the NES, specially since I've never completed one single cool program for it. I have many many ideas for it.
<br />
<br />I guess this is just temporary, isn't it? Have any of you felt excited about other platforms, but eventually returned to the good old NES? I kinda feel like I'm "cheating" on the NES... Is that weird?

<br />
<br />Having used several debuggers to change all types of assembly, I have a good idea of what I need to be productive on small projects. I won't beat out anyone else here who writes their own players and music and compile them, but I can do a lot of quick-and-dirty stuff to debug from different angles.
<br />
<br />I spend more time looking for ways to use and test my skills on a small scale than I do trying to develope large-scale ones. I can assure you that I never expected to be able to rip NSF files until I found an adequate program for hacking Game Genie codes, and was inspired to go just a step further to get something I'd wanted since NSF files appeared on Zophar's Domain.

<br />How did you know I'm interested on the MSX?!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />
<br />
<br />But it's true. I got an old MSX1 computer from my girlfriend (it was all dusty locked in a closet) a few months back.
<br />
<br />I intend to prepare a little something for MSXdev'06, yes! =)

<br />Because I am too, though in the emulation branch (I've assisted with the unfortunately currently inactive emulator NLMSX). Every sane MSX fan visits msx.org, and that's where I saw you posting.

<br />I just didn't think many people would be interested in it. It is a fairly unknown system in most places...
<br />
<br />I'm still trying to get the hang of it, it is so strange to be a newbie again!!!

<br />
<br />Er, actually, you might have something to worry about.  It's just like learning another language.  For some people, they can learn a new language, and it doesn't interfere with their old language.  Overall, it may boost their intelligence, even.
<br />
<br />Some people, however, encounter destructive interference, where learning a new language interferes with their use of the old language.  And both are spoiled.
<br />
<br />I don't mean to get all serious, but it could happen.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I had fun learning Z-80 when I had the itch to program for S*GA systems, and then when I had had enough, I went over to the PC-Engine.  Sometimes I even look at NES 6502 code.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />  You tend to forget opcodes a bit, and which register is on what system, but overall, it doesn't take more than a few hours to get back in the mood of your favourite system.

<br />You are right. This happens to me with whatever I have ever learned, so why would this be any diferent?

<br />Yeah, I too had a bit of trouble looking at all the LDs and understanding what they did.  Continuing the language analogy, 6502 and Z80 mnemonics are a bit different.  6502 seems to be subject- or agent-oriented, with LD<strong>A</strong>, ST<strong>A</strong> focusing on the memory location and work being done to <em>it</em>; whereas Z80 seems more predicate-oriented, with the <em>action being done</em> taking primacy, and the registers that this LDing is being done to having secondary importance.  But that was just my impression.

<br />You would have to sustain the best level on everythig for your own good, so don't think too much about something else to forget the NES, just make sure to keep first a global aproach of your problems, then code them in the language you must.
