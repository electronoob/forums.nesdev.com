		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I have a couple problems with variables and constants, and having looked at the templates made by tokumaru it's even worse in my head now. I've always been &quot;declaring&quot; variables simply by naming the RAM offsets like: <br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">temp_0 = $00</div><br />These are all in a separate &quot;RAM map&quot; source file which is included in the main source during assembly.<br />Am I really supposed to use the ;MyVariable0 .dsb 1 declaration instead? Or what is exactly happening in both cases?<br /><br />How is .base and .org different exactly? I sort of see that .base has greater significance but I'm not entirely sure about the relation between the two. <br /><br />Are constant declarations done without the $ symbol and that's it?<br />If MIRRORING = %0001, does that mean I can do stuff like lda #%0000|MIRRORING and then A is loaded with #$01?

Or what is exactly happening in both cases?</div><br />Using the equal sign you directly specify what address the variable will use, while .dsb reserves a number of bytes from the current Program Counter onward. Declaring the size of the variables instead of directly defining their addresses helps with maintainability, because you can freely rearrange, add and remove variables without worrying about fixing all the other addresses by hand, which would be tedious and error-prone once you have hundreds of variables.<br /><br />If you're more comfortable using the equal sign, then go with that, but I'll bet you that when your project has grown to the point where you have hundreds of variables and arrays you'll feel the need for something easier to maintain and will look at .dsb again.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">How is .base and .org different exactly?</div><br />When you use them for the first time, they do the same thing, which is set the Program Counter. After that, .org fills the ROM until the address you specify, while .base just resets the Program Counter to the value you specify without filling anything. This makes .base useful for creating multiple banks, because when the end of a bank is reached you can use .base to move the Program Counter back to the beginning and start filling the next one.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Are constant declarations done without the $ symbol and that's it?</div><br />$ is the prefix for hexadecimal, % is the prefix for binary, and unprefixed numbers are decimal. Sometimes (usually when writing to registers, but also when setting some fields in the header) it makes more sense to use binary than hex, it makes the options more readable.

So it's sort of an automated way of creating variables</div><br />Yes.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">which could be global or local to a bank I declare them in I suppose.</div><br />I'm not sure what you mean here... these symbols will always be global, in the sense that they'll be visible everywhere. I do use local variables in my projects though, and here's how I do it:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.enum $0000<br /><br />GlobalVariable1 .dsb 1<br />GlovalVariable2 .dsb 1<br />GlobalVariable3 .dsb 2<br />Page0End<br /><br />.ende</div><br />I put a label marking the end of the global variables, which I can use in other parts of the game as the starting point for the local variables:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.enum Page0Locals<br /><br />LocalVariable1 .dsb 1<br />LocalVariable2 .dsb 4<br /><br />.ende</div><br />I use this kind of local variables for different areas of the game that never run simultaneously. You can even extend this further, by putting another maker at the end of the local variables and use it to declare more variables in sub-areas of each area. I do this for variables local to subroutines mostly. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So does that mean that when I say lda temp_1 it's going to load from $0001?</div><br />Exactly. But since this could change as you add/change variables, you shouldn't count on variables pointing to specific addresses. The idea is to abstract this.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">That is until I re-define temp_1 somewhere else with .enum something that's not $0000.</div><br />I don't think you can redefine symbols like that, the assembler will probably throw an error. ASM6 does have temporary and local labels though, so when I need a variable I can redefine I prepend it with &quot;-&quot;, and make sure the definition is before the code that uses the variable (the same goes for after it's redefined). This is another thing you have to do carefully, because the order in which the code is assembly will matter.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I mean what is the second byte &quot;called&quot; if I declare a variable with .dsb 2? Can I only refer to it as the original name+1?</div><br />Exactly. That's how you normally access multi-byte variables. I even use Name+0 for the first byte in this case, just to make it clear that it's a multi-byte variable.

First because you can't see the assembler's output (because the command window closes too quickly), and that output is essential for debugging assembly errors. Second, because you can't use other features of the assembler, such as the generation of listing files.<br /><br />To create the listing file, you'll have to call ASM6 with -l as the first parameter, and the main source file as the second. If you have ASM6 in the same folder as the main source file, this is as simple as creating a text file named assemble.bat with the following text in it: asm6 -l main.asm game.nes<br /><br />Optionally, you can put a &quot;pause&quot; command (without quotes) in the next line, which will prevent the window from closing before you press a key, giving you time to read the assembler's output. Anyway, just double click the batch file to assemble your project.<br /><br />If the assembler is in a separate folder, you can still create the batch file in the game's folder, but you'll have to write the full path to the assembler. Something like: c:/programs/asm6/asm6 -l main.asm game.nes
