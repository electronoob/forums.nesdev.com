<br />
<br />Since then there has been what is apparently a <a href="http://github.com/psgroove/psgroove" class="postlink">modified recreation of the device</a> released in the form of source code that disables the backup loader but otherwise supposedly works so somebody could make there own for quite a bit less.
<br />
<br />I read about it <a href="http://psx-scene.com/forums/showthread.php?t=65191" class="postlink">here</a>

<br />
<br />Here's, with my usual sarcasm: Welcome pirates! Goodbye Ps3!
<br />
<br />Note:
<br />
<br />Of course this will increase the sale of the console.  But I don't think it will be the same story for the games.

<br />Yoda of the <em>Star Wars</em> series said that fear leads to anger, anger to hate, and hate to suffering. Paul of the Christian New Testament <a href="http://scott.yang.id.au/2002/05/biblical-suffering/" class="postlink">continued the chain</a>: suffering leads to perseverance, perseverance to character, character to hope. But in the opinion of the console makers, homebrew leads to emulation and emulation to piracy of the emulated games. Sony and Nintendo try to stop homebrew. Microsoft, on the other hand, tries to stop emulation by <a href="http://www.pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=XNA#No_procedural_audio" class="postlink">making XNA an uninviting environment for emulator authors</a>.
<br />
<br />As I wrote in <a href="http://pineight.com/rant/wii/" class="postlink">an article about the Wii homebrew scene</a>, I've <a href="http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/32662" class="postlink">fallen <em>out</em> of love</a> with modern consoles. If you want something to use as a PC, buy a PC. Nettops with an ION chipset, such as Acer Aspire Revo, strike a useful balance of size, price, and performance, and even Apple makes <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/" class="postlink">a Mac model</a> that a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_moron_in_a_hurry" class="postlink">moron in a hurry</a> could confuse with a Wii. The advantage of a console used to be that it could output to an SDTV as a standard feature, but that has become less of an issue now that LCD HDTVs appear to be taking over the market.

(I am aware you can hook the controller to a computer but this is a a more tedious process than homebrew enabling the wii and cost money) Also the emulators support light gun emulation, which is not something I have seen or would know how to do on a computer. This allows me to play some of my favorite super scope games despite my super scope being out of commission. (although wiimote is not as accurate as I would like)

The Wii has an internal USB port to which the Bluetooth radio is connected. Once you connect a suitable Bluetooth radio to your PC's USB port, you can use special drivers to make a Wii Remote look like a keyboard+mouse. The most popular driver for doing this system-wide is region coded, but support inside any GPL emulator for Windows or Linux is possible with the "wiiuse" library.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also the emulators support light gun emulation, which is not something I have seen or would know how to do on a computer.</div>
<br />My PC has a mouse, and ZSNES supports Super Scope through the underlying operating system's pointing device interface.

<br />Also I am aware you can connect the wiimote to a computer and I have done so, but I find the process tedious. There are more people with a hacked Wii than who bother to hook up there wiimote to a computer so going that way a lot less people will see anything developed.

Without homebrew, stuff like that would never happen and systems FULL capabilities would never be reached.
<br />
<br />
<br />And most of the stuff made sucks for consoles today, but hey, it's at least a good way to learn PC stuff. XNA is getting a couple GREAT games made that are simple and amazingly fun and best of all, cheap. I can't say how many times I ave played the Miner Dig Deep demo or IMAGWZII. Amazing fun, both games are $1 each! Can't go wrong.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope piracy doesn't get too bad, especially not to run games on, but still. Homebrew is a great thing for consoles IMO.

<br />I have no idea what are "it's limit" because I'm not into modern games much, but I'm sure they're not close to be reached yet. I guess there is that racing game (Grand Turismo 4 was is ?) that had so realistic graphics you couldn't tell it wasn't a film. In fact you could tell because the cars were too perfect and too shiney to be real, but aside of this it was just like reality.
<br />
<br />Now SO many people ask me "Why do you program NES games and not PS3 games ?". That's why I stopped to mention that I program NES games to people :p I don't know what to answer, except that I'd never understand the system as much as I understand the NES.
<br />
<br />The NES is simple enough so I know almost exactly how all it circuits are made. Okay, there is a few dark zones here and here, but I feel like I fully control the system - which might or might not be possible with more modern system.

<br />I think console makers leave some parts of the hardware's behavior undefined or unspecified on purpose so that the console maker could change those parts in a future hardware revision.
<br />
<br />Sony lost me as a potential customer when it killed Other OS.

<br />
<br />But that's not entierely wrong : I can do the art of a NES game myself. For a PS3, I'd have to go with REALLY cheap graphics for the standard of the platform. I probably couldn't even do cell-shaded graphics or 2D isometric.
