MMC1 is super common (thus widely supported) and pretty useful.  There are a few MMC1 titles that use 16kB of PRG-RAM (Genghis Khan is one - probably not so widely supported), but I doubt you'll need more than 8kB, right?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Feb 01, 2009 10:01 am</p><hr />

Stick to the newer emulators that are still being worked on and you will have better chances of mapper support. The MMC5 is indeed the mapper that expanded the NES in more ways than any other.<br /><br />I believe that you should pick your mapper on a project-by-project basis though. Always sticking to a complex mapper could often be overkill. I doubt anyone in the NESDEV community can afford to release a large series of complex MMC5 projects.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Jan 31, 2009 9:11 pm</p><hr />

If you want lots of features you could go with Nintendo MMC-5 for emulation as it's very flexible and powerful, although it doesn't have CHR-RAM technically though some emulators will give it that. Alternatively I recommend FME-7 (Sunsoft) which is mapper #069. <br /><br />You mentioned more PRG-RAM, the MMC5 can have something like 32kb or 64kb of PRG-RAM maximum. You should really just look at mapper documents and find what you like.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Sat Jan 31, 2009 7:47 pm</p><hr />

Hi, I've read about iNES mappers on the Nesdev wiki and got surprised to know that for example, there's a mapper with 128K for CHR-ROM! While I was thinking how to fit all the game's tiles in 4k...<br /><br />Let's say I want to make a library and a game or some app, and I only plan it to be run on emulators, then I could choose the mapper that has more PRG-RAM  and CHR-ROM / RAM possible, right?<br />Because the only concern on using strange mappers with lots of memory is when you have to actually build the cartridges, but if it all remains in software, then there shouldn't be any constraints.<br /><br />Taking this into account, what mapper would you suggest for developing apps for emulators?<br /><br />Do all emulators support all mappers? Or at least most of them?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3773">Petruza</a> — Sat Jan 31, 2009 7:30 pm</p><hr />
