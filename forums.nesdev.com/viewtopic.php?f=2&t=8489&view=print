<br />
<br />I think it would be fun to get a group of us NES Dev'ers to spend a weekend coding a small demo or game, marathon style, and on web camera if available and the coder would not mind. I figure it would be fun going in to it with a concept, notes, and graphics on hand... and then spend the weekend actually coding the game or demo up with all the results posted at the end of the marathon.

<br />In about 2 weeks from yesterday my end-of-term examinations of 3rd semester will start and I won't be able to participate.But it really sounds like fun.I have no web camera, but can use cell phone.
<br />I'm somehow opposite to Bregalad:
<br />Making grafics is a pain.
<br />Making music is REAL pain.
<br />But I can spend hours coding.I just like it very much.
<br />You can count me in depending on date of marathon.

Team work has some benefits for sure, but it does not make things faster in general. In fact, it easily makes them way slower that they could be done with a single person, given the person is capable to do everything that is needed.
<br />
<br />If you mean - every person works on his own game, well, it is doable, but a week mean a very simple game, or low quality. Is the marathon more important that quality?
