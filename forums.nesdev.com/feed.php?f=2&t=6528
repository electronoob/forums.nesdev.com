I just tried modifying the scroll as described in my post and it works great in all emulatos I tried, no glitches. I haven't tried on a real NES though, I think I'll clean up the code a bit and fix other things I broke before doing that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Jun 25, 2010 7:53 pm</p><hr />

But a apparently the automatic change doesn't happen at once, it happens in a window between cycles 251 and 257, so we must watch out for that.<br /><br />Since I plan on making the last two writes ($2005, $2006) during HBlank, that's well past cycle 257, so I should be safe. And as a plus I get to use the actual scroll values I want, instead of having to awkwardly compensate the values for updating the scroll before the automatic increment.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Jun 25, 2010 10:43 am</p><hr />

If you fall between the two (so that, depending on jitter condition, you will write after or before 256) you will get shaking graphics, because in some cases the V scroll will be incremented before your write, and sometimes after.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Jun 25, 2010 3:53 am</p><hr />

Anyway, your suggestion of modifying the scroll "either always before cycle 256 or always after" was kinda vague. Also you don't provide exact timing information, you just say that NOPs should be added/removed until the effect is glitch-free, and I wanted something more specific.<br /><br />It did help a little though, so thanks, but I still had to ask the more specific questions here.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Dwedit wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Go ahead and mess with T<br /></div><br />Thanks Dwedit. I imagine that this should work fine, but when it comes to these low level details I'd rather ask, since some of you (specially emulator authors) know the tiniest details I couldn't possibly know about.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Jun 24, 2010 2:38 pm</p><hr />

Go ahead and mess with T, it's basically the 'Horizontal reset' thingy for each scanline, and the 'Vertical Reset' thingy for the top.<br /><br />The PPU doesn't mess with T in the middle of the frame anyway, it just reads some bits from it every scanline to reset the horizontal scroll.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Wed Jun 23, 2010 11:16 pm</p><hr />

<a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=6515" class="postlink">Neil's thread about mid-screen palette changes</a> got me thinking about mid-screen scroll changes (also discussed in that thread), and I was wondering if you guys had anything to say about this.<br /><br />I already know how to write to $2006, $2005, $2005, $2006 (in that order) in order to set the scroll to any part of the name tables I want, but I'm not sure what would be the best time to do that during rendering (so far I have only done this after extending VBlank, before turning rendering back on).<br /><br />Of course I want the whole thing to take effect during HBlank, so that the next scanline is displayed correctly, but there are a few things to consider:<br /><br />1. The vertical scroll is incremented by the PPU at cycle 251;<br />2. The horizontal scroll is reset by the PPU at cycle 257;<br />3. At the end of HBlank (what cycle?) the PPU starts fetching tiles for the next scanline;<br /><br />I am thinking about making the writes approximately at the following times:<br /><br />$2006: close to the end of the scanline, with pixels still rendering;<br />$2005: close to the end of the scanline, with pixels still rendering;<br />$2005: during HBlank, because the fine X scroll changes right away;<br />$2006: during HBlank, before the PPU starts fetching tiles;<br /><br />I'll of course have some wiggling room, so the first two writes might happen closer to or during HBlank, but the third one definitely happens after HBlank starts.<br /><br />Am I right to guess that there is nothing wrong in messing with T (temporary VRAM address) as the PPU finishes rendering pixels and enters HBlank? Or is this not as simple as I'm assuming, and disabling rendering is a necessity?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Jun 23, 2010 10:51 pm</p><hr />
