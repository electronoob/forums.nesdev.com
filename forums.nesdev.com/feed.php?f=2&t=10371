Got a large amount of code compiling - and achieved buggy-ass collision detection.  Speed is... OK.  I was converting some old Forth code, caught a lot of bugs in the compiler actually.  You really have to be conscious of how efficient your code is.  And of course there are no divides, multiplies, or modulus.  <br /><br />Through this process, I realized that in its current state, without interactive testing it's really only an incremental improvement over C/asm.  There needs to be interactive testing - a pillar of Forth.  Therefore I'm going to write a simulator - basically a program in SwiftForth that lets you compile Eighth programs in &quot;simulator mode&quot; and basically it tries to create the 8-bit environment of the 6502 so you can test out the logic of your various subroutines by typing them into SwiftForth's commandline window and observing the effect on variables and the data stack.  It won't be able to help you with debugging asm words but those are relatively few and short (and you can step through them in a debugger like Nintendulator's or FCEUX).<br /><br />edit: alternatively I was thinking to look into Nintendulator's Lua scripting and implement a dialog to interact with a ROM's compiled Eighth code and asm words using the symbol file.  then you could debug asm words without having to rewrite them in Eighth or Forth so they can work in the simulator.  but then it would require Nintendulator - I don't think that's unfair though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6048">sonder</a> — Fri Aug 23, 2013 9:17 am</p><hr />
