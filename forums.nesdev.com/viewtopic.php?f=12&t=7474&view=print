		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just wondering: I've seen pictures of Super Famicom cartridges that have had the mask ROMs removed and replaced with a sort of converter board that allows a surface-mount EEPROM (TSOP package, I think?) to be plugged into a DIP socket. I have a couple SFC cartridges that I'd like to convert to use patched English ROMs (<em>Final Fantasy V</em> and <em>Seiken Densetsu 3</em>, respectively,) but I'd like to avoid the ugly "cut out a hole in the casing" approach with the "stacked DIP ROMs" method I've seen for SFC cartridge conversion. Are these TSOP-&gt;DIP adapters available commercially? Where could I obtain them? (Also, what do I do for cartridges of odd ROM size like FF5?)

You could try some things, but I don't know what's right. Padding it with zeroes or $FFs is the first most trivial thing I'd try before I sweated trying anything more complex. Assuming you can reprogram the ICs without too much work.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I guess that was a silly question. What I <em>meant</em> to ask was, are they available with an EEPROM already on them? I don't have any surface-mount equipment with which to attach one, so if they're not I'd have to find someone who could do it for me. If I did, what EEPROMs would be appropriate, as far as matching the pinout on SNES mask ROMs?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There aren't going to be adapter boards with flash already soldered on.
<br />Now's the time to learn, I guess. It isn't even that hard-- put a smaller tip in your iron, put down a ton of solder flux, tape the chip down, go over it again with flux, clean your soldering iron tip, put a big droplet of solder on it, drag it across the pins, feed more solder as you're going across if it runs out.
<br />
<br />It will "magically" work for the most part, but use solder braid to get rid of the three or so bridges between pins that do develop.
<br />
<br />No pinouts match the mask chips perfectly, hence the need for an adapter board.
<br />
<br />Anything that is 5 volts with enough address lines and an 8-bit data bus will work.

<br />
<br />No offence/rudeness intended, but it would really help the guy if he was linked a proper, 100% accurate pinout mapping from mask ROM to EEPROM or Flash.  This kind of response mimics what I've gotten from the nesdev community over the years when asking how to re-wire an MMC3 cart to permit EEPROMs (the response of which always is "it's not that hard, you just map pin X to pin Y based on the function of the pin", which though true is <strong>far</strong> from what all is required, pin-mapping-wise).

<br />Yeah, that's kind of the thing. I'd really like to avoid stacking EEPROMs, since that'd require me to cut a big ugly hole in the case, but I'm not sure how feasible that is. Guess I'll see...
<br />
<br />(Also the avatar is because I was making a NES conversion of one of Kurushimi's joke games at one point, for no particular reason. Haven't actually done anything on it in quite a while though.)

<br />There is actual PCB artwork, plus someone was willing to have these made at the time.
