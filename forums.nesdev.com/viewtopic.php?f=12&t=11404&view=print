The way it's been talked about in the past makes it sound like an edge case among edge cases.

I suppose the status bars in question could be done with sprites though.  Just dumping thoughts as I go here...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I thought of using a H-Blank IRQ to change the BG Mode as a possibility under the condition that the GUI actually covered up the background in the process. I could also in theory do this for a port that I am considering, using Mode 7 to simplify the pixel drawing process (I am going to use this to zoom in a display that would normally be very small), but using a different BG mode for displaying something else.

But right now it's late and my brain can't remember which of them which do it...<br /><br />Summoning byuu!  :)</div><br /><br />Mid-frame, yeah, all the time. Mid-scanline, nah, some games toggle BG layers on and off in the middle of a scanline, more of a timing issue usually caused by using IRQs instead of HDMA. ASP also messes with BGSCROLL mid-scanline to surprisingly good effect. And of course ASP also does INIDISP (display brightness) mid-scanline, to less successful effect due to the impreciseness of IRQs to cycle positions.<br /><br />You can definitely write to BGMODE in the middle of a scanline, but I don't know what the consequences will be, as I am too afraid to try it. A lot of registers are cached at various times during the scanline. If BGMODE isn't one of them (and it wouldn't surprise me if it weren't), then you'd probably get what looks like gibberish for the rest of the scanline.<br /><br />Emulating the PPUs perfectly would require perfectly capturing when each variable was read, and mastering the state machine that manipulates those values during rendering. Could easily sink another 5+ years of full-time research into that and likely not even come close to nailing down the extreme edge cases.<br /><br />The practical use, if you could actually pull this off ... would be to have the left-hand side of the screen be one mode (say a text display that wouldn't work with sprites for some made-up reason) and the right-hand side be another mode (probably mode 7.) Ostensibly with black filler pixels between the two sides of the screen. Not all that useful. Sprites are pretty versatile. Maybe doing hires text/art on one side, and mode7 on the other, would be sufficiently unique ...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey thanks byuu.  Your reply actually made me realise a big mistake on my part:<br /><br />The subject in question was with regards to <strong>mid-scanline</strong> mode changes (as in changing $2105 outside of HBlank), and I even said &quot;there are commercial games which do switch modes <strong>mid-scanline</strong>&quot;.<br /><br />But what I said is false/inaccurate -- what I was thinking of (as my subsequent replies implied) were games that tweaked $2105 at the end of a scanline / <strong>during HBlank</strong> (I even have a SNES music pack demo that does that (and boy does it make emulators angry, but I haven't tried bsnes/higan, I imagine that probably gets it right)).<br /><br />No, I don't know of any games that do mid-scanline mode changes, just ones doing it during HBlank.<br /><br />I guess I wasted a bit of everyone's time.  Sorry folks.  I should have paid closer attention/read more slowly.

Unless another heavy gun like nocash has been messing with this, I guess it's safe to assume no one knows.<br /><br />Though the fact that scroll parameters can be changed is encouraging - if the matrix can be changed too, it might be possible to fake a mode change, though I imagine you'd have to mask some garble with sprites (or turn the BG off) because it would take a while to hit up all those registers even with DMA...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The practical use, if you could actually pull this off ... would be to have the left-hand side of the screen be one mode (say a text display that wouldn't work with sprites for some made-up reason) and the right-hand side be another mode (probably mode 7.)

It's a port, so I don't have much design freedom, and the result is that I am so overloaded with sprites that I'm not sure I can reliably stay under the scanline limit (or the global limit for that matter) even if this trick works perfectly.

And I appreciate your willingness to help.  But I have a possibly irrational desire to keep this as far under my hat as I can for as long as I can.  Part of it is that I'd really rather not look like I'm promising something I can't actually pull off, or that will take so long as to be effectively the same thing (ever heard of the Nearly Upright?)...<br /><br />I will say this:  It's a bullet hell game.  The score/lives/etc. are on a textured overlay next to the playfield.  There are way too many independently-moving bullets for the SNES to have a hope of handling them as sprites, so I plan to blit them with the Super FX chip.  The trouble I'm referring to with sprites happens when the playfield is in Mode 7, because I don't have a background layer to blit to.  This means that in the general case the whole playfield is covered in a layer of tiled sprites, which doesn't include the player, the player's bullets or any enemies or powerups unless I can jam them into the palette I'm using for the enemy bullets.  I could rearrange the screen to get the HUD out of the playfield's scanline range, but I'd really rather not...<br /><br />...<br /><br />Fool's errand?  Maybe.  I haven't seen anything yet that looks like an obvious showstopper, but every part of this game seems to be pushing the system in some way; I had to trim the <em>title screen</em> vertically a bit because I ran out of VRAM and DMA bandwidth at the same time...<br /><br />This is why I like the project; it's marginal.  People have actually said that it's impossible, no way no how, and I disagree.  But it's also why I'm asking questions now - I want to establish what's possible before I start.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I doubt any emu support midscanline mode change, so if the hardware supports that, your ROM will probably be hardware-only (until BSNES starts to support this).</div><br />I'm cool with that, as long as I can get my hands on a dev cart with the hardware I need (GSU2, MSU1, maxed-out Game Pak ROM/RAM as well as a full load of backup RAM and a bunch of extra ROM the GSU doesn't know about, which according to the manual is something you can do)...  I'm hoping the sd2snes ends up being that dev cart; it's easily the most promising option I'm aware of...<br /><br />Besides, if I can show something useful working on hardware, at least in the context of a finished game, I'm sure higan will support it before too long...
