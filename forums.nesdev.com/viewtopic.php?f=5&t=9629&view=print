		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I like it very much and it is very useful!<br /><br />I use Windows 7 at work, but the very first thing I did was to disable AERO, and I <em>never</em> knew there was such a feature. So, is it only available in W7 when AERO is enabled? In that case, I wonder whether this tool will work in W7 without AERO.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I haven't tested my program with dual monitors, but I wrote it with dual monitors in mind.  It's supposed to pick the monitor that the active window has the most area covering, and snaps it to that screen.  So if the Win32 API functions work like they should, everything should be fine on dual monitors.<br /><br />As for Windows 7's real Aero Snap feature, it's very nice.  You can also drag a window to the extreme left and extreme right side of the screen, and it will make the window cover the left or right half of the screen.  When you do this, the mouse cursor must touch the edge of the screen.  So getting the window's left edge to the left edge of the screen doesn't matter, the mouse cursor needs to be there for the feature to trigger.  Windows 7 also shows a preview of where the window will be placed.<br />My program doesn't support snapping windows on the screen when dragging them, it only supports the WindowsKey + Left/Right shortcut key.  Which is still damn useful.<br />I don't think the Window 7 Aero Snap feature requires Aero to be enabled, but you can see if the built-in snap feature still works with Aero disabled.  If it doesn't work, use my program.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I like stuff like this: small useful keyboard shortcuts with no bloat. Would it be possible to create something small like this to add &quot;pin to screen&quot; like most xorg window mangers have? I'm not sure if this is significantly more difficult to implement than hooking some keyboard input.

That auto-snapping feature of W7 is annoying as hell(I often intentionally move windows to an edge and for some reasons I like them to be half-offscreen and half-viewable) and I eventually disabled it. BTW, is it possible to make it support WIN+UP and WIN+DOWN to snap windows to the top and bottom halves of the screen? It would be even more useful for the lower (well, 1024x768...) resolution display I am using.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I don't think the Window 7 Aero Snap feature requires Aero to be enabled, but you can see if the built-in snap feature still works with Aero disabled.

I'll try this out in the office tomorrow.
