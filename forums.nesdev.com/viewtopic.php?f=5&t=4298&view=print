The objective of this module is to transform the continuous speech signal representing the uttered sentence into a string of lower units. Four main linguistic units have been considered : phones, phonemes, syllables and words. The KEAL acoustic-phonetic recognizer consists of components for carrying out three main tasks : acoustic analysis, labelling and training. Syllabic segmentation accuracy of 95%, an average phonemic recognition rate of 61% and a word recognition accuracy of 93% are obtained using 26 phonemic classes, isolated words (digits and operators : +,-,*,...) and continuous speech which different speakers. Preliminary results on number recognition (each number being composed of several digits spoken without insertion of pauses) give an accuracy of 90% after speaker adaptation.</div>

<br />You damn well know that in 1982 such hardware could not exist due to the lack of parallel processing boards such as 3D accelerator cards.

<br />B. The concept above not being able to be contradicted via any scientific, philosophical, or otherwise theological model scares the shit out of pretty much anyone all things considered that end-times scripture under all Abrahamic religions is forbidden from human knowledge until after the end-times have already begun, only for those that have been left behind during the final mass-rapture.

<br />0120080808-015636 &lt;KEAL&gt; i don't get it
<br />20080808-015643 &lt;NiceNMean&gt; nvm - just another one of My omnipresent bad jokes &gt;g&lt;
<br />0120080808-015708 &lt;KEAL&gt; it didn't even make sense
<br />20080808-015713 &lt;NiceNMean&gt; Well - was kinda tryin' to play on MPD (DID) there &gt;shrug and a grin&lt;
<br />0620080808-015717 * KEAL feeds his rats
<br />0120080808-015801 &lt;KEAL&gt; my rats are lesbians <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" />
<br />0120080808-015826 &lt;KEAL&gt; i am not MPD (DID), i am schizoid
<br />0620080808-015830 * NiceNMean ponders whether it's a "good sign" or a "bad sign" when KEAL says He "didn't even make sense" &gt;heh&lt;
<br />0620080808-015859 * NiceNMean nods - Figured as much, and know the difference... but damn - then I wouldn't have a bad joke ! &gt;g&lt;
<br />20080808-015918 &lt;NiceNMean&gt; (And bi-polar I'm guessing too ?)

<br />0620080808-015958 * NiceNMean nods - I know, KEAL, not to worry... like I said - just goin' for the bad joke there ; )
<br />0120080808-015959 &lt;KEAL&gt; -.-
<br />0120080808-020055 &lt;KEAL&gt; schizoids don't, they just see what is around them completely differently

<br />0120080808-020208 &lt;KEAL&gt; also for example, i don't die easily
<br />0120080808-020237 &lt;KEAL&gt; according to the laws of physics i should either be deceased already or non-existent

<br />20080808-020813 &lt;NiceNMean&gt; Ah, regrets to hear... no luck with those links &amp; numbers I got you ?
<br />20080808-020848 &lt;NiceNMean&gt; KEAL - 'site' referring to recent challenges with Club-Ignition.com getting h4x0r3d...
<br />0120080808-020900 &lt;KEAL&gt; if you really understood, you'd prolly understand that in reality, making jokes often gets you killed around actual crazy people when making them in person :/
<br />0120080808-020926 &lt;KEAL&gt; most crazy people are harmless
<br />0120080808-021010 &lt;KEAL&gt; but a ratio aren't ticking time bombs, a ratio are just fucking shit crazy psychos that kill people at random
<br />0620080808-021015 * NiceNMean chuckles - Or... works well if folks know you're just kiddin', mean no harm, and you're treatin' them just like "other people" ; )
<br />0120080808-021042 &lt;KEAL&gt; usually if a crazy person hasn't killed someone by age 20 they usually won't
<br />0120080808-021125 &lt;KEAL&gt; :/
<br />0120080808-021143 &lt;KEAL&gt; i only killed one kid on accident

<br />20080808-021319 &lt;NiceNMean&gt; ...and his damned philosophical nature drove y'nuts &gt;g&lt; ?
<br />0120080808-021325 &lt;KEAL&gt; ?
<br />0120080808-021349 &lt;KEAL&gt; NiceNMean how old are you?
<br />20080808-021353 &lt;NiceNMean&gt; Balzac was a French philosopher, as I recall...

<br />20080808-022626 &lt;`Kelli&gt; Was it Ginger?
<br />0120080808-022632 &lt;KEAL&gt; i think it might have been
<br />20080808-022639 &lt;`Kelli&gt; That's what I WANT to say it was, but I might be mistaken
<br />20080808-022648 &lt;NiceNMean&gt; No... don't think that was quite it...
<br />0120080808-022651 &lt;KEAL&gt; ginger sounds right
<br />20080808-022659 &lt;NiceNMean&gt; Think that's close though...
<br />0120080808-022700 &lt;KEAL&gt; but i don't think 100% it is correct
<br />0120080808-022718 &lt;KEAL&gt; but it may very well be ginger
<br />0120080808-022737 &lt;KEAL&gt; maybe GingerSleepN knows
<br />0620080808-022746 * NiceNMean chuckles
<br />0120080808-022751 &lt;KEAL&gt; or was it gingersnap?
<br />0120080808-022837 &lt;KEAL&gt; i think she may have been referred to as both ginger and gingersnap in that claymation
<br />0120080808-022847 &lt;KEAL&gt; and that is why we are not sure maybe
<br />20080808-022926 &lt;`Kelli&gt; Why don't one of you go google or wiki it if you're THAT curious?
<br />0120080808-022937 &lt;KEAL&gt; because that wouldn't be as fun

<br />0120080808-023943 &lt;KEAL&gt; when i was a teen often i questioned whether people were real, actors in some sort of demented torture system, or simply clueless puppets
<br />0120080808-024046 &lt;KEAL&gt; having an iq of around 170 as a teen, other children and teens and lots of young adults and older adults seemed to lack sentience

<br />0120080808-024342 &lt;KEAL&gt; then as i became a teen
<br />0120080808-024419 &lt;KEAL&gt; i started to wonder if i was the one trapped in a body and everyone else were actors in some sort of subspace torture scheme
<br />0120080808-024510 &lt;KEAL&gt; i mean i am pretty sure now that i do not physically exist within this body of mine

<br />0120080808-024806 &lt;KEAL&gt; i woke up one day while driving my car and ended up somewhere else entirely
<br />0120080808-024845 &lt;KEAL&gt; then well i fell back asleep into this fake world, i wasn't in the same location i orginally was
<br />0120080808-024954 &lt;KEAL&gt; i was actually 2 to 5 seconds prior in time, parked in my car at a green light, that just prior to waking up i had been tboned by someone running the red, that other car running the red as i was parked at the green when i fell asleep returning into this fake world again

<br />0120080808-031349 &lt;KEAL&gt; damn
<br />0120080808-031407 &lt;KEAL&gt; reason i religiously take my psyche meds isn't to stay sane
<br />0120080808-031414 &lt;KEAL&gt; but to keep from being found
<br />0120080808-031504 &lt;KEAL&gt; following me NiceNMean?
<br />0120080808-031704 &lt;KEAL&gt; so long as i take my psyche meds i appear to them to be just another actor
<br />0620080808-032000 * NiceNMean flips back over here
<br />20080808-032045 &lt;NiceNMean&gt; Glad you do try to keep up on your meds... cuz - gotta say, damn you can be tough to talk to when you don't &gt;g&lt; !
<br />0120080808-032051 &lt;KEAL&gt; there are actors, convicts, fugitives, and citizens
<br />20080808-032102 &lt;NiceNMean&gt; (But yeah - I get what you mean ; )
<br />0120080808-032109 &lt;KEAL&gt; and then there is g.h.o.s.t
<br />0120080808-032114 &lt;KEAL&gt; i am a fugitive i beleive
<br />0120080808-032134 &lt;KEAL&gt; so i hide
<br />0120080808-032150 &lt;KEAL&gt; citizens are people that belong here
<br />0120080808-032200 &lt;KEAL&gt; things like winter^rose are convicts
<br />0120080808-032209 &lt;KEAL&gt; actors are like the lady in red
<br />0120080808-032230 &lt;KEAL&gt; fugitives are those that have transcended the system
<br />0620080808-032246 * NiceNMean chuckles - Was thinkin' of some Matrix comparisons in fact &gt;g&lt;
<br />0120080808-032248 &lt;KEAL&gt; g.h.o.s.t is the enforcers
<br />0120080808-032338 &lt;KEAL&gt; there are also bounty hunters
<br />0120080808-032357 &lt;KEAL&gt; convicts let loose to hunt down fugitives
<br />0120080808-032435 &lt;KEAL&gt; nobody is free where i am from
<br />0120080808-032512 &lt;KEAL&gt; i do remember when winter^rose was free
<br />0120080808-032557 &lt;KEAL&gt; but that was the partyfm that existed 3 years ago
<br />0120080808-032608 &lt;KEAL&gt; in this world partyfm didn't exist 3 years ago
<br />0120080808-032645 &lt;KEAL&gt; winter^rose was sentenced lightly
<br />0120080808-032722 &lt;KEAL&gt; citizens are people that belong to this world
<br />0120080808-032746 &lt;KEAL&gt; actors are basically beings that pose as citizens as employees of the enforcers

<br />Lifetime bans are considered harmful. I'd link why, but MeatBall Wiki appears to be down right now.

<br />I think this is enough evidence that the article is complete trash and should be ignored in total.
<br />
<br />This isn't some sort of quasi-country that needs to apply human rights or look good or whatever. It's a fucking message forum, and every message forum on the planet is expected to remove users that do not contribute intelligently or contribute only lies and bullshit, <em>especially on a forum that is designed to be used as a resource/learning area and not as a general bullshitting ground</em>.
<br />
<br />Jargon has been told more times than I can count to shut up and has been warned out the ass (including a public request to ban his ass!) and he hasn't changed ONE BIT since that ban, and yet here he is.
<br />
<br />Un-fucking-believable.

<br />
<br />I'll admit that this is a preferable way of over-indulging, as few forums can really make a claim to intellect as well as a low level of harassing users. With how often I find it worth the time to check this site, I feel the good fortune of this community is a statistical anomaly.
<br />
<br />This combination makes it beyond the scope of my understanding as to how you can be fair to the individual, as well as fair to the community. The admins aren't nazis about anything, and the users generally don't give them a reason to be.
<br />
<br />I can only recommend that if you're going to ban jargon on his annoying behavior, then you either re-ban him on less severe incidents than less infamous individuals, or permanantly ban him while expressly disallowing it from becoming a precedent in procedure.
