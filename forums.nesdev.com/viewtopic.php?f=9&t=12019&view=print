I am assuming you are pulling data in the same way the NESRGB board is. <br /><br />Defaults are going to be hard to figure out for the palettes, but I would very much favor the following picture scaling / dimensions:<br /><br />-1080p output resolution<br />-4:3 letterboxing with the image centered<br />-The internal 256x240 image is scaled to an integer multiple with nearest-neighbor, then scaled with interpolation to the full target size (this maintains pixel clarity while eliminating &quot;fat pixels&quot; <br /><br />If the palette can look like the NESRGB palette for what is intended to resemble a &quot;normal&quot; NES, I would be happy with that color palette.<br /><br />A few questions:<br /><br />-How many frames' worth of latency do you have from the input to the output?<br />-Is the output refresh rate locked to the vertical sync of the captured image, so that there is no tearing nor the need to drop frames to compensate for drift (my biggest gripe with the XRGB mini / XPC4)?<br />-Do you have plans on digitizing the analogue audio and encoding it in the HDMI output?

The HDMI is emitted a couple scanlines after the NES' PPU generated it.  <br /><br />Since the two are interlocked, there's no tearing or frame duplication or removal.  Anything that gets dropped or modified after this point will solidly be your TV/monitor's fault.  The HDMI generated by the board is fully standard complaint 60.00fps video and does not have its timing modified in any way.  The NES is very very slightly underclocked to do this, around 0.15%.  This is small enough that it isn't humanly detectible.  <br /><br />There is no analog input capability, but this is not a problem.  I plan on having ALL the expansion chip audio implemented on here too.  The verilog for all of those is written (yes even VRC7) so I can in theory drop this in.  <br /><br />Right now I have implemented the usual 5 NES audio channels. These are written in verilog and dupilcate the NES APU's audio functionality.  This netted me a noise free digital version of the audio.  DPCM was an interesting case because I have to generate it from the data the NES CPU fetches!  I cannot just play DPCM samples;  I must fetch the data off the bus as the CPU is reading it for playback, and generate my copy of the DPCM in synchrony with the CPU's.  <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">In my opinion, pixel aspect ratio should match the PAR of the original TV system: 8:7 for NTSC or roughly 11:8 for PAL.

There's no way to add zoom, I do not have a frame buffer so I'm greatly constrained in the Y direction.  I have full free control of the X direction though-  I can easily stretch and shrink in this dimension.

I have an EDTV with 480 lines, so this would look perfect.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A 1080p TV will probably be scaling 1080-line video anyway because it assumes video is still authored for early adopter 1080-line CRT HDTVs that have overscan. A TV that assumes overscan will chop about 3% off each side and blow the rest up. A computer monitor won't assume overscan. But computer monitors often won't have audio output, so you may have to provide a separate headphone jack with analog audio on it.<br /><br />How do you plan on making this available to the public? (Wishful thinking) Could you buy dead NES Control Decks, scavenge parts, refurbish them into working consoles, install fresh caps as needed, and install this mod?<br /><br />I plan on developing a ROM that tests exactly how much an NES has been overclocked, by assuming that the line rate is ~15.7 kHz and counting the cycles that the PPU takes to render 240 lines. Will I have testers?

Especially being able to get 60 fps output instead of interlaced 30 fps without an expensive converter would be great. I suppose it depends on how much this costs, as well. Do you have to desolder both the PPU and CPU to install?<br /><br />I`d actually like to see the whole package, new and clean though. My old NES is a bit temperamental, and of course there`s the ZIF connector hassle. I'd love an all-new replacement.
