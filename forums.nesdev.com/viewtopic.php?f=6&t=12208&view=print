Something like this happened when I tried to do a revamp of SMB2j's ending music to work in SMB1 (NES version) in case I wanted to work on it, so the only one I used to fix this is a comparsion-and-reconstruction of it using Beneficii's old disassembly as the base for the alternate music engine<br /><br />It's a (dis)assembly error, I think, and I know it's not your fault.<br /><br />EDIT: Check the Victory Music Header loading routines, If they are unmodified, that's where it might've gone wrong, not 100% sure though, maybe it's more than that...<br /><br />Also there needs to be two more bytes at the end of the VictoryMusEnvData as another fix (the last two were shared as the first two bytes of WaveformHeaderOffsets in the original disk)

Or, you can just download my FDS version in where I do that, princess scene included. Anyway, I promised you a free copy of the SMB1 promo if you test it like I want you to in the PM.<br /> <br />EDIT2: I don't understand what you mean about the &quot;VictoryMusEnvData&quot;. How do you know two bytes are missing?

Which .asm file are you referring to??? If you mean sm2data3.asm then at that line it's got a CMP for something irrelevant; if you mean sm2main.asm then that too is irrelevant. So again, what do you mean?<br /><br />I have a copy of Beneficii's disassembly but you've basically interpreted his note as a whole which has nothing really to do with what you mean (as far as I can see):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;note that first byte of PCMDataHeader is loaded first from SquRegisterData<br />;should keep that address more or less the same (retarded I know)<br />;you can probably just get away with adding an extra byte to the data<br />;if it's a problem<br /><br />;(note that first byte of PDH is the last byte of SquRegisterData)</div><br /><br />It's saying that if you edit the &quot;SquRegisterData:&quot; to add the $95 back at the end since the first byte of PDH makes use of it. So add a $95 at the end if you edit the music data.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">SquRegisterData:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $97, $98, $9a, $9b, $9b, $9a, $9a, $99, $99, $98, $98, $97<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $97, $96, $96, $95 ;ShaneM note, last byte made use of by PDH</div><br /><br />So again, why did you choose to add a $02 after &quot;VictoryMusEnvData:&quot; (&quot;SquRegisterData:&quot;) and why a $02? Why are you using an unlabeled copy of SMB2J source when you have access to doppleganger's fully labeled SMB2J source???

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I guess it was my choice, I only used the music part of beneficii's disassembly even before Doppelganger's version!<br /><br />Explanation: $02 was the byte that was shared in between those data segments according to the listings of the original SMB2j disassembly build, even if Doppel did not mention it being shared!<br /><br />Leaving it as-is would be OK, I guess...<br /><br />EDIT: What I mean is it's in Doppel's original version of the SM2DATA3 portion of the SMB2j disassembly, Where the ending coding resided, so yeah...
