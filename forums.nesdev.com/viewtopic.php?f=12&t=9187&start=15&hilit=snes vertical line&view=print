The idea would be to use additive blending (so the components from both layers are added), then put two components in the 256 color tilemap and the remaining component in the other (OK, other kind of combinations could be done if needed, but the idea is to add the values essentially).<br /><br />And yes, I know, this may not seem to have much practical use - the Mega Drive demo has even less practical use since the bitmap is in ROM (it can't fit in RAM) and almost all CPU time is eaten up by the DMA (as the DMA halts the CPU). The idea is just to do it somehow.<br /><br />(that said, it's not that useless... as I said, in the case of the Mega Drive the idea works like wonders when combined with the Mega CD, and in the case of the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> not only you aren't halting the CPU if we go the way we're discussing right now, but there's always the possibility of using co-processors in the cartridge too like several games did)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">In all cases, if you use mode 4, you can get a second tilemap with 2BP tiles.

You're right it would be possible to combine two different BGs with mosaic set for a higher colour depth.<br />However there is no mode with mulitple 8BP BGs, therefore you'll have to deal with mode 1 or mode 2's 4BP BGs.<br />But then there is only 16*16 = 256 colours possible on each tile - no gain from mode 3 or 4.<br /><br />So you'll have to use the same VRAM area for 8BP tiles and 4BP tiles at the same time in mode3 - possible but sounds complex to me !<br /><br />In other words, yes you'll get more than 256 colours, but at the price of using huge &quot;pixels&quot; and two BGs, when you could just stick with 256 colours in mode 3/4 it would be simpler and look better in 99% of cases.

Let's assume we went for the same amount of precision - RGB 3.3.3 (512 colors). Yes, we could do better, but let's start there. Each RGB component would require 3 bits. So, what we could do is store two of the components using the 8bpp palette (64 colors would be needed) and store the remaining component in the 4bpp palette (8 colors would be needed). That should certainly be doable with mode 3. We're only using 72 colors in CG, so we could probably expand this further (that's a topic for later).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">So you'll have to use the same VRAM area for 8BP tiles and 4BP tiles at the same time in mode3 - possible but sounds complex to me !</div><br />Do you mean sharing the tilemap table or what? I was calculating, and the tiles would take up 42KB (assuming we do 32×28 and not 32×30, and we do the mosaic thing)... that leaves 22KB for other stuff. Isn't that doable?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">In other words, yes you'll get more than 256 colours, but at the price of using huge &quot;pixels&quot; and two BGs, when you could just stick with 256 colours in mode 3/4 it would be simpler and look better in 99% of cases.</div><br />Considering the thing we're trying to beat doesn't even have sprites and needs an add-on to be even remotely useful (since it eats up lots of CPU time, and to make it editable you'd need to put RAM in the cartridge as it won't fit in 64KB), this is a lot better.<br /><br />Then again, the whole thing here is just to beat that, not to make something practical. If our aim was the latter then I'd probably avoid using 8bpp graphics (mode 7 aside, as that's unavoidable if I want deformation).

I suppose you could do RGB 3.3.2 on BG1 (not 4.4.3 since the extra bits have per-tile granularity only) and then RGB 1.1.2 on the 16 colors palette, giving effectively RGB 4.4.4. No downsides, other than being more messy.

This is an extremely trivial trick, we only use 14 rows of tiles instead of 28, and would cut the usage in half, both maps will now use half the tiles they were using before : 42kb for both bitplanes, 48kb in total. You even have room left for some sprites <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />PS : Tepples your image shows perfectly that stripping to a 3,3,2 256-colours palettes is not the same as restricing the total colours to 256, which is what I was mentioning.

My idea was to use the odd bits for the top half of the screen, then use the even bits for the bottom half of the screen (which is why the horizontal scroll by 1 in the bottom half). There is no weird overlap between tiles like you say.
