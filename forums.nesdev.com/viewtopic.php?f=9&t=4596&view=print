<br />
<br />I kept my promise. I had a hard time but tonight I was able to make my custom screwdriver and it worked.  I hope the information will contribute everyone.
<br />
<br />Here's the pictures, not prepared yet properly for the bootgod database:

<br />
<br />- The top chip is written sn74HCUO4N
<br />- It's a MMC1B2
<br />- HVC-SXROM-01

<br />I hope you're now happy to see it.  I will try to open a few other ones if I can find the time to do it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh this is awseome.
<br />It would be great to definitely know where A13 and A14 (pin 26 and 1 respectively) of the 32kb SRAM chip (maked Yundai 62256) connects. 
<br />
<br />Normally they should connect to MMC1 pins 9 and 10 (CHR A15 and A16) respectively, but I never had any confirmation on this. It's impossible to see where they connect with only the pictures, but if you have an ohm-meter and could veryfiy that it would be great.
<br />
<br />Also, pin 6 of MMC1 (CE) should connect to pin 1 of the 'HCU04 and pin 2 of the 'HCU04 to pin 20 (/CE) of the SRAM. Pin 22 (/OE) should be connected to GND. Then all other pins of the HCU04 would be connected to nothing signigicant, as this chip probably only serves to invert the CE signal.
<br />
<br />If you could possibly veryfy all of that, it would be  awesome, and confirm all our hypotesis about the SXROM board.

<br />
<br />You're in luck: I do have a ohm meter since I bought one back recently because I need it to built my dev carts soon. Good chance I will be asking many questions about it since my attempt may (actually will) fail on my first try -_-;; 
<br />
<br />Good thing I didn't close the cart before reading that post.  I will check it right away and see what I can do.  I'm a little bit exhausted thought, so I hope I won't do any mistake <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/front_pcb2.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />[SRAM]
<br />- Pin 1 of SRAM do connect to pin 10 of MMC1
<br />- Pin 26 of SRAM do not connect to pin 9 of MMC1. It seems to connect to the same pins as 30th of PRG and one pin on connector
<br />- Pin 17 of SRAM connects to pin 9 of MMC1
<br />- Pin 20 of SRAM is useless info. I made mistake with 22
<br />- pin 22 of SRAM connects to the same pings as 26 of PRG, which connect to back of the 3rd connector's pin from the left. I don't know if this mean /CE since I don't have any electronic background. Please confirm.
<br />
<br />[HCU04]
<br />- Pin 1 of HCU04 do connect to pin 6 of MMC1
<br />- Pin 2 of HCU04 do not connect to pin 20 of SRAM. It connects to the 23rd one.
<br />- All other pins of HCU04 do not connect to anything particular
<br />
<br />This is what I have for now.  I'm no expert and I can do more test if I'm guided in the right direction.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh, pintouts for the chips are numbered counter clockwise. When you reach the second half of a DIP chip, you continue to cout pins in the other direction, you don't get back to the bottom to count up on the other side. Sorry I haven't mentionned that, I was under the impression you knowned that.
<br />
<br />It seems that SRAM pin 28 (that you labelled 17) actually connects to pin 9 of MMC1, which means the full 32kb of SRAM is adressable as it was previously expected. This is good news.

<br />
<br />I just retested everything and here's the updated results:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/front_pcb3.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />[SRAM]
<br />- Pin 1 of SRAM do connect to pin 10 of MMC1
<br />- Pin 26 of SRAM do connect to pin 9 of MMC1
<br />- pin 22 of SRAM connects to what seems to be GND
<br />
<br />[HCU04]
<br />- Pin 1 of HCU04 do connect to pin 6 of MMC1
<br />- Pin 2 of HCU04 do connect to pin 20 of SRAM
<br />- All other pins of HCU04 do not connect to anything particular
<br />
<br />So everything seems to be like you expected.  I will leave the cart open for a few days just in case if you still have other questions about it.
<br />
<br />This is a good thing that I did that. Without this, I would have made quite a mess with the pin order while doing my dev cart -_-;;
<br />
<br />Off topic, did people in the past asked about the meaning of VCC, CE etc? I would love to know more about that. I will do a quick search in the forum, maybe it's there.
