<br />Exactly.
<br />Making any profit would be disrespectful twoards the people that taught you, for free, how to do it (come on, nobody guessed how to rewire EPROMs in a cart just by themselves), and twoards DeJap who translated the game for free.

<br />If everybody who wants a modified cartridge would build it by themselves nobody would buy one, so there must be a market.
<br />
<br />So RetroUSB shouldnt charge for Star Ocean too?
<br />
<br />I mean, they sure dont have the right to use the Dejap translation or the Star Ocean ROM. 
<br />
<br />Since they dont need an original cartridge or need to modify it and just have some streamlined assembling process they may spend less time per cartridge and make more money. Of course they created the cartridge layout, but I guess you can find that on the internet too.

Just because the "time" is less doesn't mean anymore than they can make more in less time. They have to produce the PCBs, Plastic Cases, purchase components, and assemble all that. If you are just hacking old game carts the costs to make it can be far less since you don't need to produce the PCB or Plastic Case, and can reuse some components. 
<br />
<br />But you are absolutely right that no one has any right to be making reproductions of the Star Ocean game and selling them. The Dejap translation I'm not sure they would appreciate indirect profiting off their freely available translation either. But things being illegal doesn't stop them from happening.

<br />Very directly in fact.
<br />The "labor" of programming an eprom and solder a couple of wires is nothing compared to the labor to translate thousands of lines of text and reinsert it in an existing ROM without altering other game data which would cause bugs.
<br />
<br />I don't guess why some people accept to do 98% of the labor for free and some badass does 2% of the labor (assembling the cart from an existing one) and make major profit on it.

<br />
<br />Not that I'm supporting any of this, but I think the reason people accept it is they simply want the cart.  I, they, and you realize there are other options than a repro/hacked cart.  But at the end of the day they want a hard copy  so they accept the only real way to get it regardless of who makes money off of who.  The person who did all the coding work rarely cares to manufacture carts but the badass will. 
<br />
<br />People want what they want regardless of what other people think generally speaking, especially if the other people aren't directly impacted...
