How exactly would you define the MMC5 in magic mapper file terms? Are we supposed to emulate the NES on a circuit level now or something?

This is not really related except it shows at least one way which it can worked.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I never wrote an emulator before, but if I were to write one I imagine I would try the approach of emulating everything cycle by cycle and interfacing with the &quot;cart&quot; through the signals that are actually present on the cartridge connector. That way mappers would be able to do anything they wanted with the signals and respond accordingly. I know this is not very efficient, but current computers should be able to handle that, right?

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Write an emulator and I think you'll find the idea of adding on some mapper file emulator unappealing. It would be horribly inefficient. There are an infinite number of configurations mappers could have. Look at all the pirate multi-cart mappers. The Mapper #90 used by all sorts of weird pirates. MMC2's CHR behavior. Konami VRC's cpu based scanline counter. Other various scanline counters. Awhile ago someone was proposing mapper hardware to try to detect when DMC interferes with reading joypads. And ofcourse look at MMC5 which still probably isn't fully understand from the hardware level. <br /><br />Good luck with your format project.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I don't have a format project at all, I was just saying that it would be really cool if the mappers could easily be bundled with the ROMs, much like happens with real cartridges. I know that this wouldn't be easy, though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I didn't mean you as far as this project. While I agree that it would be cool, I just don't think it is feasible. <br /><br />Game projects, like yours, don't necessarily need any crazy new mappers. I'm pretty happy to see InfiniteNesLives getting these new MMC3 compatible boards ready. Just look at all the great NES games that just use discrete logic, then put MMC3 games on top of that and you have most of the library. So homebrew creations now have plenty of options open to them.
