Spotted one mistake though:<br />He says in his presentation that the NTSC resolution is 256x224, which is incorrect as just discussed in another thread. Both NTSC and PAL PPUs always outputs the full 256x240 resolution.

I think he was confusing sprite patterns with background patterns at one point - easy mistake to do on a stage/in the heat of the moment. <br /><br />Needing to preposition 0x for every byte looks very hard to read. I'd just type 0-255 if that'd work.

Well I guess you'll be quickly limited though ...</div><br /><br />I guess I can see any number of these languages as being potentially a powerful preprocessor for assembly, that's basically what these things are I suppose. What's really interesting to me is observing which approaches actually become commonplace in the community. It seems like most of the high-level experiments with python, lisp, js, etc. remain mostly curiosities or only used by one or two people. Much like I might write a set of ca65 macros specific to how I do things that nobody else would want to use...<br /><br />It seems that one so frequently must understand the low level details anyway that it is hard to imagine one of these high-level preprocessors providing enough more benefit than say CA65 macros that it would be worth abandoning current development tools.

He did repeat the incorrect &quot;NTSC has only 224 pixels&quot; line that I've seen many times.

As long as your functions are already programmed, code can be re-used this way, isn't it ?

But it looks like you have to write more asm to extend the functionality, so its usefulness as a high-level solution is limited.
