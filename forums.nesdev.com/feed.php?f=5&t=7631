No I meant an IC socket soldering to the PCB so the user could simply remove an expired serial eeprom or similar eeprom chip when it runs out of write/erase cycles. A bunch of games saving to SD cards put into their own cartridges would be strange unless you actually needed to save some huge amount of data.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Sat Apr 09, 2011 9:54 am</p><hr />

8k saves seems to be the standard for NES, SNES and PS1 games.<br /><br />Systems that uses EEPROM or Flash based saves seems to usually save on a different chip than the one the game is programmed on.

One use I can think of for banked SRAM is to use the banks for different subsystems. One bank could be reserved for your map and objects, another for the sound engine (to store uncompressed music and SFX data), a third for your battle system (for a JRPG) or your menu system or other user interface stuff, and the fourth for save files.<br /><br />With 8K reserved for save files I can think of a lot of cool things you could do. You could allow every map to remember a lot about it's state. You could keep a running counter of how many of each type of enemy has been defeated. Or you could just allow the user to have 16 save slots, each with a double backup <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Also, passwords = the stuff you scrape off your shoe after walking 20 dogs in the park  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3706">qbradq</a> — Fri Apr 08, 2011 5:31 am</p><hr />

You can use ROM, But that'd only be good for things that aren't updated every frame, more like 10 times a play or something small. Because if it saves AND uses the SRAM at the same time, the Flash would be pretty much useless and overkill. IMO, just sticking to the SRAM+Battery is better since it can double as a RAM. That's kinda the whole point of the RAM I'd think.<br /><br /><br />Although, it'd be interesting to see a FlashROM in a cart too. Or do as I think was said some time ago, use s serial flash ROM and make a "memory card" that plugs into the expansion port/controller port and use that. That'd be far better IMO. More games can use it if they wanted, and it'd be cheaper than including a Flash ROM in every cart.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Thu Apr 07, 2011 5:26 pm</p><hr />

There is a chip erase command that will erase the whole chip, but it would be virtually impossible to trigger it accidentally (requiring a sequence of I think 6 writes with specific address/data - same with sector erase command).

Yeah using it would be the same, with the exception that you would reserve part of the PRG-ROM to be used for saved data.  4kB or 8kB might be the smallest amount of ROM you "lose", out of 512kB (or 256kB).<br /><br />I will supply code with it that would verify and copy data between the WRAM and FlashROM.  It would create sort of a simple filesystem, and automatically erase/rewrite the 4kB sectory when it's "full".<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Apr 07, 2011 4:56 pm</p><hr />
