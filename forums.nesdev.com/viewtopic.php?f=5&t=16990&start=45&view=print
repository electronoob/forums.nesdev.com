		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@Garth What frustrates me is that what we're doing seemingly has no basis in reality. Like, what the hell actually is a &quot;String&quot; in data? We're taught all these different &quot;data types&quot;, but one of the first things we even learned in the class is that all data is that all data is represented by &quot;1's and 0's.&quot; I know it's for how the compiler wants to treat the data, but I think most people are a bit confused by it. Just give me the option for &quot;byte,&quot; &quot;word,&quot; &quot;dword,&quot; and &quot;qword.&quot; <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> We have functions like &quot;Math.random()&quot;, but how it actually gets this &quot;random&quot; number is anyone's guess. Most everyone in the class probably believes that it's actually generating a <em>completely</em> random number, which is, way more than likely, impossible.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A type like &quot;String&quot; is a convention that different parts of a program agree to use for a particular block of ones and zeroes. Features in language implementations for enforcing conventions like these, such as &quot;strong typing&quot; and &quot;static typing&quot;,* help prove that a program does not contain certain classes of errors related to inadvertent violation of these conventions.<br /><br />Nowadays, random numbers can be generated by sampling actually random data, such as room noise picked up by a modern desktop, laptop, tablet, or pocket computer's microphone, and mixing it around.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">* Which are not the same.</span>

But sometimes they have a difficulties on doing pretty simplier things, like write texts, do some slideshow, spreadsheets, etc. Abilities that probably will be needed on their future jobs.<br /><br />I think the use of computers should be integrated with the teaching of other subjects, like teach math using a spreadsheet or how to do a good redaction on a word processor.<br /><br />Other than that, I think that not just C, but any programming language probably will help kids to learn a bit of algorithms, wich in the future can help them to think of better solutions for problems, even the ones that are not directly related to programming/EE.
