<br />Seems this sounds more and more like TheFox's hypothesis that other gtk .dlls are getting in the way. Again, I'd recommend you to remove those from the search paths by either renaming them, or moving them to some place you are sure will not be searched by Windows...

<br />
<br />This is going a bit offtopic and would benefit from a split, but I feel the need to say that getting stuck in ".dll hell" is commonplace on Windows and is hardly dependant upon using native compiled code or scripts/JIT compilation. Besides that, you are confusing and mixing up a lot of different things here in one sentence.
<br />
<br />About native code:
<br />Tilificator is written in Python, as it has been a project where I've experimented a lot with quite complex algorithms, and frankly would never have been able to finish it had I used "native code" instead (meaning C/C++ in these days as thankfully few people write their PC applications in asm)
<br />
<br />Besides that, native code gives you the joy of "illegal exceptions" instead, leaving the user without any clues of where to look for answers as to your crashing application. That's more close to having "a hell to figure out what's wrong", if you ask me. :)
<br />
<br />About frameworks:
<br />Tilificator also uses GTK+, as it needed a GUI and GTK+ was the one I was most familliar with. Of course there are alternatives to GTK+, such as Qt, wxWidgets etc, each having their pro's and cons. 
<br />
<br />And no, none of their runtimes will come bundled with a Windows installation, so they all need some sort of thirdparty installation. Besides the fact that the Win32 widget framework is just horrible to use IMHO, I would not want to exclude GNU/Linux users from running my software just to make the experience of Windows users slightly smoother. I hope some non-Windows users will appreciate my choice.
<br />
<br />About plugins:
<br />Windows uses .dlls, so naturally it is the most natural way to use above said frameworks on Windows. And frankly I must say that for all the bashing that GNU/Linux usually gets, the package management there is really superior to .dll hell on Windows. 
<br />
<br />That said, my home computer which Tilificator is currently being developed on uses Windows 7, so I am surprised to see the difficulties people are facing, and am trying to investigate the reaons. But unconstructive picking on my choice of development tools isn't really helping much.

<br />Tkinter, the Python interface to Tcl/Tk, comes bundled with every copy of Python for Windows. IDLE uses it, and 8name II (a nametable editor that I wrote in late 2009) uses it. You could probably get away with just making a tool depend on Python, Tkinter, and PIL, which a Windows user can install with two EXEs and an Ubuntu user can install with <strong>sudo apt-get install python-imaging-tk</strong>.

<br />
<br />And don't worry it's not the first time I have issues with tools running on my PC ! A lot of stuff is problematic, sometimes I even have to use DoxBox or Wine (form linux) to run tools that are supposed to work in Windows.
<br />
<br />My Windows 7 has been installed 2 years and a half ago (when it came out) and not it's basically a huge mess and very slow Windows I have, and I should definitely back up and format to get PC for a second youth.
<br />However, I never wants to do it right away because I'm lazy and I have some *ahem* programs I got from *ahem* odd ways and I'm afraid of loosing them completely if I format my drive.
<br />
<br />I don't think Baramos is to blame for using libraries, in fact I guess his tools use complex logic (it's not something simple like a hex to .db converter or something in the like like the tools I'm able to develop on my own), so obviously he has to use some libraries.
<br />I remember getting trouble getting other similarly complex tools like the drum to while noise converter, the NES image converter and other things, to run.

<br />
<br />In theory things should be much simpler in GNU/Linux, since the package manager should fix everything for you if you just find the package for PyGTK and PIL. In practice... I haven't tried Tilificator on a Linux system in quite a while, so can't gurantee it'll work well. But hey, that's what beta testers are for, right? ;)
<br />
<br />I also had a try with <a href="http://www.py2exe.org/" class="postlink">py2exe</a> to produce a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tilificator/files/releases/tilificator_v0.2C02-win32.zip/download" class="postlink">win32 native build with all .dlls included</a> which you could also try out, but I don't know if it'll be any more successful at solving the .dll hell...
<br />
<br />(btw, are you using 32-bit or 64-bit Windows?...)

<br />
<br />In order for the automatic locating of sprites in the sprite sheet to work, the background should be color#0 (the image needs to be 8-bit indexed color format), and it must be possible to find a blank line between each row of sprites in the sheet.
<br />
<br />If it's possible for you to share the sprite sheet in question, I can look into it.

<br />Personally I don't think the DLL hell is all that bad. Or it wouldn't be if authors always distributed their applications with all the necessary DLLs. There's really no excuse to not be doing that nowadays (unless the application is being distributed as source code, like in your case). The actual issues behind errors like seen by Bregalad are always very simple, I'm still willing to be that older copies of the same DLLs were "somewhere". Unfortunately Windows doesn't make it easy by default to diagnose these problems...
<br />
<br />The package management systems of *nix distros are fine until you need to install something more specialized, and then the dependency hell often becomes even worse than on Windows.
<br />
<br />That's my 5 cents on derailing the thread. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry for not noticing your PM until now, I usually only login if I need to write in a thread.
<br />
<br />Like I suspected, your spritesheet does not use color#0 for the background, and this triggered a bug in the cut spritesheet dialog where it would use the color of the upper-left pixel of the sheet as the background color in some of its code, but still assume color#0 to be the background code in another routine.
<br />
<br />I've fixed that bug in the SVN source repository, so your sprite sheet now loads. But I kind of doubt the result is what you wanted: the composite sprite window on the write will end up showing gray rectangles around the characters, while the black contours will end up as transparent.
<br />
<br />Instead, I think what you want to do is remap the colors and switch color#0  with color#3, so that the gray bg will be color#0 and the black contours will be color#3. I easily did this with the "Rearrange Colormap" menu in GIMP. If this is not what you want, please try to explain what you would expect Tilificator to do here.
<br />
<br />With the 'ShiftedRows' method, your spritesheet ends up using 90 tiles. I could also reduce this to 89 tiles by noticing some suboptimal tiling (a result of the order of images and the lack of global optimization mentioned earlier) and deleting some tiles manually and running a second pass, forcing it to use another, similar instead. I also noticed at least two tiles which differed only in the color of one pixel.
<br />
<br />With the 'DragQueen' method, I got 90 tiles at well, although the results look very different since that method squezees the tiles together as much as possible (which may be considered an advantage when doing OAM cycling, since less total pixels will flicker). 
<br />
<br />However, it also seemed to produce a worthless completely blank sprite/tile! I need to look into this.
<br /><strong>EDIT: This bug in now fixed in the SVN source repository.</strong>
<br />
<br />
<br />Anyways, that mans 89 tiles for that spritesheet should really be the result without manual tweaking. Does that satisfy your tile budget? :)
