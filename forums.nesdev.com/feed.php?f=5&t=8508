Of course, in the early days of Windows Vista, Microsoft had to make that hard. Virtual PC wouldn't run on the home editions, and the original EULA of the home editions banned running them inside a virtual machine. I'll say Windows is secure once it makes it point-and-click easy to set up a jail for a single desktop application. But Microsoft appears to want to go in a different direction in Windows 8 with the Metro Style apps, analogous to the model for Xbox Live Indie Games and the iOS Developer Program, where each developer has to pay Microsoft an annual fee to run his own code on his own computer.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Jan 13, 2012 5:48 am</p><hr />

Need to install a program you'll only use once (to convert a file or something)? Use the sand box or a virtual machine, and don't pollute your OS with any of the program's crap. Visiting porn sites? Sand box or virtual machine. Afraid that the keygen for some software you stole is infected? Sand box or virtual machine. That's always the answer... Only use the real machine for things that are tested and known to be safe and necessary.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Jan 12, 2012 8:05 pm</p><hr />

Consoles were certainly better gaming devices than IBM PC compatibles before the early to mid 90s, considering before there were <strong>no graphical acceleration options available for them at all</strong>. Plus DOS was basically a bad 8086 port of CP/M, the Japanese did far better computers based on the x86 architecture <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lefHUdcniuE&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lefHUdcn ... re=related</a><!-- m --> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1thWKQEDcI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1thWKQEDcI</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Presently, well, compare the gaming capabilities of a say Xbox 360 or PS3 to same priced PCs. Ridiculous PC fanboys always compare their 4000 dollar PCs to consoles. Compare a 140-250 dollar PC (same price as the non-S Xbox 360 now) to a 140-250 dollar Xbox 360 and you'll see what I mean. <br /><br />Hell, I've encountered 2 Ghz computers - that barely run Warcraft 3 in 800x600 due to an "integrated" Intel graphics card (basically reducing a 2 Ghz computer to a 500 Mhz Pentium II). Call of Duty 1 lagged on those and they were ridiculously virus infected. Warcraft 3 run on my 1 Ghz Celeron machine I had half a decade ago perfectly, in high details and resolution.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5110">Beeper</a> — Thu Jan 12, 2012 2:57 am</p><hr />

There's no such thing as a generic PC, so their arguments are unfalsifiable and kind of pointless.   <br />  <br />Maybe it's partly because PC-only gamers have little to argue or compare about with their equipment, except maybe graphics cards, so they just say "the PC will beat any of those any day".<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5131">Primitive</a> — Wed Jan 11, 2012 5:53 pm</p><hr />

I think comparing NES to the 80s IBM PC is fair, considering early PC was supposed to be so much more powerful but yet it sucked. And C64 games beat most PC games well into the 286 era. Still, graphics amd CPU speed are much higher on the NES than the C64 so the NES wins this contest as well.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5110">Beeper</a> — Mon Jan 09, 2012 11:56 pm</p><hr />

I think comparing the NES to the C64 would be more fitting.<br /><br />But seeing as how the C64 is basically a console with a keyboard and some IO chips added. <br /><br />I know the Amiga was originally suppose to be a game console too, but again, commodore turned it into a computer...<br /><br />Didn't the C64 start out as a game machine, but commodore ended up making it a computer?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=45">drk421</a> — Mon Jan 09, 2012 9:13 pm</p><hr />

Did they completely skip this generation ?<br /><br />I remember I also had my dad's old 486 PC up to year 2003 or so. Good old times... (or not). You bet I played very old games with it, and the only emulator fast enough for it was Nesticle.<br /></div><br /><br />I wouldn't really blame communism that much. The situation here (from what I know from older people around me) was not like in 1980s Poland, Romania or USSR where the foreign currency deficit crisis hit the hardest. The people who came immediatly after it were much worse. For what I know from people older than me the 90s were a lot worse than the 80s. There was some gaming in the 80s too, mostly on ZX Spectrum (we had a ZX clone called Didaktik with 80 KB RAM but some people had the original ZX too), Atari XL and C64. Not many people had it through, imports were hard to get and domestic Didaktik computers were in demand by schools and other organizations. Almost everybody learned some IT at school (and of course they played games when the teacher was not paying attention or allowed them). There were also PMD-85 computers that almost every school had and was basically like ZX Spectrum, but monochrome (well, 4 colors really but most software was done in monochrome as color TVs were not much available) and using an Intel 8080 clone instead of Z80 (TESLA MHB 8080).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5110">Beeper</a> — Mon Jan 09, 2012 12:07 pm</p><hr />
