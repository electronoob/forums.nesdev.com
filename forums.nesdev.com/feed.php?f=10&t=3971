Well I have a multi-directional scrolling platformer with RPG aspects, so slow-down is really possible. I guess it wouldn't be so bad if it slowed down to 30 FPS, but I wouldn't want this to happen often...<br /><br />I agree about the stack idea. It would eventually overflow, which would be really bad. It was just an idea though.<br /><br />The bottom line is <em>every</em> requested PPU/APU update has to happen one way or another. You <em>cannot</em> skip any updates, otherwise really really bad things could happen. So in order to be certain that all of these updates have happened, it seems the game loop cannot be executed again until all of the necessary information has been copied over, thus meaning at the end of a game loop, one must wait for the next NMI to copy the PPU/APU data, which forces the game loop to take an integer number of frames.<br /><br />Now that I think about it, how would double-buffering be implemented for a game loop? Wouldn't that only apply if the game loop was shorter than a frame, and not longer?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat Mar 21, 2009 11:15 am</p><hr />

I really hate digging up this old thread, especially considering that this has been talking about a bunch of times. But I'm still confused about something.<br /><br />Do most games force a software frame to take an integer number of hardware frames? So a game frame will either take 1 or 2 hardware frames, not like 1.5? It seems like this would be the only way to go, because you never want the game loop to be executed unless all of the necessary PPU and audio data has been copied, which can only really happen at the start of a frame. If that were the case, then how do (if any do) games manage to slow the frame rate down to anything other than 30, 20, 15, 12, etc. FPS?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Fri Mar 20, 2009 7:12 pm</p><hr />

In the case of the title screen delay, the current state is "waiting for the counter to reach 0", the circunstance is the value of the counter, and the action it takes is either "decrement the counter" (in case it hasn't reached 0) or "fade out the screen and move along" (in case it did reach 0).

Wait a minute... "delays"? What do you mean by "delays"? I hope you don't mean a loop that just wastes time in order for something to remain on the screen for a while... because that's just terrible.<br /><br />It's terrible because you end up delaying EVERYTHING. A proper delay system should be defined in terms of frames, and variables in RAM would act as counters. If you decrement these variables once everyframe, ideally in your NMI routine, when they reach zero you know the delay is over. This allows you to delay diferent parts of your program independently if you want to.<br /><br />For example, if you have an enemy walking left, but then he stops moving for a while, before turning around and moving right. You'll sure not want the whole game to stop (possibly even the music) just because the enemy needed to remain stopped for a while.<br /><br />About the PPU updates, you can only do it when the scren is not rendering, regardless of whether you're doing it inside the NMI routine or not.<br /><br />The most common cases have already been explored:<br /><br />1. Whole game inside the NMI routine;<br />2. Whole game in the main program;<br />3. Game logic in the main program, PPU updates inside NMI routine;<br /><br />All of them work fine, but one might be better then the other for a particular project, and only the programmer can decide that.<br /><br />Number 1 can be a bit confusing, because every VBlank you update the PPU with data calculated during the last frame, and then calculate the data for the next one. Number 2 works works fine too, when you use the NMI to set a flag to indicate that VBlank started. Neither 1 or 2 handle slowdowns very well, because you either can't tell you missed a frame, or you can only tell a while after it happened. So you better make sure your frame calculations fit whithin a frame's time at least 99% of the time.<br /><br />With number 3 you can split the work, in a way that a piece of it can take as long as necessary, while the other will run once every frame for sure. This makes it easy to take care of things that need critical timing, such as music.<br /><br />Frankly, if you game logic is pretty fast, it doesn't matter at all what method you choose. The problem is mostly how to handle slowdowns.<br /><br />There are a few rare cases when a game could seriously benefit from the 3rd method. when I was first thinking about making a raycaster, I knew I'd have a lot of things to calculate. So, once there was enough data to update the PPU, instead of waiting fo VBlank doing nothing (methods 1 and 2) the data for the next frame could already be calculated, so chances were frames would be ready faster. In some cases it is necessary to keep the main code always busy, while the NMI simply updates the PPU with whatever data is ready at the time it fires.<br /><br />Again, this is the case of more complex programs, where a software frame is not necessarily aligned to a single hardware frame.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Mar 23, 2008 10:33 pm</p><hr />

So far i found that a least delays work best in the Main loop and not in the NMI. basically almost everything  in my code is being run in NMI's  but there some slight problems in NMI that run better in the Main.  Like loading a new nametable with little or no gliches and or moving a sprite while one is moving in its own algorithm. Glitchy Glitchy Glitchy.   thats the problem.  if figure flags flags flags but i just havnt envisioned it yet.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=352">nineTENdo</a> — Sun Mar 23, 2008 9:41 pm</p><hr />

Then it's quite simple to do what you describe. You routine that waits until a NMI has passed most certailnly relies on a flag to do so. So in the NMI engine, if you see this flag is in the position where the main programm was waiting, you do all PPU and sprites upadtes before returning, else you only do music and then retrun. I don't handle it that way myself because it disalows any hope to get an update if the main programm does something else than an "official" wait, but if you want to do it that way it's fine. If I remember correctly Mega Man worked a similar manner.<br /><br />If I'm not mistaking you're living in the USA, so that's a free country (at least from what I've heard, and they're even proud of it to a point where they make statues about it), so it should be allright for you do do it the way you want without having anyone torture you or anything.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Mar 18, 2008 9:37 am</p><hr />

All I'm wanting to do is make sure that JUST IN CASE there needs to be any slow down, the game will be able to slow down just a little bit without causing a catastrophe. And I am also wanting the game to mostly run at 60FPS. I'm trying to avoid running at a constant 30FPS, or running at 60FPS and updating garbage on the screen when it takes a little longer than a frame.<br /><br />I have to try and avoid one of these problems, otherwise I'm going to end up with either really annoying slow framerates, or disaster. Neither one is good. <br /><br />I suppose I can just update the PPU data right away after the NMI, and then the rest of the frame would just be object calculations. And thankfully, my sprites' graphics are represented with one byte, so if an NMI were to occur in the middle of me assigning a new graphic to a metasprite, it would show up as one graphic, or another. If it were represented with two bytes, then I'd have some trouble. Because I could update one byte, and the other would remain un-updated while the NMI is called. This could result in really really bad things. I'd have to guarantee pretty much that the PPU data, excluding sprites, would be updated in less than a frame. This is very possible for my platformer.<br /><br />I suppose I see how it can work a little bit. I just don't see how you could update some PPU stuff, and not other PPU stuff. Like if you scroll over, you HAVE to be ready to update the background including the attribute table. And if you're touching sprite coords in relation to the map, you have to set a flag that states you can't scroll over. It gets back to two byte writes. If you update one byte, and not the other while being interrupted by the NMI, your sprite will end up in a place that you're just not wanting it to end up. Although, it would only be for a frame, and people might not even notice it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Mon Mar 17, 2008 11:56 am</p><hr />
