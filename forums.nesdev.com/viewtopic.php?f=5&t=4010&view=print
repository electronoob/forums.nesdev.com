I wouldn't mind the NESDEV people knowing more about me, but this is the fucking WEB, where not everyone is nice, and might end up using what you write against you.
<br />
<br />I really enjoy that the internet makes it possible for us to find people with the same interests. There's no way I'd be into NESDEV at all if it wasn't for this place, and emulation in general, simply because no one I meet in my everyday life would ever show the same interest, I'm pretty sure of that. So I'll give the internet that, but it is indeed a pretty nasty place to give out information about yourself.

<br />Not really, we know your name from your web page... =)
<br />
<br />OK then, I'll give this a shot:
<br />
<br />1. Pretty broad question, but my name is Thiago (equivalent to "James" in english).
<br />2. I was born and live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Just for the record, I hate soccer, carnaval and samba in general. I was born in the wrong country.
<br />3. I got into gaming when the 16-bit consoles were "the shit". Only when emulation kicked in (1997~1998) I fell in love with the simplicity of the NES, and got very interested on how it worked.
<br />4. NES programming, watch anime/read manga, draw (manga), ActionScript 3.0 programming... I'm sure I'm leaving lots of other things out.
<br />5. 26, 3 cats, engaged, no kids.
<br />6. None that I can remember...
<br />7. Finishing Computer Science course at the university, working as WEB developer.
<br />8. Will probably keep working with WEB development, although that brings me no joy.
<br />Religious stance: Agnostic.
