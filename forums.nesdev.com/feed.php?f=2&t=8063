Update:<br /><br />I got so fed up, I dug out my CRT monitor from the garage, hooked the NES up to it and did the same physical measure of the graphics as I did on my LCD TV. Much to my dismay, the measurements of the onscreen graphics exactly matched the ratio of 292x240. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" /> <br /><br />Furthermore, the Wheel of Fortune test I did was wrong. The border wasn't meant to be a perfect circle, but rather the wheel itself was. At 292x240, it works out just fine.   <br /><br />So I give up. My own CRT matched the 292x240 ratio, so I cannot deny that now. My apologies for my previous revelations. I seriously thought I was on to something with the visible aspect concept.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4985">Firebrandx</a> — Sat Aug 27, 2011 11:26 pm</p><hr />

Argh! Just when I thought I had it all figured out, it blows up in my face again!<br /><br />Here's Wheel of Fortune taking into account my idea of using the "visible" aspect ratio based on 256x224:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.firebrandx.com/downloads/neswheel.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Notice the perfect circle? So it would seem they had the same idea I did. You simply go with a 4:3 format based on the middle 224 lines. Unfortunately this goes even more extreme than less extreme. In this case, it comes out to about 299 or 298x240. That's even worse than 292x240!<br /><br />If I'm going to go with "visible" aspect ratio, I'd need to know on average just how much of the 256 is normally displayed on screen. We already know the vertical average is 224, but so far we've been assuming all 256 for horizontal. <br /><br />I'm about ready to give up on this quest to find the truth. It's so frustrating!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4985">Firebrandx</a> — Sat Aug 27, 2011 10:16 pm</p><hr />

Forget 224, that number of scanlines isn't even consistent across TVs.  My 1980 TV displays about 231 scanlines, but the frame of the TV is rounded, so that's only in the middle.<br /><br />Also, CRT TVs tend to distort the image based on the contents of the palette.

I probably should post a new reply since I've gone back and edited my previous reply about a dozen times now to add corrections and new findings.<br /><br />Anyway, because of my epiphany, I now know this part of the wiki article to be flat-out wrong:<br /><br /><em>But as a slight optimization, you can scale first (256 * 8/7 = 292) and then pad: stretch the 256x240 pixels to 292x240, 584x480, 876x720, or 1168x960 square pixels or 320x240 or 640x480 non-square pixels. Then you can emulate the overscan by drawing a TV bezel on top of the edges of the emulated picture. </em><br /><br />It's wrong because it fails to figure in the <strong>VISIBLE</strong> aspect ratio of the NES screen on 4:3 TVs. The visible aspect should be based on 256x224, NOT 256x240. As I said in my updated reply on page 1, this is the same mistake the designers of Wheel of Fortune made. The article then makes it even worse by suggesting a bezel to cover up the top and bottom edges. Too bad it already used that area to factor in VISIBLE aspect ratio! Wrong wrong wrong! You calculate the ratio based on 256x224, and then add on the remaining 16 lines to the top and bottom. Only after that should you consider the option of a bezel.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4985">Firebrandx</a> — Sat Aug 27, 2011 9:22 pm</p><hr />

To clarify, I'm talking about the intended aspect ratio of the 256x240 active pixels. My LCD TV measurements had it at 1.215:1 (based on the 232 visible vertical res, 1.175:1 total for 256x240), which is 282x240 when you resize an emulated NES screen. Coincidentally, my TV had the SNES in exactly the same horizontal sizing (because both NES and SNES both uses 256 active horizontal), and had borders on the top and bottom where the remaining 16 pixels would have been for a 240 vertical res.<br /><br />So to recap:<br /><br />My TV uses 1.215:1 for 256x232 visible (1.175:1 for the full 256x240) and 1.2592:1 for 256x224, both being equal to 282 horizontal correction width in an emulator at lowest scale. <br /><br />Now that 292 width you're talking about is just way too wide. As I pointed out, the only game that seems to use that figure is Wheel of Fortune. Most everything else expects somewhere around 280~282, which is where my own TV has it. Again the 280~282 I'm talking about is when you take 256x240 and resize it horizontally in a paint program to give the appearance of being TV-aspect accurate.<br /><br />Edit: corrected some mistakes in my reply<br /><br />Edit 2: It has now dawned on me the mistake being made about the 292 figure. It assumes all 240 lines are visible onscreen. They are not! On my TV, you have the option of the default 224 visible, or a slightly zoomed out mode of 232 visible (which I use). In both cases, its a mistake to figure in all 240 lines when considering the correct aspect ratio. NTSC TVs only display about 224, so if you shrunk the screen to fit all 240, the aspect ratio becomes changed unless you allow black borders to show up on the sides of the screen. This now makes perfect sense on how the designers of Wheel of Fortune screwed up. They made the mistaken assumption of basing their aspect correction on all 240 lines being visible. This gave them the wrong aspect, and is why it looks so extreme compared to other games.<br /><br />So to conclude, 292x240 is actually wrong. It doesn't take into account NTSC TVs lop off a portion of the NES graphics on the top and bottom.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4985">Firebrandx</a> — Sat Aug 27, 2011 8:28 pm</p><hr />

So you want to turn the NES's wide pixels into square pixels of the same size, and you want to scale before padding. You need to multiply the <em>width</em> by the PAR and leave the <em>height</em> unchanged. This gives (256 * 1.143) = 292 wide by 240 tall.<br /><br />The wiki article assumes that you'll pad before scaling, as that's what actually goes on in the NTSC signal. In this case, you need to find the square-pixel clean aperture (320x240), <em>divide</em> the width by the PAR (producing 280x240), generate the NES picture into that size of a frame, and then scale to 320.<br /><br />So do you want the wiki article to contain specific instruction from an emulator author's point of view for both the pad-before-scaling case and the scale-before-padding case?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Aug 27, 2011 6:01 pm</p><hr />

I spent most of the evening testing various games in the NES library. 280 and 282 seem to be the most common expected ratios. For example, the silver ball in "Pinbot" becomes perfectly round via 280x240, whereas the bumpers in "Pinball" lean more towards 282x240 for perfect roundness.<br /><br />I did find one extreme case in "Wheel of Fortune". I don't know if the programmers expected the wheel to appear perfectly round, but it requires 292x240 to make it that way. It's the most anamorphic design of graphics I've seen yet in an NES game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4985">Firebrandx</a> — Sat Aug 27, 2011 12:17 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />How I know 282 is the most accurate was the cross-verification with emulated Metroid. Seriously, what are the odds that my LCD TV just happens to make the morph ball PERFECTLY circular when applied to emulated Metroid? No other figure makes that happen. Not 280, not 288, not 290, but EXACTLY 282. Furthermore, 282 makes perfect circles no matter what scale multiples you use. 500% was my example, but any scale multiple works. When you try 280, the circles become more and more inaccurate as you test them at higher scales.<br /></div><br /><br /> Dev's BITD tended to just round off the PAR. I've seen it where they <strong>completely</strong> got it wrong. Though this isn't as obvious until you get into the 16bit generation and ports of arcade games. Consumer grade CRT TVs weren't accurately calibrated (they were calibrated within 'range'). But most, if not all, of my TVs I own during the 8 and 16bit era had narrower settings for PAR (NTSC). Same with friends sets. 290, 292, etc just doesn't look right from the years I played these old games. I personally go with a low 280ish number (for 5.369mhz dot clock) in emulation if I have the option. Still beats a straight 1:1 PAR (on a square pixel display). I have to use different scale values for full screen though, as my monitor is square pixel but 5:4 resolution ratio (no 4:3).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3645">tomaitheous</a> — Fri Aug 26, 2011 9:20 pm</p><hr />

After some more tests with various narrow graphics, I have to concede that there is an 'analog' variance level in expected aspect ratio. It seems each game's programmers used whatever analog 4:3 setting their equipment was at during the graphic design process. I went back and examined Dr. Mario more closely, lining up circles down to the single pixel level and concluded it expected a 286 ratio. However, 286 was too wide for Metroid, indicating a different standard was used. The more games I tested, the more I found it varied from game to game.<br /><br />So all this means that for NES artwork, there is no specific standard ratio you can go by. Instead, we're back to an analog knob adjutsment, though I feel the range can be tightened down to say 280 to 288 to allow room for error. I wasn't able to find any game examples outside of this range.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4985">Firebrandx</a> — Fri Aug 26, 2011 5:30 pm</p><hr />

The NES PPU line period is 341 pixels. The standard NTSC line period is 341.25 NES pixels. But as I view it, the length of the active picture portion is what matters.<br /><br />The magnifying glass size is less than a pixel off, and as I said, it's a case of round-to-nearest-tile anyway.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Aug 26, 2011 3:36 pm</p><hr />
