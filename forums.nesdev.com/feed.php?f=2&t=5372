Each attribute byte affects an area of 32x32 pixels (except for the last row, which affects 32x16-pixel areas), which would be 4 "standard" metatiles (each one has the palette selected by 2 bits). So if you meant that 4 metatiles (or an equivalent area) changed colors, that's supposed to happen. In fact, this is the reason I suggested you update the attributes every 32 scrolled pixels while scanning 2 columns of metatiles. If you mean something else though, something really wrong is going on...!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Jul 07, 2009 4:47 am</p><hr />

Here I explain.  Once I wrote 2 columns of tiles, column 0 and 1 in inc32 mode.  Before writing a column, I set the address ($2000) then write the column. The set the second address ($2001) for column 1 and write the column of tiles. <br /><br />After writing the second column, I decided to test the attributes right away, to write 1 byte to see what happens. For some reason, I forgot to set the address for the attribute table to $23C0 and wrote right away 1 attribute for testing. After the write,  that 1 byte write updated 4 attributes.<br /><br />But now since I still have some bugs in my code, it could be just a coding error  BUT... when I set the address before writing to the attribute table for this test, the behavior was gone. hmm....<br /><br />I will try to reproduce that behavior again if I have a chance.  I want to know why the attribute was written 4 time, make sure that it's a real behavior or not.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Tue Jul 07, 2009 3:59 am</p><hr />

I see. So the increment 32 methods seems interesting then. I write 2 column of metatiles so on the first column, I want to update the attributes. I will see if I can test it tonight.<br /><br />One behavior I saw while testing how attributes works, when I was in column mode, after the second column of tiles, if I wrote in the attributes 1 byte, it wrote 4 for some reason.

Although you can in fact take advantage of the "increment 32" feature. Attribute rows are 8 bytes long, which means that by incrementing 32 you skip 4 rows. Since there are 8 rows, it's possible to write to the whole column updating the address only 4 times instead of 8. It works like this: set address, write to rows 0 and 4; add 8 to address and set it; write to rows 1 and 5; add 8 to address ans set it; write to rows 2 and 6; add 8 to address and set it; write to rows 3 and 7.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Is there any easier way that I may have miss?<br /></div><br />I don't think so. Attributes are a pain to work with, sometimes more sometimes less, depending on the size of your metatiles or the type of scrolling in use.<br /><br />If you only scroll horizontally, which I believe is your case, I suggest you update the attributes every 32 scrolled pixels, much like metatiles are updated every 16 scrolled pixels. Just scan across both metatile columns forming the 8 attribute bytes you'll need. This would be a fairly constant process, without many branches or special cases.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Jul 06, 2009 3:58 am</p><hr />

Let's say I have a map that uses 2x2 metatiles.  I write on the screen in column mode my metatile columns. When I finish to write my first column of metatile, I want to update the attribute tables.  Now I'm not sure how to approach it.<br /><br />I don't think that staying in column mode would help because it skips 32 bytes per write and I think I need to revert to normal mode for the address increment.  But since I'm writing column of data, this mean that for every attribute write I must increment the address pointer (by 8 bytes) to the next attribute?  If this is the case, this mean I have to keep a copy of the address and increment it put it back in the controller for every write? That's my guess and will try it tonight but I don't know if there is any other way.  This way it just seems a lot of processing for the attribute (that you already had to put back together from your metatile color attributes) compared to just writing the metatile.  Is there any easier way that I may have miss?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Mon Jul 06, 2009 2:58 am</p><hr />
