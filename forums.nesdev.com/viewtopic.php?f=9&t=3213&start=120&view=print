<br />I agree.  The red is very appealing! Perhaps, at some point, we will see a gold Zelda style shell for the pak. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />Patents expire 20 years after filing. Design patents expire sooner.

<br />
<br />It took many mods but I verified PowerPak works fine on PAL systems, tested using Mattel Version.  The top or bottom row is corrupted while scrolling through file listings so I may fix that.  Didnt notice any irq problems, SMB3 works good.
<br />
<br />To get the AUS system working I had to:
<br />1.  solder new power plug
<br />2.  disable lockout (no ciclones yet)
<br />3.  add pullups to controller
<br />4.  get pal-&gt;ntsc converter
<br />5.  use slingbox because no other tvs would find the ntsc signal
<br />6.  play in 1950s mode because only the b/w part was picked up  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />7.  cope with ~5 sec delay for slingbox to compress

<br />
<br />That looks like directories and long file names.  What, exactly, is the file system support?  FAT16 with standard long file name support, or does the PowerPak support some non-standard long file name extension?

Microdrives would also likely work assuming they didn't drain too much power or are too big physically.
<br />
<br />Only the first logical partition on the CF card is used.  The root dir of that partition is shown first.  The folder holding all the mappers must be in the root dir (POWERPAK dir in movie), everything else you can arrange how you want.

<br />Darn, that shoots to pieces my plans to use the same CF card with a GBA Movie Player (PocketNES) and the PowerPak (TheRealThingNES). But anyway, how is FAT16 more of a mess than FAT32?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />FAT16 has variable cluster sizes for volumes in the cf card range, and root dir is "special" and can hold only a small number of files.  There are more variations of the FAT16 headers depending on which OS formats the disk, Win95 and XP do two completely different things.  Also wastes more space when your drive is 512MB+, tho that isn't really a concern.
<br />
<br />Random GBA Movie Player website (<a href="http://www.gbamovie.com/ztt.htm" class="postlink">http://www.gbamovie.com/ztt.htm</a>) says it does FAT32, is that wrong or a different product?
