		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes it's possible. It can point to anywhere from $0000 to $FFFF. As long as the CPU can read valid instructions, it'll keep working.
<br />
<br />Programs that copy code to RAM and execute it there are common. This is often done because of self-modifying code (code that modifies itself as necessary, something done for speed) or to have a piece of code available regardless of the PRG-ROM banks that are selected.
<br />
<br />The program will probably crash if the CPU tries to execute the PPU registers for example (because the returned values are not meaningful logic, and possibly contains illegal instructions and reads, writes and jumps to unknown locations), but it will certainly try if you jump there.

<br />
<br />Now I came to think of some more questions.
<br />1. What happens if you read from write only memory(I think some registers are), or from memory that doesn't exist, like 6000-7fff if there's no sram. Is any value returned at all, or is the contents of the destination unchanged?
<br />
<br />2. how do I know if sram exists? the .nes file doesn't say anything about it.

For <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES" class="postlink">iNES</a> ROMs (the majority of dumps in the wild), assume 8 KiB, unless it's on a mapper that can take more. This applies even on a mapper that ordinarily can't take any, such as the discrete mappers, in which case it'd be decoded with a circuit like <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PRG_RAM_circuit" class="postlink">this</a>. A couple games such as Low G Man rely on the presence of open bus at $6000-$7FFF. Such games can't be represented properly in iNES format, and you may need to detect these by comparing the MD5 of the last bank of PRG to values for known problem games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just to elaborate on what Bregalad said, in case you do not have much knowledge of electronics:
<br />
<br />To access memory you need a bus, which is a what connects the different chips. In order to read a value from memory, the CPU send to the memory chip the address it wants to read through the address bus. Then it waits for the value to show up on the data bus, which will be what the memory chip outputs.
<br />
<br />If there is no memory chip at the address in question, the CPU will still put the address on the address bus, but since there is no memory chip to respond, it will just read back what was in the data bus previously, which is usually the last byte of the instruction it's running (since the CPU uses the address and data buses to read the instructions themselves before running them).

<br />Yes that is the case.
<br />Is it necessary to have knowledge of electronics when you write an emulator? If so, are there any good documents to get some basics?

<br />Not really. It will help you understand some things that at first don't make any sense (like this open bus thing), but it's not an absolute necessity. I don't know much about electronics myself, but I ended up learning a few things from working with the NES (although I like to make NES programs, not emulators, but either way you should learn something).
<br />
<br />I don't have any links to recommend, but if you want to read about the subject search, Google for things like "introduction to digital electronics" and "introduction to computer architecture". These should give you a good idea of how things work on the logical side, without being too specific about the electronics stuff.

<br />Well programmed games don't assume anything and will safely initialize everything they use, but there are some things known about the startup sate of the NES.
<br />
<br />Memory is not explicitly cleared, but it isn't very chaotic either, so it's mostly 0's. No game should count on it though, so do whatever you want with it. I believe most emulators clear it all to 0's. <strong>EDIT: Apparently it's $FF and not $00, my mistake!</strong>
<br />
<br />I believe that the CPU and PPU registers have a somewhat consistent startup state, maybe someone else can point you to a document with that information, but games shouldn't rely on that either.
<br />
<br />My opinion is that the startup state is not very important, as I can't think of a single game that relies on that kind of thing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In fact the memory is mostly cleaned with FFs, but some bits are randomly cleared here and there. Also I'm not sure but I think some bits will randomly be clear - but it will always be the same for the same RAM chip (for the NES). This also applies to nametable RAM, CHR-RAM, etc...
<br />So the "most accurate" is to init everything with FFs, but developers shouldn't rely on this.
<br />
<br />I don't know if you need knownledge in electronics to write an emulator, but if you want to code a very accurate emulator you'll probably needs some knownledge.

<br />- A lot of demos don't work because they expect RAM to be 00h instead of FFh. It includes the open-bus for 6000-7FFF, among others.

<br />What demos? Do they work on real consoles?
<br />
<br />No program should ever rely on uninitialized RAM... Unless the programmer is trying to seed a random number generator or something like that, but uninitialized RAM is not such a good source of random numbers either.
<br />
<br />If these demos do rely on uninitialized memory they deserve to not run. A good emulator behaves like the original console, and using hacks to support programs that don't run on a real console goes against that.
