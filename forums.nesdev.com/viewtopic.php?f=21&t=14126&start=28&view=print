		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Not iso, but a thematically concistent excercise in ending/credits/intro screens.  Redrawn work layered over a dithered bw photo in photoshop. Had an extra layer highlighting the first pixel in every 8x8 which helped a lot when deciding how to redraw and what to remove, shift around, and simplify. Then removed the original dither layer and imported in nesst for attributing and tile reuse where needed. The source photo is over 100 years old. It took a few passes before i got it distinct without loosing the horror / old school black metal album cover feel. I thought i might aswell share it and see what you think of it. It is using up a full $FF bytes but could be simplified if needed.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Feels like a late-EGA title screen. Not in the bad way. I like it.<br /><br />And if you parallax that into the background of a level/segment, it'd be lovely. But you're not likely to have a side-scrolling bit where parallax is easy...unless you allow &quot;diagonal&quot; movement w/r/t the grid.<br /><br />Reminds me of the two controlstyles of SR'n'R...

I really like your work, but that style of NES graphics doesn't look good to me.<br /><br />I'd prefer to see it primarily in solid shading with some dithering details.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I actually agree with all these points, for the same reasons and some more.<br /><br />It is very EGA like, and it is not often i liked that style myself. I was aiming for something that was reminiscent of the low budget covers of early black metal albums, but in a video game context,  that translates into something else. <br /><br />Another bad thing with overdithering like this is that it consumes a *lot* of tiles. I used a full $FF of tiles and still felt i had to compromise for the sake of keeping the dithering style concistent (the larger clouds, especially). It was made to be decoration for a club/vernissage evening together with some other stuff displayed on one tv sreen each. But if i'd reuse it for a game, i think it needs to be more clear-cut, both in terms of style and memory usage. That way it would also look more elaborate and perhaps rewarding for the player.
