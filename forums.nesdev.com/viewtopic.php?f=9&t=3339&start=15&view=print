It's up to you to design such projects if you feel like you have the knownledge to, but most of us don't, because personally I have no clue how CD readers works (exepts for the very basics) and I can listen all my CDs trough my stereo, so I don't want to use my NES for this, I'd use it to play games instead. That's just my personal troughts.

<br />
<br />But, on the NES controller port you've got one input and one output that you can use for anything.  If it's asynchronous (like RS232) you might not need anything else, though you'd have to time the code which makes it tricky to do anything else at the same time.  You probably would need a PIC or something else, otherwise.

<br />
<br />Maybe the data going to the DAC could be tapped into and redirected to the PIC on Squeedo (I left an expansion connector with 4 I/Os for such crazy things).  Then one could get the 7-bit sound through an IRQ like my sound synth, no system modifications needed, heheh.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />the serial line on the players controller is serial..  it is RS232 infact, as I tried it on my laptop via HyperTerminal..  When I turn it on, it reports like this, but it seems to be ASCII only,  and only an output, not an input..

<br />that's pretty much how it reports..  I think i could use that, to have the NES reformat it into something it can use..  but trying to press physical buttons, im gonna need a parallel interface i think, as that serial line contains no audio, and is purely status output..

<br />
<br />You can definitely read the input if the baud rate isn't something insanely high like 115.2k.  Then that leaves the CLK line and data output line (probably best to use the data output as an enable for CLK counting, since it would clock on reads too).
<br />
<br />That still leaves the problem of putting the info on screen and polling the RS232 at the same time.. kind of a mess really.  Much easier to do with a UART available.

<br />
<br />the baud rate of it was 1200 baud, so i'd say it's very do-able..  though, programming it i can guess will be pretty bad..

<br />no, not 12v...
<br />
<br />it's a low voltage port..  RS-232 does define 3v as a valid voltage (though minimum)
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />"The RS-232 standard defines the voltage levels that correspond to logical one and logical zero levels. Valid signals are plus or minus 3 to 15 volts."

<br />
<br />this shouldn't be surprising..  many old digital cameras had only 2 AA batteries and yet did RS232..  even my old Cybiko communicated ONLY to the computer by RS232, and it had two 1.2v batteries...

<br />why would I hoax a CD players chip?  lol  im done hoaxing..  im already trying to regain my trust (and i know that will take a VERY long time)..
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why it does it.  Being that this chip could be used in other applications possibly, it's possible it's either for diagnostic purposes, or something else in which I have no clue..
<br />
<br />to be honest, i think it's a waste of electricity (which may be why this player could take 4 batteries, as backups...)
<br />
<br />it's an old Kenwood player, was expensive in it's days (though so was most of the CD players)
