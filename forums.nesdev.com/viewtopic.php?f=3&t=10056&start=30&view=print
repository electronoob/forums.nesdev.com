(The founders of the field assumed a positive carrier. But electrons are negatively charged)<br />The source is where the so-called &quot;majority carrier&quot; enters. For NMOS, these are those fictional positively charged carriers, and they move the opposite direction of real electrons.<br />For PMOS, they are &quot;holes&quot; (like in soda) that the positive carriers jump between.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> Is it symmetrical, so that an NMOS transistor's source and drain could be swapped with no ill effects?</div> Mostly. The exact geometry of the parts can be changed to be better when used one direction than another (by having more or less of the gate sit over the drain, usually). Also, many discrete MOSFETs have extra diodes added so that you can only use them in one direction.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">My take-away is that these &quot;pseudo&quot;-pull-up-resistors built with polysilicon (is it actually full transistors?) are better than the real thing in NMOS, because they waste less power to accomplish the same effect compared to an actual pull-up resistor.</div> I believe they're actually using self-biased nMOSFETs here because they are faster: a resistor here would have the constitutive relationship of I=V÷R; self-biased MOSFETs are (I think) I=k·V², so it'll charge from 0V faster.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Is charging &quot;to&quot; Vcc the same as drawing current from Vcc?</div> I'd say that's correct.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Are NMOS transistors good at shorting to ground, while PMOS transistors are good at driving from Vcc?

The reason you need both is that enhancement mode nMOSFETs need a higher voltage on their gate than on their drain; historically it was easier to make <br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor-transistor_logic" class="postlink">Resistor-transistor logic</a>, and nowadays it's been decided it's better to build wells of P-doped silicon and drop some pMOSFETs in them; the only historical alternative is to require at least two separate voltage rails (Motor drivers, where the superior &quot;on resistance&quot; of nMOSFETs matters, still do that).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Anatomy of a FET (field effect transistor):<br /><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/IGFET_N-Ch_Enh_Labelled_simplified.svg" alt="Image" /> <span style="font-size: 50%; line-height: normal">thanks wikipedia for this picture.</span><br />D = drain, S = source, G = gate.<br /><br />The concept of &quot;enhancement&quot; mode and &quot;depletion&quot; mode transistors relates to the channel in the semi-conductor. In a enhancement mode transitor, there's no channel present between the source and drain terminals so current does not flow through it unless the voltage between the gate and source (Vgs) is above a certain threshold called (intuitively) the <strong>threshold voltage</strong> (Vth). In the depletion mode transistor it's the exact opposite: a channel between the drain and source already exist, so it happily conducts current normally, and in order to cut off the current the gate voltage has to be below the source voltage by a certain value (called Vth again). Compare the two modes of FETs: Vth &gt; 0 with an enhancement mode one, Vth &lt; 0 with a depletion mode one.<br /><br />The original 6502 (and the 2A03) is an NMOS device; all transistors are NMOS transistors. And yes ― those so called pull-up resistors are truly fully functional transistors. On the same die, there are <strong>both</strong> enhancement mode and depletion mode NMOS transistors. Have a look at this part of the 6502 schematic:<br /><br /><img src="http://img15.imageshack.us/img15/4581/6502detailschem.png" alt="Image" /><span style="font-size: 50%; line-height: normal"> sorry dude for hot linking this pic!</span><br /><br />On this picture, enhancement mode transistors are those that have a thin gate, depletion mode ones have a thick gate and have the drain tied to Vcc. Notice that all depletion mode transistors have the gate and source terminals shorted together, giving a Vgs of 0V. With that kind of transistor, this is a sufficient condition to obtain a constant current source flowing out of the source, provided it can flow into something.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks lidnariq and Jarhmander!<br /><br />(The images below got a bit big - sorry about that  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />)<br /><br />To tie this back to how things look in Visual 2A03/Visual 2C02 in case anyone else is following along, here's how a depletion-mode transistor looks, along with my (hopefully correct <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />) annotations. They're used as as a type of &quot;pseudo-resistors&quot; on power sources (red).<br /><br /><img src="http://s22.postimg.org/52aj3nwht/depletion.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Here's an ordinary enhancement-mode transistor. When the polysilicon is high/1, the yellow part (unpowered diffusion) is driven low/0 (current on it will flow into the green ground).<br /><br /><img src="http://s18.postimg.org/mjf265n49/enhancement.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Here's some logic (related to controlling when the first pulse channel plays):<br /><br /><img src="http://s7.postimg.org/yosjqsmh7/logic.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />If any of the gates in red circles are high, the power from the power source will drain into ground, disabling the channel. The gate in the blue circle is controlled by the APU clock, and whenever it &quot;ticks&quot; the value from below is let through and is sampled. (This is what a signal being &quot;buffered on&quot; e.g. the APU clock means.)<br /><br />If you click on a node, you can see its name (from nodenames.js) in the upper-right if it has one. The four &quot;disabling&quot; wires in this case seem to be related to the length counter reaching zero (sq0_silence, possibly related to the channel being enabled and the duty cycle as well), the sweep unit overflowing (10636), the timer's period being &lt; 8 (10094), and the last one I haven't looked at. At least those two unnamed ones should probably be given names (quietust?).<br /><br />Clicking around to find already named nodes helps when trying to figure out what an area &quot;is about&quot;.<br /><br />Oh, and another term while I'm at it: If one node &quot;inverts into&quot; another, it just means that the second node is always the inverse of the first. Maybe obvious, but I didn't get it at first. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
