		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK we already mentioned in this board that some of us had 2D dreams taking place in video games. I hardly every remember what I dram, but last night I did one who was just SO awesome that I have to post it on this board.
<br />
<br />This takes place at the end of a RPG. I were about to fight the last boss who is a big bad guru of some sect. However, by just walking to him and talk to him, he was super strong and wiped out my party. So I looked at a walkthrough, and you had to do a trick to catch the guru off guard, so that he would be weaker.
<br />
<br />What you had to do is introduce in a ceremony of the sect where they are scarifying pigs to the guru, by disguising yourself in a pig. Then you took the control of a pig, and you had to somehow control it so it would walk at the same speed as the other pigs - if you were too slow or too fast they would notice it's not a real pig and your plan would fail. I was almost being too slow, in the queue of the herd, but I was alright and did not get caught. Then at the time they were going to scarify your pig, with some kind of guillotine, you had to enter a password - the password was "Cefka" (lass boss form Final Fantasy VI). Unfortunately, I woke up there so I'll never know how you could manage to fight the guru off guard this way <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />But nevertheless this is AWESOME and I wish a game would have such a sequence ! Now how could POSSIBLY 4 heroes hide in a pig disguise to introduce a sect ? And how a guillotine could be disabled with a password ? There is many fun ideas in RPGs, but this one would surpass them all  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I haven't ever played BOF4 (yet ?) so it's not it that inspired this dream.
<br />
<br />However, I think the guillotine part was inspired from Chrono Trigger, and the pig part from Final Fantasy IV where you could be turned into pigs by a spell. Also, this have probably been inspired from The Lord of the Rings, where Frodo and Sam hide themselves as Orcs to intruder the evil lands of Sauron, and had to act like orcs. I read that very long ago so I barely remember a few things.

<br />Anyway, March of the Pigs... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> 
<br />
<br />I get weird dreams all the time - some of them even come true! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> 
<br />
<br />Like when I dreamt I was playing a Mario/Sonic game merged together; then later discover Somari.
