<br />
<br />Tilificator is a sprite conversion tool I wrote to try to solve an annoying problem I've always had with sprite graphics for the NES: How to create CHR and sprite data that re-uses CHR patterns and tries to minimize the sprites per scanline, without lots of repetitive effort. 
<br />
<br />To do this for you, it uses some clever heuristics, and a lot of brute-force, trading artist time for computer time. It's a work in progress, and will still produce bad results for some seemingly obvious cases. But it'll probably do the job better for big amounts of sprite data unless you're dedicated to hand-optimizing your sprites. :)
<br />
<br />Have a try with it, and give me your feedback!

While the 'TilingMethodDragQueen' is the most capable (albeit slowest) of the methods to choose from, each of the methods suffer from the limitation that they will process each image separately, and try to match it to the tile table already built. To get better results for the cases where the optimal tilification for one image actually gives a crappy match for a later one, there'd probably be a need for a pre-pass that looks for similarities in all images at once. <br /><br />I have some ideas for how this could work, but no idea when I'd get the motivation to do so, considering how much time this "side-project" of mine has already eaten up :)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">On a side note, not sure if you're aware of this, but the .zip contains the .svn directory.</div><br /><br />Indeed I am aware of this.

<br />Hmm, that shows that PyGTK (the python interface to GTK+) is being found, but that one cannot find the .DLL files of GTK+. According to Google, this is usually caused by having installed multiple versions of GTK+, missing the GTK+ directory on the %PATH% system variable (which the all-in-one installer should have done for you), and other tricky issues.
<br />
<br />Could you maybe give me some more info such as: exactly how you installed it, what your %PATH% variable is, what Windows version you're running, phase of the moon, etc?

<br />I remember having the same problem with GTK some other time, not with Python though. Pretty sure it was caused by non-compatible version of GTK (libgtk*.dll) in Windows' System32/SysWOW64 directory.

<br />
<br />Yes, that could indeed be the case... I'd suggest doing a global search for libgtk*.dll across the file system and removing those, or at least renaming them temporarily.
<br />
<br />Unless you changed this at installation, the proper .dll's should be in c:\gtk\bin, so also double check that your %PATH% environment includes this path.

<br />
<br />Pardon me for leading you on the wrong path (no pun intended) in this case. I realize now that my c:\gtk\bin directory is from some old installation and is not used by PyGTK.
<br />
<br />My installation of PyGTK uses the .dll files under 'C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\gtk-2.0\runtime\bin'. (did you just forget the '\bin' ending part in your post above?) I was also able to reproduce an error similar to yours by renaming the 'bin' directory to the dummy name 'binn':
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Traceback &#40;most recent call last&#41;:<br />&nbsp; File &quot;E:\rnb\tilificator\trunk\tilificatorgui.py&quot;, line 23, in &lt;module&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; import gtk, gobject, cairo, pango<br />&nbsp; File &quot;C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\gtk-2.0\gtk\__init__.py&quot;, line 30, in &lt;module&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; import gobject as _gobject<br />&nbsp; File &quot;C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\gtk-2.0\gobject\__init__.py&quot;, line 26, in &lt;module&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; from glib import spawn_async, idle_add, timeout_add, timeout_add_seconds, \<br />&nbsp; File &quot;C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\gtk-2.0\glib\__init__.py&quot;, line 22, in &lt;module&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; from glib._glib import *<br />ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found</div><br /><br />I could then restore the normal behavior by doing:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">set PATH=C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\gtk-2.0\runtime\binn;%PATH%</div>
<br />
<br />To make the dummy 'binn' directory name still be searched. Maybe you could try this to put the directory on the path explicitly? (even if it seems that is unnecessary on my system)
<br />
<br />However, it's possible you must also make sure Windows cannot find any other conflicting .dlls, as specific directories (such as system,system32 etc) have priority over the ones in %PATH% in later Windows versions, IIRC...
