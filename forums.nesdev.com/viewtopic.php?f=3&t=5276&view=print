		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was just adjusting the timing of the NMI routine in my game so that I could use blank tiles during the top scanlines in order to hide scrolling glitches and then switch in the correct patterns at a very specific time (as soon as the last blank scanline finishes, so that the background is completely blank but the sprites are ready to be fetched for the next scanline) in order for the following scanlines to be rendered properly.
<br />
<br />So, there I was playing with the cycles to get the bankswitch to happen exactly at the end of the visible scanline, but the 3 emulators I normally use for testing (Nestopia, Nintendulator and FCEUXD) couldn't agree on what the correct point was.
<br />
<br />Then I took 3 different builds to my PowerPak and turns out Nintendulator was the correct one. I guess this is no surprise, everyone always talks about how accurate it is and such. But I was surprised at how wrong Nestopia was. The switch was happening much too soon, almost by the middle of the scanline. FCEUXD was somewhere in between.
<br />
<br />I don't know what I plan to accomplish with this post, I guess I'm just writing because I'm surprised. And pissed off, because my game won't look the same across emulators, it will look glitched in some. I guess I will revise my code and look for something that might be throwing the emulators off, but it sure does suck having to take emulation issues into account for my game to look good in most platforms.

<br />
<br />Emulators are tested predominantly using games which were originally written + tested on actual hardware.  The goal is often "how can I get my emulator to work with X game", and there are all kinds of one-offs in emulators for certain things.
<br />
<br />Your post is more or less a present-day rant that follows in the same line of rants people had during the post-Nesticle days.  There were no NES development carts, no one doing hardware dev or RE for the NES, so those of us wanting to write stuff for the NES only had Nesticle.  We wrote our code so that it worked on Nesticle and assumed it would work on the real thing, or on other emulators -- bzzt, wrong.  My FF2j/e intro code for Demiforce is a wonderful example of such a beast (breaking horribly on most present-day emulators and the actual NES, but works fine in Nesticle).
<br />
<br />Welcome to emulation.

I mean, yeah, Nintendulator and the actual NES are showing the same thing, but there is a chance that I'm making a mistake and not taking into account some other factor that is making the error more evident in the other emulators. I'll post back when/if I find out more.
<br />
<br />BTW, sorry about the rant. I hate ranting. Feel free to move this to general or whatever, as it doesn't really help emulator development.

<br />
<br />If you've code which works correctly on the real thing and on Nintendulator (which is known for being quite timing-accurate), but not on other emulators, I would say you've got a good test case for emulator authors.  :-)
<br />
<br />Someone may have to poke at Nestopia's code to see if they can figure out a fix, since it's one of the most popular emulators right now.  The Nestopia Forum doesn't get a lot of attention (and AFAIK, the author doesn't visit it), so I'd say maybe contact the author directly.

Still, when the logic is more organized I guess I will contact Nestopia's author.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, your post is relevant because I was under the impression that Nestopia was as much accurate if not even better than Nintendulator, so it shows me that impression was wrong.
<br />
<br />It's a kind of worst cycle : As long as we say "I don't want to do this trick because it only works on Nintendulator/real HW", nobody will ever do this trick and it will remain badly emulated. Someone needs to release a really great homebrew game relying heavily on $2004 reads and precise timing so that all emulator authors will be forced to fix them to show correct results. However, since such a game will only work on Nintendulator most people will think "cool I'm going to download it" only to figure it doesn't work on their favourite emulator and delete it without even reading the readme file stating they must use Nintendulator. Nestopia is much more user-firendly and faster, so it's most likely the lambda emu user will be using it.
<br />
<br />And unfortunately, we are absolutley forced to use emulators when doing developpement, no matter what everyone says. The real NES doesn't have any nametable viewer, debugger nor CPU tracter. And it's really slow to test your stuff on. Also you can only test your region (PAL in my case), and not the other one arround.

<br />I think the reason we use known games (here we mean Zelda, SMB, ...) to test our emulators is because these are known to work on a real NES  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> thus if they work in your emulator, you have a chance you're "close" to the real NES.  
<br />
<br />The homebrew scene is vastly different, much harder to emulate, and shows most emulator developers (myself included) how far away their emulation is from truth.  There are those of you out there that are helping us and have created ROMs in two categories:
<br />
<br />1. Test ROMs to help emulator developers verify their emulator behavior against what is expected within the real NES.  [PPU timing, 6502 operands, sprite hit, etc.]
<br />2. Demo ROMs that exploit the capabilites of the real NES to the extent that most games (Zelda, SMB, ...) never do because they were focused more on gameplay / presentation.  [full palettes onscreen, scrolling tricks, etc.]
<br />
<br />The first category are VERY useful if the goal is emulation of games (Zelda, SMB, ...).  The second category is useful if the goal includes emulation of all possible homebrew ROMs.
<br />
<br />As a development tool writer I want people to expect to get coverage of both categories.  Thus I would expect both categories of ROMs described above to work in my emulator.  I am finding MOST of these ROMs are documented as working on a real NES...but some aren't...so it is hard to know whether a FAIL result in a ROM is a real FAIL on a real NES or not.
<br />
<br />As a deeper example, I seem to have conflicting advice from different test ROMs that I've run regarding whether sprite hit detection should be functional when the background and/or sprites are displayed via the PPUMASK.  One gives me a fault saying sprite hit detection should work as expected even when sprites are disabled, and the other says the opposite.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" />

<br />For a hit to happen there need a nontransparent BG pixel and nontransparent spritepixel, and not in the rightmost column (255). Both must be enabled of course, but since emulating that a hit always happen won't break any games (does anyone know how you could possibly rely on the flag NOT being set without making it on purpose ?), many emulators went that way.

<br />IIRC, pixels disabled in PPUMASK are treated as transparent. Which ROMs are you talking about?

<br />I meant to go back and edit my post but didn't get to it fast enough.  The confusion was on my part.  I was confusing the sprite HIT tests with the sprite OVERFLOW tests.  I now have both test ROM sets passing.
<br />
<br />I'll post my test ROM - specific questions as another thread so as not to stomp on this topic more than I already have.

<br />Yeah, since I don't have a GBA and (of course) your private emulator, I guess I can post the 3 test ROMs I used on my PowerPak, so you guys can make your own tests.
<br />
<br />Don't expect anything fancy though, the only thing you can see is a 16-scanline border at the top of the screen followed by a solid color for the remaining 224 scanlines. And a few glitched sprites at the top left corner (ignore them!). Nintendulator's output matched my NES (except for the sprites, but that's because I don't initialize the RAM used for sprites while the PowerPak BIOS uses it).
<br />
<br />I'll post the ROMs later, since they're on my other PC which is turned off at the moment and I'm gonna prepare dinner now.

<br />Of course it's not, I just haven't worried about sprites yet. My sprite code is done but not active in this ROM yet, and since the junk sprites do not bother me I won't care about a temporary "fix". Soon I'll make the sprite system active.
