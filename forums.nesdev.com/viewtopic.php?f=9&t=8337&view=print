		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i tried several roms. i tried PGR0 and PGR1
<br />
<br />Both freeze at the intro or after the stage 1 begin to load.
<br />
<br />its seem this game is compatible. 
<br />
<br />Right now i have 1.35b2 with loopy mapper. But the savestates mapper are not installed. i know they can help with colors in Kirby but anyway the game doesnt work at all. i remove the savestate mapper, because i erase my startropics 2 sram save because i pressed the button to save state in error.  anyway i dont know exactly what i did wrong but i prefer to dont use save state. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />
<br />NOTE: i spent all my days testing different games and roms. I tried more than 200 roms and games. i tried all the games i like to play.
<br />the only games that i found a problem was Big Nose (now fixed by loopy)and Kirby's adventure ( game freezing)  All others games i like are playing correctly.   ( a lot of camerica games have screen problem with my crt tv but i dont play them anyway )  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />THANKS FOR HELP AGAIN

<br />
<br />i tried more than 10 differents kirby roms, both of them freeze. But the game never freeze exactly at the same place. Still, it freeze before the stage 1 is ready to play.
<br />
<br />im very sad about this one, i hope my nes powerpak is not defect.
<br />
<br />its the only game that freeze,  i tried  more than 200 games.
<br />
<br />if nobody can help me tomorrow i will put a video on youtube. when the game freeze we see glitch at the screen.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Somebody emailed me about having problems with Kirby some time ago with my save state mappers. Interestingly enough, she said that it worked with loopy's mappers. Maybe it's related to the color problems which some users have reported (something like WRAM corruption could be causing both problems, altho that problem should be fixed in the latest loopy mappers and latest save state mappers).
<br />
<br />Anyway, I highly doubt that your PowerPak is defective.

( i dont use save states mappers)  As soon as i copy latest loopy mappers, kirby freeze within 2 minutes. CAN SOMEONE CONFIRM IT TOO ?  THANKS
<br />
<br />Good news. Kirby work with original mappers from retrousb.com
<br />
<br />mappers 1.34
<br />
<br />i will do more testing
<br />
<br />edit1:  even with original mapper 1.34 screen problem with my crt tv happen with camerica games.
<br />
<br />edit2: WITH 1.35b2 MAPPERS KIRBY WORKS !!!
<br />I think the problem are the latest loopy mappers. i will confirm it later.
<br />maybe last loopy mappers have problem with kirby? isnt?
<br />
<br />edit3:  IT SEEMS THAT LATEST LOOPY MAPPERS MAKES KIRBY FREEZE.
<br />But the stage 1 begin this time. But still freeze after a few seconds.
<br />install the latest loopy mappers and try to finish the kirby first stage.
<br />( the save states mappers are not installed)
<br />
<br />edit: OK IM 100% SURE OF IT. I did more testing. i reinstalled different mappers several times.  Latest mappers from Loopy make Kirby freezing. you cant even finish the first stage.

<br /><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~olimar/NES/powerpak_mmc3_0.zip" class="postlink">powerpak_mmc3_0.zip</a> (interestingly, this one gives me palette issues)

<br /><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~olimar/NES/powerpak_mmc3_4.zip" class="postlink">powerpak_mmc3_4.zip</a>
<br />
<br />Is this on a real NES console or a famiclone?
