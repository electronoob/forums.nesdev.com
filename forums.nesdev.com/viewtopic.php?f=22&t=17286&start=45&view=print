Sorry for the inconvenience.</div><br />(I quoted myself because this is the first comment on a new page of comments, and I want to keep the context of the conversation in place).<br /><br />Once I edited that line in...it works in most emulators. It doesn't work in Nintendulator.<br /><br />I think the reason is because you put the reset code at $8458 in the swappable bank. reset code should be at $e000-ffff in the fixed bank. And your reset code should explicitly put the correct banks in place before you use them.<br /><br />I think, if you did those 2 fixes, it would would in nearly all emulators.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Random is exactly what happens when you <em>don't</em> touch anything.<br /><br />It's my experience that almost all issues with certain emulators or real hardware come from failing to initialize everything you need. This includes both clearing RAM, setting hardware states (such as enabling IRQ), and configuring your mapper chip. You have to rely on a static bank with your reset vector in it, and within this bank you add your initialization code to make sure the remaining banks are mapped correctly.<br /><br />The last similar issue I ran into was a feature I had completely forgotten in the MMC3 - writing to the cartridge RAM is impossible if the write lock is set, and just like everything else, it might &quot;randomly&quot; be so on hardware or certain emulators.

The emulators were setting them to a predefined default when it was not the case on the real thing.  Once I found that then my code was working fine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My assumption is that you're running your music within the NMI.<br /><br />The reason this is a problem is that NMI implicitly does a SEI (cleared by the RTI popping the processor flags). So if your music update happens in your NMI routine, it will overlap and block your interrupts if it takes too long, which it does on NTSC.<br /><br />Easy fix: just put a CLI in the NMI routine just before it calls the music playback (assuming it is the last thing that happens in your NMI handler). Otherwise if that's not feasible, you can just move the music playback outside of the NMI. It doesn't really matter too much where it gets called as long as it's once per frame, preferably at a consistent time (which is why NMI is usually convenient).<br /><br /><br />Edit: Actually, peeking at it in a debugger, it looks like your NMI is missing an RTI at the end? It seems to roll right into the IRQ handler after finishing. So in this case, I'd recommend putting a CLI before the music playback there, and also an RTI before the IRQ handler begins.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;03:E224: A9 00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA #$00<br />&nbsp;03:E226: 85 02&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;STA $02 = #$03<br />&nbsp;03:E228: 20 4C E8&nbsp; JSR $E84C ; music playback? place a CLI right before this line<br />&nbsp;03:E22B: 68&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PLA<br />&nbsp;03:E22C: A8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TAY<br />&nbsp;03:E22D: 68&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PLA<br />&nbsp;03:E22E: AA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TAX<br />&nbsp;03:E22F: 68&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PLA ; shouldn't an RTI follow this line?<br />&gt;03:E230: 48&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PHA ; IRQ handler starts here<br />&nbsp;03:E231: 8A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TXA<br />&nbsp;03:E232: 48&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PHA<br />&nbsp;03:E233: 98&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TYA<br />&nbsp;03:E234: 48&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PHA<br />...<br />&nbsp;03:E260: 40&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RTI</div>
