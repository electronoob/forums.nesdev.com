I might add another button to completely reset the read/write/execute statistics later. Searching memory will also probably be in the next release.

I see red/blackish maroon when code is logged, and my following example is when the rom is first read with a SEI (78). <br /><br />I have the debugger already set to a snapped setting before loading the rom, I load the rom, and then I step into every opcode. So I see the SEI get it's color changed to red, but when I hit refresh after that SEI has been logged, it doesn't reset the color to the hex's original default color. So to me, it gives me the assumption this code is constantly being logged, when it's not anymore. <br /><br />I've also noticed that I cannot write hex code consistently, Im only allowed to write one hex value, then I have to click the very next address I want to edit, in order to edit it. <br /><br />Seriously this is a dream coming true for me, with what you have released! I keep checking back here for any new info and updates. I'm having a lot of fun with this debugger! I'm looking forward to future updates, thank you for this!

The colored bytes are meant to show everything that's been marked as code or data for the entire time that the ROM has been running; the refresh button just causes the window to show the most up-to-date view. Like I said, I might add the option to clear the usage logging in a later version.<br /><br />The memory editing itself will be a bit more keyboard-friendly as well, but for now you can also enter multiple bytes by moving the cursor around with the keyboard (though it's still a little bit cumbersome...)

That was always its goal, though.<br /><br />That people continue to use xkas v06 to this day (and syntax-compatible clones of it like ASAR) is one of my greater sources of shame.

(Apparently ikari_01 has already been using it for debugging sd2snes / MSU-1 stuff, which is cool!)<br /><br />The closed-source nature of Geiger's debugger was one of my big reasons for starting this; I got a good couple of years' worth of use out of it but I eventually decided it was too buggy and crash-prone to put up with anymore, and it was obvious it was pretty much going to stay that way forever. (As for no$sns, I tried it once and somehow SMP breakpoints just flat-out refused to ever trigger, which made it totally useless for what I was doing at the time, so I gave up on it...)<br /><br />It also occurred to me that (to my knowledge) there have never been any debuggers with proper SA-1 or SuperFX break/step support, so that seemed like another necessity (and I thank you for bsnes 073 having that Super FX disassembler tucked away, it was a good starting point <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">One thing I've been considering was to expand the usage bytes to longs, and then storing the <em>number</em> of reads/writes/executes.

It's also kind of interesting to note that it's sort of the opposite of what I (and the person who brought up the code/data highlighting idea originally) thought to use it for - that is, seeing the stuff that <em>doesn't</em> get highlighted, in order to potentially find unused/obscure stuff (or just free ROM/RAM space).  It would definitely be cool to have more detailed statistics available for other purposes, though.
