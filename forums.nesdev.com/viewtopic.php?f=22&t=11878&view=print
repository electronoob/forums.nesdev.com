Thoughts?<br /><br />The NES and GameBoy weren't known for fast-paced fighting game action, so I enjoy the novelty of seeing a game like UMK3 running on the hardware.<br /><br />Here is a video of some gameplay just released: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwoVsvt7luI" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwoVsvt7luI</a><br />EDIT: The video is of the GBC version. The NES version would use the same sprite graphics, but with a larger play field. Flicker would be marginally increased (which you can see occasionally in the video). The GBC demo is complete gameplay-wise. Only major thing missing is making more graphics (which isn't really a challenge from a technical standpoint). The video is to demonstrate that an 8-bit fighting game has potential.<br /><br />I'm working on getting some more videos up.<br /><br />I also have a Twitter page to follow the project: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://twitter.com/PortableMK">https://twitter.com/PortableMK</a><!-- m -->

I've edited to the original post to be more clear, so thanks for the feedback.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">OneCrudeDude wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Not to put you down or anything, but I know for a fact you won't finish this game because it is simply too ambitious.  Too much ambition will crush your working motive.</div><br /><br />Which game? The GBC or NES version? The UMK3 project is not intended to have all the arcade fighters. What you see on the &quot;Select Your Fighter&quot; screen is the roster, which is very manageable. This isn't a 100 fighter mugen project. The NES project/conversion isn't underway yet, I'm just curious if you guys in NES-land have any interest in seeing a fighter game for the system. It's not a problem if you don't, as the GBC project is virtually finished anyway (sans-graphics).<br /> <br />I don't think ambition is such a bad thing as so many people want to believe. Even unfinished projects like Retro City Rampage are still neat to see on the system. And would anyone criticize Super Bat Puncher for still being an unfinished demo? Hell, even things like Tokumaru's NES Sonic mockups are great to see.<br /><br />Ambition is what motivates us to push the boundaries and reach new heights. &quot;Failure&quot; is not even trying in the first place; especially if it is something that you want to do. And if you really think about it, nothing is ever really &quot;100%&quot; complete. &quot;Complete&quot; is just an idea.

Oh wait.<br /><br />(but yeah, if this was a movie it'd be taken down immediately, but a demake of an old game that doesn't even trigger the autoflagging bot? hm...)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Back in 2009, Arika Ltd. was using OCILLA notices of claimed infringement (which are manual, not autoflags) to take down videos of fan remakes of one of its games, including one of my videos. Square Enix is notorious for cease-and-desists against noncommercial fan remakes of its games. Even Nintendo has been using Content ID (the autoflagging bot) to take the advertising revenue from partners who make Let's Play videos. Ultimately I do want to see fighting games on NES and GBC, but with original art. Using <em>Mortal Kombat</em> characters is like using Bugs Bunny. But I don't know if the similarity between <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=10710" class="postlink">RHDE: Furniture Fight</a> and WB's <em>Rampart</em> makes me a hypocrite.<br /><br />Now the technical problem: GBC allows up to 10 sprites per scanline, which is half the screen's width. NES allows only 8, which not only produces more flicker with characters of the same size but also is smaller relative to the whole screen. And GBC has 8 sprite palettes compared to the NES's 4, so projectiles would have to share with something.

For NES, I could do the extra sprites, but there would be the additional problem of limited palettes. I think the bigger problem would be him causing the fighters to flicker to much, especially when they are fallen, as they take up the most horizontal space that way.<br /><br />Currently the GB version uses two palettes on some fighters (Jax, Kung Lao, Shao Kahn, Jade's staff), so all of the NES sprite pallets would be used up on the fighters alone. For the blood, I think I would remove the droplets but keep the splash. The large blood splash is actually an animated background area that merges with the map. This is also how I pull off large projectiles like Scorpion's spear, Reptile's spit, and SubZero's iceblast. The backgrounds (above the floor) are designed to only use 3 of the 4 colors, so that the 4th color can be the projectile or blood splash.  <br /><br />Since I have a fighting engine finished, I was also considering just swapping out the graphics and tweaking the gameplay to create a brand new fighting game. I think for a NES project I would limit the fighter roster to just 5-7 characters.
