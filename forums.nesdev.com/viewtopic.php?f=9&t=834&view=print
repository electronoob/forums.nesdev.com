Not sure why this is, maybe clearing some of the copynes data. Oh yeah, and playing the cart would work fine before restarting the nes and after.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've just received my CopyNES a few days ago, and I've had the chance to fix a reasonable handful of bugs in the Win32 client code - for example, Bankwatch now works correctly.
<br />
<br />I've also successfully made a CNROM devcart, using two 32KB SRAMs and a pair of slide switches (one for mirroring, one for PRG write protection), and I've added support for it to CopyNESW. A note to anyone who might want to make one of these: the PRG ROM normally ties /CE to ground and /OE to the chip select signal - if you drop in a 62256, (along with rerouting A14 from pin 27 to pin 1 and connecting R/W to pin 27), these <strong>must</strong> be switched around  - I neglected to do so, and spent several hours wondering why a bunch of RAM was seemingly corrupted ($8000-$87FF [$0000-$07FF], $A000-$A007 [$2000-$2007], $C000-$C017 [$4000-$4017], and a few others for the CopyNES port chip).
<br />
<br />As always, the latest software can be found at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.qmtpro.com/~nes/copynes/">http://www.qmtpro.com/~nes/copynes/</a><!-- m -->

<br />BTW, how is your client checking the BIOS version? I haven't looked real hard, but I don't recall seeing a function to tell you that.

<br />
<br />What exactly are you referring to? My client has a function 'int FindVersion(void)' which replicates the functionality of the function 'SUB findver (void)' in the QBASIC client: it sends byte 0xA2 and then waits for a reply - if it receives a reply, then said reply contains the version number (always 2 or higher - if it gets 0xA2, then your parallel port isn't running in bidirectional mode).
<br />The original BIOS version does not contain a 'version request' command (kevtris didn't think of implementing it until I asked; once he added MicroBug(tm), which was contained within the BIOS, he needed some way to make sure the BIOS was the proper version) - in this case, the client will time out from waiting for the reply and assume the BIOS is version 1.

But I see now when kevtris updated the software package a week or 2 ago, a lot has been changed. You must have had this newer version before hand.
