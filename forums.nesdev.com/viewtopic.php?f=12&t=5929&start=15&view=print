<br />Sure!
<br />Didn't mean to sound like you have to in any way.
<br />Just wanted to mention that it's available for research should you ever feel like it.
<br />I don't see an EPROM on that pcb, though. Are you refering to the 8464a-10 right next to the battery? That's an 8k SRAM.

<br />Yup when you said C0 I knew that was the problem.  Should be an easy fix.  All regs are only on when the boot rom is enabled so it doesn't affect any running games.

<br />
<br />I can't wait for autoloading (that's really a better feature to me than autosaving).  If I may make a suggestion, I suggest keeping things simple when/if you implement this.  Rather than having an clunky menu, it would be better I think to just have the SRM file show up by default under "Load Battery RAM", and if the user wants to load an SRM file other than the one with the same file name as the SMC file, s/he need only select "Load Battery RAM" as before.
<br />
<br />The one weakness I see with this simple approach is in situations where someone might want to load a completely blank SRM file, but the obvious remedy is just to keep a spare blank file on the card. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />EDIT: Oh, and also separate toggles in the config file (e.g. "AUTOLOAD=1") would be nice too.
<br />
<br />Anyway, awesome update!  Keep up the good work!

<br />A lot of LCD TVs have something called "picture in picture", where one "sub" picture is drawn in a small window over a full-screen "main" picture. I seem to remember trying some 240p consoles like the NES and Super NES on my Vizio TV, and the composite video looked as sharp as a DS.
<br />
<br />But now my question: Why does the "long reset" take so much longer with the SNES PowerPak than the NES one?

There seem especially to be issues with what I assume to be alternating scanlines (for blinking), for instance, when you target all in FFV, I tend to have the cursor either not appear at all or appear as a regular, non-blinking cursor.  Chnaging the settings, I can get it to appear like a comb, which is actually better, but the same settings result in intolerable jumpiness when the screen scrolls.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But now my question: Why does the "long reset" take so much longer with the SNES PowerPak than the NES one?</div>
<br />Interesting...  Not that it's been an annoyance to me by any means - I played through FFIV from beginning to end on my PowerPak.

<br />This is simply because as in Contra 3, the name extends into the mapper field. It says THE DUEL: TEST DRIVE 2, which is 22 bytes instead of the 21 bytes reserved for the game title. And ASCII "2" equals $32. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
