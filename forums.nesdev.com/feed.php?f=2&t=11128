This might not seem like much, but 0 saturation means you have a grayscale, so you can free up hue x0 and xD, in addition to potentially adding more hues.<br /><br />If you don't want to change the clock signal, you can keep the NES's palette the exact same, but with the extra saturation bits, think of it like you're choosing from 4 different sets of x0 and xD columns (not literally, just when generating color, because x0 and xD are used for the chroma wave's peaks), where one set is how the NES is right now, another set has x0 and xD as the same, and the other two sets are two intermediates.<br /><br />In the actual palette itself, column x0 can act like a grayscale column where the high 4 bits select a luminance, so 00 would be black, F0 would be white, and 10, 20, ..., D0, E0 would all be grays. If that's too much, then just using the 2 luma bits is enough; you'd get black, white, and two grays, with the saturation bits having no effect. However, desaturated colors would also produce 4 different grays of their own (doesn't contain black or white though, which is why I suggest a dedicated grayscale column), so you'd actually have 8 grays to choose from, although not linearly mapped.<br /><br />This would be much easier to work with because hue, luma, and saturation are all simple ranges. Plus, fading the palette to grayscale would be as simple as fading it to black.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Sun Apr 06, 2014 1:50 am</p><hr />

Yeah. We're kinda hamstrung by the standards inadvertently specifying the intersection of the RGB colorspace with the YIQ colorspace. And if we generate the video natively in HSL (phase/amplitude/DC), that's a third colorspace constraint, leading to either a lot of desaturated colors or a lot of out of gamut ones.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Sat Apr 05, 2014 4:50 pm</p><hr />

For NTSC, it turns out that if you have a N-bit DAC clocked at exactly 3×CB, you can map each of the three samples in sequence to an R, G, and B component. You don't even need a real modulator; just the right choice of RGB to produce hue -U for colorburst.<br /><br />In any case, the problem with the NES is mostly figuring out how to represent a useful palette and pack it into 8 bits. Above 8 bits, I figure you may as well provide a TrueColor representation, even with the caveats that Drag mentioned.<br /><br />The 2600's 3 bits of luma, 4 bits of hue is pretty good. If I were going to extend the NES's master palette, I'd probably use that, and maybe add a bit for high/low saturation.<br /><br />Using a 7× crystal has the nifty property that 7/4 is very very close to 12/7: the pixel aspect ratio is 48/49. It'd be ~300 pixels wide at that dotclock.<br /><br />I might also try something a little more like what the NES provides, but not coupling high and low lumas together.<br />- three bits of phase information (none, 6 from a half of the NES palette, one for averages of luma for extra greys)<br />- three bits of luma_1 (maybe 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14)<br />- two bits of luma_2 (maybe 1,5,9,13)<br />You only need half the phase information here because part of it's encoded in whether luma_1 &gt; luma_2 or vice versa.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Thu Apr 03, 2014 7:24 pm</p><hr />

I think, all things considered, the NES's palette is extremely capable; it's mostly the limited number of simultaneous colors that tends to be the wrench, at least for me.<br /><br />At least, when you work with limited RGB based palettes (like R, G, and B all being 2 bits), it's hard to get the color you want because red, green, and blue all have different luminosities, and to get the brightness you want, you often have to skew the hue or deal with desaturating it, and although RGB is a simpler concept to grasp, the NES's luma/chroma system offers a better selection of colors that are more balanced overall, so I tend to prefer that. Yeah, not having finer control over saturation is a pain sometimes, but with a little practice, any pixel artist should be able to overcome it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Wed Apr 02, 2014 11:52 am</p><hr />

Thanks for picking up my question so quickly! You guys are great <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />OK, so my understanding so far is that the NES can generate 12 hues (actually delayed square waves?) at 4 different brightness levels, 12 * 4 = 48 colors. These hues (and colors) are not hand-picked but are evenly spaced along the YIQ color wheel. The hardware could have supported another 2 hues (thus 8 more colors) but this would require dividing 7 by 2 and would have made programming more complicated, so they didn't do it. Uh, why not an 8x crystal then? 16 * 4 = 64, which seems perfect... Anyway this is the reason those colors are unused, just copies of black.<br /><br />If I'm not getting it could you explain it to me like I'm five? I think I need a more intuitive understanding before I can get into things like vectorscopes.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6284">seven</a> — Sun Mar 30, 2014 12:30 pm</p><hr />

The NES palette is natively generated in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YIQ" class="postlink">YIQ color space</a>: one choice of hue or saturation, and one choice of brightness. A lot of the nitty-gritty is described <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NTSC_video" class="postlink">on our wiki</a>.<br /><br />Why only twelve angles, in contrast to the 2600's fifteen? The 2600 generates its colors using a series of inverters and RC delays to produce a series of angles around the color wheel. This process is analog, and so comparatively sensitive to noise, voltage rail fluctuations, and process variation. The NES, on the other hand, uses a series of clock dividers for an all-digital color signal until the final output DAC; in this manner a master clock of 6× the color subcarrier for the region (NTSC: 3.58MHz; PAL: 4.43MHz) can produce 12 different hues.<br /><br />So why not a 7× crystal? Dividing by odd numbers is more complicated (while maintaining a 50% duty cycle) than dividing by even numbers. It would also have made the pixel clock different, and so implied a different number of pixels horizontally on screen (240 or 300 instead of 256). Nintendo may have started with the width (inherited from many of its predecessors, including the ColecoVision) and worked from there; at this point they would have to pick some multiple of 10.7MHz to both generate the (5.4MHz) pixel clock and the color subcarrier (3.6MHz).<br /><br />How did they choose the specific brightnesses they did, and why did they not provide more? That I can't say. There's a lot of room within the same fundamental structure (selecting one of 12 different clock phases, driving different taps on a DAC) for a much wider range of brightnesses and saturations then they provided. Without any other changes at all, they could have added a single wire to provide four extra shades of grey (the average of the $x0 and $xD greys, even though those would be fairly close to the five greys already provided).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Fri Mar 28, 2014 11:13 pm</p><hr />

The color video signal is generated by 12 different possible square waves, each is delayed 0 to 11 master clock cycles.  They can be at 4 different brightness levels.  So that's 48 colors there.<br />Then the first column has no color and is only gray, it has three different brightness levels, then a second copy of white.<br />Then there's that column that has weird black (blacker than black), black, and two gray levels.<br />Then the rest of the colors are all black for some reason.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Fri Mar 28, 2014 11:02 pm</p><hr />

The NES palette wasn't designed in the sense that someone picked a nice set of colors that artists would like to use in their games, it was designed to be easily generated by simple hardware. If you have to put it this way, yes, it's a hardware limitation.<br /><br />I can't explain the specifics (I'm sure someone else who understands PAL and NTSC signals in great detail will), but NES colors are generated by square waves of different frequencies, and I'm sure Nintendo was as cheap as possible when deciding how to calculate these waves.<br /><br /><a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NTSC_video" class="postlink">This page</a> explains a bit about how the video signal is generated (I can't understand most of it!).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Mar 28, 2014 10:55 pm</p><hr />
