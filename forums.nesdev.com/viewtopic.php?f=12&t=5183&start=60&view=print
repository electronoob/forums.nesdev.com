<br />You obviously know more about the SuperFX (and SNES in general) than most people on this forum, but some of these seemed more like personal grievances than real issues.
<br />I'm not saying the SuperFX is the best thing ever. I just find these kinds of co-processors interesting. Whether or not anything useful will come out of it is irrelevant to me.

<br />So do I !
<br />Honnestly those limitations sounds like fun, and anyway the Super FX was designed to handle super-fast math to render images to be DMA-ed into the SNES's VRAM. There is no point in running other code in the SFX unless your game deseperately slows down by using only the regular CPU.

<br />Yes, it's no doubt a neat chip. And it can obviously do very cool things. The whole point of my argument was that the SA-1 was better in virtually every way. That's all. If you don't want to use the best, why not use the OBC1 or DSP-2? :P

<br />
<br />It is actually possible to have a additional seperate ROM / RAM on a SFX cart according to the official SNES dev manual.  I guess this is so the SFX could execute code from it's own ROM and keep the main game data on a seperate ROM.

Also the main programm could chnage the SFX programm depending on which features it want for its graphics.

I gave the code to some people so they could port/debug the tototek support from uCON64 but no one seems to have made any progress. Apparently it enters a weird mode for programming where it is mapped differently. Maybe one day someone will make a breakthrough.

<br />
<br />it must be a hard work to do such a project, but 115 $ for one cart and one programmer... no way!
<br />
<br />the second thing ist, that the cart only take games up to 4 MB!
<br />no tales of phantasia?
<br />
<br />sorry, for that price, i build my own games via eproms... 
<br />
<br />much more work, but a lot of fun!
<br />and then u have all cartridges @ home, not a little fuzzy 4mb flashcart.
<br />
<br />
<br />for people who dont want to play... buy this! its the easiest way to test all kinds of roms, patches and so on...
<br />
<br />for gamers.... its shit!
<br />
<br />its a heaven on earth to have a, tales of phantasia english, secret of mana 2 eng, star ocean eng &amp; treasure hunter g cartridge.

<br />To be honnest $120 isn't THAT bad a dev-kit. I'm pretty sure such a kit would have been at the very least 10 times more expensive back then in the SNES area.
<br />And if you only want gaming, honnestly emulators are all you need, now that PCs are fast enough to accurately emulate the SNES while applying nice graphic filters. It's also safer for your saves.

I also don't see how you can complain about the cost. The only reason your EPROMs are cheap are because they are obsolete basically trash kicking its way around for place to place and eventually you will have a harder time finding them and the price for them will increase.
<br />
<br />I also REALLY don't see how you can say the flash cart is bad "for gamers". That makes absolutely no sense at all. If you are a gamer, you want to play games. Presumably you have very limited to no skills. So plugging in a cartridge and programmer and using a menu to put a game on the cartridge is ideal for a "gamer". Making a cartridge with EPROMs is absolutely not for everyone and definitely not "for gamers". I don't even understand how you convinced yourself that it was such a great deal to build all those cartridges. I have no idea what you spent but for less than $100 you could get a Backup Device/Copier to play all those games with next to no effort at all. 
<br />
<br />Honestly building cartridges with EPROMs when it's not your own creation seems to me just to be for two uses, pure piracy or perhaps some sort of collection type piece. And I think alot of people have been asking about how to do it lately because they think they can do it and sell illegal copies of games to make tons of money. Or they some how think like you do and think it's some amazing way to play your rom sets on a real system. 
<br />
<br />Of all the ways to put either homebrew or your ROM files onto a cartridge to play on a real system EPROMs are the least appealing option. Personally I find the best option to be a Copier type device like the Super Wild Card or PowerPAK (even though it isn't a copier) with Flash cartridges like this one and the Tototek one being a close second and EPROM hacked cartridges a distant last ditch third place option. Unless you're making your own game and need to build permanent carts and even then Flash might be a better option.
