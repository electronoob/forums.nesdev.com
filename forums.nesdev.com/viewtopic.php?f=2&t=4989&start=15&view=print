<br />would be interested to know how accurate you find nestopia.. i guess i could do some side by sides with the carts i have too, though obviously not whole palettes

<br />That seems to net me the colors that look the most "accurate" to my eye, when I compare it with my NES, and I've been using this as a reference for designing graphics, that and the palette Chris Covell came up with when he plugged his nes into a tv tuner card, but I've been told that both look awful, even though I don't think so. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />
<br />I think you'll be most successful at finding a palette that people can agree on by trying to properly calibrate your monitor to the sRGB standard, which is the standard for the web, using your monitor's front panel controls. 
<br />Otherwise, what you see on your monitor might not be what somebody else sees on their monitor, even with the same NES palette (or NTSC R-Y and so on settings). In particular, setting up a color temperature (a.k.a. "white point") that is too blue is probably the reason why you don't find oversaturated colors looking oversaturated on your monitor. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

(or something like that) Newer tv's are alot better at this but can stil sometimes lose the signal (in theory) But its definitly true. (pal fixes this by rotating the colour carrier 180 degrees every frame (or was it line?) )

<br />With or without the NTSC filter?
<br />
<br />I've noticed that I need different hue settings to make Nestopia with the NTSC filter match my NES on the same monitor when viewing $0x colors vs. $2x colors. Should I post the details later?

<br />
<br />the default ntsc filter settings don't really change the hues on my system.. i mean sure they add noise and whatnot but the basic colors stay the same.
<br />
<br />I didn't do any extensive testing, just played thru my hack a bit.  FCEUD's colors are pretty good, but they're a little too "complimentary" in the sense that the colors on fceud actually look better than the colors on the nes.  on my tv, the darker colors, especially browns and greens have a lot more black in them than on fceud

Other TVs render $x2 colors closer to violet than cyan, and $x8 colors closer to green than orange.  The canonical NTSC color encoder is the latter, but someone here said TVs that comply with canonical encoder are uncommon.
