Wow, I'm a moron who can't read. Thanks for pointing that out to me. :S<br /><br />So in that case, checking for two identical PPU fetches would be viable in differentiating between BG and sprite fetches. In addition, if you detect <em>three</em> identical PPU fetches, you could use it to increment a scanline counter.<br /><br />Sorry about my shenanigans, I wasn't seeing this information on the wiki.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Tue Nov 12, 2013 11:31 am</p><hr />

Well, the other thing is, I don't know if we can trust the two garbage fetches that occur with the sprite tile fetches. Technically, the behavior of them is undefined. If the garbage fetches are indeed because the nametable fetching circuitry is being reused for fetching the sprite tiles, then I would assume that the first and second fetches are <em>not</em> going to be the same, because it makes sense to me that the second fetch is always going to be an &quot;attribute&quot; fetch, and going to be computed from the current X and Y, and it's always going to fall in the range of an attribute table.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Mon Nov 11, 2013 10:44 pm</p><hr />

I'm wondering if it'd be easiest to count how many times PPU A13 cycles. It seems like it'd be very reliable because it's a guarantee that A13 will cycle on and off for each tile that needs to be fetched, including sprites, and it will always cycle the same amount of times for each scanline. As a bonus, this can also drive a scanline counter, because you'd need to be able to detect new scanlines anyway, whether it be through counting how many tiles were fetched, or using the multiple-read marker that MMC5 uses.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Mon Nov 11, 2013 10:20 pm</p><hr />

Poked around a bit in Visual 2C02, and it looks like attribute fetches are indeed only done for BG tiles. The &quot;fetch attribute byte&quot; signal is <strong>+hpos_eq_0-255_or_320-335_and_hpos_mod_8_eq_2_or_3_and_rendering</strong>, i.e. &quot;fetching background tile and in the attribute byte position&quot;. Need to fix this is in my emu too, as I had assumed one of the dummy NT fetches for sprites would be an AT fetch. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><br /><br />The &quot;fetch nametable byte&quot; signal is &quot;NOT fetching attribute byte AND NOT fetching the high or low tile byte&quot;, so for sprites it should be two consecutive NT fetches like you said.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5911">ulfalizer</a> — Sun Nov 10, 2013 11:12 pm</p><hr />

An interesting note is that the MMC5 can determine the absolute screen position of fetched BG tiles, as that's how the split position is specified in vertical split mode. The coarse x and y scroll can be set to whatever, and the split still ends up in the same location.<br /><br />That alone would make me suspect that it's simply counting nametable or tile fetches to determine when BG and sprite tiles are being fetched, but it seems odd that 8x8 vs 8x16 sprites would make any difference in that case. It would also need some way to synchronize to the frame.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5911">ulfalizer</a> — Sun Nov 10, 2013 10:28 pm</p><hr />

I was once again thinking about a hypothetical mapper that would tell whether BG tiles or Sprite tiles were being displayed, and automatically do bankswitching so sprites get two whole pattern tables.<br /><br />Let me know if I have this right.  It seems like the way to detect such a transition is to look for two consecutive reads to the nametable, and that enters &quot;Sprite Mode&quot;, and then when you have a read of the attribute table, return to &quot;Background Mode&quot;.  According to the Nintendulator source code, the Garbage AT fetch is the same address as the Garbage NT fetch, so if they are both reads to the nametable instead of the attribute table, you know you're rendering sprites.  Likewise, if anything gets fetched from the attribute table, you know you're rendering background tiles.  I'll assume nobody's doing any negative scrolling.<br /><br />The end of a scanline also has two consecutive nametable fetches, and that might trigger a bankswitch to Sprite Mode, but then there's an attribute table fetch right after that, so you'd switch back to Background Mode.<br /><br />Is this the simplest way to detect BG vs Sprite tiles?<br /><br />edit: Looks like you don't even need two consecutive reads, just switch to &quot;sprite mode&quot; on any nametable read, and &quot;bg mode&quot; on any attribute table read.<br /><br />Or in address line notation:<br />A13 &amp; A9 &amp; A8 &amp; A7 &amp; A6  (reading attribute table)<br />A13 &amp; !(A9 &amp; A8 &amp; A7 &amp; A6)  (reading nametable)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Sun Nov 10, 2013 8:32 pm</p><hr />
