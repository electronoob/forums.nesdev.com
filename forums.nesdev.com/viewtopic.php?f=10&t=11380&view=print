Also, I have a .chr file that I use to draw tiles and I would like to make it bigger so it will hold more banks than just the 256 sprite and 256 background. I compile using NESASM3 if that makes a difference.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It all depends on the mapper - the NES-CNROM-* board (iNES mapper 3) can support up to 32KB, the MMC1 (mapper 1) can handle up to 128KB natively, and the MMC5 (mapper 5) can handle 1MB. If you're designing your own mapper, you can theoretically make it as big as you want, but a standard .NES file (non-V2) will max out at just below 2MB.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you're still deciding what mapper you're gonna use, you have to consider the type of CHR switching you want to do. If you want to swap the whole 8KB at once, CNROM is the best option. With just one mapper write you select a different 8KB page of CHR (you can have up to 4 pages, or 32KB). CNROM doesn't expand PRG-ROM at all though, it's still limited to 32KB. More complex mappers will allow you to swap CHR in smaller pieces. For example, the MMC1 has 2 4KB slots (so you can swap sprites and background independently), MMC3 has 2 2KB slots and 4 1KB slots, and more complex mappers can do 8 1KB slots, which is as fine as it gets.<br /><br />If you don't need instantaneous CHR bankswitching, you should also consider CHR-RAM. CHR-RAM means that the 8KB used for tiles are empty when the program starts, and the program is free to write whatever it needs to it (using $2006/$2007, just like with name table and palette writes). This will allow you to rewrite any portion of the pattern tables you want, down to a single byte if you want to. The disadvantage of CHR-RAM is that updating it takes time (the time used for LDA'ing and STA'ing each byte times the number of bytes), while CHR-ROM bankswitching is instantaneous. This means that CHR-RAM updates are not suited for a complex title screen with more than 512 tiles, only instantaneous bankwitching halfway through the screen will give you that. However, if you plan to update the tiles only between levels and can afford to go a couple of frames with rendering turned off, CHR-RAM is a great (and simple) option.

It may show you the current scanline number (1 scanline = 113.67 cycles) or the number of cycles since the last breakpoint (helpful with breakpoints at the start and end of vblank wait).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">How can I expand the size of the CHR file I use so that it will hold more than the original 4KB of tile data?</div><br />That depends on several things. First, how are you creating this CHR file? Second, how you organize the tile data in CHR ROM depends on what you want to display at the same time. Show mock screenshots throughout the game and we might be able to recommend something. Third, you can include extra CHR ROM as extra banks after the PRG ROM, but how you actually use the data in those banks depends on the mapper you choose.

I can see three reasons why saves might not be saved:<br /><ul><li>Some emulators might not support saving with mapper 0, despite that configuration having been used for <em>Family BASIC</em>. </li><li>You may first need to tell the emulator where to put the .sav file. Some emulators assume that the folder containing the ROM is read-only, such as when the ROM is in a shared folder that multiple users on your computer can read but not write, or when it's on a CD or DVD. </li><li>Some emulators name .sav files based on a hash of the ROM contents, which makes your saves inaccessible after you have rebuilt your program.

Words like &quot;MMC3&quot; in &quot;bank style&quot; need to become links to the MMC3 document/relevant mapper, etc. so that people can cross-reference what's what.  Some of the formatting needs to be made consistent (ex. <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">16 + 16F</tt> vs. <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">16+16F</tt> (note spacing), same for <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">TLSROM,TKSROM</tt> (again spacing)).  The columns &quot;PRG bank size&quot; and &quot;CHR bank size&quot; should also have their unit specified in the column (ex. <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">PRG bank size &#40;kB&#41;</tt>) else they're just arbitrary numbers.<br /><br />Although I'll say this: I have no idea what &quot;F&quot; or &quot;R&quot; means, ex. 16+16F vs. 16F+16 vs. 2+6R, so a legend may be needed as well.<br /><br />For ridiculous mappers that are designed by crazy idiots and consist of 9 billion things intermixed: best to just make a separate page for those mappers (or use the hopefully-existing iNES_Mapper_XXX wiki page) and clarify things there with a single row in the table saying &quot;See {link to thingus}&quot;.<br /><br />The page needs to be clear/concise to people who want a general overview of overall capabilities and not something with insane amounts of detail; what you have in &quot;Comments&quot; works great for a sort of &quot;extra capabilities&quot; line, ex. &quot;Scanline IRQ, expansion audio&quot;, and that shouldn't get too out of control (mapper 5 / MMC5 is a good example of where it gets ridiculous).  For example, I wouldn't want the page to end up looking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_clients" class="postlink">like this clusterfuck on Wikipedia</a> where you totally lose track of where you are + there are multiple tables for multiple things where one program is in one table but not another due to negligence on the part of the editor.  TL;DR -- One mapper per row, one table.  If you want me to start the page + design the existing template/layout, I can do that.
