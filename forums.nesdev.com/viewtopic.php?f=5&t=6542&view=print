Where it takes a text file and just assembles it? Thats all I need it to do but everything out there is either  a suite that costs tons of $$$$ or is just super stupid and you have to get stuff from 10 sites and 3 different torrents. I just can't find a C++ compiler for free that works and is easy to understand. Can anyone help with this? This is kinda making me mad how hard it is to find any tools for windows programing -.-

<br />Visual c++ express is bloated and huge, but has great debugging features.
<br />For GCC, you usually want to get Mingw.

<br />If you want something really tiny, try TCC, the tiny C compiler.

<br />
<br />I just started using C for windows programming recently, and it's been pretty good.  I got SDL.dll (Simple Directmedia Layer) working pretty easily, for audio output.  I also ending up having to install VC++ Express though, to compile another DLL I wanted to use.

<br />That's what I use for my support applications (tile compressors, level encoders, table generators, etc). It really is easy to use, because it's so small and doesn't have to be installed you can really use it as easily as NESASM or ASM6. For me this is a must, since I develop in a lot of different machines and can't go installing/configuring stuff in all of them. It doesn't do C++ though, just C. For me this is not a problem.

<br />Ugh.
<br />
<br />Typing that crap is for chumps and masochists.  Sure it's easy when you have one file... but how many projects are only 1 file.  And what about optimization options, etc.
<br />
<br />Get an IDE.  Writing the code is hard enough.  Having to write more code to get your other code to compile is ridiculous.  Let the IDE sort all of that crap out.
<br />
<br />I highly recommend Visual Studio.  There are free versions available.
<br />
<br />If VS isn't your thing, there's also:
<br />
<br />- Code::Blocks (which I use on Ubuntu -- it's pretty decent)
<br />- Eclipse (which I think primarily is for Java, but I hear it has pretty good C++ support too.  Personally I haven't tried it)
<br />- a bunch of others.  Google 'free C++ IDE Windows'.  Just stay away from archaic and outdated versions of Dev-C++.

<br />
<br />I use <a href="http://www.contexteditor.org/" class="postlink">ConTEXT</a> for it, the same editor I use for NES stuff.  In that program, under Environment Options / Execute Keys you can set it up to compile with any options you want, also check "capture console output" and it will show the console output from the compiler (and maybe your program too if you launch it from there).
<br />
<br />I was already annoyed a little with VC++ Express 10, it changed my .asm/.c/.h file associations without asking me, causing a couple accidental launches and having to see the explorer window lock up while all the bloat loads.  Compared to any project in ConTEXT, which loads up instantly (it's still just a text editor, of course).

<br />ho hum.
<br />
<br />I haven't used VS since VS2002, but it didn't load any slower than Firefox does for me now (and I'm on a faster computer than I was back then).
<br />
<br />But yeah.  You're right.  There's going to be load time.  Is that really "bloat" though?  Or is that just more minimalist slander?  ;P

<br />I meant that if you are making simple programs (converters, table generators, etc) using IDEs might be overkill, not that the IDEs are simple programs. Sorry if that wasn't clear.
<br />
<br />Yeah, I absolutely hate bloatware, and will try to avoid it as much as possible. I do like to use tools that make my job easier (at home I use Notepad++ for coding 6502 for example), but I don't like to depend on them, so I make sure I can still just pick any random PC and use crappy old Notepad for the same purpose, without having to worry about what's installed and what's not.
<br />
<br />It may seem like a strange scenario for some people, but a while ago I used to have access to a lot of different PCs, like at work, college, family members' places, and by keeping this minimalistic approach I could always squeeze some development time out of busy days.

For C/C++, it's not perfect but there is no perfect IDE for that (too hard to parse C/C++ code) but the debugger is quite good.  Remote debugging an IIS 7 process is a breeze. Still didn't figure out how to do the same thing with apache/eclipse on linux thought (...).
<br />
<br />If you do C/C++ on win32 platform, you should use VS since the debugger is worth it.  For just compiling stuff, GCC is more than enough.

<br />
<br />I guess GCC/G++ allows both, but I have issues with this :
<br />- I have no idea how to acess your hard disk, which is required for anything NES-developement related (I had so many courses where they tell us to do a lot of very complex things and NEVER ACESS HARD DISK)
<br />- When you have an error in C++ code, it's just INSANE to find where it's located and where to fix it. The error messages form G++ (and likely GCC too, although I never used it much) does make absoultely NO sense if you're not an experienced computer science PHD.
<br />
<br />So I mostly use Java. I have to have a lot of shit folders in my eclipse folder for every project and I don't like it but it works.

<br />I'm interested. I plan to write some kind of sound engine that would be cross-platform compatible, and an interesting thing would be to make a PC version of it (so I get almost infinite processing power) - but it could be ported to all kinds of systems with much lower hardware (with the same concepts).
<br />Although I had Java, C++, and Delphi courses, they never told us how to play any sound (and I only know how to acess the hard disk in java...)

<br />I sure do. I use portable applications whenever possible, but unfortunately it not always is.
<br />
<br />Note that I'm not saying that IDEs are the devil and everybody should use Notepad (I use IDEs depending on what I'm doing), but given the context, the OP probably wants to code supporting applications for console development, so I figured that a small and simple compiler would be more than suitable. But if he wishes to do more than that and say, code an emulator, by all means, use the bloated IDE of your choice.
