		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This little thing has been bothering me for some time now, so I though I should try to get to the bottom of it. It's a bit hard to explain, but basically it's a one pixel/scanline tall, variable length line of &quot;glitchyness&quot; that appear seemingly completely randomly during SMB gameplay, about once a minute on average on my AV Famicom. However, it only happens on some &quot;runs&quot; of the game. Power cycling the system can either make it appear or go away. It also appears in SMB2 for the Disk System in the same manner.<br />I've been looking on the internet for real hardware videos of SMB showing this and it's not easy to find anything, but here is what I got:<br /><br />First is this niconico video of some guy playing Mario blindfolded:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm17492296">http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm17492296</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nicozon.net/watch/sm17492296">http://www.nicozon.net/watch/sm17492296</a><!-- m --> (no account needed)<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nicozon.net/downloader.html?video_id=sm17492296">http://www.nicozon.net/downloader.html? ... sm17492296</a><!-- m --> (download link page)<br />6:45~6:49 you can clearly see it around the middle of the screen.<br />Again at 7:02.<br /><br />Second, this shaky video of a US NES playing back a TAS:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1Ps1O6sZX4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1Ps1O6sZX4</a><!-- m --><br />1:10, you can see it above the &quot;WELCOME TO WARP ZONE&quot; text.<br />3:05, above the castle.<br /><br />So...what is going on here? Of course no emulator does this. Does this ever happen on your NES/Famicom? What causes it?<br /><br />For all I know this has been discussed before, but googling this kind of thing is, of course, impossible.<br /><br />(I wasn't sure which subforum to post this in, by the way)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It always seems to happen close to a screen transition (when entering a warp, when a level has been finished), so I'm going to guess that it's an artifact from doing <em>something</em> with PPU (e.g. turning off rendering momentarily) when the rendering happens to be in the middle of the screen. Hard to say what exactly, but doppel's SMB disassembly should have the answer. Might be hard to find though if it's not reproducible.<br /><br />Technically I don't see a reason why it shouldn't also happen on emulators.

I can't think of any reason at the moment why that line should be occurring at all, since the only time anything is written to the PPU during display is after a sprite #0 hit is detected.  And that happens farther up the screen.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't think this glitch is exclusive to Super Mario Bros. I'm actually the one who made that second shaky video, and I think the glitch is not code related at all, but power related. Specifically, tiny dips in the supply voltage combined with an oxidized cartridge slot mean the PPU will read incorrect data for a few bytes. That Super Mario Bros. cartridge I was using is fairly temperamental even after cleaning, it needs to be jiggled around in the slot several times to work without showing horizontal or vertical glitchy lines. <br /><br />I should recreate the recording setup I used there and try to get a less shaky video, but I would want to port the code to the new ARM Launchpad and I haven't gotten around to it. I never got it to work with any other TAS but Super Mario Bros. because I only had room for 6 minutes of controller data on the chip, and streaming more from the PC would eventually cause a missed controller interrupt and desync.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My theory is that the issue has to do with bad pin/edge connector contact.<br /><br />As has been discussed here on nesdev many times over, both the classic slot-loader NES, the Famicom, and the top-loader NES all have problems relating to cartridge connection (I will be a dick and state boldly that anyone who tells you otherwise is flat out wrong); this has plagued the console since its existence.  Sometimes jostling/wobbling can cause a single pin to lose contact (or possibly still have contact but the signal is not as strong) which can cause anomalies of sorts; the results would vary depending upon what the entire system (CPU, PPU, and all other circuitry) was doing at that moment in time (we're talking microseconds here).  Such jostling/wobbling could be caused by wiggling of the controller cord, or even stomping of feet against a floor (vibration going up through the table, etc.).  Naturally every environment/situation is different, thus troubleshooting this is impossible.  The older the carts (dirty/damaged contacts), the older the console (more worn the edge connector), the worse it gets -- even slot-loading NESes with new/replaced edge connectors have this problem (sometimes the edge connector is too tight, as crazy as that sounds).<br /><br />This would also explain why such anomalies are not seen using emulators but only actual hardware.<br /><br />Power-related issues, sure -- I can't refute that possibility.  But please apply Occam's razor first.<br /><br />P.S. -- I seriously don't know what it is about the NES/Famicom that drives OCD people to it.  I have found this to be the case for decades now; you won't find the quantity of OCD people with any other console.  It's utterly creepy.  I don't know why things like &quot;strange anomalies&quot; (see OP), blowing on cartridge connectors, turning the console upside-down, etc. can't just be considered part of the whole actual experience of using the console.  I had to do such in the late 80s/early 90s, so why is this such a big deal to people now?  *shakes head*

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I actually replicated this, with a completely different NES, TV, and cartridge in a different city. The glitch is only really visible in certain areas of World 1-2. It also only seems to appear 1/3rd of the time when the console is powered on. Once it's doing it, resetting won't make it stop but powering on/off will. Maybe it only happens on one of the CPU/PPU clock alignments? Uninitialized RAM? Who knows.<br /><br />And as for why to be OCD about this, it's because the NES is a quirky system and this is a forum full of people who want to emulate those quirks.

My absolute firm belief is that it's something physical or electrical, and is not a &quot;quirk&quot; or &quot;characteristic&quot; of the CPU or PPU (thus cannot be emulated, but I've been wrong before) because what I see in those videos looks like brief &quot;video signal noise&quot;, and it's something I've seen on consoles as well as some arcades.  If there is a reliable way to reproduce it (&quot;reproduce&quot; means at least 90% reproducible as consistently as possible), someone with an oscilloscope could probe different spots of the video circuitry (this is not necessarily the PPU itself) and see if they can figure out what's happening.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To make it a little easier to see, I downloaded the capture from NND and isolated the frames where the glitch occurs. Note: frame numbers may or may not be slightly inaccurate, as I merely threw the .mp4 file into a barebones Avisynth script using DirectShowSource and loaded it into Virtualdub, and I noticed that I didn't seem to seek accurately on my machine when scrubbing backwards then forwards again. Still, here you go:<br /><br /><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/localh/marioglitch/smile-12172.png" alt="Image" /><br />Frame 12172<br /><br /><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/localh/marioglitch/smile-12238.png" alt="Image" /><br />Frame 12238<br /><br /><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/localh/marioglitch/smile-12657.png" alt="Image" /><br />Frame 12657<br /><br /><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/localh/marioglitch/smile-12797.png" alt="Image" /><br />Frame 12797<br /><br />I find it intriguing that the instances of the glitch in close succession seem to always be on the same scanline, and also seem to pull from the same tile data:<br /><br /><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/localh/marioglitch/smile-12172.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/localh/marioglitch/smile-12238.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/localh/marioglitch/smile-12657.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/localh/marioglitch/smile-12797.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The glitching also seems to have both a vertical and horizontal offset, and once again even though it seems to be different between the two &quot;sets&quot; of frames, it seems to be the same within each &quot;set&quot;, and it also seems to be bringing in the other half of the nametable, as with the first set I can easily tell that the righthand &quot;floating&quot; glitch is a sliver of the coins, and when sliding those pixels down to the coins in Photoshop, they don't line up with the normal tiles on the left hand of the screen, however as most of us probably know there are single-wide blocks approximately four blocks to the right of the edge of the screen, which are visible in the second glitch set (and in that set, the two-block-wide glitch to the left of Mario may either be the blocks he's right next to but at a different y-pos, or the two-block-wide column just off the right hand side of the screen that contains a multi-coin block).<br /><br />Whether this visual analysis helps or not, I dunno. Seems like the glitching is at least a bit deterministic, however.

That was possibly even more deterministic than this, however.
