I think it's better to separate both so you can minimize your Sprite size object for your sprites functions.

The hard part is having so many different animation combinations of every move, plus each shooting direction.  This might sound really hacky, but I think I'll make a subroutine that takes the current &quot;metasprite request&quot; register, compares it with a bunch of possible values, and replace the data with corresponding &quot;while shooting&quot; variant.

Even though its not directly relevant it has that &quot;wow&quot; factor and says: &quot;This guy can LEARN HARD THINGS.&quot; in spades.

What jobs would I be able to get?</div><br />I can't make any guarantees for anybody, but my expectation is that you may be able to get in to an entry level software engineering job. Given your experience with assembly, you could probably pick up java or C# or php or what not on the job. Entry level positions often don't care that much if you have a lot of depth of experience in the specific field they are hiring for. I didn't know a lick of C# when I got my first job, I did know a tiny bit of C and BASIC though and could show them personal projects I made. They were just happy to see I was eager to learn and that I was able to program, period. Employers vary a lot in their interview style. If you can find one who is interested in seeing your personal projects, it should be impressive to many of them. The type of work available out there is typically something kinda sorta boring maybe? Involving forms and databases and what not, but it can be interesting work if you have the right attitude.<br /><br />There's all kinds of other types of work out there too, you may wish to seek additional advice on this matter wherever you can find it. After all I don't know very much about you personally except what you've chosen to share here on this forum.

It seems that at as time goes by and we become more experienced, our enthusiasm decreases for whatever reason.</div><br />Man this is quite an understatement... Since a couple of years or so I am so incapable of programming anything even simple that I feel mentally disabled whenever I try, which leads to a vicious circle of not being motivated to program anymore, etc...<br /><br />And this is coming from someone who just used to love programming as a hobby a couple of years ago.</div>This is the Snr Coders dilemma. <br />What you love about coding, is working out and solving problems. When you are jr everything is something that needs to be worked out and you spend more time on the problem than you do on the making a .h/.cpp file, writing the docs, pushing pull things of a stack, working out which bank to put it in etc all the &quot;leg work&quot;.. as you get more experienced, solving the problem becomes easier and easier till you hit the point where you know how to do it all, and you spend a few minutes on the problem but the legwork doesn't change, so now the fun to leg ratio is 1:100 when before it was 3:2</div><br /><br />It seems to me one can continuously increase the scope and complexity of what one is working on, augmenting the challenge of what one has achieved previously. Programming/game development can be made arbitrarily hard if one is feeling bored. I think about my dad, who has been a math professor since 1970, he still hasn't retired and still has new challenges. I feel programming/game development can be the same way, it's all about attitude.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I do get the fun to legwork ratio thing, but I don't agree that the legwork didn't change... the truth is that I didn't care about the boring stuff at all when I was younger! As long as the on-screen results were good, I couldn't care less about how things were under the hood. Everything was fun because everything immediately translated into on-screen results. As I got older, I started caring about standards and good practices, and only then did the legwork become a problem.
