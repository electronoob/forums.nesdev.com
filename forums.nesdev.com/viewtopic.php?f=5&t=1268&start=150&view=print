<br />
<br />I went through a few chance encounters that convinced me to rely on Mach Rider to check 4017 support.
<br />
<br />Super Smash Bros. Melee has a mach rider track that, unless I'm mistaken, is based on the original song. It would make sense to rely on the notes from that 1 song, because it encompasses both songs I use to check the accuracy of 4017 emulation in the NSF. The emulator I used to fix the rip plays it essentially the same way as the SSBM track.
<br />
<br />Because the .NSF is so picky, and relies on such weird things to make it function properly, it's actually a good test of certain emulated functions.

<br />A GBS file is written in Z80 bytecode. A NSF file is written in 6502 bytecode. And even if you do manage to port the music engine to the NES, the Game Boy's configurable 32-step wavetable channel would be replaced with a constant 0123456789ABCDEFFEDCBA9876543210.

<br />
<br />As for GSFLib options, it runs fine in BGB, and not in a GBA emulator, it's probably the 2-layered emulation going on. a GBS, converted to .GB, appended to the Goomba GB emulator, played in a GBA emulator. Up until the point it's attached to Goomba, it should be alright. Goomba isn't perfect, so that muddles the results a bit.
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />Actually, it turns out that Goomba Color has been updated since I last checked. Goomba Color makes a GSF set sound nearly tolerable to listen to for Zelda OOA, and I didn't really hear much wrong with a fresh MM2 GBS2GSF set. I replaced the existing GBS2GSF pack with the new goomba, but you can use any goomba file you think you'd like to.
