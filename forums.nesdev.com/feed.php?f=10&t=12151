I just want to vote for asm6.  It is quite easy to use... cause the person who wrote it is a grand wise genius!  He wrote it because he couldn't find a good assembler to use... and I'm so happy he wrote it!  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  It is free and very useable... it just works over and over and over again.

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />looks like it exports to nes, snes and tons more. Has anyone ever used this before? Anyone have any feedback on this?<br /></div><br />Yes I can. WLA-DX is a pretty nice assembler with tons of features. The 6502 version of it is great, with the exeption that it can't decide between zero-page and absolute addressing for you, so you have to default to one and add &quot;.b&quot; or &quot;.w&quot; suffixes when you use the other (if you don't default you'll have to always use suffixes).<br /><br />Do not use the SPC700 version however, it's buggy as hell and doesn't assemble what you tell it to. The author (Vile Helin) seems not to be working on the assembler anymore and nobody took the development of it, so it seems the project is dead, and that you won't get any bugfixes or updates in the future, which is a problem.<br /><br />Command line programs are pretty much the sole alternative when it comes to compiling programs. I don't remember having any compiler or assembler with GUI, at best you have a GUI who calls the command line program. I personally prefer to use the command line as much as possible, because of it's simplicity and universality (which computer can't have a command line ? Ok, many embedded systems can't, but you see my point).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Dec 31, 2014 3:22 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Erockbrox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />if you dont enter something in EXACTLY it doesnt work.<br /></div><br />Computers are stupid. It's much, much harder to make a stupid machine find mistakes and correct them automatically than it is to require smart humans to type commands precisely. If you were on the other side, programming command line software, you'd be complaining about the users who aren't clear about what they want to do and thus can't get the software to work.<br /><br />Keep in mind that assembly language in general is way more anal than any command line tool you can think of. The NES (or any other console for that matter) is completely unforgiving of any mistakes you make. The NES doesn't know what games are, it's just a machine that draws pictures and makes sounds if you give it the correct orders. This means that in order to make a game you have to simulate everything that constitutes a game yourself (physics, collisions, A.I, animations, etc. - the NES doesn't know about any of that), and tell the NES EXACTLY how it must display the pictures and make the sounds based on your game calculations.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />ive had to take screen shots of me entering in the correct spacing and correct syntax<br /></div><br />You could have used the time you spent taking screenshots making batch files instead.

When you're assembling a game for example, there are several assets that need to be prepared to be included in the ROM. Imagine if I was creating a new level, editing graphics, palettes, level layout and object placement all at once... if each of those needed a different GUI to convert the data into binaries I can include in my game, I'd have to do an awful lot of clicking every time I wanted to test any changes. With command line tools I can just script all the conversions one after the other and have the ROM ready in seconds just by double-clicking a single batch file.<br /><br />So yeah, if it's a task I just want to get done once I'll surely prefer a GUI that allows me to get the job done in a few clicks, but if it's a part of a project that will have to be compile/assembled thousands of times I'd much rather script the whole thing once and forget about this process.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Dec 30, 2014 7:30 pm</p><hr />

Assembling is something you want to do tons of times to test so that you know what works and what doesn't work with your code. As Tepples said in such cases batch scripting is saving you tons of time and sweat, and a command-line program is perfect for that.<br /><br />Personally I use Notepad++ and the standard NppExec plugin with a very simple script to automate everything. You just press F6 then enter, and the file is saved, assembled, linked, patched (if applicable) and finally launched in an emulator with good debugging so that you can immediately see the result. The only thing I'm missing is a program that converts PNG files to CHR files that I can include in the automation process.<br /><br />If you think ca65 is too much for you, ASM6 is very easy to use and there are <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=6160" class="postlink">templates</a> and <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=12097" class="postlink">ASM6 versions of the excellent Nerdy Nights guide</a> so it's easy to get started with.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6013">Pokun</a> — Tue Dec 30, 2014 6:49 pm</p><hr />

okay guys. I actually do know how to use command line programs (most of the time) but its the tedious text entering that I dont like. for example if you dont enter something in EXACTLY it doesnt work. <br /><br />if you know there are really old versions of MAME (arcade emulator) and getting that to work in the command line is a bi*ch. the syntax has to be perfect. you have to manually tell the program the file destination of the rom then you have to tell it the correct commands like mame -battletoads - playback recording or some crap like that. if you get anything wrong it doesnt work. <br /><br />ive had to take screen shots of me entering in the correct spacing and correct syntax just so i can reference these screen shots because i usually mess up the commands and cant get it to work. <br /><br />i like lunar ips. its an easy gui program that patches roms. which is better, having to manually type in a complicated file destination of where a rom is located and where the patch is located or just easily search or it and click on it? the worst part about file destinations is that if you have a rom thats like in several folders it becomes a mess to type in. example:<br /><br />destop/user/folder of games/folder of nintendo games/folder of snes games/folder of roms/folder of roms that start with letter S/super mario world.smc<br /><br />you want to manually type that in on a command line program twice just to patch something?

<div class="quotetitle">Erockbrox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Why can't it be a simple GUI program?<br /></div><br />GUIs add a lot of bloat to a program that would otherwise perform a simple task (convert source files into binary images). Instead of a standalone small file you end up with something several MBs large that needs to be installed and depends on a bunch of runtime libraries that also need to be downloaded and installed. Sounds awfully unnecessary to me.<br /><br />Just because a program is operated from the command line that doesn't mean you have to type a lot of stuff every time you use it. Like koitsu and mikaelmoizt said, you can create a batch file (a text file with the .bat extension with the commands you want to execute written in it), and simply double click that file every time you need to assemble. Just be sure to put a &quot;pause&quot; command at the end of the batch file to prevent the command window from closing immediately, otherwise you won't be able to read the messages the assembler outputs (such as error messages which really help locating mistakes in your code).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Dec 30, 2014 3:02 pm</p><hr />

The WLA DX documentation is vast and simultaneously horrible (not because of its size, but rather just because the quality and wording is atrocious -- I still have yet to successfully assemble anything with it simply because the documentation is so bad).<br /><br /><a href="https://home.comcast.net/~olimar/NES/" class="postlink">asm6</a> and ca65/cc65 are the most prominent two you'll find mentioned here.<br /><br />ca65 has a significantly higher learning curve and a lot of hullabaloo that I've never felt was necessary (mainly the templating crap), but the majority of folks here prefer it.<br /><br />If you want to use something that has good community support (i.e. people here can help you), use either asm6 or ca65.  If you aren't sure which to try, try both -- they're both standalone programs that don't require installation (you just drop them into a single directory and you're done), so if you don't like one you just delete the folder and that's it.<br /><br />You're going to need to overcome your fear of command-line programs.  And It's a fairly ridiculous fear given the platform you plan on developing for.  You're going to be doing a lot of typing writing assembly code, not a lot of clicking with a mouse.  You can write a Windows batch/cmd file that assembles the program (makes a .NES ROM) <strong>once</strong> and never have to edit it again.  The key part of this paragraph is this: if you're just starting out, you're going to have a single source code file for your entire program, and maybe a single .chr file for your pattern table/graphics and that's about it.  You don't need an IDE for that.  The last thing that should be on your mind is an IDE right now -- what should be on your mind is learning 6502 assembly and learning how the NES actually works (particularly the PPU).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Tue Dec 30, 2014 12:27 pm</p><hr />

I found an assembler here<br /><br /><a href="http://www.villehelin.com/wla.html" class="postlink">http://www.villehelin.com/wla.html</a><br /><br />looks like it exports to nes, snes and tons more. Has anyone ever used this before? Anyone have any feedback on this?<br /><br />thanks<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6785">Erockbrox</a> — Tue Dec 30, 2014 11:20 am</p><hr />
