Since he's got his listing on ebay already he will be too scared to have the sale messed up and might bring the rom to be programmed again. You don't have much to lose. You could fix your mistake in an hilarious way imo.

While I agree with 3gengames that what you did was a very stupid and you didn't put too much thought into it, there is no point of saying more as it is already done.

I also don't have SNES programming experience, but I am one of the people here that do have the skills to do something, I've got 1 full NES game and a few test ROMS under my belt more than you, so what have you brought to the table since you're doing much more than me? I'd love to see it. I'm not trolling, I'm just saying you have no idea what you're doing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Pichichi010, why did you edit and delete all the info about you burning the proto rom for the scammer and the fake proto auction?! It make the thread impossible to understand for people that just came in and also, I told you I had made a warning post on another forum that was pointing here, now it just look stupid. God
<br />
<br />I'm annoyed, you even managed to make your warning post at nintendo age confusing for some people. With one reply from one of their member saying ''Man that sucks! I'm not a big proto guy but a Steven Seagal proto? I'm in <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> '' Why don't you clearly state the name of the proto in the subject title of your post, then clearly explain that the guy asked you to burn eprom with the proto rom on it, that you were stupid enough to think he was legit and did as he asked without thinking much about the implication, he then slapped them on a proto board and sell it as the genuine Final Option PCB. I think that you're almost generating publicity for the guy with the confusing post you made and the fact that you removed the original content from that thread. And on top of that you are replying to your thread asking to make the post private? What the hell?
<br />
<br />You made a big stupid mistake, now handle it properly instead of piling up more crap on the mess you created <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> Continue acting that way and I reckon you won't find anymore people willing to answer your post or help you with anything here. I know at least I and some other already won't be helping you with anything NAND flash, repro or eprom related anytime soon.
<br />
<br />Edit: OMG, you're reaching new height Pachichi010, why did you delete all the text in your Nintendo Ages warning post?! I really can't believe all the moronic decision you're making.

Don't ask me why he edited his post; I edit my posts all the time (usually seconds after I post them, I'm horrible about detecting typos/mistakes until AFTER I've clicked post, hahaha).
<br />
<br />Regardless, *I* can't even follow what's going on in this thread any longer.  *laugh*  :-)  As such, and given that people are kinda frustrated, I'm going to lock this one down.  Sorry guys.
