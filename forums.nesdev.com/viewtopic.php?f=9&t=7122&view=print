<br />SUROM is probably the most advanced mapper that can be replicated for sale without a donor cart. RetroZone has a board that can substitute for any common MMC1 board, including SUROM. But MMC1 doesn't have a scanline counter or a dedicated PRG bank slot for sampled sound playback, so you won't be able to do A. complex raster effects and sampled sound playback at once or B. lots of different samples (like a Sunsoft bass or Klax sound effects). These are generally considered MMC3 features; if you need them, and your game uses the same mapper configuration and ROM size as a game for which a reproduction guide exists, you can follow that guide.

<br />
<br />There is no reason if you were going to produce a new game that you couldn't put a MMC3 clone mapper on a CPLD. Given that RetroZone created the PowerPAK, and reproductions that don't use standard mappers, I don't think MMC3 is an issue for them.

<br />And yes, It's easier to order boards from RetroUSB and make nice carts without rewiring and such, so you can use them to save time and learn, then use donors that are easy to find/cheap/easy to find to make some other stuff to play around with. For NROM, I use just SMB, DH, Hockey carts. Easy to find, not expensive, PLENTIFUL, so I don't feel bad and they're going twords a good cause. As for MMC1, It's harder to find the right and cheap donor, so sometimes RetroUSB would be easier to obtain boards. (Like SXROM, No USA released game uses it)
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope this info helps.

<br />Sure, there are bigger flash chips than the 29F040 used by SUROM, but they aren't always 5.0 V 8-bit parallel NOR flash like the 29F series. A lot of big flash chips are 3.3 V, or I2C serial, or block-organized NAND. To use serial or block memory effectively, you need a big PRG RAM. FDS (disk is serial) and PowerPak (CF is a block device) do this, but I have my doubts that a game can.

<br />I'd worry about NROM first, with 32K program and 8K graphics. If your 1st game is over that, you might be getting a -tad- froggy.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> 
<br />
<br />
<br />And as for it, yeah it can be done, but you have to make/hack the hardware in and write games. I know I am making a 1MB SN2ROM (My name for it) for messing with a project next up in the future. It can be done, but sometimes is just better to get to this a lot later.

<br />
<br />Having an ideal setup, would require an ideal game for an example.
<br />
<br />I had completed 4 NES board designs (the 3 oldest ones are pictured <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/35865006@N00/1284712212/in/photostream/" class="postlink">here</a>), I have a couple more planned, one of them sooner, it's a pretty decent and should be pretty cheap.  Here's the (planned) specs:
<br />
<br />-PRG (FlashROM) $8000 and $C000 are banked independently, 512kB max.
<br />-CHR-RAM Is banked, also twice independently, at $0800-$0FFF and $1800-$1FFF. the rest is fixed. (16 * 2kB)
<br />-registers at $5000-$5007
<br />-(optional) WRAM is banked (4 * 8kB)
<br />
<br />The other one I'll be doing later (complete Squeedo redesign) will be pretty extreme in it's capabilities.. and will be more expensive, for it.

<br />I'm not sure what that means but im not asking about this stuff for my <em>first game</em>...im asking to keep my conceptual knowledge ahead of my technical knowledge so i know what direction to head in.
