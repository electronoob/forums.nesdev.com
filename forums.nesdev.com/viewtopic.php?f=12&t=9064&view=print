		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been working on a project to build an SNES cart board from scratch (no special chips, MAD-1 decoder), and the one thing that I've been putting off for last is the MAD-1 decoder.  I found neviksti's post in this thread <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4450&amp;sid=0a852e0496df6c70188b08a7cfd8eec6" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4450&amp;sid=0a852e0496df6c70188b08a7cfd8eec6</a> which gives me a really solid starting point, but I'm wondering, has anybody worked out a replacement for the MAD-1 (in both Lo and HiROM configurations) using in-production, off-the-shelf discrete logic parts?  Neviksti's post should be more than enough information to get me an answer, but my combinatorial logic analysis is a bit rusty, and I figure it's better to ask first (well, better to search on my own first, which I have, then ask) to see if anybody has already worked it out before I try to do it myself...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The Sanyo ROM appears to be discontinued, and I already have a better alternative in mind for SRAM (although it's a 3.3v part, so level shifting's gonna be a pain...).  I'm also looking into Micron FlashROMs which, although they are also 3.3v parts, they have a significantly large x8/x16 parallel Flash ROM line that goes up to 2Gbit, so they're not likely to go anywhere in the near future (I really want to source all in-production parts, otherwise I'd just use 29F032's).  A PIC12F629 works for the CIC key(SuperCIC key mode), and then I just need a decoder.  The one you posted is just a dual 2-to-4 decoder, which IIRC was used in some SNES carts (not positive it was the -139, I get all those 74xx parts mixed up...), but I really need to look into it more before I decide on a decoder.  Ideally, I'd really like a switchable decoder that can be simultaneously wired as HiROM and LoROM and easily switch between the two configurations, but I'm not sure how complicated that might be.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a feeling that the epoxy blob on your board is the decoder (in combination with the 139), so that board of yours is next to useless for design REing.  My board will be significantly smaller than the official ones anyway due to smaller chips, the lack of a battery, and better PCB tolerances.  Yes, I've seen that documentation.  It doesn't help me nearly as much as kyuusaku's logic table.  And no, I don't intend to implement that disgusting kludge they call a Lo/HiROM switch.  That's the nice part about designing something from scratch, you have the freedom to do it right instead of hacking something together from existing designs.

<br />
<br />I been working on this too,

<br />Would looking into N64 carts help?

<br />I know they saved on a flash memory.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No, N64 carts won't help.  They use a much more interesting method of multiplexing the address and data lines which is entirely unlike the SNES.  And yes, the 29F032's are obsolete as well, I was saying that if I were to use obsolete parts, that'd be my first choice.  As it is, the Micron parts I'm looking at are around $2 each for the 32Mbit chip or about $3.50 for 64Mbit (or $4 for 128Mbit, if I REALLY feel like overdoing it; it'd only really useful for the Star Ocean NoSDD-1 hack).  I need to sit down and combine all of what I know about the MAD-1 into a single, coherent document, most likely on paper (because paper just works better for me when I'm brainstorming), and then I'll see what I come up with in terms of the mapper.  I'm planning on a single ROM chip and no SRAM battery, so that should simplify things a bit...

<br />
<br />Well... I suppose that just because the pin isn't connected has no bearing on the logic for the pin, I just want to confirm the pin numbers.

<br />
<br />I have no reason to believe it isn't correct... I dumped the logic manually using a binary counter in maybe 15 minutes so you could always verify it with a similar technique.
<br />
<br />In this application there's absolutely no reason to implement the MAD-1 logic,  just grab the Lo/HiROM SRAM decoding.
<br />
<br />To support Lo/HiROM ROMs you need only some multiplexers to shift A[n:16] to A[n-1:A15].

On another tangent, I know that the old Mario Paint's used only a LS139 and another chip labeled D2145U to work the sram instead of Mad-1...maybe there is an alternative to whatever the D2145U is to control the sram state to make homebrew carts with sram+battery with a common '139?
