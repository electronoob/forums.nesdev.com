Anyone would try the game emulated first and buy if they really like it so they can get the extra material and a hard copy of the game.
<br />
<br />Also, I bet the high price goes to the material, not to the guy putting it together (can't be cheaper since the material is bough in small quantities). It would probably give more work to the guy rather than supporting him.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm reading over this entire thread and to start off, I am developing a commercial NES game with some friends.
<br />
<br />Honestly, I'm not surprised by these responses because we're in NESdev forums and not NintendoAge or NESWorld.  This forum consists of intelligent to highly intelligent developers and hackers who have little to no need for a consumer copy of products that they would more or less rather play on an emulator and dissect with hex editors, debuggers, and disassemblers when the game loses its OOB, hands-on interest or charm.
<br />
<br />Let's just say that I'm not interested in trying to make commercial games for money.  I have a regular job -- and I seriously suggest anyone trying to make money off such a niche market should do the same.
<br />
<br />The reason that we're trying to produce a hardware copy of the game is to try to up the standards of NES development to that of the AtariAge realm in which people come together in a community to share somewhat of a physical glamour of their products.  Products that could be sold at classic gaming expos or online to these niche collectors.  It's a very humble form of making your skills known and most importantly:  It allows others to dream to produce games in the same light.
<br />
<br />A new flood of quality, commercial NES games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Even the simplest NES homebrew would most likely qualify for a commercial Atari game on gameplay merits alone so it's hard to compare the two very different scenes. Anyways, Atari games were developed in 100s of man-hours, where NES games could take 1000s; that's why you don't see more commercial quality games, not because of something in the water.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I think you have a pretty good point there. The NES homebrew scene is sometimes compared to the Atari one. And the reason Atarti indeed does get more action is because the games are so much simpler, and many NES homebrews already released are in fact comparable to Atari games.
<br />
<br />However, when one thinks of a "NES game", different games come to mind, much more complex than the typical "1-screen puzzle game". And very often, programmers who start working on such complex projects abandon them at some point for various reasons: lack of motivation, the long time it takes, incompetence, whatever. If they had started simpler projects instead, they'd probably finish them, and there'd be a greater number of released NES homebrews.
<br />
<br />This is a pretty reasonable explanation of why it doesn't make much sense comparing the Atari scene to the NES scene.

<br />
<br />I see your point.  My intention, or dream if we can call it this way, is to be able to see products for the previous generation of console.  Since I'm a developer, not a business guy, my motivation has never been money in the first place.  But if it would work, and new articles would come for those once dead consoles, you do need money to make at least the project go on, create  new software and at least survive along the way.  
<br />
<br />But I would prefer if bigger company could get back an interest in it. But in today's market where no risk is taken, I don't thing any of them would do it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is only partially on-topic, but considering the massive popularity of "TV plug n' play" games, I am very surprised a <em>licensed</em> NES clone with built-in games hasn't been released. Imagine something like an old-school NES controller with AV cables, plastered with Mega Man artwork, containing the original 6 games (basically a much higher-quality Famiclone). They could release different models for different game series. You <em>know</em> something like that would require virtually no effort and sell like hotcakes, and it's been done officially before (see: Genesis clones, Atari Flashback 2), so why hasn't the NES received this treatment? I know that VC exists, and maybe that's why, but not everyone wants/can afford a Wii...
<br />
<br />(aside from that, it might give us hardware hackers a new source for improved NOACs <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's true.  We've been working on this game for around 6 months now and we're still only at around alpha stage 5.  (Unfortunately, I cannot and WILL NOT give any more information about the game and especially NO teasers or spoilers.  Spoilers spoil a game.)
<br />
<br />We're working diligently and slowly at this project while trying to remain active yet passive enough to allow for personal business between the three of us.
<br />
<br />As for tips for a good development team:
<br />
<br />1.)  A three man team is ideal.
<br />
<br />For us, we have a coder, musician, and artist.  Instead of doing a one man project, this allows for people to collaborate on which ideas are good or bad very quickly and add different spins on the game and original design.
<br />
<br />2.)  This really helps for distribution of wealth in the end.
<br />
<br />3.)  Work and responsibilities aren't as ambiguous.
<br />
<br />--
<br />
<br />As for cons, time is definitely still a factor.  It takes more time to communicate between 3 people than it does to be by yourself; but once communicated, work speed increases.
<br />
<br />Anyway, all that really matters is keeping your team motivated by good design, effort, reliability, fun, and trust.  Money is only an additional incentive.  Money doesn't make a good team.
