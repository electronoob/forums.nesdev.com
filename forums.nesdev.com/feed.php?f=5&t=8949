I'm trying to find a PC emulated NES games Konami bundle circa 2000.  I believe it was published by Konami of Hawaii.  It had Castlevania, Castlevania II, some others... Its games were in iNES format.  It also had a hidden Jackal ROM within the executable.  The reason why I'm asking is that the Castlevania II included within the bundle was entirely different than the revisions dumped and available at the time.  It had a totally different password scheme.  I believe I ripped the games back in 2002 and released them on Sardius' board.  If so they are probably somewhere within Cowering's GoodNES, but I cannot remember the original name of the bundle and wanted to do a little more research into how they acquired the alternate Castlevania II; (did they have code or did they dump a cartridge...?)<br /><br />Edit:  It's late and I found it myself.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/561575-konami-collectors-series-castlevania-and-contra/reviews/review-142057">http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/561575-konam ... iew-142057</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Wow... I didn't know someone mirrored portions of Sardius's Board.<br /><br />(Following code of conduct and not directly linking to game images.)<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.inverteddungeonDOTCOM/demoncastle/Konami%20Collector%27s%20Series%20-%20Castlevania%20&amp;%20Contra.htm">http://www.inverteddungeonDOTCOM/demonc ... Contra.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Edit 2:<br /><br />Also turns out that Castlevania II is an altered version of the European version and uses the same password system.  There are a lot of other differences in code as well.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3466">B00daW</a> â€” Sun May 27, 2012 11:19 pm</p><hr />
