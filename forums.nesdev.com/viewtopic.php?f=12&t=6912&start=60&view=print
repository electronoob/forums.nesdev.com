<br />You'll probably have to ask Shiru or someone else with inside knowledge about TFM Music Maker why it sounds out of tune.

<br />ADSR is of course different between different family chips, OPN and OPM have rsame parameters, but OPL has different and lower accuracy parameters and OPZ(stuff Yamaha use in their synthesizers) have higher accurqacy ones.

<br />
<br />The biggest difference between an original YM2612 and a very good emulator, like KEGA, is the aliasing distortion on the real chip. On my Rev. 1 Mega Drive (the one with the EXT connector on the back), when I listen to a tune via headphones, I can clearly make out a distortion effect when a waveform fades out. 
<br />
<br />This is probably because the on-chip DAC of the YM2612 has a very limited number of bits compared to the external Yamaha YM3012/3014 DAC's used with most of their FM chips. So far, no emulator gets this correctly. Most people using the Emulator would probably complain once this characteristic of the original chip is implemented. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />I have played a lot with FM, and it's really like tweaking a real music instrument. It's so easy to screw up, making it sound distorted and shrill, which is probably the reason why lots of MD/GEN tunes don't sound very good. But once, in the hands of a composer who knows this stuff, it can sound really awesome!

<br />Games like Blaster Master and Faxanadu look better on an NTSC TV than on a PlayChoice; this helped popularize NTSC TV emulation in emulators such as Nestopia. Tunes exploiting nontrivial quirks of the BRR decoder for noise generation did the same for SNES DSP emulation. So if we want to popularize accurate emulation of an FM chip's artifacts, perhaps someone needs to make a tune that sounds better on a Genesis than on the current emulators.
<br />
<br />To what extent can this be worked around? If an instrument in the mix uses only two operators, perhaps it could be run in the 2x2 algorithm (algorithm 4 in TFMMaker), with quiet noise on one pair of operators with an amplitude of one LSB. Would that work as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither" class="postlink">dither noise</a> source?

It's hard to describe how that difference changes the characteristics of the sound. It's quite subtle, but once you realize it, you always hear it. <br /><br />To me, YM2612 emulation sounds more transparent, but also more... "glassy". The sound of the real chip is a bit more... "beefy".<br /><br />It seems the lack of DAC resolution adds, in a noisy way, more amplitude to the lower volume spectrum.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">To what extent can this be worked around?

<br />
<br />I think it always acts as some kind of dither source, hence the subtle impression that the sound is less glassy, but also a bit less defined, on the real chip. I think it can be compared to the triangle wave of the NES. The first Nesticle versions emulated it straight, by using all the bits of the sound channel available. This resulted in a much more dull sound compared to the "beefiness" created by the aliasing of the actual triangle wave, which is only 4 bits in resolution.
<br />
<br />We know that the YM2612 mixes sound by multiplexing the six channels through one single DAC. A naive viewpoint would assume that this DAC is 8 Bit, and that the software DAC register is simply being sent to it when the timeslot for channel 6 is reached (given that the FM portion of the channel is deactivated).
<br />
<br />But that wouldn't explain the amount of distortion going on for the FM sound, because it sounds more like 6-7 Bit. We know that the other YM chips output their sound data in a floating point format to their external DACs, so maybe this distortion is a result of a simplified on-chip conversion. Like there is some kind of non-linear mapping going on which emphasizes the lower bits of the DAC.
<br />
<br />This can only be resolved by decapping the YM2612 and tracing the MOL and MOR lines.

<br />
<br />Then there's a load of other issues caused by external analog circuitry... most MDs got heavy filtering happen and when it comes to MD2s then low quality opamp chips with their bandwidths exceeded thus producing high amount of distortions. MD1s generally suffer from hiss and muffledness but those are all caused by headphone amp chip + the lowpass filters.

I have the feeling that the internal data being fed to the YM2612 DAC is somehow altered to make it appear like listening to a 6 Bit sample. Even 8 Bit samples don't sound nearly as noisy as the real YM2612 when playing quiet sounds.

<br />Yeah, but this is again no explanation for this strange anomaly in the sound output. I can also hear it on the AV connector on the back.

<br />It's a shame I have currently no possibility to test any kind of code on my Mega Drive.
