<br />You need a good CPU reference, which will tell you which flags are affected by each instruction. For every executed instruction, the flags it affects must be updated.

<br />It does. If an instruction is said to affect a flag, it will set or clear it, never set it or leave it alone. If a flag was left alone, how would you trust it's results, since it would hold values from previous operations?
<br />
<br />The page you linked to explains most of it. <a href="http://www.obelisk.demon.co.uk/6502/registers.html" class="postlink">This page</a> explains the flags (at the bottom), and the one you posted tells which instructions affect them. The one that might not be very clear is the overflow flag, but it's known to be more confusing than the others. Search the forum, there were a few topics explaining it.

<br />For instance look at ROL

<br />	LDA #$D1
<br />	ROL $1
<br />	BRK
<br />in the simulator you end up with a Zero flag.

<br />"ROL" without an operand will rotate the accumulator. Maybe you used that $1 because you wanted to rotate just once? Anyway, this is not how it happens with the 6502, all rotations and shifts work only once, if you want to shift something twice or more you have to use the command multiple times.

<br />
<br />In the 6502 reference, it says set zero flag if A=0. 
<br />In this example, when you run it, A != 0 but the result of rotating address $1 will be zero.  The flag is set to zero even though the reference does not mention memory ROL operations that have a  zero result should set the Z flag
<br />
<br />to paraphrase 
<br />ROL
<br />according to reference Zero flag is set if A==0
<br />A!==0 
<br />but Result == 0
<br />so flag is set

<br />
<br />I have all the instructions implemented now, but again have found a poorly worded statement in the reference. 
<br />
<br />if you look at any branch statement you will see 
<br />mode        opcode   bytes      cycles
<br />Relative  	$90        2          2 (+1 if branch succeeds +2 if to a new page)
<br />
<br />So does this mean that on a successful branch that crosses a page boundary we have used 4 cycles or 5 cycles?
<br />
<br />Also, can this statement overflow causing the PC to go from FFFF to 0 or 0 to FFFF?  and if so would this be considered a page boundary cross?

<br />I believe so, but I wouldn't expect this to happen very often since page $FF is ROM and page $00 is RAM. I can't even think of any useful code that would be split between these pages and would need branching back and forth.

<br />"t" is the temporary VRAM address register. When writes to $2005/6 are performed, they affect this register, and only at specific times this register is copied to the actual VRAM address register.
<br />
<br />"x" is the fine horizontal scroll. That information is probably separated from the address register because it isn't used to fetch data.
<br />
<br />"d" is the data that was written to the register. That diagram shows what bits from the data end up where in the register.

<br />Read the byte and calculate whether it would be in range if it were a Y coordinate. But if you're aiming to trade off accuracy against releasing your first alpha version, precise overflow flag behavior (as described in step 3) really isn't necessary except for some really obscure raster effects that I don't think any licensed game used.
