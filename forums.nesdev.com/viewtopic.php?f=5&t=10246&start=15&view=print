I can't stand this trend of operating systems telling me where to store my stuff, like their organization system suited everyone in the world.</div><br />It's possible to move the My Documents folder in Windows. I moved it to another drive so that if/when I have to reinstall Windows all my files would be safe (as long as they're saved in that folder...)</div><br />You can move My Documents anywhere you want (right-click on My Documents folder, choose Move, then pick what you want Windows to use), but %APPDATA% will still be C:\Documents and Settings\yourusername.  I know this because I do the same thing you do (I move mine to D:\Important Documents).<br /><br />There are some programs which do store stuff in My Documents (often games, i.e. My Documents\My Games) -- examples include Borderlands 1 and 2, Halo, Faster than Light, and Freelancer -- but there are others which store that stuff in their own installation folder, and others which install stuff in %APPDATA%\programname.  Don't mistake this for %USERPROFILE%\Local Settings, which <strong>also</strong> has an &quot;Application Data&quot; folder in it (and there is a difference between the two -- one is sync'd with roaming profiles, the other isn't).<br /><br />With the introduction of Windows 7 (possibly Vista, don't remember), Microsoft destroyed the ability to move My Documents -- it's one of my 100+ reasons I stay with XP.  I have not the slightest fucking idea what &quot;Libraries&quot; is supposed to represent, all I know is that the way it's implemented/layed out makes no sense, and that the names of some of the things in there don't even match what they are on the filesystem.  It was one of the first things I saw that indicated someone at the company was just screwing around/changing shit for the hell of it, rather than actually changing something to solve a problem.  Likewise, what they did with their &quot;Games&quot; stuff is also confusing as hell (I still to this day cannot figure out what that nonsense is about) -- I encountered a game which used it (EVE Online) briefly, but after a few versions/releases they reverted to the old way because people were pissed off.<br /><br />The only thing they did on Vista/7/8 that I liked was move the idiotically-long base path from C:\Documents and Settings to C:\Users.  The rest of what they did is just one big long fart.<br /><br />There are ways to address all this (moving %APPDATA% and so on), but it's a global thing not a per-user thing.  And don't even get me started on roaming profiles, which I had to deal with/help manage in a manner of speaking at my past job.  They're a clusterfuck, complete and total clusterfuck -- hard proof that Windows is still to this day not a good multi-user OS.

You'll need a separate copy of Nestopia for every user like I described above (and you'd need this for the separate Windows account method described below too).<br /><br />This isn't that much work, unless you have, say, a hundred people using a single computer.  In which case, do what I said: make separate Windows accounts and then drop Nestopia and its stuff into the relevant %USERPROFILE% directories and set the paths in the .xml appropriately as well.
