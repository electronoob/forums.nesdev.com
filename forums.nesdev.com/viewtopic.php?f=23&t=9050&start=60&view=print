		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />IMBNES from what I remember does not require any Sony owned libraries or software. I remember assembling it once. From Sony's point of view they could not do anything about someone pressing discs with IMBNES on them. I'm not sure if you understood my point earlier that what I've been talking about is the official Psy-Q SDK for PS1. When you compile programs using it, the libraries you are linking to are protected under copyright and thus you could be found guilty of copyright infringement if you then sold your compiled program in some form.<br /><br />However if you used open source libraries or programmed your own you would not have to worry about this. Nothing is stopping anyone from doing that and pressing their own discs for a homebrew/unlicensed PS1 game. It would require a method to run an unlicensed disc unless the security signature was duplicated. I don't think this would be a significant problem as common PIC chips can be programmed into modchips, or one of many swap methods or parallel port devices could be used to boot the disc.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's unlikely for them to do anything. There is nothing for them to gain spending money to stop someone from using their ancient SDK to make freeware. But technically if they wanted to stop you from distributing the game they could be an annoyance. Very unlikely though. It's entirely possible you could get away with selling a game using the official SDK so long as no one noticed or Sony didn't choose to take any action. <br /><br />But moving from freeware to a commercial product is a big difference since money starts changing hands.

You know, if other companies have used emulators people have made (or at least that's what I think you're saying) does anyone know if the Virtual Console emulators are even made by Nintendo or just hijacked? That would be ironic...<br /><br />What I want to know is if Nintendo is all anti emulators and maybe homebrew or whatever, has anyone actually gone to Nintendo to try to release a homebrew game on virtual console? Then again, if there is some sort of exclusivity agreement thing, I wouldn't want to.

There was also supposed to be <em>Retro City Rampage</em>, and Brian Provinciano essentially had to go into stealth mode for years in order to get Nintendo to become willing to offer a devkit. But Nintendo is historically <a href="http://www.wired.com/2011/03/nintendo-garage-developers/" class="postlink">not a big fan</a> of amateurs going professional for the first time on its platforms.

I don't think you're doing anything immoral, but it really isn't legal, and this should not be a surprise to you.<br /><br />Making a fan game probably is good for the community. I don't see why it can't be that at the same time as being a copyright risk.<br /><br />If you don't want to feel like you're &quot;<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1348643050/nintendo-nes-retroplayernl-championship-2015" class="postlink">getting away with something</a>&quot; you could keep everything you made and replace everything that was borrowed from Mega Man, of course.
