Even if there is some computer configuration that causes your game to crash, chances are pretty good that you'll hear about it and can patch it. Keep in mind that a lot of games don't write their own engines from scratch anyway.

Players expect PC-exclusive games to look photoreal</div><br />It depends on the cost, really. Some cheap/free games may even look photorealistic due to the number of game-making tools that exist today, but they usually suffer from other constraints that place them below AAA titles. Cheap/free games are expected to be simpler than AAA games in one or more areas, be it originality, story, length, replayability... or graphics/audio, as is the case with pseudo-retro games.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">3. Inadvertent reliance on implementation-defined, unspecified, or undefined behavior causes crashes, unless you have a huge budget to buy a large cross-section of PCs on which to test</div><br />If you use well established frameworks/engines/libraries, you're not the one that has to worry about this, and even if you aren't, the requirements for pseudo-retro games are so low that you can often go for the lowest common denominator, greatly improving compatibility.

I had a bunch of consoles in my childhood (and growing up I had desires to make a platformer game for the GBA, DS, NES, Genesis, Pokémon Mini, and MegaZeux, several of which I actually had started on an engine for) and picking NES was pretty arbitrary. Now I'm doing Game Boy Color for a bit and that was an arbitrary decision too.<br /><br />What I <em>do</em> care about is if it would be interesting (consoles where you just write C/C++ and OpenGL aren't) and if there's an audience (which something new and obscure wouldn't have).<br /><br />The NES already pretty much belongs to hobbyists now anyway. Its patents are dead, we know how it works almost entirely, the CIC is cloned, we have a large library of hobbyist games being produced on real cartridges, and even our own NES-compatible consoles. And this is all already completely legal.

I was already interested in how they worked, but there was no way for me to research this back then. Once emulation became widespread, I could finally do my research, and I chose the NES basically because it was the easiest to study due to the debug tools in Nesticle. So yeah, Nesticle is probably the reason why the NES is my retro console of choice.

I have a lot of games on steam that have local multiplayer on PC. I have several friends that also have PCs hooked up to their TV like this.<br /><br />You've often insisted in the past and here that people don't do this, for some reason. Tons of people do this. I do this. Why do you think &quot;people&quot; don't? Some don't, some do. It's a good, very viable option.
