		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, In my single screen game I wanted to have multiple, independently moving platforms, is it possible to split more than two times the screen on a NROM project, using only Sprite0 and Audio Sample Channel? I wanted the platforms to work more or less like this old arcade game: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVS9YRkg-uw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVS9YRkg-uw</a><!-- m --><br /><br />If it's not possible, is there any alternatives? All moving sprites are 16x16 but I might change it to 16x24, and all I can think of is:<br /><br />1. Use black sprites and move them to simulate movement in the platform (as smooth as scrolling, but at least 3 or 4 sprites would be used per hole, and I would like to be able to place at least two holes per platform without having crazy flicker when the main character goes through them)<br /><br />2. Limit the scrolling to the platform that the player is currently (boring! and I'm not sure if I could make a fun, challenging game with stationary platforms with my current design)<br /><br />3. No platform scrolling, redesign of the game ( <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> )<br /><br />Any ideas?

MMC3 using the forthcoming INL-ROM mini. Or were you aiming to get your work onto a collaborative multicart that lacks a scanline counter?<br /><br />5. Spend most of the CPU time in a cycle waiting loop. This is doable and has been used in games like F-1 Race and Rad Racer. Possibly letterbox the display to give time at the top and bottom of the screen for game processing.

Since I want to have my game in a cart someday, and I also want to release the ROM on the internet (free of charge, of course) to contribute with something, that's the only doable option for me. Plus it would be weird to use a complex mapper for a simple game like mine. There's no point on making a game to be enjoyed by few or no people when I could distribute it basically instantly to anyone interested.<br /><br />Or maybe I could even enter a homebrew contest with it! (wishful thinking)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">5. Spend most of the CPU time in a cycle waiting loop.

But I'll try to see if I can figure it out with the wiki documentation then (if you have any relevant article or forum post, please share, it would help a lot!)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I didn't know you'd reply so fast, but I thought of two more after rewatching the video. If it's fine to interpret as a moving hole in a static floor or wall, as seen in <em>Kaos</em> and <em>Jawbreaker</em>, this can be done by adding and removing floor sections in the background. This opens two more methods:<br /><br />6. The method of Chocolate Ghost house in <em>Super Mario World</em>. Use one sprite for the left and right side of each hole. This requires two sprites per hole, one for each side, which might start to screw you when three holes are on one line.<br /><br />7. Eight different tiles for different amounts missing from the right side of a tile, and eight more for the left.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />With MMC3, there are a few games with many scroll splits, like Bucky O'Hare: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2BxMv0NalI#t=2m06s" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2BxMv0NalI#t=2m06s</a><br /><br />If you're trying to use sprite 0 hit and/or DPCM IRQ, I expect jitter might make it difficult to do more than few lines, since the jitter error will compound for each additional line. (I'm not sure whether other IRQs would have this problem. The MMC3 I think would be stable as long as you acknowledge before the next scanline is counted.)<br /><br />The other option is sprite 0 to hit the first one, and then some carefully made NOP loops to time the splits. This is more stable (the only jitter will be from sprite 0 hit, no compounds), but you can't do it for the whole screen because you need to leave some time for game logic to run. Also, DPCM should be avoided here since it introduces jitter.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I like the idea of using sprites to make tile rewrites smoother, I would have 2x sprites per hole, so at worst case I could have 2 holes x 2 Sprites + Character x 2 Sprites + Enemy x 2 Sprites = 8 sprites/scanline. I could have 3 holes, but since it would be hard to have the enemy AND the character to be at the same line traversing holes I could flicker the enemy with no problem. This is the simplest approach and I rather not do more tricky stuff, specially on my first project  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><br />Maybe I could use 6 tiles to represent the edges of the hole moving but I'll see if I have room to spare, it's a NROM game, after all.<br /><br />Thanks a lot!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I vote for the 2 options that don't require scroll splits at all. Better to keep it simple if you can. <em>Bucky O'Hare</em>, which has already been mentioned, does this crazy <a href="http://youtu.be/dWHPNnrTmKs?t=36m24s" class="postlink">simulated two-layer scroll</a> without IRQs or anything fancy (i.e. it can be done on NROM - but would look better with CHR-RAM, because you'd have more control over the background pattern), even though it uses the MMC3.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well I just did the scanline counting method for my title screen... it's actually not hard at all, of course I'm only doing it once after Sprite0 hit. Since it splits at different scanlines on PAL/NTSC I just painted a row of tiles with a solid color, so it's not possible to notice the difference.<br /><br />I'm considering not doing moving platforms on my game, but I'm not sure what will work better. Once my game is more or less playable I'll decide.
