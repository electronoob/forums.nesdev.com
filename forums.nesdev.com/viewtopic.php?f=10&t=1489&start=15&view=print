		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Disch, your code seems to explain well what's going on. The window that Sonic has is indeed pretty narrow. And although it is quite tall, the camera tries to keep Sonic centered while he's on the ground. Maybe that's the trick?
<br />
<br />Also, Sonic's position doesn't seem to have a direct influence on the position of the screen. I feel like the screen has it's own speed, wich is what Sonic affects, and is what allows him to move faster than the camera.
<br />
<br />I though about the window approach before, but never tried it, thinking it would be bad to have more stuff behind you than in front of you. But if it is done like in Sonic, where the window is so narrow, it looks and feels ok. Also, as most of the Sonic action is left-to-right, I get the feel that the window is not exactly centered, it is placed a bit towards the left, leaving a larger visible area at the right, wich is where you'll usually be heading to.
<br />
<br />baisoku, a quick scan through your code hasn't allowed me to understand it yet. I'm kinda sleepy now, I'll try to look at it again tomorrow.

<br />Yes, the screen in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em> has a maximum speed, and that is 2 rows of 8x8 pixel tiles in each dimension.

<br />Wich allows us to achieve Sonic-like speeds on the NES. Even if moving on both axes. Of course, the complexity of any current events may slow it down, like the number of enemies on the screen and such, but technically, it is possible to have a smooth Sonic game (unlike the glitchy pirates Somari and Jurassic Boy) on the NES.
<br />
<br />I plan to prove that one day, making a decent port of Sonic (still a pirate, though). Of course, a direct port would be boring, so I have to think of something new. Oh well...

<br />
<br />For some odd reason, a fan-game of an existing series feels much less lame than an obvious copy disguised to look like an original idea.
<br />
<br />EDIT: There are thousands of Sonic games made with "Click N' Play" styled tools, and even some that were actually programmed, and they are never referred to as "pirate originals". Does the fact that these games are not made for profit change anything?

<br />Only because the developer of the original game hasn't referred to the clones as such. (And yes, I'm familiar with Clickteam's tools.)

<br />Oh well... About the tool, I said "styled" 'cause I think there are others around, I'm not familiar with the people who make them.
<br />
<br />Anyway, having a game with characters named "Phonic", "Nails" and "Buckles" would not be enough to escape from a law suit, huh? I'd kinda like to use those names... =)

<br />
<br />It includes one I like the most, which keeps the player near the left or right side of the screen based on the direction he's facing, but doesn't scroll unless the player is moving. It also gives the player some "wiggle" room before scrolling, so he can be moving one direction (with scrolling), then reverse direction and move a bit without scrolling the other direction.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the binary. I used to think that the algorithm that moves the camera to show more stuff in front of you was annoying, but the one that does the same thing, but only when you're moving felt worse. It gives a certain feel of interruption...
<br />
<br />If you are moving to the same side most of the time, the Sonic-type of camera feels good. Although the window in this demo was a bit large in my opinion.
<br />
<br />It was nice to get a direct comparison of algorithms. I missed trying the vertical scrolling along with the horizontal, though.
