<br />I guess you just have to buy the actual game. Tepples should confirm that however.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The closest thing to legal would be a "Lock-On" cart, similar in shape to a Game Genie or a Sonic &amp; Knuckles cart, that watches for MMC5 bankswitch requests and patches the data as needed. I seem to remember one revision of Bases Loaded doing something like this. But if you try to sell these Lock-On carts, Square Enix still has more lawyers than you.
<br />
<br />But as long as you're not planning to sell repros, you can probably get away with buying a Just Breed cart, dumping it yourself, patching your dump, burning it to flash, and soldering the flash into the cart.

<br />No, because it doesn't sit between the game and the console, either physically or (in the case of boot discs for disc-based consoles) logically.

They aren't consistent. it's up to them what they want to allow people to put up for auction, and they decide on a case by case basis (usually when there is a complaint) which auctions to disallow.  They don't need a good reason for them to cancel your auction or do other nasty things to you as a seller.  It doesn't do any good to try to say "my product doesn't technically fit into anything you have in your dissalowed list" once they have decided to cancel your auction (or whatever).<br /><br />Being in the dissalowed list isn't a death sentence either.  A quick search for game genies will show you Ebay doesn't care if people, and ebay stores put up autions for game genies despite the fact that it says "game enhancer" right on the label and on the subject line of the auctions.  I doubt that you would be able to get these auctions pulled if you complained that they technically violate policy document X by being a game enhancer.<br /><br />They want to cover everything so they can pull any auction they want, but in the end it's entirely subjective.[/quote]

<br />"IANAL but I play one on TV." I read Slashdot's "Your Rights Online" (YRO) section, which links to articles written by lawyers and paralegals, and sometimes I read a <em>lot</em> of statutes and analysis while trying to understand the background behind a given article. So I'd guess you could call me an "armchair paralegal". And I've had to read eBay policy for my job.

<br />
<br />What if you sold a Game Genie with a likeness of the Virgin Mary on it? What a dilemma  for Ebay!
<br />
<br />Well the NES one lets you do like 5 patches, but the Game Cube one basically lets you write an entire program to memory and run it with 1000s of patches. So that could be the reason for the blanket ban.
<br />
<br />Instead of ebay you could try a local video game store (not a chain...), some of them have mountains of old junk like that lying around. Including a Gyromite cart with the adapter board inside.
