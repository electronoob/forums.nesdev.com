If this was to be a proper game I would probably change player colour on a per level basis, slightly anyway, to go with the atmosphere. Also how well he reads would also have to be tested on fullscreen NTSC with emulation or real CRT.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah but there are some ways to get around that, or make better use of the third palette.<br /><br />Using sprites or a double wide latter would cut down to two palettes.<br /><br />Even better might be to keep the third palette and use that palette more often in the 'sky-surface' transition areas.  The dark brown patterning would have to move out of those immediate areas of course.  But you could round off in the corners and vertical ridging of the ladders and such.  Doesn't work everywhere as the background isn't always white.  But areas where it was made white could add to the detail and make better use of the palette instead of only for the ladders.

Honestly if you're creating something that'd be desirable for a homebrew I'd say make use of as many of the 256 tiles in a pattern table as you'd like for a given level/scene.  The only reason to limit total tiles in a game is if you're using CHR-ROM, but CHR-RAM is the clear choice for a larger than NROM homebrew.  Even if it's just UxROM.  Only thing worth leaving room for is an HUD, maybe 30-50 tiles or less?  Since it's RAM you wouldn't even need to store the entire alphanumeric alphabet, just use a tile per character.<br /><br />Pattern tables compressed into PRG-ROM are relatively cheap.  I'd go as far as to say they can be made effectively free in many cases.<br /><br />My point is, feel free to use up the majority of a PT for a scene! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  If you're not using them, they're effectively being wasted IMO.

If texboxes using both japanese katakana and hiragana show up, close to 128 tiles could be used only for that, leaving only 128 tiles for background graphics.

You could have even more via bank switching without much trouble, my suggestion allowed the graphics to stay on UNROM.  Battlekid's tile use isn't so complex that it couldn't scroll.  It was just a design/style decision sivak made which removes the complications involved with scrolling, I can't imagine it was due to tile limitations...
