I don't enter into any contracts until I'm ready to put carts into production and even so, the only person who agrees to NOT distribute the rom is Brian, the retrousb owner.  In theory, I could give out the rom, but won't.
<br />
<br />I do give out betas to a few people and I'm planning to have a public demo rom with the first boss or something.  (I need to code the actual boss first!  I just got some graphics for it last night)
<br />
<br />But after that point, I don't think I'll be doing too many other demos.  I may gather a select group to do testing but I haven't figured out how that will work yet.
<br />
<br />The final rom will not be available by me.  That isn't to say eventually some crook will dump and distribute it, but hopefully there will be some more respect on that matter.  I don't plan to charge an insane amount of money for the final product.  Maybe $30.
<br />
<br />Anyway, that's that.

Not that we don't like you or your game, but seeing how expensive the games are plus the port, it would really need to be a <em>really</em> good and long game to be worth it. And wihtout playing it, it's hard to guess how good or long the game is. Personally I'll give all my games for free so that I'm sure all people that want to play them will be able to, I'd rather have much more people playing my game than just get money, but it's a personal choice.
<br />
<br />Just remember that when you come to ask question on NESdev, we don't ask you money in exchange of advice. I would <em>really </em>feel bad to come ask some people some advice, and use this advice to make money from the same people that give you advice.
<br />
<br />However, I 100% agree it is not a good idea to spread betas. I won't do that, as I only want one version of the ROM to fload arround the net (well, two actually, one for NTSC and the other for PAL). It would be very bad if people would download the beta thinking it is the final version, and think "his game shucks and isn't even complete", when it's actually not the case.

<br />
<br />In fact I feel the same way about some concepts of open source.  I fully support the rights of someone who spent a long time creating something to keep it as private as possible.  If someone else really wants to hack the source, as is completely possible, then let them go to that trouble.  If somebody wants to be totally open source, then that's ok, too.
<br />
<br />If I ever get to the point of releasing something, my personal philosophy will be to release a ROM so the internet at large can play it - that might get some blog posts or something and make it known.  Then if I can sell the game somehow I might put in a bonus for people who buy it, but I wouldn't want to make any money on it, the main thing would be to own my own NES game on a cartridge which is of course the coolest thing in the world.

<br />
<br />Somewhat more on topic, you can (rather, should) consider using FCEUX to do a code/data log and then rip a stripped ROM, after fully doing whatever is expected in the one-level demo. Then you wouldn't have to do any actual work involving commenting out blocks of code or whatever.
