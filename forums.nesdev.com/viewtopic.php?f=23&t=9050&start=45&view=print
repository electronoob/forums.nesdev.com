I bought a copy of the first Action 53 volume, even before the compo started handing out carts for free to entrants who win, place, or show. There are probably people who would buy a copy of 240p test suite if that ever gets ported to the PlayStation.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And if so, what price would be fair?</div><br />I guess it depends on what it costs to manufacture self-booting PlayStation discs, and whether it's been tested on both the &quot;green&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; variants of the GPU.

It has never been done before, at least that i know of, and it would be a great item to own. <br /><br />Do you guys remember when Last Hope came out for the Dreamcast? I was so going to buy it but ended up not only because i didn't like it. I downloaded the iso when it became available and test played it and i hated it. It was nothing like r-type and it wasn't even fun... but people still bought it...why? Because of what it was... the first production style homebrew game for the Dreamcast... but in the end i should have bought it because now it's worth $250+ on eBay <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /></div><br /><br />I'd probably lay out $30 or so for something for this.  I'm not much of a collector anymore, but I do find unique homebrew stuff hard to resist.  I'm sure people who collect for PS would be very interested.<br /><br />My little advice.. even if you find a way to produce these for $1.50 each (not likely), there's no shame in charging $50 or whatever else you feel it's worth for the game.  I released Garage Cart for NES back in 2005 for $35 for those who got on the reserve list, then $40 for the few left-overs at the end and I felt like I was practically price gouging at that cost because they only cost me about $3 each to make (not counting labor), and it's only games that can be downloaded for free, just with a menu.  Now it shows up on price lists as valued at $1500, and I've met people who have paid more than that for it.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />  Of course the high price is because I only made like 24 of them, and it was relatively long ago, but a lot of collectors tell me they want one not as much for the rarity but because it's considered to be the first homebrew NES release.

If you want to &quot;legally&quot; sell your game in territories such as North America or Japan you cannot be violating copyrights. Well you could but there are hefty penalties if you get caught.<br /><br />lidnariq, as I said before you can get around the copy protection with a GameShark or any other ROM memory connected to the Parallel Port if you store a program on it that can send the unlock commands to enable Read commands on unlicensed discs. Sure you could store your whole homebrew game on a cartridge device if you wanted to do so, but why do that when you can still use a CD-ROM in conjunction with any number of methods to play unlicensed discs?

Is that a bigger or smaller proportion than the number of people who still have a parallel-port PS1? (I have no idea)<br /><br />Or you could decide to have two separate parts: a parallel-port modchip and a game disc. You could even include an SD interface, since flash is so much bigger than CDROMs now.
