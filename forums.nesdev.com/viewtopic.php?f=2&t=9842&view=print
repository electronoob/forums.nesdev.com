		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For the penultimate boss in my game, I didn't know if the idea I had would be possible because i don't know how well the NES can split up regions to scroll.  I tried reading the wiki about scroll regions but I wasn't sure if I was clear on what it said.<br /><br />For the first part of the boss, I simply want it to be two huge robotic legs that are comprised of background tiles (since it would be impossible to do with sprites) and they independently move up, to the side, and then down as the robot steps around.  This would mean the screen's scrolling regions would have to be split up like an upside down T, the horizontal line for the ground and the vertical line of the T for a leg on each side.  Then when the legs are destroyed, the body of the robot comes crashing down and you have to fight it after that, which I haven't thought out yet, but that's beside the point.<br /><br />I should note my game isn't being made in an NES rom, I'm simply making a Windows game that I'm trying to keep the NES limitations on as much as possible.

The main problem with this idea is that the robot has two legs, and the NES only has 1 background plane. You'd not be able to move each leg up, to the side and down independently from the other one.<br /><br />Can you provide a mock-up image of what you have in mind? I can't really see how you came to the &quot;upside down T&quot; scrolling regions.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Two independently moving legs this large would be pretty hard to pull off. The NES doesn't have any means of splitting the screen horizontally, and although mappers could do it (the MMC5 does it to some extent), none of the existing ones can do something like this.<br /><br />IMO, the best option would be to not use the scroll at all, and just redraw the legs every time they move. With a highly optimized drawing routine you could draw one of the legs in a single VBlank. The downside, which is relevant to your game, is that the precision of the movements would be restricted to 8 pixels (or 16, if you have different palettes in the same leg). Also, since there's only time to update one of them in a single VBlank you wouldn't be able to move both at the same time, but I guess that's OK.<br /><br />If the body is a single piece, once the legs are destroyed you can use a split to animate its fall with full pixel precision, it can accelerate and even bounce once it hits the floor.

Imagine a MMC2/4 with 1KB background banks and unlimited CHR.  As long as you could fit each leg/foot in 1KB while still you could shift that and have 16 different version of the same tile assuming you had more than 32 banks to play with.  You could move the leg 2 pixels in any direction including diagonally with a single bankswitch.  You'd only have to redraw a handful of tiles whenever you crossed a tile boundary.  You could use the other two banks for other items one for still objects and the other for bankswitched animated objects.  Even a left to right scrolling floor if you wanted.

The tile variations for all the possible vertical and horizontal positions would amount to a lot of tiles: for pixel-perfect precision you'd need 64 variations of each tile.
