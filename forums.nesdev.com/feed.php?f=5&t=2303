As a Joe Gamer back before I really got into homebrew, when I read about the lockout chip and my SMB3 cartridge began failing, I decided to give it a try. 45 minutes later, my razor blade and I had got the pin cut and SMB3 was working again. So no, I don't think the average person would be too leery of disabling it.<br /><br />Anyway, if I were rich enough, I'd purchase some hardware for the mass-production of cartridges and mapper hardware and offer my services to homebrewers wishing to sell their products, for a modest fee. That way, people wishing to try selling their games wouldn't have to risk a large investment without assurance that anybody would want to buy their game. And, of course, I could use it to produce my own products as well, if I ever get around to producing any...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1013">commodorejohn</a> — Sat Oct 21, 2006 3:17 pm</p><hr />

Maybe it's time to have this thread split, no? Anyway, let's go! =)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Famiclones tend to fail Blargg's tests and have screwed up pulse waves.<br /></div><br />I don't think Joe Gamer cares about that. And although there are a few games that have trouble running on famiclones, I doubt that modern developers will make abuse of timing tricks, as it's hardly necessary in a real game. In demos, yes sure, it's fun, but in games, I just don't see the need. There are hardly any complex finished games, so I don't see any that use tricky timing in the near future. IMO, it would be a while before this becomes a serious issue.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />In the United States, where can I order an accurate famiclone that doesn't come packed with a pirate multicart?<br /></div><br />If you hate the pirate cart that much, just don't play it. Burn it if it makes you happy. You are taking this piracy thing to an extreme, man. Relax. And I'm sure there are quality famiclones that don't come with any carts (my pokefami, for example, didn't have one). Also, a while back, you said that famiclones can have unresponsive controls, but there are quite a few out there that are pretty good (the pokefami is not particularly good here, but it accepts external controllers).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />1. rare, and 2. no AV output. The common case by far is the front-loader.<br /></div><br />I know the front-loader is way more common, but I'm saying that there is an option (and it's <strong>legal</strong>, which I know scores major points with you). And I believe there are converters that will split RF into audio and video. I know it won't make quality better, but will make the NES more compatible.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />A lot of morons are afraid of breaking their NES or the law.<br /></div><br />As I said, Joe Gamer could be very happy with his famiclone. People who are serious about this should be able to cut a pin. And you can't be serious about this "breaking the law" thing. I find it really nice that you like to do things the right way, buy only legal stuff and all, I really do. If I lived in the US, where prices are way more fair and things are way more organized than here in Brazil (when things get here, they cost double the price it costs for you guys), I'm sure I'd be like that too. But it's just a small freaking tiny piece of metal, inside of something that you <strong>own</strong>. You have the right to do whatever you want with it, as long as it doesn't hurt Nintendo. I doubt any "lockout chip pin inspector" will ever knock on my door!<br /><br />I just don't think it's fair to blame it all on the lockout chip. As Bregalad said, the japanese don't have it, and the scene is still pretty slow over there too. The japanese MSX scene is incredibly more active.<br /><br />I'm not acusing anyone of anything either. I'm the first to not finish anything I start. Most of you have done much more than I have. I'm just wishing here, you know?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Oct 20, 2006 7:59 pm</p><hr />

I'd like to make everyone understand that if a game was good 15 years ago it is still good today, and that if graphics were great 20 years ago they are still great today. I consider the large majority of 3D games have worse graphics than 2D games due to the atrocious look of sharped polygons, wich never happens with pixels drawn carefully by hand (even with low resolusion). Only the very last recent 3D games can graphically compete with the SNES games with good graphics now.<br /><br />And you mean you would build your own famiclones with much more accurate hardware (Nintendulator in the form of a console ?).

I'd consider all that to be modern, though not in the same sense you mean.  No doubt though that games would need to have insanely good production quality to get much attention outside of the usual NESdev/homebrew community.  Meeting modern expectations on antique platform is a pretty interesting challenge, I know from designing (but far from fully programming) a game I was working on. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Oct 20, 2006 11:39 am</p><hr />

<em>---<br />Admin edit: For context of discussion, topic split from here:<br /><a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=2072&amp;start=34" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=2072&amp;start=34</a><br />---</em><br /><br />What would happen then if any of us would become rich ? Would this help people to complete their NES homebrew projects ? I think it doesn't make sense.<br />You'd just have no problem with buying rare cartridge with a rare board on eBay for $200 (to make sure nobody will put a higher price) and then destroy it to input your own game, wich is kinda stupid in some way.<br /><br />Oh yeah, if any would become REALLY rich he could give classes to teach how to programm to the NES and then pay them as full time employees to people that would already got some formation on how to programm games. That could help, but that would require getting ridiculously rich and then ridiculously waste that money. If someone would do that, he would definitely do it for a modern gaming system or PCs, so that more people would be actually intereseted in his games and he could do a much better buisness (anyway I don't programm games for buisness myself).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Oct 20, 2006 11:12 am</p><hr />
