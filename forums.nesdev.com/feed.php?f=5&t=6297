Since my time for hobby is almost non existent with my second child and the rules that changed at work, my first goal for the prototype was to make a quick editor that would be useful right away to do some nes programming (and remove some stress from the current the boring stuff at work).<br /><br />I will check how to get the source code of Nesicide 2 (git? Don't know the tool so I must figure that out first), try to compile it and see what it does. After that I can see if I can contribute some of the thing I want to do in my code editor.  If there is any doc on how to make it work on the windows platform, I would like to read it because from my quick overview of the site, the information seemed to be lacking (maybe I didn't check properly). <br /><br />But still, what would be the other "must have" option for the code editor? Multi-assembler support? Other things that could be useful?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Fri Apr 16, 2010 10:13 pm</p><hr />

In fact, I could really use your help!  You are correct about the first nesicide.  The second nesicide still has an in-built assembler.  It is ASM6 written in new clothes [flex/bison].<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Banshaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Nesicide doesn't support ca65, my editor will.<br /></div><br />The intent of nesicide is to contain an internal assembler to "get people going" but also to be externally hookable to a compiler/assembler/linker of user choice.  I got to the point with the original nesicide of being able to interact with a stand-alone ASM6.  The drawback there is that there was no efficient way to marry the assembler with the main tool [and get everything I wanted from the assembler for use with the debugger].  In the second nesicide with the internal assembler I can do things like step through the original source code.  It currently works well for some NROM examples I've tried.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Banshaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />- Support CA65 (and maybe other ones in future)<br />- Support syntax color highlighting<br />- Recognize my symbols that I write in my project, project wide<br />- Can show me the content on mouse over of symbol<br />- Can give me online help for 6502 instructions<br />- Offer me intellisense like Visual studio for my symbol<br />- Show me a list of my function for current document<br />- Could validate my syntax (if I can make it goes that far)<br />- Give me some tool to re-factor variables when I rename one<br /></div><br /><br />The second nesicide has a syntax colorizer that essial wrote back when he was helping me.  He's long since disappeared, hence the need for more help!  The assembler I wrote provides symbols, IR-to-file/line mappings and symbol addresses which can be used by the debugger.  As a matter of fact I am probably minutes away from implementing symbolic debugging, which would include [in my hopes anyway] the 'hover over to inspect' variety.<br /><br />Lastly the second nesicide is cross-platform...works on Linux, Windows, MacOS, etc.<br /><br />Well...check out nesicide2 and see if you think it would be worth helping get your features into the IDE.  I really could use the help and I agree that your list of planned or existing features is must have!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3705">cpow</a> — Fri Apr 16, 2010 7:44 pm</p><hr />

@Tepples/TheFox:<br /><br />I read a little bit on the subject and no, you don't need VS for distributing your package but some kind of stand alone player that is already 130 megs. A little bit of a heavy requirement. Then by reading TheFox link, you need all kind of thing to create your package like some valid key etc. That seems quite a painful process. But I agree, it would be interesting to have an extension to VS. <br /><br />@Rid:<br /><br />As for Eclipse.. I like the fact that it's multi-platform but I never felt at home with it. I prefer Visual studio. Maybe it's because I have been using it for a while I prefer the debugging feature that it offer.<br /><br />My current prototyping is done with Scintilla with the .net wrapper and I'm using dockpanel suite for the tabbing function.  For now my main goal was to be able to program a few things during my lunch time that could pass under the radar and I can use more or less 30-40 minutes when I'm lucky.  I started to work on that idea to help me refresh on regex and to see if I could do my own lexer with scintilla or not.  It went more far than expected (more than coloring).  It's not operational yet. I use my current project as a test bed to see what I can do or not with the scintilla control.<br /><br />For now I don't like the auto-complete with scintilla since I cannot receive an event when the auto complete stop on a specific item. I want to show information about the symbol when it's available. I may have to make my own.<br /><br />But still, the main goal of the thread was not "it would be great to extend an ide" but more "if I had that option in my code editor, that would be great or save me time". I will give some example.<br /><br />1- I don't code 6502 code often or rarely these days. Because of that, when I go back to coding, I tend to forget addressing mode, which bit are affected or how a specific instruction can be used. By having some simple mouse over help for basic options and online help, that save me time to hunt in a different document.<br /><br />Mouse over and online help example<br /><a href="http://s389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/?action=view&amp;current=mouseOverHelp.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/th_mouseOverHelp.png" alt="Image" /></a>  <a href="http://s389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/?action=view&amp;current=OnlineHelpExample.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/th_OnlineHelpExample.png" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />2- I want to use symbol over pure address/value but I tend to forget their value. To mouse over a specific item and tell me the comment I wrote about it without opening the include file is useful.<br /><br />Example:<br /><a href="http://s389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/?action=view&amp;current=SymbolInformation.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/th_SymbolInformation.png" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />3- I don't remember all the symbol I wrote and it what scope. To have auto-complete for them is a time saver.<br /><br />Example of auto-complete (but Scintilla one doesn't work well yet...):<br /><a href="http://s389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/?action=view&amp;current=Autocomplete.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/th_Autocomplete.png" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />4- I use scope and struct often in ca65. If I had auto-complete for that, that would be great.<br /><br />5- I would like to go automatically where a symbol is defined at a press of a button<br /><br />6- (wishful thinking)  If my code editor could check my syntax and found error that cannot be found by the compiler, that would be great.<br /><br />Thinks like this. Those are not specific to integration in an IDE but just what I would find useful. Like mentioned, I'm just prototyping. This editor is not operational yet, just testing what I can do and how to do.  I hope I can prototype an example of scope between file (i.e. I can see the symbols of the local file and included one without issue).<br /><br />If it does become an editor someday, I want to support more than ca65 so it could be useful to other people too. I think once most of what I want to do in ca65 is done, doing it for other assembler that don't have scope should be a breeze.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Fri Apr 16, 2010 5:43 pm</p><hr />

Just going to throw it out there for fun: This could also be done as an extension to Visual Studio. You can add support for new languages and even debugging. But the extension framework seems quite complex, so I doubt anybody is going to take the time to do anything with it. But it would be cooooool, IMO. It should be able to do most if not all of the stuff you listed if properly implemented.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=80">thefox</a> — Fri Apr 16, 2010 7:30 am</p><hr />

I don't want to dish nesicide but my goal is different than his.  In the case of Nesicide he has his own assembler and is kind of a complete proprietary solution (that how it was for first one, I didn't check second one yet). In my case, I want to support the syntax of the assembler(s) that I like.  Nesicide doesn't support ca65, my editor will. Basically what I'm making while toying with Scintilla is a specialized text editor that:<br /><br />- Support CA65 (and maybe other ones in future)<br />- Support syntax color highlighting<br />- Recognize my symbols that I write in my project, project wide<br />- Can show me the content on mouse over of symbol<br />- Can give me online help for 6502 instructions<br />- Offer me intellisense like Visual studio for my symbol<br />- Show me a list of my function for current document<br />- Could validate my syntax (if I can make it goes that far)<br />- Give me some tool to re-factor variables when I rename one<br /><br />So, back on the subject, what option that could be interesting for a nes "text" editor (I will remove the IDE in this case) for your favorite assembler then?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Fri Apr 16, 2010 5:53 am</p><hr />

Excuse me for the question but doesn't nesicide is an efficient NES IDE?<br /><br />Why bothering to create a new one ?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3907">Rid</a> — Fri Apr 16, 2010 3:51 am</p><hr />
