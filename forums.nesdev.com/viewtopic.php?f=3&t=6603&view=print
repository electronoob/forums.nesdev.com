<br />
<br />What about the clock jitter test, or the length timing test or the length table test?  Those all pass?
<br />
<br />Also where is your APU cycle executed in relation to your CPU cycle?  [Do you run the CPU cycle then the APU cycle or the other way around?]
<br />
<br />I implemented trace tags in my execution tracer that helped me figure out where things were occurring and then I could also match the code that was executing with the source provided and see if the APU event was occurring where the test wanted it to be or not.

<br />- Yes, the previous tests pass ok. It doesn't matter if the APU is clocked before or after the PPU clock (=3 cycles). Anyway, I asked about 4017h register because setting 7456 cycles makes "too early" error; 7457 makes "too late" error. The default <em>should be</em> 7459, but Nintendulator uses a different value &amp; increment on odd cycles, for example.

<br />
<br />5-len_timing shouldn't be depending on jitter. Odd that you fail for either delay, since the test basically reads the length counter at 14915, then 14916, and ensures it's clocked between those.
<br />
<br />What channel does it fail on when you use 7456 and 7457?
<br />
<br />Hmmm, maybe you're assuming each step is exactly 7456 or 7457 apart. Not sure why this isn't in the Wiki. Here are the timings:

Anyway, the test reads $4015 two times. The first time, the APU is clocked in the 2nd cycle of the following AND instruction. The second time, the APU is clocked right after reading $4015. Both return 1 because the remaining length is still 1.

<br />
<br />Nintendulator doesn't pass test all of the tests, though.
<br />
<br />I have to say, adding an "APU Sequence Tick" tag to my execution tracer absolutely helped me figure out things like this.  I even went so far as to add a breakpoint event for Length Counter clocking, just so I could have my emulator's debugger stop right at the right moment.

<br />
<br />That might be the case for 1-len_ctr.nes, but 5-len_timing.nes looks for the count to occur on specific APU/CPU cycles.  In 1-len_ctr.nes he's expecting the length counter to expire (and he counts cycles until it does).  In 5-len_timing.nes he's looking for specific length counter clocks, each of which are separated by a specific number of APU/CPU cycles.  Did you look at the source code for the test?

<br />
<br />I'm still wondering what channel it prints for the two failures (when you use 7456 and 7457). You said for one it says too soon, the other too late. What channel does it list for each of these failures? That might shed some light on this.

<br />On cycle 37289, for mode 0, I reset the APU cycle counter to 7459 so that the next sequence tick will happen 7456 APU cycles later, as expected.
<br />
<br />Line 55661: Confused how you get to APU cycle 7460?
<br />
<br />In my thinking on this topic it helps and is easier to think of it in terms of an APU "frame" even though we're shy to use the word "frame" when talking about the APU because it implies alignment with something else, such as the PPU "frame" being aligned with the video signal.  If you think of it as in mode 0 an APU frame is 37289 APU [or CPU] cycles long, and you write your APU to trigger the expected sequence of events at the "frame-relative" cycle numbers, instead of worrying about whether you need to count 7456, 7458, or 7459 cycles between, it makes things much easier.  This is why, when I get to cycle 37289 in mode 0 I reset the APU cycle counter to 7459 and not 0...because then my mode 0 implementation doesn't need to concern itself with whether or not the sequence was reset and what that means for how many "inter-sequence" ticks I need to count before doing the next sequence tick.
