This also happens with the joystick. Suffice it to say, you can not play the vast majority of games inside a Windows virtual machine using emulated input, because you don't have any precision to work with. The solution I came up with if I wanted to play a game inside a virtual machine was to actually map the USB port to the real USB port for a mouse or joystick and that solves it. Without doing it this way, when you move an analog stick, it will only be 0% or 100% moved, because it's only tracking the relative movement and when it stops moving, it's back to zero. I hope this makes some kind of sense.</div><br />Yup. After looking a bit more at the RawInput and DirectInput drivers to clean up the behavior of mine I think that makes sense. Both those API seem to work by acquiring exclusive access to the device and read out raw relative mouse movements. And as you said, that won't work with most vm hosts with the default configuration at least.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Kismet wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">This was the trick I used to run a MMORPG game on a Mac inside Parallels, as well as the MMORPG game inside a Windows VM on top of Windows when I needed to move inventory items between two characters without going through the auction house.</div><br /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />

I presume this is just a bug in the disassembler...

In the case of SuperFX cartridges, if the CPU reads from ROM while the SuperFX is busy with it, it gets the IRQ vectors no matter what address it reads from.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been trying to debug some Super FX code, and it looks like when <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">loop</tt> is executed, the debugger displays an instruction corresponding to the byte immediately prior to the jump target in R13 rather than the byte immediately following <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">loop</tt>.  Actual code execution seems to be correct.<br /><br />Also, the display of conditional branch addresses seems to be one less than what shows up in no$sns; ie: <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">bne $8418</tt> instead of <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">bne $8419</tt>.  And sure enough, $8418 is the address of the byte immediately preceding the actual branch target, and instead of showing the byte following the branch instruction, the debugger shows the byte at $8418.  Again, actual execution seems to be correct.
