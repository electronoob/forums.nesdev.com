But there's the fact that you have zero debugging capabilities on a real NES. I mean, other than those you've programmed into the game yourself, but it's still much easier to look at FCEUXD's hex editor than writing a subroutine to display numbers somewhere on the screen. And there are kinds of debugging that I don't think are even possible with just the real console (CPU tracing, watching name tables, things like that).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Jul 01, 2009 6:30 pm</p><hr />

Then I can just hit F9, reset the NES after a second or 2, and not even have to leave the code editor.  Saves time.  I also found it motivating to see/hear it running on the system, and of course the screen looks very different from emulators.  NEStopia's tv mode seems closer to it.  It also allowed me to eventually use my own boards that aren't emulated.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Jul 01, 2009 4:44 pm</p><hr />

I don't have one, but it seems like the bad thing would be for development, having to move the flash card back and forth repeatedly for any kind of test.  I've done that enough with chips+sockets, it gets old.  Also I'm really surprised to hear that MMC3's scanline counting doesn't work.<br /><br />The good thing would be putting a lot of stuff on the cart and just leaving it in the NES.  And having an FPGA to play around with, if you're into that sort of thing.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Jul 01, 2009 2:10 pm</p><hr />

I've been fixing roms for my powerpak with Nestopia. I think in the first menu there's an "edit ines header." All I did was File...edit iNES header... then open your .nes rom, then don't do anything in the dialog box. Just hit Save As...once you have hit "ok" to save, a box will pop up saying do you want to fix the header (or something like that, forget the message). Just hit yes. For all my roms that had said: 'Bad File Header" in Powerpak, they now work fine!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Wed Jul 01, 2009 6:36 am</p><hr />
