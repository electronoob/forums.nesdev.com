		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello
<br />I just want to ask if anybody knows something about a Spelunker Famicom cartridge without the LED diode. All I can find is classic LED type cartridge like this:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=2258">http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=2258</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />But recently I obtained this PCB with SPelunker game from a friend that says that this is from a normally looking Famicom cartridge case (he no longer has it) but WITHOUT the LED. Check the PCB photos here:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://picasaweb.google.com/jpx072/Spelunker?authkey=Gv1sRgCJaCkKyXjaPNPQ#">https://picasaweb.google.com/jpx072/Spe ... KyXjaPNPQ#</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />By my opinion it is not looking piratey, or cannot be from a NES adapter-built-in type cartridge because it has no CIC chip. But I can be wrong. Also the ROMs are machine-soldered, not resoldered-looking. Does anyone know if there was a manufacturing run of this game without the LED diode? Thanks!

<br />Also Eproms on this PCB were covered with some nasty stuff like glue and some silver stuff, black marker and something unidentificable. So there is some residue glue on the pins visible, but I will clean it later. And when I succeed, it will look like new.
<br />So I really don't know, but I like the developement cart idea. Thanks for the hints.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah there are plenty of legit carts that use UV EPROM's. 
<br />
<br />I have also come across at least 1 Irem cart that comes both with and without the LED, Zippy Race. The LED ones are dated from 1985 and the non-LED one is from 1989.
<br />
<br />It seems they stopped using LED's around Sept. 1987
<br />
<br />The cart you show has EPROM's from mid-1985 and the game was released Dec. 1985, so the dev board theory fits ok there. Though I have not seen that board before and it's very odd that it would have been found in a non-LED shell.
<br />
<br />I think I have actually seen a copy of Spelunker without an LED for sale, being called rare and it was expensive.

Or at least, in disassembling old unix boxes from the mid-80s, electrical tape was often used to block the windows.
<br />
<br />So I finished reverse engineering the circuit on the board — this is definitely made for programming in-place. The jumpers labeled 1 and 2 are for switching between a 16kB (1, where pin 20 /CE is connected to pin 27 /PGM) and 32kB (where pa14 from the cart edge is connected to pin 27 A14)  PRGROM.
<br />
<br />Cart edge pins are reused to mean: 1 (ground) is program enable, 15 (/IRQ) is Vpp (+13V) for PGMROM, and 47 (CHR/WR) is Vpp (+13V) for CHRROM.  Pin 32 (φ2)  is used to strobe data into PRG ROM and pin 14 (R/W) is used to strobe data into CHR ROM.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wow thanks for the quick reverse engineering, so it's definatelly a reprogramable board of some kind. May I also assume this is a legit Nintendo board? If so, I also assume that those are pretty rare. Or maybe it is a non-LED version, I also posses the LED one, there is no defference in gameplay or graphics or anything.
<br />There was something like a deteriorated duck tape, or paper adhesive tape involved, but also some blue paint and strong glue, because it was really tough to scrap off. To get the glue from between the pins was a pain... 
<br />I have made some more photos (link in the first post), but I covered the windows with eprom stickers.
<br />Thanks to everybody involved!

If you meant one that will take an EPROM without a rewire job, then NROM boards and CNROM boards use JEDEC pinout compatible with EPROMs. So do Konami's Famicom boards and other Famicom boards not made by Nintendo.
