I'm assuming that pirate cart is the one GoodNES 3.14 calls "52 Games [p1]." You just need to change byte 0x25BE in the "Galaxian (J) [!]" ROM to 0x0A and byte 0x2645 to 0x08.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3771">Dacicus</a> — Sat Oct 24, 2009 1:36 am</p><hr />

Hi Folks,<br /><br />I'm going to start off by stating this simply:<br /><br />I haven't touched 6502 Assy in ages, and I'm feeling a bit queasy just thinking about it, but I don't think that my questions will require me to delve into the guts and bolts of this game's code...so...<br /><br />Essentially, I own, and have a ROM dump of, the 51-in-1 games multicart. (Mine is very light grey standard-NES-style cart, bearing a white label with blue text print "52 Games" and the list of the games on it.)<br /><br />It's the standard 51-Games cart, with Tengen Tetris, SMB with SMB2j graphics, Goonies, and...1989Galaxian!<br /><br />All of the rest of the games on the cart I've seen before, either as ROMs, pirate carts, or hacks, but "1989 Galaxian", to my knowledge, is unique to the 52-Games cart. <br /><br />So, why does that matter, and what's special about it?<br /><br />The only gameplay difference between Galaxian and 1989 Galaxian is that the latter has r<em>apid-fire/multishot</em> built into it, and it makes Galaxian play better (more like Galaga, but with even faster shooting). <br /><br />This turns what would be an otherwise slow and somewhat boring game into a very exciting shooter. The only other notable differences are the logo (orange instead of green and the lack of copyright text, which is typical of knockoff carts. <br /><br />...<br /><br /><strong>So, here's what I'd like to do:</strong><br /><br />I want to rip the code that makes 1989 Galaxian out of the 51-Games ROM file and patch the original Galaxian ROM with that code, to make a complete <em>(standalone)</em> ROM of <strong>1989 Galaxian!</strong><br /><br />I want this for two reasons: <br /><br />Reason One: I want to knock out a few 1989 Galaxian carts to give away as presents to friends and;<br /><br />Two, I want to add it to my "GamePak CF" without the trouble of the extra menu system and huge loading time of adding the entire 52-Games ROM to the CF system.<br /><br />So, basically, I am wondering if anyone here has experience in dealing with multicart ROMs, and knows how to locate the appropriate game data or;<br /><br />If anyone on here has already ripped 1989 Galaxian for similar reasons, or has it as a standalone so that I don't have to re-do someone else's labour or;<br /><br />If anybody here would be willing to help me achieve my goal in exchange for a custom-made cart with the game on it (that I'd be happy to make and send to you in exchange for helping me get the patch working for my own use). <br /><br />I know that many multicarts use shared code for multiple games, and they store game code in a nonlinear manner in order to save space, so I'm at a loss as to how to locate and isolate the specific code for one game from the cart...<br /><br />I'm also interested in making my own multicart ROMs, and would love to make a tri-game multicart of Galaxian, Galaxian'89 and Galaga... Now, wouldn’t that be sweet!?<br /><br />Thus, if you can offer any advice, suggestions, or assistance, or if you're willing to undertake ripping the 1989Galaxian code from the 52-games ROM, please let me know. <br /><br />My thanks in advance!<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Xious<br /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Tue Oct 13, 2009 7:17 am</p><hr />
