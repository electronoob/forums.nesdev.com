I prefer MML (music macro language) for composing chip music. For those who don't know, MML is basically a system of notating music in a text file and then running that text file through a compiler to make the appropriate music file.<br /><br />I've taken interest in AmigaMML as of late, having heard of it on this site. I'll probably be posting about that most on this thread, but I also encourage discussion of other tools for MML enthusiasts!

He started out with Zell which is in English, then moved to two Japanese ones called Mid2mml and PMML. I think all of those are almost complex enough to be a programming language. He has told me about macros he's made for all three of them, to easily achieve certain effects like arpegio, controller LFO, and other effects he likes to use in his work. I'm not so much a fan of MML for midi, though the MML route is certainly different and offers different possibilities.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">zzo38 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">There is also CsoundMML, which produces a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csound" class="postlink">Csound</a> numeric score.</div><br />I've heard of that, but haven't felt brave enough to tackle CSound. Maybe I'll get lucky and next time I look at it I'll magically make some strides.

It looks like if I do this I'll have 20 channels (A-T). Is this correct?<br />Second, if I am using samples, must I use compatible .mod instruments exported from amigasam? So no extended .xm format stuff from open mpt, such as 16 bit samples or bidi loops or the like? I'm not complaining, just trying to figure out what I can do as a total newbie.<br />And last, are there any example mml files I could mess with to get a feel for how things are set up? Doesn't sound like this tool is well-known or used much, but I was hoping there was at least one existing thing written for it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Thanks.

However, you must compile it yourself (whether you are on Windows or Linux). The program is public domain and you are free to modify it, suggest improvements, etc.<br /><br />That thing about &quot;amigasam&quot; is only true for .MOD output (and amigasam is now deprecated); if using .XM, then you can use any .XI files. There is a included program &quot;xisynth&quot; for synthesizing them, although you can also download .XI files from other sources or export them using FastTracker or OpenMPT.<br /><br />About having 20 channels, that is correct.<br /><br />(It is also possible there are some errors in the documentation; if so, you can mention them and I will fix them. It is also possible there are bugs in the program itself; if so, mention those too.)<br /><br />(Note: There used to be a Redmine server for AmigaMML, although it is no longer available; that is beyond my control though, since I did not use my own server for that. The download link above is my own server.)

When I try to use it, I either get no change, or an error.<br /><br />Also in .xm modules in Open MPT it is possible to change the speed with the Fxx effects.

However, you may also need <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">#SPEED</tt>, as well as either <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">#TEMPO</tt> or <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">#METRO</tt>; if you don't, the amount of time one row takes up is unchanged, since <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">#DIVISIONS</tt> only changes the note value of one row.) If you want to dynamically adjust the speed, one way to do so is to use the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">R</tt> command on the Z channel. (Note: since you can enter notes on multiple channels at once, it is possible to combine the A channel with the Z channel if you wish.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh okay, that makes sense now. I wasn't quite sure how that worked, I thought you put the effect codes before or after the notes you wanted the effect to start on or something. But they're treated like patterns/envelopes. Interesting. I can see how that would be useful. Is there a limit on how many of those you can have in your MML? To my understanding in trackers you just put effects down on the rows that need them, they're not really envelopes in that sense.

If so, you and I could go on the FamiTracker users' Discord server to request functionality in FamiTracker to improve its UI accessibility.

I'd be willing to try again, I just have to recover my tag lol.
