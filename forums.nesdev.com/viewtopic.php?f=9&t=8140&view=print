<br /> 
<br />Just wondering if anyone can give me a bit of a hand - I've built a little NTRQ cart using the latest rom image (that uses PRG + CHR ram) on a Mario Open Golf Famicom (HVC-SNROM) cart...
<br />
<br />Cart is built on a SNROM (PRG + CHR-RAM MMC1 famicom cartridge) on bootup it looks like all is well and you get the NTRQ bootup screen [pic 1] and the sound when first run, with correct graphics, after you go into the editor tho [pic 2] - you have a screen filled with random data (clearing current song does not work either- and on moving to the pattern editor changing a note will hang the cart) tried a couple of burns of the rom in case that was what was causing it but its the same, its running on a real Nintendo Famicom btw
<br />

<br />
<br />Also I've tried bunging on several japanese rpg's that fit the rom board and they run totally fine so pretty sure its not the dev cart - just thought I'd give you guys a heads up incase its a bug (or I'm doing something special - like perhaps building it on a slightly wrong config or something... hehe) ?
<br />
<br />I did give Neil a shout already and he recommended I should come and ask you peeps :-)
<br />
<br />Not too sure if anyone has got it running on the Famicom itself yet - I think people are running it mostly on USA Nintendo's atm - so would be ace if you could help and I can report any info back to everyone who is trying to get it running on their Fami's 
<br />
<br />Thanks!
<br />Ne7

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From the look of the corruption, something is not right with the battery RAM. The NTRQ logo only appears if the program detects that it needs to 'format' the battery RAM (crude signature check) which would give you a totally blank setup once you're into the editor. The fact that there's garbage data in there would suggest it's not getting cleared.
<br />
<br />If you turn off the console and turn it back on again, does the logo re-appear?
<br />
<br />If so, the battery RAM hasn't been properly 'formatted'. I'd start looking at that first.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hola Neil, 
<br /> Yes proper odd this - It does give the logo each time it boots up, funny thing is that it saves/restores correctly via all the RPG's I tested it with after I had probs with getting it running - could it be that existing save data is making it misbehave? Unless I've missed a wire or something but that would be very strange as all the other stuff like Sweet Home etc works flawlessly on it when testing ... Weird eh? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's an interesting theory but one thing that doesn't sit right: NTRQ only ever displays it's boot-up logo sequence if it has to 'format' the battery RAM. So, in essence, it should only ever display once (unless you boot it with the secret button combo). Each subsequent boot should go straight into the editor.
<br />
<br />Andrew says that the logo shows every time so there has to be a problem writing to the battery RAM as on reboot, NTRQ thinks it needs to show the logo again which will only occur under the conditions I described.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />aha :D SOLVED \o/
<br />
<br />Jeroen is right (thanks man :D), what I did (sorry about the delay - been bloody swamped with work here) was check that I could save over the save ram with a game (in this case Sweet Home) once that had filled up the sram nicely - did a quick reset and told the game to erase all data, this totally wiped all 8k and when I re-tried NTRQ its working just fine, logo only showed once, and saving happily any changes I quickly made to the first pattern...
<br />
<br />neil; might be worth putting a little option in to reset all sram to 0 if all buttons are held down on Controller 2 on reboot (with a yes/no dialogue) that way this could just be fixed via the software itself if there is ever any weird sram corruption or people bung it on a realcart with existing troublesome save data? The in-editor erase all data option didnt work once I was in the editor as I think the existing save data really threw everything...
<br />
<br />thanks so much for the help guys \o/ u rock.
<br />
<br />PS -  I've encountered no problems with the WRAM btw... :)

<br />
<br />There is a button-combo to perform a reset of the battery RAM. It's tucked away on page 79:
<br />
<br /><em>If you hold SELECT+UP on controller 1 when powering-on the NES (or resetting it), your “.sav” file will be erased and “reformatted”. Youʼll also see the start-up logo again.</em>
