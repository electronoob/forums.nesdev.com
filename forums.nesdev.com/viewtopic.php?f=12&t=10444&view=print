		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So amidst hammering on with SNES Tracker / MIDI. I look at my breadboard prototype SNES flasher and realize how incomplete its status is. I must first complete and design a PCB get it built before moving forward. <br /><br />There are currently 2 extra Address lines that won't fit into my MCU. That is, A22, A23. I am at the point where I just manually connect the wire when I want to interface SRAM  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><br />So, I'm looking for the best solution to break out these 2 extra lines. I have some shift registers. I might just use one, wasting 6 of the 8 slots  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" />  So if there's a better way to be minimalistic, I'd love to hear it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The other option is to put a 8x Flipflop on the data bus and use one pin to control writes to it.  The output could then drive A16-23.  It's not only FASTER than writing to a shift register, it also only requires one pin from your mcu since you've already got 8 pins dedicated to the data bus.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, flip-flops would be faster.  I just suggested the shift register because he said he had them on hand.  Personally, I prefer doubling up address lines with address lines, so A8-A15/A16-A23 driven by 2 octal flip-flops, but using the same 8 I/O pins on the MCU, rather than combining the address and data pins, since the address lines are unidirectional and the data lines are bidirectional.  I find it simpler, both conceptually and practically, to only double up the unidirectional pins if I have the choice.

I imagine that this kind of patent directly affects manufacturers of this kind of component or something?

And if you buy a patented component off the shelf, it comes with &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaustion_doctrine" class="postlink">exhaustion</a>&quot;. This allows the manufacturer to include a lawfully made patented component in a larger product.

I am setting my sights on 8x OCTAL TRANSPARENT D-TYPE LATCHES.<br /><br />The idea is that I can connect this latch chip to the databus as infiniteneslives said, and use 1 i/o from MCU to control the latch to the flipflop outputs.<br /><br />That's correct, right.<br /><br />Ok, sweet, moving forward, this is an excellent opportunity to use the recent knowledge made known to me about determining chip speeds. So that I can figure out the best speed of flip flop to order for my circuit.<br /><br />That's another story. I'll have to figure that out

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The basic idea of a flip flop is you put data onto the input lines, then toggle the clock line and the flip flop stores the value on the input line and puts it onto the output line, then you're free to change the input and it will still retain the same value on the output.  So because of this, you can connect a microcontroller pin to multiple flip flops (so long as they have separate clocks, so usually that means separate chips), and that same pin can drive as many outputs as you have flip-flops.  So in this case, with an octal flip flop IC, you'd use 8 microcontroller pins to drive 16 address lines (well, 10 microcontroller pins because of the clock on each flip flop IC).<br /><br />For the sake of simpler code, use a single port on the microcontroller (I'll use PORTA as a completely arbitrary example).  Both flip-flops will connect their inputs to that port (only the flip-flop inputs, each clock goes on a separate I/O pin).  So, using the standard nomenclature of D = input, Q = output, PORTA0-&gt;D0, PORTA1-&gt;D1 . . . PORTA7-&gt;D7.Now, if you want to connect it the way I suggested (A8-15/A16-23), the outputs for the first FF IC would be Q0-&gt;A8, Q1-&gt;A8 . . . Q7-&gt;A15, and the outputs for the second FF IC would be Q0-&gt;A16 . . . Q7-&gt;A23.  Now, to go about using them, we'll start with my pseudocode example <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=117421#p117421" class="postlink">here</a> and modify it to utilize the flip-flops on the upper address lines.  Some flip-flops are positive-edge triggered, some are negative-edge triggered.  This refers to whether the data is latched when the clock goes low-to-high (positive edge) or high-to-low (negative edge).  Check your data sheet and if necessary, swap the high/low commands on the clock lines.  I'll assume positive edge:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">char ReadByte(int address)<br />-Pull all control lines (OE, WE, CE) high<br />-Set up A0..A7<br />-Pull FF1 Clock low<br />-Set up A8..15<br />-Pull FF1 Clock high<br />-Pull FF2 Clock low<br />-Set up A16..23<br />-Pull FF2 Clock high<br />-Pull CE and OE low<br /><br />--&#91;DELAY&#93;--<br /><br />-Read data lines<br />-Pull CE and OE high<br />-Return data</div><br /><br />Notice that even though A8-15 and A16-23 are using the same I/O pins on the microcontroller, the flip-flops are storing the values for you, so once you store A8-15 in FF1, you can change the microcontroller I/O pins to the value of A16-23 and latch that.  In fact, you could do it with a single flip flop, toggle the clock line, then switch to the other value and not use a second flip flop at all.  So PORTA0-&gt;D0, Q0-&gt;A8 and also PORTA0-&gt;15, etc.<br /><br />I hope this makes sense, I'm pretty wiped out from a long weekend and if anything I said here doesn't make sense, I blame lack of sleep <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

So what I will do  without thinking is:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">set address line A0-15<br />set data bus<br />latch flip flop for A16-A23 <br />use data bus for read/write ROM data at this point<br /></div><br /><br />also, i will not have to latch very often since i will be using the latch only for the bank byte.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What you describe, a latch with D=data bus and Q=bank bits of address bus, should work fine. In fact, it's exactly how BNROM or AOROM or GNROM or the Color Dreams mapper works to select a 32K bank on an NES Game Pak PCB. For four bits, use a 74HC161; for eight, use a 74HC377. Just make sure that the flash is disabled (e.g. /CE high) while you write to the latch. Otherwise, you could end up with a bus conflict.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />TTL is less precise than CMOS, so the valid voltage ranges are larger.  Because of this, feeding a CMOS output into a TTL input will always work, but there are certain voltages at the edge of valid TTL output that would not be considered valid CMOS input.  A good design principle in a lot of fields is to be permissive with your inputs and strict with your outputs.  This can apply to data parsing, adding support for less strict protocols on your inputs, but adhering to strict &quot;correctness&quot; of anything you output.  Or, in this case, being permissive with the wider valid input ranges needed for TTL, while outputting more strict CMOS-compatible signals, which is what the HCT series does.  The fact that Nintendo used the TTL version of the 74'139 for their address decoder means that it's probably a good idea to accept TTL inputs, so since it's just as easy to pick up the HCT chip, you might as well.  However, I'm pretty sure CMOS devices work just fine.
