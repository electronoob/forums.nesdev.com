I just had this dream minutes ago:<br /><br />I was at this <strong>Mardi Gras</strong>-like place, filming with a crew.  I noticed a particular <em>girl</em> who gave me an inviting look.  I tried to hook up with her every chance I had, but things would keep happening; we'd keep getting interrupted.<br /><br />Finally, the film crew called it a night, &amp; I went to take the camera to get looked at (I think something happened to it <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> ) &amp; I saw the <em>girl</em> again smiling at me as she walked off.<br /><br />Then I see this stoutly man waering make up. I remembered passing him by earlier.  He approaches me and says: "Do you know who I am?" I noticed he was wearing the same style make up as the <em>woman</em> I tried getting with earlier.<br /><br />"Something to do with that girl." I said. He says "Yes" coldly &amp; walks away &amp; sits next to that <em>woman</em> who's not far off.<br /><br />I approached him &amp; said. "I didn't know. I'm sorry.  Had I known, I would have done differently." I should've given his <em>girlfriend</em> a stern look. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /> <br /><br />Anyway, what's grim is that the whole time I had a feeling in the back of my mind that this was all a dream.<br /><br />So should your actions reflect your principles even if it's a dream? (Please don't answer that! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" />)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=984">Jedi QuestMaster</a> â€” Wed Jun 08, 2011 2:29 pm</p><hr />
