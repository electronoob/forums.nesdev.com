I'm actually impressed that Nintendo only cease and desisted in that case. Selling pirated DS games is a whole different thing than making a fan game.

Also Nintendo is the kind of company that usually warns......and doesnt sue until you dont stop. Example here locally some guys were selling pirated ds games. First they got a cease and deceise (or however its called) letter and then they continued. Not until they continued did they get sued.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3369">Jeroen</a> — Tue Mar 24, 2009 2:54 pm</p><hr />

I agree with 6502freak above. Just because something bad CAN happen, is no indication that it will. I was TERRIFIED to release my clone for the longest time, until I realized the people I infringed upon would probably not even notice my game existed. Know what you're doing is illegal, certainly know the worst case scenario (getting sued), but if none of that scares you enough to deter you from making a clone/fan game (it should at least make you think twice about it), go on ahead.<br /><br />If you decide to go on ahead, you should still look into how "cool" the company is gonna be with your game existing. If there are any incidents you can find of other fan game creators getting a cease and desist or finding themselves in legal trouble making a game that infringes on the rights of the same game or series you're planning on making, then make sure you weigh that into your decision. If other similar fan games exist, and nothing has happened to them you should feel a little safer. This doesn't mean you can't be the first, only that I believe it's less likely. <br /><br /><br />Short version: The absolute worst that can happen is getting sued. It is up to the creator of the fan game to decide how likely this case is, and if they should go on ahead with the distribution of the game. It is my <em>opinion</em> that most likely nothing will happen depending on which company's rights you're infringing upon, but it is a <em>fact</em> that the rights holders ALWAYS have the option of taking the fan game creator to court. It is the fan game creator who's on the line, and so they must make the judgment as to whether or not they can accept that possibility. <br /><br />Edit: And in case the company in question sees this post, and take it the wrong way, I have to say that I am now and have always been perfectly willing to stop distribution of my game.<br /><br />Edit2: Rewording. Blargg makes a good point. These edits are the best compromise I can make, since I do not want the post to read as if nothing can EVER happen, but neither do I want it to read as though I personally believe it's likely. I hope I've achieved this in my post. If I haven't, let me know.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Tue Mar 24, 2009 2:41 pm</p><hr />

You guys need to stop mixing up 2 different issues: what <strong>could</strong> happen and what <strong>probably</strong> is going to happen. <br /><br />Fact is, contrary to what the other poster said, they successfully sued other companies for copying their game mechanics. But not only Nintendo, the same issue came up when Activision, license holder of R-Type, sued Rainbow Arts over Katakis, also a game with similar mechanics. So in theory, it's not as simple as many people would like it to be.<br /><br />The high probability that Nintendo won't sue any homebrew developer or seller is in no way a guarantee that what you do is legal. Just look at the NWC 1990 copies being made, which is a most blatant violation of copyright.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3760">6502freak</a> — Tue Mar 24, 2009 2:40 pm</p><hr />

1985 was over 20 years ago. For little fangames that anyone could possibly muster up over any medium, I highly doubt that they'll attract such a huge mob that it actually financially disrupts any of the commercial franchises they're based on. As such, there is *no* practical issue here, and likely never will be, to the point where worrying whether or not Nintendo is going to be breaking your door down for adding the Metroid powerup system to your game seems really ridiculous. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />That's just my opinion though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Tue Mar 24, 2009 12:32 pm</p><hr />
