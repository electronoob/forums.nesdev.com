Using an SPI is a better approach, however you still have to refresh the contents of the SPI send buffer after every transmission (or when the strobe is sent again at least). This is more workable but is still sensitive to timing.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3706">qbradq</a> — Tue Jun 28, 2011 11:50 am</p><hr />

This in and of itself isn't too hard, unless it's also trying to receive data and process packets too from the wireless interface.<br /><br />The 4021's at least are super cheap.

Yeah I'm not really trying to compete with adapters, and I don't claim to be cheap.  I've admitted before if you're looking to save money go with an adapter or do it yourself and I've recommended raphenet's site to a lot of people looking to make their own.  <br /><br />You have to realize how much time goes into making everything I do especially cleaning masses of controllers.   I started making some basic stuff awhile ago only making a few dollars each while my prices compared to adapters to see how they would sell, and I quickly became overloaded.  My only choice was to charge what would make it worth my time or quit.  <br /><br />I probably won't do finished controllers once I'm done with school, but it's a good flexible income for me right now.  <br /><br />My goal in posting up the fact I could make them and give $150-$200 price tag was not to advertise.  I was unclear what he was looking to pay $50 for and more so explaining what hardware like that would have to go for as finished deal.  Really anyone with the skills is much better off making something themselves, not to mention the personal reward that comes with DIY.   <br /><br />It would be nice if some big manufacturer made something like this so you could get everything for $50 like you're saying.  But honestly I doubt there is the enough market for it, and that's why no one's making them...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Sun Jun 26, 2011 8:13 pm</p><hr />

I'm willing to modify the code without charge, but there are a few things that will delay/prevent me from getting it done.<br /><br />*Learning enough PIC assembly to rewrite it for the NES, I'm really only familiar enough with AVR.<br /><br />*Time.  This project is really low on my totem pole.  Even if I were to get $50 or more to do it.  I don't really think it would be right to accept money to write the code.  Mainly because if there were issues someone ran into trying to implement the code I would have to provide support somehow or try to defend my work.  Neither of which seem appropriate for something like this.<br /><br />Plus it's not my code to start with so it wouldn't be right for me to try and make money off his work.<br /><br />If you know the slightest thing about assembly I would recommend learning PIC assembly yourself and taking it on as your own project!  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  It wouldn't be too hard and I'm sure you'd learn a lot.  Even if you didn't know a lick of assembly it would be a good place to start.<br /><br />The main problem with someone already knowing PIC assembly to modify the code is they most likely don't have the parts on hand to test out and debug the code on the actual hardware.  But it's entirely possible for someone to who's really good with it to get everything right the first time.  <br /><br />But like I also mentioned his code has a bug (at least it did for me) where you loose a packet from time to time and it makes it act like all the buttons are pressed when they actually aren't.  I'm not certain it's an issue with the code or that it's a lost/trash packet.  But with the analysis I've done thus far that's what I'm suspecting.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Sun Jun 26, 2011 5:28 pm</p><hr />

Are you saying you'd pay $50 for the changes to the code, labor, or parts labor and shipping?<br /><br />There is easily over $50 worth of parts when you think about things like the battery, charger, controller, and dongle.  Not to mention the labor.  My target price for these would be somewhere between $150-$200.  Keep in mind that also gives you a charger that's designed for the battery, not just a dc adapter that will cause the Lithium battery to explode in your hands.<br /><br />I know the price is steep and I wouldn't expect them to fly off the shelves nor would I have to time to make them all if they did.  If you're able and willing to do the work yourself after I get everything working and share the project it might be a better option.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Sun Jun 26, 2011 12:42 pm</p><hr />
