Sure, the consonants are all in the exact same positions, but &quot;suke&quot; and &quot;saku&quot; sound too different from each other to cause any sort of confusion IMO.

I've seen much better looking joints fail on arcade boards, so I will touch these up and do some continuity testing on the board to make sure it's getting to the proper pins. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">&quot;kyousuke&quot;?

I put the crappy 72 pin connector from the yardsale NES into my stock NES (after cleaning &amp; bending the pins upward slightly) and had about a 75% success rate with the same carts.  I'd say the NEW connector is crap and will be returned.  <br /><br />So, right now my plan is to do a bunch of soldering work on the yardsale mainboard and wait for my replacement 72 pin connector.   If I have anything further to post on the subject, I will plan to start a new thread to not further derail this one... sorry for the tons of posts that really don't have anything to do with the subject at hand, everyone.

Another thing capacitors don't like is having their traces cut, and I found 4 traces cut suspiciously close to pin#4 on the CIC.  While I don't have any recollection of this, the most logical explanation is I messed up and cut some traces while trying to cut pin#4 (I do not remember at all slipping/gouging the board/etc, but the evidence is there that it happened)... I got some wrapping wire and patched the traces up, put on my stock 72 pin connector, and the yardsale NES was booting up with a 100% success rate. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />    Then I put the new connector back on and games were booting with about 12.5% success rate... this piece of junk is going back for sure. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />The moral of the story here is:  don't be lazy and cut pins with a boxcutter even though the guy on youtube did it that way.  Get out the desoldering iron, or at least use the cutters you own that have proven themselves to be safe/handy for cutting pins in the past...<br /><br />Edited to add: Not only did repairing these traces cause unbootable games to boot properly, the reset button works again.   I'm surprised ANY games were booting at all, considering the damage that had been done to the board...

Need to remember, a good handful (maybe even the majority of the games I tried) would indeed boot up, even with the cut traces.

Wired pin 4 to GND, and it wouldn't even give a red power light. Removed jumper wire, and left it floating. All is well. WTF? Anyway, it was a REV 07 board I believe. Only decks I have here now are 07s and 10s. Haven't had any others to test it on.
