		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys, I need some help trying to figure out something.
<br />
<br />I own a Universal Controller Adapter by a company called Game Elements. This very cool adapter converts Playstation 2 DuelShock, arcade stick or even PS1 controllers (including racing wheels) to work on Xbox, GameCube or Wii. 
<br />
<br /><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AA0cM1pQL.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Today  I just randomly got the idea to take it apart to look at its PCB and I was pleasantly surprised to see an unused but fully present USB trace. I got to thinking that it might be possible to add in a USB cord and have this thing work on a PC or even PS3.  
<br />
<br />I did some googling and came across a thread where someone else has apparently done just that. 
<br />

<br />I know USB is VCC 5v, GND, + Data and - Data, but my only problem is I'm not really sure where to solder the four wires that will lead to the USB connection. 
<br />
<br />Here are high res images of both sides of the controller adapter pcb. 
<br />
<br />Top side
<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/56076975@N02/6727683971/" class="postlink"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7017/6727683971_27635a663e_b.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />
<br />Bottom side
<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/56076975@N02/6727681305/" class="postlink"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7007/6727681305_15931f8b41_b.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I also know the Xbox Controller pinout closely mirrors USB. 
<br /><img src="http://mesh.typepad.com/hacks/xbox/usb_adapter/expansion_adapter.gif" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />This matches up nicely with the colors of the wires on the Xbox side of the adapter being Gray, Black, Yellow, Green, White Red. 
<br />
<br />I'm not sure why there's a Gray line, but it's bridged by solder with the Black and another connection for GameCube, so I assume that indicates those three traces all must be GND. 
<br />
<br />Further googling I found this in a tutorial on how to modify an Xbox 1 Controller to be a pure USB controller: 
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.stlflops.com/techemporium/xboxctrl/XBox-Pin-Outs-2.JPG" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Based on all this, I think I know where to solder the USB cable wires, but I'm a little unsure. This is what I'm thinking: 
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />Can anyone with more experience chime in and offer some help? The last thing I want to is hook up VCC somewhere incorrectly and have the thing die on me.
<br />
<br />Thanks.

<br />
<br />Do you have a multimeter?  you could always double check that you've got 5v from Vcc and Gnd right before plugging something in.  If it doesn't work as you planned you could try swapping D- and D+ but don't swap anything else.

<br />Who knows why those crazy Chinese do what they do! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  From what I've seen they are more motivated about saving money than functionality.  Could have been because PS3 controllers connect to PC (and PS3 obviously) so they might not have seen market benefit to spend 10cents on a USB connector.

<br />Even PCs running 64-bit Windows, which requires all input device drivers to have been digitally signed by a corporation? This comes from the triple whammy of lack of input device support in the user-mode driver framework (UMDF), the kernel-mode code signing (KMCS) policy in 64-bit versions of Windows Vista and Windows 7, and certificate authorities' general policy against selling KMCS certificates to individuals.

<br />
<br />It's possible I could be wrong about the PS3 controllers.  But I know I have tested this with aftermarket wired PS3 controllers.
<br />
<br />I don't really know about all the digital signing business like you're saying.  But I can say I've plugged dozens of homemade USB projects directly into my 64bit Windows 7 machine.  But they may be covered by all this with <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html" class="postlink">VUSB's certificates.</a>

<br />It's possible that some aftermarket wired PS3 controllers act like standard USB HID gamepads when connected to a PC. But I was under the impression that SIXAXIS or Dual Shock 3 controllers needed a special driver.

The Joystick HID class supports enough axes of analog for all the sticks and all the accelerometers (and even the analog buttons). The only idea that occurs to me is that since all the buttons are (opinion: uselessly) also analog axes, and that's not terribly useful to programs that expect them to be digital.
