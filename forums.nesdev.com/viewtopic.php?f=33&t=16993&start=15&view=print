It also makes me wish i had part in it (like any good game does). <br />This game is very pure. Has a lot of style. <br /><br />Only things i wish it had (it's not even nitpicks - it's a wish list from a fan):<br />-Three lives as not to scare away the easily discouraged.Maybe as easy/normal mode, with one life being hardcore mode. You'd still want to come back for a better score. This would help game owners encourage friends to dare play it if it starts at a casual level!<br /><br />-And medals! With graphics (however small in size) that feels rewarding to see. or lacking that, just maybe differently coloured text on your lap times as to signal &quot;try harder&quot; &quot;ok&quot; &quot;good&quot; &quot;great&quot;. <br /><br />-Maybe an even more differently looking second player although i love they share a similar taste in cool shades.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Finally getting around to playing some of the compo games this year, and gave both of yours a try. <br /><br />F-FF was kinda cool - not a style of game you see often on the NES. The controls felt quite responsive.<br /><br />Ii had a lot of fun with Star Evil. (Bet those are words that have never been said before this version!) I managed to get to the end after a few tries. There were a few good puzzles and the aesthetic really worked. The bomb thing was really cool, and the spots that triggered glitching were pretty entertaining. The checkpoints felt well-placed too - dying was unfortunate but never sent me back frustratingly far. Well done!

Seems to crash after menu selection...<br />But I played on FCEU and seemed fine. I like how colorful palette seemed to be.<br />Really cool concept, not your everyday homebrew idea, haha.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />Never mind, I updated AVS firmware and both games work fine now.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><strong>Star Evil: </strong><br />My praise for this concept has already been stated. It did start to lose my interest in the later portion a bit. I especially enjoyed the envelope and flame interaction and the concentric circle maze. Graphically, I would have made a lot of different decisions myself, but I don't think they'd necessarily be better. The only thing visually that turned me off was the hand-scrawled &quot;BK&quot; tiles.<br /><br /><strong>F-FF</strong>: <br /><ul><li>Absolutely love the menu screen and the driver designs</li><li> The title screen is visually impressive, but doesn't feel like it belongs with the gameplay or menu screen (perhaps color choice for the title screen could help?)</li><li>It would have benefited from a visual indicator of the 2-player option. I don't feel there's any reward for keeping this mode hidden.</li><li> Infinite respawns during 2-player mode. This really is a must for the game to be enjoyed by players of varying skill levels, and I'd say that since the modern NES market skews toward an older crowd, the second player will often be children, spouses, other non-gamers (But even if not, continuing to play after your couch mate has been killed isn't enjoyable for either player.) Moreover, the time lost from a respawn is enough motivation to keep it competitive.</li><li>Is there any way at all to get varying sized sprites drawn instead of the arrow for the other player?</li></ul>
