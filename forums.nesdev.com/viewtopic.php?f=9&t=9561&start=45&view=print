The pixel's stabilization should be visible through the transparent latch, which can then be used to differentiate between background and sprite. Even if the multiplexer isn't reset each pixel the state can be synchronized to rendering. (Or if you absolutely had to you could detect the asymmetric propagation.)<br /><br />Edit: ahhhhhh totally missed the intercepting PPU data part

That's pretty cool, if we're at that point then all that's left to do is decide what format(s) to output to.  Would it be possible to get digital audio from a nes somehow?  I don't think the cpu ever outputs digital audio data, but then again I didn't know the ppu can output its data digitally so who knows.

But still, any news on getting this turned in to a board? any guesses on a big/general price range? Would love to know these details and follow this projects development.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />IMNSHO, it adds a little richness and doesn't sound bad <em>iff</em> the stereo separation is very slight. Maybe 3dB difference at max.<br /><br />In a stupid augmentation way, if you have an upscaling HDMI output, it would be nifty to add full quadraphonic support (unfortunately, necessarily by emulating the APU).<br /><br />In any case, itemizing this out: a non-upscaling version would need a fairly small PCB, a few sockets, a CPLD/FPGA with enough room for 192 bits of RAM and 13kbit of ROM. It looks like something like Lattice's cheapest FPGAs with level shifters might be the best call; they have enough memory to get you upscaling for free.<br /><br />I'd probably give up on a &quot;real&quot; video DAC and just use a bunch of 5-bit R-2R DACs and opamp buffers—I can't find any &quot;real&quot; DACs that support the necessary bandwidth (11MS/s) for a remotely competitive price.<br /><br />For connectors, VGA natively allows hotplug detection (pullup in the generator on ID0/pin 11, pulled to ground by the monitor), and for component RCA connectors are sold that allow hotplug detection. Looks like s-video's SOL for insert detection.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Given that the low bit resolution of NES audio output, it wouldn't be hard to recover bit-perfect output from the NES. The only snag is that it runs at a 1.79 MHz sampling rate, so you'd need a video ADC to capture it. And there's not much you could do with it that would make sense; you'd either feed it back to a DAC, or downsample it to 44.1/48/96 kHz.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Definitely you'd use the pair of audio outputs from the 2A03. I see that the mixing of those involves 12K and 20K resistors, fed to an amplifier made of an inverter, so it's somewhat high-impedance and thus the RCA output is noise prone. Plus the high-pass capacitor makes it much harder to decode the absolute DAC levels. Maybe what's wanted here is just a better audio output mixer/amplifier section, rather than recovery of the digital signal.

Does your circuit mix in pins 45 / 46 of the famicom cartridge slot so games with added audio chips still get the audio mixed in?
