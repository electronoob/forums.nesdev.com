I could see such a thing working, but many tunes will also relocate code in memory, uncompressing before playback.<br /><br />I ended up going with a 512K battery backed SRAM.  64K of this was used for the "virtual C64" memory arena that I executed out of, and the remainder was used as a smallish RAM drive to store the tunes.  On selection, it'd clear the first 64K of RAM, then load the SID tune into RAM and run it from there.<br /><br />To make a good job of it,  you also have to support the registers at 0000h and 0001h for bankswitching, too (this allows you to turn off the C64's kernal and basic ROMs, as well as unmapping the IO (SID chip, etc) since some tunes store data here).  Supporting the CIA timer (generally, just a 16 bit timer mapped in at 0314h and 0315h).<br /><br />I ended up using an external PLL chip (4046) and a divide by 64 (4040) chip to make a *64 PLL, which I fed from one of the PIC's timers.  This allowed for PAL and NTSC speed selection, and produced the approx. 1MHz clock for the SID chips.  This clock was fed back into the PIC, and operated another 16 bit timer which was used to time the music playback code, allowing for SID tune selectable CIA rates.  It also fed the 3rd PIC timer which was used to run the PCM digi engine.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=230">kevtris</a> — Wed Jun 29, 2011 8:54 am</p><hr />

I remember thinking it would be cool to do that with the PIC18F452 on the original Squeedo board.  The slow speed of it compared to just using PIC18F asm made me figure it a low priority, but I thought if I had released that cart, it would have been an easy way for developers to speed their programs up without rewriting it much (using it as a co-processor).<br /><br />With the (eventual) rev3 Squeedo it will be lot more interesting, because I'm pretty sure the MCU (w/ MIPS32 @ 80Mhz) would be able to emulate it faster than the NES CPU runs.  Why not put the whole game there? <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />So yeah I think something like that, if a cart had an MCU as a coprocessor could be interesting.  It would still better to just write native code though, and use the speed for something. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Jun 28, 2011 5:53 pm</p><hr />

That, and you can probably find some on ebay too, either standalone or inside something (yeah, it only hurts a little while, hehe).  Actually there are probably random PCBs with 6502's and other older useful chips on them available.<br /><br />As for emulating the 6502 on a micro, I actually did do that back in 2001 or so on a PIC16F877 and later on a PIC18F452.  The purpose was for playing SID tunes.  It ended up working pretty decently.  An NSF player might be cool done in a similar fashion, but generating the audio might need a second microcontroller, since I suspect it'd take quite a bit of horsepower to do so.<br /><br />On the SID emulator though I did manage to play the digi stuff using the PIC while it emulated the C64 and 6502 and everything else.  That was on a 38.18MHz PIC so an AVR shouldn't have much issues.  <br /><br />Of course it was not cycle accurate at all, but this wasn't a concern for SID tunes and it isn't a concern for NSFs.   You might be able to get away with less than full speed operation (maybe even 20% to 30% full speed) for NSFs since they are designed to take up maybe 5-10% max of the CPU time per frame.<br /><br />I ended up emulating a 6800 and 8085 later on using the same 18F452 for a speech synthesizer and a product at work, respectively.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=230">kevtris</a> — Tue Jun 28, 2011 9:12 am</p><hr />

I personally can't think of a use for this other than to build a clone, but that's not the easiest way to do it.  I seriously doubt you could match the cycle times well enough to connect it to a 2C02 and have it work, which is why up till now people have used FPGA for this.  But don't let me deter you, I've been wrong before...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29">teaguecl</a> — Tue Jun 28, 2011 8:58 am</p><hr />
