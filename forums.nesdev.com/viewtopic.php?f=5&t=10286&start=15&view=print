One of those roommates has moved to Japan (and many times throughout Japan), and the other two still reside here in Silicon Valley.<br /><br />The game dev industry today operates still much like it did in the 80s: high stress environments due to deadlines and crummy managers, limited finances to actually improve the things that need improving (better artists, more play testers, better workstations or build clusters to make compiling take less time), and -- probably the most important of all -- just a general dislike of the games companies are working on.<br /><br />The place I worked at consisted of dudes who enjoyed working on their own side projects or (in one case) a fun/neat commercial game -- but at the same time they had 3 other games being developed, all at the request of bigger conglomerates.  The other 3 games were boring as hell, and every single division -- programming, art/graphics, sound/music, playtesting/usability, and some other group who I just describe as &quot;general&quot; (similar to usability) -- dreaded working on those 3 titles.  Everyone was mopey, stressed out, and just hated those games in general.  One short story involved the main sound engine coder/musician who absolutely hated working on the music engine for this one upcoming title -- it was flaky and a PITA to engineer because of what the game needed/wanted, so when he got stressed out he'd take a break for a few days (!) working on his own stuff like an Asteroid clone backed by tracks from a singer <s>whose name I can&#39;t remember &#40;quite a popular guy in past eras but pushed out really awful music, IMO&#41;</s> -- edit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBdSqk78nHw" class="postlink">Tom Jones</a> -- and at overamped volumes.<br /><br />What I'm trying to say here is that a game developers personal interest in something plays a humongous role in regards to the quality of work they do.  In a way, they're a lot like romhackers -- you have one or two guys who are passionate about a specific game, and their morale remains high because they have a personal interest in what they're doing -- but if you involve folks who don't have that same driving force or interest, they get burnt out quickly and end up disliking what they're doing.  Will they get the final product done?  Yeah, probably, but it'll be one of those &quot;okay it works, ship it&quot; games rather than a title that really makes people go &quot;wow, this is almost a work of art&quot;.<br /><br />This is why there are so many independent gamedev companies in Japan who big guys (Nintendo, etc.) often &quot;sub&quot; their work out to -- those companies do the coding/etc. and once the title is done, the contract is over and they no longer have to deal with the game.  In a manner of speaking, it means that there's always a light at the end of the tunnel no matter how bad the game (and the company can always refuse a bid).  This approach also exists in North America but I tend to find most of the American companies consisting of guys who just basically bang on keys and churn out code that's crap and then say &quot;give us the money, now go away&quot;.  I see this with smaller European (especially eastern) outfits too.</span>

The cost of living in California is fairly high (esp. San Francisco), but the lower paid jobs in the industry tend to be filled by locals who are already used to paying that high cost, and for the higher paid jobs I don't think it's as big an issue. There are also (fewer) companies in places where the cost of living is fairly low, like CD Projekt in Poland.

In fact, there was a <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/story/13/07/10/195238/india-to-overtake-us-on-number-of-developers-by-2017" class="postlink">Slashdot article</a> about this situation (well, sort of -- if you read the comments you'll see lots of people touch base on this fact; <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3959071&amp;cid=44244409" class="postlink">great example</a> -- the key word in that example is &quot;retention&quot;).<br /><br />It's shit like this that makes me feel like I'm a dying breed of engineer: I'm not ancient and there are many guys who know way, *way* more than I do (many of whom are my own idols), but in doing what I do for over 20 years (and the time frame in which I was learning matters greatly -- 1990 to present), there are certain things you just learn as guidelines that many younger folks don't live by because they haven't experienced it yet.  Not saying &quot;older is better&quot; at all -- just saying those of us who have been on the battlefield for 20+ years tend to have scars and memories that those only there for 4-5 do not.  For us &quot;seasoned&quot; UNIX guys, <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/t/unix/nine-traits-the-veteran-unix-admin-276" class="postlink">most of these are spot on</a> (I do disagree with one of them however).<br /><br />I can apply the same concept to gaming -- take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE4KZZ0jE8I" class="postlink">today's generation playing Super Mario World hacks</a>.  If you watch the guy play, you'll realise he definitely hasn't played SMW all the way through or gone through it a few times -- all while constantly complaining about the gameplay (the fact he can't figure out how the little red triangles with smilies work for running up walls just baffles my mind).  There's just something about techno-involved youth today that scares me, and on a separate level, something about technology (especially today) that I do not like.  That's why the HP Lovecraft quote on my home page is so applicable to me -- I'm a technophobe who works with technology.</span>

If that group is really large (e.g. Indians), then the amount of poor developers from that group is going to be proportionately large.<br /><br />I spent a few years at Sony as an on-site consultant, and in certain areas (e.g. kernel, device drivers, graphics, power save) you'd always find a substantial amount of consultants from former Soviet countries, like Ukraine, Belarus and Latvia. Many of them seemed quite capable. At the same time I've seen people of my own nationality (i.e. Swedes) who were incapable of writing syntactically correct code and/or failed to understand the semantics of the most trivial pieces of code. I've seen Indians, Japanese and Chinese alike upload changes with glaring memory leaks or segmentation faults waiting to happen. My biggest &quot;WTF?&quot; moment ever was actually when dealing with an American company, although I suspect that they had outsourced the development to someone abroad (it didn't say who the author was).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I work for a fortune 500 company in information systems. I develop in-house software to meet our business needs. Most of the time this means being the technical lead for a group of contractors, although I do write quite a bit of code myself (it saves a lot of budget).<br /><br />My office is one of the most culturally diverse acres in the states. I work with people from dozens of countries from every continent (except Antarctica). The commonality I find is not nationality, it is that code quality increases as you have more skin in the game.<br /><br />For me, I hope to work here until I retire a dried up, penniless husk of a man. So when I'm working on a product with an expected lifespan of 15 years, I want to make sure it's a quality product. I know I'm going to have to deal with this thing for the next 15 years. A contractor who's going to be done with it the moment the ink is dry doesn't have that same motivation to ensure the product is correct, stable, robust and maintainable. Their only motivation is to pass user acceptance testing.<br /><br />We've implemented new workflows over the past few years that have really improved this however. The biggest change was that our IS division is now ran like an external software development house. Other divisions of the company pay us (in inter-corporate fun-money) for a product, and we as an external entity hire contractors to help us with the work (if it doesn't involve trade secrets that is). That way the development leadership are the ones signing off on the contractor's deliverables, not our business guys.<br /><br />Before we did it this way our business was paying the contractors fees and the IS division had technical leadership roles (or development roles in the case of trade secret or competitive advantage projects). The contractors would delver crap code, the business would test the product and see that it basically did what they want, the IS guys would howl that the code was crap and un-maintainable, the business would sign off on the contract anyway and then proceed to complain for the lifetime of the product about defects and the inability of the IS department to deliver on feature requests.<br /><br />As a final note, I write language compilers and 6502 assembly to keep my mind sharp. What I do for a living certainly does not fulfill that need, but that's not why I do it. I love my company. I have since well before I worked for them, and they treat me very well.

I'm looking toward working in real time embedded systems once I graduate (using micro-controllers, FPGA, real-time signal processing and this kind of stuff). Hopefully I'll find a job who will satisfy me next year when I'll graduate. I'm currently <em>way</em> overqualified for the work I do at my internship (I do stuff I'd probably have enjoyed doing back when I was 15, but now I find it quite tasteless).<br /><br />I know I could probably use my NESdev experience as an argument and try to enter into the videogame industry, but I don't plan to do that for multiple reasons :<br /><ul>* Don't want to make games for someone else without having the opportunity to express myself<br />* No serious games made in my country and I don't want to move to another country<br />* No interest at all in &quot;modern&quot; games<br /></ul><br />I'd also mention that I'm a musician and I enjoy doing this as much as I do my job. I wanted to become a professional musician when I was little but now I'm glad I didn't take this route because while this is cool, the competition is incredibly high and doing any art at professional level sucks anyways for many reasons.
