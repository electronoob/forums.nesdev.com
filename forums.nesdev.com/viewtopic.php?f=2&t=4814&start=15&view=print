If someone calls rNES_waitvblank(), he expects to have about 8 units of time to do PPU operations. If you don't clear the flag before waiting in the loop, and rNES_waitvblank() is called in near the end of vblank, it will return immediately, and the caller will have far fewer than 8 units of time; worst-case, he could have no time, with vblank ending occurring just as rNES_waitvblank() finishes.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Wow that [binary macro] was twisted.</div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Blargg, about your suggestion for rNES_waitvblank(), this function does what its name says, if you are actually at vblank, and you want to "wait for vblank", well, the result is you wait nothing.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I think the programmer won't be just waiting for vblank, usually what he'll do is a loop that does anything else while waiting for vblank, as decompressing some data or calculating something, right?
<br />
<br />For those people who actually made or are making some game for NES, do you usually wait for vblank doing nothing, or use that time to do something else?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree with Blargg.  waitvblank() should wait for the start of vblank.  If you're already in vblank it should wait until the start of the next vblank, rather than return immediately.
<br />
<br />The programmer will wait for VBlank for two reasons:
<br />
<br />1)  It regulates the logic flow of the game.  Since VBlank comes 60 times a second, you do one logic step -- then wait for another frame (vblank), then do another logic step, then wait for a frame, etc.  This produces a steady gameflow.
<br />
<br />One problem with waitvblank returning immediately is -- what if the game doesn't have very much logic to do?  Say for example the game is waiting for user input before continuing.  Like at a title screen or something where it's waiting for the Start button to be pressed.  And for kicks, say there's a little sprite that animates on the screen.
<br />
<br />Code might look something like:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">while&#40;!start_button_pressed&#41;<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; rNES_waitvblank&#40;&#41;;<br />&nbsp; animate_and_draw_sprite&#40;&#41;;<br />&nbsp; update_joy&#40;&#41;;<br />&#125;<br /></div><br /><br />This is very practical (and typical in a game).  The game would expect animate_and_draw_sprite to be called once per frame, which would result in a steady animation framerate of 60 FPS.  If it's called more often than that, the animation would be faster than expected.<br /><br />So what happens if animate_and_draw_sprite() and update_joy() are shorter than the VBlank period?  This would result in rNES_waitvblank returning immediately rather than waiting for the next frame, which would disrupt the 60 FPS animation speed.<br /><br /><br />2)  The other reason to wait for VBlank is to wait for a time where you can draw stuff to the screen.  This is the reason blargg was talking about.<br /><br />Once VBlank happens, you know you have X amount of time to get drawing done.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">rNES_waitvblank&#40;&#41;;<br />DoABunchOfDrawing&#40;&#41;;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />DoABunchOfDrawing might assume that it has X time to get all its drawing done -- however if rNES_waitvblank returns immediately (in the middle of or near the end of vblank), you'll be hosed... since you don't have the expected X time to finish drawing -- you have much less.  As a result, drawing code might spill outside of vblank, resulting in all kinds of horrible graphic glitches.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">For those people who actually made or are making some game for NES, do you usually wait for vblank doing nothing, or use that time to do something else?</div>
<br />
<br />The whole point of calling a wait() funciton is that you have nothing else to do.  You can't do something else while waiting.. or else you're not waiting.
<br />
<br />That said -- there are times you might want NMI/Vblank to interrupt code that's running.  For example, if an NMI occurs while you're updating game logic, you'll know your code is running long and you have to do some kind of slowdown to keep up.
<br />
<br />Therefore games might be interested in VBlank notification outside of waiting for vblank.  However they would not use a wait() function for this.

<br />rNES_waitvblank() reads $2002 for bit 7, and that read clears the bit until the next vblank.
<br />Suppose one loop's logic takes too long, so you call rNES_waitvblank() inside the vblank time, and the next loop takes less time, so the interval between the two calls to rNES_waitvblank() would be less than one 60th of a second, making the animation go faster than it should, but that is only for one frame.
<br />If rNES_waitvblank() checked $2002 once before making the loop to wait for another vblank, and it was called inside the vblank period, then the program would be inactive for more than a 60th of a second, which will also make the animation out of sync.
<br />
<br />Anyway, there's also this:
<br />rNES_VBlank( PPU_status )
<br />which checks for the vblank flag, but doesn't wait for it, so you can use it in your own loop.

<br />
<br />In that case, I would recommend removing the function completely, as this is a very unreliable way to wait for vblank and might be the source of many glitches and errors in games as a result of them using it.
<br />
<br />The only time you need to (or should) examine $2002.7 in a game would be at startup when you're waiting for the PPU to warm up -- and a rNES_waitforwarmup() function or something of that sort seems more practical for this kind of thing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, this is a library, so the programmer could choose to use its functions or code their own. For some reason, the NES, appart from firing the NMI each vblank, sets $2002.7, it's there for you to read it, if you want, so my library makes it available with a macro.
<br />
<br />I might as well remove rNES_waitvblank() as it's one of the first things I coded and just does the same as waitvblank() from the cc65 NES library.
<br />
<br />In the demo, what actually takes place is this:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;while&#40; true &#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;PPU_status = rNES_PPU_status&#40;&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;if&#40; rNES_sprite0hit&#40; PPU_status &#41; &#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;rNES_scroll&#40;sx,0&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;if&#40; rNES_VBlank&#40; PPU_status &#41; &#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;break;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#125;</div>
<br />I could add a $2002 read before the loop as sugested.
<br />But checking for sprite 0 hit or doing some other things before vblank, make rNES_waitvblank() pretty useless anyway.
<br />
<br />I'm aware that the better way to do this is NMI, but I haven't yet figured out how to hook a routine to an interrupt in C.
<br />If someone has any clue, please tell me. Anyway, using NMI would be something the programmer should take care about, the library couldn't handle it in any useful way I think.
