		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, I fired up Faxanadu and I noticed that game has a pretty interesting way to show text during gameplay in a way that doesn't eat up too much of the available CHR but having a full ASCII(?) fontstet in the data that's being copied into 64 tiles of CHR-RAM.<br />I think it's a pretty cool way to display text that can be exploited even more than Faxanadu does it by making smaller fonts like I did in the included ROM, which save up even more font space in the CHR while allowing for longer strings of text. Also, it can technically display up to 256 chars that are 4 bytes long in size (compressed of course) which is always nice <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />What do you think of this technique? Are there any other games where this technique is used? Discuss

You can double it by reserving two palettes for it (e.g. black + two whites) but that's a big imposition. If it's just for small text bubbles though, it has the potential to work really nicely?<br /><br />Super Bat Puncher does do it, restricted to small boxes but also monospaced. (I'm not sure if Miau was considering variable width font but never ended up implementing it?)<br /><br />I think there are some Chinese pirate/translation games that do it for more characters (like Faxanadu).<br /><br /><br />Romancia (Famicom) is the only commercial era game that I know of that did a variable width font (in a small box). <em>Edit: was incorrect, an English translation hack in 2008 implemented the variable width font. Romancia is fixed width, but still rendered to CHR-RAM.</em>

But then it's easier on Super NES for about four reasons: more CHR RAM, DMA to CHR RAM, no temptation to use CHR ROM, and the MMIO multiplier can be (ab)used as a shifter to get each glyph into place.<br /><br />The <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=136105#p136105" class="postlink">Action 53</a> menu and my ports of <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=135324#p135324" class="postlink">robotfindskitten</a> and <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=157634#p157634" class="postlink">240p Test Suite</a> use the same VWF routine as RHDE.

Also, most systems lacks enough VRAM to store all kanjis used in a game simultaneously anyway - which is a 2nd reason painting to VRAM on the fly was not really an option anymore as game started to get better dialogue and needed kanjis.

It was the <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/translations/1264/" class="postlink">English translation hack</a> that made the font variable width.<br /><br />So, it's not actually an example of variable width font in a commercial era NES/Famicom game, though it might possibly be its earliest use on the NES anyway?

Twice--once at 2bpp and once at 4bpp. Early SNES games that didn't have a lot of graphics to begin with could afford to be pretty wasteful with VRAM.<br /><br />Dynamically-loaded fonts are very common in Game Boy games, although few of them use kanji or sizes other than 8x8 (an example of one that <em>does</em> is Super Robot Wars 2G, which has 12x16 kanji and 8x16 everything else) Ages ago I wrote an ASM hack for a GB translation that I don't think was ever finished or released (it was some other game I can't remember, not SRW) that changed a dynamic font into a half-static half-dynamic one in order to get more text on the screen at once. The way it worked was I loaded the most common lowercase English letters statically and all other characters dynamically, so you could have as much text onscreen as you wanted as long as no more than n characters were uncommon or uppercase. Naturally, the character encoding was out-of-order and put all the static characters together, in order to simplify the static-or-dynamic test.<br /><br />The Korean versions of Pokemon Gold and Silver are GBC-only whereas all other language versions are compatible with the original GB. The reason is that the Korean versions use a dynamic hangul font and they need the GBC's second bank of VRAM for it.

The decompression process is a bit on the slow side, but you can't argue with an 8KB image reduced to an average of 1024 bytes or less, can you? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />(The images are mostly cell-shaded, which really helps this particular compression scheme, as it was designed for it.)
