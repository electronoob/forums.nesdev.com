<br />Ok,i was able to apply Music Driver to my game,however...i just get empty screen with music playing!
<br />Later,i was able to make my game play,but...music was gone(Except for "BEEEEPP" sound...) any ideas how i should put games code to make it working with game?
<br />(Later,when BBEEP sound appeared I noticed that NMI is executed only ONCE,no idea WHY...)

In the sample I gave, there is good chance the settings for the mapper are wrong for PRG ones since only one bank is set and emulators didn't complain about it.  
<br />
<br />From what I understand of your message, once you move code around either the music work or the game. This mean while the game is running, there is good chances that the wrong bank was selected in the region were the code doesn't work.
<br />
<br />I did one sample in the past for VRC6 and tested on hardware but I don't think it was for nesasm. I can't find it anymore. So for now I don't know how to set properly the banks in nesasm then set VRC6 mapper settings.  This is probably the only issue.

<br />
<br />But how is your program set?  All code is in the fixed bank, driver included? I just want to have a better understanding of location of data/code and maybe I could (or someone else) figure out what is better to do in that case.

<br />For the song, I didn't import it: I did a cover of the song only.  I found the DPCM drum that someone extracted (Maybe it was Bucky if my memory is good) and tried to make it as faithful as the original.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />HI!
<br />I was about 7 month since I was doing anything in DRD(Dizzy Rainy Day).
<br />The problem was that I'm bad at grafic making,and game development was halted...
<br />But miracle happend-About week ago one guy responded to my request and said that he will make some grafics.
<br />I'm back with development.(Actually I returned with it today,after seeing first grafic..)
<br />But there's another reason for me to write a post here:
<br />Of course,I have a roblem.
<br />And yes,It's music driver.
<br />Last time music was playing really good,now it's playing same,however,back then I wasn't  doing anything serious about music.
<br />Now I have really nice remix of Yolkfolk village.
<br />The problem?
<br />Sound driver plays VRC6 channels incorrectly.
<br />It plays fine in Banshaku sample,but not in mine game...
<br />Maybe I shouldn't post it-There's a little chance of finding why it happens without source code,however...ONLY VRC6 channels are glitched,other "normal" channels plays fine.
<br />I was trying to solve it by myself,but I miserably failed.
<br />Maybe there's some kind of glitch that is known by community?
<br />And,I was using Famitracker 3.0 to build bin files,not latest one.
<br />Can anyone help?

<br />Maybe Banshaku can help.
<br />The strange thing-just after RESET interrupt I init music and then make infinte loop...and music is still messed...
<br />This mean that code of my game is not colliding with music driver(right?)
<br />And I don't use IRQ...
<br />hmm..NMI also don't mess it up...so why..?
<br />(Maybe I should provide whole source code?...but it may be a lot of work with checking it..)
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />ARGHHH!!
<br />I fixed it...
<br />Just don't laugh at me,ok...?
<br />I never seen it in Famitracker documentation,but i gave it a try-
<br />Music driver is NOT compatible with mapper 26(I'm using mapper 26...)ONLY with 24.
<br />I changed mapper number and it started to work,magic?
<br />Yeah,it's a little funny-i lost whole day,but at least learned something:)
