Hehe I decided to do probably what many people were thinking and just quit it, I wouldn't feel good selling it since it seem to be working and then not working and I figured no pirate cart is worth that much trouble (specially not for the high bid of 71$ I got for it). I wasted too much time trying (and more importantly, wasted yours!) to get it to work, we almost managed to fix it but it's not 100% so I would feel dishonest to sell it. The game is fun but at this price people can easily get a repro. I'll desolder everything and maybe use the cart to learn a bit like try to copy the pcb in eagle and make it accept 32 pin eprom and who know, maybe try to reproduce the mapper on a CPLD as a learning project. I just wanted to thanks you all for all the help, it was very much appreciated and I managed to learn alot just by reading all your answer and fiddling with it and that's probably worth 70$!<br /><br />Rest in peace venerable pirate Japanese cart! You fought well till the end!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4859">SkinnyV</a> — Mon Jun 06, 2011 9:55 pm</p><hr />

A hard reset will typically reset a flip flop, perhaps putting it the correct state. It's hard to believe the cart has so many problems, it's a rather straight forward design.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Mon Jun 06, 2011 9:02 pm</p><hr />

Thats could not be a bug, it used to work without issue before.

The only possibility is that it was a CPU data line passing through a PRG ROM via. The data bus feeds the 7474 register which feeds the MUX (likely 7400) which feeds VRAM A10. As for the new problem, the hack could have a bug.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Mon Jun 06, 2011 7:43 pm</p><hr />

Major breakthrough, I had desoldered the prg yesterday to trace back some of the address line and re soldered it today seeing as this was already dumped by Kevin and, low and behold, the mirroring issue was gone! But here where it get weirder, I didn't have time to get too excited before noticing the scrolling issue come back once I use the build it level selector! But if I progress normally to the second stage for example everything is ok. I switch to level 2 with level selector and bam, mirroring issue again. I'm baffled.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4859">SkinnyV</a> — Mon Jun 06, 2011 7:30 pm</p><hr />

That’s a very cool work around Kevin, thanks for the information, this pretty much answer my question! As for the game being dumped, I'll have to look further because I couldn't find a mention about it online. If you did dump it, I don't see the point on doing it again if not as a learning experience: D I got to say, this board is full of very knowledgeable and helpful people. Sometime I wonder where all of you nintendo genius work at during the day and if the experience you got from those nintendo project give you some kind of edge in your field.<br /><br />Edit: Ok, I guess I found it on goodnes.db, I wonder why people are not trying to make repro with that ROM instead seeing as it only require a couple of TTL logic chip. I'm confused because I saw that thenesdump.com are doing a repro using mapper 5 and I didn't think it would be possible to make repro using an american cart for a game that was using VRC 4.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4859">SkinnyV</a> — Mon Jun 06, 2011 12:32 pm</p><hr />

Then I usually write a mapper document so that it can be emulated.  I always use copynes for this, so that means there is usually a mapper plugin for it also to dump the cartridge without having to take it apart or desolder anything.<br /><br />Anyways, you asked in an email about what kind of ROM it is.  I'm pretty sure it's a 28 pin, 128K byte ROM chip.  This will not be easily dumpable using an EPROM programmer unless it supports dumping these kinds of ROM.  My EPROM programmer (ancient thing) has a setting called "23C1024 MASK ROM - dump only" which allows it to dump these ROMs.<br /><br />They have the same pinout as a 27512, except /OE is turned into A16.  This means they only have a single enable in the usual place where /CE is on a 27512.  A0-A15 and D0-D7 all are on the same pins as on a 27512.<br /><br />one way to dump them is to gently bend A16 (pin 22) out a bit so it doesn't go into the programmer socket, then solder a wire from that to ground (pin 14)  dump as a 27512,  then move the wire from ground to VCC (pin 28) and dump it again.

I was wondering how it was working... Does the main rom contain both the PRG and CHR and transfer the CHR data to the ram when you turn on the nes? I thought all nes cart were the same with 1 PRG and 1 CHR chip. Does it mean this cart's CHR is only 8k or does it transfer chunk when needed and refresh? And since I am interested in having this dumped in the future (since it's different than any other version available), let's say I complete the pin out of the rom chip which would be pretty easy (already did about 7 address line), would I be able to just read the content of the chip with a eprom reader and voila or the data would be mixed up because the mapper wouldn't have organized the data? And if i was to try to dump it, what chip profile could i use to read it ? Most 128k rom chip i know are in 32 dip package and not 28. Do you guy know of any supported chip (for a willem reader or the like) that is 128k and 28 pin?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4859">SkinnyV</a> — Sun Jun 05, 2011 10:31 pm</p><hr />
