<br />
<br />I still need to order the Frogger port cart from RetroUSB too...that's high on my list, although I'd rather have it as a bright green Famicom cart. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Maybe I'll order one, dump it, burn the ROMs to a Famicom cart and have some fun with that. (No, I won't be selling them.) I wonder what FC cart it'd be compatible with in order to ensure success...
<br />
<br />I'd like to see an Asteroids or Tempest or even a Lunar Lander homebrew...with arcade-style emulated vector <span class="posthilit">graphics</span> of course. Those would be brill!
<br />
<br />Has anybody considered giving any of those classics a try?

<br />Are you thinking of polishing the game to make it more NES-like and less 2600-like so that we have a proper Pitfall for the NES?
<br />
<br />That would be so awesome, as Pitfall was one of my favourites on ther 2600 and "Super Pitfall" for the NES was a real let-down...!

There will be an MMC1 version, but the only difference is that it'll backup the custom level data and score tables to SRAM.
<br />
<br />In the past I tried to recruit someone for the music/soundfx, but for whatever reason, nothing ever came of it. Though if anyone is interested, drop me a PM.

<br />
<br />Right, 'Super Pitfall' is what they released for the NES. What I'm saying is that it would be nice to have a full port of Pitfall for the NES with updated <span class="posthilit">graphics</span> and sound. 
<br />
<br />What about the Frogger NES port that's on RetroUSB.com? SEGA owns the rights to Frogger, and they haven't sued the pants off of the guy who did the homebrew, even though it's an almost identical game. As long as he doesn’t use any code from Pitfall to write his game and names it something different, Activision's case will be merely air if they choose to take any action at all. 
<br />
<br />Pitfall isn't the only game of its style ever made; it’s just the best of them for the 2600. Where is the infringement in writing a new game that plays like the Atari version of Pitfall with completely new <span class="posthilit">graphics</span> and ASM?

<br />The problem occurs when either patents apply (true for In the Groove, not true for a Pitfall clone) or the "completely new <span class="posthilit">graphics</span>" aren't new enough and aren't "scenes a faire". As I understand it, the court decided <em>Atari v. Philips</em> in favor of Namco and Atari because the Munchkin character wasn't different enough from Pac-Man.

<br />
<br />I have a newer version that was never released that I'll post when I get home. Nothing major, animations are smoother (somewhat), level data can be sent to the cart via a 232 cable (thanks Memblers), and a few other minor things.
