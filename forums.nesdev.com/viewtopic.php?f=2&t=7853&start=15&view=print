		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here's a complete description of how I've demodulated the NES's video output by hand-
<br />
<br />We tell the NES to this 
<br /><img src="http://eamp.org/li/ntsc/8x-pixels.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />It generates the following signal 
<br /><img src="http://eamp.org/li/ntsc/8x-phase.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Off the left hand of the screen, we get a cue of what phase 8 is (red here is phase 6)
<br />
<br />We demodulate I and Q from that. GIMP doesn't support negative colors, so I have to demodulate all four quadrants separately: 
<br />I+ <img src="http://eamp.org/li/ntsc/8x-ipl.png" alt="Image" />, I- <img src="http://eamp.org/li/ntsc/8x-imi.png" alt="Image" />, Q+ <img src="http://eamp.org/li/ntsc/8x-qpl.png" alt="Image" />, Q- <img src="http://eamp.org/li/ntsc/8x-qmi.png" alt="Image" /> 
<br />and then add them back together: 
<br />I <img src="http://eamp.org/li/ntsc/8x-i.png" alt="Image" /> and Q <img src="http://eamp.org/li/ntsc/8x-q.png" alt="Image" />. 
<br />Note that I has a bandwidth of 1.5MHz (24 pixels) and Q has a bandwidth of &lt;700kHz (&gt;48 pixels)
<br />
<br />We could just lowpass our input at 4.3MHz, which basically won't get rid of much of the chroma-into-luma crosstalk, and it looks like this: 
<br /><img src="http://eamp.org/li/ntsc/8x-y43.png" alt="Image" />, 
<br />and you end up with 
<br /><img src="http://eamp.org/li/ntsc/8x-compose.png" alt="Image" /> at the end.
<br />
<br />One of the earlier techniques invented to reduce this crosstalk is to subtract I and Q back from the input signal. We remodulate our calculated I and Q 
<br />(I+ <img src="http://eamp.org/li/ntsc/8x-ripl.png" alt="Image" /> Q+ <img src="http://eamp.org/li/ntsc/8x-rqpl.png" alt="Image" /> I- <img src="http://eamp.org/li/ntsc/8x-rimi.png" alt="Image" /> Q- <img src="http://eamp.org/li/ntsc/8x-rqmi.png" alt="Image" />)
<br /> *EDIT I forgot 4 of the 8 products, they're not shown here, but the two results below now include them
<br />and subtract it from the input. Because the NES produced too sharp an edge on the sides, this color trap isn't particularly effective on verticals  and the result only looks like 
<br /><img src="http://eamp.org/li/ntsc/8x-ry43.png" alt="Image" /> 
<br />We then lowpass at 4.3MHz (we still know per the spec that there's nothing valid above) and do the colorspace transform and get

(Actually, I eyeballed it and used a 24 pixel wide gaussian.) The gaussian isn't quite right -- a sinc or high-order chebychev is probably more authentic, but the gaussian has the advantage that it's symmetrically noncausal (unlike the chebychev or boxcar "motion blur") so I don't need to worry about group delay and it's natively supported in GIMP.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I really appreciate the diagrams, thanks guys.
<br />Apparently the TVs uses a band-cut filter (as opposed to lowpass filter) for luma, which mans resolution higher than 3.5 MHz can happen as long as the hue (I and Q) are the same. However luma's harmonics close to 3.5 MHz will be cut off from the filter and be interpreted as color information, which can be indesirable.
<br />
<br />One thing I still don't understand is how colors are decded. One can filter a 3.5 MHz signal easily and detect whenever or not there is color information, but how can you tell WHICH color it is ? I'm pretty sure amplitude modultion is done for staturation (unused on NES) and phase modultion for the color, but it should be really hard to know the phase of the signal to be able to tell if there is a blue, red or whatever color ?
<br />If the phase change multiple times during less than a full period (what would happen if you try to get a higher resolution than 3.5 MHz with color, what the NES is doing in fact), then the TV can't detect this properly right ?
<br />Even if it could, it would be filtered of by the bandpass filter, so changes in phase could not be detected. Filters does affect the phase of signals.

<br />Correct. Too rapid changes in phase will get confused with luma.

<br />I'm fairly certain PAL uses YUV and NTSC uses YIQ.
<br />It doesn't really matter, it's the same exact colorspace anyway, except YIQ is rotated a little bit from YUV.
