		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm trying to get just enough control over a VRC VI chip to write to the sound registers with a microcontroller. I've read Kevin Horton's paper on the chip many times, but there are still many blanks for me. I'm a EE, and I use projects like this to gain better understanding of the CompE side. 
<br />
<br />How does the chip itself work? The sound register descriptions are very clear, but what is the process for writing data? Say I want to write 0xBE to register 0x9001. Is that just a matter of setting the PRG pins accordingly and triggering a write? What pins can I just ignore completely?
<br />
<br />I am extremely grateful for any help. I am stuck until I make sense of the basic operation.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I haven't given up on this yet. I wired it up to a 1.84MHz oscillator and tied all the non-PRG chip enable pins high. I wired PRG CE and R/W low, and the result is that the pins are giving me output (some are high, some are low, I haven't decoded the actual address/data values yet). Why do I get data on the CHR pins when CHR /CE is tied high?

<br />$9000-2

<br />
<br />all but A13, A12, A1, A0 can be tied. Since A15 is multiplexed with M2, you may need to synchronize your writes to the clock if the registers are flip flops and not latches. If they're latches, you probably can just toggle "/PRG CE" to trigger a write and not mess up the audio.
<br />
<br />Which CHR pins are you talking about? By "CHR /CE" do you mean (PPU /A13)? It doesn't affect the VRC6 at all, the CHR address outputs will change with the address inputs because of the CHR bankswitching register file.

<br />Thanks for the response!
<br />So all the address pins are input only? Sorry if that's a silly question, I just wouldn't want to tie anything to ground that could end up putting out +5V. 
<br />
<br />In my case (not using any ROM), is there a difference between pins with the same name? I'm looking at PRG A14 on pin 6 and PRG A14 on pin 8 as an example. 
<br />
<br />By CHR /CE I mean pin 17. I'm looking at the Kevtris vrcvi.txt file. I don't recall offhand which CHR pins were giving me output, but it sounds like I can ignore them. Sadly I won't be able to touch the circuit for a couple weeks. I'm in the process of moving. 
<br />
<br />Does anyone know if the registers are flip-flops or latches?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Pin 6 is an input from the CPU, pin 8 is an output to the ROM (for bankswitching)
<br />
<br />Pin 17 is an output, so don't tie it to VCC :D
<br />
<br />You should:
<br />Tie pin 6 low, 15 low, 18-19 high, 29-33 high
<br />Control 5, 43, 9-14,34-39
<br />
<br />If the registers do use M2, I think you can trigger a write by just switching between the desired address and an undecoded address (make sure it's held for a complete clock cycle--560ns).
