		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The game looks outstanding and you are an amazing programmer!<br /><br />[edit]<br /><br />Okay I finally got a change to play the demo. Here are my notes and thoughts. <br /><br />- On the title screen only the select button can scroll down the menu options and the buttons B and A do not function. This should most likely be changed. The                                                                             up and down arrows should also scroll through the menu options and the B and A buttons should work the same as the start button for confirming things. <br /><br />- Why not add a charge shot fireball as an additional weapon? A fireball that when charged (B button held down) for a few seconds that is more powerful and can go through several enemies before dissipating.<br /><br />- When you die you go to a continue screen.  Yes, is on the left and No is one the right, however if you press left or right on the D-pad it does nothing. So the left and right buttons probably should be implemented here instead of just using select to choose your option. Also B and A do not confirm your option, this should probably be implemented too. <br /><br />- The first boss that you fight that looks like a stacked green ball cactus. If you beat the boss, but then get killed by the falling into the water the game freezes with a black screen. <br /><br />- I love the intro level screens. Reminds me of the Sonic 1,2 games. <br /><br />- Had no idea that pressing UP + B shoots the special item fireball. Maybe state this somewhere so players know. <br /><br />- Music and graphics are outstanding.

Because the DEMO had some constraints due to the NESdev competition, levels were quite short. Therefore they should be longer in the final version of the game.&quot;
