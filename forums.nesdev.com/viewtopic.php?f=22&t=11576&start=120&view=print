Yes, that is indeed #6; good find! <br /><br />The infinite 1-UP trick is actually not present in the beta build there, since that brick is needed to accomplish it in that part. I truly wonder why it was added to the final to begin with? Big Mario/Luigi can easily break it and little Mario/Luigi can just jump it. I truly believe it was added for that purpose of getting more lives. <br /><br />Proof of this can be seen as Nintendo themselves mention it on page 84 of the official SMB2J guide. (They make mention of how to accomplish this as well as in other locations; the others being the first part of 1-1 at the beginning of the level with the Red Koopa, 2-1 at the beginning by stomping a Koopa repeatedly on the stairs, the beginning of 2-3 using the Koopa before the fish bridge, 6-1 using the Buzzy Beetle at the beginning of the level and 7-1, 7-2, 8-2 and A-1. Though these last four are just mentioned in the guide but don't state how to perform them.)  --ShaneM, the Master of ASM

You'll see the same clip of the beginning of C-1 except for: 1) It seems to take place at day, with a Snowy terrain (the All-Stars version has this level as a Snowy Night one). 2) The level is different with arrangement of blocks and slightly different spacing. 3) <span style="text-decoration: underline"><em><strong>The level is assigned as 5-1 rather than C-1</strong></em></span>. Does this imply that 5-1 was changed at last minute and the original 5-1 was moved to C-1? In intrigues me whether what's now known as 5-1 may have been C-1 at the time and swapped before release or if the current 5-1 didn't exist at the time. 4) As usual, the beta ground tiles are also used. <br /><br />EDIT: The pipes in the beta screenshot replaces the vertical blocks used in the final level with bricks.<br /></div><br /><br />So from this post on page 8 of this thread, I actually found a game guide on Ebay from a Japanese seller which uses this exact same screenshot, but in color! My assumptions were all dead on.

Some things to note:<br /><br />1) It replaces the mushroom used on the final Game Over menu with a big white circle. Not sure if this is just a placeholder or not, but the final uses the mini mushrooms used on various platforms.<br /><br />2) It is clear from reading the manual that the mushroom from the title screen menu was originally going to be used.<br /><br /><img src="http://i1302.photobucket.com/albums/ag140/Shane_Mohammed/IMG_0033_zps76e3d0e0.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Here is a new build of both SMB1 and SMB2J. It corrects A-3 of SMB2J as well as B-4's Warp area. In addition, I've further fixed wind collisions on both builds. Previously, the player could still go through springs, an oversight on my part. That's now fixed. I've also improved sunset and snow palettes since the last time. Patch these to an SMB2J ROM with a crc16 of BA55.  --ShaneM, the Master of ASM<br /><br /><img src="http://i1302.photobucket.com/albums/ag140/Shane_Mohammed/SuperMarioBros2-TheLostLevelswithSRAMJapan-Copy_003_zpsb287d939.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i1302.photobucket.com/albums/ag140/Shane_Mohammed/SuperMarioBros1amp2SRAMPlusJapan_024_zps4e1e8387.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i1302.photobucket.com/albums/ag140/Shane_Mohammed/SuperMarioBros2-TheLostLevelswithSRAMJapan_013_zpsc9e3f82e.png" alt="Image" />

I had to optimize code to earn around 20 free bytes to pull this off, but I did it! Honestly, I didn't do it earlier because space was so tight and I optimized all I could (...so I thought). Will be ready soon. I had to basically renumber all BG IDs to make room for the lower stems.  <br /><br />I've also added some more surprises. The wait will well be worth it; trust me.  --ShaneM, the Master of ASM<br /><br />EDIT: Who would like to see eyes on the mushroom platforms?

I recently gave Podoboo (aka Lava Bubble in later games) eyes. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Thanks for your input, though. I sorta added eyes to it already. Here's a pic with it so that you all can judge if it should stay or not. Also, a pic of Podoboo with eyes, something that has stuck with the franchise since Super Mario World.

I've recreated the SMAS atmosphere of an autumn level with Bullet Bills on 8-2, something not previously possible with the original setup. Only mushroom platforms stages (cloud platforms in SMB2J) could have orange backgrounds and changing with certain level features like tall trees or cannons was not previously possible. I've fixed this and upgraded 8-2. I've hardcoded it so this is only possible with 8-2. Here and some pics.

Now what I've done is put both games on the single game file; SMB1 is on Side A and SMB2J is on Side B. If you need any help figuring out how to swap disk sides within your emulator, just ask. Here are the changes from the last build:<br /><br />1) Attributed Fire Flower to have eyes according to the SNES SMAS remake.<br /><br />2) Fixed various end of level stages on SMB1 where the forts/castles at the end were too far from the Flagpole and caused cutoff at the end (such as 6-1 and 8-3) if the player jumped over the flag (since I ripped the scroll stops from ANNSMB, this needed to be fixed).<br /><br />3) Customized my SMB1's Hard Mode to match my SMB2J one (on Worlds A-D) where the Firebars all move faster.<br /><br />4) Fixed 4-3 on SMB1's Hard Mode where the player couldn't previously attain 5000 pts. due to the fact that platforms are shorter in my version on Hard Mode (the original never suffered that issue since its hard mode isn't as advanced as mine). I basically did minor swapping in PRG ROM to accomplish this.<br /><br />Patch it to an SMB2J <em>headerless</em> ROM with a CRC16 of BA55<br /><br />Enjoy v1.1.  --ShaneM, the Master of ASM

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Someone has emailed me asking about how Xdelta is supposed to be patched. The executable tool that I recommend is <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/" class="postlink">deltapatcher</a>. I've used this tool to create my Xdelta patch; it can also be used to patch existing Xdelta patches, too.<br /><br />How to switch disk sides on Nestopia (for the purpose of playing the fixed version of SMB2J on Side B): To switch disk sides, go to <strong><em>Machine</em></strong>, <strong><em>External</em></strong>, <strong><em>Disk System</em></strong>, <strong><em>Insert</em></strong>, then select <strong><em>Disk 1 Side B</em></strong>. Now, what you want to do is go to <strong><em>Machine</em></strong>, <strong><em>Reset</em></strong>, <strong><em>Hard</em></strong>. <em>The same can be applied for playing SMB1 on Side A afterwards</em>.<br /><br />I'll be releasing a full package release of this game and a special build of Nestopia, soon. So newbies will have (almost) everything they need, including a translated, colored game manual I wrote and a guide to Nestopia and much more.<br /><br />Hash checksums of the true FDS bios image (8kb):<br /><br />Filename: [BIOS] Nintendo Famicom Disk System.bin<br /><br />CRC16: CD1E<br />CRC32: 5E607DCF<br />SHA1 (non-base32): 57FE1BDEE955BB48D357E463CCBF129496930B62<br /><br />My checksum utility for checking a variety of checksums is called <a href="http://compressme.net/" class="postlink">CHK Checksum Utility</a>.  --ShaneM, the Master of ASM
