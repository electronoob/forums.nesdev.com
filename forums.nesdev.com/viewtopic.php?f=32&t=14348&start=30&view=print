I'm biased towards it (since I'm not sure if I'll make it in time with my game) but I still think this is beneficial to the competition.</div><br /><br />To be quite honest, aside from Wrecking Balls there isn't any late project coming from Nintendo Age and pushing the deadline back to another month might not be enough to motivate new entries from people unaware of the Nesdev thread... but it's not a bad idea if there's enough discrepancy in the number of submissions vs. number of project threads.

If it'll help more people get things out, or at least feel like it's worth picking up an otherwise sidelined project, I suppose an extension is for the best.

Sure, the NA thread was neglected, but even those people who said they didn't know about it were actively posting in threads on NA that mentioned they were making their games for the competition.<br /><br />I'm pretty laid back and flexible, but I don't know if it would be fair to those who already submitted their projects.  I'd like to hear what other people think.  Also, since we are going to make this a yearly thing, the contest will essentially be starting up again right away once we get all the info sorted from this(last?) years competition.  Picking a consistent deadline will be important so there are no surprises in the future.  We might also be entertaining the &quot;app&quot; idea from 2014 in the future, since there have been a handful of entries that don't really qualify as games and therefore will have a difficult time fitting into the current judging categories.

Normally, i'd say 'no' out of principle. Also, my part in the project recently published as a progress thread is about done and i'm happy with what i've contributed, regardless if the project makes the deadline or not. But for reasons posted in that threads' OP, i voted like i did. You cannot plan for unexpected health issues that are bad enough to set you back, so i think of it as kind of a force majeur case.   <br /><br />I think it's fair enough from a competition standpoint. The ones who've gotten their projects to a presentable state in good time then have time to polish and tweak at their leisure, possibly making their entries more stronger candidates. Some contributors might not want to alter their entries any more though, so that might be a point. On NA, i don't know nearly enough about the forums or the compos' relation to it, there's nothing for me to say on that matter. <br /><br />I do see the point of having a regular date in the future, though. Like the last sunday in month x or something.

Like the last sunday in month x or something.</div><br />The involvement of Nintendoage is essentially because they are the only other english website that is involved in homebrew development. Also many people there do not wander over to the NESDev forums, and Dain was willing to host the website at no cost.  It was a bit of an effort to bring the communities together.<br /><br />I thought Jan 31st was a good date since people are usually really busy with holiday prep/finals in December.  The only alternative I could think of is some time earlier in the year, but given the date of the announcement that wouldn't leave a whole lot of development time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If we do extend I suggest we pick a date that we plan to stick to year in year out.  No need to worry about future issues of people not knowing about an upcoming compo and deadline if they can count on the deadline coming the same time each year.  That was kind of the original point, pick a date on the calendar to wrap up the compo each year.  Then we stick to it so people can count on us holding another compo the following year.  To some degree I feel the creditably of the compo degrades slightly if we decide to change the deadline when it's less than a week away.  But perhaps that's not something to be concerned about.  These are just my thoughts, I don't feel strongly enough to be disappointed/happy one way or the other.

So it's hard to decide what to do exactly based on the results of the poll alone.  Based on this and the fact the poll itself doesn't have a deadline, the presumption is the poll is advisory.<br /><br />We're less than a week away now so each day that passes, and we leave this question up in the air the bigger mess it becomes.

I'd like to suggest the following outline to get things going:<br /><br />-someone or some few who already has compo-related community confidence (in the form of managing the compo bugdet, publication, etc) form an interim board. The fewer, the more efficient. <br />-that board Instates a 24 hour respite starting asap to let community members around the globe/clock figure these questions out and speak their mind in a designated thread. When the respite has ended, it has ended. <br />-Findings before the respite has ended is taken as advice for the interim board who publish a decision on terms. <br /><br />It's not perfectly democratically secure, but it's something. The formality of it helps the process be clear and time-exact.

The goal is to have an annual compo that can be relied upon to end Jan 31st each year.  If you've missed out on last year's compo, you're just in time for this year's.  There will be ample time for tweaks and polishing of entries prior to cartridge production.  Late entries are still welcome and available for inclusion on the cartridge along with any other desired work that is created outside of the compo.
