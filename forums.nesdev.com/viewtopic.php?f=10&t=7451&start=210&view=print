<br />
<br />I have to agree that any scrolling is kinda tough for absolute beginners (people who are new to the NES as well as game programming in general). If you have never programmed a game/engine for any platform before, it would be a good idea to practice with something simpler on the NES before messing with scrolling.

<br />I can definitely confirm this. At first it seems weird, you'd think it would be 2 times more complex to implement horizontal and vertical, but unfortunately no.
<br />
<br />Also vertical scrolling is harder because of the incomplete attribute row at the end of each NES nametable.

Making sure that both types of scrolling play nice with each other is not such a trivial thing. It's obviously not impossible either, it's just something you have to put a lot of thought into.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also vertical scrolling is harder because of the incomplete attribute row at the end of each NES nametable.</div>
<br />That and because 30 (the number of tiles in a name table column) is not a power of 2. Attributes are definitely the worst part, though.

I think I can do this scrolling... my sister helped me to find <a href="http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&amp;threadid=36958" class="postlink">this Nerdy Nights scrolling article</a>.  And it has made some sense so far... I've made it to the drawing new columns part.  Will read this again after supper.

<br />I disagree. As long as you use 16-bit coordinates for everything (meaning that all objects are inside a "room" larger than 256x256) it shouldn't be much different from single screen games.
<br />
<br />The only real difference is that you can't directly use the objects' coordinates for their sprites, instead you have to subtract the camera's coordinates from them in order to find the coordinates of the sprites on the screen.
<br />
<br />Seriously, scrolling in one axis only is dead simple, I just don't recommend it to newbies because sometimes it's hard for them to grasp the concept of the progressive name table updates (because all tutorials just dump the whole screen to VRAM at once and they don't really know how to do it any other way).

<br />Agreed. Even if the scrolling itself isn't such a big challenge, typical platformers make use of many other concepts that are not trivial for new programmers.

<br />I see. Well, in scrolling games you can use the same type of progressive updates you use for the name tables with the collision data, it's basically the same principle.
<br />
<br />Personally, I prefer to access level data directly from ROM, using compression schemes that allow random access.
<br />
<br />Let me try to classify all the important parts of a scrolling game, the ones that might differ from single-screen games.
<br />
<br />First there's the scrolling engine itself, which handles the rendering of the background:
<br />
<br />- A "camera" that hovers over the level and decides when it's necessary to draw new rows/columns;
<br />- A method to extract the required rows/columns of tiles and attributes from the level map;
<br />- A method to calculate the target address for the tiles/attributes in VRAM and a procedure to write them there during VBlank;
<br />
<br />Then there's the game logic:
<br />
<br />- Management of object/enemy (re)spawning based on a sorted list of entities;
<br />- Collisions between objects, which can be done by directly comparing their coordinates (coordinates must have a number of bits compatible with the dimensions of the largest level);
<br />- Collisions between objects and the background, which require access to the level's collision data (can be progressively decompressed or accessed directly from ROM);
<br />
<br />And finally there's the sprites:
<br />
<br />- Some objects are positioned with absolute coordinates, such as the HUD or anything else that's part of the screen rather than the level;
<br />- Level objects/enemies must have their screen coordinates calculated by subtracting the camera's position from their own;

<br />Trust me, even if you're not scrolling, use 16-bits by all means !
<br />
<br />I had to rewrite everything to convert from 8-bits to 16-bits because I wasn't able to handle sweet movement, and couldn't handle overflows properly.
<br />
<br />I like to use the low 4-bits for sub-pixel movement, the mid 8-bits for pixels and the high 4-bits for screens. I only use screen 0, 1 and -1 (1 and -1 are overflow) in my game but you could go up to 16 screens in both directions with this system.
<br />
<br />About object spawning I've never actually tried this but if I were to do it, I'd just do it so that the game engine computes the distance between the edge of the screen and the object, and if too high just don't call that object's AI routine, so that it freezes. It makes sense to me and it will automatically work again if the player enters that area again. I don't know why so many games does terrible things at enemies respawning (Ninja Gaiden, Mega Man, ....)
<br />
<br />And when I say "computes the distance", I of course not mean the true pythagorian distance, but just use the min of X and Y distance.

<br />Depending on the total number of objects, even just checking how far they are from the camera could be too slow. With 200 or so objects/enemies in a level you would spend several (like, around 50 I'm guessing) scanlines just comparing coordinates.
