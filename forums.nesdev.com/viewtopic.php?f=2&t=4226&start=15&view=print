<br />That would look much better, but he said he doesn't want to break the updating process into smaller bits that will fit inside VBlank, so he has to blank the entire screen. Unless you meant he should fade the entire screen for a little while, which would actually look better than a white flash.

I'm just remembering how annoying it is in DKC when you have the spotlight parrot and every time you turn, the screen flashes as the light shines at you. x_x It's just a stupid little nitpicky problem that only happens in that area, but it's still a little aggrivating. :S

<br />It might have been during the NES's commercial era. Right now, it's almost a wash. <a href="http://retrousb.com/index.php?categoryID=85" class="postlink">RetroZone lists</a> 128 KiB UV EPROMs for $2.50 each, compared to a RAM for $2.50 and a 256 KiB UV EPROM for $3.00. And I'd imagine that prices are a lot cheaper in production quantities.

I wouldn't worry about that. I think you've put together a very nice game. So I take it you're using something like UxROM?

<br />
<br />Awesome game btw, are you going to sell it through bunnyboy/retrousb? I'd buy it.
<br />Are you going to do the other 2 classic columns songs (atropos and lachesis), or the original (not-columns-3) version of clotho?

<br />I also think the white flash would look better as a black blank screen instead.  Like suggested before, it would look even nicer if it faded to black, then the screen was blanked, tiles replaced, then faded back in.

<br />
<br />The video is only a demo, so I'm probably not going to re-upload it.  If I feel like sharing a score video sometime, I may do that.
<br />
<br />The game will be in cart form, yes.  The Sega music is not going to be selectable in the final game as it's copyrighted.  I didn't remove the song from the music data, however, so it's still playable in NSF form.
<br />
<br />And regarding the whole miniscule white flash issue...  I'm just not going to change it.  Especially not at this point. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
