<br />Well, there's one case when local labels are better than +/-, which is when you need to reference a label both before and after the place where it is. With local labels you can do this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;jmp .MyLabel<br /><br />.MyLabel:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;beq .MyLabel</div><br />But since you can't interleave local labels with + and -, you end up giving up on them and doing this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;jmp +MyLabel<br /><br />+MyLabel:<br />-MyLabel:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;beq -MyLabel</div>
<br />Which looks kinda stupid. This is basically the only reason I would like to be able to interleave both types of labels.

INCBIN accepts 3 arguments, a filename, and optionally, a source address and length.  The filename is not quoted.  But when you use a filename, source address, and length, it treats the first comma as part of the filename, unless you add an extra space before the comma.<br />And you can't use INCBIN as part of a macro.  Boo!</div>
<br />Putting the filename in quotes solves your first problem.  I played around with the macro thing and I think I see what you mean.

<br />Yeah, they must be hardcore masochist that enjoy the pain!... or maybe not <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> Hope somebody find it useful actually. I didn't have time to test but the fix was quite simple actually. It seems stable enough. I would need a big project to test it against to make sure it didn't break anything.
<br />
<br />@Loopy
<br />If it's already on your to-do list then I guess I should wait.  I just felt like helping and doing some "quick fix"  when the scope is not too wide for business code and similar to the one I just did, it still something I can do once in a while.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I checked my NESASM code (two actual games), and longest label was 24 chars, unique enough far before it. Masochism is using labels that longer than 32 chars and first 32 chars are the same. If someone has labels that long and uniform, he needs better assembler for sure, with local labels and modules (i.e. local labels accessible through module and non-local label name, module.subroutine.internallabel).

<br />I have to agree with this one.
<br />Yet using NESASM is also kind of masochist, so much this compiler is outdated when there is other maintained compilers available. Because it says "NES" in the name doesn't mean it's THE way to compile NES program (which some people seems to be thinking).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For me it is 'if it ain't broken, don't fix' case. I used NESASM to make quick tests initially, just because I found it first, and it provided fast start (no need to write header). Then I just continued to use it and made few larger projects having no real problems with it at all. If there would be some actual problem in process, I'd just moved to other assembler, but as this takes some time to adapt source, no problems and no profit from using other assembler (no features needed for a project that could save time), why waste time changing horses? After first large project there was other reason to not move - codebase that was made and could be reused.
<br />
<br />When it became really necessary to move to other assembler (Alter Ego), I moved easily, although it took some effort to move part of codebase (i.e. FamiTone, code conversion was done with a custom tool).

<br />Hahahaha Nice suggestion!
<br />
<br />But really, do people actually think it's hard to build the iNES header with .db statements? It's just a few bitshifts harder than what NESASM offers...
