When you move diagonally, the column and the row that need to be updated overlap at the corner of the screen, so if you do things in the wrong order, you may corrupt that corner.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">No attribute tables yet.</div><br />I guess you were a bit too optimistic with that 99% figure then... attributes are easily the worst part of an 8-way scroller, specially if the map is built with 256x256-pixel blocks instead of 256x240 ones. I think you mentioned using 256x240, so your case is not so bad, but you still have to split and combine attribute bytes vertically when updating rows, which's kind of annoying.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Edit, I'm using 4 screen mode, btw.</div><br />Oh, so you may not need to do any serious attribute juggling after all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Techniques for blanking the first 8 or 16 lines (needed if you do not want any sprite pop-up !) can range from disabling BG by $2001 and having 8 high priority sprites there, to disable rendering completely, or leave everything enabled but use blank CHR-ROM pages for everything.</div><br />Yeah, that's right. Jurassic Park uses the blank (actually black) patterns approach. This is better because it doesn't waste any sprites, but the other method is not so bad IMO.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also I forgot to mention that IF you're using 8x8 sprites, you could also use horizontal mirroring, and hide the left and right 8 pxiels (requires 30 sprites !!) and hide only the top 8 lines.

That's still pretty wasteful though, because not only you have to waste 15 sprites (compared to only 9 with the other approach), but you also effectively reduce the number of sprites per scanline to 7, as if 8 wasn't already bad enough.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">hardware wise it makes a lot of sense to solve the problem this way</div><br />That was my conclusion. No need to be masochistic about something just so you can be 100% authentic to some specific time period, if you can just go with a very simple solution that has no real drawbacks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Exactly. There are two advantages in using a sprite overflow instead of disabling rendering completely:<br /><br />1- By keeping rendering on, you avoid the alternate dot crawl pattern in NTSC, which can look weird;<br /><br />2- You can use the sprite overflow flag to sync up with the start of the frame, eliminating the need for a constant-timed NMI handler, which is all but trivial to code.

And if you use it on the first 8 scanlines there should be no risk for unexpected behaviour.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If you want to detect the end of vblank, you have to poll $2002 in the vblank handler, after all PPU operations are done, waiting for the overflow flag to be *cleared*.<br /><br />All raster effects timed from the start of the frame should be done in the NMI handler, because you want them to happen every frame, even if the game logic lags, otherwise the image will glitch every time the game slows down.</div><br />I see, one disadvantage of this is that you are potentially loosing some time for your logic to run in waiting for the flag I guess.

I am buffering nametable writes every frame, lots of them. 130 scanlines of filling buffers, and there's no music.<br /><br />EDIT - and right up against the end of v-blank every frame, like 10-20 instructions before the pre-render scanline. So...basically, no PPU updates or palette changes of any kind, unless I shut off my own PPU updates for a frame.
