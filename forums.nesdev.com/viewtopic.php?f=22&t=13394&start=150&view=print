Down, accesses the black level screen with all the darkest colors compared to black talked about earlier,<br />2. Up, go to a color bleed screen<br />3. Press A while on full red or full white to cycle Green and Blue (or some other simple input scheme that doesn't lose the instant, D-right, to cycle red/white)<br />4. Press A while on grid to bring up overscan test with default to 1 pixel L/R, 7 pixels top bottom. Also original over-scan screen would be nice to have the pixels outside of the grey box all be white rather than everything outside of 0 0 0 0 box is also same grey, because then it's hard to tell your edge with 0 or less.<br />5. Press A while on black level to bring up a an eye candy screen. Something like a half/half of these two screens below would be awesome and/or a mashup of the NES characters people are most familiar with like: Belmont, Mario(s), Megman, Samus, Link, Little Mac, ect.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://images.craigslist.org/00w0w_dk7dOPVVGQs_600x450.jpg">https://images.craigslist.org/00w0w_dk7 ... 00x450.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_6iGXldyYAXi_600x450.jpg">https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_6iG ... 00x450.jpg</a><!-- m --><br />6. Press B while black level to cycle a focus test screen, just white dots on black and black dots on white; or sub dots for text.<br /><br /><br />Ways to make the color bleed screen better:<br />The horizontal stripes are great now, but White is the most important, would want to check white bleed on ALL parts of the screen. Would be nice to have 4-6 horizontal stripes that extend ALL the way to left/right sides, and repeat that strip of white strips with section of black in between. Could also allow pressing again/holding D-up to scroll the stripes up. The reason not making it half white stripe half black stripe on full screen is that it puts too much load out at once and is harder to get an accurate bleed test. Input-A could cycle the colors Red, Green Blue could be nice to double check which colors are bleeding more. Input-B could switch to vertical or checker but not important.

It wouldn't be in the same boat. I wonder if something of a similar vien could be used though, like the bricks with leafs and text from CVIII name select screen with some other colorful pixel art thrown in. Are there just free assists of good colorful pixel part that could be imported?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />These compression improvements were in part to help keep this included as a &quot;toy&quot; in the <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=17481&amp;hilit=action" class="postlink">full Action 53 collection</a>. The more I keep the size down, the more other stuff the builder can squeeze into the unused area, and the more likely 240p Test Suite will meet the <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=220995#p220995" class="postlink">&quot;Must fit&quot; criterion</a>. Compression improvements would also be appreciated if someone else attempts a port to the Famicom Disk System with FDSStick, as requested in a private message about a year ago, as they would help more tests' data fit in the 32 KiB RAM of the system card without loading breaks.<br /><br />In an effort to hit an arbitrary 40960 byte (40 KiB) milestone, I recently took a survey of size in bytes of each test on both NES and Game Boy. The Overscan and Manual lag test were identified as two places where the size of the NES version greatly exceeds the size of the GB version. Other places were justified, largely because of the greater perimeter and area of the NES picture, but these two deserve special consideration.<br /><br />Overscan on NES spends about half of its ROM space (about 1K of 2K) on calculating 32x4- and 4x30-cell tilemap update packets for the side borders. I could probably reduce this by drawing the side borders partially with sprites, the way I did with GB's right border. (It draws the left and top borders with scrolling, the bottom border with the scanline counter, and the right border with a combination of sprites and the window.)<br /><br />Manual lag test on NES displays a string &quot;Marvelous&quot;, &quot;Perfect&quot;, &quot;Great&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Boo&quot;, or &quot;Miss&quot; depending on how far the press was from 0 lag, with the appropriate color from <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em>. Artemio's original versions on Genesis and Super NES do not, nor does my Game Boy port. Two years ago, <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=176165#p176165" class="postlink">rainwarrior suggested</a> that this <em>DDR</em> theming could trigger reflexes in users to anticipate the press, which could bias the result. Cutting this experimental feature should reduce ROM size.<br /><br />I could shoot for 40K, or I could instead target 48K and add more features:<br /><br /><ul><li>SpiderWaffle has <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=213384#p213384" class="postlink">requested</a> the thin, aspect-ratio-adjusted grid of Linearity by itself, with no circles. In 0.17 and earlier, this wasn't possible, as the versions with and without grid used different nametables, and I had to put the grid-only version in a separate ROM. But now with the recent improvement to Linearity's compression, they use the same nametable, and I can use the second nametable to make a third version with just the grid.</li><li>SpiderWaffle has <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=213396#p213396" class="postlink">requested</a> a PLUGE with vertical bars of all $0x colors.</li><li>Expand IRE to Motion blur as on GB</li></ul>
