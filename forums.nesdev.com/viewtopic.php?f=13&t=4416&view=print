<br />Spammers conveniently show their intentions through www links.  They also have a pattern of waiting some time after joining before posting their rubbish.  A daily sweep through this list, killing obvious spammers would probably help.

<br />Do not post anything as your personal website until 7 days after you register. If you do, you will be banned.
<br />
<br />Would this be hard to stick in? If not, why not do it? This will give you the opportunity to look a the "New Members" list, and see who has a link to a website. If they do, cut them out. Even if not all spammers have a link, it still would heavily reduce the number here.

Maybe you will have more patience than I did at the time though.

But 99.99% of the accounts I was deleting back then were inactive anyways, and couldn't post.  They were registering like 10 accounts per day.
<br />
<br />Then I patched in a simple security question that someone had suggested, that cut off the flow of spammers for a while, but obviously the asshole spambots are getting smarter now.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" />
<br />
<br />If they can get past a simple (but customized) question, it's hard telling what other measures they can bypass also..
