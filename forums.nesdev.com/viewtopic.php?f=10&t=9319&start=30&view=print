I just checked, and even the japanese versions don't.<br /><br />EDIT: Out of curiosity I went and checked Somari, that crapy chinese Sonic 1 port: it does read both bits, in a very inefficient way though (it uses the stack to keep track of the regular controller, a ZP variable for the expansion port controller, and ORs them together in the end).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you have a non-AV Famicom and your controller has a problem it is not as though you cannot replace or repair them. While it's harder than just plugging in a new controller, anyone interested in the hobby of playing Famicom games in the current time frame shouldn't be too surprised if they need to open their machine up to repair something. Or to have someone else do it. It's the reality of still playing with these very old machines. Replacing a controller probably is easy though maybe not cheap.

Say there's an old tv remote control laying around that wasn't used very much in  the past...  and now it just sits  unused on the coffee table.   So I could remove the contact pads from my NintendoES controller and replace them with some of the unused contact pads from the remote control?  Is quality of pads an issue to worry about?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, there are two ways how the rubber pads 'broke'. The first is the rubber wears out in the area where it bends when you press the pad, it just tears apart, and that reduces 'bouncing' quality of the button, or whatever you would call it, down to zero. The second is that the conducting part of the rubber wears out, its resistance raises and it requires more and more force to make the controller register the button press.<br /><br />The first can't be really fixed without replacing the worn part. The problem with replacing the rubber is that rubbers from other devices has different shape, so they aren't hold in place. That's why old rubber with removed contact pads can help, it can serve as a holder.<br /><br />the second can be sort of fixed in a few ways without replacing the rubber, although it may not last for long - put some graphite on the conductive part, or use a thin sandpaper or a nailfile to remove thin surface layer.
