		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I've been experimenting with original hardware recordings of my NSF covers, and I've been wondering...<br /><br />Is it feasible to either:<br /><br />a) Create a custom cartridge with FDS audio implemented?<br /><br />or<br /><br />b) Create a custom disk to play NSFs from on an FDS?<br /><br />I would <em>really</em> like to use authentic expansion chips in these recordings rather than rely on emulation. I think I might avoid FDS if I can't get someone to do accurate recordings in the near future.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Totally doable. Just somewhat obnoxious, and NSF's bankswitching style is particularly obtuse with the FDS (which provides only 32KiB flat RAM from $6000-$DFFF and BIOS from $E000-$FFFF).<br /><br />There's a person in Japan who's explicitly made hardware players for NSFs: the TNS-HFC4 and HFX4 are overkill, but they do explicitly support the FDS base (while the TNS-HFC3 is claimed not to).<br /><br />Making an FDS image out of an unbanked NSF shouldn't be too awful: you'd need to provide it with up to 32 KiB of PRG to upload to RAM, and deal with the bootloader. A little more involved than vegaplay, but not tremendously.

In this situation the audio mix level of the FDS is arbitrary, but at least all the sound producers are the real thing.

There's a a bit of variation from NES to NES, Famicom to Famicom of how the two 2A03 audio pins get mixed, then for expansion audio carts there is also variation from cart to cart.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, I believe the TNS-HFC carts have a volume control of some kind; from what I understand they don't send the audio back to the Famicom, but instead have an output jack on the board. I've never seen one firsthand though, and they don't ship outside of Japan.<br /><br />I put a volume control on my NES audio mod, myself. It's very handy when trying to balance the expansion carts.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The hum isn't from the jack, it's coming from the NES/Famicom and is part of the 2A03's audio signal. Placing a jack on the Famicom cartridge won't help with this.<br /><br />You could disconnecting the 2A03 audio and record the expansion only. It would get rid of the hum from the 2A03 source, but obviously you don't get the 2A03 sound either. It depends where you have use for the expansion sound; if you're hoping for an authentic hardware recording you're going to need a 2A03 (with authentic hum) in there.<br /><br />I have heard that making your NSF player display the forbidden beyond-black colour in the background can reduce the hum (since it is largely crosstalk from the PPU signal).
