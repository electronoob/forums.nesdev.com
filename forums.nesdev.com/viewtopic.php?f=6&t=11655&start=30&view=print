		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Would you be willing to send me your nsf, or a stripped-down version of it that continues to give you trouble with DPCM? That'd be the most efficient way for me to look into the problem. I've only tested it with a couple of short drum samples---perhaps there are bugs with longer samples, or a bug in the exporter. <br /><br />Since you're using CA65, you can use .align 64. I think you will need to add that above your dpcm samples (they are automatically aligned against one another, but the very beginning of them needs to be aligned manually) as well as aligning the segment itself within your config file (unless you know for sure the samples are already at the very beginning of the segment. which would already be a 64 byte boundary). Try that first, and if that doesn't work please pm me and I'll work with you further on this. Thanks for the bug report!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You'll just have to ensure somehow that your DPCM samples always reside in $C000 or later. That means they have to be in the fixed bank in many mappers---or, you could use a mapper which allows swapping out of both $8000 and $C000 so that you can have more space available. The APU is hard-wired to only be able to read DPCM samples from $C000 on.<br /><br />*edit* No matter what configuration you use, you'll have to keep your DPCM samples at the same location (duplicated) in all banks swapped into $C000 (for configs that don't have a fixed bank at $C000). The reason is as you require other code/data in other banks, the DPCM hardware may still be playing (concurrently with your code that might suddenly need another bank)<br /><br />Simplest thing by far would just be to have a fixed bank at $C000, with a swappable bank/banks at $8000. Keep your DPCM samples at $C000. Then, keep ggsound in the fixed bank at $C000 as well. If you wish, it's not too hard to wrap ggsound in bankswitching to keep ggsound and music data in a swappable bank at $8000, I do this in my games. DPCM samples however as explained must remain at $C000. (really, anywhere at or after $C000, as long as you .align 64 right before including the samples)

I'd  be interested to learn if it is possible to have more. I am aware of course one could manually play longer samples (while pausing other action), but for the purposes of using the hardware to concurrently play a sample while your code continues to run, I believe that is the limitation.<br /><br />Glad you found those tutorials, they are looking to be some of the best out there for helping new folks into the scene, since asm is a dealbreaker for many.

However, the APU can generate an IRQ when the sample ends, so that can be used to start a new sample more or less immediately after another. With PRG banking you're then only limited by amount of available PRG-ROM, basically.

But on a mapper that bankswitches $C000-$DFFF, such as MMC3, FME-7, several VRCs, or even the repurposed UNROM board used for <em>Crazy Climber</em>, you can switch a bunch of audio. <em>Klax</em>, for instance, does this.
