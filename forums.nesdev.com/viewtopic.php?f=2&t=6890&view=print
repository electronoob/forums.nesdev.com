<br /> <div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Most emulators allow the program to twiddle PPU registers immediately, while the NES PPU ignores most writes for the first frame after a reset. </div><br /> <div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Writes to the following registers are ignored if earlier than ~29658 CPU clocks after reset: $2000, $2001, $2005, $2006. The other registers work immediately: $2002, $2003, $2004, $2007, $4014. </div>
<br />
<br />Shouldn't it be possible write to the PPU as the very first thing you do as the program starts up, then wait for the PPU to stabilize and read the supposedly illegal written values?
<br />
<br />For instance:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Start:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$20<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2006<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$10<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2006<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$A0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2007<br /><br />waitVBlank1:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda $2002<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bpl waitVBlank1<br />waitVBlank2:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda $2002<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bpl waitVBlank2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$20<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2006<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$10<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2006<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda $2007<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda $2007<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;cmp #$A0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;beq Detected.Emulator</div>
<br />
<br />If the emulator works according to the Wiki, the $A0 value should in fact not be written to $2010 at all, because the PPU ignores the $2006 writes. That would of course mean the above code will detect emulators that allow writing to the PPU immediately, am I correct?
<br />If this is the case, very few emulators seems to disallow writing to the PPU immediately.
<br />
<br />Of course you have to take into account that the PPU might already have been stabilized at the beginning of the program (Reset?).
<br />
<br />Any thoughts/picking?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Detecting emulators and display a message that the emulator might be inaccurate might take some the blame off your game by fanboys where your game doesn't work in their favorite emulator. Not for writing compatible code, but basically just warn the user. Warning the user might also force emulator developers make more accurate emulators.

Soft resets after that, on the other hand, will have writes be ignored on the first frame.
<br />
<br />Better is to detect behavior related to what your game actually uses. For example, if your game (ab)uses APU DMC to make a letterbox or other scroll split effect, test that while your game's copyright screen is being displayed. The one thing this won't detect, however, is people who abuse save states and slowdown to falsify achievements.

<br />Not only that, but also an emulator might as well ignore your first writes like the real hardware would. So false detections are possible in both directions, which basically sucks.
<br />
<br />I've heard a good way to test emulators was to test the open bus behavior when reading for example $4016 - emulators will return $4x, but if you use indirect adressing to read $4016, it will return something else. This might as well be emulated by someone - so it's not a solid way either. In fact there is no solid way, because anything that could deflect "most emulators", an emulator can be upgraded to be more accurate and defeat your detection algorithm. That would be a cat-and-mouse game, as seen with PSP and NDS consoles and flash cards available for them.

<br />If there's a prominent malfunction, I'm sure they'll be tempted to fix it anyway. In fact, it would be better if they used their time to fix the behaviors that cause the actual glitches than the behavior that causes the warning to be displayed.

<br />If it really is simple, in the sense that you are trying to do everything "by the book" (i.e. no forced blanking, no mid-screen PPU changes or any other kind of special effects), you should check your program for bugs. If you are indeed just doing the "bread and butter", there is no reason for current emulators to disagree on the output. If this is happening, even if your program happens to work on hardware as expected it's probably not very stable, and might still fail under certain circumstances.
<br />
<br />What I mean is, don't blame the emulator(s) if you are not relying on obscure aspects that are not well documented.

<br />I've used an NSF from Famitracker using the MMC5 expansion chip and I do some bankswitching, but 4/9 emulators doesn't have the extra sound channels or other sound issues. The main point of the program is the music, and when it's not played correctly I'd like to be able to say "This is not what it's supposed to sound like". The point of the PPU writes was just to detect emulators in general, though. But I don't have any way of testing on the real hardware at the moment, so I suppose I'll let it pass.

<br />I suppose you mean IF i rely on obscure stuff, but that's not my point. My point is that many emulators doesn't aim on being accurate and I'd like to be safe and detect them and tell the user "Safety helmet required, enter on your own risk". Not that it's something I'd die for, though, it'd just be nice to do.

<br />
<br />Or detect Nesticle and outright reject it for games which do ANY kind of raster effects.  Games which just scroll with no effects tend to work fine on Nesticle though, with some exceptions (like Cartoon Workshop).
