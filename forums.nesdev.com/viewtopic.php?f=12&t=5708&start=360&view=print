<br />As I said before, the SNES PowerPak can tend to be picky about the CF card type. My 4GB SanDisk card works fine most of the time. Small ROMs (&lt;4 Mbit) often fail to load, while they do load and play just fine when using a 512 MB card. Strange, but that's how it is.
<br />
<br />In your case though, I'd contact RetroZone support about why the card your PowerPak shipped with doesn't work (provided you're using verified good ROMs and the filesystem isn't corrupted, of course).
<br />
<br />Good luck! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />

<br />My SanDisk cf card arrived today.  Its the same one you pictured, actually.  I was very hopeful, but it simply didn't work.  I couldn't get past the boot screen.  The error message claimed there was on odd amount of space on the card.  I reformatted it several times in two different computers and still had the same result.  I followed the troubleshooting guidelines in the PP manual as well.  It's a shame, but I may have a bad PowerPak.  I have contacted retrousb and they have agreed to allow me to return the item.  Right now I'm just waiting for them to send me their return mailing address.  It's a shame, I really wanted to get this cart working.

<br />Sorry to hear your PowerPak is faulty. At least you've got a reply from the support staff. I hope they'll sort things out for you!
<br />
<br />Concerning the SIMBA firmware: Today I managed to fix the scrolling routine for BG1 and BG2. With this, my hack has reached early alpha state, and long-term testing/tweaking has begun. An official release doesn't seem too far from now! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />

<br />At least you got a reply.  After about 6 months of trying to contact him via his website email, and several other sites, I was never able to get a reply.  I finally just threw it in the trash as it was nothing more than a paperweight.  Dudes a prick.

<br />Thanks for asking! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />At this time, I can't give you a definite release date yet. I'm currently working my way through bunnyboy's code (and heaps of FAT16/32 documentation) in order to have the new filebrowser load and display 52 characters per entry. Didn't think there was a challenge like this lying ahead when I began, whew! But I do think I'm getting there, albeit slowly. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Concerning the actual firmware update, two steps will be required, the first (and easy) of which will be to replace the mapper files on your CF card. The second will involve one of two possible actions:
<br />
<br />1) You screw open your PowerPak and reflash the boot ROM chip (if it is socketed) with a PLCC32 programmer. This is how I'm doing all my testing, btw. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />-- or --
<br />
<br />2) You put the new loader ROM file on your CF card and invoke a self-flashing process. This will likely be the only way to update your PowerPak at all if you have a newer board revision (look inside the CF card slot and check the printing on the PCB, mine says "8/9/09 revD"). According to bunnyboy, self-flashing was never tested (and thus, maybe not even fully implemented). I'll investigate. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />In the meantime, here's a shot of the boot screen cleanup I did today:

<br /><img src="http://www.manuloewe.de/snestuff/powerpak/firmware-200alpha-WIP120723-1.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />This wasn't by far as trivial as it might look (and it doesn't work completely bug-free yet, either). But as long as it doesn't break ROM loading -- which it did until very recently -- there's no reason to be worried. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

<br />Big update today:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://manuloewe.de/snestuff/powerpak/firmware-200alpha-WIP120726-2.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />
<br />The filebrowser now works completely bug-free. As suppressing garbage text at the top and bottom of the screen turned out to be a pain in the neck, I taught myself how to use HDMA and created a "window", which simply masks anything unwanted out. Works like a charm! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> 
<br />
<br />While I was at it, I also added a nice gradient HDMA background color table. Those few lines with the wrong color will hopefully yet be fixed. Meanwhile, have another look at the boot screen:
<br />
