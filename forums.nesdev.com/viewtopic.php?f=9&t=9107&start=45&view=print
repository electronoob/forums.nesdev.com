		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have had an NES PowerPak since it was first out, then purchased a second one for a fund raiser along with a SNES PowerPak. I have never had any issues with it and none with the CF that came with them. I also have a Lexar 2GB CF card from Walmart that works in both and a Chinese knock off SanDisk 1GB my ex brought in a little market stall in China for $10, no issues there either.
<br />
<br />Recently I have noticed more and more people complaining about their PowerPaks not working, no customer service etc.... 
<br />
<br />Its too bad. 
<br />
<br />I think when NESDev moves there should be a sticky at the top that states this is not a complaints department for Retrozone.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think such a sticky would be a bad idea. A lot of people on this forum use retrousb products, and we often help each other find solutions here. Discussing problems we've had with retrousb stuff is also important so we can get a good idea of what kind of product/service/quality they are providing. It's relevant to our common interest. Why shouldn't we complain about it here? This is a good place to talk about it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is it? BunnyBoy replied by saying we are better to use IRC. We can sit on here all day and complain till the cows come home, from what we are seeing BunnyBoy doesn't seem to offer up any help other than &quot;try IRC&quot;. <br /><br />Why are we seeing such an influx of faultyNES?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> I don't know, all of my dealings with Retrozone have been successful.<br /><br />We could have a sticky that offers up some of the advice others have been successful with, ROMs, formatting, header removal programs, CF cards and compatibility etc... but when it comes to hardware issues it always seems to boil down to &quot;send it back&quot; which we are seeing is not a very fruitful endeavour.<br /><br />I just see this as a complain about Retrozone thread and thats not what NESDev is about.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree, this topic should be pinned if anything because people are getting screwed left and right and it should be known retrousb is a danger honestly. Nobody is complaining for no reason, they're complaining because they lost over $100 and got nothing back about it but frustration and a fancy paperweight.<br /><br />And no, there's MANY forms of contact on his website. I recall on NA he said to a user who tried to contact him and then made a post about it and all bunny had to say was &quot;well how many forms of contact did you try?&quot; which is utter garbage. As a business owner he, especially over the web, he should check the email EVERY DAY and that should be the ONLY way you contact him. I dunno why he's so special and can't do such a simple task to offer better service, but whatever the reason it's not good enough.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A lot of companies, such as Go Daddy and Comcast, have a &quot;Live Chat&quot; button that opens a web-based instant message session with an employee. Would it help if retrousb.com were to have a &quot;Live Chat&quot; button that opened up a web-to-IRC gateway? Remind me to mention it to bunnyboy next time I bump into him on #nesdev.
