Awesome, thanks for the permission guys.<br /><br />Just thought I would add, I also can offer a Copy-NES installation service.  Price would be similar to that of the dev cart, however you would supply the NES and CopyNES boards.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4016">R-T-B</a> — Sun Nov 08, 2009 2:02 pm</p><hr />

Yeah it's advertising, but it's far from being spam.  There's no way around hardware costing money, and if it's potentially beneficial to NES developers, then it seems fine to me.<br /><br />Though I can see why it'd be kind of hazy to draw the line, if someone registered entirely to come in here and sell something like a service (cart modding) or commodity (tools, chips), even that was relevant, they'd be seen as an "outsider" and probably met with a high degree of suspicion unless they were reputable and also had unbeatable prices. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><br />But yeah speaking of prices, I think they are a little high, but it's totally within reason (if that makes any sense).  For comparison, for a short time several years ago I was offering built UNROM carts with a FlashROM + case (not cut ones like yours tho) for $22 (CopyNES compatible for writing, or could be socketed).  With a new PCB and all.  Demand was so low (probably since I'm averse to doing "reproductions/bootlegs"), that it was nearly a waste of time if it wasn't so fun and educational to do for myself.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />   I sold 2 or 3 of them.  Not that I advertised it much.  I'm sure by now there's more hardware-averse people that may be interested in a service like this.  Though using socketed EPROMs for development is pretty unfriendly, I'd definitely say to wire them up for flash chips.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">R-T-B wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Hope someone takes me up on this, as I'm actually finding myself enjoying the hardware part more than the software part.

I pretty much dived right into the hardware thing as a newb, after a little coding burnout.  I soon found out that I could combine those 2 things together in new and exciting ways by putting a PIC MCU on an NES cart (Squeedo project), heheh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat Nov 07, 2009 1:19 am</p><hr />

Hmmm... It could be considered advertisement but it's a service to the community in a way (with the recent surge in repro, this service could help).<br /><br />I guess only Memblers, Koitsu and Tepples can decide if it does break the Parodius policy about advertising.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Fri Nov 06, 2009 8:12 pm</p><hr />

This is sort of an ad, but just as much I consider this a community service for newbies.  I'm not in this for a profit but if anyone thinks this violates forum rules please don't hesitate to take it down.<br /><br />I have quite a few dev carts laying around for my own use  I basically don't need anywhere near as many as I have, but find I kind of enjoy making them...  I've gotten to the point where I almost never even burn myself on the NES boards (the PCBs never really got burned, just me. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> )<br /><br />I'd be willing to cook some up for some forum members not so skilled at soldering and have an ample supply of donor carts and/or third party boards plus associated EPROM/EEPROMS and other chips to make them in the following configurations:<br /><br />NROM<br />CNROM<br />UOROM<br />AOROM<br />MMC1 (pretty much whatever you want).<br /><br />Turn around is probably about 1-3 business days (depending on whether I need to make it or have it), and I'd ask for a price of $45 to cover build time/labor, parts, and shipping to most of the world.  I can work with people who are strapped for cash though, just that's my asking price.<br /><br />I can also do special order boards, including MMC5, whatever.  Just understand it will be a special order and I'll probably ask for more (think like $70 for MMC5).  I also might have to refund your money if I simply can't find the parts, but I'll do that promptly in most cases.<br /><br />All boards feature a nicely cut "perfect fit" hole for the ZIF sockets easy access, and for those with board controlled mapping, a toggle switch that toggles between H and V mirroring with labels.  The carts are stripped of labels and will ship to you with nothing minus my own little logo that can easily be removed.  Your free to customize.<br /><br />Hope someone takes me up on this, as I'm actually finding myself enjoying the hardware part more than the software part.  Guess that makes me weird? <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Thanks for reading, PM me if interested.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4016">R-T-B</a> — Fri Nov 06, 2009 7:13 pm</p><hr />
