		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, so I decided to put a 16450 UART into an NES.
<br />
<br />I'm having a bit of trouble getting it to work properly, and was wondering if someone could spot an error in my schematics. I built the thing already, tried initializing the UART and writing to it. So far no go.
<br />
<br />The basis of my design came off the C64, and I was assuming that it shares some similar bus architecture with the NES. Mainly concerning the control bus.
<br />
<br />First off, I'm assuming that M2 is like Phi2 on the C64? Where all address lines are valid on M2 logic high? Also, that PRG R/-W is also similar to that of the C64.
<br />
<br />Here are my schematics, please constructive criticism only, I'm rather frustrated at this point,
<br />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Do you intend to take advantage of the UART's ability to receive while you're doing something else with the NES CPU?
<br />
<br />If you can live with occupying the NES CPU whenever a byte is being sent or received, you can implement a UART in software and use a very simple MAX232 level convertor tied to one of the I/O pins. Memblers posted a schematic a while back and I think still has some of the interface cables he made.
<br />
<br />I've implemented something similar that works well at 5.76 KB/sec. I'd be happy to provide my code and help with getting this working.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was hoping this was going to be easier to implement than writing it in software, and on the up side I would have more CPU cycles to work with.
<br />
<br />However, things aren't quite going as I had hoped.
<br />
<br />I got ahold of a oscilloscope and made sure that the crystal is working at the correct frequency. My address decoder is also working (74HC138) properly. I can only imagine that the problem lies with the Phi2, R/-W lines, converting them to -IOR, -IOW.
<br />
<br />I could try using a 6850 instead, as it was designed for use with the 68XX and 65XX series of chips, and has Phi2 and R/-W inputs.
