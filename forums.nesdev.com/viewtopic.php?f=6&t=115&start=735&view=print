<br />
<br />Yes, thank you for fixing all those. Now a question - do you plan on making other batch 4017 fixes soon? If not I'll just upload updated NSF Pack, if yes I'll wait for a while.
<br />
<br />Also, about that one NSF you added that was missing - it was there all along: Twin Cobra JP - Kyuukyoku Tiger (1989)(CBS, Sony, Taito).nsf
<br />Still, thanks for the effort. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />I felt that I could update NSFs I worked on previously without spending much time on the matter. Overall, I think I was right, but going through a good number of other people's NSFs may end up being an alphabetical process using the NSF_Pack contents.
<br />
<br />There's also the matter of how different emulators make an NSF sound based on what point 80 is written to 4017. FCE based emulators seem pretty tolerant of timing, as does NEZPlug, but to make it right in NotSoFatso, you need to write it only during init, or it ends up sounding like it wasn't set. Mach Rider's track 4 seems to be the easiest way to hear the difference between 4017 writes, so it is something to be aware of for player compatibility issues.

<br />
<br />Can you specify? I mean, sample wavewrites of the NSF before fix and after it? I can't really spot any difference (I'm using NSFPlug though, that may be the cause).

<br />
<br />Check track 4, about 9 seconds in. There should be a quick blip of 2 notes in either player in the unfixed version, and 1 continuous note in the fixed one. This is the most dramatic example that I've found, but other games probably have more minute differences that may go unnoticed due to the problem notes, like Castlevania 2.
<br />
<br />It took some experimenting to get Mach Rider to work, and I've used that as the basis for the fixes I've applied. In NotSo, initing 4017 continuously is the same as not initing it for Mach Rider, but initing once during the NSF Init routine is compatible with the few players I've tried it with, so writing 4017 during NSF init seems to be the standard to follow.
<br />
<br />Hope that explains it.

<br />
<br />Ah, that'd explain it. NSFPlug doesn't support $4017 at all. This, with the already known $4015 bugs would make it kinda worthless. I'm gonna mail the author of the plugin, we'll see if it helps.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I hate that this is the case, but...
<br />I think that I'm at a dead-end with NotSoFatso.
<br />
<br />NotSo, when initing 4017 with 80 continuously, straight out fails to sound accurate. I suspect that those NSFs that do this from code also sound incorrect.
<br />
<br />I'd be willing to start with NotSoFatso fixed2, but I don't have the source code. I can guess that the problem is that with 4017 being inited, some other variable is being set in the emulation that shouldn't be set, or should only be set if the 4017 state is different.
<br />
<br />I'll see if I can't fight with jdc for the source code he used, and try to fix it with what little I know about the emulation process, or at least, try to fix it in the official version, and leave the changes for it on my page.
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />
<br />-
<br />When you write 1 to bit 7 of $4017, the frame counter will be
<br />reset, but the first sound update will occur at the same time.
<br />2nd, 3rd, and 4th update will be done after 7457, 14914, 22371
<br />CPU cycles after the first update respectively, but the 5th
<br />update will be 14914 cycles after the 4th update.  This causes
<br />sound output to last 1.25 times longer than that of bit 7 = 0.
<br />-
<br />
<br />The above is adhered to in NotSo, however, it's not consistent enough when writing to 4017.
<br />
<br />In FCEU*, it seems to act correctly, but I haven't found out why yet.
<br />
<br />For the FCEU code, open Sound.c, and find "V&amp;=0xC0;". That's the 4017 write routine for it.
<br />
<br />In NotsoFatso, it's NSF_Code.cpp, and "case 0x4017:".
<br />
<br />I'd try stuff to fix it, but I don't have the software to compile Notso.(unless, by some chance, it'll compile in the free MS visual C, in which case, I'll get it in a few days for testing stuff)
