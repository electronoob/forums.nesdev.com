<br />Anyway, I adapted blargg's version of putTile with the following changes:
<br />
<br />Remove 'eor' instructions (+6 cycles/character)
<br />  - Replaced eor @temp/rol a with lda @temp/rol a/and #
<br />  - Extra and instruction slowed it down by 2 cycles per row for 3 out of 8 cases.
<br />
<br />Restore OR semantics (+32 cycles/character)
<br />  - Required "Remove 'eor' instructions"
<br />  - Extra 'ora' instruction slowed it down by 4 cycles per row.
<br />
<br />Unflip tile data (+6 cycles/character)
<br />  - Replaced inx/dey with dex/dey
<br />  - Replaced txa with txa/adc #7/tax/adc #1
<br />  - Now x counts down from x+7 to x+0
<br />
<br />Prepare for page alignment reads (+4 cycles/character)
<br />  - Required "Unflip tile data"
<br />  - Replaced txa/adc #7/tax/adc #1 with stx @temp/txa/adc #7/tax/ldx @temp
<br />
<br />Page align reads (-7 cycles/character)
<br />  - Required "Unflip tile data"
<br />  - Replaced adc #7 with ora #%111
<br />  - Removed -1, -2, -3, etc. from lineImgBuf accesses
<br />  - Reclaim 1 cycle per row from garbage reads in 7 out of 8 cases
<br />
<br />Skip spaces
<br />  - In vwfPuts, skip calling putTile for character #32
<br />
<br />Net effect: +41 cycles/character, or roughly +2 frames.  I countered that slowdown by modifying vwfPuts to skip drawing character 32 (space). And now for the same text, I get 23 frames in Nintendulator, compared to 31 frames for 0.02.

Obviously, a straight 8-bit-per-character encoding is right out, as gzip compresses text at 3:1. But plain old Lempel-Ziv compression doesn't work well because there isn't much RAM inside an NES to hold the ring buffer (for LZ77) or dynamic dictionary (for LZ78). Does anybody know what kind of compression was used for answers and questions in Rare's <em>Jeopardy!</em> games?

<br />Yeah, I know, you can assign shorter codes to the more frequent words. How exactly do you plan on coding the text? Building a dictionary with all the words and assigning codes to them based on how frequent they are? That may work well... Do you have any results yet?
<br />
<br />Hell, with only 4127 distinct words, even if you assigned fixed-sized codes you'd get a decent compression ratio, I guess.

<br />Compression is cool! =D

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Years later, I came back to huffword. I've since learned about a "canonical Huffman" (CH) code, which stores the code as number of words per bit length instead of as a tree. This gives a 7% smaller text than Golomb or gamma without too much more complexity. I managed to round-trip each paragraph through a CH encoder and decoder, though Python is nowhere near the fastest language at bit manip.
<br />
<br />Right now, for the longer novel (431 KiB uncompressed), I get an estimated 112 KiB text, a 36 KiB dictionary (of 5,224 words plus a pointer to each word), and an estimated 8 KiB playback code + font data. It doesn't come anywhere near my original hope of getting it down to a 128 KiB UNROM, but then not even Zip gets it that small (160 KiB), though the memory-intensive BZip2 gets it down to 112 KiB total.
<br />
<br />One concern is how fast I'll be able to decode this on a 6502. I'll have to go through about three layers before anything appears on the screen: CH decoding of word stream to get indices into a pointer table, chasing pointers to the beginning of each dictionary entry, CH decoding of individual dictionary entries, and finally putting the text on the screen.
<br />
<br />Another concern is whether anyone will have the patience to sit through and read a book one page at a time, where each page has about 1 KB of text, on a display that's a lot chunkier than that of a modern smartphone or e-reader. (The active area of my VWF engine's display is roughly 48 characters by 24 lines.) But given that <a href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" class="postlink">this</a> exists...

<br />Also if you used 4 nametables, you could pre-load quite a bit of text and hope they don't read at a constant, really-fast speed, heheh.  Likewise, you could buffer ahead several pages into WRAM and still be using the 2 usual nametables.
<br />
<br />I'd be really interested in having a text compression program.  But I'm sure the texts I would use would be more modest-length, not novels.  Speed doesn't matter to me either, if the result is more interesting text, they can wait. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />I'd need more than nametables for that. I'm using a proportional font, and thanks to my palette hack (left half of the screen white-black-white-black, right half white-white-black-black), I can fit a full screen of monochrome graphics into a shade under 8 KiB of CHR RAM per page. The only board with more CHR RAM than that is CPROM, and that has only 32 KiB of PRG ROM. The ideal mapper for this, if sticking to Nintendo boards, would be either AOROM modded such that the nametable selection bit also controls CHR A13, or perhaps SGROM with bigger CHR RAM.
