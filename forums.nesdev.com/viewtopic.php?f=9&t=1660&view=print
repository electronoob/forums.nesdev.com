		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I've gone and done it again.  CopyNES' host code has been updated.  A few more mappers were added, I included all the fixes that Bootgod provided, and Membler's UfROM cart is now fully supported!
<br />
<br />The UfROM cart is a UNROM cartridge that has flash ROM action, and it can be reprogrammed through CopyNES.  The cute part is that the cartridge can then be played on any NES without modifications.
<br />
<br />The windows version of the software has been updated as well as the DOS version, so both should be in synch with one another.
<br />
<br />To use the UfROM cart, you will have to add a single wire to your CopyNES to get it to work.  Details of this modification will be documented in a couple days when I get around to it.  It involves soldering a wire from the CopyNES board to the cart connector.
<br />
<br />As for kits and conversions, I still have them for sale.

<br />My guess is that it is "Expansion 0", which is pin 16 on the NES edge connector.  I'm basing this on this conversation:

<br />
<br />
<br />Yeppers, it is pin 16.  This pin was chosen, since it would be easy to solder a wire to the cart socket itself, and those pins are exposed on the back of the connector.   When Memblers starts selling them and all that I'll put up a page about how to make the modification.

<br />
<br />The V3 BIOS fixed some rather nasty errors I found in MicroBug which caused it to emulate the PLA and TSX (or was it TXS?) instructions incorrectly. And maybe a few other things I don't remember.

<br />WOW!  I just noticed this as well!  I'm surprised no one else has brought it up (it seems the BIOS was made on 01/03/2006).
<br />
<br />What other bugs were fixed in it?  I just got another kit from Kevin this past week, and it still has V2 on the 27C64 chip!

<br />
<br />Yes.  V3.00 is concidered beta at this point and I did not want to ship it until it's FULLY tested.  as Q mentioned, the only update was to Microbug's emulation of 1 or 2 instructions.  At the time I had no way of testing it under real world conditions running game code, since my TV card wasn't working.  It has since been fixed so I will probably test it soon and release it from beta and start shipping it.
<br />
<br />V3.00 does not affect any other operation (such as dumping, Bankwatch, etc)
