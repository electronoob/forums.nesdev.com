I'm guessing those RAs are supposed to do at least some sort of limiting, even if they are just resistor arrays and not proper level shifters.<br /><br />@gauauu<br />Thank you for the counterexample. But can any Igavania be adapted to the 1-button paradigm, or must the entire franchise be designed from the start to support 1-button play?

I can't imagine most existing games of this genre would adapt well.<br /><br />But I'd also say that the vast majority of platforming games in general would fail to be a good candidate for a converstion to 1-button play. Sure, there's a few that are based mostly on running and jumping (Sonic, Mario, etc), but combat-based platformers (Contra, Mega Man, Ninja Gaiden) would be a big disappointment. Puzzle platformers (Lost Vikings, Eskimo Bob) would also fail.

There are lighting effects and smooth moving lava, far better than the NES can do.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">This should give you some idea of what the current mindset is of people gaming today. Even folks &quot;our&quot; age (40s, or late 30s) who were around for the NES and SNES launches, and grew up with them, have trouble not comparing the quality of retro games (esp. homebrew) to &quot;other stuff&quot; out on the market.</div><br /><br />I've played the game and from a players perspective, I'd have to say this is a harsh, yet honest review.<br /><br />Around this place, we're acutely aware of the effort and knowledge required to get even the most basic of demos off the ground on these old systems, but I feel that because of that, we often get hung up on technical details and forget the most important thing:<br />That games are meant to played and that games should be a fun and interesting experience for the player.<br /><br />The world has kept on spinning in the decades since our favorite systems have been released, with lots of game design lessons learned, lots of gameplay conventions cemented and lots of stellar commercial releases that upped the bar for what is considered a good game, plus players have a vastly increased amount of games available to them and a diminished timespan available for each individual game.<br /><br />So yes, if you publically release a game in 2018, it will be compared to everything that came before it, be it the best on that system, current-gen games or retro-styled games on modern platforms.<br />And if you ignore what's happened since, release a buggy game, get sloppy with the level design or don't polish the gameplay, you will be called out for it.<br /><br />Instead of lamenting this fact, I tried to embrace it with the latest released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99-v8lkoOdo" class="postlink">SNES game I've worked on</a> and distinguish it by focussing on the following:<br />-polished gameplay first, no compromises<br />-zero-bug policy<br />-no filler, cherish the players time (no repetitious, tedious or overly difficult level design to pad out playing time)<br />-improved replayability (collectable secrets, unlockable simultaneous multiplayer mode)<br /><br />It has its fair share of blemishes (SNES-CD-version not working on real hardware, uses intellectual property of others, very short total playtime), but I'm still content with the result.<br /><br />Regarding Sydney Hunter, I applaud the effort:<br />Creating a complete game, manufacturing cartridges and packaging are a monumental accomplishment in itself, and the sprite animations do look great.<br />Still, the lack of polish feels a bit like a missed opportunity to me.<br /><br />tl;dr: Don't let seemingly unfair/uninformed critique put you off. Instead, consider which valid points it makes, know where your audience is coming from, know what you're up against and polish, polish, polish. Just my 2 cents.

It's genuinely a 49-way digital input device.  Normal digital joysticks are a 9-way input (center and ±1 in each x/y direction makes a 3x3 grid), while the 49-way has 3 discrete intensities in each x/y direction, yielding a 7x7 grid of possible positions.
