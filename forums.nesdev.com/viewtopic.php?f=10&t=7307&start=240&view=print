<br />
<br />YY-CHR lets you paste images from the clipboard (up to 128x128), and it is converted to CHR data immediately on paste.  It works best if the image is in indexed color format, so make sure your paint program lets you specify it.  Photoimpact is really good for this task, since it lets you do color reduction and re-ordering the palette the way you want to, I'm not as experienced with other paint programs.  Truecolor images often get mangled when pasting into YY-CHR, because it can't match the colors to an index correctly.

<br />Your NMI couting code is useless if you are not initializing $2000. Initializing the PPU by writing to $2000 and $2001 at least once is a mandatory thing for NES programs.

<br />It means basically to simply look at a [software/hardware] flag/condition, normally periodically. You can see "by polling" the alternative of "by interrupts". Normally, "by interrupts" is better, but because, at power on, the PPU isn't reliable, it's better to "poll" the state of the VBlank flag.

<br />It means you constantly read a register until the returned value changes. In the case of $2002, the most significant bit tells you when VBlank starts, so you can read it in a loop and wait for the N flag (which is a copy of bit 7) to be set, like this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Wait:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda $2002<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bpl Wait</div>
<br />While the flag is clear, you keep waiting. Do that twice and you'll have waited 2 frames. This is why I said that the length of the frame doesn't matter in this case.
