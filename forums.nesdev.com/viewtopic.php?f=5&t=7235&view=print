<br />
<br />Well, I was selected to do the panel.  I'll be up there solo, since no one is attending that's currently doing a game.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I was planning to of course talk about my stuff, how I began simple and into more complex games.  I was also thinking of talking about some other folks' projects briefly to just showcase them, so the audience could see what's out there.  I'd be running all this from my laptop via ROMs.
<br />
<br />I'm putting this message out there as I will only show someone's game if said person wants this done.  So if you have anything you want me to say, you'll need to let me know.

<br />
<br />And thats nice to show off some other people work. Thanks for considering that. I'm sure some people will love to see their stuff demo'd.

<br />
<br />But most project are unfinished so maybe some people may do mind after all. Me what I did is nothing special and since it was a proof of concept, I don't know if I will ever finish it someday. You can show it, I don't mind but it doesn't do much <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />In response to this... yeah I do have a game rom released in the wild, but I'd rather it not be shown at something like this even if it can already be played by anyone. It's not animated, has no sound/music, most didn't like the controls, and it's a clone. It is always good to ask, for sure.

<br />I can't answer a lot of questions on behalf of others' projects either, but merely show them.
<br />
<br />So...  if you want anything to potentially be shown, you need to mention it.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />
