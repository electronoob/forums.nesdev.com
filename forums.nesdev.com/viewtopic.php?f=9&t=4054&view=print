		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1) If you were to map (e.g.) RAM in the CPU from $4000 to $5fff, clearly you'd get bus conflicts on reading the joysticks ($4016, $4017). But do you get a conflict on reading from internal registers (e.g. $4015)? On a write to $4000 to $4017, does the value appear on the data bus?
<br />
<br />With RAM there it clearly doesn't matter if you write nonsense to the bottom 24 addresses, but ROM or other peripherals would be a different question.
<br />
<br />2) So the NES uses a 74'139 to produce the select signals for the WRAM and the PPU. They use one of the two selectors to decode /(A15&amp;PH2) (clearly forwarded to the cartridge) and /(/A15&amp;PH2), and the other takes that (as the enable) and A14 and A13 to generate the /CS for the WRAM and the PPU. (thus enabling them to not need a separate 4-NAND for the WRAM /CS)
<br />
<br />So the point is, how does having the /(A15&amp;PH2) signal on the cartridge simplify the decoing logic there? (Otherwise they could have used a 74'138 and allocated less addressable space to each of the WRAM and PPU)
<br />
<br />2.5) Any ideas on why they put A15 and D0-D7 on the expansion port, but nothing else directly useful? It seems likely that the inputs to the 74'368s and outputs from the $4016 latch are there to allow you to use famicom peripherals on the NES, given the right converter.
<br />
<br />3) It would be a fairly simple piece of logic to allow more than 4 screens (the $2000-$2fff stuff in the PPU) -- just detect the single cycle gap (on pixel 341) and adjust one of the PPU address lines with a signal that goes from 0 to 1 on name table fetches when it starts fetching name table from the left page after fetching from the right page on the same scanline. Because the PPU fetches the two leftmost background blocks during the previous scanline, this would work badly with copper effects -- but it would work on all scanlines because of the dummy fetches on scanline 20. Would this be at all useful?
<br />
<br />Relatedly, has anyone ever made a hack (or real thing?) that uses the 2k VRAM as both name table and pattern table (to reduce part count)? With only 64 patterns, it wouldn't look very good, but it would be enough to, say, build a cart containing Escape from Pong.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1) Yes in both cases.
<br />
<br />2) They used /(A15&amp;PHI2) to not need any logic on cartridges, it's assumed on the first cartridges that every time $8000-FFFF was put on the address bus, a read would happen.
<br />
<br />Why does it matter how Nintendo discretely implemented the memory map? There are tons of things they could have done to make it both cheaper and arguably better, but it all came down to the taste of the designer.
<br />
<br />To my knowledge nobody has used VRAM for patterns probably since no emulator has implemented this.
<br />
<br />PS: I'm shocked to see another from Mass!

Would this be at all useful? </div><br />With a 8KB SRAM you could easily do this. You'd want to have its /CE mapped to /A13, so that it's enabled for nametables, and have it's pins A10, A11 &amp; A12 mapper controlled, so that you could get 8 possible screens for all 4 nametable regions, all randomly acessible. You'd need a decent mapper hardware tough, to latch 4x3 bits, at least 3 74'161 + 74'39 needed (probably more if you want something decent).<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">1) If you were to map (e.g.) RAM in the CPU from $4000 to $5fff, clearly you'd get bus conflicts on reading the joysticks ($4016, $4017).

Reading joypad is a little harder to avoid, but if you're writing a demo, there may be no need of them. Or else add a '138 or something like that, to decode joypad adresses and disable RAM here.<br />In fact this would even allow you to buffer hardware writes to sound registers, which is cool. You could do lda $4000 and return the last value written to $4000, which would be great.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">2.5) Any ideas on why they put A15 and D0-D7 on the expansion port, but nothing else directly useful?

<br />Well, I guess they put A15 because they felt bad about not putting it on the real cartridge port or something like that, so you could redirect it if you needed it on a cart. All FC carts had to work without it tough.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No they're not, when the CPU reads $4016, the R/W line is up and the data bus is effectively set at the value on which the joypad port is (but there is only D0-D2 connected if I'm remembering correctly). A RAM enabled on the bus at the same time *will* conflict with the joypads.
