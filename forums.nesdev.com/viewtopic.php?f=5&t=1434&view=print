<br />
<br />But it plays 100X better.
<br />
<br />Plenty of baseball games to choose from (even more on Famicom, heh), out of all those, Baseball Simulator 1.000 and Bad News Baseball are my favorite ones.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well there are two other baseball games that I would rank up there with Bad News Baseball, Baseball Simulator 1,000 and those are Base Wars (lets face it you can't beat robots beating the hell out of each other), Legends of the Diamond which has some interesting things in it like dogs running out on the field to pick up foul balls. Plus you can pick from a variable list of legends in the sport. Oh yeah, I forgot to metion that if you hit someone with a pitch or vice versa there was a chance they would charge the mound and attack the pitcher.

<br />
<br />It is a port of "Famista" (no year). The many Japanese sequels (Famista '87 through '94 I believe) bear no resemblance to the US sequels (RBI 2, 3).
<br />
<br />Shameless plug: RBI Baseball has quite an active following at <a href="http://dee-nee.com/rbi/" class="postlink">Dee-Nee.com</a>.

<br />
<br />There's a few Baseball Stars fans, and there've been a few requests for BS-editing software, but I'm just not motivated enough to do it. Besides, I like RBI much better.

<br />
<br />Does anyone know what Japanese game Bad News Baseball is based on? I've looked all over, but can't find it. And also does anyone know of an editor for Bad NEws?
