<br />  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/sns.htm">http://nocash.emubase.de/sns.htm</a><!-- m -->
<br />the thing should be quite accurate, support most coprocessors, and work with almost all games. But well, it's the first release, so I may have missed a lot of bugs...
<br />Looking for some feedback if it does really work!
<br />cu, Martin

<br />
<br />Same thing happens with World Cup Soccer 2 - Striker (E).

<br />The clone is breaking the original code into 5 sections: Part 1 reproduces the orignal opcodes at FFC0-FFCE, Part 2 those at FFCF-FFD5, and so on.
<br />So, the FFC9 entrypoint value that you are using isn't working. I've read somewhere that it is "possible" to jump to that address (and was wondering if any programs are actually <strong>doing</strong> that). Well, now I know it... will be working in next update. Thanks again.
<br />PS. I hope the sound output as such is okay.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Congratulations! I'm always excited to see new SNES emulators.
<br />
<br />I noticed this in your documentation:
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">  F3  Debug (receive 128Kbytes from 0000:0000..0001:FFFF, for HEX-DUMP display)<br />  F4  Debug (receive 32Kbytes from A000:0000..A000:7FFF, for HEX-DUMP display)<br /><br />With the Debug commands, it'd might exceptionally easy to dump the on-chip BIOS ROM (without needing to decap the chip), but so far nobody seems to have done/tried to do so (???)</div>
<br />
<br />I must have missed the F3/F4 commands when I was researching this game. This was a big help, thank you.
<br />Since I used your research, I wanted to make sure I gave you credit for it. As my setup is capable of handling this:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KTGj4l.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Here are the extracted 128K and 32K files:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://byuu.org/temp/st0018-20120225.tar.bz2">http://byuu.org/temp/st0018-20120225.tar.bz2</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />They appear to be valid, I see "Copyright 1994 RAHDOMHOUSE" in the 128K file.
<br />
<br />I wasn't having much luck with A3 {32-bit addr} {read 128-bytes}; but I can also dump the full 4GB range if you can elaborate on how that command works. I'd also love to know how you obtained this info if you don't mind, as anything will be helpful to me.
<br />
<br />I hope this will be of use to you. If we make any progress on these, I'll pass the information along.
<br />
<br />Lastly, I am also writing an SNES emulator. You may be interested in looking at its source for further information.
<br />You can download that here if you like: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://code.google.com/p/bsnes/downloads/list">http://code.google.com/p/bsnes/downloads/list</a><!-- m -->
<br />I also have a forum with several years of research notes at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://board.byuu.org/">http://board.byuu.org/</a><!-- m -->
<br />Please don't hesitate to reach out to me any time if you have questions or want to team up on a tough new problem, I'd be glad to help.
<br />I'd also love to hear about any new research from your end, too!

<br />But if something can wrong... then it happen just at the the wrong moment, sorry. The emubase server has been offline for some hours last week, too (don't know why). I hope it'll be back online tomorrow, or else I'll upload a copy somewhere else. Thanks that you mentioned the problem!

<br />The e-mail address in the spam-shielded box is incorrect. The second r is missing. (Confirmed against the hex.)
<br />
<br />Just for fun I thought I'd as you, do you have a DOS build of no$sns? I still have a P100 and I want to see how it compares to ZSNES in speed on such an old machine.

There are third party software that can read the files to some degree, but I would suggest distributing help files as HTML files. Maybe it's anti nocash in spirit, but it would help all of us with modern computers with "hundreds of megahertz". <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
