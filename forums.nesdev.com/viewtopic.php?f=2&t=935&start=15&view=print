<br />I didn't understand the meaing of this senstence, but MMC5 can only run CHR ROM.
<br />However, even with one-tile limited attribute, that still doesn't allow me to change attributes diagonally, this only allow me to have one-tile precision instead of four-tiles precision. Color glitches would definitely be less horrible with MMC5, but that doesn't help me to know how to planify tilesets (which are, okay, indefinite with MMC5) or how to planify nametables.
<br />I think the map should first be converted in 2D in RAM, then drawn on the screen. That's the only way to make the screen scolling and have a game decently working with isometric graphics.

<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/iso3.gif" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />And that could get pretty boring. What will all the levels be about? Climbing mountains? I know that clipping the sprites so that they can go behind blocks can be a pain, but there must be a way. Even if we clip at the 8x8 tile level, as happens in <em>Sonic 3D Blast</em> sometimes (when entering tunnels or with the loops). However, I think sprite masks could do the job, if one is feeling generous about sprites.
<br />
<br />Think about it... if there is such a limitation, simple things like this would not be possible:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/iso4.gif" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />We should just play isometric games to get some ideas... I'm not saying to copy anything, it's just so we can get a light on the attribute thing...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />tokumaru : You got well the limitation I was thinking about. Do you really think it would be that boring ? With just green blocks it may look boring, but with more complex backgrounds and much, much larger maps with threes, rivers, etc... on it, I don't fell it would be boring.
<br />There is a lot of problems with a block being behind another one.
<br />Look :
<br /><img src="http://jonathan.microclub.ch/iso4.GIF" alt="Image" />
<br />Doesn't that green surface looks both to be above the others (as you would it to be), if you look from the bottom to the top, or look to be the one "behind" the one you would it to be, if you look from the top to the bottom ? In that case, the two yellow cliffs would "hide" this particular block, and in the case you would show, the block that is higher than the others mask 100% of the block behind it. That is really anoying in games when its happen, making me prefer 2D games, simply because I like to see everything clearly on screen. However, if that block would be twice less high, one small portion of the one behind would still be visible, making thing looks a bit clearer.
<br />So the ideal would be to allow only a "behind" block to be one half of the base map's lenght lower than the one in front of it, making confusion impossible, and give to the game a bit of depht. That's what I think Tactics Ogre does. If you want more, you should play on a 3D system that is able to rotate the map.
<br />And please let me know how did you draw those samples blocks, else I'll get upset. I really don't understand how that works.
<br />
<br />For sprite clipping, it would just need some sprites with higher priority but backgroudn bit set. That would work fine, but the 8-sprite limitation can get all things to gabrage.
<br />
<br />Edit : The problem I mention above appears in Tactics Ogre
<br />That blocks seems to the user bo be non-existing
<br /><img src="http://jonathan.microclub.ch/to1.JPG" alt="Image" />
<br />since this one is higer, and has the same on-screen position

<br />Sure it worked well but that doesn't satisfy everyone, especially not in this post. IMO, Qbert was rubbish anyway, and the NES deserves much better.

<br />Actually, the first level of Snake 'n' Roll DOES have that limitation. Scince I'm unable to even know how I'm suposed to get the second level, I cannot say about the rest of the game.

I just used basic blocks like these:<br /><img src="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/iso5.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />In fact, these blocks show very well what we're dealing with. With blocks this size, we'd have to be prepared for some floor/floor, floor/wall, wall/wall encounters, but not too many. Of course it will get more complex when you add slopes, half-height blocks, etc.<br /><br />A while ago I was thinking of making an isometric game, and drew some tests images like this:<br /><img src="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/iso6.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The structure of the blocks (just flat blocks, better textures were to come) here is a bit different from what I proposed above. I did it like this so that when black lines crossed there would be no weird visual effects, but this method requires some extra tiles, beyond the ones presented before.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">For sprite clipping, it would just need some sprites with higher priority but backgroudn bit set.

<br />
<br />When you said that I spent some time thinking and figured you were right. But then I checked and there seems to be some hidden areas in there:<a href="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/snake2.png" class="postlink">http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/snake2.png</a> I took the image from the web and circled one of the hidden areas. I don't know if they're accessible or not, since I haven't played this in a while.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Yeah, I played the game and it turns out these are not hidden areas, but areas with angled walls, so the player can't go there and that makes sense. HOWEVER, the player can go behind blocks when inside the water. In the case of this game, it is easy to implement this if the water's color is color 0.

<br />Yes it is, but more in that "puzzle game kinda way", as the game blargg pointed out. A game that is just "blocky" for the sake of it is very different from a game that wants to simulate a real enviroment in a pseudo-3D way. But, due to the low-end hardware we have we end up having to represent the world with blocks, but a more realistic world nonetheless.
