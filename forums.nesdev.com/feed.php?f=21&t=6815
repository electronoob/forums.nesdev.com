GNU Make ordinarily comes alongside a compiler toolchain such as GCC. Under Ubuntu, it's one of the things you get when you <strong>sudo apt-get install build-essential</strong>; under Windows, it's one of the things you get when you install MSYS with devkitPro tools or MinGW. It's a way of specifying what files are created from other files so that the programs to rebuild them are run in the correct order and possibly at the same time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Feb 02, 2011 6:06 am</p><hr />

It's coming together pretty well, but things still look too similar. Check out this tutorial site (peek at chapter 3 and 4 specifically).<br /><br />Also the shading seems uneven. Try and think of where your light source is coming from and try and texture everything with that in mind. For example: The houses look like they're lit from above+front. The tree leaves look like they're lit from above+behind, yet the tree casts a shadow like it's lit from above+front.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.petesqbsite.com/sections/tutorials/tuts/tsugumo/default.htm" class="postlink">http://www.petesqbsite.com/sections/tutorials/tuts/tsugumo/default.htm</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4681">BARBEERIAN</a> — Tue Jan 04, 2011 2:39 pm</p><hr />

Tepples, your second pic is a major improvement over the first one. It looks really great, a NES game with graphics like these would sure be awesome !<br /><br />If there were something to be improved, I'd say add random white dots in the water (which looks plain blue here). Don't remember which game I got this technique from, but it makes the water looks shiny and looks better,<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Aug 10, 2010 1:04 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">neilbaldwin wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I keep defaulting back to YYCHR just because the results are fairly immediate<br /></div><br />If you want to make good graphics, I suggest you don't use tile editors. Since they usually force you to draw inside small regions, your art ends up looking pretty blocky. It's not that you can't make awesome fluid graphics with them, but the fact that you can only edit small regions at a time makes the process much more tedious, so you end up not touching the art up as much. It seems that you can paste images into YYCHR though, and for that purpose (converting tiles) I guess it's OK.<br /><br />I use MSPaint to draw all my pixel art.

It looks a lot better with the new palette.  That's pretty cool.<br /><br />I think a 2 or 3 different types of small plants to use in the grass would make it look more natural and balance out the trees a bit.  Just sort of randomly placed (could be more in the grass near the river), could be some sparsely-distributed wildflowers if you have a free color.  Kinda kills the RLE compression, I know, heheh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Aug 09, 2010 3:40 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Do I still suck, or am I getting the hang of this?<br /></div><br />Looks nice, but I see a few problems: The perspective of the tree doesn't seem to match the rest, it looks too bi-dimensional. The roof looks a bit out of place too, because everything has a black outline, except for it.<br /><br />Speaking of outlines, I think that they can make backgrounds look less professional sometimes. I don't know if I think that because cartoons have foreground objects outlined but not the background, but I know that most of the pixel art I look up to doesn't have outlines, not even on the sprites.<br /><br />Outlines can probably be used on the background, but then I think you have to pick a style. Outlines go well with flat colors, not with heavy dithering and complex textures. Your mock-up does have some clashing styles that should be resolved.<br /><br />Anyway, I don't think your art is bad at all tepples. From what I've seen of your work it looks simplistic, but not bad. With art like that you can make really cute games that nobody will think look bad. They might lean more towards older NES games than newer ones, but that isn't necessarily bad.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Aug 05, 2010 7:28 pm</p><hr />
