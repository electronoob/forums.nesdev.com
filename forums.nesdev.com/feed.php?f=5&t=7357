It's too bad Sauder or Ikea doesn't sell arcade cabinet kits, although someone <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5022607/ikea-%252B-apple--mamebook-cocktail" class="postlink">jury-rigged an Ikea Ramvik</a> as a cocktail.<br /><br />A problem with rigging an encoder out of a USB gamepad is that you have to make absolutely sure you don't miss a coin press. Going with a keyboard encoder, as you suggested, might be superior.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Tue Jan 18, 2011 8:48 am</p><hr />

No arcade cabinets for me, but I did build a JAMMA SuperGun. I recently began working on it again. Finally wired up the second player controller. The main thing remaining to do to it is paint the main box, the controllers are already painted. <br /><br />If I had the room, it would be sweet to have a nice cabinet with a big monitor. But it works out this way being able to use the same RGB monitor for arcade games as I do my retro consoles like PCE, Genesis, SNES, etc.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Mon Jan 17, 2011 12:54 pm</p><hr />

I bought the cabinet for $100 from a guy here in town, though it was more like trading two older computers someone had given me. I had the diodes already from another project so they didnt cost anything. I spent $37 (including shipping) for the Flyback, transistors, caps, the two pigtail fuses. I have current spent $137 and everything is technically working with the exception of a few small things. (the second coin slot is missing one of the levers and the memory protect and bookkeeping switches need to be replaced).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25">WhoaMan</a> — Thu Jan 13, 2011 1:37 pm</p><hr />

the parts arrived on Monday like i suspected they would, though I did not get a chance to redo the board until last night due to a crazy work schedule.

I took a few pics <a href="http://membler-industries.com/memblers/pics/" class="postlink">http://membler-industries.com/memblers/pics/</a><br />When I say it's in good shape, I mean for it's age, heheh.  Coin counter on the PC10 is 21,487 (and still counts).  Counter counter on Boot Camp/SF2 CE is 114,697 and looks like it hasn't been hooked up for a while.  That's a lot of quarters.<br /><br />Notice on the SF2 when I replaced the joysticks I got the colors backwards from the "traditional" 1P blue 2P red that lots of stuff used.  Oh well, I haven't yet cleaned the rust out of it either.<br /><br />The project cab just looks like junk under a tarp for now.  There were huge holes (from the Police Trainer guns) all over the front that I filled in with bondo, sanded it down, I want to paint it next spring.<br /><br />Yeah the PC10 cabinet was just luck, Xious here on the forums mentioned it and it was reasonably close to me.  Before that I got the VS board as a gift, I thought I was gonna get a Nintendo-Jamma adapter but ended up with a real Nintendo cabinet, heh.<br /><br />Picking up that 4-player Konami cabinet was the tragedy of a lifetime though.  The guy also had a VS DualSystem cabinet (mostly gutted, but still..) and was happy to give it to me.  But I had nowhere I could put it, there's no way it could fit into my home.  Maybe he still has it, he had other good stuff for cheap too, if you're around central Ohio (I'm not, but was passing through the area pretty often).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Jan 05, 2011 7:35 pm</p><hr />

You have to pick your hardware though. I'd go for Defender's hardware, it has bankswitching. Stargate doesn't have bankswitching. And then there's the special chips for moving memory or not, you can homebrew on that too. One good thing is that sound is on a seperate board and all you do is send codes to it and it plays it. Bad thing is unless your good, it's only one channel, since it's a 8-Bit DAC.<br /><br /><br />And one BAD thing about this is that the RAM thats use able is scattered throughout it. It has X bytes on screen, X bytes in HBLANK, X bytes on screen, X Bytes in HBLANK so you have to calculate what's useable and what's not. Then you'll probably have to do what they did with defender and put the stack on the left side of the screen and adjust it off.<br /><br /><br />If you homebrew, just use a good 6809 assembler and then a 6800 for the sound board. That should make you good for a while. 6809 is very fun to code although this platform might be difficult, it'll be a cool adventure. If you do this you should keep me posted. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Wed Jan 05, 2011 5:46 pm</p><hr />

<strong>3gengames</strong>: <br />I have been toying with the idea of development on the "classic" williams systems as well, on breaks at work I have been messing with the idea of writing a disassembler that should allow me to disassemble Stargate a bit easier. Between the schematics for the boards and a disassembly... i should be good to go. Have you seen <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.seanriddle.com/willy.html">http://www.seanriddle.com/willy.html</a><!-- m --> ? I stumbled upon it last night and it seem to have some good stuff on it. sadly the data files he used with a disassembler are missing... but oh wells. As far as the cabinet damage to my Stargate, besides being beat up with various scratches and what not, the lower front section of the cabinet that the coin door and coin box are mounted to have split down the center... i suppose i could just replace that section but I figure it would be funner to make a new cabinet.<br /><br /><strong>Memblers</strong>:<br />Sounds like you have quite the collection starting up, happen to have any pictures? I am rather jealous that you have a playchoice 10. I almost bought one from a local tattoo shop a few years back but was unable to. There is a pizza place a few hours from where I live that has a broken VS Super Mario Bros cabinet, I have been wanting to snag that one for a while though they sadly dont want to sell it. I had been wanting to get an arcade cabinet for quite a while and came really close to getting a Shinobi convert, but the seller bailed on our deal at the last minute.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25">WhoaMan</a> — Wed Jan 05, 2011 4:13 pm</p><hr />
