Hi All,<br /><br />I have in my possession one storage case for Famicom games that looks like a plastic, cream coloured briefcase, which holds 24 games and has locking clasps. <br /><br />I am looking for more carries of the same style, or for any kind of cartridge carriers, storage cases storage trays and disk files or disk carriers for either FDS diskettes or the more generic QuickDisk diskettes that were popular in Nippon once upon a time.<br /><br />If anybody on this board has something along these lines that they would be willing to sell or trade, please get in touch with me. <br /><br />Sure, I could make my own, but the original stuff is just too cool, especially the briefcase style as it makes the games look ominous...<br /><br />I’d like a couple more of this style to sort my games by category (Puzzle/platformer/Action/etc.) and I'd really-a-lot like a disk tray for my FDS diskettes to keep my most commonly used games handy in a protected manner...<br /><br />Does anybody have something to offer me?<br /><br />-Xious<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Thu Mar 04, 2010 3:19 am</p><hr />
