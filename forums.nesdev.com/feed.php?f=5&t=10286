Luckily I've found a job in IT where I'm not on-call, and I don't take my work home with me. It's relatively stress-free. The only thing that really causes stress is the threat of being laid off when the company decides that to make more money this year, they'll cut down on payroll. But I suppose that's a possibility wherever you go (unless you're self-employed).<br /><br />I plan on moving on to non-IT things some day. My plan has been to start venturing into those things on the side after my day job. Once I can start making money off of those things, and that income exceeds my regular job, I'll cut the wire, possibly. I've written a novel that is in the revision stages, and I'd like to get that done and see about publishing it. I don't expect for that to make more money than my day job, but you never know. There are other creative projects in the works that could be profitable, but are not even mostly complete.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Fri Jan 10, 2014 11:04 am</p><hr />

It has it's up sides and down sides. Before the recession, pay wasn't too bad (though nothing like the IT job I had). Pay hasn't changed so much now, as so much to the lesser amount of work that I get nowadays. I scaled back my living style/expenses, originally, when I left the IT field. I prioritized what I wanted for myself and what I wanted out of life, and was able to live reasonably well. Though while I've sacrificed any long term benefit and definitely my retirement, the amount of stress was ~near~ 0. A fair trade IMO. I made a gamble; even if I lived to be old(er) - would I be happy with my life? More or less, I traded the future - for the 'now', while I was still young enough to enjoy it. <br /><br /> I was able to put more time in my high tech hobbies, as well. I was able to spend more time with my sons, raise them, actually be there mentally when I was at home/off work. I ~loved~ being stress free and the fact that I didn't have to take my 'job' home with me, every night. Some times work was physically exhausting, but that's nothing compared to being mentally exhausted. When you come home after a hard day's work, you can actually relax - and recovery time is short. I could never do that before, with mental stress - not really. But it seems now, some of my priorities/needs in life have changed since then. Going back to school and getting back into a technical field (or any specialized field), is what I need to do now.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3645">tomaitheous</a> — Thu Jan 09, 2014 7:03 pm</p><hr />

I'm currently a developer of in-house software for a major retailer (I don't think I can say who it is). It's software for a specific division (so not the whole company), so the audience isn't thousands of people. It's mostly VB.Net programming and database stuff. I actually really enjoy my job. It's relatively easy programming for me, but I also get to be creative in how I design forms/tools for people to use. I got the job after getting my AAS in Software Development, and have been working for almost 2 years.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Thu Jan 09, 2014 11:13 am</p><hr />

In my job, I'm a technician.  It's with a small company, so I wear other hats too, as needed.  But I mostly focus on production, burn-in and functional tests of boards, calibration, quality control, board mods and upgrades (including preventive maintenance), and evaluate/repair boards that have been in the field.  It's critical equipment for all types of medical research, among other stuff.  So I can take it seriously, and have fun because I like working with electronics and learning.  Been doing that full-time for about 4 years.<br /><br />Before that, I worked for a small chemical company.  Blending product, packaging it, and I had a CDL with hazmat endorsement (everything we handled was either extremely corrosive, or extremely flammable, heheh), so I was the delivery driver as well.  I got pretty good at pushing around 55-gallon drums.  There was also some distribution involved that had me traveling to towns all over northern Indiana, n. Ohio, and s. Michigan.  That was fun, some of it was during the days of using old fashioned paper maps, too.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Jan 08, 2014 10:37 pm</p><hr />

I used to work in the IT field, but I eventually got bored and sick of the whole thing (1996-2003). Since then, I've worked only non-technical/technology kind of jobs. The past 4 years, I've been doing this:<br /><img src="http://www.pcedev.net/work/pic1.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.pcedev.net/work/pic2.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />Kind of... mural-ish things, if you will. They're just silhouettes, but they can be really big (60ft wide be 12ft tall). It's all free hand, but I'm not allowed to make up what I want. I'm given a pic for reference, as to what to paint on the wall. Though I tend to take liberties, cause I get bored. It's all done by hand; I sketch it all out with a small brush first - then start adding in details. Sometimes, the pics are huge repeating patterns. That's a bit more difficult to get right, by hand. But I have a system down for it. I've been doing this for stores, and it can up to a month to complete a store (about 100-120 hours). <br /><br /> Though, I've been trying my hardest to go back to school.

Yeah, your totally right. Best to just not put yourself in that position in the first place if you can avoid it. However, doing dev at home, in a non-competing fashion from your employer, for your own purposes as long as you use your own computer with your own power and at your own house I  would just do it anyway, or maybe switch jobs then do it anyway. I wouldn't put up with something like that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4854">Zelex</a> — Tue Jan 07, 2014 9:23 pm</p><hr />

You're missing the point.  Coming from someone who has been through lengthy legal ordeals before, it's just best not to have court dates, attorneys (and their fees) and the mental stress associated with managing your life around such legal obstacles.<br /><br />You could hire a lawyer to defend yourself who MIGHT just have the legal know-how to protect you with the right state legal statutes, and you might have a judge that is willing to look past the fact that you willingly signed a document stating that your creative output from home and work belongs to your employer, but again the chances are slim in both situations.<br /><br />Sometimes lawyers don't show up and may even include stipulations in the contract that you signed with them that whether or not they show up their fees are not refundable.  (Hasn't happened to me, but when I was shopping around I saw some contracts like that...)<br /><br />Remember that you can amend contracts with people before you sign them.  You aren't obligated to sign anything or say anything to anyone that you do not wish to sign or say.  But if you do, you may be facing undesired consequences.  In this case, you may be out of a job, paycheck deductions, lawyer fees, and paying for other types of things to combat and relieve stress; adding up to a few thousands of dollars.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />As for what I do professionally, I work with aggressive, autistic and MR youth in a residential setting as a counselor of applied behavior analysis.  I'm in school studying religious studies and counseling to be an interfaith chaplain in a prison, nursing home, or mental hospital.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3466">B00daW</a> — Tue Jan 07, 2014 8:58 pm</p><hr />

All it takes is one time the wrong person knowing what you're up to, and you could have a big problem on your hands. It's a pretty significant risk.<br /><br />And, hey, maybe it's a risk worth taking. It depends on the situation-- tepples was just coming at it speculatively, I think, but the kind of stipulations you get in a lot of work contracts very often take explicit ownership of stuff like this, and depending on the company it could be a huge risk to try and do stuff like this on the clock. (Under a lot of contracts, it's a risk to do this kind of stuff at home too. Last time I was looking for a job, I turned down an otherwise decent offer because they wanted ownership of my creative output at home as well as at work. It may sound weird, but I know a ton of people that have accepted contracts like this.)<br /></div><br /><br />I'm pretty sure thats not legally enforceable. Not that you wouldn't have to take it to court to prove it, but still - just because its in a contract doesn't mean its enforceable. For example, in california I'm 100% sure that is totally illegal for them to do whether you signed it or not.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4854">Zelex</a> — Mon Jan 06, 2014 8:09 pm</p><hr />
