		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />one thing I've noticed almost all NES disassemblers lack is support for mappers and multiple rom banks.. and its not surprising.  I want to add this feature to DASM6, but I'd like to get some insight from those who are more familiar with dealing with mappers than i am
<br />
<br />To disassemble a rom with a mapper, there are the following difficulties:
<br /><strong>1. Knowing how the rom file is mapped into memory.  </strong>
<br />
<br />For some mappers this is relatively straightforward (ex mapper 2), but for others, it's totally up to the programmer.  We can use CDL logs to know where in memory the file was mapped to, but even then, it's technically possible for the same bytes in the file to be loaded into either rom bank, so a CDL log might not be 100% correct
<br />
<br /><strong>possible solutions:</strong>
<br />* allow use of user provided memory map in addition to CDL
<br />* don't support games which put the same bank in two locations
<br />* ?
<br />
<br />
<br /><strong>2. Knowing how to deal with label references which are outside of the current bank</strong>
<br />
<br /> for example, lets say a game has a bank hard coded to 0xc000, and code in that bank jumps to someplace around 0x8000.  But which bank is it jumping to?  It's possible that the proper destination for the jump code is only in one bank.. but we don't know which bank.  
<br />
<br />Assuming it exists in all banks will mess up the output of the other banks
<br />
<br /><strong>possible solutions</strong>
<br />* only allow "code" labels (mentioned in jmp/jsr/branch) from other banks if CDL says it's code and also the label points to an opcode, not inside of a command.  and conversely only allow data labels (lda/sta) if CDL says it's data
<br />* allow user defined labels to also specify which bank it exists in (seems like we'll need this anyways) and add label to that bank if the user specified it.  using this alone could lead to invalid labels though.. so maybe output a list of labels which weren't found and force user to define them?
<br />
<br />
<br />i separated this from my DASM6 thread since it could be handy for other disassembler authors.. would love to hear about other problems and solutions to disassembling roms which use mappers.  
<br />
<br />funny thing is just writing this out has helped me brainstorm lol

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Usually the "fixed bank" either hardwired into it or something, and then like defender, other routines are switched in and out as needed. So knowing which bank it's in will be hard. But the main code should be all in grouped banks close together. Subroutines that are shared in another, then another for other routines? It depends on how the programmer did it, but that's how I'd do it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know how you'd implement this reliably.  Some mappers permit multiple bank sizes (4KB vs. 8KB vs. 16KB for example) which a programmer can toggle on-the-fly by writes to memory-mapped mapper register space (too many "m"s!!!).  Your disassembler would literally have to have a 6502 emulator in it and emulate the entire console to map writes to those registers -- don't think "watching" LDA/STA would suffice, because they don't (as I'm sure you know there are multitudes of ways to write a byte to an address on the 6502).
<br />
<br />I tend to recommend that disassemblers permit the person using them to provide a file offset via a command-line argument (e.g. -x 12345), as well as an explicit bank size (e.g. -s 8192).  Supporting unit types for the bank size (e.g. -s 8K) would be useful too (UNIX dd has support for this and lots of people rely on it).

<br />I'm not sure what he's referring to there either.  Possibly data vs. code disambiguation, but I believe your software already does that to some degree.  But I have no idea what "let the user know what the general bank of ROM is for".  I'll tell you what it's for: "stuff".  Bank 0 =stuff.  Bank 1 = stuff.  Bank 2 = stuff...

<br />
<br />AND it supports FDS unlike other ports, But I think FCEUX cut the address logger out,
<br />
<br />We need to see if a new suggestion for a replacement of that address logger, plus a new format based on that logger that will be more readable and stuff...
<br />
<br />Should we do another proposal? It's our decision.

<br />I don't know exactly how capable CDL files are but I wouldn't even think about doing this in any other other way than using emulator logs.
<br />
<br />What are the address logs like? I can't find any info about FCEU ABS. I will consider adding support for that (as well as "CDL") in Nintendulator if you let me know what you need.

<br />the Address Use Log (.AUL) format is described in fceuabs.txt which is inside <a href="http://beneficii.net/smb2/fceuabs.rar" class="postlink">this zip</a>.  if you want to incorporate something like this into nintendulator or come up with a different format that would be cool
<br />
<br />the Code/Data Log (CDL) format is described in a post above and <a href="http://fceux.com/web/fceux-2.0.2.htm?%7B05FC9F4A-AB26-4164-A5F8-6824A3353760%7D.htm" class="postlink">also here</a>
