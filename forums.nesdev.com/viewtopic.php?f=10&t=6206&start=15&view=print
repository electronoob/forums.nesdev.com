<br />2 more issues:

<br />I guess best is to compress grafic with tokumaru compressor,

<br />2.Even it's should be a VRC6,when loaded into Nintendulator,it say it's UNROM...(I changed mapper number to 24)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Are you sure you want to use CHR-RAM? With UNROM you didn't have a choice, but with VRC6 you can use CHR-ROM. The pattern table area is divided into 8 1KB slots, so it's highly customizable.
<br />
<br />If you decide to use CHR-ROM just put the uncompressed tiles at the end of the ROM, and indicate in the iNES header how many banks of it are there. Then you can use the 8 "CHR Select" registers to define what tiles should be mapped to each of the 8 banks (and this is something you can freely change). It's the simplest way.
<br />
<br />If you decide to keep using CHR-RAM, compressing it is a good idea, but you don't have to. My compressor comes with the source code of the decompression routine, that you can include in your projects (but you'd probably have to fix a few syntax issues, as it was written for ASM6). I don't know if I can recommend my compression format, since the decompression is kinda slow. Have you looked into <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=6185" class="postlink">ACK</a> yet?
<br />
<br />Anyway, the complex thing about CHR-RAM is that since the graphics are stored in PRG-ROM, you have to go through all of that trampoline shit in order to select the bank where the graphics are, decompress them and go back to the previous bank. With CHR-ROM you don't have to worry about any of that.

CHR banks are added at the end, they don't replace anything. From what I've seen of NESASM code, you have to add a new bank (bank 16) and put your graphics in it.
<br />
<br />If you need more than 8KB of CHR just keep adding banks (and updating the header). But be sure to always double the number of banks (go from 1 to 2, from 2 to 4, from 4 to 8, etc), or emulators will complain.

<br />Wiki don't say how excatly to change banks and what's limitations about it.

<br />If yes,then I screwed something.
<br />Also how flexibly it can be?
<br />Wiki mentions "PRG Select",but don't explains what it is.
<br />And finally...<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> Maybe you could even take advantage of the fact that this mapper has two slots for switchable banks and actually have 2 switchable banks </div>
<br />Can you explain it a liitle more?Is this mean that i can use 3 banks at once?(1 Fixed +2 switchable)if yes then i'd like to have 1 switchable to handle music code,that would be great <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle">Denine wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I guess that I need to write 7th bit into (for example)$D003 to change CHR ROM to 3rd chr bank?</div><br />I don't know what you mean by "7th bit". From what I understood, just write a byte to each CHR Select register to select which 1KB bank is mapped at each slot. Write $04 to $D001 and the 5th KB of your CHR data will be seen at $0400-$07FF, it's that simple. Since these registers use 1 byte for indexing banks, you are limited to 256KB or CHR-ROM.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also how flexibly it can be?</div><br />By "flexible" I meant that since the slots are so small, you can make a lot of combinations with the CHR banks. Games that use large slots (4KB for example) usually have to replicate a lot of tiles across different banks, but since your slots are very small you can just combine them instead of replicating data.<br /><br />Another thing that is related to flexibility is the option to quickly animate tiles. You can use one of the slots for background tiles that animate, so you can have conveyor belts moving, cogs rotating, and all sorts of dynamic background elements with little effort. You can also dynamically select a different CHR bank for you main character every frame, so you can give him more animation frames than would be possible if you had to keep all tiles loaded at all times.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Can you explain it a liitle more?Is this mean that i can use 3 banks at once?(1 Fixed +2 switchable)</div><br />Yeah, it appears to be like this. One of the slots is 16KB (map a bank to it by writing to $8000), while the other is 8KB (map a bank to it by writing to $C000), so you have to take that into account when making the banks that get get mapped to each of these slots.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">if yes then i'd like to have 1 switchable to handle music code,that would be great <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>
<br />Usually, games just need the music routine once per frame, so it's a good idea to keep the music code separated from the rest of the game engine, so that it doesn't occupy any precious space. Unless the songs use DPCM, in which case you have to worry about keeping the samples always mapped. If you don't use DPCM, you are free to use the banks more freely... You could for example use the 16KB for code and the 8KB slot for data, so you wouldn't have to do the trampoline thing, you'd just select the bank with the data you wanted and read it.
