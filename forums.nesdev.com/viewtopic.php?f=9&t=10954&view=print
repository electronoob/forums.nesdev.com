		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a Twin Fami coming in the mail soon, and while I mod it for the NESRGB, I also plan to change out the power jack so I can use a model 1 Sega Genesis/SMS power supply. When I had a Turbo Twin Fami, I actually added such a power jack and it worked just fine using that particular PSU. However, what I'd really like to know is if doing such a thing on the original Twin Fami will be detrimental over time, or if the Twin Fami will be fine and dandy using a 9-10V PSU.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oookay, so using a 10V PSU on a Twin Fami with an NESRGB installed wasn't necessarily a good idea. While playing Zelda on the FDS after 40 minutes or so, the screen started flickering and the disk drive started moving (!) even when unprompted to do so. The heat sink for the 2SB941 power transistor also got blistering hot so it wasn't exactly happy with 10V. <br /><br />I've now ordered a good regulated universal PSU that outputs 7.5V so hopefully I won't have this problem again.

(Or it broke due to some other past abuse.)

Even having the cartridge mode selected does nothing.<br /><br />EDIT: Did a little poking around and I think I've narrowed it down to the culprits. I'm thinking one of the logic chips on the power PCB (there's a 4001 and 4013) has failed or it could also be the 2C33. Thoughts?

All I know at this point is that the 2C33 commands the disk drive, which is why I'm listing it as a possible suspect. Really hoping that's not the case considering I'd have to cannibalize an FDS RAM adapter for one.

Here's a picture along with another pic of the underside of the board:<br /><br /><img src="http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b144/ApolloBoy/NES/DSCN1066_zps787250ca.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b144/ApolloBoy/NES/DSCN1067_zpsa4cf5e55.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />For some strange reason these chips are entirely omitted on the Turbo Twin Fami's power PCB, they're only present in the original Twin Fami.<br /><br />EDIT: I've tried tracing out the power circuitry and it seems as though Sharp's engineers must've been taking some fairly strong drugs. Seems pretty overcomplicated for something that only puts out 5V.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, I have no idea exactly what the NOR gates in the 4001, or the D latches in the 4013 are doing... mainly because I don't know what signals are on the cables going into the board.<br /><br />Interestingly, this guy's Twin Famicom doesn't have the same board as yours: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://retrostuff.org/2012/12/23/disassembling-the-sharp-turbo-twin-famicom/">http://retrostuff.org/2012/12/23/disass ... n-famicom/</a><!-- m --><br />Between that and this: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://famicomworld.com/workshop/tech/fds-power-board-modifications/">http://famicomworld.com/workshop/tech/f ... fications/</a><!-- m --> I bet your Twin Famicom has protection against rewriting the entire disk. I bet you could bypass them altogether...<br /><br />Anyway, the signal that controls whether the drive spins doesn't look like it goes through the 4013 and 4025 in the ordinary Famicom FMD-POWER boards. So this seems more likely to be something fried in the 2C33? Given the schematic, the value written to the least significant bit of $4025 specifies whether the motor should be on or not. BUT if that's the only thing that's broken (not that I'd be certain it is), this is fixable by adding a little bit of hardware to reimplement the same functionality (four 74xx family ICs, I think). Do you have a logic tester or LED and a big resistor? It shouldn't be too hard to find out whether the FDS BIOS is successfully telling the 2C33 to drive that line high/low.<br /><br />That said, there's also the PCB attached to the drive itself, with the FD3206P or FD7201P IC drive controller. It's possible that's screwing things up also (but once again, no schematic, so I don't know)
