		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Would it be possible to solder a 72 pin connector from a Game Genie to the NES side of a NES Joint board, and plug it into a Famicom (without the female to female 60 pin part, of course) and use it as an adapter to play NES carts on the FC? Or am I just nuts? I've got a broke down Genie, and could easily grab up another Joint, but I thought I would ask first.

Does it mean WorldRunner won't run? Rad Racer won't race?</div><br /><br />I presume they mean 4screen mirroring.  I've got one, seems to work well enough.<br /><br />But yes the adapter already (worthlessly) has CHR /A13 and CIRAM /CE tied together.  Additionally it has sound in and out tied together.  So if you had a NES cart with expansion sound, this adapter drops that sound when trying to run on the famicom.  This makes a little more sense though, since you can't rely on the NES cart to resolve the connectoring like they *could* have for mirroring.<br /><br />If you're already looking at doing that much hacking around with a game genie, modding this to work with 4screen mirroring and full sound would be cake.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I never noticed that notice. I'm not sure what that means. Rad Racer and 3-D World Runner both function fine (via powerpak) with this thing. <s>I have yet to find a game that doesn&#39;t function fine on the Famicom through it, though my testing hasn&#39;t been extensive.</s>Edit: As infiniteneslives pointed out, 4-screen mirroring is not supported, meaning Rad Racer 2 and few other games won't work. It's pretty good for the majority of games, though.<br /><br />Do any NES games require the system clock pin not available on Famicom?<br /><br />Maybe the &quot;3D function&quot; is the Power Glove? I dunno. Maybe it's a mistranslation.

When did you get yours?  Mine is only about 4months old.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ahh, so Rad Racer 2 won't work (requiring 4-screen mirroring), and I guess Gauntlet. This could be fixed with a relatively simple modding, though.<br /><br />Also, if you want to use the exp pin audio mod, you can easily mod your adapter just like you modded your NES (even more easily since you don't have to take anything apart).<br /><br />Edit: infiniteneslives, I do have issues with 4-screen games and this adapter. I had just never tried one on it before tonight, since there's so few of them and they're not exactly favourites.
