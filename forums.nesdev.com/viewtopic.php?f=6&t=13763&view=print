		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm quite happy with the accuracy of my NSF player by now, so I've started looking for ways to (optionally) fudge things to improve sound quality beyond actual hardware. So far I've tried four different hacks, with varying degrees of success:<br /><br /><strong>N163 overclocking</strong><br />The obvious brute-force solution to the ringing and aliasing this chip produces. Examples: any N163 game. Downsides: none.<br /><br /><strong>Halt APU triangle on periods 0 and 1</strong><br />Gets rid of the popping sound when the triangle is &quot;muted&quot; by setting it to an ultrasonic frequency. Examples: <em>Mega Man 2</em>. Downsides: none.<br /><br /><strong>APU pulse DC removal</strong><br />Reduces the crackle that occurs whenever a pulse channel's level changes. Examples: <em>Kid Icarus</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, <em>Dr. Mario</em>.<br />Downsides: causes a low-frequency buzz on some tunes (<em>Mega Man 2</em> NSF track 13, <em>Dr. Mario</em> NSF track 12). Probably a bug in my implementation, though I can't seem to figure out where.<br /><br /><strong>APU pulse linear mixing</strong><br />Fixes the crossmodulation artifacts on some games - mostly FDS titles, for some reason. Examples: <em>Kid Icarus</em>, <em>Doki Doki Panic</em>.<br />Downsides: alters balance slightly, and some games seem to do it on purpose, like the metallic pings in <em>Solstice</em>.<br /><br />Does anyone have anything else to add to the list?

The third amplitude modulation sample sounds rather thin though.<br /><br />I suppose that just proves my implementation is indeed buggy and explains that suspicously 60hz-sounding buzz on some tracks. It does reduce the crackle, though, so it's not a total failure.

I don't know how common it is to silence the triangle with period $000 (the Follin engine does it as well, not only the first two Mega Man games), but $7FF is definitely less common.

A DPCM sample length that goes past $FFFF wraps back around to $8000. <em>( edit: Sorry, slip of the memory. Corrected by TheFox below. )</em><br /><br />I'm not sure what value there is in &quot;cheating&quot; these.<br /><br />What exactly would a cheating DPCM address to? There's nowhere for the address to go past the end of memory, so I don't see any reason to do anything but the wrapping that the hardware actually does.<br /><br />Similarly, all you'd get from &quot;fixing&quot; the VRC6 sawtooth is the ability to make it extra loud. (Extremely overpowered, really.) It would also break anything that relies on the wrap to produce different waveform timbres (Konami games don't do this, but modern NSFs might). I don't think anyone's out there saying the VRC6 sawtooth isn't loud enough?

Castlevania III, for example.<br /><br />My click removal is to detect if $4011 is ever written; if so, I maintain an inverse signal that is mixed on top to cancel it out (i.e. the result of the $4011 write steps up the waveform +35, then my &quot;inverse&quot; jumps down -35). Over time I allow the inverted signal to slowly and noiselessly drain out back to 0 (which is important because clicks are often in 1 direction only, and could eventually cause integer overflow).
