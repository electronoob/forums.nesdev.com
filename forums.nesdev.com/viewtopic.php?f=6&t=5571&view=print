		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I would like to know what is the average size in general for the music engine that have been seen either for commercial games or that people developed by themselves? And in the size, not just the code but any LUT and pre-generated data that they may have required to make it work.
<br />
<br />Simple question but maybe difficult to answer.  I'm sure Neil can give his comment about is current Ninju and people that did their own sound engine like Bregalad, Celius, Tepples too.  I have no knowledge about NSF ripping but maybe rippers knows about the size of the commercial ones.
<br />
<br />Any information on the subject will be appreciated.

<br />
<br />The latest FT driver is easily 4.2k because of the all the new effects.  I'm trimming it to remove what I don't need for my mm9 project. I'm down to 3.6k and still trimming.  
<br />
<br />I just want to know if it's was common for commercial games to have big driver or not.  I guess it all depends on the features of the driver.

<br />
<br />That's the only sound engine I know about in great detail, so I can't comment on averages.

<br />A sound driver in a more complex (i.e. bigger) game will tend to have more features because they fit. Compare the music of Binary Land to that of Kirby's Adventure or Silver Surfer.

<br />As my game is 32kb so I don't want to waste a lot of music. It's possible to come with a very small driver, that only fetches data and write stuff to registers, and then come with a customizable effect system, so that you waste as much size as you want for the extra effect (like vibratoes, software pitch slides, arpeggio, etc...)

You can use this to get an accurate readout of your desired data this way(Bytes Logged As Code), though, this only accounts for code actually used, not likely the error-recovery code, or branches not used due to no sound effect usage.
<br />
<br />I suggest FCEUX because it works with the speedup button. If you're willing to wait, then you can use my copy of FCEUXDSP, which is pre-built and on my page.

This is just the code, the lookup tables, and blank placeholders for the data (so it'll compile <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />).
<br />
<br />My music data is a little bulky though, each note being two bytes (pitch, duration). That and I still would need to add a few commands to allow less redundancy in the music data. On the plus side, it's easy to code the music in hex! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />The 16k limit mentioned before..  That's quite small so if you want to add a lot of music... If you have to be quite creative on the coding/data format side.

Though it does seem to perform pretty fast and be fairly flexible. Music data should be very small, though sometimes it's hard to determine sizes for certain sounds since some are defined with code rather than just bytes (they are still considered data even though they are made of 6502 instructions though). It is kind of impossible for me to determine now the exact sizes of music, as I am still in the engine making stage of game design; I'm saving data creation for the end.
