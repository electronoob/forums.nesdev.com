Sorry, I wasn't aware that I <strong>could </strong>change a post title. If I was, i would have added it to the older thread as an edit to the first post and changed the thread title, but I thought that function was a restricted privilege. Now I see that I can do this if I edit my <em>original post</em>. D'oh.<br /><br />You can post-merge if you feel it is warranted, although the older thread is kind of meaningless now, as this supersedes it. <br /><br />I hope that autorouting is an option, but if 'tisn't, then so be it. Te developer board isn't that difficult to mask, but I hoped that an intelligent autorouter may find ways to conserve space (and layers), especially for the final product.<br /><br />@ Tepples: I presume that you mean FC-&gt;NES game adapters. The PCBs are easy, but the cases are another matter. I have a friend that does plastic work, but she isn't in good health and things are progressing slowly because of it.<br /><br />I am also hoping that she can knock out some replacement Nintendo Robot parts (claws/hands, stack-up blocks, etc.) for me.<br /><br />I was actually planning on making NES-&gt; FC (72F-&gt;60m) adapters for PowerPak owners, as the company that made the ones that I have destroyed the moulds for the cases and has no more PCBs. (Stupid, I know...) <br /><br />The nice thing is that the PCBs actually route the connections in reverse, so that the cart faces the front rather than label-backwards, as is the case with the Family Adapter. Aren't FC-&gt;NES (60F-&gt;72M) adapters included with some of the clone systems? If so, and if they have all of the requisite connections, I could import and modify them, or at least buy the casing for them and produce my own PCBs.<br /><br />I was also thinking of making a bare PCB layout for the FDS RAM-Adapter as a NES cart and making some NES carts with the RAM-Adapter components and cable so that people can use the FDS on NES 'Toaster' consoles, with no special adapters or cartridge slot extension boards. I will also make some NES-&gt;FC and FC-&gt;NES controller cable converters at some point. I have the correct DA-15 ports now. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Is there a source for the male NES controller connectors? I can get the female sockets, but I'm not sure about the other side, except by robbing them from existing hardware.<br /><br />-Xious<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Sun Sep 05, 2010 5:40 am</p><hr />

Xious: I use Proteus by Labcenter.  The base version I bought cost me $250 and is limited to 500 device pins (not counting vias), but that's been enough so far.  It does include an autorouter, but I wouldn't hope to get anything really great out of any autorouter (I guess there are better/more expensive ones, I've never seen a free one).  I use the autorouter just to see if my parts placement is good or not.  99% of the time I undo the results.  Since it won't touch manual tracks, you can nudge it in the right direction, or just use it to get some ideas.  That's method I used to make <a href="http://www.parodius.com/~memblers/nes/squeedo/pics/yellow.jpg" class="postlink">this board</a>, which is probably overkill with it's density and pervasive grounding.<br /><br />Lets try to keep most of this in one thread.  Since you made the first post I think you can edit it to change the subject title, if you want to later.<br /><br />tepples: Yeah, for sound processing you will definitely get much more "bang for your buck" by using an MCU.  Especially if you want memory for samples.

Hi all,<br /><br />I made the presumption that you'd all been following our progress on this project...<br /><br />For those who have not, you can view more info on the NESpander Dev and other projects <a href="http://atariusa.com/NESdev_Projects.html" class="postlink">here</a>.<br /><br />I have another very good engineer working with me at present, and we're waiting for confirmation of a third to come aboard. Once all our ducks are in a row, we'll talk about it more openly (the final NESpander (TM), that is). <br /><br />The NESpander Dev (TM) is--as the name implies--a<em> developer board</em> for the NESpander, which is a NES expansion device, or possible set of devices (EXP port and cartridge bay).<br /><br />The key features of NESpander DEV ARE:<br /><br />Easy access to the functions of the 48-pin NES expansion port via modular groupings of Molex, straight lead and right-angle connectors, plus the full DA-15 expansion connector for Famicom peripherals.  <br /><br />The prototype in the above photos is my second one (Rev. 0B). The nest one will be a full PCB and I am already doing some work on this. I'm using KICAD now, but if anybody can suggest something better (that does excellent autorouting for multi-layer PCBs), I'd appreciate it. <br /><br />The NESpander Dev targets two audiences: People who wish to make deices that utilize the NES expansion port; and of course, people who want to use Famicom devices on their NES or want to use FC extra audio without modifying the NES itself.<br /><br />That's right... The NESpander Dev will automatically enable extra audio for both the PowerPak and normal Famicom and FDS games with extra audio. The current plan for the final NESpander is much grander, with specialized FM audio and possibly sub-mapper support for expanded memory addressing (using onboard RAM).<br /><br />I hope to have finished NESpander Dev boards ready to sell by the end of September or Mid-October, but the final NESpander will take a while to design. <br /><br />I may also make some NESpander Light (TM) units that only add extra audio and the FC port, but none of the other ports, for those with simpler needs, but these will only be available until the final NESpander is ready to manufacture and on an as-ordered basis. (They'll use the NESpander Dev PCB, but without all the ports soldered to it.)<br /><br />In regards to product naming, I think that NESpander easily identifies the card as an expansion device for the NES. 'NExpander', as suggested, doesn't do the job, and instead conjures memories of the Generation NEX system. It's also catchy and easy to remember.<br /><br />I will hopefully be able to make a short video of the device in operation soon just to show it in action, but being a hand-made prototype, the less fiddling I have to do with it, the better. <br /><br />-Xious<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Fri Sep 03, 2010 12:13 pm</p><hr />

48 pins, means it's used to interface the Expansion Port? Just a guess. Would lend itself nicely to the name NESpander (NES Expander). I'd call it the NExpander though, but that's just me. Also: invest in a PCB once you're out of alpha. Makes testing so much easier.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4535">jarek</a> — Wed Sep 01, 2010 10:29 pm</p><hr />
