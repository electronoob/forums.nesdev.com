		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I've made a pretty effective background collision system (probably not very pretty, but suiting my needs for the time being) designed for a single screen, however now I'd like to set up a pointer like I did with nametables, so when I change screens, I also change collision tables along with it.<br /><br />I understand my load loops and whatnot for my nametables.  The difference here is, there is a very particular place to write nametable data.  What would be the best-practice method as far as where to write collision data if it is being store separately from nametable data?  I could do some trial and error stuff and likely get it *working*, but I'd rather know the best practice for this (or at least *good* practice for this) so as to try to avoid landmines later on.<br /><br />I hope that makes sense.<br /><br />Thanks!

I was just wondering if there was a best practice for this or a more logical place (or good place) to store them to CPU memory.  Again, maybe this is a case of overthinking things, but just wondering if anyone had any advice on this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Your collision table is really specific to your game. There is no best practice. Every game needs something different from this.<br /><br />A game could even read back the nametable over the PPU bus during vblank to get its collision info, but this is a rather advanced and also limited technique.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's sort of what I thought. <br /><br />I set up a collision table to handle screen00 and got it working exactly as I wanted to.  <br /><br />Now, with my screen changes (working, using a nametable pointer to load the next screen), I also want to change the collision table (so I'm attempting to set up a collisionPointer that will work parallel).<br /><br />The values are simple hex values (right now, either #$01, #$02, or #$03).  This is what I've done to set up the table.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br />;; there is a variable called tileInfo<br />;; CollisionPointers contains the various data tables,<br />;;named CollisionDataTable01, CollisionDataTable02..etc...<br /><br />LoadCollisionTable:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LDA newScreen&nbsp; ;;right now, this is loading #$05<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; TAX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LDA CollisionPointers, X&nbsp; ;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; STA tileInfo<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LDX #$FF<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LDY #$00<br /><br />LoadCollisionLoop:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; STA tileInfo,y<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; INY<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; DEX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; BNE LoadCollisionLoop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; RTS<br /><br /></div><br /><br />So now, I should be able to get the tileInfo using my method by using LDA tileInfo,y, correct?<br /><br />Again, I know the codes for the collision are working fine...when it was just a single table rather than a pointer, everything worked ok.  Now, things are funky.  <br /><br />See any glaring reason that might be based on the above?<br /><br />Thanks

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />On the 6502, you have a 16-bit address space. This means that pointers to that space are 2 bytes in size. Your &quot;CollisionPointers&quot; array needs to store 2-byte addresses, and you've only loaded a single byte from it.<br /><br />That's the first mistake.<br /><br />The second mistake is STA tileInfo, Y.<br /><br />As I just mentioned, tileInfo should be the address of a 2-byte pointer, not a single byte, but beyond that problem, STA tileInfo, Y does not follow the pointer. STA tileInfo, Y will store at tileInfo itself, which will overwrite your pointer, and then the data after it as Y continues to increment.<br /><br />You want: STA (tileInfo), Y<br /><br />This looks up the address pointed to by the 2-byte pointer data stored at tileInfo, then adds Y to it, then stores A there.<br /><br />Read this: <a href="http://www.obelisk.demon.co.uk/6502/addressing.html" class="postlink">http://www.obelisk.demon.co.uk/6502/addressing.html</a><br /><br />Refer to that page whenever you forget. Eventually you will remember it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Collision data is quite different from name table data, so you shouldn't get too hung up on treating them similarly. Name tables are often read in their entirety and copied to specific locations in video RAM because that's where the NES expects them to be so they can be rendered to the screen. Collision data on the other hand is a part of your game's engine, it's meaningful only to the game logic you're programming, so the NES couldn't care less about how or where it's stored. Unless it's compressed or it can be modified during gameplay (e.g. blocks can be destroyed), there's no point in copying it anywhere, you can access it using pointers and indexes formed with math formulas applied to pixel coordinates directly from PRG-ROM.
