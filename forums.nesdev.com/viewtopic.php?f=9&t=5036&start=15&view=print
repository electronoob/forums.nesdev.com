On top of that, a farmed PCB is the only way to go due to the amount of fine pitch surface-mount stuff there is (with no DIP replacements).  There's also the need for a JTAG programmer for the CPLD (which is from Cypress, BTW).
<br />
<br />In total, to make a single UNES would cost say... $500+ give or take.
<br />I'm making 10 to get the cost down - but then what?  They'll be worth in excess of $250 a piece (NES not included).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So back on topic, what makes it so expensive beyond the large PCB?
<br />
<br />Your bus switches look non-standard/expensive just from the package, thought of using '244/'245 or the CPLD itself for isolation? It appears to have enough I/O...
<br />
<br />Are the ROMs programmed in parallel or using EXTEST like FunkyFlash?
<br />
<br />Are you using the power supply for SRAM retention instead of battery backup?
<br />
<br />Personally I really dislike FTDI chips since for me the most useful application is the asynchronous bit-bang mode. If I wanted to interface my hardware using an MCU, I'd probably get a USB MCU and drop the expensive FTDI...

<br />The $500 dollars is including costs like the JTAG programmer for the CPLD (the devkit was $100), plus the touch fee for the PCB ($400), etc.  The power supply is actually to power the NES and the UNES (it was part of the requirements for school, as well, I didn't feel too comfortable adding so much load to the NES's 7805).
<br />
<br />----Biggest Expenses----
<br />CPLD: Cypress CY37192 -&gt; $30 (Any cheaper 5v CPLD's with that much I/O out there?)
<br />MCU: PIC18F8520 -&gt; $8.50
<br />Bus Switches: 4xSN74CBT16211A &amp; SN74CBT16245 -&gt; $9
<br />16x4 Display -&gt; $15
<br />RAM: 2 x CY7C199D -&gt; $5
<br />ROM: 2 x SST39SF040 -&gt; $5
<br />PCB -&gt; $110 (After touch fee and an order of 10)
<br />Passives, RS232 circuitry, power supply circuitry, SD card circuitry, buttons, knobs, etc. -&gt; $23
<br />The total here on my BOM is $205.76
<br />
<br />The bus switches serve 2 purposes:
<br />1) To isolate the ROM from the NES during programming (and I tried using the CPLD for isolation, but there isn't enough I/O) (These aren't actually implemented in the prototype)
<br />2) To allow the MCU to access both the ROM in parallel with less I/O (The ones you saw)
<br />
<br />At my school there is a CNC Milling Machine which allows us to route double sided PCBs for free - so any surface mount part you see on the prototype is soldered onto one of those 'adapter boards' that I've made.

<br />
<br />I also used a 3.3v CPLD by Altera that can accept 5v signals, so its impossible to break it. I didn't know Cypress made CPLDs.
<br />
<br />I used OurPcb for the boards too, they were way more reasonable. That sounds like your biggest expense!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't see why you need so many CPLD I/O when it appears to be strictly for mapper emulation. I counted necessary signals and think you should be able to get away with a PLCC84/TQFP100 easily:
<br />
<br />15 cpu a
<br />8 cpu d
<br />1 romsel
<br />1 phi2
<br />1 rw
<br />1 irq
<br />
<br />14 ppu a
<br />1 ppu na13
<br />(+8 ppu d for MMC5 though it's not fitting into any CPLD)
<br />1 vram ce
<br />1 vram a10
<br />(+2 ppu rd &amp; wr for MMC5)
<br />
<br />6 cpu rom/ram a output (+1 for NSF bankswitching)
<br />9 ppu rom/ram a output (+3 for MMC5)
<br />4 rom/ram ce
<br />
<br />--------------------
<br />
<br />63 I/O
<br />
<br />Also it's true you don't really *need* 5V outputs as the CPU/memories are TTL compatible (Vih is 2V) and you're not driving any 4000 series CMOS inputs.
<br />
<br />If you plan on implementing some larger NES mappers like FME7, RAMBO1 etc, I don't think even if they reused registers they could all fit into a *300* macrocell design simultaneously. So, if you want to support them, you're probably going to have to keep reprogramming the CPLD. Any given NES (and FC!) mapper (except MMC5, MMC5-like pirates, sound chips etc) by itself will fit into around 120 macrocells though so if you wanted to, you could definitely find a cheaper CPLD! I'd recommend a $6 Xilinx XC95144XL, that way your design can have a little overhead.

<br />
<br />If you want to use the FTDI chip for USB, you can defiantly place it on Bus1
<br />
<br />As kyuusaku mentioned, the CPLD can probably be reduced. You can actually use a 3.3v CPLD with 5v compatible inputs. It wont get fried by the 5v and you won't have to change the rest of the circuit
<br />
<br />I don't think CPLDs should be reprogrammed in the field, some of them only last a few 100 times

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks.  Granted, when I began this project a year and a half ago, I knew absolutely nothing about nintendo hardware.  The first half a year was purely research, more or less.
<br />
<br />When I chose the PLD, I was really aiming for something I knew would be too big - especially because I didn't know how big I was actually going to need it.  Now in hindsight it's definitely the first thing to change.
<br />
<br />I found a part that would be useful here: GTL2000 (seems like an odd part number to me) but it's a 22-bit voltage translator.  2 of these could replace the bus switches at the NES end, and I could switch the entire rest of the circuit to 3.3v - which would reduce cost in nearly every way.  I could also use an MCU with built-in USB (or FTDI, more expensive though).
<br />
<br />cybertron, how would you handle the CPLD programming?

<br />
<br />For the 245s:
<br />
<br />cpu_245_dir = cpu_rw
<br />cpu_245_en = !(!(mcu_cpu_en &amp; phi2))
<br />ppu_245_dir = ppu_!wr

<br />
<br />Altera and Xilinx can export JTAG commands in a binary form that can be played back by a microcontroller to configure the part. This would also eliminate the need for a separate programmer. You could do this to switch board types easily, but make sure the CPLD can endure that many re-writes
