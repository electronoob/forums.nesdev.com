I like the distinction between audio state that can affect long-term emulation and that which can't. As tepples noted, the length counters can also affect CPU operation since they affect what is read out of $4015.<br /><br />The square phase ranges from 0 to 7, not 0 to 15 (I have just re-verified that the square timer itself is reloaded with raw_period * 2 + 2, as documented on the NesDev Wiki).<br /><br />The APU frame counter operation is significantly more complex than is currently documented. I haven't finished the second round of APU reverse-engineering I started many months ago (it got put on hold). I should prioritize on aspects of the APU that affect the CPU. To give you an idea of what I mean, here is a small bit of its exact operation:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Cycles since write to $4017 on even internal APU clock (on odd clock, everything occurs one clock later):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">29830<br />        Perform CPU read/write<br />        Set frame interrupt flag if $4017 = $00<br />29831<br />        Perform CPU read<br />        Perform CPU write to $4008<br />        Clock linear<br />        Clock length<br />        Perform other CPU writes except length counter reload &#40;ignored&#41;<br />        Set frame interrupt flag if $4017 = $00<br />29832<br />        Perform CPU read/write<br />        Set frame interrupt flag if $4017 = $00<br />29833<br /></div><br /><br />As shown, the frame irq flag is set three times (so that if you read it at 29831, it will be set again and still set at 29832 and beyond). Also, a write to a length counter reload register at 29831 is completely ignored; the length counter is never reloaded.<br /></div><br /><br />Ignore the following minor quibbles if you like <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />With the header having a count of the blocks in the file, it requires rewriting after writing blocks (or knowing in advance how many blocks there will be). If you don't like treating EOF as the end of blocks, you could require an explicit "end of file" block at the end.<br /><br />For some reason I think it's a good idea to put large arrays in separate blocks, for example low memory in its own block with nothing else. Also regarding arrays, I don't like their size being determined by the size of the block. Why not store the size of the array just before the elements?<br /><br />I don't like the excessive bit packing in the audio state. I think it would be simpler if it were more relaxed and grouped by channel. Something like<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Square 0<br />   Envelope Reset Flag<br />   Envelope Divider Period Counter<br />   Envelope Volume Counter<br />   Sweep Reset Flag<br />   Sweep Divider Period Counter<br />   Tone Divider Counter<br />   Duty Cycle step &#40;0-15&#41;<br /><br />Square 1 &#40;same&#41;<br /><br />Triangle<br />   Linear Counter Halt Flag<br />   Linear Counter<br />   Tone Divider Counter<br />   Tri-stp &#40;0-31&#41;<br /><br />Noise<br />   Envelope Reset Flag<br />   Envelope Divider Period Counter<br />   Envelope Volume Counter<br />   Tone Divider Counter<br />   RNG Shift Register<br /></div><br /><br />Regarding the noise rng never being zero, a correct emulator would never have zero here, and it's trivial to check this when loading (and use 1 instead).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Thu Jul 21, 2005 10:52 am</p><hr />

Being able to parse a binary file in memory without having to allocate more memory is especially handy in low-memory situations, such as emulators on handheld devices (e.g. PocketNES for Pocket PC or, worse yet, PocketNES for GBA) or emulators that use keyframes (such as anything implementing Sands of Time or emulators that can act as an AVI codec).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Jul 21, 2005 10:33 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />- Is it really necessary to acommodate emus that don't emulate the MMC6 properly? If anyone were to implement the RSNS, perhaps they could fix their MMC6 emulation too.<br /></div><br /><br />I know it seems sloppy, but the problem is due to iNES there's no way to tell whether a game is MMC3 or MMC6 short of CRC checking for a game ID (game specific hacks like that REALLY rub me the wrong way).  For emus which don't CRC check, they'll try and load an MMC3 savestate, but emus which do will load a MMC6 savestate.<br /><br />And personally -- I would argue that CRC checking to bypass the header is the bigger problem here.  Rather than working on ways to make bad headers work, I feel we should be working on making headers right -- and in fact should be forcing bad headers to operate as they dictate (ie: bad header = broken ROM).<br /><br />But that's beside the point -- the method proposed in the state format may not be ideal, but it's a realistic preventative measure, and it only costs 4k of space.  I was even thinking of adding another value to specify the desired offset for that RAM (so that the first 4k wouldn't even have to be saved).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />- "romname.rs#", would that allow romname.rs10 too? Cause I wouldn't want to restrict the no of saves to 10.<br /></div><br /><br />I was keeping SNSS's idea to allow for crippled 8.3 file naming convention.  Although I don't really see the harm in doing something like .rs10 -- since to load that in an emulator which only has 10 savestate slots you'd have to rename it anyway to change the slot number.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />- Would be nice with a block that's reserved for custom data. Some emus may want to save extra data such as statistics, screenshots, timestamps, etc - stuff that isn't essential for emulation.<br /></div><br /><br />I agree completely.  If nothing else this would allow emulators to create a sort of custom format that would at least be mostly supported in other emulators without extra effort on their part.  The personalized blocks could be ignored by emulators which don't recognize them.<br /><br />It couldn't be one custom block for every emu though -- each emulator should have to have their own block ID (or one emu's custom block would conflict with another emu's).  Perhaps we could say custom blocks have to stick with all lowercase letters or something.  Of course custom blocks would have to be optional in whichever emu they're supported (otherwise states from other emulators wouldn't work).<br /><br /><br />Other things that were suggested:<br /><br />- split up MAIN into CPU/PPU/APU sections so that OOP designed emus have an easier time.<br /><br />- rather than forcing the state to be done before NMI/IRQ -- we could just keep a flag to mention if the NMI has been executed or not.<br /><br />- the 'BG Color index' may have been ill advised.  I guess you're just supposed to draw whatever the PPU address is pointing at (if PPU is between $3F00-$3FFF) -- or $3F00 (if PPU address is elsewhere).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Thu Jul 21, 2005 8:58 am</p><hr />

Be brutal if you need, I really want to see something like this polished up.<br /><br />We might have to get in touch with Xod somehow and see if we can get his support on this.  I sure hope Q is willing to come on board as well.  I'll still try and get bbitmaster to work it into the next FCEUXD -- once we have something more complete, that is.<br /><br />One thing about mappers -- do you guys think it'd be a better idea to go with a generic MAPR block like SNSS did?  Or should we do specific blocks for specific mappers (like an MMC1 block, or VRC6 block, etc).  The former prevents an insanely large amount of block types, but the latter allows for easier version revisions of individual mappers as new info arises.  What do you guys think?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Wed Jul 20, 2005 5:30 pm</p><hr />
