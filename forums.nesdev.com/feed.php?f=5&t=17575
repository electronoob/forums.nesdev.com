Because in that case anything in the Gameboy series is also out.<br /><br />I think the Megadrive is also an interesting machine, despite the fact I hardly ever played the real thing - it was very popular here.

PCE is great and all, but it's completely unknown in the region I'm living in.<br /><br />I think it's really paradoxal - the reason why we love Nintendo platforms in the 1st place is because they had so great games, and that it's not a whole mess like the C64 where you had a bunch of pirated and hacked games and nobody could tell where they're from; on the other hand Nintendo being badasses against piracy from day one made sure they had full control over games released on their platform, which in my opinion greatly contributed in what made it so great. Also, I personally disagree they're bastards for shutting down fan Pokémon games. This was clearly an IP violation, with a third party releasing a game usinging a Nintendo branded name, that could make people belive those inferior quality games are from Nintendo. I think it's perfectly normal they shut them down; and if I was releasing a successful game I wouldn't want other people to sell clones using the same brand. Selling clones using another brand would be OK if it's clear it's a &quot;pokémon-like&quot; game and not a Pokémon game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Aug 30, 2018 11:48 pm</p><hr />

At the moment, the Game Boy is probably the by far most popular hardware for new chiptune musicians, thanks to LSDJ (and the sound chip's incredible bass sound). So I really wouldn't worry about finding people who are interested in making music with it. The hard part of course is getting them to do something outside of LSDJ or NanoLoop.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7819">Sumez</a> — Thu Aug 30, 2018 12:36 pm</p><hr />

Usually, you can get the timbre you want out of just two operators, and using more is a sharp slope of diminishing returns, though useful sometimes. You can then use the spare operators for LFO-type effects like hardware accelerated vibrato at the very least. You can even let the carrier be the LFO for an easily approachable scheme. But yeah, there is a reason why providing floppies and ROM cards with premade patches for musicians became a sustainable job for a few with the know-how in the 80:s. (Well in fairness it was harder to acquire the skills then without a degree, too). <br /><br />I have a 2-op fm module with tactile controls in my synth rack just to be able to quickly dial in the timbre i'm looking for, so i then can program that ratio into my less directly approachable 80s synth. That's even easier than memorizing particularily useful ratios, but there's also tested and true approximate ratio tables out there which you can orient yourself from.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Thu Aug 30, 2018 12:07 pm</p><hr />

GB/GBC CPU has its own set of quirks, such as no true indexed addressing mode, though some other things are nicer on that platform. And good luck fitting your game into 32K, as that's how big Catskull's reproduction carts are currently. And it's also Nintendo controlled, though the GB patent is already expired and the GBC patent should expire a couple months from now, and Color Dreams/Wisdom Tree is famous for being the unlicensed NES and GB game publisher that Nintendo never sued.<br /><br />Genesis is both easier and harder. It's easier in that MC68000 assembly is nice and C is practical. But it's harder in that players expect more art: 16-color tiles and sprites, bigger sprites, 2 layers, and line scrolling. There's also 4-operator FM to deal with, and musicians with PSG experience might experience growing pains in switching to that model.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Aug 30, 2018 10:37 am</p><hr />

Exactly my point, so if you aren't going with NES, PCE just feels like the best choice, since it's almost like a superpowered NES. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Of course, I'm a little biased because it's close to being my favourite console (and it should be pretty high on anyone's list, honestly).<br /><br />If you're in a country where the C64 was ever popular though, there's a really strong community still keeping it alive, with a ton of homebrew happening. And like the PCE, it also has a CPU similar to the NES. So if you dig the community stuff, the C64 is a great choice, but I'm not personally a fan of the hardware or its original games library.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7819">Sumez</a> — Thu Aug 30, 2018 8:52 am</p><hr />

Here come you guys and your random retro platform suggestions... These &quot;alternatives&quot; were far less popular than the NES, which means that a lot of people aren't interested in them at all. C64 was popular in the US and Europe, PCE was popular in Japan (and significantly less so in the US I guess), but the rest of the world doesn't really care about those &quot;obscure&quot; machines. If you want to be relevant anywhere, you can't run from Sega and Nintendo.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Aug 30, 2018 8:16 am</p><hr />

Urgh... Like, from the disgustingness of Nintendo being so sopastic, I sometimes have such a revulsion towards anything that's from Nintendo. Like, ANYTHING! Even the NES console. Now, I'm not saying I don't like making stuff for NES. I love this whole adventure about learning about how our good old NES works. But somehow, I think that Nintendo will soon take down all the NES let's plays, all the retro stuff, and after that, they'll just start targetting us for using the word &quot;NES&quot;. I know, it's a slippery slope, but you know what happens when you give a man a little finger; he takes your whole hand! So that's basically what Nintendo is doing. I'm kinda thinking about what if we could modify the NES to the point of eliminating everything that has &quot;Nintendo&quot; text in it or anything remotely. Like, making an FPGA modification, an emulator modification, etc., and stopping using *.NES file extension and instead using something else. Like, seriously! I'm so ready to boycot everything from Nintendo! I'm sick and tired of all of these SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, CISPA, PRISM, TPP, GDPR, Article 13, DMCA, RIAA, etc. fan-phobic assoholism!<br /><br />Now, maybe all of this is just a pointless rant or my subconscious soapboxing. Sorry about that. But really! I just want to wipe away all the risk of us getting destroyed! Considering that most of our adventures are based on something. Like, soccer players don't violate copyright by playing soccer with a soccerball they buy and with the T-shirts they wear when they record themselves playing. So why should we digital people have to suffer from copyright? If in the times of Rennaisance and Baroque there was no copyright protection, why should there be any over here? Or why doesn't someone just create a copyleft open-source EULA that's going to enforce fandom rights and which will indemnify all fan-workers and punish all of those who dare to sue them? Now I'm starting to understand why Linux people are so zealously toxic.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6924">8bitMicroGuy</a> — Wed Aug 29, 2018 8:49 pm</p><hr />
