<br />
<br />Basically I modified the driver as I mentioned to bankswitch Rockman 1 into place and then the driver will continue on to try to dump the game as a TXROM game normally would. I think I did this correctly, try it out and let me know. If it works I'll make 5 more to dump the rest of the games.

<br />Anyway I wanted to ask one thing, since the project of replacing the Game Genie rom with TapeDump is dead (and I have a glob-top GG anyway), I was curious, what about cutting the current for the cartridge slot between cartridge exchanges? I can cut the lines and insert a switch to my Famicom, turn off the power to the cartridge slot when pulling out the TapeDump cart and powering it back on after the dumped cartridge is inserted. Would this work? I'm starting to worry about my Rockman multicart, since I already killed one glob-top pirate with the swap-trick. 
<br />Thanks!

<br />
<br />Even if you did that I still wouldn't consider it "safe" in fact it might be worse.  I'm not certain here but I'm imagining if damage is actually occurring it's because for a split second when pulling the cart you've broke contact with a power pin but some address/data pins are still connected.  And in that situation normal power is removed but there is still the potential to power/ground some ICs through the address/data lines.  and if you did that wonky things will happen and it's conceivable something could be improperly biased and burn out.  I wouldn't think it's very likely but conceivable.
<br />
<br />If my guess is correct you'd actually be making the issue worse by removing the Vcc for a few seconds vice a few milliseconds.   But I'm not certain why your cart broke, it could have been coincidental and not related to hot swapping it, I'm only speculating really.

<br />
<br />infiniteneslives - Thanks for the opinion, I haven't considered the power at A/D lines. My pirate cart that is no longer working was the one in <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7119" class="postlink">this</a>topic. Actually I managed to dump <a href="http://jpx72.detailne.sk/upload/CHINESE.NES" class="postlink">something</a>, but after the sound stopped, I was not able to make this cart work. The console behaves like there's nothing inserted at all.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some more information about the Rockman Multicart. Thanks to jpx72 for dumping the data for me to examine to figure this out. Some bits are speculated until more testing can be done. PRG is probably concrete but CHR is a bit fuzzy. I think the upper nibble of $5010 and $5012 are related to CHR configuration.
<br />
<br />PRG-ROM is a 16 Megabit / 2 Megabyte ROM with data arranged as follows:
<br />Rockman 5 (256K)
<br />Rockman 1 (128K)
<br />Duplicated Rockman 5 Data (120K)
<br />Menu Program (8K)
<br />Rockman 2 (256K)
<br />Rockman 3 (256K)
<br />Rockman 4 (512K)
<br />Rockman 6 (512K)
<br />
<br />CHR-ROM is probably a 4 Megabit / 512 Kilobyte ROM:
<br />Rockman 5 (256K)
<br />Rockman 3 (128K)
<br />Menu CHR (8K)
<br />Duplicated Junk Rockman 5 Data (120K)
<br />
<br />The upper nibble of $5011 most likely sets address lines on the PRG-ROM. The lower nibble of $5010 probably affects the effective size of the PRG viewable to the MMC3, 128K/256K/512K. 
<br />
<br />Upper nibble on $5010 is probably bit 1 set CHR-RAM Enabled, clear CHR-ROM enabled. bit 0 is probably a CHR ROM size 128K/256K switch. 
<br />
<br />The upper nibble on $5012 is probably CHR-ROM address lines. 
<br />
<br />Again I haven't confirmed some of this but I'm pretty sure that most of it should be correct.
<br />
<br />Update:
<br />Retrieved the Menu CHR and confirmed the data ordering.

<br />Or will possible do in Tape Dump manual entering importances? The choice of the banks graphs and code...
<br />
<br />Beside I was got pull out some graphics from my cart. I simply inserted and took out the cart in dendy (famiclon). And if I saw the necessary graphics - I wrote her. But with code so is not got.

Look at Kevtris' homepage ( <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://kevtris.org/nes/pirate.html">http://kevtris.org/nes/pirate.html</a><!-- m --> ).  That's a large part of his NES work: analyzing mappers so that carts can be dumped.
