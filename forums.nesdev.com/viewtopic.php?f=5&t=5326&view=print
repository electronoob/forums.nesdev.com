<br />What platforms are java only ?  I used Java once in school, havent since.  And I cant remember the last time I had it installed.

<br />Programs running inside web browsers are generally JavaScript/Java/Flash only. One needs to be an administrator to install plug-ins written in C++, and if you're trying to install a plug-in into Internet Explorer, it additionally needs to be digitally signed with an Authenticode certificate, which many students and hobbyists cannot easily afford.
<br />
<br />Some cell phones can run midlets, or apps written in Java that use the MIDP API. They can't run C++ programs that aren't approved by the carrier. Apps for Android phones are written in the Java language, but not Java ME or Java SE.

<br />
<br />I was thinking about getting an Andriod, cant that run c / c++ at all ?
<br />
<br />As I said I learn little java a few years back in school.  I wasnt impressed since any java app i have used was slow.  Not only that, it was usually a pain to set up the java runtime; my biggest complaint.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There's also various operating systems (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaOS" class="postlink">JavaOS</a> in particular) and various processors (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/picojava" class="postlink">picojava</a> for one) that use Java for either the base of the operating system or as the basic instruction set architecture of the processor.
<br />
<br />In the last few years, Java has become a lot faster. I don't know when you first used it, but the HotSpot recompiler is MUCH faster than it used to be (and likely orders of magnitude faster than the old interpreter). With the recompiler profiling on the fly, it could probably do better than some compilers (especially if the user doesn't enable any optimizations).
<br />
<br />That said, I still don't like Java. The both the language and the standard library are a pain. The inability to access native code easily, serialization over network, etc. C# is a bit better, but not by much. I had been working on a new language for a while, but organizing a parser became somewhat boring and I got sidetracked. [/url]

<br />You can run native code (compiled from c++ or whatever) in the Android emulator. I have no idea how you would deploy a native app on an actual Android device though, since I've never tried.
