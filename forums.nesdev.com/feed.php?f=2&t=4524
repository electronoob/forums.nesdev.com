Yeah, VirtuaNES is my emulator of choice if the there are people using the TV, and I can't use the NES. To me, it's by far the best emulator in terms of speed, and still keeping updated enough to be worth something. I've been using v.092 though, because my old retrousb controller wouldn't work with v.092, so I never bothered updating.<br /><br />I don't know why Nestopia runs slow on my system, because it didn't use to. I have a 3200+ AMD processor and 512 of RAM, so I don't know what gives. I do know that the accuracy of the games has been surpassing Nintendulator though, as when I was developing Tic-Tac XO, I found a problem with the way I was doing delays back then. I was actually doing a <em>very cruddy</em> way, which I didn't know at the time, where I was constantly waiting for vblanks. Of course vblanks get missed, but the side effect is that even playing music in the NMI causes the tune to drag. This wouldn't happen in Nintendulator, and the only way I found this happening before testing on an NES was through testing in Nestopia.<br /><br />More recently, my minigame compo entry !Clik! has a problem with saving a high score on reset, which apparently has something to do with the way I handled CHR-RAM. This only happened in Nestopia, but then was confirmed on the NES itself from two different people. <br /><br />So, this is why I use Nestopia as my "test before hardware test emulator". It just seems to have surpassed Nintendulator in that respect, though I wish it wouldn't have, because Nintendulator runs so much better on my system.<br /><br />I can't say I ever had any input lag on Nestopia though. It's just an issue of having to set priority on it, for me.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=174">Roth</a> — Sun Nov 02, 2008 2:26 pm</p><hr />

I never had performance issues with Nestopia in any of my PCs, and it is my emulator of choice for playing and testing. Vsync is a must for me and I've never had problems because of it.<br /><br />For debugging, nothing beats FCEUXD. Nintendlator's debugger is very unfriendly, and those hardcoded levels of debugging are a pain... Why can't you pick the individual windows you need like in FCEUXD? So I usually end up using Nintendulator only for testing, because it's accuracy used to be legendary (but I don't even know if this is the case anymore, as Nestopia is getting pretty damn accurate too).<br /><br />When developing, I always keep these 3 emulators open. I use Nestopia the most though, with every build of the game. I use the others occasionally, and to track down bugs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Nov 02, 2008 1:10 pm</p><hr />

Nestopia would be my primary emulator if it didn't exhibit severe input lag in full-screen mode with Vsync enabled. It also seems to have a very obscure input bug that will sometimes cause a button to stick for several frames. IIRC, I found only one mention of it on the forums, and it was pretty much shrugged off... -_-<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=935">BMF54123</a> — Sun Nov 02, 2008 12:55 am</p><hr />

From what I've worked on recently, it seems to me that Nestopia has been becoming the most accurate, but I have to always set it to Above Normal priority just to make it run well on my system :/  So, I usually use Nintendulator for most of my preliminary tests. I also use FCEUXD SP when I need to use a hex viewer while it runs. After I've got it how I want it to run on Nintendulator, I usually test against Nestopia after that, since I tire of setting the priority everytime I boot it up.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=174">Roth</a> — Sat Nov 01, 2008 7:03 pm</p><hr />

It's probably because you're setting the scroll mid-frame. Try first displaying the screen by turning it on in the NMI/Vblank.
