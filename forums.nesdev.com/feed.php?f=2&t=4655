In my game (ChateauLevania, pretty much a ripoff of Castlevania: SOTN but based off of a book I'm writing titled "The Curse of Chateau LeVeaux"), the map is made of rooms, which are collections of screens, which are each 4x4 collections of 8x8 tile metatiles (so they're 256x256 pixels big, but it makes it easier to handle if they're not 256x240).<br /><br />These metatiles are made of 2x2 4x4 tile metatiles, which are made of 2x2 2x2 tile metatiles, which are made of 2x2 single tiles. There are 256 possible different tiles to choose from with 8x8, 4x4, 2x2 and of course 1x1. You can swap these stacks of metatile definitions to have more unique level design.<br /><br />All screens are defined in one bank (16 bytes each, so 16k/16 =1024 unique screens), all rooms are defined in one bank (all are variable size), and all metatiles are defined in one bank (~4k for each stack, so 4 different ones minimum, but they'll be layed out so you can use more than that). That makes my castle map 48k just for the background part, but maybe I'll squeeze the object map into the room part, making the entire map 48k, which I think is decent when I have 512k to work with. If not, then it'll be 64k, which I still think is pretty okay.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Wed Dec 17, 2008 12:48 pm</p><hr />

Then there's always huge meta-meta tiles, like Ultima 6 for the PC.<br />There was the "Map", made up of big 8x8 tile sheets (up to 1024 different ones), and the "chunks", which defined the contents of each 8x8 tile sheet, using up to 256 different tiles.  I think the main map was 128x128 sheets.

It's going to take more than that to define the whole background with RLE (including the blank spaces around that). However, it's going to take 42 bytes to define that whole background with an object based system.<br /><br />The object itself is 33 bytes, and pointing to/placing the object takes 3 bytes. So 3 objects times 3 bytes = 9 + 33 = 42. With just RLE and no layering system, this would take a lot more, depending on the object.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Tue Dec 16, 2008 5:04 pm</p><hr />

I think tepples' point of equivalence only applies when the object-based format's objects are all of like size, placed on a grid with a spacing the same as the object size. If object sizes vary, then decoding wouldn't be able to follow a strict top-to-bottom, left-to-right tile order.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Tue Dec 16, 2008 4:02 pm</p><hr />

I used to be a big fan of object-based encodings, as seen in Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario World.

i have about 16kb worth of space for levels, so optimizations is not really that big of a deal i guess. I have used use the object method before though in this the odds of reusing a block of tiles is very slim. in previous versions that had less tile types, i used the RLE method and got rather small levels.... though with the new tiles i think the 2 tiles per a byte will work better <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25">WhoaMan</a> — Mon Dec 15, 2008 10:08 pm</p><hr />

Well for this type of thing (a one-screen level, I'm assuming), methods I've used have been a bit more extreme (only 2 tile types for a maze) where I had 32 byte levels (each bit represented the absence/presence of a tile). But for your case, I'd probably stick with a system where in one byte there are 2 tiles. This is good because you have a fixed size for a level, and you won't end up wasting bytes or anything like that.<br /><br />But a better system might be an objects system. Define rectangular objects in ROM and place them on the level using coordinates. For example you could have an 8 tile wide horizontal bar of metatiles, and this can be made of any metatiles. Then you do this:<br /><br />.db XPosition, YPosition, ObjectNumber<br /><br />Which would use 3 bytes to place a large object. You could also implement a layering system with this where metatile #0 in each of these blocks represents invisibility, so you can put an object below it which will show up through the "invisible" metatiles. But if that's too complex, I'd stick with the two tiles per byte. How much space are you working with for how many levels?<br /><br />EDIT: Another advantage of the objects system is it works 2 dimensionally, where RLE and stuff works 1-dimensionally. Though these objects might be defined 1 dimensionally....<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Mon Dec 15, 2008 9:56 pm</p><hr />

I am at the stage in my game where i am designing the various data formats and what not. the levels in my game will be for a grid of 14x10 tiles. (there is actually a frame around this grid so it is really 16x12, but the frame is tile type 0 so when i clear the buffer it will take care of this).... anyways, i am trying to decided on storing 16x10 tiles in the format of :<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">76543210<br />XXXXYYYY<br />      XXXX # of times tile repeats<br />      YYYY # tile number to repeat<br /></div><br />with this format, the smallest level size (with the other level information) would be around 12 bytes (not that this would happen as the level would be boring as hell) and no bigger than 100 bytes<br /><br />although, if i store just two tiles per a byte... and have the stored level data be just the 14x10... then i can store each level in ~74 bytes.<br /><br /><br />what methods does everyone typically use? i am leaning towards having each level be the 74 bytes as it should average out.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25">WhoaMan</a> — Mon Dec 15, 2008 9:40 pm</p><hr />
