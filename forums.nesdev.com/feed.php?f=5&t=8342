Of course, one of the problems with using ripped graphics is that some of them might make it into your final product.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Nov 21, 2011 5:10 am</p><hr />

I don't mind ripping graphics for non-commercial hobby projects. In fact I'm planning to do that for my own engine demo, because I have not been able to found a committed graphics artist.<br /><br />I agree with everything Shiru said though, it's surprisingly hard to rip graphics because of different styles and often very good graphics also have some kind of layering/shadowing/etc going on which takes some time to figure out if you want to apply it in to your own levels as well.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=80">thefox</a> — Mon Nov 21, 2011 3:23 am</p><hr />

Not touching the legal stuff, it affects the quality and appeal of the game. First, people will recognize the graphics very fast, and it define their feeling about the game, something like 'a non-serious homebrew'. It especially will happen if you take all the graphics from a single game, some may even consider your game a hack in the result. Second, if you take graphics from different games, you'll end up with the problem of unmatching styles, which easily could give the game unprofessional look even if good pieces of graphics were used.<br /><br />Other thoughts - if you borrow graphics from other game, why not go further? Get music and sounds too, then code, then story.<br /><br />Regarding Dizzy games specifically, there were a lot of fan-made Dizzy games on ZX Spectrum, and for me the best ones back then were those that had at least some new, original graphics - that made them 'fresh' and more interesting.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Sun Nov 20, 2011 7:00 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, like Subject says.<br />After release of MOE0 I'v got a lot comments about grafics upgrade.I really tried to, but I myself can't produce any good grafics.<br />Actually, about month ago I asked Dizzy series community(MOE is definitly Dizzy like game) about the same, and I got lot of "OK, why not" answers.<br />MOE1 is progressing nicely and should be finished in december(25th?).<br />SO why I'm writing this?<br />Actually, originally I was planning to use Dizzy games grafics only.<br />Oliver Twins(Fathers of Dizzy games series)gave OK for such things very long ago(as long as games made with their grafics are not sold).<br />The problem now is that I run out of grafics from dizzy games.<br />I asked few peoples to help me, but no one agreed.<br />For example, I need Library grafics.Why not use Addams Family "Study Room" grafics?<br />I'm not asking about legality thing.<br />I'm asking how do you people feel about such...action(stealing grafics from other games).Do you condemn it? Or don't care about it?<br />Feel free to call me a "bad guy", I don't mind it, really.<br />Thanks for any comments on this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4239">Denine</a> — Sun Nov 20, 2011 6:12 pm</p><hr />
