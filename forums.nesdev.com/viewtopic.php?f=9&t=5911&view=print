		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just bought a Startropics cartridge off of eBay.
<br />It has a weird problem.
<br />
<br />Tiles 28,29,2A,2B,2C,2D,2E and A8,A9,AA,AB,AC,AD,AE on both pattern tables have corrupt left nibbles.  The low 8 bytes of the tile are sometimes okay on font tiles, but on other tiles it's not.  It seems to me like an address line or data line problem triggered by certain addresses.
<br />
<br />Is there anything that can be done about that kind of problem?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Clean it and examine the traces to make sure they haven't been damaged. I got a Ninja Gaiden 3 cartridge once that wouldn't work and somehow a bunch of traces got damaged right where the plastic shell closes on the cartridge edge connector. Simply reconnecting these broken paths fixed the issues it was having which were both PRG and CHR line breaks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had a kirby super star cartridge with similar damage; I SUSPECT it is caused by people stupidly cleaning the cartridge edges with some sort of caustic liquid and not removing all the liquid afterward (usually leaving one or two drops which wicked in between the plastic case and the pcb), and the liquid eats one or more traces it is sitting on top of. A drop of solder to bridge the eaten trace fixed it.

<br />Hmm...
<br />
<br />I haven't played Star Tropics in ages and canâ€™t remember if it's a BBR or a password-based game. If it is battery-backed, you may want to check those circuit paths for damage too, as batteries tend to leak over time, and if all looks OK, pull the battery and replace it. 
<br />
<br />Corrupted BBR could cause issues like this in some instances, as intermittent power can cause corruption in the RAM and address errors can creep in that can corrupt aspects of the game code during play.

<br />I'm sure the board or connections are bad.  I just don't have the screwdriver.

I'd say get the gamebit (will save time in the future), but for now take a lighter to the bottom of a disposable bic pen with the white plastic barrel and blue butt cap (fittingly called the bic trick; usually involves a bic lighter and pen, ironically enough) take the heated end to a gamebit for about 10 seconds, then use that to take the screws out.
