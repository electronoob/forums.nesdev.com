Nostalgia!&quot;</div><br />I get these things all the time -- NES or Famicom carts that have kids' names written on them (often full names).  Like the Rockman 3 cart Zycrow sent me has 佐々文木のり (SASAKI Fuminori) written on it, and I have some NES carts with miscellaneous North American kids' names on them as well.<br /><br />It makes me wonder about the origins and the history -- how did the cart end up in their hands?  Did they buy it? Trade for it?  What those kids' lives were like then? Do they even remember writing their names on the cartridges (wouldn't be surprised if parents did this for obvious reasons)?<br /><br />It'd be interesting to track those people down and just ask them general questions, like 10 minutes of their time, that sorta thing.  I imagine the stories and details vary immensely, but I also bet there are some interesting stories (using myself as an example, although I never wrote my names on cartridges (magazines yes, carts no), I used to have a copy of Dragonfire for the Atari 2600 but lost it in a bet at school with a friend of mine -- I just wish I could remember what the bet was about, because whatever it was, it was enough to make me *never* make bets on anything ever again :P).

(Read Dickens' <em>Great Expectations</em> for an idea of what that must feel like.)<br /><br />For example...<br /><img src="http://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/weekly/FamiStars00.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/weekly/Stars_of_the_Family_Computer.html">http://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/week ... puter.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The girl pictured on this book's cover e-mailed me last year asking her to remove the pictures of her &amp; her brother, even though it was a widely-distributed published book from 1989(!).  I blurred her &amp; her brother's faces and removed all mention of their names, which were also printed in the same book(!)

Did those kids' friends have a habit of borrowing multiple copies of the same game from different people and then mixing them up?<br /><br />Anyway, just MHO.

Did you lend games much as a kid? It's not always easy sorting it out and getting them back! Kids are very unreliable.

I remember he'd always bring the extra awesome NES games over to our house, like Mega Men and Kirby's Adventure.
