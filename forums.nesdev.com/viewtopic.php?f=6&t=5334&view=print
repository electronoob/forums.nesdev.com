		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />About a year ago I wrote a tool that would automatically take a (monaural) audio file and convert it to a series of bytes you could write to the NES noise channel control registers. This is specifically useful for making percussive sounds, and works best on snare drum and high hat samples.<br /><br />I kept on meaning to go and make it less fragile but never got around to it. I figure it'd be better to post it here now, so that either 1- someone else benefits from it 2- someone else inspires me to fix it.<br /><br />There are a few samples inside. You probably are most interested in noise.asm and noise.obj. (I'm using the xa65 assembler, because it's the only one in debian.). The actual converter itself is analyze.pl -- it's verbosely documented, so if you want to rewrite it in a different language you should be ok.<br /><br />How it works:<br />The tool takes a reference set of sounds generatable by the noise hardware, takes their FFTs, and then compares this to the FFTs of a file to be converted, 1/60th of a second of audio at a time, finding the best match. (This is a kind of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granular_synthesis" class="postlink">granular synthesis</a>)<br /><s>Caveats:<br />* This tool needs perl, PDL, and PDL::Audio.<br />* I wrote it on Linux. It might work on windows, but I&#39;ve not even looked at it.<br />* I generated the reference audio using FCEU which I&#39;m certain isn&#39;t very accurate.<br />* The closest-FFT algorithm is the wrong one to choose for the short-loop mode of the noise hardware, so tonal things convert things badly<br />* Conversion is actually simply wrong for converting files not sampled at 48kHz. &#40;it&#39;s a tempo-preserving pitch shift of the file by 48kHz/input rate&#41;<br /><br />Anyway: -h-t-t-p-:-/-/-e-a-m-p-.-o-r-g-/-l-i-/-n-o-i-s-e-g-r-a-i-n-.-7-z- [937kB] It&#39;s only so big because I&#39;m  including the reference noisewaveforms.wav -- generating it involved stupid hackery.</s><br /><br />edit x2: Please use the C version: <div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

<br />Some of them are compellingly close, many are so-so. However, I should fix this problem -- does 7z complain about the files, or something else? (MacOS, Windows, and linux disagree about what marks a newline in a text file -- if it's just the text files that are giving you trouble)

<br />
<br />Don't get me wrong, I think it's a noble effort and if you could make it work with pitch too I'd definitely use it.
<br />
<br />I'm currently writing a NES audio engine (known around these parts as 'Nijuu') and my drum synthesis wavetables use any or all of the NES hardware voices. I recently uploaded an editor I made on the NES itself to enable you to live-preview your sounds;

<br />(apologies for the lack of navigation, scroll down to bottom and work up)
<br />
<br />Re. 7z. That was my fault. Years ago I'd installed some stand-alone (flaky) unzipper for 7z files. I've just thrown it in the bin and unarchived it properly and it's not corrupted any more.
<br />
<br />I've still not heard the sounds yet though - the .NES file won't open in Nestopia (I'm on OSX).

<br />Yep, using multiple voices. I appreciate that that may make it massively more complicated.
<br />
<br />Seems like I'm the only one concerned about this though so don't go out of your way to accommodate me - I'm quite happy using my little editor.

<br />Check out ActivePerl and use the xa65 compile above.  I just ran the MakeFile.PL in the root of PDL and dumped whatever libs from PDL it needed in Perl's /lib directory.
