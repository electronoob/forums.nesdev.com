<br />
<br />The mentioning of NA struck me as rather odd in this sort of discussion, as a secondary feature of what they do is <em>leak prototypes</em>, and unlike others (Hidden Palace, X-Cult, SEGASaturno etc.) they insert their name in the game, which itself is secondary to the point of this thread. 
<br />
<br />Exerion II, U-Force Power Games, Mike Tyson's Intergalactic Power Punch. That's precisely what I'm talking about.
<br />
<br />Maybe I'm derailing this, and in the event that I am, I'd like to apologize to Tepples.
<br />
<br />In an attempt to move away from this tangent; perhaps embedding it into vNES, encrypted, and requiring net-based access would be a reasonable solution to this problem.

<br />I'm looking at this from a completely different aspect. If DreamTR is the one responsible for the generously-named watermarks, then I suppose my issue is more with him than NintendoAGE, and I'm clearly in the wrong for finding fault with NA.

<br />In an effort to convey my thought more clearly, I have the same problem with intros for the same reason. Perhaps it's unreasonable. It's plentiful in the scene, moreso with GBA than NES, but that's just my stance on it, not that anyone particularly cares.

<br />The transposing of the IP address is great. We do this with CC info of customers stored on my work CP (it's a rental store so we need to keep that stuff). Certain numbers are altered specific ways, in a way that is completely arbitrary and impossible to guess.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, secrecy in the industry has always been problematic, but locking the game with a password isn't the best way to handle this... Making sure that if anybody leaks the game, you can sue his or her pants off and that you can prove without a doubt that did so is the key issue here. 
<br />
<br />You shouldnâ€™t make it difficult for testers to actually load the game every time. Trust me, it only serves to irk your alpha &amp; beta stage testers and make them wants to do something else. 
<br />
<br />Is this a NES game? If so, imagine yourself as a tester who has to recall a cryptic passkey and punch it in with a NES controller every time you fire up the game. Games with passwords suck already, but having to use one each time you run the cart is just a horrifying thought. 
<br />
<br />It would probably be best to simply do a custom ROM for each tester and embed his or her name in the code, then sign everybody to an NDA. That way, you can perfectly track each copy and if anybody dumps the ROM, you know who it was and can bust him or her for breach of contract under the NDA. 
<br />
<br />If it is an NES game, I would be willing to both do testing and sign a full NDA. I've done that before for many software titles on various platforms (Commodore, Amiga, Mac, Atari, etc.) in the past when I used to write manuals and reviews. 
<br />
<br />If you need any legal help with writing an NDA, I can send you a template that I use for my own business.

So I don't want one of the beta testers to leak a copy to the public. I already have people in my own family that I can't trust to keep a trade secret.<br /><br />Here's what I plan: For each copy that I hand out to a beta tester, embed the recipient's name in multiple places in the ROM and encrypt important CHR data. If you turn on the game, you get a decoy: some random single-screen puzzle game. But if you hold a specific button and press Reset, you get a password entry screen. Enter the right password to start running the prototype; a wrong password will give either "Denied" or (if the user is lucky) corrupted CHR data.<br /><br />Is there a better way?</div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just noticed this thread. What about using a unique code "stored" in each NES? Each NES has unique values at power up, which are relatively stable (initial SRAM and palette values, for example). Could the program read this, display some sort of code (based on them) on screen for the tester to give back to the developer, and then the developer give the tester a password to use? The idea is that critical sections of game data would be encrypted. The tester wouldn't know his NES's power-up values. Assuming power-up values are relatively unique, he'd have to dump them from his particular NES for his password to be usable on a leaked copy. He could run it on an emulator first, so you could have that alter the displayed code subtly so that you are alerted.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />See I wonder about the effectiveness of these name-embedding methods. If you are filling blank space in the ROM with random numbers, and then hiding a secret encrypted message (the person's name) in there, that can easily be worked around by profiling the ROM in the emulator. I.E., playing the game for a long period of time, and any memory location that doesn't ever get read from or changed would be set to zero, removing all the random data, along with the embedded message. You could always have the ROM read from random locations and then do nothing with that data, but that's not much of an improvement. Your best bet is probably stenography, hide the message in your sprites somehow.
<br />
<br />If you're simply trying to keep non-technical folks from leaking this ROM, though, your idea will probably work fine.

<br />Good news: my cousin is no longer interested in leaking, given that he found an even older version of LJ65 on some ROM site. But really, the only leaks I'm worried about are those that interfere with a publisher's willingness to make repros. Remember how Half-Life 2 got delayed after much of the Source engine got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2#2003_leak" class="postlink">leaked</a>?

<br />Tepples, 
<br />
<br />How exactly do you mean this? An NDA is good not only in every state, but in all countries that affirm US copyright laws 9such as Canada, Japan, the E.U., etc. and should protect you against anybody who tries to leak the game.
<br />
<br />I like your ideas about slightly differing graphics, as this will be harder to track than a name in the code. That is probably the best way to go: any way to hide a tester's name so that they can't find it in the CHR data is ideal.
<br />
<br />Would you like a copy of a solid NDA to use? If so, simply let me know and I'll pull one from my files and type up a template. I used to use Commodore's NDA as my own template for my businesses, as they had great lawyers (and unfortunately, rubbish marketing agents).
<br />
<br />I'd be interested in testing your game, so if you are looking for further Beta-phase testers, please keep me in mind. I can also test your code on Famicom consoles and clones, which may be an added bonus. 
<br />
<br />What mapper are you using?
