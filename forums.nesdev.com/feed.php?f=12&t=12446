Welcome back undisbeliever!<br /><br />For Elevator Madness DX, you press Start to play the game.<br /><br />I can't test these games on real hardware. I have an actual SNES, but no cart capable of playing custom programs. I'm still glad to play with them via emulator, even if briefly.<br /><br />I have successfully made real SNES music for almost half a decade now (since 2009, actually... and I've been using a compiled version of mukunda's SNESMod since 2011!). My G5 is retired due to hardware failure, so I have an Intel Mac running Mac OS X 10.6.8.<br /><br />I've even been successfully converting some SNES RPG music from the SNESDev.net forums after doing some optimizations for the samples (and/or replacing them due to my changed ethics on which ones to use... although that's not always possible)! I fully intend on making a new sound driver so I can make the music interactive and be able to swap out data on the fly for the songs that are either too big to be practical in their original form due to combined sample size... or in one case, way too large period due to the sheer number of patterns I used (it's also interactive). I've even decided to make new tracks in the original style and then perform my optimizations (that's because the originals are now my master-quality samples).<br /><br />These days, though, I'm in college, so I can't guarantee a soundtrack every month (well, I <em>could</em> do one track per game, but again, I can't guarantee that...). My schedule becomes more free starting mid-May (although in this case, it may only be brief... normally summers are open).<br /><br />I have gained the ability to look up code in hexadecimal, though, using a hex editor. I've gotten very good at this because I invent music modifiers, and I do so with no debugger needed. This includes manipulating/looking up pointers (both on the SNES and SPC700 end), and reverse-engineering music data (again, both on SNES and SPC700 end, since some games send note data from the SNES side to the SPC700).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3572">KungFuFurby</a> — Mon Mar 02, 2015 9:40 am</p><hr />
