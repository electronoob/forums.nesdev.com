In many places there are rows of 4 or 5 of them. Can you imagine how that would flicker on the NES? But since they just sit there, they could be drawn on the background. However, they can't be always background, because some fall from the top of trees, some are upside down, and other variations that require sprites.</div>
<br />Oh this make sense. But that is probably because your game is inspired by 16-bit games. I wouldn't have such an idea of object that can be either BG or spirtes in a game I'm making honnestly, but this is a good idea.
<br />
<br />Altough, in most cases 8x16 sprites will increase flickering more than 8x8, exept in the particular case you mentionned.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In my game I use 8x16 sprites to reduce the amount of sprites on screen. My status bar alone uses 10 8x16 sprites to display vital information (4 digits of health, 3 digits of MP, 3 digits of heart amount, letters H and M to represent "Health" and "Mana", a heart icon, and an 8x16 pixel reprentation of the current subweapon). Without 8x16 sprites this would take 15 sprites, and that's kind of a waste. 10 sprites may still sound like a lot (and I guess it is), but the player only uses 4-6 sprites, and most enemies take 6(moderate size) to 10(large) sprites, and most of the time there are only 2 to 3 of them on screen at once with about a max of 4 weapons on screen (generally 2-3 sprites). So there are usually about 40 sprites on screen maximum. If I were using 8x8 sprites, this would mean there are ~75 sprites, which is not possible without mega flickering.
<br />
<br />I use 8x8 sprites for my polygon engine though, because it's way too much complication to deal with on the fly. But that's way off topic.
<br />
<br />I do agree that it's kind of a waste when something is only 4x4 pixels and you have to use 2 tiles for it though. However, since you can grab from both pattern tables, I think it makes up for it. Being able to draw something as both BG and sprite without wasting tiles is really good.
<br />
<br />But when using 8x16, I hate that I give up the scanline counter. I have lots of CHR RAM updates I need to do in Vblank, and it would be really handy with a scanline counter so I wouldn't have to do fixed timed code and waste cycles while I could be doing something else.

<br />Yeah, I see what you mean. My own graphics have a lot of transparent areas wasting pattern table space and interfering with the sprite limit. I try to place such areas at the bottom of the objects, so that when placed on the floor the transparent pixels stay below the ground, where there usually aren't many sprites.
<br />
<br />I agree with Celius, only 64 8x8 sprites cover a very small area of the screen, and being able to double that is a big advantage. For most games with small characters, 8x8 is probably fine, but when they are somewhat large, the flickering can be unbearable.
