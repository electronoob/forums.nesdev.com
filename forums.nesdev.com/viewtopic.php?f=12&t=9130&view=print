<br />
<br />Also I want to map range set to $7E0000-$7FFFFF, where we must select between RAM and ROM, If you can Implent this in BSNES, This will make things easier.

<br />
<br />Best you have now is S-DD1. You can map up to 256MB into 1MB blocks. Note that real hardware is almost certainly limited to 8MB, but I can't confirm from the software level like I can that SPC7110 can only support 8MB.
<br />
<br />If you want more, you'll have to make it yourself. It's actually really easy, but I don't want to keep making fake chips without majorly compelling reasons.
<br />
<br />&gt; Also I want to map range set to $7E0000-$7FFFFF, where we must select between RAM and ROM
<br />
<br />Impossible. Cartridges already respond in that range, but the SNES CPU ignores them and uses WRAM automatically. You cannot override it.

I mean there were about 2,500 unique SNES games made with no mapping at all, after all :P
<br />
<br />SNES gives you up to 12MB of ROM/RAM address space, not limited like NES to 32K.

<br />Just to confirm: this is correct.  The upper 8 bits of the full 24-bit effective address when using DP is $00.  In English: you can set D to $0000 to $FFFF, and thus the address will always be $00/0000 to $00/FFFF.

<br />I still can use CA65, just can be hard for SNES code!
<br />
<br />About the Bank Problem: Some games tend to not work when converting source to NES to SNES.
<br />
<br />Let's say I have disassembled Hebereke all the way (Not true for now) and I need to port it to use SNES code, Only One Problem, It depends on FME7 or MMC3 as the mapper, Otherwise it will not work!
