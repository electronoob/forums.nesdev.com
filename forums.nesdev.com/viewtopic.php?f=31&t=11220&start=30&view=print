Would be good to have his explicit permission for each title though.  Perhaps Shiru can help us get in contact with them?  Shiru is the one that posted about their work with Sgt Helmet afterall.  So maybe he has better contact info for them besides PMs.  <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Get me a serial boot cable so that I can stash the client in the app bank </div> I'll get that and a blank INL-ROM flash board packed up over the weekend so you can play around with it next week hopefully.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Choose a headliner for the label and title screen </div> I don't know how necessary this is, if we feel that we really need one and don't have anything comparable to Streemerz this time around perhaps we can use love story since it took first place in the compo.  I don't know if it would as fitting in the cartridge label like we did with streemerz since it's not quite as complete/polished.  But it could be fitting in the title screen perhaps, but generic nesdev/action53 splash screen would work IMO.<br /><br />Things are kind of bleeding together between threads, but this seems to be our general action53 compilation thread.  We have permission to include NESpix, and I think it'll work out well.  A few items need to be handled though.  While NESpix is SNROM with battery backing, it's only 32KB prg (or less), and it only uses WRAM for saves.  From what I can tell WRAM is untouched until you actually go to save the current project.  So converting to our mapper seems reasonable and I should be able to convert it to use flash for saves.<br /><br />My thought on making user flash available to any games/tools who choose to use it, is fix the first 8KB of the PRG-ROM to $6000-7FFF.  For all intensive purposes that can always be there.  Using fixed banks and only allowing flashing to $6000-7FFF provides some security to only allowing those two 4KB sectors to be erased/programmed.  I'd like to ship Tepples a board with this configuration so he has it for his own testing purposes along with the serial bootloader cable if there are no objections to this configuration.  This setup also makes things simple for the bootloader as it can operate with the basis that user flash is always fixed to $6000-7FFF.  The bootloader code itself would have to be stored outside of these two 4KB sectors though along with all the other tools/games.<br /><br />Perhaps we could make the menu smart enough to sense SRAM vs. Flash, so the same rom could work on both platforms as well.  Alternatively we could have a separate build for each.<br /><br />I really like thefox's <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=11255#p128985" class="postlink">idea</a> about NESpix:<br /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">infiniteneslives wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Curious what you guys think about it's &lt;NESpix&gt; inclusion with Action53 volume2.</div><br />I think it's a good idea. Including stuff like this and the serial bootloader could coax people into getting their feet wet with NES development. Which, with your suggestion about using Flash, immediately brings forth another idea: the graphics editor(s) could be used to edit graphics in some small game that is included in the cartridge.</div><br /><br />Initially I thought that it might not be that reasonable as we need to actually figure out what game to do this with.  But I think we have the perfect game now in our library for this use now that we're including CHASE.  Not only is it a simple NROM game, but it also is meant to be a tutorial introduction to programming the NES with C.  So it sounds like the ultimate matchup to get people interested in NES development.  They can tweak the graphics to CHASE with the pairing of NESpix, then they can take it one step further and dig into Shiru's code.<br /><br />The best way I can imagine this working is by adding some options to the menu of both NESpix and CHASE.  In CHASE's menu, the option would be added to overwrite Pattern tables by selecting which of the three NESpix save slots to use.  Alternatively this choice could be handled by the action53 menu, but it should be able to be done from within the CHASE rom alone.  Additionally one would want to have the option within NESpix to copy CHASE's chr data into a selected save slot/project.  This is necessary so the user can know which tiles are used for what once running in CHASE.<br /><br />Part of me can't help but think we're biting off more than we/I can chew with all these elaborate ideas.  If we're able to pull it off, I think it would be well worth it though.  With all these additions beyond the compo entries it's starting to really feel like an action packed cart. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

I can't think of any other games off hand where you can make a graphics hack from within the game itself.  Sounds like a lot of progress is being made, I'd try it out but I can't remember which emulators support this (are there any powerpak mappers that work as well?).

As far as I can tell, for FLASH 'PROMs you'd have to allow writes to the entire bottom (or top) 32K in order to turn on writing &amp;// erasing mode, because the signaling sequence involves ROM A0-A14 (and keeping all of the higher address lines as all 0s or all 1s).<br /><br />Not that widening the writable window to 32K is particularly onerous...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Good point lidnariq.  I forgot about the unlock commands being allowed writes and all.  <br /><br />I still think it'd be good to procedurally only allow flash writes to $6000-7FFF.  Mainly because flash code has to operate from ram, and flash unlocks need to write to what's typically a mapper address.  So you have to be concerned about what bank is mapped to $8000-FFFF if you were writing to flash in that address range.  So we can still get comparable protection by procedural means alone.

Really simple, but doesn't address emulator compatibility, and opens the entire bottommost 32 KiB to writes.</li><li>Add a banking register that allows the window at $6000-$7FFF to be banked between the 2nd and 3rd (or 61st and 62nd) 8KiB slices of ROM. This should let you restrict the writeable range to only the same 16 KiB that include the signaling sequence addresses.</li><li>Map CPU $6xxx to ROM 0x02xxx and CPU $7xxx to ROM 0x05xxx (or vice versa), which is noncontiguous but then it's entirely transparent and you get the desired 8 KiB RAM-like appearance.
