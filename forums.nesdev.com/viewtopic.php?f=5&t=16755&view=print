I wonder if the store realizes what they are selling. It's just a little locally owned game store, so I'm kinda guessing not.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />People calling pirate bootlegs* &quot;homebrews&quot; does a lot to hurt the community in general. Remember Mike calling Streemerz a &quot;Bionic Commando romhack&quot;? This gives our games an aura of illegitimacy, which is something similar to how people associate emulation with piracy. Too bad bootleggers don't care about any of that and they would rather use the term &quot;homebrew&quot; to help sell their garbage.<br /><br /><br />*(I'm honestly going to stop using the term &quot;reproduction&quot; for those, it IS a bootleg, usually made to get some $$$ with other people's hard work, end of story)

I think the process of creating these is very cool, and legitimate for personal uses, but making money off selling them is 100% the definition of bootlegging. And calling them &quot;reproductions&quot; feels like an attempt to whitewash it, which seems to have gone through with eBay who does nothing to stop these.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />But there's several unlicensed releases that aren't homebrew. Tengen, wisdom tree, the previously unreleased games the oliver twins found in their attics, and so on.<br /><br />I think there's a distinction between a reproduction and a reprint. In this context, a reprint is whenever a new batch is required because the first &quot;print&quot; sold out. These may be years apart, sometimes. A reproduction implies that the reproduced material has been out of production for quite a while and has been resumed by someone. Usually by another part that had nothing to do with the original run. Usually this is also unlawful.<br /><br />(in other contexts, a repro might simply be any copy made from an original such as a photo from negative or a manually or mechanically reproduced painting).

It's hard to set a date for famiclone homebrew, as Chinese companies continued to produce originals and fan demakes for famiclones for years after the Famicom and NES were discontinued in Japan and the West.
