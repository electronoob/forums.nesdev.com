<br />Bregalad, it was discussed in this thread on few pages - because it is way easier to ignore 2048 bytes with discrete logic (just a single IC) than $17 bytes. Of course, a CPLD or the flag ROM approach may be used to get these extra 2K, but this out of the 'simple stuff' category. And it is generally better to have a single standart than few variants, for compatibility reasons.

<br />Wouldn't it be just as easy to ignore...say...$20 bytes as it is $800?

<br />
<br />But as long as you expand the memory in a crazy way you'd probably want to expand it as fully as possible, and the very fullest possible is $4018-$FFFF.
<br />
<br />I don't like to repeat myself but this is decodable with a single PAL/GAL chip which are cheap and common, just like the 74xxx series. There is NO need for a CPLD or something that complex.
<br />However, it's true you have to program the PAL/GAL chip and this can be a problem for someone with limited acess to material. This doesn't preven them to use less bytes and use another chip - but at least making the "standard" (that will prbably never ever be used anyways) would be to have up to $4018-$FFFF available.

<br />
<br />The test does not test whole address space, but since the code is located in $4800 and vectors are in the top bank, it'll show if this works. A better test could be made easily now, if it will be needed.
<br />
<br />Next step is to test the hardware designs, and if they work, make something more serious, to have a reason to put the support into official FCEUX and other emulators.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've got to fix by bug before I can get your test running Shiru.
<br />
<br />For what it's worth Lidnariq's test is more along the lines of what I would suggest for your next rom.  It actually shows you what addresses aren't being read properly and verifies that the ROM isn't enabled below $4800 per the current format.  It's nice to have easy to interpret feeback on the actual problem vice crashing because you've got some issue and have no idea what it is.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure but it also appears to verify the data so I imagine that if you did the decoding improperly but still enabled the ROM at the right address range it'll point out the failure.
<br />
<br />EDIT: linariq, is my previous statement actually correct?  Does your rom have unique chunks of data that it's verifing at each address?  Because if so the problem I'm having is a bit more complex.  It would suggest that I'm having a timing issue or something when PRG A12 is the ONLY signal that is activating my address decoder.  Because when I implement it improperly with the ROM active from $4000 and above I do get proper data at $5000.  I can't think of what would cause this besides a timing issue...
<br />
<br />EDIT 2:  That last question got me thinking.  Normally PRG /CE is an inversion of M2 (phi2) from $8000 to $FFFF.  However in my previous code I enabled PRG ROM /CE solely based on the fact that the address was &gt;= $4800, so the result was that the ROM's /CE wouldn't toggle like it's used to as an inversion of m2.  It would STAY active anytime PRG A11-15 was high.  I need some clarification on how linariq's test actually works, BUT it appears due to timing issues decoding $5000-5800 may not be as simple as one would hope.  I decided to change my implementation to the below and I passed linariq's AND shiru's tests with flying colors.

Honestly I don't really have an idea how you could test that a particular address of ROM is read or not read properly. Like, I can put certain values into existing ROM addresses, but what I have to compare them against? And how can I decide that a value that reads back below $4800 is not from ROM?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well linariq's solution seemed good to me.  I'm guessing he incremented the data in ROM or something so that you could compare it to a counter or some sequence of operations.
<br />
<br />Atleast now I've got it working in hardware and I'm not searching for the non-existent bug in my hardware.  I didn't look heavily over the logic behind the discrete design but based on what I learned it appears you need to ensure that the ROM /CE signal is an inversion of M2 when active.  It's possible that other designs would have more delays that would self correct this problem, however I'd be careful about relying on inherent delay in a mapper design...
<br />
<br />I think linariq's test is already checking for this but one option you could try is putting more text or something on the screen.  Then there wouldn't need to be a comparison in your code.  The verification would be on screen.
<br />
<br />The other thing would be to verify that the sound and controller registers are properly blocked by the mapper.  Linariq seems to be checking/sensing High-Z at those addresses.
