<br />
<br />I, ideally, wanted to use 32k of SRAM for my game, but was wondering what the hell to do with all that space...  I guess I could compress the living shit out of stuff and store it there iif I needed to.
<br />
<br />I think that some games store multiple copies of a save in the SRAM to check and see if the save's been corrupted or anything, but I'm not too sure.  I think one of the Dragon Warriors does this maybe?

<br />That's probably a good idea. You can use hashes/checksums to detect currupt saves, and as long as one of the copies is OK you can restore the saved data.
<br />
<br />Personally, I don't plan on using SRAM anytime soon. Most of the things I want to do can work with just 2KB of RAM and passwords.

One bank could be reserved for your map and objects, another for the sound engine (to store uncompressed music and SFX data), a third for your battle system (for a JRPG) or your menu system or other user interface stuff, and the fourth for save files.
<br />
<br />With 8K reserved for save files I can think of a lot of cool things you could do. You could allow every map to remember a lot about it's state. You could keep a running counter of how many of each type of enemy has been defeated. Or you could just allow the user to have 16 save slots, each with a double backup <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Also, passwords = the stuff you scrape off your shoe after walking 20 dogs in the park  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" />

<br />
<br />I do recall that Final Fantasy on Wonderswan and likely other FF games on other platforms would have many save slots even though only two were visible as it would have a checksum for each save and if one was corrupted it would go to the previous save for that slot. 
<br />
<br />Given the number of games that just have non-battery backed RAM shows how useful it can be so it's no surprise the majority of the memory isn't actually for saves. 
<br />
<br />The Startropics games actually use their SRAM probably almost exclusively for saving since I assume to cut cost they have a much smaller amount of SRAM than any of cartridges.

<br />
<br />Systems that uses EEPROM or Flash based saves seems to usually save on a different chip than the one the game is programmed on. At least it's the case on the GBA and on those Bandai NES games with EEPROM saves.
<br />
<br />Personally I like the idea of Flash / EEPROM based saves as it is MUCH less likely to loose your saves. I've lost my saves on NES/SNES/GBA games quite a few times, without even the batteries being dead. You just don't know why this happens.

<br />Probably, but it's different. The amount of SRAM is smaller but it's very well protected, unlike early MMC1 games where the save could be a goner any time, no matter if you push the reset button or not.

In theory, one could use SOROM and replace the second PRG RAM with an EEPROM of some sort. But that would still probably cost more than devoting the first, say, 64 KB of a 256 KB SNROM or 512 KB SUROM to saves.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Having only one slot sorts of sucks because you can't lend the game to your brothers/cousins/friends</div>

<br />You're not supposed to lend it. You're supposed to buy a new copy for them.

<br />
<br />I must have been tired at the time. No idea where I got "two" from. I'm pretty sure FF on wonderswan and other consoles generally have 3 or 4 save slots plus hidden backups to deal with possible save corruption. 
<br />
<br />EEPROM sounds nice for saving but there will be a limited write cycle life and then the chip itself needs replacing which is not as easy as replacing a battery unless you have a standardized EEPROM that is cheap and socketed to the board so it is just a matter of lifting the dead one out and inserting a fresh chip. The idea of backing up saves via a sort of memory card device is nice though.

A bunch of games saving to SD cards put into their own cartridges would be strange unless you actually needed to save some huge amount of data.
