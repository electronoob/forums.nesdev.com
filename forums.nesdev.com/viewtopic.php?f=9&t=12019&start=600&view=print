		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks. See that wiggly line at the far left? The fact that it bends is evidence of the dropped dot. If it's that wiggly on hardware, then perhaps the skipped dot handling is three accurate five you.*<br /><br />To be even more sure, I'd like to see another high-speed camera video in the &quot;Overscan&quot; test, with left set to 1 pixel and top set to 0 pixels.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">*That's one more than &quot;too accurate for you&quot;.</span>

I'd like to see this fixed along with restoring the missing bottom row and handling emphasis bits more correctly. It's just up to the author as far as what he feels is worth his time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just finished installing my Hi-Def NES HDMI today and there's something odd and I want to make sure it's not just on mine.<br /><br />When running it at 1080p, there's a distortion at the top of the screen. It's just basically a line or two at the very top flickering back and forth like crazy. It is not the random &quot;speckles&quot; that others mention. <br /><br />I have tried this on 3 different television sets and two different HDMI cables and 23 different games and they all have it. <br /><br />I am trying to figure out of anyone else here had this issue. I want to put my system back together but not until I'm sure it's not just me with the issue.<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />Edit: I just went back a few pages and it seems like this is a known issue. Does it go away with a firmware downgrade? Why does this happen with the HiDef NES but it doesn't with the NESRGB?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I installed my Hi-Def NES recently, and it works great for all except two games: Blaster Master and Super Mario Bros. 2. <br /><br />These games start playing fine, but they soon start to have what I've dubbed 'vertical spasms,' which get more and more frequent, and only seem to affect tiles and background, not the player or enemies. They could possibly be related to the vertical scrolling issue that I've seen come up in other areas of the internet (I've watched Blaster Master scroll once, but only once). At this point I have no clue as to what is causing it, and why it only affects two games.<br /><br />I followed the guide (almost) perfectly, now having tried anything I didn't do/could have done better (with the exclusion of the Lockout chip mod). <br /><br />The caps have been replaced, the Q1 transistor was removed and outer holes bridged (though RF was corrupted last time I checked, AV does the same thing to the two games). <br /><br />The original board I was going to mod didn't feel like letting go of the PPU on three pins right next to each other, and the board was charred in that location after all the attempts. So it was taken to someone who knows how to desolder better than I can, and he recommended using a different board, so I swapped the Power Modules from the boards, placing the re-capped module on the board in the modded NES. Since its a &quot;module,&quot; i would assume that they are interchangeable with all the different design plans they have.<br /><br />Speaking of PPU, could it be I have one that just doesn't like the mod?<br /><br />If anyone wants a video for an in-depth look at the bug, I could make one. <br /><br />If there is not technical explanation and it is the firmware, then I'm in trouble because I have no flashcart. I could get one, but I want to save that as a last resort.<br /><br />EDIT: Doing the &quot;last resort&quot; of the troubleshooting page (unmodding the NES) resulted in Blaster Master working fine. I've ordered an Everdrive to 'update' the firmware, hopefully this will fix it.
