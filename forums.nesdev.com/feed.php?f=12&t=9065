The host cartridges are all low rom, 1mbyte or smaller games.   The f-zero will save your progress if you add a battery (or use the 5 in 1 set up)<br />It is possible to run hi roms with some re-wiring of the host carts pi outs.  I think 8 lines need to be swapped if memory serves.   thanks to no-cash, you can edit the instruction file and void the security chip.   <br />Have fun!<br /><br />Edit:  mode 7????<br /><br />Oh, and you'll definitely want the version 3 bios too.<br /><br />Below is a pic of the edited menu.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5779">Markfrizb</a> — Thu Sep 05, 2013 9:15 pm</p><hr />

Apologies on reviving a dead thread - I've just acquired an NSS in beautiful shape and have it running with the default carts. I've read through this thread - the progress that you guys have made is incredible. However, I have a few questions. I apologize if they seem noob/have been answered earlier.<br /><br /> - I want to check out Magic Floor on the real hardware, although I'm not sure how to go about splitting an NSS rom so I can put it on an EEPROM. Any advice? <br /> - Does anyone know what a suitable replacement would be for the IC4 chip? Do we even need this anymore or can we bypass it in the PRG ROM?<br /> - I saw that there are some issues with getting MODE7 games running on the NSS, but I would really love to switch out Super Tennis for something better. I need a little direction <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />.<br /><br />Any advice is appreciated.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6153">darkchao</a> — Thu Sep 05, 2013 10:15 am</p><hr />

DogP has tested the Game/Demo-mode detection being used in the Magic Floor NSS version (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/magicflr.htm">http://nocash.emubase.de/magicflr.htm</a><!-- m -->). I have been afraid that it might fail on real hardware.... but, it worked perfectly!<br />The detection works by reading the 17th bit from the serial joypad data, ie. same as the &quot;joypad-connected&quot; detection on normal SNES consoles. On the NSS the bit means &quot;joypad enabled&quot;. For a nice arcade-feeling one can use that detection to &quot;autostart when money inserted&quot;. <br />A pity that the original NSS games didn't support that feature, but at least they didn't show &quot;no joypad connected error&quot; messages in demo mode - which would have looked really bad.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5211">nocash</a> — Tue Dec 25, 2012 5:13 am</p><hr />

Cool, many thanks for running the tests! And sorry about the late reply!<br />Seeing the I/O ports &amp; mirrors is nice.<br />The VBL test does apparently show VSYNC timings (not VBLANK), and with the bit being inverse of what I had guessed.<br />The OFF test disables NMIs (and does show wait-for-NMI timeouts as expected).<br />The NMI test was meant to enable NMIs (but does also run into timeouts, damn)<br /><br />Now I am bit clueless how to enable NMIs... either it requires some strange combination of Port 00h Bit0 and Bit1... maybe enable AND acknowledge or so... or maybe the NMI source is missing... it might be Vblank or Vsync from OSD chip... or fromSNES PPU... or maybe NMIs are triggered by SNES controller reads or whatever.<br /><br />Btw. if somebody wants to modify the Z80 source code of the test proggy: You could assemble that Z80-dialect with the Utility/AssembleFile function from my no$zx emulator.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5211">nocash</a> — Sun Dec 02, 2012 10:20 am</p><hr />

Just a misc update... I shortened the cables to my SNES cart adapter by about 4&quot;, and it's much better... but still not 100%.  Using my original Mario Kart cartridge, there's only a few lines across the screen.  On my flash cart, the screen looks perfect, but the game still glitches when you drive.<br /><br />So, I guess I should just finish laying out the PCB and get it made... then see where I'm at.<br /><br />DogP<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5709">DogP</a> — Wed Oct 31, 2012 12:20 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">nocash wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />One possible problem might be that the program is accessing the OSD chip too soon after reset. The datasheet is mentioning 'something' about 1ms on last page (not quite clear what that means, and how it fits to reset signals that might be generated by the NSS mainboard). Anyways, the OSD chip is re-initialized in each test screen - if you push some of the four joypad direction keys then the program should redo the OSD init far away from the reset signal.<br /><br />There should be also some new activity visible on the OSD SPI bus when pushing joypad DPAD buttons, that might also help to see if the Z80 is running or crashed.<br /></div><br />I didn't have time to hook up the logic analyzer... I'll do that tomorrow night.  But I did do the controller test, and it does cause activity on the SPI pins (Left/Right do a lot, Up/Down do just a short blip), but there's still nothing on the screen.  So, the code is running, but apparently something isn't quite right.  Hopefully the logic analyzer will give us a clue.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">nocash wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />With the dumped font &amp; the datasheet details about things like character sizes and the odd scrolling/wrapping feature, my OSD emulation is now looking much nicer.

Here's the new no$sns version with improved NSS emulation <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/sns.htm">http://nocash.emubase.de/sns.htm</a><!-- m --> (it's currently completely freeware, all versions available with and without donations; I am totally broke so it doesn't matter if I don't get money or not). It's now working with all NSS games via the 12 keys in <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/nss-keys.zip">http://nocash.emubase.de/nss-keys.zip</a><!-- m -->. My homebrew NSS game is also updated, <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/magicflr.htm">http://nocash.emubase.de/magicflr.htm</a><!-- m --> (with nicer BG graphics, more OSD colors, and lowercase text, and punctuation marks matched to the OSD font). And, my NSS specs in <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/fullsnes.htm">http://nocash.emubase.de/fullsnes.htm</a><!-- m --> are also updated (with info from the OSD datasheet and some other new notes).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5211">nocash</a> — Tue Oct 23, 2012 5:42 pm</p><hr />
