		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When you say VGA, are you referring to video adapter emulation in general or do you quite literally mean classic 320x200x256 (i.e. segment A000) mode?  Or are you talking about VESA?<br /><br />To me, the funny part is that you're wanting accuracy and clean code -- yet PC architecture in general is far from clean.  In fact, it's a complete clusterfuck.  Do not even for a minute think that just because we're into the 21st century that somehow PC emulation is &quot;easy&quot; -- it's not.  My point is that &quot;PC emulation&quot; -- the term -- is simply too vague.  And don't get me started on the utter disgusting mess that is the &quot;&quot;evolution&quot;&quot; (double-double quotes!) of x86.<br /><br />That said, I have zero complaints about VMware Workstation other than it's fairly slow (it doesn't offer paravirtualisation to the same degree that, say, ESXi does).  But I wouldn't use it to play old DOS games, for example.<br /><br />Honestly I think that most folks who go apeshit over use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_emulation" class="postlink">HLE</a> are usually wanting to waste CPU time emulating hardware down to the transistor/gate level for little-to-no gain.  There are emulators which do this of course, and the system requirements of such emulators are preposterous; the trade off isn't worth it in most cases.

If not, why are you spending energy trying to convince <em>us</em> that it matters? Surely that effort would be better spent convincing MESS's &amp;// DOSbox's dev teams instead.<br /><br />Anyway, is retrodev for the XT a real thing?

But to developers, a laptop with a perfect emulator is a way to ensure no reliance on emulation defects that's easier to lug around than the original machine and its monitor. I think that's what Alegend45 is talking about.

So forget having it run on an emulator and then run exactly the same on hardware. Even hardware fails at this.
