		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />sorry for necro-digging this thread, but I would like add support for iNES 2.0 headers in MESS and I have a couple of questions:
<br />
<br />1. can I assume 
<br />
<br />if ((flag7 &amp; 0xc) == 0x8)  iNES2.0
<br />else older iNES
<br />? 
<br />
<br />is there anything else I should check to identify the newer headers?
<br />
<br />2. could you provide me with two sample headers for carts requiring different submappers, to play with? e.g. two mapper 34 'extended' headers setting the different submappers required? the wiki page is not really specific on how submappers should be handled, and I'd love to get rid of the crc hack I'm currently using [1]
<br />
<br />thanks for the help
<br />
<br />
<br />[1] in fact, in addition to adopting iNES2.0, I'm also working on adding support for separate CHR &amp; PRG files, by using a MAME-like database in xml form, with an attribute for the PCB type. Combining the two methods (separate prg/chr for cart dumps + iNES2.0 for demo/homebrew and for backward compatibility with the ROMs most users want to load), I hope to remove the current crc checks for good...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />sorry for the second necro-bumping, but I have now implemented basic iNES 2.0 support in MESS: we check if the format is 2.0, we check for additional mapper bits and for additional PRG/CHR bank bits. The remaining info are only logged at the moment (which should be more or less the same level of 2.0 compatibility offered by Nintendulator, according to the wiki <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> )
<br />
<br />I would like to test the extended prg/chr feature somehow though. I seem to remember there was a multicart with 256 PRG banks, does anyone remember which game it was?
<br />
<br />and what should be the extended header for this specific game (so that I can fix it manually)?
<br />
<br />thanks for any help you might offer.

Please see here for my suggested change to the iNES (and NES 2.0) formats - <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=9221">viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=9221</a><!-- l --><br /><br />And second, the PPU type entry for VS System games is nice - but there are some games that can be DIP-switched to different PPUs (Atari RBI Baseball, Battle City, Star Luster, Super Sky Kid, Super Xevious, Tengen's Tetris, TKO Boxing, and maybe more).<br />For that games, specifying something like &quot;PPU Tyoe when all corresponding DIP-Switches are OFF&quot; would be clearer.<br /><br />Agree with that two things? Better ideas?<br /><br />And where would one change or ask to change such specs? Is this <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0</a><!-- m --> the &quot;official&quot; specification (and changes to that page would become official)?

What with so many ideas being <em>proposed</em> but none actually being <em>used</em> I'm finding it impossible to actually do any decisive.<br /><br />The wiki is just full of 'ideas' for the extended iNES header. Take for instance mapper # 1. I can get the byte to know which mapper a ROM uses but what about which board etc. I refuse point blank to use a database for all the obvious reasons and I think that it is unreasonable just to check to see how much PRG bank there are too see if a ROM has UNROM or UOROM.<br /><br />The truth is this should have all been done right back at the start of the whole NES emulation scene and I don't mean to disrepect anybody who was working on it at the time (I know that a lot of stuff wasn't known back then; bus conflicts, 100's of mappers (hence only 4 bits being originially designated for mappers)).<br /><br />It seems to me that with the literally 1,000,000s of NES ROMs floating around the internet its simply too late to actually introduce a decent standard now. How on earth are we going to go back and find all of these ROMs and actually update them so that they are 2.0 compatible?
