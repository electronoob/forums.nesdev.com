I feel like a hypothetical NROM-128 project is outside that context. But I still disagree with the premise. If you're making an NROM-128 project you could still get more mileage for size out of assembly than the &quot;bloated&quot; by comparison C, right? &quot;But someone could care less about the size benefit of assembly and care more about the time it takes to write in an NROM-256 project.&quot; Yes. Sure. Okay.<br /><br />I guess in general, I feel that while the information presented may add to the thread, I feel that because it's posted as a reply to me, but not as a reply to what I feel like I said that confuses me about how to respond. I answered about features from C++ I use that aren't templates, it doesn't mean there's never a reason not to use them. I can see how that can maybe be gotten from &quot;I don't have a reason to use Y&quot;, but I'd have said &quot;There's no reason to use Y&quot; if I meant that. <br /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">This library is pretty sweet: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt">https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt</a><!-- m --></div><br />Heheh! I know of it. It might be interesting to start a C/++ resource thread, but there's not much I can personally cosign as &quot;used in an actual project&quot;.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I mean the whole point of high level languages is to abstract away from the underlying asm, so when I'm coding in C I'm only worried about optimizing on a macro scale. Unless I was doing something time-critical/embedded, the amount of time/effort it would take to either A.) write inline-asm that doesn't break the rest of the program (and doesn't gcc force you to use the ugly AT&amp;T syntax for x86?) or B.) writing C code that translates into optimal asm isnt worth it, to me at least.
