In fact, what we're doing here is waiting for 2 VBlanks, not 2 frames (which I believe is the source of confusion). According to the wiki, when the first VBlank happens the PPU isn't ready for use yet, so it's only logical that we wait for the next one.

The code I linked to had a second vblank wait at the end.  So I was running with to waits and no initial BIT $2002 initially.  Things were always garbled at power on, but okay after reset.  I resolved the issue initially by adding another wait, but was then able to replace it with the BIT $2002 before the first loop.<br /><br />thefox, I tested you original rom out again and wasn't able to steadily replicate the original issue I was seeing the day before.  I wanted to re-verify what I had seen before testing the new rom.  The day I saw issues my NES had been running for several hours, so I'm curious if having the PPU all warmed up might have attributed to the consistency of failing initially.  I'll try to remember to try again after I've been running my NES for awhile.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">sonder wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">qbradq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">In case anyone cares, I've created a test ROM for TNROM or TGROM boards that have been retrofitted with 32KB of CHR-RAM and rerouted to allow all 32KBs to be bank-selected.

Can 2kb be allocated for 2 extra nametables?  (I'll hazard a guess that it doesn't work that way.)</div><br /><br />It's plenty practical.   I'm producing boards right now that have 32KB of CHR-RAM.  The second version of my boards is actually just finished being fabricated and it supports 32KB and 128KB CHR-RAM options, those will be in production shortly.  As for extra nametables, that's actually possible too.  Although to simplify things a little I'd probably just put all 4 NT's in the cart's CHR-RAM and just disable NES's CIRAM (aka VRAM).  You wouldn't necessarily have to make it a non-standard mapper either in regards to emulation.  You could emulate it as MMC3 presumably with 4screen mirroring, and 128KB of CHR-RAM.  In practice though, you'd have to consider the last (or first) 4KB as off limits for pattern table data.  You could do the same thing with 32KB of CHR-RAM also (4KB NT, 28KB PT).<br /><br />You could even go as far as to bank switch the Nametables by adding nametable select registers to the mapper.  That's a little extreme though, but entirely possible without much hassle in hardware.  Emulating it would be a different story, but all you have to do to gain mapper support a from a few emulators is build a game or good demo for it.  &quot;If you build it, they will come.&quot;  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

Which then promptly gained support in emus, powerpak, and production carts?  I think you single handedly proved my point with the multi-discrete mapper. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />My 'build it' implied easily programmable hardware that would allow you to get by without an emu.  At least to the point of a functioning demo.  It would still be drastically better than the multiple eprom method that our favorite licensed games were developed with.  Personally I prefer testing each build on the real hardware anyways, the only thing I appreciate emus for is debugging video with PT/NT viewers.
