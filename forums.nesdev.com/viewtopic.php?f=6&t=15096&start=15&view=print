I only have my personal laptop to develop and test, so on my end...it seems to work perfectly.<br /><br />I guess I will have to download some other C++ compiler and read up on how to make it work on Linux. However, I am also very busy... so it may take me a while. And I have no Linux computer to test it with.

I haven't tested the famitracker driver version that Shiru just posted on his website, but I may try to use it for the ninja game, if it works as I expect.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you for your answers, i made my own converter in Java. It's work fine and i make it more verbose (Example it's said when pitch is out of range). Also like i said previously, i add some modifications to Famitone and it's work with Duty Envelope so i called it Schadetone because, it's Famitone but with my name... Anyway. I could put the code here then my project will be finish, but the comments and variables are in French. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> Maybe i will make later my own music editor who can take in charge patterns with different lengths for size optimization.<br /><br />PS : Yes, i hate Windows. LINUX POWWWWER !

I haven't tested the asm code as much as I would have liked to, since the bug fix yesterday. The NESASM version was fully tested.

It was easy, I just had to remove the precompiled-header stdafx.h and also conio.h which provide none posix function like _stricomp, fortunately the dropin posix replacement is just strcasecmp.<br /><br />Here's the code: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://pastebin.com/Yp0cUDzh">https://pastebin.com/Yp0cUDzh</a><!-- m -->.
