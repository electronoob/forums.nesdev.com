That's true. The PCE is however quite popular here (it's just the TG16, i.e. typically the western market, that failed) and I have it (which is the <em>latest</em> console I own) so I have enough reasons to develop on it. Also, you can also make CD games, so that you can test games on the real system with CDRs (which virtually every one has the equipment to burn), without the need to mess with annoying hardware such as dev. carts or to acquire a flashcart.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4653">Gilbert</a> — Tue Jun 21, 2011 7:57 pm</p><hr />

The popularity of a console is an important factor to consider when deciding whether to develop for it or not. It must be really frustrating when you realize you can't buy consoles or cartridges for your hobby, or to find out that nobody will play your games.<br /><br />Personally, I've never seen a PC-Engine/TurboGrafx. I played a couple of games through emulation, but I never even heard of it before I had internet. Even in stores exclusively dedicated to old gaming consoles there's no sign of it. As cool as it may be, I'd never develop for such an obscure platform, mainly to avoid the frustration.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Jun 21, 2011 6:55 pm</p><hr />

That'd be a good idea if the PC Engine/TurboGrafx were actually popular here. Nintendo of America was fairly successful in its anticompetitive practices during the TG16 era. But I will agree that even the TG16 is probably more popular than any specific enhanced famiclone.

I think if one wants to develop a system similar enough to the Famicom that is easier to programme (in fields such as handling of mappers, IRQs and other limitations) and is more powerful, the PC Engine is a very good choice (we know that, the Super Famicom is not as close to the Famicom as this in comparison). It is essentially a beefed up Famicom without many of the annoyances present in the older console.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4653">Gilbert</a> — Tue Jun 21, 2011 6:29 pm</p><hr />

For example, drop-in reverse-engineered chips/additional chips?  Maybe a homebrewer could make a demo or game that uses the additional features if it detects them.<br /></div><br /><br />Sure, anything is possible, but you quickly run into the age-old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus" class="postlink">Ship of Theseus</a> question - when does it stop being an NES?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />And also, here's an interesting VT03-based plug-and-play console that utilizes the high-color mode:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://fuji.drillspirits.net/samuri/">http://fuji.drillspirits.net/samuri/</a><!-- m --><br /></div><br /><br />Pretty cool to see those.  That pic of that system looks like it would be (well, relatively) easy to develop on the hardware because it's using a normal 3V flash memory chip.  Main thing would be having a programmer and socket that would support that type of packaging, and the patience to test your software without desoldering the chip repeatedly (a heat gun could make it easy, but could be bad for it if done repeatedly).<br /><br />BTW if you're not aware of it, if that's the same one I'm thinking of, there is an emulator for that chip that was on the website of the actual company that made the clone.  I only found a couple ROMs to test it with though out of curiosity, but it worked.  I don't have link for it right now though.  That'd be an easy way to start working with it.  Emulator ran normal NES roms too (looked like an adapted version of an open source emu, IIRC).<br /><br />Regarding the SPC-700 dev tools, I can say in my experience at least that I had zero problems using TASM when I wrote the SPC program for my NSF player.  Only annoyance was it didn't support .incbin, but of course it has .include so that is simple to work around with a simple bin-to-.DB app (which can be automated as well).  And with SNES stuff also, I can confirm that testing with ZSNES and SNES9X is 100% pointless unless you have it working on a real SNES first.  bsnes sounds good though, it just wasn't around for me to use at the time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Jun 21, 2011 12:35 pm</p><hr />
