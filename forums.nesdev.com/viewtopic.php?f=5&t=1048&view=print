<br />Well, it will be worse. If you make a post and if you were automatically looged out for anyother reason, when you'll press the Submit button, the board will ask you to log in again, and all the stuff you wrote would be DELETED. It already happened to me in another PHPBB board, I don't remember exactly, but it was very frustrating.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />tepples: We still get a lot of bots registering here (even with the captcha enabled), so I clean out the user list occasionally.  Easy to spot though, since they just set their homepage to suspicious sites and rarely post.  The spammers are way ahead of phpBB apparantly.
<br />
<br />Bregalad: Yeah, that always sucks.  Usually if I type a lot of text I'll do a ctrl+c to copy it to the clipboard before posting, it's a useful habit, heheh.
<br />
<br />lord_chile: I think it's due to rarity.  The gold one must be less common.  Either that or just looks that much cooler.  The software and hardware is the same.
<br />
<br />And I'm moving this thread to general.

I know that on nesdev exist links to demos.. but i think that people of this forums make more comprehensive demos and more small.. it's very good for beginners... because are demos of beginners (newbies in help center).. can you make a new stable forum in order that newbie people of this place give with links of demos that they have created???... yesterday. i finish my first demo.. hello world... and i am adding sound to it... i would like share it.. in a stable forum.. i say stable forums to forums that cannot be created by any user like newbie  help center, etc... then inside it new stable forum, we can give links of  "newbie 6502 codes" or write any codes inside it.. i suggest like name of forum..
<br />
<br />i only suggest.. i think is a very good idea-...
<br />and too experimented people can go to newbie 6502 codes and give any suggest in order to improve skills..

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />lord_Chile, I don't know if it is a good idea that the beginners start to spread their first demos around. I think the first demo is something you keep to yourself. You see, as people are just starting, they're not sure exactly what they are doing, and many times they do what they are told to in a message, just to fix their programs.
<br />
<br />Then, you end up with a simple demo that works in emulators, but as beginners are not really sure of what they're doing yet, the code is not very accurate and may not run on real hardware.
<br />
<br />Now, how can spreading bad code be good for anyone? Other beginners will get confused from reading bad code. And more experienced people... well, would be very annoyed with the newbies asking why the code they adapted from other newbie doesn't work, and having to explain everything that is wrong with it over and over. And people don't usually read long posts with source codes, it is boring. We can spot a few errors, but not all.

<br />No it won't if you use Firefox. Press the back button to return to the "Post a reply" form, open the login in a new tab, and continue. Only Microsoft Internet Explorer deletes text when you press the Back button on a phpBB.
