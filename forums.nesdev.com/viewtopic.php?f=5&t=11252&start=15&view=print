	</div><br />Frame 4 clearly proves that Mario is <em>not</em> punching Yoshi.<br />If Mario's arm movement is supposed to be a motion where his fist goes down on Yoshi's head/eye and Yoshi lowers his head as a result of the impact, then why do we see Mario's arm <em>next to</em> Yoshi's head in that frame?<br /><br />If you only saw frames 1-3 and 5, then this might be interpreted as Mario punching Yoshi on the head. But Frame 4 shows that Mario's hand and Yoshi's head are on a completely different position of the z-axis.<br /><br />So, why does this guy suddenly claim that Mario punching Yoshi was always the intention?<br /><br />Those guys at Nintendo are worse than that liar George Lucas.

Only what's in the final work is canon.<br /><br />When the Simpsons were conceived, they originally thought about Homer being secretly Krusty. But this idea was abandoned before the show even started. So, does this mean that Krusty the Klown is canonically Homer Simpson now because someone played around with that thought for five minutes?<br /><br /><br />The original artwork of Amy, the character from my game &quot;City Trouble&quot;, had a belly button piercing. Then I found out that belly button piercings were only populated in the early 90s while our game was designed as a 1986 game. That's why we removed it for the final sprite and artworks.<br /><br />So, does Amy have a belly button piercing or doesn't she have one? What weights more? The official artworks that actually went onto the box and into the game. Or some idea that existed for two weeks?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">(Did Hino even draw the final graphics?)</div><br />Doesn't matter. The in-game graphics and the official artworks show Mario not hitting Yoshi. (In frame 4 and 5, they even remove the outline of the fist in one place, to allude to Mario pointing with his finger.)

When I saw that, I thought, ‘I guess he wants Mario to ride something.’ So, when we were making Super Mario World, we had this ‘dinosaur land’ concept, and I had Hino draw reptile type art.”<br /><br />“Initially,” Hino said, “the keyword that I had was ‘horse,’ so I imagined something quite later and, for the time being, drew a large lizard type creature.”<br /><br />“It looked like a crocodile,” explained Tezuka, who felt like a reptile-looking creature might seem out of place in Mario. Tezuka drew a rough sketch of a cute character and on the basis of that, Hino created Yoshi.</div><br />Sure, <em>that's</em> where the concept of Yoshi came from: It was at the time of SMB3 when Miyamoto drew Mario on a horse. And this idea then evolved through a lizard into a dinosaur.<br /><br />It sure has <em>nothing</em> to do with the fact that Mario riding a dinosaur was already planned for SMB1 where the character already had a striking similarity to the final image of Yoshi:<div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

	</div><br />No, no, that one had nothing to do with it. Not at all. They didn't just take their old idea from 1985 and put it into SMW.<br /><br />No, no, the idea of Yoshi came to be at the time of SMB3 and it was originally supposed to be a horse that was only turned into a dinosaur as they went along.<br /><br />It's a mere coincidence that the final concept of Yoshi equals something that was already designed for SMB1.

It's easy to say that Yoshi was dropped from SMB3 due to &quot;hardware limitations&quot; when the real issue is a much more complex weighing of features and compromises regarding both game design and graphics. It's not like the NES wouldn't be able to handle mario riding a dinosaur.<br />In fact people tend to often really underestimate what the NES is really capable of. And the SNES for that matter.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&quot;Primitive&quot; can be interpreted in different ways. When talking about NROM primitivity, the design choice is such that you must fit the entirety of the game graphics inside 8kB:s, so naturally, you draw graphics in a way that can be easily reused throughout all levels, scenes, menus etc, especially in a game that's as long (NROM-relatively speaking) as SMB1. I think talking about outlines and &quot;good&quot;/&quot;bad&quot; pixel art here can be a bit misleading. <br /><br />I won't deny that there was a certain fashion around the time up to SMB1, though, which later got replaced by the more comics/cartoon-inspired outline style. <br /><br />I wouldn't say referring to &quot;hardware limitations&quot; is BS (it depends on intention), but it's all too easy to misinterpret as &quot;the machine can't do that&quot; if you aren't a developer yourself, when the truth is you have a cake and can split it into slices however you'd like, but you can't make the cake bigger. <br /><br />Ultimately, the PPU:s restrictions would/will play into the choice of having something ride something else. I'm personally struggling with that for our blaster/metroidy game project, where the solution is keeping things a bit smaller in size. I also had that &quot;problem&quot; for our iced dino riding/running minigame, where the thought of solution was to keep sprite-based obstacles strictly choreographed in appearance (no more than this or that appearing at this or that height at the same time) and drawing the dino so that the player character sprite count at the &quot;ground&quot; level was low enough. Either case, having a metasprite ride another metasprite with some sort of layering will have repercussions on the rest of design, so you must make a cut somewhere, be it accepting sprite cancelling / flickering, reducing projectile count, designing enemy movement patterns a certain way but not another, and so on.<br /><br />And in the case of SMB1 having a dino to ride on... what would you cut out from the sprite sheet in order to fit that enormous ostrich and/or pterodactyl?

Though, if mario's really supposed to hit yoshi and that was what they intended with those frames, it looks pretty sloppy when examined. <br /><br />Ultimately, it's all up to every viewer to decode - i percieve mario as making a gesture like he means to say &quot;get that for me, yoshi&quot;.

But that said, there are major differences between the two games that make a pretty big impact. Shatterhand relies heavily on bankswitching, and will switch in smaller parts of the sprite side of CHR-ROM dynamically several times throughout a single stage, to fit in new enemies, which allows way more frames on animations, compared to SMB having two frames for every walk cycle in the game. In fact, Shatterhand bankswitches the main character entirely for each different animation he can do. No wonder that game is so much more lush with content and animation compared to SMB, which spans 32 stages full of every different kind of enemy, powerup, etc. in a single 8KB CHR-ROM.<br /><br />That said, I always thought SMB had fairly ugly graphics. It could have looked much better with a better art style, but the same amount of CHR data. I don't think anyone working on the game was really computer artists in the same sense you'd have later on. I'm not even sure who designed the sprites? Miyamoto himself? They probably didn't really have graphical tools to design the sprites either, but had to sketch them out on paper. I'm just guessing here, but I think it sounds likely.

Synchronization errors in object animations happen all the time. If you look at Sonic games frame by frame there are numerous instances of delayed impact on things like springs, enemies and such. This is not surprising, considering that different objects normally have their own frame counters, and the exact moment when state changes occur or the order in which the objects are updated could easily result in off by one errors, that are unnoticeable in real time.<br /><br />This effect may even be intentional in some cases. In traditional animation, much like in video games, there are usually less actual drawings than frames per second, so alternating the animations of characters in the same scene is a cheap way to improve the overall perception of smoothness, because <em>something</em> will change every frame.
