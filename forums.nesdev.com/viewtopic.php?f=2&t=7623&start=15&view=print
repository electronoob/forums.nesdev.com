<br />
<br />That wiki page is in response to those that treat the PowerPak as the norm. The PowerPak does not work on clone systems, which is not good for me.
<br />
<br />I won't begrudge you not wanting to buy an MMC1 repro board. I'm sure you have your reasons. But I will mention that it is specifically designed to work with modern ROM and RAM chips, with no rewiring.

<br />
<br />Only problem I had with my first rewired cart was some intermittent shorting of a bent-up pin.  Putting electrical tape around it solved the problem.  But if you can get a good cut (with an exacto knife or similar) I think it's better to cut the traces instead of bending the pins.
<br />
<br />Sounds like your cart should work, only thing I can suggest is checking for bad connections, a continuity test.

<br />okay memblers was on to something. it was the trace from 2 to 22 that I forgot to cut. the tutorials on Devcarting need to be seriously updated and I volunteer to help with that as soon as I'm done having fun.

<br />
<br />I'm glad to see you got it going, I have always stayed away from trace cutting and preferred to rewire using cannibalized network cable. Once its all soldered and tested to work I use a little hot glue to hold it all neatly in place.
