Also, is there a program out there that can show the differences between two roms? A friend of mine made a hack of Who Framed Roger Rabbit a few months ago and it shows values of ram addresses when running etc, and I wanted to see what he did to it that made it do this. Or is there an easier way to beginning learning these things.<br /><br />I would really like to dive into this a bit because there is a new mystery in Blaster Master, something that has only been seen once and has not yet been reproduced. It occurs here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://youtu.be/g5Hq2eASg74?t=28m56s">https://youtu.be/g5Hq2eASg74?t=28m56s</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I was thinking that I could start by finding the subroutine that loads the boss or something like that.

First off I saw that there was a <a href="https://tcrf.net/Journey_to_Silius#Stage_Select" class="postlink">Game Genie code for Level Select on TCRF</a>.<br /><br />There is also a <a href="http://games.technoplaza.net/ggencoder/qt/" class="postlink">Game Genie decoder program</a>...  You will need a Hex Editor program.  Find one that you like.  I like Hex Workshop; but there are others that are freeware.  To compare files, there is a compare function.  However...  In this case, I found those decoded addresses by adding the offset of +$8000 to get into ROM space.  The &quot;compare&quot; value is what the Game Genie expects.  Once it finds the compare value at that bank it replaces it with the &quot;value&quot; value.  This is essentially overwriting opcodes or values for opcodes.  In the case of this code it is turning an RTS instruction to a NOP instruction which enters the level select routine.  The secondary code increases the maximum value of levels to $06 instead of $05 so that the final boss is selectable during the boss selection portion.  Not certain it's possible to jump into the level select routine naturally, but I haven't done much research yet.<br /><br />Remember that hex code can be disassembled into assembly.  You can find your differences that way through disassemblers and hex editors. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
