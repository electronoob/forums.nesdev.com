So I beat the first world on Mario Forever, then it took me to the title screen. I selected world 2, but it's world 2 of the original. I've seen what world 2 of Mario Forever is supposed to look like, and it's definitely NOT world 2 of Mario one. Does anyone have a copy with world 2 on it? I couldn't find one on google.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Dec 09, 2007 1:47 pm</p><hr />

I played Mario Forever, and I think it can be really entertaining. That is if you have the Save State function available. I got to level 4 last night. I'd like to be able to beat the game straight through some time, but I think that will be about 300 years from now.<br /><br />The wierd thing about this game, and the lost levels, is that there are some really easy short levels where a message in japanese is written out with mario blocks. The one on level 3 of this game says "Ganbare!" (Don't give up or good luck), and on the lost levels, there's one that says "Arigatou!" (Thank you). I get thrown off a little when I come to these levels, because I'm expecting this really challenging level with no floor, and it ends up being this effortless level with no enemies where you just run to the end.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Dec 09, 2007 11:39 am</p><hr />

No seriously if you don't post more details it's impossible to tell, but I beat Mega Man 1 a couple of times without cheats. I have never been able to beat Mega Man 4, 5 or 6 yet while most people seems to say they are easier than 1,2,3. That's really weird.<br /><br />BTW about Battletoads, it's really incredible, the japanese version is really MUCH MUCH easier ! They removed lot of spikes and enemies, boss have much less HP, and there is unlimited continues (I think). I beat both the rat race and the clinger winger (the two more infamously hard levels) on the FIRST try !! I cannot belive how this version is easier than the usual one.<br />And there is japanese peolpe arround to give critics of western games to be too easy... HAHAHAHA.<br /><br />And yes Mega Man X is very very easy, exept the last boss wich is very very hard. That's fun, because I noted that 99% of games are either really really hard but have a joke as a final boss (Contra series, Gradius series, Battletoads, etc...) or are rather easy all the way along but have a very damn impossible last boss (Mega Man 2, Mega Man X, Kirby's Adventure, etc...)<br /><br />And about Castlevania, yes the 4 poins damage is really annoying. I sometimes have trouble to beat Frankenstein too, but this is doable if you have luck. However beat the daeath is realy realy hard if you don't have the holy water, wich is not present in the last section before it. I think I once almost beat him without cheating, but I finally just lost (that's my best score to CV1 ever). With holy water I've heard the death is a joke but it's very hard to still have holy water there, an if you mess up one time it's over.<br /><br />PS : Oh one last thing. Did anyone notice how Squenix dratiscally reducted the difficulty in FF1&amp;2 Dawn of souls and FF4,5,6 Advance ?? That's a true crime to their original counterparts !<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Dec 08, 2007 2:10 pm</p><hr />

In Castlevania, the two most ANNOYING bosses in the game are definitely Death and Igor/Frankenstein. I HATE Igor. It's not just him, it's those STUPID dragon snake things before him. Whoever decided that all enemies in later levels do 4 bars of damage needed to not do that. Sometimes I wish the NES had a Save State function, because I would use it before death and I would come equipped with the "III" thing that lets you do 3 subweapons, and I would have the axes. Everyone says that the best weapon to use against Death is the cross, but I think the axes are a lot better.<br /><br />The boss of Mega Man X is really annoying if you lose, because you have to fight that stupid dog again. And also, fill up your energy tanks with the worm things coming out of the pipes.<br /><br />I've never reached the boss of Mega Man 1, so I can't be of much help.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat Dec 08, 2007 12:19 pm</p><hr />
