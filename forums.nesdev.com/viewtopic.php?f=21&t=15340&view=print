Could such an exhaustive list be made ? Or is the number of technique just too long for that to be possible ?<br /><br />Pre-rendering something that looks 3D is a special case so it would be just once part of the list.

The first is the rotating rectangular cube. I have no idea at all how this is done.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://youtu.be/eQ-OcS2Gwvk?t=56">https://youtu.be/eQ-OcS2Gwvk?t=56</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The other one I like a lot is the blitter object towards the end.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://youtu.be/eQ-OcS2Gwvk?t=105">https://youtu.be/eQ-OcS2Gwvk?t=105</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Which I kind of vaguely am trying to replicate in a super simple way but haven't got very far yet.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The rotating cube at 0:56 is a mix of the vertical stretching used in <em>Rad Racer</em> and the CHR ROM-based texture mapping used in <em>Cosmic Epsilon</em>: each texture is stored at each width, and then for each scanline, timed code changes the Y scroll position to bring the appropriate row of the texture into view. This vertical stretching works on an NES but would have to be done all in software on a Master System.<br /><br />The rotating dots at 1:45 are just a 3D transformation applied to each vertex. A couple tricks are possible: using orthographic projection so as not to have to divide by Z, and interpolation of frames so as not to need to perform the full transformation on all points each frame.<br /><br />The Kefrens ribbons at 2:15 are two adjacent columns of the nametable rewritten during hblank, then a scroll change to reset the scroll to the top of the screen.

Sprites seem like there would be too many for some rotations (&quot;seem&quot;), and there's too much text for IT to be sprites.<br /><br />But, the bright text also makes it easier for sprites to be seamlessly dropped when that situation would arise…

Like, that's basically the same as &quot;real&quot; 3D stuff except your drawing primitive is a sprite at a point, instead of rasterized triangles. (Point sprites are also a type of primitive on modern 3D hardware, BTW, mostly used for particle explosions and stuff.)<br /><br />You could probably make a big category just for SNES techniques owing to Mode 7 or other stuff that's specific to it. It had pretty good sprite coverage too, so it could do some of the point sprite 3D techniques.<br /><br /><br />There's also a bunch of demoscene stuff. Rubber-cube via raster effects, copper bars, infinite bobs, etc. but a lot of these are of pretty limited/specific application.

A raycaster like Id Tech 0 in <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em> produces a 1-pixel-tall Z buffer, against which scaled sprites near each ray are rendered back to front. A portal caster like Build in <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em> works similarly, drawing sprites that are in or near each rendered room.<br /><br />Where does stereoscopy (red-blue anaglyph, alternate frame, polarized) fit into the ranking of goalposts?
