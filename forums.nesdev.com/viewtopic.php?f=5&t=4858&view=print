		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />- It won't be a great game. I bet the review scores won't go greater than 7.5 or even "editor's choice" seal. The reason? Well, I watched a lot of videos and took a quick analysis on gameplay, specially controls. You know, there's no problem on PS3 controls, right? What about the XBOX 360 controller? Supposedly, it was designed for 3D-like games, as racing and first person shooters (try to play MegaMan9 to see what I mean, and Halo 3 later).
<br />
<br />- The game looks like a perfect mix of Street Fighter EX series with a (re)touch of Street Fighter 3 (1st version). I don't mind about cartoon-ish graphics or shading effects - the gameplay is all. I still love to play the SF games on Playstation2, as Hyper Street Fighter II or Street Fighter III, or even the classic on SuperNES. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />- Anyway, the most recent SF on XBOX Live looks like "a fighting game made in Flash". They have replaced the backgrounds, but NOT resized them to match the 16:9 aspect. Instead, there's an option to zoom it (!), and someone from capcom-unity said that "only the original character sprites are avaliable, backgrounds would be a problem". I wonder how...
<br />
<br />- What's your bet for this game?

<br />
<br />But if you look at Capcom recent offering.. Not much new.  Old titles with a new look on it.  I tried the Biohazard 5 demo and didn't get into it at all.  So you're either a blinded fanboy of their games or not I guess.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I guess you were wrong about the score.  It's higher than you expected.
<br />
<br />I played the game and it's good.   I'm no SF fanboy, just like to play a fighting game once it a while and the game is good enough. Just not easy to play with a gamepad.
<br />
<br />Graphics are nice, just don't know why they tried to do an anime tie-in with the game movies for the story. I think they should have used the in-game engine instead.
<br />
<br />The only "disappointing" part is that usually capcom make their game multilingual from the get go (ex: devil may cry 4) but not this time.  So all the menu and text are in japanese.
<br />
<br />As for the bonus anime dvd, it seems to be based on the same anime we see for the introduction/ending of every character.  Didn't have time to watch it.  Maybe it will come in the US with the collector edition.

<br />Yup, I see the sales blowing up to 80k copies in the release day. What's important is the replay value - MegaMan9 was awesome in early days... no more, as I'm enough of it. The NES versions are still enjoyable, unlike the 9.

<br />Super Mario Bros. 2/Super Mario USA would like to have a word with you. It's better than both the game it was based on (Doki Doki Panic) <strong>and</strong> the game it was substituted for (SMB2J)!
<br />
<br />(sorry, I just have a really soft spot for this game...)

<br />Don't you mean "the game it was a substitute for" or "the game it substituted"? AFAIK, the game came after SMB2J.

<br />
<br />Come on, SMB2 wasn't a Mario game after all. SMB3 yes, and the others. Anyway, it's subjective - I prefer japanese versions, except for the language barrier, obviously. RockmanX6 is an example. Street Fighter II is another - they replaced M.Bison (Mike Bison) in order to avoid Mike Tyson similarity? So, Vega has become Balrog (spanished, eh) and the rest you know.
