I hate the Interlacing artifacts introduced by Plasma TVs.  It destroys the "earthquake" effects used by some games, such as Secret of Mana.<br /><br />The NES and SNES were designed to have a glorious 240p image, not the 480i that new TVs give it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Mon Dec 27, 2010 7:00 am</p><hr />

When converting composite, S-Video, or interlaced component to progressive video, a smart upscaler delays the signal by a few fields to determine whether to bob (interpolate between lines), weave (hold half the scanlines from the past field), use a weighted combination of the two, or hold and weave, on each part of the image. Bob is better for fast motion, while weave is better for still images, and hold and weave is better for originally-progressive sources such as film. Some CRT TVs, especially early HDTV monitors, are designed for 480p and 1080i scan rates and convert 480i to 480p.<br /><br />Converting progressive video, on the other hand, can in theory be done immediately as soon as the following scanline has been read, for less than 1 ms latency. (The "5 ms" is the time to go from black to white, or light gray to dark gray, or blue to yellow, etc.) But the upscalers in most HDTVs are designed for antenna TV, analog cable, digital cable, satellite TV, DVD players, and post-Dreamcast video game consoles, not classic 240p consoles, so they don't have a special mode for 240p input.<br /><br />PC-based emulators don't race the beam. Instead, they render a whole frame and send it to the display, lagging it by one field. In general, the total emulation lag is competitive with DTV upscaling lag.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Dec 26, 2010 11:24 pm</p><hr />

I had heard something like there being a fixed delay when converting to the newer display format, is that true (and/or noticeable)?<br /><br />Fighting Mike Tyson is hard enough as it is without any display lag.  My only LCD is my PC monitor, so I don't know.  My only complaint with my LCD is that scrolling game backgrounds look like crap on it whenever you move.  It has a 5ms response time though, I'm sure faster ones look better.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Dec 26, 2010 11:19 pm</p><hr />

I can play Battletoads just fine with my LCD, and it is a standard Samsung one my dad bought about 1 year ago.<br /><br />You just had to find an option so that it blends colors together, if you don't it will look ugly as every artifact on color changes will be very noticeable.<br /><br />The only issue is flickering graphics - the TV "belive" it's interlaced and display horizontal lines instead of displaying a flickering image. That actually makes sprite cycling looks better in some games, but for example the airship's shadow in Final Fantasy III is made of horizontal dashes instead of a flickering solid shadow.<br /><br />Hironically, it's a couple of "modern" PS2 games that suffers the most from the CRT-&gt;LCD transition.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Dec 25, 2010 5:05 am</p><hr />

So the Television that I've been using for my NES needs is dying (flickering/color loss).  I'll be using a smaller CRT for now, but it's definitely not nearly as nice.<br /><br />What I'd like to know is are there LCD's (maybe plasma, but they run too big for where I need it) that have 0 ms.  This is critical to me since I play games that take absolutely precise timing in order to play correctly e.g. Battletoads, Punch Out!<br /><br />In short, do I need a CRT to get 0ms or are there alternatives?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4219">nothingnew</a> — Fri Dec 24, 2010 6:11 pm</p><hr />
