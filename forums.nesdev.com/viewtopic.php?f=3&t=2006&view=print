		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi
<br />
<br />I get Error #4 (Pattern B--B- (one even, one odd) should skip 1 clock)
<br />I can only about two things that it may depend on
<br />
<br />1. What iam doing is in wrong order...
<br />This is what my emulate-sequence look like:
<br />
<br />1. Call NMI (if enabled)
<br />2. Run 6820 PPU cycles (I don't have a CPU cycle counter, only PPU)
<br />3. Clear Status flags (vbl, spritehit, overflow)
<br />4. Add one cycle to the PPU clock if its an odd frame and BG enabled
<br />5. Set up sprites for the frame
<br />6. Run up to 89342 cycles
<br />
<br />2. if the cycle counter overflow I call the instruction anyway, is it important to first find out how many cycles the instruction will take, then call it if its enough time left?
<br />
<br />What happens if a 6 CPU cycle instruction appears at 89340, is it executed after NMI? In order to pass the timing tests is this important?
<br />
<br />thanks

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well.. What I need to know is:
<br />
<br />1. is NMI called in the beginning of a frame or at the end.
<br />2. is all instructions performed at its very last cycle, and like my earlier example, if half an instruction is executed before NMI is its "action" made directly after NMI in this case? is this true for all opcodes, CLI is different huh? but what about the others...
<br />
<br />Since I always let the instruction to be executed even if it should be right after NMI, may this cause errors in timing?

<br />
<br />some psuedo code might help.
<br />
<br />My way:
<br />
<br />do
<br />{
<br />RunNextOp();
<br />PPUClock += OpCycles();
<br />} while (PPUClock &lt; 89xxx)
<br />
<br />probably the right way:
<br />
<br />while (1)
<br />{
<br />PPUClock += OpCycles();
<br />if (PPUClock &lt; 89xxx)
<br />  RunNextOp();
<br />else
<br />{
<br />  // Find out how many cycles that are left of the current instruction and
<br />  // run it after NMI
<br />  break;
<br />}
<br />}

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />you might have a problem with the ppu cycle in the cpu instruction.  since the ppu is (ntsc) 3 times faster then the cpu, and the average cpu instruction is about 4 cycles long, that leaves 3 * 4 = 12 possible values to be read from if the cpu was reading a ppu register.  so are you rounding your reads and writes to the intruction boundary? or updating on the exact ppu cycle ?
<br />
<br />i have a cpu clock and a ppu clock.  i run the cpu till predicted nmi or irq.  and catch up the ppu where needed.  this works, i might change it alittle, but i think it will always be a catch-up.  and i dont lock mine to render frames because i might use the sound call back some day for timing.  and the sound call back might never line up with the render frame.
<br />
<br />also, i posted a while ago about save states.  i took that into consideration too.  so i can pause my emulation on a save frame.
<br />
<br />sucks that search is STILL broke, but there is alot of info in the old posts.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since the first two sub tests of 3.even_odd_frames.nes passed, it suggests something more subtle is going on. Test 2 keeps BG disabled the whole time, and passes. Test 3 enables BG for two consecutive frames, then disables it, and expects that only one PPU clock was skipped. Test 4, which fails, enabled BG for one frame, disables it for two, then enables it for one more frame, also expecting only one PPU clock to be skipped.
<br />
<br />Oh, wait, maybe I'm assuming too much again. Have you verified that 1.frame_basics.nes and 2.vbl_timing.nes both pass? Ugh.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah. both pass! But isnt it possible for example that you read the status register at PPU clock 89341 and I get error cause this read is finished before NMI or something like that.
<br />
<br />btw, do all instructions do their thing at its last cycle? if NMI is triggered inside an instruction, where is the programcounter? pointing to the instruction, the parameter, the next instruction or does it depend on how far the instruction have come (in cycles)?

<br />1: Read opcode

<br />3: Read high byte of address
<br />4: Read from $2002
<br />
<br />There's also a fifth cycle, but this is overlapped with the opcode fetch for the next instruction so it's usually ignored. The NMI and IRQ lines are checked during cycle 3 in the above example. If either is set, then the interrupt will occur after the instruction finishes, and the program counter saved on the stack will be for the next instruction.

<br />since the opcode is finished in the 3 or above case, do this mean that the opcode restarts if its less then 3?

<br />Is there a complete table of where NMI/IRQ checks are made for each op code?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />All interrupts occur between completely executed instructions; an instruction is never interrupted before completion. The saved program counter on the stack is where execution should continue once the interrupt has been handled. My tests indicate that it's always the second from last cycle of an instruction that the IRQ/NMI inputs are examined, or the next-to-last cycle if you're ignoring the final cycle that's overlapped with the opcode fetch of the next instruction. This checking is effectively two cycles before it takes effect, so if IRQ/NMI is asserted in the third cycle of LDA in the example above, then an interrupt will occur after LDA completes.
