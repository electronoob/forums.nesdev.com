For anybody that's played Mario where letting go of the A button means not jumping as high, as like in yours, it's not easy to adjust. I highly prefer it to not matter whether A is pressed, but instead if your pressing a direction into a wall will make you grab onto it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Tue Aug 23, 2011 11:05 am</p><hr />

I've tried several points vertically on that first wall to my right, I can't seem to then cling to the wall on the left, no matter how high or low I am. *edit* nevermind, I finally got it. Not sure why I didn't get it before, I think the timing of letting go of the A right before hitting the wall was more difficult going left than right for some reason. Maybe it should be modified so that you cling no matter what, but you have to release and then press A again to jump off? Might be easier/less frustrating.<br /><br />On the other hand, I think perhaps the area you can cling is what threw me off. I definitely was hitting the wall on the left without holding A, but it was maybe "too low" to cling. Is this by design that he can't cling with part of him hanging below the edge of the wall?<br /><br />I hope I'm not causing offense with that. I had no gripes with the play control in the first game, it was spot on. And, I'm finding with my own game that feedback like this can make a HUGE difference. Regardless, it is a small flaw. The game is looking great.<br /><br />*edit* Now that I know how to do it, I'm really not sure what was throwing me off before. I've seen this with my own game. What feels easy/normal to me cause I program it and play it all the time has caused frustration for my beta testers. On the other hand, Ninja Gaiden was frustrating the first time I played it. It may just be part of learning any NES platformer.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Tue Aug 23, 2011 9:29 am</p><hr />

The idea being to keep your thumb off the A button once you've jumped, that way your ready to either cling to a wall or double jump.  I could see it still working where you can still be holding A when clinging to a wall.
