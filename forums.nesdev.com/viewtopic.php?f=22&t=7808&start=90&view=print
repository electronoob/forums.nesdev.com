You need to stop rolling by pressing left and then jump at just the right moment so you touch the bunny without destroying it.

Even if I'm able to touch the bunny wihtout killing it the second invinciblity time doesn't even come close to last long enough to cross the second set of spikes, as your main character falls back to the lower set of spikes and I have to jump twice then cross them.<br /><br />I even tried remain at the bunny's place to get hit a 3rd time (even if this would kill any chances for me to pass the 3rd set of spikes), but even that didn't work as I always run out of times before jumping off the 2nd set of spikes.</div>
<br />
<br />I think it is just a matter of mastering the controls and repetition.  I got it on my first try yesterday.

<br />
<br />I'll have to repeat what others have already said... WOW! The best homebrew so far! Lots of unique features and enjoyable design. I really look forward to buying the final game. :D
<br />
<br />A few points of hopefully constructive criticism from my side:
<br />- I found it pretty annoying how hard it was to jump of a vine since you can't hold UP on the cursor while doing so. This should be fairly easy to fix by only letting the player grab a vine mid-air if up was (re-)pushed *after* jumping.
<br />
<br />- As Koitsu mentioned, the controls are somewhat frustrating at times. I understand you don't want to slow down the fluidity of the player, but how about making the acceleration from standing still just slightly slower? Right now I find it incredibly hard to move without falling down when standing on a single block.
<br />
<br />- Like others have mentioned, the game could use some more color and variation in the graphics :)
<br />
<br />- And last of all a minor point... I was really hoping to explore more of the game after aquiring the secret item, so I was kind of disappointed when I realized that beating the game the second tie with it seems to lock up the game eternally :/
<br />
<br />Other than that, congrats again for such a polished game!

<br />Where can that giant bat be found?  I've played through the demo a couple of time now, but haven't noticed any bat of abnormal size.
<br />
<br />Brilliant game, btw.

<br />I'm using a custom sound engine. All songs were composed at 150bpm in FamiTracker, but in theory, the engine does support different tempos. Me and the composer were worried about how they mess with note durations and instruments, but that won't hurt as much as a slower speed, I guess.

<br />Yep, I think it is very good homebrew.
<br />1 question-That Big bat...it just talk, nothing more?
<br />The 4 screen scrolling is very nice in NTSC, but in PAL there are some artifacts...will this be fixed in future?

<br />Not sure if I can fix the artifacts. They are kind of annoying in PAL, I agree, but compared to Ufouria, which uses the same mirroring setup for multi-directional scrolling, they are very tame.
<br />
<br />Moving the artifacts to the top of the screen when scrolling down and vice versa may be a better idea.

And that the screen vibrates. Also, the 4 way scrolling looks flawless, that's awesome. I get the feeling Kirby's Adventure is an inspiration to you. I loved the cute tiny little yellow bird helper guy.
