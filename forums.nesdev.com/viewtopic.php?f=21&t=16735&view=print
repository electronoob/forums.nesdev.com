Sadly this game never made it to the full commision but we did have a working prototype that was demoed to the Splatoon team.<br /><br />Initially the idea was to layer sprites so we could get more colours per character but the workflow was just too intense, what looks good in theory doesn't always make for the smartest route in a production pipeline. The idea of the game was to shoot ink on all the grey surfaces and colour them.<br /><br />Finally I can start to talk about this project and show some graphics from it. I took reference from the Splatoon artbook, the game on the WiiU, and some Amiibos we had.<br /><br />All of the following graphics are formatted to work an actual NES with colour and memory restrictions, animations were done in Aseprite, tile maps in NESscreen Tool.<br /><br />Inkling:<br />fall<br /><img src="http://hawkenking.com/client/images/inkling-fall.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />shoot<br /><img src="http://hawkenking.com/client/images/inkling-fire.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />idle<br /><img src="http://hawkenking.com/client/images/inkling-idle.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />jump<br /><img src="http://hawkenking.com/client/images/inkling-jump.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />run<br /><img src="http://hawkenking.com/client/images/inkling-run.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />transform<br /><img src="http://hawkenking.com/client/images/inkling-transform.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Squid:<br /><br />fall<br /><img src="http://hawkenking.com/client/images/squid-fall.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />idle<br /><img src="http://hawkenking.com/client/images/squid-idle.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />jump<br /><img src="http://hawkenking.com/client/images/squid-jump.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />walk<br /><img src="http://hawkenking.com/client/images/squid-kick.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />Level:<br /><img src="http://hawkenking.com/client/images/industrial%20test2%20overview.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />tilemap:<br /><img src="http://hawkenking.com/client/images/industrial.png" alt="Image" />

Still, a bit of a shame they didn't go ahead with it. <br /><br />It looks really nice. Some interesting gradient techniques used on the background, too.

	</div><br />The part of the floor that would be &quot;inkable&quot; would be 16 pixels wide and tall, as it would use its own palette (and is why the slope does not have a while line, unfortunately). However, this would probably take more than 256 tiles, (especially with different tiles for inked surfaces) which I think would severely limit your options on what mapper to chose. (MMC5 only? Hopefully not.) Additionally, while it's not too apparent in that shot, the perspective doesn't really make sense. However, the perspective on the Donkey Kong Country games never made any sense either, for example:<br /><br /><img src="https://www.spriters-resource.com/resources/sheets/42/44918.png" alt="Image" />

I don't know what it's called but there's a style of art where you combine multiple perspectives in the same drawing to make it more lively. Classic Japanese paintings often used something like that.<br /><br />In Zelda a Link Between Worlds they made it intentionally so that it looks like in A Link to the Past by having everything being slanted (something which may be seen when going into a wall) while the camera is placed straight from above.

The number of colors there is noticeably lacking compared to the rest of the level. (Color balance is too centered on light colors.) One thing I never realized until I got into SNES programming is how all the poles and the doorway in the foreground fall in line with the 8x8 tile grid so they can appear in front of the player. How did they get it to line up like this if it originated from a 3D scene? I imagine there was a significant amount of editing done by hand afterward, but this is a given due to how the perspective doesn't make sense yet all the tiles have no visual breaks between them.<br /><br />(I noticed these posts after my other one:)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">You could still drop any IP related content</div><br />The beautifully animated Inkling is the best part though. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Pokun wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do you know how the game was going to be used?

Theres a few NES games that use this quirky double perspective isn't there?<br /><br />For the gameplay, one has to get away from the idea of painting the floor, and make it about painting the walls, then using the walls to traverse to higher parts of the level. The tile colouring was intended to use a sprite overlay that dripped ink on the tile. (we never got this far though)
