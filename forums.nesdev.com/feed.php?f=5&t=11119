I mean that an optimizer run on what is essentially an &quot;unrolled&quot; emulation of a program should perform significantly better than the equivalent emulator. Whether or not the compiler can do optimizations has nothing to do with &quot;normal&quot; code, machine generated code can optimize well or poorly, and the generator can be tuned to create well-optimizing code if you know enough about the compiler it's going to feed.<br /><br />I actually maintained a code generator in this way on my last job; it was an interesting experience. Occasionally you do get unlucky and your first approach generates worst-case code for the compiler, but you can fix this if you're paying attention. A lot of the time you get to watch large chunks of generated code just evaporate in the optimization step.<br /><br />There is not really any hope of recovering the original assembly via a normal compiler, but why would you be compiling back to 6502? My statement about efficiency was not a comparison to well crafted assembly.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Thu Mar 27, 2014 6:12 am</p><hr />

I am currently working on an NES game by writing it in C++ for PC with the NES limitations in mind, then manually porting the code to NES assembly once I have finished iterating on the C++ version. I find it insanely easier to make iterations and changes to C++ code vs assembly, so I think there would be a lot lost by doing primary development in assembly.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Wed Mar 26, 2014 3:40 pm</p><hr />

I'm kind of amused at the idea of throwing a C compiler—which theoretically has a code optimizer that's all about fixing code to be fast instead of understandable—and repurposing it to do static recompilation.<br /><br />I'm a little concerned that older ISAs with their paucity of first-class registers, and with having to emulate smaller register sizes, won't translate well; theoretically this is something currently fixed with hardware-level register renaming instead of a higher-level software solution.<br /><br />The Microchess example is a good data point for this purpose, though: e.g. the STRATGY function was 55 lines of 6502 and approximately 110 bytes, becomes 185 lines of x86_64 and approximately 680 bytes.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Wed Mar 26, 2014 11:47 am</p><hr />

While it's usually always possible to translate source code from a language to another automatically, the result will usually suck and be unusable, just like machine translation of a human language.<br /><br />I don't really get the point, if you want to get high quality source code that is understandable and maintenable to some extent you'll have to translate manually anyways. And if you don't want this, why translate in the 1st place ? It's probably much easier / makes more sense to interpret the 1st language in a source code written in the 2nd language.<br /><br />PS : What I said doesn't apply to high level langauge -&gt; assembly/binary translation which is compilation, but applies to all other kind of translations.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Mar 26, 2014 10:54 am</p><hr />
