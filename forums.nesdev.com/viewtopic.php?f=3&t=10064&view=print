For example:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The linear counter control will silence the channel after a specified time with a resolution of 240Hz in NTSC (see frame counter below). It shares a control bit with the length counter in $4008, which means that they are always enabled at the same time, and whichever is longer is redundant. See APU Triangle for more linear counter details.</div><br /><br />Does this mean that if C (&quot;length counter disable/linear counter control&quot;) is clear, then <em>both</em> the length counter and the linear counter will be counting down, while C being set means they're both halted? (In that case, calling it something like &quot;length counter halt/linear counter halt&quot; might be clearer.)<br /><br />Also, <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/APU_Triangle">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/APU_Triangle</a><!-- m --> mentions a &quot;halt&quot; flag (which I assume is different from the length counter halt flag). Is the only purpose of this (possibly abstract) flag to determine when the linear counter gets reloaded, or does it affect output as well? If it's the former, then &quot;halt&quot; seems like a confusing name.<br /><br />(I guess internally it might be some set-to-0-then-wrap-around-to-reload-value thing instead of a &quot;halt&quot; flag...)

It corresponds to a real hardware function of some sort, but I have no idea how it's actually implemented. I dunno what the best name for these things is, I've just left it as is when making revisions to the wiki. Control seems an okay name for the bit, especially since there's that layer of indirection (represented by the internal &quot;halt&quot; flag).

It doesn't directly affect linear counter operation, only the halt flag.<br /><br />The halt flag in the linear counter stops the counter from decrementing when it's set. And yes, it also affects when the linear counter is reloaded.<br /><br />I probably chose the name &quot;halt&quot; because it's one word. It's really a mode flag, telling whether the linear counter is reloaded or decremented on linear clocks. We could call it a mode flag, with the two modes named:<br /><br />* <em>linear mode</em> can be in one of two states: <em>reloading</em> or <em>counting</em>.<br />* Writing to $400B sets <em>linear mode</em> to <em>reloading</em>.<br />* When the frame counter generates a linear counter clock, the following actions occur in order:<br />1. If <em>linear mode</em> = <em>reloading</em>, linear counter is reloaded with counter reload value from $4008.<br />   If <em>linear mode</em> = <em>counting</em> and linear counter &gt; 0, linear counter is decremented.<br />2. If bit 7 of $4008 is clear, <em>linear mode</em> is set to <em>counting</em>.<br /><br />Bring on critique round two and let's refine this more!

It's a bit more verbose, but &quot;halt&quot; is easy to confuse with the length counter halt flag, and might also give you the idea that it halts the waveform generator.<br /><br />Edit: &quot;linear counter setup flag&quot; or &quot;linear counter load flag&quot; might be even better.

For the length counter, it determines when the counter counts down, while for the linear counter, it determines when the counter <em>starts</em> to count down (i.e., there's no way to stop the linear counter once it has begun counting down).<br /><br />(I know that the control flag doesn't control those directly btw. Only its status at the length/linear frame counter clocks matters.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Forgetting the control flag for the moment, my main gripe is that there are two &quot;halt&quot; flags. I think renaming the one unique to the triangle channel to &quot;linear counter reload flag&quot; would be a good first step. (As blargg says you could also put it in terms of the linear counter being in either &quot;reload&quot; or &quot;counting&quot; mode.)<br /><br />For example, the following reads pretty naturally:<br /><br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>If the linear counter reload flag is set, the linear counter is reloaded with the counter reload value, otherwise if the linear counter is non-zero, it is decremented. </li><li>If the control flag is clear, the linear counter reload flag is cleared. </li></ol><br />I'll go ahead with that edit unless I see someone protest in a while. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
