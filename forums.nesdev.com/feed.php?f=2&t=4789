You are right I completely screwed up in my example. The actual thing should look more like that :<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">  lda Value<br />  sec<br />  sbc #$02<br />  cmp #$f0<br />  bcc _ok<br />  sbc #$10<br />_ok<br />  sta Value<br /></div><br />There, it removes 2 to value and ensure the result is never in $f0-$ff ranges, which is usefull for vertical scrolling on the NES for example. Tt really show of how usefull it is to have the carry to be handled how the 6502 does. If it did the other way I'd have to do something like :<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">  lda Value<br />  clc<br />  sbc #$05<br />  cmp #$f0<br />  bcc _ok<br />  clc<br />  sbc #$10<br />_ok<br />  sta Value</div><br />OK nothing too terrible, but the added clc removes all the elegancy of the code.<br />Also when doing an inverse substraction where for some reason you have the value being substracted in A and don't want to use temporary storage :<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">  jsr DoSomeCalculation<br />  eor #$ff<br />  sec<br />  adc Value<br />  sta Value       ;Value = Value-SomeCalculation</div><br />Here you see that in fact it's a substraction rather than an addition thanks to the "sec" opcode. It is quite elegant, but again it would be the same if it were handled the Intel/Zilog way.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Jan 30, 2009 2:43 am</p><hr />

Here's some GB-Z80 code that does the same, where carry is handled the opposite way. No less optimized:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">    ld  a,&#40;Value&#41;   ; a = byte at Value<br />    sub $05         ; a = a - $05<br />    jr  c,_ok       ; if carry, jump to _ok<br />    sub $10         ; a = a - $10<br />_ok ld  &#40;Value&#41;,a   ; byte at Value = a</div><br />If the 6502 did it the same way, you'd have<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">  lda Value<br />  clc<br />  sbc #$05<br />  bcs _ok<br />  sbc #$10<br />_ok<br />  sta Value</div><br />Also no less optimal.

CMP doesn't affect the V flag. Also, I think internally the 6502 never subtracts, and implements CMP by setting the carry and complementing (XORing with $FF) the operand before adding. SBC simply complements the operand before adding, which is why you must set the carry first, so that you get two's complement negation (complement then add one). This is why the carry is opposite of what you'd expect, and how it's done on other processors like the GB-Z80. So on them carry set after a CMP would mean the register is less than the operand, whereas it means greater or equal on the 6502.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Thu Jan 29, 2009 8:56 am</p><hr />

Yes, definitely 8-9 can't equal 7 in all existing bases.<br /><br />Here if you do something like that :<br />ldx #$08<br />cmp #$09<br /><br />The 6502 will internally substract 9 from 8, and the result will be $ff, because it's a 8-bit CPU. So you know the Z flag is clear ($ff is not zero), the C flag is clear (the substraction has done an underflow), and the N flag is set (because $ff is negative). The result $ff is of course discarded, but the flag remains. For some reason I never use the N flag after a cmp/cpx/cpy instruction because it's often not usefull in practice, there is most certainly cases where it is usefull but I haven't found any.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Jan 29, 2009 2:42 am</p><hr />

Thanks.<br /></div><br /><br /> First off, the Z flag and C flag are independent of each other in the compare operation. Either one or the other, or both will be set on the result of the compare.<br /><br /> To compare something, you take the difference between A and B. So compare is a straight forward subtraction. <br /><br /> You can think of the C flag the same as with normal math:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"> &#40;1&#41;6<br />   -9<br /> -----<br />    7 <br /></div> <br /> A carry <em>would</em> have been needed because 9 is larger than 6. In decimal math, you carry/borrow from the next place depending on the result. In the above example, the 'ones' place would have needed a 'borrow' from the 'tens' place. On the cpu, there is no negative number. Instead, it 'wraps'. $01-$ff=$02. $10-$11=$ff<br /><br /> X=9, memory=6. The result is 7. This result is thrown <span style="text-decoration: underline">away</span> and the flags are set/cleared accordingly. Which flags? The Z=0 was *cleared* because the result of the subtraction <em>didn't</em> end up being 0. The C flag was *set*  (C=1) because a borrow would have been needed. If a borrow was needed, then you know the number in register X is larger than in memory(or immediate or ZP - whatever the operand is).<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"> ldx #$08<br /> cpx #$09<br />                ;c=0, z=0<br /><br /> ldx #$08<br /> cpx #$09<br />               ;c=1, z=0<br /><br /> ldx #$09<br /> cpx #$09<br />              ;c=1,z=1<br /></div><br /> See that last one? You would think that C would be cleared because 9 is not larger than 9, so no borrow would have been needed. The explanation for this is a little complicated and not really necessary to understand for you to use it. It' easier just to remember that the C flag is also set if A=B or A-B=0. Looking at an example with branching makes it easy to understand.<br /><br /> <br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"> ldx #$08<br /> cpx #$09     ;c=0,z=0<br />*bcc less_than<br /> beq equal<br /> bcs equal_or_greater_than<br /><br /> <br /> ldx #$09<br /> cpx #$08    ;c=1, z=0<br /> bcc less_than<br /> beq equal<br />*bcs equal_or_greater_than<br /><br /><br /> ldx #$09<br /> cpx #$09    ;c=1,z=1<br /> bcc less_than<br />*beq equal<br /> bcs equal_or_greater_than<br /><br /></div> The * represents which branch is taken. If you don't know your conditional branchs, BCC = branch if carry is clear, BEQ = branch if zero is set, BCS = branch if carry is set. If the condition of a corresponding flag of a conditional branch is not met, the cpu 'falls' through to the next instruction.<br /><br />edit: updated.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3645">tomaitheous</a> — Wed Jan 28, 2009 6:44 pm</p><hr />

The carry flag is set if the value in X is greather or equal than the value in memory (ungisned), and clear if the value in X is smaller than the value in memory.<br /><br />Think as if "memory" was substracted from X as if it was a SBC opcode (also it doesn't substract one more even if C was set prior to the compare), but the resuls is discared, only the flags are taken over<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Jan 28, 2009 12:39 pm</p><hr />
