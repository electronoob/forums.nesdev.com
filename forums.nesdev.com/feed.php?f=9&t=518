From what I've gathered, it sounds like their original plan was IP realized by ASIC or FPGA due to their "enhancement" claims. It's pretty clear though that as of now, it'll just be a NOAC clone with wireless support so they can get this thing to the shelves.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Wed Aug 24, 2005 8:09 pm</p><hr />

It still does sound vague to me though.  I'd think any ASIC could be described as 'custom designed', I guess the real question is "by who?".<br /><br />There's slightly more info here:<br /><a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3143042" class="postlink">http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3143042</a><br /><br />There are 'NOAC's that add another graphics mode and other features.  I have some of the docs and manuals for one, saved somewhere.  If that's what they're using (I have no idea), I'm guessing it couldn't be much better than a usual clone (which often seem to have the sound wrong, at least).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Aug 24, 2005 8:07 pm</p><hr />

Personally, I think that the problems with the front-loading NES are overrated.  I have a SNES that was not taken care of and it has significant trouble playing games, and I have SNES carts that were not taken care of and they have trouble running on a working SNES.  My point is that if people mistreat a NEX or any other cart based console, it will have the same problems that a mistreated NES have.<br /><br />Somebody at digitpress is already having trouble getting some of their carts to even run.  How much you wanna bet it is because the carts are not taken care of?

When it can display every Codemasters and Rare game correctly and play the audio correctly, then it will be a truly worthy product.  Until then its just another clone.<br /><br />Even my NeoFami can play Battletoads properly, I think.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> — Wed Aug 24, 2005 3:49 pm</p><hr />

I agree with the other posters in this thread.  It's a cool case, and not the worst idea in the world, but unlikely to be accurate enough for most of us.  They apparently are doing their own PPU, and not using the "NES on a Chip" that the other famiclones are using, which could be a good thing.  However, I wouldn't hold my breath for it to be accurate enough to run some of the more difficult carts, or to display the colors properly.  Personally I'm hoping the FPGA-NES (Kevtendo) gets off the ground with regards to production.  KH is a long standing and well respected NES hacker, and I trust him to do the console correctly.  I won't pre-judge the Nexgen thing before it's even released, but I'm not expecting much out of it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29">teaguecl</a> — Wed Aug 24, 2005 2:32 pm</p><hr />

Currently, as things seem so far, it is yet another Famiclone.  It is not the first to have a 72-pin cart slot or NES controller ports.  It remains to be seen if it is worth more than another Famiclone known as the Neofami, which can be had for around $25 on Ebay.  Personally, I don't see what the problem is with getting a refurbished toaster NES, or if you are really cheap, refurbish one yourself.  Famiclones tend to be crap for many reasons.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=94">Jagasian</a> — Wed Aug 24, 2005 1:27 pm</p><hr />
