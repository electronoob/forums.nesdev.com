		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have some 27cxxx chips that I would like to erase. Recently I came across some breakfast cerial thing.. where you get a free UV light pen. The pen writes in special ink and then on the otherside there's a UV light which you can shine on the writing to see it.
<br />
<br />Anyway, enough rambling, my question is, if I hook up the light (it's as big as a NES LED or a tiny bit bigger) to a constant DC power circuit and have it directly over the EPROM in a dark room, is it likely to erase the EPROM? I can get more than one to create an array if need be. It would be a good cheap way to make one, and it doesn't seem as dangerous as the other EPROM erasers out there.

<br />Yeah, this won't work at all.  EPROM's need UV at around 275nm to erase them, and they need a fairly high dose too.  Those LEDs output near-UV at around 395-405nm, which is way too long to do anything.
<br />
<br />Exposing EPROMs to sunlight doesn't work either... well, it CAN work but it takes a really long time... the equivelant of weeks of noontime tropical sun.  
<br />
<br />Don't even think about using a "blacklight" bulb or tube- those won't work either since the UV they output is similar to that from the LEDs.
<br />
<br />Long story short, you should probably just buy an EPROM eraser.  It's the easiest way to get the right kind of UV.    Note that this short wave UV that is required is very dangerous to exposed skin and eyes, and will give severe sunburns and nearly instant eye damage.

<br />This was a previous thread about the same subject. My Eprom eraser is just a bare bulb and a fixture about $25 altogether. Of course you shouldn't stare at it while it is on but routine caution should prevent burns. I stay out of the room or cover it while it is on. In hospitals where I work they have sterilizing lights which must be UVC and they are on all the time. However I don't recommend exposing yourself.
