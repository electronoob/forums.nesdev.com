<br />
<br />I just quick-read them, but they look like very well written.
<br />I'm sure I'm going to discover a few unknow gems among the games you lists (when I'll have the time). Shadow of the Ninja looks prettty damn cool and I haven't heard of this title before.
<br />
<br />I have to agree though that it's really weird a pirated chineese SMW game made it on the list. I haven't tried it, and graphically it looks amazing (well it's just ripped SNES graphics but I'm surprised how well it works), but I bet the gameply is crappy, as with all chineese pirated games I've ever played.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />With all due respect, you shouldn't bash something until you have personal experience with it. As you astutely surmised, I underwent extensive backgroun playtesting to determine which games would make the list and which would only be honorable mentions. I more I played Super Mario World pirate the more I realized it isn't nearly as shotty as I would have thought, and it's not only rather good among pirates, but also the entire library at large.
<br />
<br />The Super Mario World pirate is rather incredible as far as Hong Kong Originals go. It may only be 28 stages to the Mario World's what, 96? But still, it shows a huge effort on the Chinese pirates. Even though its a backport, everything had to be created from the ground  up which is quite a feat. 
<br />
<br />It does have a flaw with the physics engine that causes mario to come to a sudden stop when you jump from full speed, but can be corrected with a simple 1 line GameGenie code.
<br />
<br />So yeah. I urge you guys to try playing it first (with the GG code to fix the running bug). I think you'll find it's a lot better than you'd initially think.

<br />Will any Dizzy game make it into the list?

<br />
<br />The problem is as I stated on the offset, that the NES library is so massive that to narrow it down to just 100 means that there's a lot of really good games that don't get picked only because there's no room for them after my personal preferences. If your favorite NES game doesn't make it to the top 100, all it means is that I don't have enough of a personal connection with it to put it in the list.

Even though it sounds a little like an Adlib card, it is actually wavetable synthesis with a 64-sample wave.  It also supports vibrato and sweep envelopes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Vibrato is technically frequency modulation, but it's not frequency modulation synthesis because the modulator runs at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-frequency_oscillation" class="postlink">low frequency (LFO)</a>, not audio frequency like in the Yamaha OPL/OPN chips. Hardware vibrato might be responsible for the confusion between the Game Boy/PC Engine style wavetable channel in the FDS and proper Yamaha style FM synthesis.
