		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Unfortunately all the chips inside are globtops except for the ram.  Looks like there are two separate chips for the cpu and ppu but no markings.  Very compact inside with the wireless/audio/video taking up about as much space as the power/cpu board.  
<br />
<br />I would say video quality is in between front loader RF and RCA.  Good colors but lots of smearing.  Also some artifacts from the last row of pixels of white text on SMB1, could be something with the scrolling switch.
<br />
<br />Audio seems higher pitched, collecting coins in SMB1 sounds different.  There is stereo audio coming out of the box but no information on their website about how to program for it.
<br />
<br />Wireless can be turned on/off from a switch on the side, has to be off to use Four Score which fits well in the ports.  There are also "Charging Ports" in the back to charge the wireless controllers(?).
<br />
<br />Havent tested many games yet, any good suggestions?

It was able to show the opening of Castlevania 3 (but hung) and start up Gauntlet and Rad Racer (but the graphics glitches made those games unplayable.)  Try a few Codemasters games for some incompatible fun.  It just goes to show that it takes a truly serious effort to replicate any console.

<br />Yeah, sounds like they didn't hook the "CIRAM /CE" line up and PPU /A13 to the cart port, but instead connected those internally.  They must not have known you had to do this for NES carts (though you still do for fami carts).  
<br />
<br />This would prevent 4 screen games working, and it would prevent Afterburner working, 'cause afterburner disables it to do hardware nametables for the tile animation they do.   So that explains Gauntlet, Rad Racer (4 screen) and afterburner (HW nametables).  The other carts are MMC5, so the MMC5 is probably freaking out 'cause it has to synch with the PPU somehow to do i.e. IRQs.   Soo, I'm guessing without that line on the cart, the PPU can't synch up, so it will not perform interrupts.  Without this, some games may start, but will crash or hang without interrupts.  
<br />
<br />It might be possible to go inside the case and wire these 2 pins up to the NES on a chip in there to fix it.  I'd have to see a pic of the guts though.  Anyone wanna take a picture and post it somewhere?  (note: should be fairly high resolution so I can see details).

Maybe instead of assuming that no cartridge used the lines, they should have tried connecting them when they were testing these cartridges, if they ever tested them at all.

<br />
<br />If they hooked the lines to the Famicom connector, then it is likely that these games would work if connected to a 60-72 Pin Converter, like the sort Lik Sang sell.  How ironic would that be?

<br />SMB3:  Some sounds pitches are way off.  Mario's jump is a lot lower, etc.
<br />
<br />Kirby:  The DPCM channels are overdriven and whenever they are active, the other channels are quiet.

<br />Overall, it seems to be crap.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

People have been posting compatibility issues, impressions, etc of the system.  As well as participating in an on-going dispute over how Messiah mislead people with regards to the NEX and not being up front about incompatibility issues.  DreamTR posted an official link, finally, listing compatibility with NES games.  Note that even if a game has significant graphical glitches when played on a NEX, it is still listed as working  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />   I guess they've gotta keep that compatibility percentile inflated?
<br />
<br />I called shenanigans when they wouldn't comment on whether a game was compatible or not, even when they started taking pre-orders and shipping the system.  Compare this to kevtris's FPGA NES, where he is very open about what does work correctly and what has issues.  They should have paid kevtris to design a proper clone  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  Maybe they will make a NEX 2.0, ala the Flashback 2.0, and next time around not base the system on a shite NOAC.  (yes I will keep dreaming)

Pictures probably arent high res enough to do signal traces.
<br />
<br />While checking out the connections I noticed some of the famicom port pins are not correct according to <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/fam_pinout.txt">http://nesdev.com/fam_pinout.txt</a><!-- m -->  Mainly pin 16 isnt connected to ground, and pins 45/46 arent connected to each other.  Dont know if that will affect any games...
<br />
<br />The PPU /A13 on the NES connector is wired to the PPU glob and also to the wireless board and labelled as "mode".  Used as a clock signal?
<br />
<br />The CIRAM /CE pin on the NES connector is connected to a ground plane on the main board.  The CIRAM /CE pin on the Famicom connector is connected to the same ground plane.   I suspected the problem with Rad Racer II was a short somewhere, which is confirmed because it connects CIRAM /CE directly to power and the NEX connects it directly to ground.  Cutting the wire makes Rad Racer II display a green screen instead of no power light.  The NEX uses only one sram chip for wram and vram, with the /CS line as an output of some lsi logic.  Separating the CPU and PPU sram control lines should show where to reconnect the cart CIRAM /CE, but that will take more signal tracing on another day...

<br />
<br />Pins 45 and 46 are Audio IN/OUT - on most cartridges, these lines get tied together, but on MMC5/VRC6/Namco106/etc. cartridges, both of these lines go to the mapper. As for pin 16, the official Famicom schematic lists this pin as GND, so I'm not sure what's going on with this one...
