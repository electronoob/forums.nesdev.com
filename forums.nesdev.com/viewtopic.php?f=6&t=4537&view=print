This is not really an official release, as Plug Man, Jewel Man, Final Boss, and a few minor songs aren't done yet, but I'm not sure I'll do Plug/Jewel mans since 1) i can't think of anything to do for them, and 2) I actually like the originals anyway.
<br />
<br />This project is basically a "what if i wrote the music for Mega Man 9" idea.  
<br />
<br />These NSFs are all I have left of the project right now.  Ones that are slightly older copies of songs that got lost will have an asterisk next to them.

<br />enjoy...  i still plan on doing final boss, possibly finishing plug/jewel, and definitely finishing small themes (like stage select and wily castle intro).

<br />
<br />Well not really "recreated," more like a "what if I had been given the task of writing music with these themes" kind of idea.
<br />
<br />Quite a few of these were written before the game was released.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's really cool, however I have to say that the music really doesn't have that Mega Man feel to it. The soundtrack sounds more like something that Konami would put out than Capcom, which really isn't a bad thing.
<br />
<br />I made a mistake when I was making my own variation of the Mega Man boss selection theme, that I sort of noticed you made as well. Mega Man 2's boss selection theme has a "doodoot dodoo doooo.. dododoot dodoo dooo" going on, where it should be "dododoot" both times, the first time only has two notes because the first note is cut off by the "boss selected" sound effect" Very odd, I think. However MM9 got it right when it "remade" the song.
<br />
<br />Anyway, good job on the music, enjoyed listening to it all!

<br />
<br />I have to admit that the triangle taking the lead at :32 in, followed by a neat duty-cycling effect at :37 (an effect that was never used in any mega man music if I recall correctly) doesn't sound very Mega Man-y to me. It sounds like Rushjet1 to me and I LOVE it.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Although I'd like to add that any moments that 'don't sound' Mega Man like to me, is just me being as hairsplitting as possible. Of a lot of nsf composers out there I'd nominate some of your stuff as pulling off the most Mega Man-like sound I've heard.

<br />
<br />Not really, the thing is that if I were to make a new Mega Man soundtrack for NES (like this one), I'd kind of combine old with new, which is what I was going for.  I didn't like that the real MM9 soundtrack <em>only</em> used old instruments to do its stuff mostly, but then for a couple parts (like wily final boss, some stuff in jewel man with <em>really</em> weird high notes) it sounded nothing like Mega Man.  I tried to make it a bit less jagged than that.. I mean every Mega Man game had its own style and the music changed over the years (MM6 sounds nothing like MM2 to me).  So when you say that there are moments that don't sound like Mega Man to you and that you're being nitpicky, you really aren't <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I could list off a few, like the second half of tornado man, part of galaxy man you mentioned, concrete man itself (teckkkkno), etc.
<br />
<br />As for the progress of this, since I recovered the files, I've done lots of touch-up work on most songs, and I've changed a couple parts that seemed awkward... more to come later.
