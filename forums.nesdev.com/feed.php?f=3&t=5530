It is hard to guess what is wrong, since there is no source to show, and if the mario works up until the end of the game, then b0rks, there is a high chance that the error is somewhere else rather than basic joypad reading. I would double check nestest.nes or other cpu tests to see if you got all the CPU behavior right. Check if the sprite hit is correct, but I assume it would be to a point, since it can play it all the way to the end. I am not certain if mario uses the frame counter to trigger a interrupt in the CPU, I never got to the end of mario before I got the APU working. Check writes to the frame counter registers would be a good idea, since you said you haven't done the sound yet. There exists a full mario assembly, maybe you can check that and see. For the sound, I think this is a good thread to read, <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=69&amp;highlight=bandlimited+synthesis">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopi ... +synthesis</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3551">qeed</a> — Sat Aug 29, 2009 5:32 am</p><hr />

Hello everyone,<br /><br />This is strange question to ask especially since you haven't seen my code. But I'm hoping that perhaps someone experienced it before in the past and might point where I should look for a problem.<br /><br />I finished my emulator (no sound support yet) to a point that can play Super Mario Bros (the first one) as far as I know it emulates correctly up to level 8-2 (where I died <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />. Everything works fine, until I die, after that none of the keys appear to work.<br /><br />I added debugging output and it shows that the event handler handles the keys. Also when I reset the game the game starts accepting the keys.<br /><br />Any idea where the problem might be? It's possible that I missed something and am not emulating it.<br /><br />This is perhaps topic for another thread. I'm planning to add sound support, since I never did any programming with sound before I'm not sure where to start, any advice? I feel also that sound is not as well documented as other parts of emulation (or maybe it's just my lack of experience in that area)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4029">takeda</a> — Thu Aug 27, 2009 8:20 pm</p><hr />
