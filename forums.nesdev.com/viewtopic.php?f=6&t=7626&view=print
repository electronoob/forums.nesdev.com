<br />
<br />Turns out, it's a Sculptured Software music driver since the same driver appears in almost all of their games (found via binary search against all NES roms).
<br />
<br />Some of the A52 music is from "Music Construction Set" demo tunes as was previously discussed and were written by Ed Bogas, including the Cheetahmen music.
<br />
<br />Anyways I might as well release it instead of letting it fester on the HD.

<br />Whoops, I might've posted this a few years ago.  I honestly can't remember. Someone asked about it on IRC, so I figured it hadn't been posted yet.

<br />
<br />Anyway, a quick search reveals some names of staff at Sculptured Software:
<br /><strong>Paul Webb</strong> is credited as the musician and sound effects guy.
<br /><strong>Ken Moore, Ken Grant, Bill Williams, and Dwain Skinner</strong> have been credited as programmers for NES games developed by Sculptured Software.
<br />
<br />So then, who programmed the sound driver?
<br />
<br />edit again:
<br />
<br />Action 52, Eliminator Boat Duel, Monopoly, Metal Mech, and Day Dreamin' Davey seem to use this small snippet of code:

<br />Was the C64 version the only one that contains the music? I downloaded some version but it doesn't seem to have them. :/ Can you share the one you have? My e-mail is thefox at aspekt.fi.

<br />Paul Webb wrote the driver originally;  Doom94 told me that on IRC last night (he's the one that wanted the driver code and format spec).
<br />
<br />And yes that's most of the games I found too..  I searched for two 8-12 byte snippets of code.   When I get home and remember I will post the list of games I have.

Choice quote:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">In July 1993, Vince Perri wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The breakthrough came by accident. "I happened to see my son playing an illegal product made in Taiwan that had 40 games on it. The whole neighborhood went crazy over it," Perri said. "<strong>I figured I'd do it legally.</strong> It's obvious when you see something like that, you know there's something there."<br /><br />Perri said he used his overseas banking connections to raise $5 million from private backers in Europe and Saudi Arabia. <strong>He farmed out the programming to college students</strong> and the technical work to Cronos Engineering Inc., a Boca Raton company that does work for IBM Corp. He expects to begin shipping Action 52 today.</div>
<br />
<br />Sounds like someone pulled a fast one on Mr. Perri and it wasn't technically legal after all =P

<br />Is anything unquestionably legal? There are so many crimes and so many torts nowadays that you'd need to be an attorney to keep track of them all.

<br />I mean, rather than have every notes be two bytes (&lt;note&gt;&lt;length&gt;), I changed it so you specify the note length once, and it applies for all following notes until you specify a new one.

<br />Which is essentially the same thing as run length encoding the durations, if you think about it. It's just that I don't have several notes of the same duration in a row often enough to justify this; instead, I specify duration with three bits of the note command (and pitch with the other 5). But to each his own, I guess.
