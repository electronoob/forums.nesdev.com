The Super Gameboy works by using the SNES's DMA to copy those 6KB of data into the SNES's PPU.<br /><br />However, the GBC emits a <strong>15</strong>bpp stream, requiring <em>eight times</em> as much data to be transfered, and the SNES can't keep up.

I find it incredibly hard to believe that the N64 can't stream 4x the amount of data as the SNES.<br /><br />Anyway though, Would it be possible to actually just use the SNES's video hardware to emulate the GBC's instead of just sending a pre competed image? Oh, wait, the GBC has 32 palettes, 16 for sprites and 16 for BGs, doesn't it... I was about to suggest that you'd just use half of the bits for sprites, and use a 2bpp BG layer, but then I also remembered that color 0 on each BG palette is a unique color. At least with the BG though, you can layer 2 2bpp layers on top of each other, with one of the layers having tiles being a solid color (presumably any regular tile, just with all 4 entries in the palette being the same). Actually, you could still have the GBC BG layer on the SNES if you use all 4 2bpp layers in mode 0: have 2 BG layers, each for 8 palettes, and have the other 2 BG layers be the palettes of color 0. I'm still at a loss with sprites though, unless you want to have a &quot;copy&quot; of every 2bpp sprite graphic so that you can use the top 8 colors as an extra palette. I'm not sure how feasible this would be though. The BG should be fine though.
