<br />That depends on who you buy from. I used to have two NESs, so I sold the spare one a couple of years ago for about 350 SEK. I didn't include any games, but it came with all cables, one controller and an extra (new) 72-pin connector.

<br />
<br />- Meh, almost the same here, but the console unit only. I had to buy a terrible controller (missing name now) with a 360ยบ dpad, very odd. I bought such controller because... it was a sealed one. ^_^;; The NES console was manufactured here, and its condition is "good": MegaManIV doesn't work so easily due to the connector problem.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I actually was incredibly lucky once to get a boxed famicom for US $50. All the other ones on eBay were about $200-$300. I was kind of stupid to buy it though, as the person didn't have much feedback, and the price was shady. And I knew that was true when I emailed the person after like 2 weeks of not getting it, and they didn't respond, they deactivated their eBay account, and I was $50 poorer. But then one night six months later, I had a dream that the Famicom actually came in the mail, but then I woke up and realized it didn't really happen. To my shock, after I was done with work that day, I came back to see that it actually did come in the mail! I found that to be strange and mysterious... I was lucky to not be ripped off in the end, but never again will I buy something under those kinds of circumstances. That was just too risky.
<br />
<br />I actually have the NES my brothers got back in the late 80's/early 90's. That's actually the one that works the best, ironically. I also have another one that I bought for around $50 back in 2000 or so. That one had a crap connector, and I hardly use it for anything. I think I made it into a CopyNES (too bad I don't use it). The other NES I have was given to me, because this lady was going to throw it, and like 20 classic games away. I asked her if I could buy them from her, but she said I could just have them. It was awesome!

Personally my favourite version of the NES would probably be the toploading one - if I had ever seen one !
