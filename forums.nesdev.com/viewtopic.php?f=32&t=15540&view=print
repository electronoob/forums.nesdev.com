		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Multiplayer games are a strange beast. I played them with actual fellows which is definitely a lot of fun by itself. It has some serious potential to induce a bias when it comes to notation.<br /><br />On the other side, none of the three multiplayers entries propose anything for one player. For those who played single to evaluate entries, it seems to induce the opposite bias: there is nothing funny to do in these games.<br /><br />I am interested in knowing how you evaluated these games. Having myself submited a multiplayer-only game makes this issue more personal. Note that this thread is late on purpose, to not influence notation but just understand it when it comes <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

It's not as fun, because the AI is so stupid, but at least there's something to play and judge...<br /><br /><br />But you're right, it's hard to judge a multiplayer-only game with one person.  I don't have a good answer for you.

But like you said, it's chaotic enough that it works somewhat even though it's stupid.  But you rarely get to play the later phases, as it's hard to lose against that AI.
