You don't need to specify any arguments; just run &quot;build&quot; from within the directory where everything is.  You will find that assembly listings for most of the files are generated (.lst files).  <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">map.txt</tt> will contain a &quot;map&quot; of what memory (ROM) vs. file offset locations contain what &quot;segments&quot; of stuff (I found this extremely useful, as did tepples apparently).  Built object files (which the linker put together) are stored in the dir objs\.<br /><br />You can some of the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.proc</tt> routines into their own files if you wish, then make appropriate changes to the build.bat script.<br /><br />Two things to note, bugs which need to be fixed:<br /><br />1. Sprites do not appear.  Unsure why, did not investigate.<br />2. &quot;Main ship&quot; location appears incorrectly offset somehow; maybe BG X/Y offset issue?  Unsure why, did not investigate.<br /><br />Hope someone can delve into those + figure them out.  It's probably something obscure.  This was a &quot;fun&quot; learning experience in the sense that 80% of my time I spent cursing loudly.  &quot;Fun&quot;...<br /><br />I'm bowing out of this thread entirely at this point.  I've helped out as much as I think I can bear at this point.<br /><br />Footnote: I'm kinda disgusted how ca65 has no real concept of 65816 direct page (only 6502 zero page).  The best you can do is declare zero page in $0000-00ff and then the rest as BSS.  I kept rolling my eyes over this.  But hey, at least the assembler can generate sane listings.  :-)

I wonder how that happened. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> One thing I find peculiar about it is that BG1 vertical position (not BG0) has all 16 bits set, while the x position doesn't. (I guess there's a whole bunch of junk before all that doesn't effect anything, but it just stops right there) I still don't know what's up with the sprites, but moving around the d-pad doesn't effect them, which means it probably doesn't have to do with the metasprite routine, but the routine at the begging that puts them all off screen.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Edit: Oh, wait, I'm stupid.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A quick little discovery... I found that not transferring MapX and MapY to the BG scrolling register causes the BG to act normally, so there must be a problem with MapX and MapY. Did you move all the &quot;defined&quot; registers from their original positions? I guess MapX and Y already have a value loaded in them from something else, but it only gets loaded before the infinite loop, because it still scrolls like normally. Otherwise, the BG wouldn't move.<br /><br />Oh, and another thing. Oam is completely filled with #$55, which is kind of odd... (I made it to where I completely skipped the Medasprite routine and the SpriteInit, and nothing changed.) I got rid of the Oam uploading code, and it acted normally if you did that, having everything be #$00. I then though of the similarities between the BGs and sprites on my code and remembered that both are transferring data in NMI, so maybe the problem resides there? If someone, besides koitsu, would mind helping me, I would greatly appreciate it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />

The data that was getting uploaded to OAM was not the right place because Spritebuff1 was no longer a $0400, (it's now at $0200) so I changed any reference using $0400 to #Spritebuff1. The main problem here, however, is that for some reason, RAM is flooded with #$55 in a lot of places, including MapX and Y, and SpriteBuf1. I stored 0 is MapX and MapX+1 and also did the same thing for Y and the BG is now fixed. For the sprites, I made a loop where SpriteBuf1 is filled with 0's. (There is a 1 in the X position of each sprite to prevent a special bug or something.) This now causes a sprite to be on screen when you mess with SpriteBuf2, but it appears the metasprite routine isn't working properly, because everything appears in the upper left hand corner. You said it was messed up before hand, so switching the code with one that works (which I have since made) should fix it. My problem with this whole thing is knowing why wram is flooded with #$55 in many areas, even if I got it to work.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

Work is going to love me tomorrow.  *sigh*  But I figured while I was up dealing with dumb health problems, I might as well try to figure out the rest -- and I did, so sprites work now.<br /><br />I fixed/simplified your start_metasprite routine as well (I'm pretty sure it had bugs in it vs. what the comments claimed) + I clarified things in the comments.  The counting should make more sense to you now, but whether or not that's really how you want to implement it is up to you.  Honestly that routine would, I think, greatly benefit from indirect addressing (so you could have multiple metasprite tables, effectively, and change which one you're referring to by a single load/store pair -- yes really!).  I got rid of YTemp/XTemp too (once you see the changes you'll understand why).<br /><br />I also added a crappy something if you press/hold the Y button, just for sprite movement testing.<br /><br />There were other bugs/things I had to fix too but at this point I'm so tired and feeling so ugh that I can't remember.<br /><br />Your whole metasprite + sprite concept here seems very... I don't know.  I sort of get the impression you don't understand what SpriteBuf1/SpriteBuf2 do (meaning what they're for and how the SNES uses them), but there's a 50% chance I'm completely wrong and it's just that you haven't written the rest of the code but have designed it somewhere (in which case I apologise + ignore me).  But I now understand why you want to &quot;move to 16-bit&quot; -- because the MSB (9th bit) of the Y position of a sprite is separate from the remaining 8 bits.  I now actually understand what's needed to make all of that work, but I wish I had a better idea ultimately what your goal was.<br /><br />And 2input.asm is just... I don't even know what to do with that mess.  ;-)<br /><br />And this time I used .zip just to make Tepples happy (BTW the reason I used RAR: because Espozo did in his posts, so why you pickin' on me brah?  j/k).<br /><br />P.S. -- One of these days I wanna see what psychopathicteen has been working on for like the past 8 billion years.

So no, it's simply people being ridiculous and for some reason thinking that this one-time-called routine deserves loops and other nonsense (like &quot;don't bother initialising some registers because we set them in the near future anyway&quot; -- WHO CARES, do the init exactly like Nintendo says, do it one time, and stop worrying about the rest!)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'll look at the zipfile sometime today.</div><br />The latest version I posted is worse (formatting-wise) than the previous one, because I went back and started from scratch (thinking I had accidentally lost some code or changed something without fully testing each step of the way, thus causing the BG and sprite problems) and was doing a large amount of copy-pasting.  I also kept a lot of the original labels and variable names and filenames from Espozo's original code (while the better-formatted one I released with BG/sprite issues had some variables and labels and files renamed).
