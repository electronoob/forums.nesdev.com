How about editing the CHR-RAM and have 16K of RAM, Use one for the screen, edit the other and just edit the full page and just swap them ever 2 frames or something. Would that be an idea for making it possible? Using the background for the arrows, I don't know if you guys have shunned it yet but still, it's an idea. It would take a while to move the screen up one pixel though, thats alot of bytes.<br /><br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />How about 8K in the WRAM area and 8K to the grpahics, same idea, nearly the same image, just edits it there. It will edit the WRAM one so you don't have to go through the PPU to edit the CHR-RAM. I have never used CHR-RAM but I assume you go through the PPU which is alot harder and wasteful of cycles so it would seem better to do the 8K WRAM editing.<br /><br />Is there any game that swaps out 8K of RAM from CHR to WRAM and vice versa?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Thu Sep 16, 2010 7:34 pm</p><hr />

Another possibility is to leave the foreground arrows in one pattern table and the receptors in the other and switch between them as necessary. I'm sure that a combination of the above ideas would make this possible.<br /><br />EDIT: I also screwed up with that image.

Oh, so that's how an engine with charts on the background would work. It'd use vertical mirroring, with the chart on the first nametable and the receptors and fields on the second. That would need two splits, one below the receptors and one below the scrolling area, so it'd need either a scanline-counting mapper or no sampled drums, but I managed to produce passable covers of Butterfly and Maxx Unlimited without sampled drums.<br /><br />But you've used 144 tiles for the left arrow alone.

By the time the player is tackling 9-footers like Matsuri Japan and Rhythm and Police, the player will be used to fast scrolling in the light and standard charts of songs like Drop Out, The least 100 seconds, and Across the Nightmare, and thus is likely to pick 1.5x for songs in the 180-200 BPM range.<br /><br />But living in software patent country and dealing with a company that has shown itself to be willing to take infringers to court, I can't really work more on this until 2018.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Sep 16, 2010 8:23 am</p><hr />

For example, Donkey Kong for NES leaves out the &quot;cement pie factory&quot; stage, but that didn't elicit cries of &quot;<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/RuinedFOREVER" class="postlink">ruined forever</a>&quot;. I had to leave hold and multiple previews out of a previous puzzle game project due to control and palette issues, but I solved that by setting up the randomizer and scoring so that hold isn't needed to make a phat combo. This made it a good game in its own right. But leaving out preview entirely wasn't worth it, and neither was introducing unreasonable delays in line clearing (due to VRAM bandwidth issues) or making one player's piece flicker all the time (due to the OAM DRAM refresh glitch).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />force all players to play at a faster speed so they aren't required.<br /></div><br />The ends of both Afronova heavy and Max 300 heavy have double-taps 2/3 of a beat apart, which need 1.5x for no overlap. This results in 300 BPM for Afronova or 450 BPM for Max 300.<br /><br />Other songs have eighth-note double-taps. These include all Paranoias at all difficulties and the end of Maxx Unlimited standard. Avoiding overlap for eighth-note double-taps needs 2x, which is 360-400 BPM for the Paranoias or 600 BPM for Maxx Unlimited. Good luck expecting Player 3 who has chosen the Beginner or Light step chart to be able to read at that speed.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />This is a good idea anyway because you could go with the sprite option again, if less arrows need to be shown onscreen.<br /></div><br />A single jump for four players is 16 sprites (2 sprites per arrow * 2 arrows per player * 4 players).<br /><br />But you can't hook up four Power Pads or four Super NES controllers to an NES anyway. No arcade DDR game has had four pads, and the only console DDR games supporting that are DDR Ultramix series on Xbox. So the solution I'd probably adopt involves cutting down to 2 players, drawing arrows as sprites, and using the following sprite cycling scheme to handle the occasional tight overlap in step-jump combos and 16th note runs: Draw left halves of arrows in front in even frames and right halves in front in odd frames.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Sep 16, 2010 5:55 am</p><hr />

I don't see why you can't just avoid everything that causes a problem.  It's not meant to be a perfect port, it's meant to be DDR, which at its minimum is four arrows at the top and at least one arrow moving up the screen.<br /><br />Different colored arrows using up too many colors?  Use dithering patterns instead.<br /><br />Overlapping arrows an issue?  Don't include them.  Don't put any songs in the game that would need them, or force all players to play at a faster speed so they aren't required.  This is a good idea anyway because you could go with the sprite option again, if less arrows need to be shown onscreen.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3438">UncleSporky</a> — Thu Sep 16, 2010 5:24 am</p><hr />

The DDR 5th Mix engine ran at 60 fps. But it was Japan-exclusive because Konami of America wanted "solo" (6 panels on one pad) play, which was in the 4th Mix engine (used for Konamix) but not the 5th Mix engine.<br /><br />Back to the NES: To use the background plane for arrows, all players would have to use the same speed mod and no "boost" style mods, and the CHR would have to represent all possible combinations of overlapping arrows. Want to see a mock-up of what step charts with overlapping arrows would look like? And I still don't see how CHR with the arrows near the receptors would be organized.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Sep 16, 2010 4:54 am</p><hr />

The logic behind DDR games is so simple that even an Atari 2600 could do it at 60fps. Moving arrows up and checking if buttons are pressed at the correct times is way simpler than scrolling a level map while moving lots of creatures that interact with each other in a world with simulated physics, and the NES had a lot of games doing the latter running at 60fps.<br /><br />The only thing that could be slowing the game down in the ports you mentioned are the background visuals, but if this is the case it's pretty safe to say that it's not the console's fault, it's the developers of said ports who did a pretty bad job (either by not designing the visuals according to the system's capabilities or by not making proper use of them).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Sep 15, 2010 9:16 pm</p><hr />
