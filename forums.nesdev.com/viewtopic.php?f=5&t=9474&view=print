Controller 2 has no start or select, instead a microphone with a volume switch. On mine the microphone was removed or something, but useful only in a few games anyway and otherwise just pipes unwanted noise into the system -- the mic plays back through your TV constantly, from what I understand. The buttons on controller 1 will probably be well worn.<br /><br />If you need to do mods, it's a bit easier to get at than the NES. No RF shields, just one compact board to deal with, though I think a top loader is similar? (I only have a front loader.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The volume slider on the 2nd controller is extremely prone to breakage.  I've had 4 different Famicoms during my life, and 3 of those 4 had flaky sliders.  I'm sure this is easily fixable (desoldering the old/soldering on a new one), but never took the time to figure it out.  Other nuances/annoyances:<br /><br />- Cartridge slot pins wear out over time (just like the front-loading NES does), since the plastic slot area is slightly too big for most cartridges, giving them room to wiggle (solution: stick pieces of paper or a thin piece of cardboard between the cartridge and the slot); my current Famicom has this problem and I would love to fix it<br />- Often difficult to find the proper AC adapter, as the unit is known to have some half-ass voltage regulators on it, so something that's even slightly high/low from what it expects can often blow the thing up.  If you need exact readings from the AC adapter (the original), let me know as I have one<br />- Wires for controllers come out of the left side, rather than the top; makes for awkward holding (I tend to stick the wire between my index and middle fingers when gripping the controller)<br />- Many people have complained that the RF is weird and requires (at least on US TVs) to pick some insane numbered channel like 210 or 47 or something like that -- I've found this (consistently every time) to be utter nonsense.  One thing to note is that the NES RF adapter can actually be used on the Famicom with success (that's how I use mine today, actually).<br />- Not really a negative, but: the Famicom does sound slightly different than the NES (and AV Famicom, which also sounds like the NES).  It sounds like there's a low-pass filter somewhere in the audio path, and possibly a more strict (?) high-pass filter, but it's the low-pass filter I tend to notice.  Some frequencies sound slightly &quot;muffled&quot; is the only way I can describe it.  It doesn't bother me in the least, it's just a difference.  :-)<br /><br />Like 3gengames, I would also recommend the AV Famicom over the standard Famicom.  However, finding an AV Famicom for a fair (or even slightly exaggerated) price is almost impossible.  eBay sellers and similar assholes jack the prices of these things up so high so they can make a fortune, then you've got the dudes who probably have 10 AV Famicoms &quot;just to hoard them&quot;... yeah, great.  Mots of the time I tend to find people who want US$200 or higher for an AV Famicom, which is just highway robbery for no justified reason.<br /><br />So in summary: original Famicom worth buying?  If you can find someone selling one for a reasonable (non-inflated) price, and you like having some classic things for nostalgia reasons, go ahead and get one.  The reason I have mine is that I have actual Famicom carts and a Famicom Disk System as well, so sometimes it's nice to hook it up to my little 13&quot; Trinitron and play.

That would indicate the Famicom itself isn't outputting anything at some specific frequency range, but rather the RF box is whats doing the signal-to-frequency conversion bit.  If you don't believe me I'm happy to make a video.  Otherwise what am I missing?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />They are both LCD TVs, maybe about 4 years old. One only supports a rather small set of tuner channels, the other supports a wide range but strangely does not allow channels from 91 to 99 (or something around that range, am not at home to test right now). In both cases I was quite surprised by this and investigated their settings thoroughly, and I am fairly certain I did not miss anything.

I had to reverse its polarity by switching the wires on it but it works perfectly fine.<br /><br />I made a video a while back that shows what the controller looks like and how short the cables are. I think they are actually 3 feet long, but that's still insanely short. An adapter that plugs into the front to let you use NES controllers is fairly easy to build (also shown in this video). <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXuxNjXNKkw" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXuxNjXNKkw</a><br /><br />The cable coming out the left side of the controller (or right side on controller II) doesn't bother me at all, actually, but I agree it's poor design compared to having it come out the top.<br /><br />As far as sound output goes, on my AV-modded famicom the sound is bright and unfiltered compared to the NES (which has a mild lowpass on the way to its built in AV-out). The balance of the noise/triangle/dmc to squares is different than my NES, though I find it varies from NES to NES anyway, not sure if there's a difference that's consistent for famicoms, or if it's just due to random resistor tolerances. If you use the RF out obviously there'll be a huge lowpass filter on it, but you should compare RF vs RF, or AV vs AV.<br /><br />The FDS fits into the regular Famicom very cleanly.<br /><br />What's the deal about duty cycles on clones?
