However, you can't use C or standard C++; instead, you have to use C# or a language called "C++/CLI with /clr:safe" that's C# with C++-style syntax. You can't take your existing C++ codebase and make a new XNA front-end for it because standard C++ and C++/CLI with /clr:safe are not compatible languages. In addition, you can't use DirectSound; instead, you have to use XACT and lose the ability to synthesize audio at runtime.

Yeah sorry if I sounded harsh, it is a valid point, but XNA still sounds like too much vendor lock-in.  Just looking it up quickly I see that everything has to be in C#, not C/C++/anything else.  So you also have to use a Microsoft-designed language, it seems they basically "own" your game in a sense.  Maybe there is a C to C# compiler though.<br /><br />65024U: I forgot to mention too, look into SDL and that tutorial I posted in the other thread.  Allegro probably is mentioned more because it's been around for longer, I remember a lot of emulators in DOS and other stuff used it.  SDL must be more recent but it is used a lot, and well-documented.  It's not as easy as NES development though, overall (IMO).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Oct 26, 2010 3:36 pm</p><hr />

Eh, after hearing about XNA not allowing any creativity with the sound at all, I knew there was no way I would ever want to use it.  I thought "indie" was short for independent, and it sounds to me like Microsoft is turning the definition on it's head, seems like anyone developing under their system would be very much dependent on Microsoft with their forced standards and rules.  I didn't know that they even get to choose what words you can and cannot use in your game, what kind of independence is that?<br /><br />Sorry for off-topic post, Dwedit your game looks pretty cool from the screens.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Oct 26, 2010 2:35 pm</p><hr />

Why not just do it on PC in the first place since it's nearly the same.....I mean, yeah, XNA has a forum with help and info on it and making PC games has nearly no info on it (Unless you have CA$H) but from searching, is there any real way to do games on PC easily with well documented programs?

Samurai dead dish washer was made with xna. It's far from a little toy's game. Yes it's not gears of war or halo in terms of technical achievement but you can make fun and GOOD games with xna, and most importantly on modern consoles. Also I think having to have a modern pc is a far better option then having to spend several thousands on actual licenses no? I AM aware of the limitations...but I do think that as an indie studio you can make a decent game with it, for cheap.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3369">Jeroen</a> — Tue Oct 26, 2010 9:29 am</p><hr />
