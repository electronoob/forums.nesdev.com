		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As you guy may or may not know, my current project needs more Vblank time than what's normally avaliable, so I decided to keep rendering disabled for a few extra scanlines in order to get a some extra cycles for PPU updates.
<br />
<br />Everything is working fine, all the code used in the NMI routine is carefully timed so that all combinations of tasks take the exact same amount of time to complete, so rendering is enabled always at the same point.
<br />
<br />However, I noticed that sprites are not displayed on the first rendered scanline. This makes sense, because the PPU needs a whole scanline for sprite evaluation, and since rendering was disabled during the previous scanline, there was no sprite evaluation. When seen on a TV, this effect is barely noticeable, but on emulators it looks a bit weird.
<br />
<br />I don't even think I should be worried about such a small glitch, but I kinda am. First, I'd like to ask you guys what would the correct way to fix this be. I'd probably have to enable sprite rendering a whole scanline before enabling background rendering... Would that result in a clean effect?
<br />
<br />Now, I'm not even sure I'll try to fix this, because I'm already using 16 scanlines (guys, I have a lot of PPU updates), which is a nice, round number. That is already quite a big chunk of the screen to give up on, so wasting another scanline just to fix that glitch does not seem worth it. I'd do it if I could squeeze my code to finish 15 scanlines in, but it has already been squeezed pretty much all it could be (it originally used 20 extra scanlines), so I doubt I could take another 113 or so cycles out of there.
<br />
<br />But just so that I don't miss an opportunity to learn, I'm asking the experts (who know much more about the inner workings of the PPU than I do) if it would be OK to enable sprite rendering one scanline before enabling background rendering to create a clean looking "border" at the top of the screen. Would it?

<br />That would involve sprite 0 and setting one background tile to always be opaque, with a visible glitch. Sprite 0 is easy in games that scroll only horizontally, but the worlds in tokumaru's game are much bigger than that.

<br />Yes I have. I think that would be the best option too, but this is far too complicated to achive in my situation, as tepples said.
<br />
<br />My type of scrolling prevents me from cleanly setting up a sprite 0 hit at the bottom of the screen. Also, I'd probably have to set up a DMC IRQ (as we talked a while ago, remember?) to make sure the hit would be detected in time.
<br />
<br />I considered using the MMC3, because it is a very common mapper, but it's scanline IRQ would not work properly because I use sprites from both sides of the pattern table.
<br />
<br />So, blanking scanlines at the top of the screen instead seemed like a good choice, I just wasn't counting on the fact that sprites have that one scanline delay (should have seen it, dumb me). Then again, this is not such a big glitch, and I doubt the player will pay attention to the top of the screen while the action is right in the middle of it.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Oh, I don't think I mind the different dot crawl pattern either... With all the action, this doesn't seem really important. And this different pattern is not really worse, IMO.

Also, if there is no sprites on the first scanline this really won't be noticeable. In fact this is always the case in normal games when rendering is always enabled, and with a PAL TV you should see this but I never really noticed this. However, the glitches that appear on the top and bottom on 99% of games using vertical mirroring when scrolling vertically are really noticeable on a PAL TV.

<br />That extra scanline need not be wasted.  You could use that line for a repetitive task (reading controller input, incrementing counters, etc.) that doesn't involve the PPU.  Keep the task within 100 cycles (or break it up if it takes longer), and you're set.
<br />
<br />Also, if you turn on sprite rendering only for the first line, the status of the PPU scroll regs is not important until you turn on the BG, so you could delay $2005/2006 writes to the following line (as long as the final write to $2006 comes after the start of H-Blank, it doesn't matter when the other writes occur - they could even occur on an earlier scanline and everything will work).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sooo..... I ended up getting rid of the sprite delay. I don't know why, but that kind of glitch messes with my head, and I couldn't live with it.
<br />
<br />By using some dirty tricks I was able to squeeze another scanline worth of time so that I could enable sprite rendering on scanline 15, and then enable background rendering on scanline 16, which results in a clean, 16 pixels tall border, masking out sprites and background evenly. Well, almost. This is what happens in Nestopia, Nintendulator and on the real console.
<br />
<br />However, I often use FCEUXD because of it's strong debugging capabilites. In fact I found out a pretty nasty bug with it. There is no way that I'll modify my code to fix a glitch that shows up in an old emulator, but I thought I'd bring it up here so that people are aware of the problem, in case they aren't already. Here's a screenshot of the glitch:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.tokumaru.kit.net/fceuxdbug.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Right after the blue border at the top, you can see part of the sprite that is in fact at the bottom of the screen. What seems to be happening is that this emulator will display, in the first scanline where sprites are enabled, the sprites that were evaluated for the scanline that came after the last visible one in the last frame. Almost like the programmer quickly modified the code to implement the sprite delay present in the console, and because of that the last scanline wrapped around to the top.
<br />
<br />And this is not just in my case, this seems to always happen to the first scanline where sprites are enabled, regardless of which one it is. You just don't usually see it, because this emulator crops the screen in NTSC mode by default, but if you set it to display all scanlines, many games end up with a glitchy first scanline.
<br />
<br />It's a shame actually. A shame that accurate emulation hasn't been coupled with good debug tools. There are a bunch of FCEU modifications that improve debugging, but if it's not such an accurate emulator, what's the point?

<br />You really are awesome on this point.
<br />
<br />Well, it's good to know which emulators have which inacuracies. Even through I use VirtuaNES a lot, I know that it's timing is off one scanline and that it allows writing to $2007 outside of VBlank, so I know what can go and what cannot go on an emulator. Does the same happens in regular FCEU ?

<br />Well, on Romhacking.net, someone released a mod of Nintendulator with better debugging features, see <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/utils/476/" class="postlink">here</a>.  I downloaded it myself and it's much better than the original Nintendulator's debugging features.  The FCEUD series still have better debugging features IMO, but it may be worth it for you.
