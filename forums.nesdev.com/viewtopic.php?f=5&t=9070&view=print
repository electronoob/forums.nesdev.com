<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Gamebridge has announced it's bringing DSiWare game creation software Petit Computer to North America this summer.<br /><br />The package serves as an introduction to the BASIC programming language that's powered games for decades. If you're not artistically inclined you can use the 512 pre-packed sprites and 256 backgrounds, or using the DSi's touch screen to draw your own.<br /><br />After you've finished coding and tweaking you can share your creations online with other users by generating QR codes using a PC or Mac. This way you'll be able to pick at others' code to see how they've created their titles, a feature we can see being very popular.<br /><br />Petit Computer is out on DSiWare and in the eShop later this year. You can find out more at the <a href="http://www.petitcomputer.com/" class="postlink">Petit Computer site.</a></div>
<br />
<br />I'm pretty excited about this, I heard about it a long time ago and thought it was the kind of thing that would never be localized.
<br />
<br />It seems surprisingly full-featured.  Here are some examples of things that have been made with it:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmhlbBLDjeo&amp;feature=related" class="postlink">Spectacle Hurricane, a Space Harrier clone</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-atBjgTQjcg&amp;feature=related" class="postlink">Super TryGunners, a space shooter</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLf4OgQuNpo&amp;feature=related" class="postlink">Genesis's Columns</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKrFsegkwUI&amp;feature=related" class="postlink">Fantasy Zone (made in the older version of the program, the current one is mk. II)</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfYRCZGYqYU&amp;feature=related" class="postlink">The intro from Ys 3 (really smooth scrolling)</a>
<br />
<br />It looks like you can do almost anything on the level of most 8 or 16 bit games, probably limited by size somewhat.
<br />
<br />If you want to get to know more about it ahead of time and don't know Japanese, you can run the manual through Google Translate like I'm doing. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br /><a href="http://tinyurl.com/7dy7kxe" class="postlink">Starting here,</a> and you have to change the "p01" to "p02" etc. manually because the buttons lose their functionality in Translate.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://tinyurl.com/7pdv756" class="postlink">Here are the included sprites,</a> and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ca7rn69" class="postlink">here are included BG tiles (further down).</a>  Looks like music is a standard MIDI set, programmable through MML, and there are a number of included songs and sound effects too.
<br />
<br />It comes with 23 built in example programs, some simple and some complex, ranging from a calculator and guess-the-number all the way to a first person RPG and a fighting game.  You can re-save all of them and edit them any way you like, which should be very helpful for learning the system.
<br />
<br />No date given, and no official word on a localization outside of North America.

<br />A open-source clone could be written and if it can use the same format then we can work it on PC and other computers and transfer to 3DS file using SD cards or QR codes, if it is able to do so.
<br />
<br />But first you have to figure out what it is, in order to do so.

<br />
<br />First, a Japanese guy has made a PC editor suite for this called <a href="http://micutil.com/ptcutilities/top_e.html" class="postlink">PTCUtilities.</a>  There is a rough English version.  However, it has some issues.  I don't know enough about it to be sure, but I think it's coded for 2 byte Japanese characters and sometimes screws up on English platforms because of it.  When you paste code into it there is a 75% chance of the program simply crashing.  More code increases the chance, smaller/simpler code decreases it.  It could also be due to the context coloring screwing up because of all the instantly pasted text...not sure.  In any case, always save before doing anything involving the clipboard.
<br />
<br />But it's still a great program!  You save your program to the SD card, open the ptc file in PTCUtilities, make edits, convert back to QR and scan it back in.
<br />
<br />Smileboom has been posting free graphic sets you can use for your own games. The ones they've given out recently are for people who want to make their own Advance Wars! QR codes at the links, including palettes:

<br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/xMF8m.png" class="postlink">I made a demo for smoothly scrolling around the Dragon Quest 1 world map.</a>  Diagonals are a little jittery because Petit Computer is not fast enough to draw both a horizontal and vertical row of tiles in the same frame (or maybe I just coded it poorly?). It wouldn't be a problem if I split up the horizontal/vertical drawing between two frames but this is just a demo. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  It also plays the town theme.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/vjzfq.png" class="postlink">I also made a simple text adventure engine</a> (choose-your-own-adventure style, no parser or anything).  It was meant to help beginners but I thought I'd share it anyway.  People online were doing a bunch of IF statements for every page so I thought I'd show them how to do it through DATA statements.

<br />
<br />What I would prefer is some simple specification of data format I could try to make something myself to read/write these file and which is open-source. And then later on we can also write a clone of the BASIC interpreter used to run the same program on other computers too.

<br />
<br />You're not going to see an open source clone that works on regular PCs.  You'd basically have to write a DS emulator to get it to work to the exact same spec, since some included commands seem to clearly use DS's built-in sprite scaling/rotation/collision capabilities, with whatever unique quirks they might have.  You also need to extract the program's included audio samples for its ~127 instruments and at least as many sound effects.  If you really want to be thorough, you also have to reverse engineer or license the speech synthesis tech used in the Japanese version.
