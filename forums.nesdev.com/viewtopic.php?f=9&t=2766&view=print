It looks like it probably is bad, so I uploaded the "good" version and it flashed fine. But I am still unable to get it working. The battery seems to still be working, not sure if that would keep it from booting or not though.

<br />
<br />Yeah, if your RAM contents are hosed (and it almost always is in a GAR you find in the wild) you have to upload a new set from gar.bin.  Then it SHOULD work.  If it doesn't, then something else could be wrong.  Make sure there's no other problems with it, like a broken germanium diode, or bad solder or something.  Also, try uploading a few times and try an "easy" game first, like SMB.  Never use multicarts in the GAR!  That is how I hosed mine.
<br />
<br />It apparently can't figure out the address matters vs. the data, and it makes the game crash... the run away code is what then hoses it sometimes if you're unlucky.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, well the battery must be good then because the RAM will retain whatever data you upload to it just fine. I looked over the soldering somewhat, you can tell it was done by hand. The only potential problem I see is that pins 13 &amp; 14 on the 74S00N are bridged with solder. It's possible there is a trace hiding underneath it though. Could someone with a GAR take a look and see if these 2 pins are supposed to be connected?
<br />
<br />Also, I have only tried playing it on my CopyNES, as I don't have a plain NES at the moment. I wouldn't think that would be a problem though.

<br />
<br />Someone once told me that they thought the code looked extremely similar to the Game Master Boy's code, pretty much confirming that Bung had everthing to do with the GAR and made them under a shell company.  I believe it was Kyuusaku, iirc.  Then, again, my memory blows.
