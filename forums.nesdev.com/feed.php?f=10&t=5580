But if it's at the bottom, 2 writes to $2006 should do it (because fine Y scrolling can be 0).<br /><br />Another example is when you extend VBlank time at the top of the screen. Since you went past the time rendering usually starts, you have to set the scroll the mid-frame way.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Sep 24, 2009 9:20 am</p><hr />

This is fairly common, and although annoying, is justified.  AHCI support isn't something XP includes, so you get to disable it in your system BIOS to install the OS then install AHCI support + set the BIOS back to AHCI.  You solved the problem in a more efficient manner by making your own XP CD with slipstreamed drivers using nLite.<br /><br />Otherwise, if you have a USB or non-USB floppy drive on your system, download Intel's AHCI drivers and put them on a floppy disk as instructed, then hit F6 during the XP installation (during the initial blue screen; bottom status bar should read "Press F6 to install a third-party driver").<br /><br />The drivers you want in both cases (slipstreaming or via F6 install) are here:<br /><br /><a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&amp;ProdId=2101&amp;DwnldID=17883&amp;lang=eng" class="postlink">http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&amp;ProdId=2101&amp;DwnldID=17883&amp;lang=eng</a><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">miau wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />My XP disc was pretty old, though, no idea if the problem still exists with newer ones.<br /></div><br /><br />Microsoft does not include AHCI drivers with their operating systems (XP nor Vista), thus the latest XP SP3 OEM CDs do not include AHCI support.<br /><br />I'm unable to confirm/deny Windows 7 having native AHCI support, since the version we use at work is IT-managed which means it includes numerous drivers of all sorts for different desktops/laptops/etc...

Hmmm just tell ya that I have Windows Vista on my new Laptop (yep, can't get rid of that, Vista is pre-installed), moreover, Vista 64-bit, but I've not encountered compatibility issues yet, and I'm finding myself lucky. It's true that I'm not a gamer, I only have a few programs in my machine, but it is doing well. Hell, my old console programs run correctly. ASM6 runs correctly, too. So Vista isn't that bad... Vista is just annoying at times and it lacks some useful menus found in XP.<br /><br />For ASM6, I made a script in Notepad++ so I just hit Ctrl+Alt+F12, it compiles and run it if successful, else it shows me the ASM6 errors (in Notepad)<br /><br />(Yep, I didn't make any advertising, but now I understand the NES PPU and I'm able to make NES ROMs, I only annoyed for a few seconds kevtris in order to understand the infamous "loopy doc's", that's all (BTW, thanks again kev))<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=336">Jarhmander</a> — Mon Sep 21, 2009 6:16 am</p><hr />

Vista does suck, but as far as I know, it can assemble NES ROMs.<br /><br />It's just that assemblers are usually something called "command line programs". This means that they don't have a user interface (with windows, menus, buttons, etc). These have to be called with parameters, then they do their thing, possibly give messages of success or failure, and finally exit.<br /><br />Nowadays everyone is used to double-clicking. If you double-click a command line program it won't receive any parameters, so it will have nothing to do and will just exit. In the case of assemblers, the most obvious parameter they need is the name of the file that contains the program to assemble.<br /><br />To make your life easier, it's best to place the assembler in some folder that's easy to type, such as "C:\ASM6". Then you have 2 options: open a command prompt and go to the folder where your asm file is and type "c:\ASM6\ASM6 mygame.asm" or something like that. The other (much better) option is to create a file in the same folder as the .ASM file, name it something like "assemble.bat" and type the following in it:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">C:\ASM6\ASM6 mygame.asm<br />pause</div><br />This .BAT file can be double-clicked, and it will tell the assembler to assemble your file. The "pause" command is there to prevent the window from closing right away (it will only do so after you press a key), so that you can see whatever text the assembler outputs (messages of success or failure).<br /><br />EDIT: If you do need to make a virtual machine, VirtualBox is free and is pretty good.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Sep 21, 2009 4:26 am</p><hr />

I dig Lj65 and look forward to the platformer as well!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3855">eleventhirtyfour</a> — Sun Sep 20, 2009 8:32 pm</p><hr />
