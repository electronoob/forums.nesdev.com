They both came from buyitic. <br /><br />I am using the gq-4x usb programmer with the tsop to Willem adaptor. <br /><br />Now I can I'd my chip. <br />Read verify etc etc but when I write it just seems just freeze and i have to un plug in restart all over again. <br /><br />Both chips do this. I I am using win 7 64 and i removed my Rom header with snestool <br />Has anyone had this problem <br /><br /><br />Thanks all

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey all,<br /><br />I have found out after leaving it for 1 hour then shutting the program down unplugging and then starting it up again if i read the chip it appears that it write the file fine then loops it untill it has filled the entire flash chip.<br /><br />Has anyone experienced this?  would i be able to just remove the header from the SMC file and not split it write it to the TSOP then mount it as normal? or will it have issue having the rom repeated once it finishes?
