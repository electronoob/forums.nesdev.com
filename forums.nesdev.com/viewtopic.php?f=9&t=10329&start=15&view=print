I'd imagine there are some timing constraints due to the mechanics of the one way spinning disc.  You wouldn't be able to easily use the bios' routines since you're not on a 6502.  A quick look at the wiki suggests that one could asynchronously read and write from the disc via $4024/5 and $4030/1 one byte at a time.  I'll have to dig into this some more because that sounds too easy...   Whatever timing contstraints there are I'm sure you could work with them, just makes the process a little tricky, might have to write the time critical code in asm vice C.<br /><br />The list of reasons I should invest in a FDS are starting to grow now...

Over years, should they get corrupted or their data damaged somehow, I would like to know that I have the option of re-writing them with a fresh copy of the image. <br /><br />I can't imagine data is pushed very fast for the system simply given its age; surely a microcontroller would have the gusto to do what FDSLoadr has done in the past to write to a disk drive?</div><br /><br />The disks themselves are pretty durable after nearly 30 years. With my MGD1 setup (I haven't tried my FDS to parallel cable yet), I can easily overwrite disk that were previously unuseable. Not everyone has a PC with parallel port and a setup like mine (not to mention that yoyr FDS drive needs to be modded for write capability), so I do agreee that a more modern setup for writing FDS disks is necessary. I actually prefer playing FDS games from FDS disks rather than a flash cart.</div><br /><br />I guess I poorly wrote that - What I mean is that should a disk become corrupted (say some idiot uses a magnet to secure a disk to a fridge) then I have no means of restoring the data, which your setup does allow. <br /><br />Modifying the FDS is fairly trivial and is a one-time operation, so I don't see it as a huge obstacle. <br /><br />How about something like a homebrew RAM adapter, that has a modern interface on it, and sort of does a modernized version of what the MGD1 does?

Just an mcu to interface between USB and the disk drive's serial cable.  Cut the ram adapter out completely.
