The Robotron style games for Super NES (Super Smash TV, Total Carnage, Williams Arcade Classics) used the A, B, X, and Y buttons for shooting in various directions (A: east; B+Y: southwest), but the NES controller doesn't have that luxury.

I'm probably going to work out the status bar next, however. Oh, and the palette refreshing code in the NMI has been fixed. Someone informed me that if you are setting bit 2 of $2000, then it not only increments by 32 in the nametables, but in everything you do to $2007. The more you know hehe So that is all worked out now! I'll try and keep this post non-tl;dr, but no promises ; )

For a NES controller? :(</div><br />No disrespect taken ; )<br /><br />Well, the main reason I did that was for the sake of comfort. Take Gotcha! The Sport, for instance. You use the controller to move left and right, while holding the zapper in the other hand. Now, it doesn't feel too bad with that game, but if the up and down buttons were included, then things would tend to not feel comfortable over time. With the controller sideways, it fits nicely in your palm, and you don't have to worry about cramping up as easily since your other hand isn't there to balance out the controller. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Dwedit wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Go ahead, reinvent Phantasy Star on a system not designed to run such a game.</div><br /><br />I still haven't had a chance to play that game, so I YouTubed it up to see what they do in their mazes. Pretty impressive haha No way would I even _think_ to try to make it something like that, though. I do like the way they look, however!<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">marvelus10 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">This is something I'm very excited to see done.

<br />My friends and I used to joke about making a COPS game, which would require a powerpad, controller, zapper, perhaps the powerglove too.
<br />
<br />About Phantasy Star, the SMS does flipping of the BG tiles instead of sprites, that must have been helpful.

<br />I'm thinking Roth intends to use this concept to make more than just a demo. A game that requires the controller and zapper isn't insane or crazy; it's actually an idea that a lot of people have had, I'm pretty sure (I once thought of it myself). Seeing it finally applied would be cool.

<br />I'd bet an order of magnitude more people have an FLV or SWF player installed than a Theora player installed. If it bothers you, use keepvid.com to download the FLV or MP4 and then an libavcodec based player.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The demo looks pretty nice. There are a lot of possibilities for an engine like this. I'm somewhat a fan of the old Bard's Tale series (it's like Dungeon Magic: Sword of the Elements), and this type of engine would be appropriate for that too. Shadow of Yserbius (for PC/DOS) was also this style of 3D, but it also had a nice map display and a slick party system (it was multiplayer). 1 or 2 player like this could be extremely fun, with side-by-side views or a cooperative play to help manage a large party (maybe each player could manage 4 characters in combat?)
<br />
<br />Your idea of mixing zapper and maze crawling is interesting too, I would wonder if it could be just as fun to let it automatically guide you through the maze or to select the direction you wish to go with the zapper instead (like have some arrows in the corners/edges of the screen?)
