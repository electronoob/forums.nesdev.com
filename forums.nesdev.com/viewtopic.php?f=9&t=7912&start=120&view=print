<br />
<br />Then run anago from the command prompt with the proper dumping script depending on what mapper the game has.
<br />
<br />naviagate to the folder where anago is and you command should look something like this:
<br />
<br />anago d unrom.ad contra.nes
<br />
<br />anago is the program
<br />d for dump
<br />unrom.ad is the dumping script
<br />contra.nes is the name you want to give the rom you're dumping

I have found a couple of games I couldn't get to dump, only 2 so far, some I had to remove the PC board from the cart to get a good dump due to the weird way the board was. The only 2 I have had no luck with so far are A Boy &amp; His Blob and Bases Loaded 2 with the included dumping scripts, I've dumped about 142 games so far out of the 702 I have.....

<br />I don't know how to install the firmware(the bootload not worked?)！
<br />If it is done！I think i can dump successful,because i know the mapper's elements.

<br />
<br />The bootloader was only on the microcontrollers I provided kits for.  The bootloader still needs to be flashed onto the microcontroller with a AVR programmer.  Don't forget you'll also need to program the fuse bytes as well.
<br />
<br />You basically just got a blank microcontroller from wherever you bought it.  You'll need a AVR programmer something like this: <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9046" class="postlink">http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9046</a>
<br />
<br />EDIT: looks like that is just a 10pin to 6pin converter.  Here's the actual programmer <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9825" class="postlink">http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9825</a> My PCB was set up for a 6pin programmer but I'm guessing you didn't make boards that look identical to mine.  You could go with either a 10pin or 6pin it doesn't really matter, just wire up your PCB to go with whatever your programmer has.
<br />
<br />If you don't plan on playing around with the firmware much I would recommend just loading the firmware released with the download that came with the software.  Speaking of I need to share the bootloader and clipped kazzo firmware for anyone else who may need it.
<br />
<br />It sounds like this is your first microcontroller project, if you'd rather do something like mail me your microcontroller I can flash it for you free of charge.  I would have you cover the return shipping though.  Send me a PM or email if you're interested.  The programmer isn't that expensive but if you don't really have a use for one aside from this one time this option might be simpler and easier.

<br />Yeah just make sure you pay attention to my EDIT I made in that last post if you plan on buying a programmer from the link I sent.  Initially I only linked to an adapter.

<br />Can you give any more details besides "it doesn't work"?
<br />
<br />Things like:
<br />-What operating system your using
<br />-If the kazzo is even being recognized by the computer.
<br />-What kind of  errors your getting with the kazzo.
<br />-Is everything dumping but your just getting bad dumps?
<br />-details details details...
<br />
<br />Can you provide a good close up picture of the circuit board to see if you have any apparent issues with the board?
