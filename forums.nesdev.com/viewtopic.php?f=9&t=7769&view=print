		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I purchased a front-loading NES unit off eBay (seller claimed it had a brand new 72-pin connector in it), which included some games as well.  I did this because my top-loader is wonderfully plagued by shitty RF output and the "banding" problem.  Oce I received the NES I found the shipper had decided to ship it with a cartridge in the slot to save room inside the shipping box.  Idiot.
<br />
<br />Only a few of my NES carts, including ones that came with the system, actually work when inserted into the slot.  Otherwise I get either CIC problems (blinking power LED) or garbled CHR on-screen (more common).  All of them work as long as I press down hard enough on the cart while the system is on.  (And boy composite out on the front-loader sure looks beautiful compared to the top-loader!)
<br />
<br />Naturally my first conclusion was "the idiot stressed the pins shipping the thing with a cart in it", followed by "this isn't a new 72-pin connector at all, I bet I end up having to buy a new one".
<br />
<br />So I cleaned all the edge connectors with Q-tips and rubbing alcohol.  No difference.
<br />
<br />Then I tried using a small/thin screwdriver and a bobby pin to lift the pins on the 72-pin connector "upwards" a bit.  Again: no difference.
<br />
<br />Finally I bought a replacement/new 72-pin connector and installed it tonight.  The cartridges felt a lot more tight/stiff when being inserted.  But, no difference.
<br />
<br />The NES itself is not faulty -- what appears to be the problem is the spring-loading mechanism not pushing the carts down far enough (e.g. some of the pin contacts aren't making good/firm contact with the cartridges).
<br />
<br />I remember dealing with this exact problem back when I was a kid.  All I can find online are nutballs talking about replacing the 72-pin connector, and some places talking about how the quality of the connector matters (but nobody providing validation of that, nor any alternate vendors).
<br />
<br />I remember Memblers (?) talking about cartridge PCB thickness making a huge difference, so I imagine some of the carts I have use thinner PCBs than what the edge connectors are permitting, thus shoddy contacts.  Not much I can do about that.
<br />
<br />I'm looking for recommendations on how to fix this problem permanently (besides doing stupid crap like shoving cardboard in the connector slot alongside a cartridge), or if the 72-pin connector is in fact the issue, recommendations on reputable places to buy a replacement (money isn't too big of an issue, but I'm not going to pay $100 for a connector, obviously :P).
<br />
<br />Thanks.

<br />The guy took the cartridge connector from a game genie and basicly built a top-loading NES out of a Toaster.
<br />The other drastic method would be to install an AV-Mod to your top-loader.
<br />
<br />I'm not an expert with this, but it seems that both methods require you to do a lot of soldering...

<br />If the CIC pins are making a bad connection, the PRG and CHR pins probably are too.

<br />
<br />I've heard the better thing to do is to refurbish a Nintendo made connector. You can either try cleaning them or I've heard you can remove the pins from them and put in new ones.

It would never work as much as a tried on the one she gave me, but it worked right away on my top-loader NES. On my old regular NES that I had as a kid there were some games that took forever to get working (Zelda 2 was particularly bad).
<br />
<br />Basically, if you mess with them enough and clean the contacts you will eventually get the game working, but it will never work nearly as well as your top-loader. But definitely cut off the CIC as it's annoyingly picky.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My childhood trick for the NES was, after you push the cart down, use your two index fingers and kinda wiggle the cart out a little bit, and point the back end of the cart to the left. That usually solved most connection problems.
<br />
<br />My other trick was to just use a game genie without any codes. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />As far as garbled graphics, my current front-loading NES has a problem where, if I don't use it for a long time, the graphics just <em>will not</em> work correctly (which also breaks SMB's title screen), and no amount of cleaning/fiddling will fix it. However, after playing some games like normal (despite the glitched graphics), the graphics will fix themselves, and the NES will work fine for months and months. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />Maybe your NES does this too?

<br />
<br />I do. It's called a Yobo <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> Seriously though, I have not once had an issue with the connector on the Yobo. Every game I buy gets a thorough cleaning with alcohol before it is ever put in, and I have literally never had an issue.
<br />
<br />It's the number one reason that I do not own a toaster model. I have had three of those over the course of my life and all they bring is pain and disappointment <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />The only down side is the Yobo's somewhat poor video quality, bugged sound and incompatibility with Game Gennie and MMC5.\
<br />
<br />Still though, for $20 brand new from a brick-and-mortar store you really can't beat it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Welcome to the world of the front-loading NES. It really is like this all the time, no fix for it.
<br />Gambled garphics and random freezes are common, no matter how clean your carts are etc... Contrary to popular belief, it's just bad connexion, not dirt or anything.
<br />
<br />The only thing that half fixed it was to open your NES, use some safety pin to lift all the connector pins and close back your NES. The pins will make better contact, but you will still have problems occasionally.
<br />
<br />The only way I had to be able to enjoy a 100% working system is to import a toploader all the way from USA, and AV mod it. Now it works wonders, and the connector ALWAYS work (I'd guess the FC and AV Famicom connector's also works fine like that).
<br />
<br /> 
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> The guy took the cartridge connector from a game genie and basicly built a top-loading NES out of a Toaster.</div>
<br />I wonder if it was a mistake or if it was really the front loader which is called "toaster". All toaster I've ever seen in my life are top loading, but maybe front loading ones are common in america ??
