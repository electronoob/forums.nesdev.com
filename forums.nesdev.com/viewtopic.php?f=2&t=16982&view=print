		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi Guys, I'm new to assembly as well as to NES dev so you'll have to excuse my ignorance on some things.  I've been going through the nerdy nights tutorials on nintendo age and I was wondering about flipping a sprite horizontally.  I'm using a fairly long method of reading the controller input for now, which I will soon fix, but in the mean time I'm going to run with it.  <br /><br />I have 4 sprites that make up big mario and I'm moving them all together in a loop.  I'm using an or on the attribute bit to flip each sprite.  The problem is that in addition to flipping the sprite, it flips their position as well.  <br /><br />Anyways, this is the code that I have:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ReadLeft:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;LDA $4016<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;AND #%00000001<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;BEQ ReadLeftDone<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;LDX #$00<br />MoveLeftLoop:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;LDA $0203, x ; get sprite 1 x pos<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;SEC&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;; set carry<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;SBC #$01&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; x -= 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;STA $0203, x ; move all 4 sprites<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;; flip sprite horizontally<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;LDA $0202, x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; get attribute byte<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ORA #%01000000&nbsp; &nbsp;; flip horizontally<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;STA $0202, x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; store the flip<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;INX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;INX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;INX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;INX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;CPX #$10<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;BNE MoveLeftLoop<br /></div><br /><br />Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong?

So if you have two sprites at 0,0 and 8,0, flip their H mirror and want the whole metasprite to flip, they must be relocated to 8,0 and 0,0.<br /><br />Edit: dougeff ninja'd and got into better detail.

So instead of 1 meta sprite, you have two?  Do you just set that meta sprite so that each individual sprite has the correct relationship after the toggled flip?  Do you then have to move sprite 1 off the screen and position sprite 2 correctly?  Or is there some way to flip between sprite 1 and 2?<br /><br />for #2, that makes sense.  I would have to refactor so I'm not setting the position inside a loop, or checking if I'm on an odd or even sprite or something like that.

In most games sprite memory is discarded and rebuilt each frame; there's no persistence. I think you're getting confused by not doing it this way.

Maybe a typical one has 4 tiles? 16 bytes per sprite for an extra flipped version adds up pretty fast.<br /><br />On the other hand, a metasprite drawing routine is probably only ~60 bytes total. So, what I did is copy-paste my sprite routine and make a separate flipped version that's different in the following ways:<br /><br /><ul><li>input X = X + 8 (+4 cycles per metasprite)</li><li>subtract metasprite tile X from input X instead of add (same number of cycles)</li><li>XOR the attribute byte for flip (+2 cycles per tile)</li></ul><br />So, the &quot;slower&quot; aspect is really quite minor (~12 cycles per sprite), and the code/data trade begins paying off at only 4 sprites or so.<br /><br />There's other ways of doing it, and if your game is not horizontally oriented you might want vertical flips as well, etc. but generally I find it pretty worthwhile to have two routines. If you want to spent a few more cycles per tile, you could even share most of the code between the two routines, saving even more space. You could even piggyback a palette swap option into the attribute XOR... there's lots of ways to customize this to suit your needs.
