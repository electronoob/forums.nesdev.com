I'm not familiar with how to deal with out-of-country taxes and regulations, so for now I'd like to keep that simple. However, If I have to, I'll do the research and figure out what to do. You can release the source and ROM online additionally if you want. You set the price, but I would recommend keeping it under 10 dollars for acceptable and 5 dollars for optimal. Sivak's pricing for Battle Kid is going to be about 4.49 or 4.99. We'll test it out and see what the market will bear. <br /><br />How are royalties dealt with?<br />I send you a check and a 1099 that you have to file with your taxes at the beginning of the calendar year. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">slobu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">As a side this website is effectively endorsing piracy with EMUYa by telling people to go to CoolRoms:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.oriku.com/emuya.html">http://www.oriku.com/emuya.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />If they really want to endorse your product they should recommend PDROMs.de for public domain homebrew.</div><br /><br />Oriku is my brother's company that we'll be releasing EMUya under. <br /><br />Thats a good point. I should update that w/ PDROMs.de. <br /><br />I'm kind of torn about how to handle people wanting to play &quot;classic&quot; games. In order for people to open up EMUya in the first place to see your indie games, there needs to be a reason to do so and also a reason for people to come back regularly to see the new games that you put on the store. A store with 1 or 2 games in there is not enough to keep people's attention. And while eventually the store will be populated with many indie NES games, eventually may never happen as the store needs a launching point to get off the ground. So, I think at first, we need to have support in there for that, but eventually we can take it out if need be.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Seems like kind of a hassle to have to sell a rom though the emulator only especially with the taxing issues and such.  Shouldn't the developer be able to somehow sell the rom on their own accord through OUYA and then it could be loaded in your emulator or others that were compatible?  Why not do something like that as a possible option?  Sure it may be easier for the rom to get undesirably distributed though piracy, but if the developer cared more about that than taxes through you it'd be worth it.  You could even provide an encryption key with the rom that only allowed it to be unlocked in EMUya or whatever it gets named.  Then one wouldn't have to worry about royalties but still have about the same amount of copy protection right?  Especially if you're not charging anything to play a rom in your EMUya.  In the case that you didn't charge you're basically dealing with the exchange of money and tax accounting of all game sales for NO income on your end.  Doesn't exactly sound like a fun time to me, but perhaps your a programmer and hobby accountant... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><br />With a 1099 you can't write off any of your expenses of development.  All earnings are taxable income.  Although I guess if OUYA is giving you a 1099 also then the only thing different is who it's coming from.

We will be bringing time attacks to the masses and hosting tool assisted time attack competitions =D<br /><br />EMUya also emulates the NTSC signal, giving you a very authentic feel.<br /><br />All games run locked at 60fps with attention paid to input lag.<br /><br /><br /><strong>[these pics were far bigger than my PC's monitor --MOD]</strong><br />Edit: yeah they are quite big. Elgato capture device I suppose. I'll resize and re-upload.
