That's about 30 cycles for 1 cycle, or about 15 the way I'm thinking because there can't be PPU memory access in rendering time. Is that enough? I don't know much assembly, either CHIP-8 (none at all) or NES (a tiny bit).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1000 would be too much for the NES to handle, because even though many of the operations are simple, you still have to fetch the instruction, decode it, update the VM state, and so on, for every instruction. Also, drawing sprites is a fairly slow process, since it involves bit shifting, bitwise operations, and even more operations to check if any pixels were erased, all of this between several bytes, but the whole thing still consumes 1 cycle, apparently.<br /><br />Most examples on that page work fine at 100 cycles per frame though, or even less, and that's fairly realistic for a possible NES version. That should be made configurable on the NES as well, IMO.

If we can put the most-used variables in non-PPU RAM it could give a speed boost.<br />Edit: As NovaSquirrel said, it would be possible to analyse the ROM to see what is never changed, but my RAM layout could act as a fallback?

Could there be a NES thermometer?

That makes WRAM (battery backed?) all the more important. <br /><br />you could either transfer the programs to RAM via an usb to nes port cable and an app on your pc, or it could work like family basic, complete with a suitable interface. Most likely something T9-inspired since keyboards aren't an option. 35 opcodes would be no match for a d-pad hexnumpad + action button. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text</a><!-- m -->)
