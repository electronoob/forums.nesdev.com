<br />Nesicide can load CA65/LD65-generated debug info files and do source-level and symbolic debugging.  If your project doesn't involve any external homebrew tools during its compilation phase, then Nesicide could even build your .nes and debug info file for you and then let you source-level and symbolically debug.
<br />
<br />I know Nesicide *can* run on a Mac.  But I don't own a Mac with which to do an update to the woefully outdated Mac build available on the website.
<br />
<br />Thefox also added source-level and symbol debug capabilities to Nintendulator...again based around CA65/LD65-generated debug info files.

<br />
<br />The build and debug capabilities of Nesicide2 are far better than those of Nesicide1.  Nesicide1 still used the in-built ASM6-like assembler written by myself.  
<br />
<br />Nesicide1's debugger was contained all in the same dialog and was cluttered!  Nesicide2 splits the "debugger" into several (25+) dockable widgets that represent some aspect of the NES system: Breakpoints, Symbol watching, CPU execution trace (log and graphical view), CPU code/data graphical view, CPU disassembly view, CPU registers, CPU memory, PPU registers, PPU internal state, PPU OAM (binary and graphical view), PPU NameTable (binary and graphical view), PPU palette, APU registers, APU internal state, Cartridge mapper registers, Cartridge internal mapper state, Cartridge CHR viewer (binary and graphical view), Cartridge EXRAM memory, Cartridge SRAM memory.
<br />
<br />Nesicide2 supports source-level debugging and symbol inspection; Nesicide1 did not.
<br />
<br />Nesicide2 uses a Scintilla text editor component ported to Qt which is much more feature rich (margins, syntax highlighting, etc.) than the default text edit controls in MFC or Qt.  Nesicide2 will soon support call-tips.
<br />
<br />The emulator in Nesicide2 is far more accurate than the emulator in Nesicide1.  However, the abundance of debug hooks has resulted in performance issues on some users machines.  I don't know what Mac performance is like...
<br />
<br />The project file format of Nesicide2 is XML-based and thus mostly human readable.  The project file format of Nesicide1 is binary.
<br />
<br />Nesicide2 does not (yet) have any of Nesicide1's "designers" ported over, stuff like the Palette Editor, Tile Editor, NameTable Editor, Music Tracker (this was only half working anyway).  I've started down this porting path but have not made much progress.  We'd been talking about a plugin interface to support whatever output formats people dream up.
<br />
<br />At one point the plan was to port FamiTracker to Qt and bundle it with Nesicide2.  That's still the plan but hasn't been worked.
<br />
<br />I haven't maintained Nesicide1 since the switch from MFC to Qt (for Nesicide2).  
<br />
<br />In other words, Nesicide2 is superior even though it's currently lacking some of the Nesicide1 pieces.

It is written in standard Python 2.5, so it should work just fine on the Mac.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I created a namelist file generator for use with FCEUXDSP 1.07, and CA65 code. It captures symbol names of all .proc, comments, and labels. Plus it can process all of those things for multiple banks. I've found it truly invaluable while developing my game. I think at least one other guy, metalslime, uses it. If it sounds like something you can use send me a pm and I'll send you the latest version of it.

<br />cpow, any chance you have a link to the CA65 debug file format? I'd love my projects to support this format as well.

<br />
<br />The format is changing dramatically since Uz is currently updating it.  I would recommend just compiling a project with CC65 and taking a look at the resulting debuginfo file...it's text.  Uz provides a debuginfo file parser you can compile into your program, which is what NESICIDE and Nintendulator (with TheFox's debug stuff) do.
