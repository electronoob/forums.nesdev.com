I'm just speculating what kind of animation system my next game would have, since I am on a never ending quest to find the perfect animation system.  What I just thought about is having 8 pixels of forced blank on top and bottom of the screen will give me 54 lines of dma time, and up to 9207 bytes per frame.  Just enough time to update 50% of sprite patterns, and OAM, and BG scrolling.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sounds like a good compromise, 8 pixels on top and bottom doesn't sound like it'd eat a lot of space if it can help getting better animations.<br /><br />However I wonder if this could cause problem to start the HDMA if you use any. Pehaps you'd have to start them manually if you use forced blanking at the top of the screen. I might be wrong though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Before I start programming anything, I need to figure out what should I do if the game needs more than 64 16x16 sprites.  Should I run all animation at 30fps?  I can't remember if the explosions in Busty Baby were 30fps or 60fps.  The explosions in Secret Agent Insane Maniac were animated at 60fps, but I had to stop development for that game because I maxed out vram and dma bandwidth.<br /><br />EDIT:  I just checked BBBB's code, and the explosions are at 30fps.  I guess I'll animate all sprites at 30fps, since I can't tell the difference between BBBB and SAIM explosion's animation speed.

That way pushing the zoom button to make the game fill the screen wouldn't cut much off. Umihara Kawase was way ahead of its time in putting the HUD in the 16:9 safe area.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, I thought a little about how to impliment it.  In order to get 8kB of animated sprite patterns into that time, I need as little CPU work as possible during v-blank.  Having every sprite being DMAed individually takes too much CPU time during v-blank, so I'm going to use a sprite VRAM buffer.  Because the SNES stores sprite patterns in 2D tile formation, I am going to use 2 vram buffers, and use 2 DMA channels, and alternate between the two every group of 16 8x8 tiles.

It's like a 128x128 pixel sprite sheet or like 2D mode on the GBA. Unless you copy eight 16x16 cells in one block, you have to copy the top and bottom halves separately.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Psycopathicteen's engines typically use what some of us have called the &quot;Battletoads&quot; method: they <a href="http://pineight.com/gba/managing-sprite-vram.txt" class="postlink">load in a sprite cel just as it's about to be used</a>, rather than keeping all of a character's sprite cels in VRAM at once. Unless your sprites are fighting game sized, each frame of animation typically won't span eight different 16x16 pixel sprite cels.<br /><br />Could you describe or draw a diagram of how you recommend to organize the data?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, to me it sounded like he wanted to update half of the sprites every other frame. I might have misunderstood his original requirements though.<br />I interpreted it as the following:<br />- I have a 16x16 area in sprite VRAM for each object on screen<br />- I want to animate each sprite at a rate of 30Hz<br />- During every VBlank I want to 1) Update OAM 2) Update BG map (probably a single row/col) 3) Upload 8KB of sprite data.<br />The easiest solution I can think of is the following:<br />divide the sprite table into two parts of same size and update each one at a rate of 30Hz (alternating every other frame). This could be done by a block copy easily, couldn't it? It always updates half of the sprite table regardless of actual changes taking place, though.

I'll try to see if the existing code can be optimized a little more, and then I'll program it to adapt to the number of sprites onscreen, instead of copying 64 sprites per frame.  I might as well use shorter DMA legnths when less sprites are onscreen too, just to get as much CPU time in as possible.
