		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I actually considered both things a while ago and come to conclusion these aren't the way to go.<br /><br />The Basic to C converters won't work effectively, because they are designed for well developed, modern C compilers for 32-bit platforms, and you have to use many tricks on the NES to get good perfomance from a C program. There are also various compatibility reasons, and probably difficulties with distribution - you won't want to tell a newcomer how to 'download this there, that there, now configure that and that etc'. It should work out of the box, in a few clicks in an installer, otherwise it makes no sense.<br /><br />Retargeting an existing compiler is also a problem. First, there are no Basic compilers that were designed to be retargettable. They are designed for a certain platform, mostly modern ones. There are barely any open source compilers at all. Boriel's ZX Basic compiler is probably the only open source 8-bit Basic compiler, but besides not being designed to be retargettable, it is also written in Python, that raises distribution and compatibility problems. It is relatively easy to make a SMS version of the compiler, because both platforms share the same CPU, but changing it to 6502 will be a major pain.<br /><br />So I'm personally pretty sure the only solution here is to make a new 6502 targeted Basic compiler from scratch.
