<br />
<br />I'd say the developers of Pitfall were heroes. Most games on the 2600 I find to be complete crap with like no gameplay. Perhaps if there were MMCs like with the NES there could have been better games. Then again, I probably don't have nearly enough exposure to 2600 games to fully appreciate it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well it does look like it took a large amount of skill and patience to program for this system! It also looks like only game logic can happen when the screen isn't being drawn, because the whole time you have to reset the BG info for the current scanline. At least each scanline is <em>exactly</em> 76 scanlines, so they are much easier to work with for timed code than the NES is.
<br />
<br />I can also see that the 2600 would be the perfect console to develop for if you want to submit something to the MiniGames Competition. They have 1, 2, and 4k categories (I think they may have added an 8k). So any game you make for the 2600 will at the very least qualify for the 4k category.
<br />
<br />And 128 bytes of RAM... Wow. you can keep track of like... 8 different people's names with that.
<br />
<br />I looked into it and it actually sounds like it'd be interesting to program for. I wouldn't really start anything you could classify as a "project" with it, as 4k is pretty much just enough to hold a small minigame. But it'd definitely be a sort of "boot camp" to my programming/optimization skills.

<br />It's actually 20 bits. If you don't change the background registers (2 8-bit and 1 4-bit) in the middle of a scanline, the second half will be either a copy or a reflection of the first half (you select this with another register). And you can't double it. That's the resolution, 40 (really wide) pixels.
<br />
<br />The 2600 is actually pretty fun to work with. The real challenge is that it doesn't have a PPU, like the NES, that does graphics processing, so you have to do it yourself with 6502 code. This means you need a very specific piece of code, the kernel, to work with the few video registers available during rendering and simulate a PPU. And then you have only VBlank available to run your game logic, so it's pretty much the opposite of how we do with the NES.
<br />
<br />But yes, I do find AtariAge a good place to discuss 2600 programming. They've been very helpful everytime I asked something.
