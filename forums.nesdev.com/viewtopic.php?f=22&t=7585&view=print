<br />
<br />Also, something technical: your format for the gamebackground data could be significantly compressed without using RLE or anything as well.  I don't know what range of values you need (in your example you're only using $0 to $2), but I'll assume you need values $0-$F (0-15).  You could combine 2 metatiles into a single byte (e.g. what you would declare now as $F,$2,$1,$0,$0,$0 would become $F2,$10,$00) with very little CPU overhead (bitshifts take care of all the complexity).  Something to think about, especially given the ROM space savings per screen.
<br />
<br />Of course, if you actually need more than a nybble ($0-$F) for your tile numbers this won't work.  In that case you might consider a simple RLE method.  What I used in the FF2e/j intro was pretty simple and made a huge difference when there were lots of repetitive tiles of the same value.  Had to use this in my case since there wasn't enough free ROM space.

I recently struggled with this myself. For your game you won't have gravity, and your velocities may be constant, but the sequence of steps needed for correct background collision and response is there.
<br />
<br />Also I admire someone that can come up with a good, unique idea for a game and implement it without a mapper. Every time I sit down to design a game I end up with something that reads "remake [name of awesome commercial game] but make it WAY cooler!" Not very practical or feasible <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Good luck!

<br />I have never thought about this, but it sounds very interesting and indeed something for me to consider, thanks for the tip.

<br />The techniques I'm using are:
<br />a. Write #$F0 to all sprite entry's Y-position first of all.
<br />b. skip 7 entries (28 bytes) between sprite writes. 
<br />c. add 24 entries (96 bytes) to the OAM start address each frame.
<br />
<br />And I was alternating the write order (first to last and last to first) each frame but I did not see improvements, so I skipped it.

<br />You might save some CPU time by only doing this to the unused sprites, once you're finished defines the ones you will use. If your game is really busy and lots of sprites are being used, you certainly don't want to waste time hiding sprites just to bring them back into view later.

<br />I use this techniques too (but not exactly).
<br />Except a, that I clear remaining sprites only as suggested by tokumaru.
<br />I alternate the write order because if your objects use more than 64 (63 for me as I skip sprite 0) sprites you can draw up to 128 by alternating the order.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OAM cycling is a bit weird for me, because sometimes I need to preserve the priorities between the sprites of an object (and sometimes even between different objects). To solve this, instead of "randomizing" the sprite slots, I randomize the order in which the objects are processed and rendered. I'm not sure if this looks better or worse than the other way, I haven't tested it much.
<br />
<br />I also have 2 virtual sprite layers. When objects call the sprite rendering function they specify whether the sprites should go on the top layer or the bottom layer. This causes the function to output the sprites to the bottom end or to the top end of the OAM buffer ($200-$2FF). Since the top layer has priority, I avoid putting sprites there unless they absolutely need to be in front of all other objects.

<br />Ok, sounds very reasonable, I'll do it. But how did you guys think it looked, I can't remember playing any game with this obvious sprite flickering.

<br />Looks about right to me. There's no miraculous OAM cycling technique that will make it look like the NES is able to display 16 sprites in a row... flickering will look bad no matter how you do it.
<br />
<br />You probably don't remember this much flickering in commercial games because when things are moving and you are in the middle of playing there's too much going on for you to focus on the flickering. But when everything is static like in your ROM you have nothing to do but stare at the flickering and notice how ugly it looks.
