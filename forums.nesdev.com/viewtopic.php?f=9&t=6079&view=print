		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello all together,
<br />
<br />yesterday I had the idea that a mouse for NES would be useful for a hand full of games (e.g. Manic Manson). So I searched for it but couldn't find a mouse. Has anyone ever developed a mouse for NES?
<br />
<br />So I had another idea. I can get a SNES-Mouse for  ~5â‚¬ at German ebay.
<br />The pinout for NES / SNES you can find here <a href="http://www.gamesx.com/controldata/nessnes.htm" class="postlink">http://www.gamesx.com/controldata/nessnes.htm</a> so it won't be a problem to change the mouse to NES.
<br />
<br />The only problem is that the mouse doesn't work with every SNES-Game.
<br />But I don't know what happens if you plug the mouse in together with a non supported game - nothing?
<br />So I guess that non NES game would support the mouse. Any idea how to make a work-around?
<br />
<br />I already asked in a German NES board but they don't have any idea.

<br />
<br />You could also add a small uC in between the mouse and the nes that converts all mouse movements to d-pad events but i doubt it would be usable

<br />
<br />Yeah I like to use it with existing games. I'm not sure how good a mouse can replace a dpad.
<br />
<br />Could you explain me what a Uc is? (sry English isn't my mother tongue)
<br />Is it a micro controller? I guess that would be to hard for me (cuz I don't have any experience with electro technics).
<br />
<br />Or is there anyone that can help me to build it? (I hope so)

<br />
<br />So we have to wait for someone that is able to build and program such an adapter. Sadfully I'm not. I guess some people in this board have the know-how. Maybe it's possible that the adapter can handle both - Old games (with a trick) and new games with fitting instructions.
<br />
<br />If someone puts our plans into pratice I'd help as good as I can 
<br />(That's just wirering and soldering so far so I just can rebuild)

The Fairlight release of Mario Paint went the other way: the trainer made it compatible with the standard controller.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If someone puts our plans into pratice I'd help as good as I can <br />(That's just wirering and soldering so far so I just can rebuild)</div>
<br />As far as I can tell, the adapter would just involve cutting off one end of a Super NES extension cord and one end of an NES extension cord and soldering the corresponding wires together, or cutting up an NES controller and Super NES mouse and putting some sort of standard connector in the middle (like the inline release on an original Xbox controller) so that one can swap their plugs. I suggested the clock filter circuit only to make it possible to hack games that use the DPCM channel for drums or display timing.

<br />Don't forget Shadowgate, Deja Vu, Uninvited, Linus Spearhead's Cosmic Crusade &amp; King's Quest V as games that would be improved with mouse support.  I think that adding a crosshair to Zapper games may prove difficult on the NES.  I don't think that the gaming experience would improve with Zelda or Rad Racer, the first has control that is a tad loose and for the latter, they seldom benefit without something like a wheel.  
<br />
<br />Sampled drums?  I would think that Maniac Mansion utilizes them.

<br />I wasn't aware of that, as I had never played it. In that case we <em>would</em> need the double-clocking protection circuit.

Just needs to be plugged in and have some software for it.  A while back I put DB9 connectors on both an NES and SNES controller connector for various experiments like this.  If I had known it at the time, I could have made it Famiclone controller compatible too. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />There are NES trackballs, but no mice. You might be able to mod a Commodore 1350 Mouse (which uses Atari-style digital signals) to work, but you'll have some wiring to do in order to make the second button work, not to mention add buttons for Start/Select. 
<br />
<br />Note that I say the C1350, not 1351. The 1351 is an analogue mouse, whereas the 1350 is digital-only, albeit rarer than the 1351 that replaced it. 
<br />
<br />A trackball is a better option for you, as there are a handful that were made for both the NES and the Famicom.

It came with one game, a multi cart obviously, only it was a win95 clone-look-a-like! word proccessing, music maker? BASIC! the regular controller doesnt work with the game, only the mouse. it has some more interesting programs on it also, but the most supprising was a nes basic port and the mouse!
<br />its all in chinese btw... if anyone wants some pictures ill be more then happy to find the gear and post =p
<br />anyone else seen or heard of these clones???

<br />Stuff like that has already been dumped... Look for "Windows 2000" in <a href="http://cah4e3.shedevr.org.ru/dumping_2009.php" class="postlink">this page</a>. I believe there is more if you keep browsing. I don't remember if any emulators support that kind of mouse though.

<br />it's those units that playpower.org is targeting
<br />
<br />might actually be a good idea to use the same interface if possible. I don't know if it reverseengineered yet but i think the playpower project be happy if someone did it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />does anyone know where to get one of those clones in europe?
