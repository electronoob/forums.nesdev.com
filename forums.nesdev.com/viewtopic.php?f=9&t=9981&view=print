		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm attempting to purchase a Super 8 from eBay but the seller's Paypal account seems to not accept payments. The seller has 50670 reviews with a 99.5% feedback rating so this is odd. Has anyone bought a Super 8 from cheapgamestuff on eBay before? I'm wondering if this is a problem with the seller's Paypal account being suspended. I sent the seller a message to try and see what's going on. If I don't hear back in a day or two, I'll file a cancellation with eBay. It doesn't matter to me where I get a Super 8. I've just been wanting to play NES and Famicom games on my North American SNES.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The incompatibility is a thing, but the fact you'd have to use a different power supply and different video cables really makes me wonder what is the advantage of plugging this in the SNES at all. The only real annoyance of owning multiple video game consoles is having to switch those cables regulary when you change the system you're using (most TVs doesn't have more than 3 AV inputs) - and I use the same supply for NES and SNES. The controllers is the only thing you don't dupicate - but it's not a huge advantage considering that games were originally designed for different controllers.<br /><br />If such an adapter would use the SNES for the power supply and graphics, it would be worth purshasing (even with incompatibilities and co) but then Byuu said it's impossible due to limited bandwith from cart to VRAM, the super gameboy is very close to using the maximum possible bandwith (remember that data can only be transferred during VBlank).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From what I've seen, it's compatible with most games including Akumajō Densetsu which is fairly uncommon for a famiclone. I have a North American NES, but no Famicom. I mainly wanted to play Castlevania 3 with the enhanced sound from Konami's VCR6. If there is a mod for the NES to allow playing the enhanced sound, that might be the cheapest option.<br /><br />EDIT: I forgot to mention that it does not require an extra power supply and it supports composite video.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok if it does not require extra power supply it's a tad better, but it still requires an extra video cable.<br /><br />I imagine that most famiclones are &quot;comapible&quot; with Akumajo Densetu while most are not compatible with Castlevania III.<br />Yes it's the same game but on a completely different mapper, the VRC6 is much simpler and more conventional than the MMC5 and less likely to break on famiclones.<br /><br />Also I said compatible between bracket because I honestly doubt any famiclones have the external sound supported. If anyone could confirm or infirm this it would be great.<br />But since most clones did not bother to carry the CIRAM /CE signal to the cart connector (breaking games with 4 screen mirroring) I would not be surprised if they did not bother to bring the audio too (breaking games with external audio - they'll run but without the extra audio channels).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From the video reviews I've seen on Youtube, it looks as though Castlevania III with the MMC5 mapper works with the Super 8. Also, I believe that the A/V feeds from the SNES into the Super 8 and you can use you A/V cable from your SNES to connect the Super 8 to a TV.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I finally got the Paypal transaction to go through with the Super 8 I found on eBay. I'm looking forward to its arrival. I've been on a nostalgia trip lately and have been craving some good non-emulated 8-bit and 16-bit action on my TV. <br /><br />I'm not concerned on 100% compatibility, but if it can play the good majority of NES/Famicom games, that will suffice for my needs. I may end up getting a true Famicom at some point later if necessary. I know that lots of people have the Super 8 and it's been around a while, but once I get mine, I'll post my findings and look at doing a small review on my blog.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had a Super 8 for a long time, I never noticed any compatibility issues although I wasn't testing tons of games on it. From what I understood it had one of the better NOAC for compatibility.<br /><br />You will never be able to get anything better than composite video though, and it did ad more interference. I never liked how loose the connection was for the output connection either.<br /><br />As for convenience though, it was great.<br /><br />The Ebay seller you are purchasing from has lots of good retro peripherals, he has a number of things I'm interested in however his international shipping is ridiculous so I have never dealt with him.

It's too bad that international shipping is high. He does have a bunch of cool stuff for sale.<br /><br />I'm hoping that my Super 8 comes in next week. I plan to get Akumajō Densetsu shortly after and begin building my Famicom collection. I've accumulated quite a few NES games from eBay over the past week or so and am enjoying the 8-bit classics.
