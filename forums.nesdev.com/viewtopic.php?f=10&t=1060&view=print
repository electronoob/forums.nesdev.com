		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Lately I've been working with my main character sprite and its movements.
<br />I've done simple things like make my character duck and move side to
<br />side witout any problems.  For the duck I just replaced my tiles with the
<br />tiles combined to make the character look like he is ducking.  I've run
<br />into a little bit of a snag with moving left and right as far as changing the
<br />different sprite tiles go.  All my movements are happening inside NMI.
<br />I have 3 different sets of sprite tiles for the characters legs ( to give the
<br />illusion that the character is walking).  When I press left (even once) it goes
<br />through all 3 sets extremely quick.
<br />
<br />This is what I have.  If you don't mind .. could you tell me if this is the right
<br />way or if there is a better way to go about this.  Thanks.

<br />lord_Chile, you don't do that with the compiler/assembler. You don't "make" the .sav file. When your NES program/game uses the memory at $6000-$7FFF you're using extra ram, and the emulator will save that to a file, to simulate the way a batery would keep the data in a real cart.
<br />
<br />If you want to have save ram, just use the ram at $6000-$7FFF.

<br />
<br />it's not a valid instruction...
<br />compiler accept o deny any instructions and just nesasm 2.0 dont recognize store something between $6000 and $7ffff.. thanks i understand how works sram and .sav.. but problem is just compiler needing recognize store in sram.. and nesasm 2 doesnt...

<br />You'll need some delays.  It seems kinda dirty to write code for each animation frame, but the code will run really fast at least, heheh.  Looks like the animation speed is based on the 'isWalking' variable, which is probably being changed too fast (just have it wait X number of frames somehow).
<br />
<br />I wrote some animation code that works pretty well for me, I talked about the data format in this old thread here.

Do it all based on frames instead, with a fixed-point counter you can count frames and still get a high resolution (on average) since the counter wraps-around.<br /><br />Like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">counter: .res 1<br />delay_value = 25 ; lower for more delay<br /><br />&nbsp;lda counter<br />&nbsp;clc<br />&nbsp;adc #delay_value<br />&nbsp;sta counter<br />&nbsp;bcc skip<br />&nbsp;inc isWalking<br />skip:<br /></div><br /><br />It's a good idea to use fixed-point numbers for sprite coordinates also.  So you can move less than a pixel per frame, and actually be moving.<br /><br />  <br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Memblers wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I wrote some animation code that works pretty well for me, I talked about the data format in this old thread here.<br /><a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=493" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=493</a></div><br /><br />I looked over your code.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd say you have to keep a variable that tells what the player is doing, and also defines the animation frame to use for it.
<br />
<br />Say you have 4 frames of animation for the character:
<br />0 - standing;
<br />1-3 - walking;
<br />
<br />The game would start with that variable at 0, with the player just standing there. You'll will check that variable every frame, and while it is 0 you'll jump to the part of the code that draws the guy standing.
<br />
<br />Then, when the player presses right, and there is no wall or anything in the way, you set that variable to the code of the first walking frame, wich is "1". That means the next time you read that variable, you'll jump to the part of the code that draws the guy in his first walking frame.
<br />
<br />Then, every frame (or every few frames, to have slower animation) you update that variable to the next walking frame. And set it back to 0 as soon as the player stops walking.
<br />
<br />The best thing to do is have the animation sync'ed with the player's speed, if you implemented such a thing yet. Have the delay between animation frames get smaller as the player moves faster.
<br />
<br />Well, that's it: have a variable to control what frame of animation to show, maintain/update it every frame as necessary and use it every frame to decide what to draw.

<br />
<br />I use cc65 (with ca65, ld65).  If I typed it completely, that would've gone in the RAM or zeropage segment.  .res reserves bytes, so the linker will assign RAM locations to variables for you.  So just assign it to a free location in RAM.
