Do any stand out to you guys?<br /><br />Please don't recommend Windows, because this might just be me, but programs run so slowly on it for me compared to Ubuntu that it's painful. I should benchmark build time of cc65 as an example, because Windows has taken 10+ minutes before.<br /><br />Also it's hard to build any programs on Windows, so...yeah. No thanks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This thread is a guaranteed slow-motion train wreck.  Nobody can definitively tell you what's best, because that's so incredibly subjective that it's almost pointless to ask.  Here's some proof!  :-)<br /><br />I'e used several versions of Linux, usually in a professional environment (read: as a server, not as a desktop or client).  I've had favourites over the years, but **current** distros are almost all universally junk with the scarily-rapid adoption of systemd.  It's becoming harder and harder to find a well-supported Linux distro that isn't running systemd.  If it doesn't matter to you, then great, but if you ever have to deal with it on even a general level (like <a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=64116" class="postlink">dealing with the journal getting corrupted</a> -- I sure do love Lennart Poeterring's reply!), you'll wish for sysvinit or OpenRC or something else.<br /><br />In general I found Ubuntu 14.04 LTS pretty decent and tolerable.  I had to migrate servers to 16.04 (systemd-based) and would love to send Poeterring a bill for all the man hours I put in to dealing with systemd + trying to avoid it.  I didn't mind older Linux Mint (17.3 Rosa), but I found it to be very desktop-centric rather what I prefer (bare-bones and server-focused); it did work, but getting rid of all the &quot;desktop junk&quot; bordered on risky.<br /><br />I've stayed away from Debian for a while now.  I took a look at Devuan, the non-systemd Debian fork, except I found its general support to be pretty abysmal; for example, ZFS support is highly neglected, being apparently maintained by some guy with a name that looks like something a 13-year-old script kiddie would use and who <a href="https://bugs.devuan.org//cgi/pkgreport.cgi?which=pkg&amp;data=zfs" class="postlink">has ignored major/critical issues reported to him over a year ago</a>.<br /><br />In short: the distros that tend to have the best overall support (from vendors) tend to be Ubuntu, RedHat, and CentOS.  I still can't take Gentoo seriously (the arguments for it are always &quot;but Portage is awesome&quot;, to which I reply: I've used FreeBSD since 1997, where do you think they got the idea from?  Ports/Portage ain't enough to justify use of an OS, sorry).  I generally find them all pretty &quot;bleh&quot; at this point in time, but use Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 (as servers) exclusively at work, and that's mainly because AWS has good support for them.<br /><br />Run whatever distro works best for you.  If you don't know what that is?  Spend several weeks installing them all one by one and trying them.  Or try them on a VM (won't be quite the same as bare metal, but it'll at least get you familiar).

Nobody can definitively tell you what's best, because that's so incredibly subjective that it's almost pointless to ask.</div><br />Hence why this was asked on a forum, not a Q&amp;A site. I read it as &quot;Of the distributions you have tried, what about it worked for you and what did not?&quot; But my Q&amp;A site habits are still leaking out my fingertips, so let me get this one out of the way first:<br /><br />&quot;My partition for desktop GNU/Linux is too small. How can I choose a distribution to make it bigger?&quot;<br />You may have hit an <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/66378/229356" class="postlink">XY problem</a>. This means you ask for help with details of a particular solution when a completely different class of solution that you had not anticipated may suit your underlying problem better.<br /><br />If you're running out of space in general, my first recommendation is to run <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">du</tt> on your home directory to figure out where most of your stuff is stored. If system directories outweigh your home directory, that means your partition might be too small. But otherwise, you can move large files to another partition or to external mass storage. Or you can clear various caches, such as that of your web browser or running <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">make clean</tt> on your programming projects.<br /><br />But with that said, if you're stuck on a relatively small partition, such as if you're trying to make a desktop GNU/Linux distribution share a laptop's small SSD with the Windows 10 that came with the laptop, I recommend Xubuntu. Its Xfce desktop avoids the excess bloat of things like Unity (default in 11.10 through 16.04) and GNOME 3 (beginning in 18.04), and it may fit into a smaller partition. But I have no first-hand experience using recent desktop Debian or Ubuntu in a partition smaller than about 50 GB, though I've used Ubuntu 8.04 (with GNOME 2) on a netbook's 4 GB SSD before.<br /><br />As for just using Windows 10 on the desktop and GNU/Linux on the server, one of the advantages of GNU/Linux on a software development workstation is that you don't need to connect to the Internet or carry a Raspberry Pi around with you to test server code that you write that exceeds the capability of WSL. Nor do you waste as much time on the staging server working around differences between the Windows and UNIX versions of your favorite server programming language's standard library, which would be the case if you test on Perl, Python, PHP, or Node for Windows and deploy on Perl, Python, PHP, or Node for GNU/Linux. Nor does testing graphical applications require downloading a ten-year-old unmaintained copy of Xming, which you would have to do on Windows because WSL lacks an X server.<br /><br />In addition, Windows 10 tends to be a bandwidth hog around update time. It gives the end user little or no notice that it is about to download a semiannual upgrade and thereby cause the ISP to bill the subscriber for monthly data transfer quota overages, not to mention the loss of unsaved state that an unattended restart represents. (If there were more notice, the user could drive the computer into town and perform the upgrade on the county library's unmetered Internet.) Unlike Windows 10, Ubuntu gives about 3 months of notice for the semiannual upgrade track, and the 2-year upgrade track of Debian and Ubuntu does not carry a surcharge.<br /><br />As for just using Windows 7 on the desktop, the security updates for Windows 7 are due to end in two years, and a newly purchased laptop will have neither the drivers nor the downgrade rights to run old Windows.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If [avoiding Poetterix] doesn't matter to you, then great, but if you ever have to deal with it on even a general level (like <a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=64116" class="postlink">dealing with the journal getting corrupted</a> -- I sure do love Lennart Poeterring's reply!)</div><br />I love it too because I see his point. I don't see the problem with using EOF as a marker to contain the corruption at write time. This way, later versions of the reading program can include improved error correction without having to correct for both the original error and the old version of the reading program's attempt to fix it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I still can't take Gentoo seriously (the arguments for it are always &quot;but Portage is awesome&quot;, to which I reply: I've used FreeBSD since 1997, where do you think they got the idea from?
