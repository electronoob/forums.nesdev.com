Psychopathicteen's suggestion for native hardware long pointer load/store will help with this a little ... you free up one or two banks formerly for data, but code banks will still be a limitation.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been thinking about jump / load / store long instructions (&quot;long access&quot;). I think a very reasonable addition would be to have the requested bank index in R0 for these instructions. If the OS is handling bank allocation, each process will have its own list of bank indexes (range from $0000-$FFFF), and the compiler will allocate data/text segments and generate long access opcodes as appropriate. These instructions will raise a 'long access' interrupt, and the OS will have to use R0 and the upper bits of the generated address to place the appropriate bank in virtual memory.<br /><br />Broken out:<br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>At some point during initialization, a process informs the OS that it is requesting a new bank of free memory, which it will refer to as bank $20.</li><li>The OS reserves HW device $02, bank $05 for this bank.</li><li>During execution, the process executes a 'jump long' instruction with R0 = $20 and Address = $F040.</li><li>YCPU raises 'long access' interrupt with R0 = $20 and P2 = $F040.</li><li>OS checks its list of banks for this process. This process stores it's bank $20 in HW device $02, bank $05.</li><li>OS uses MMW instructions to switch in this bank in virtual address space $F000-$FFFF.</li><li>OS transfers control back to the process.</li></ol><br />This would be a fairly expensive operation in terms of cycles, but it would allow access to 32-bits of physical address space while maintaining 16-bit registers.

It's not so different than the traditional desktop &quot;trying to load data/execute code that has been paged to disk&quot;, only you don't need to stall the process while the kernel loads the data back into RAM.<br /><span style="font-size: 80%; line-height: normal"><br />(At one point for a class assignment I was tasked with designing an MMU, and I chose the lazy/minimalist way out: the PC had a minimum possible value, a maximum possible value, and if anything caused it to go out of bounds it would fault. All loads and stores would fault. Needless to say, my instructor was <em>not</em> pleased.)</span><br /><br />I suspect the overhead of faulting on every access isn't really acceptable for data, though.

At this point I'm satisfied with the specification, and barring the discovery of additional errors, I don't see anything changing. Progress on the emulator has been slow, but as of this morning I have the entire thing implemented in software, except for the RTC, Hardware bus, and raising the 'UnPriv Opcode' interrupt while in User mode.<br /><br />In this update are a complete specification for the RTC, updates to the MMU, and new instructions that will help with changing the context of the processor.<br /><br />I added 'P' present and 'A' accessed bits to help with bank management.<div class="quotetitle">2.F.3. THE MMU CACHE wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; A - Access flag:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This bit is set every time this bank is written to.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; P - Not present flag:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If this bit is set, any access to this bank will raise a bank fault.</div></div><br />I specified the state of the U, W, and E bits on bank fault:<div class="quotetitle">2.F.5.

You get the current time using the HWQ instruction, and can enable/disable the interrupt, as well as specify the interrupt frequency of the CLOCK interrupt.<div class="quotetitle">2.H. The Real Time Clock wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">The processor contains an integrated Real Time Clock (RTC). The RTC maintains<br />and updates its internal time data indefinitely, even when the processor is<br />powered down. The processor can query the RTC for the current time.<br /><br />The clock provides time data with the following precision:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Year:&nbsp; &nbsp; 8 bits (0-255)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Month:&nbsp; &nbsp;4 bits (0-11)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Day:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5 bits (0-31)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Hour:&nbsp; &nbsp; 5 bits (0-23)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Minute:&nbsp; 6 bits (0-59)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Second:&nbsp; 6 bits (0-59)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Tick:&nbsp; &nbsp;16 bits (0-65535)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />The RTC also provides a CLOCK interrupt, which can be enabled, disabled, and the<br />frequency of which can be specified. When the RTC interrupt is enabled, the RTC<br />will raise the CLOCK interrupt at an interval which is specified by the<br />processor. The RESET interrupt disables the RTC.</div></div><br />The new 'JCX' instruction allows the processor to change the entirety of the memory space and jump into user mode:<br /><div class="quotetitle">3.H. Jump &amp; Call Instructions wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">JCX&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unconditional Jump and change Context<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. A pointer to a 32-word array of MMU data is popped from the stack.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. The MMU is loaded with the data in the 32-word array.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. The value iPS is popped from the stack.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. The remaining registers are popped from the stack in this order:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SP, R6, R5, R4, R3, R2, R1, R0, FL, PC<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 5. PS is set to iPS.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 6. Execution continues.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; NOTE: The following operations are the equivalent of 'save context':<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PSH R7, R6, R5, R4, R3, R2, R1, R0, FL, PC<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; TSR R0, PS<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PSH R0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ; determine the address where the 32-word MMU cache will be saved.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LOD R0, {Address of 32-word MMU cache store location}<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; MML R0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PSH R0</div></div><br />One other big change: I've though a ton about how interrupts should work. The supervisor memory state should be switched into memory so it can handle the interrupt, but the previous memory state should be maintained. Here's my solution:<br /><br />On an interrupt, the processor saves the current PS, enters supervisor mode, and disables the MMU. The memory space is as follows:<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">While the 'Memory Banking' status bit is clear, the MMU is disabled, and the<br />processor's address space is mapped as follows:&#91;quote=&quot;2.F.1. ADDRESS SPACE WHEN THE MMU IS DISABLED&quot;&#93;&#91;code&#93;&nbsp; &nbsp; Bank $0 - If R status bit is clear, Internal ROM Bank $00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If R statis bit is set, Internal RAM Bank $00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Bank $1 - Internal RAM Bank $01<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Bank $2 - Internal RAM Bank $02<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Bank $E - Internal RAM Bank $0E<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Bank $F - Internal RAM Bank $0F</div><br />Because this is a known state, the OS can plan out what data and routines it needs to have in memory to handle interrupts - and has the entire address space available to put this data in. Because the MMU cache hasn't been changed, the processor can either leave it unchanged and the pre-interrupt memory space will be 100% restored when the M status bit is set again, or save the MMU cache (easy to do with MML/MMS) if the OS needs to load different memory space.

But it didn't store the value while power was off, and had a minimum frequency of 18Hz. The other was added with the 286 AT, and is something equivalent to the MC146818, a conventional RTC, so it's only programmable to interrupt frequencies at powers of 2, 1 to 8192 Hz, as well as 1/min and 1/hr.<br />Modern PCs have added what they call an HPET because the 18 Hz minimum of the 8253, and the coarseness of the RTC's interrupts, didn't allow for the full range of sleep periods OS kernels wanted for reduced power consumption.
