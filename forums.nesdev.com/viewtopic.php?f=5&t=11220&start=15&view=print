The more efficiently I pack programs, the more category 3 entries we can include on a 4 Mbit cart. I have source code for SFX Editor. Are there any parts of RAM that PCB Artist and Theremin are guaranteed not to use, so that I can use those addresses for NMI dispatch?

If your emulator doesn't play mapper 28, change the mapper to 34 and everything but Theremin should still work.<br /><br />My next steps:<br /><ul><li>Make tool to combine two NROM-128 games into one bank (which is a lot simpler for mapper 28 than mapper 34) </li><li>Patch Denine's entries to explicitly set mirroring </li><li>Start adding category 3 </li><li>Keep polishing RHDE </li></ul>

The gimmicks are unpredictable, it's next to impossible to return a serve, there's no way to control the direction of the return, etc. </li><li>Sliding Blaster quality: Severe control issues without a mouse. The developer has reassured me that he will work on this once the school year ends in a few weeks. </li></ul><br />As <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2012/apr/27/shigeru-miyamoto-rushed-game-forever-bad" class="postlink">Shigeru Miyamoto put it</a>: &quot;A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.&quot; Action 52 was rushed, and I want to be one better. Consider that the first Action 53 volume drew from two compos (see &quot;I Wanna Flip the Sky&quot; for the other) and had ample time to fill its equivalent of category 3.<br /><br />Finally, a lesson learned: Require app entries in the next compo to route NMI through a vector in RAM.

(Pong 198x title): </div><br /><br />Yeah I brought this up with WhatULive4 previously.  I appreciate the entry to the compo, and think we should still award the special edition cartridge.  However, because of the trademark/copyright issues, it's not safe for us to include in the multicart.  I beleive this falls along the lines of how we intended to handle entries if they didn't have appropriate material.  Submit whatever you please into the compo, but it's not guaranteed to be included on the multi cart.  If the trademark/copyright issues were removed, along with the frustrations I would be willing to entertain it's inclusion to the cart.<br /><br />I could go either way on Sliding blaster.  If the developer has bigger and a more complete game play planned, I'd question if they'd really like to include a partial build.  Putting a partial game in this year will only tarnish a complete game in a future cart.

I kind of miss seeing a game by Shiru. So would it be OK to include this? (it's marked &quot;Public Domain&quot;)<br /><br />As for the headliner, oddly enough I'm always thinking of DABG because of the word &quot;action&quot;.
