If you choose BP, the default segment is SS instead of DS.<br /><br />The &quot;base&quot; and &quot;index&quot; names are for remembering which registers are allowed in each column.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, I'm just curious, but are hardware registers like ax zeroed out on startup? It's not the end of the world, I'm honestly just curious if I should do it or not for one occasion. Also, I think I heard something like &quot;mov ax, 0x0000&quot; is as fast as &quot;xor ax, ax&quot; on the 80186, or am I wrong? I suppose it doesn't matter, I just personally like the look of &quot;mov ax, 0x0000&quot; better.<br /><br />You know though, I'm trying to get sprites to display now, but I remembered the problem... I know the format for each sprite ram entry, (it's on the last page of the topic I linked) but does anyone remember how &quot;sprite control&quot; works? I remember there's a &quot;switch&quot; that DMA's a part of ram (0xF8000) to wherever to make sprites display, but I don't remember what bit does this at what register, and we never figured out how this works, because I remember I tried to activate it during active display and nothing happened, so I tried during vblank, but that's when that wasn't working.

I remember I went to some MAME forum and asked them some stuff about this, and they basically told me that they didn't have a clue and that I should look at the &quot;official&quot; MAME developer's forum and asked, but it's one of those places where you sign up and wait to be approved, and I checked it after two weeks and I had still never been verified... I have a sad feeling that I know just about as much as this arcade board as anyone else...

You run your vblank &quot;handler&quot; after every interrupt, whether it's vblank or not. Code that needs to run during vblank needs to go in the vblank handler, especially now that you're working with sprites and receiving an interrupt from that as well.<br /><br />Of course, if you run any code in an interrupt handler, you must save and restore any registers it changes. Fortunately, the V33 is compatible with the 80186, which means you can use <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">pusha</tt> and <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">popa</tt> to save and restore all 7 of the general-purpose registers. You'll probably want to access memory (or memory-mapped hardware) during vblank, so you'll also need to save and restore at least one segment register.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What does it mean be &quot;(negative)&quot;?</div><br />It means this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">m_sprite_list = (((0x100 - m_spritecontrol&#91;0&#93;) &amp; 0xff) * 4);</div>You wrote -1, so you should get 1 sprite.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I have a sad feeling that I know just about as much as this arcade board as anyone else...</div><br />If anyone knows more, they haven't fixed the remaining bugs in MAME's implementation.
