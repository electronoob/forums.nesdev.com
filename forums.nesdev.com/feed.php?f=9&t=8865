By looking at the files, it looks every .CMD  file has a 5-byte header. Maybe they contain the start address of the program.<br /><br />The best way to dump it would be removing the ROM from the motherboard and dump it. But it would be quite hard and you may damage it, so no.<br /><br />The other way, funnier and safer is tryingto reverse-engineer the .CMD file format, then write a program to read every byte from the BIOS ROM and write it to the floppy.<br /><br />TREE.CMD is quite small and reads stuff from the floppy, so I think it is the best file we can try to reverse-engineer.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4431">socram8888</a> — Sat May 05, 2012 1:47 pm</p><hr />

I tried this morning to do everything possible to run some NES ROMs on it but no results. I also tried to see the differences between the files of Dr PC Jr.<br /><br />Below is what has been tried and the result:<br /><br />1) Forcing the loading of SMDOS.SYS (Dr PC Jr.) along with their respective COMMAND.CMD, the system hangs on a green screen;<br /><br />2) When trying to load any file with the CMD or EXC of Dr PC Jr, the console crashes;<br /><br />3) When thoroughly research and compare the files of Dr PC Jr with BBGDOS.SYS and COMMAND.CMD, I realized that the base is the same, just the strings has changed and there is a difference in size and initial spacing at first, it may call the program in another address memory;<br /><br />4) The console does not load any ROM renamed to FCXXXXXX (with the header set to FC GAMES with 512 bytes), it just continues to look for BBGDOS.SYS;<br /><br />5) I made a small program in F-BASIC to read the address of 0-65535 and display the characters on the screen above the number 32 (in order to not affect the display with special characters), and it only showed portions of BBGDOS. SYS, COMMAND.CMD, BASIC.CMD and basic program that was running;<br /><br />6) I made a series of changes in the header of NES ROMs in all formats known (Pasofami, Famicom, PC Jr Dr etc), and tried to rename the ROM for the extensions CMD, EXC and GAM. Using the extensions EXC and GAM the console give me a error, but with the extension CMD the screen was full of garbage and the machine crashed.<br /><br />I'm guessing this chipset console should be the VT02 or VT03, according to some reading I did, noting the type of IC and composition of the motherboard.<br /><br />Because of all these tests, I ask you:<br /><br />- What is the recommended procedure for doing a DUMP BIOS of this machine?<br />- Has anyone seen any famiclone VT02 or derivative that has the floppy drive?<br />- Could someone send me files from floppy from other famiclones or indicate somewhere to download the files?<br />- Does anyone have another idea to try to load NES ROMs or other executables in this console?<br />- Does anyone know the file extension GAM?<br /><br />I appreciate any help.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5285">mauroxavier</a> — Sat May 05, 2012 7:20 am</p><hr />

BTW, the Realtec EZCOM is from Taiwan, probably both computers are. Realtec made a MD copier based on the same hardware. It has distinction for having a DIN keyboard input, but I don't think it has a modem or serial port like this computer. The OS/BIOS is almost identical though, perhaps stripped down a bit. I've only seen the copier a couple of times when I heavily collected them for the better part of a decade so this computer, never having heard of it, is exceptionally rare worldwide, not just in Brazil.<br /><br />At the time in Taiwan it was common for many kids to not own a console but instead go to their local game store which had booths set up and rent them for a period of time. Those who could afford the mammoth cost of a game console and copier had to purchase games on disk for an inflated price. Perhaps there was some kind of server download or rental system implemented/planned with the modem since the profit margins are higher without actually having to sell a floppy disk. This would have been a very cool thing to see! Taiwan has its own little ecosystem of strange game hardware (both console add-ons and copying hardware) for this rental scheme that I found fascinating.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Fri May 04, 2012 10:34 am</p><hr />

Hello, friends.<br /><br />I joined this forum to have your help so that they can give me more details about a curious famiclone I bought yesterday.<br /><br />It was manufactured in 1997 by "BBG Electronics Corp Ltd", a Chinese company (or Thai?)<br /><br />Anyway, see all the photos and items that came with the kit:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://picasaweb.google.com/113745604411454851948/FamicloneBBGElectronics">https://picasaweb.google.com/1137456044 ... lectronics</a><!-- m --><br />I apologize for the comments on the photos are in my native language (pt-br).<br /><br />This "Famiclone BBG" should be a "clone of a clone", a derivation of Dr PC Jr:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mypage.direct.ca/c/ccovell/nesdev.html">http://mypage.direct.ca/c/ccovell/nesdev.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I used a hex editor and saw that the files it looks like the Dr. PC Jr., but are not identical. If I'm try to run the .CMD or .EXC from Dr. PC Jr, the machine freeze.<br /><br />Nor could run NES games yet, in the scheme of Dr. PC Jr. (as his website) did not work.<br /><br />The Basic of this famiclone is very poor, the commands for games and everything else there are not present (sprite, music etc), something that has in the Basic of Dr PC Jr and Family Basic 3.0. If I can at least run the Dr PC Jr Basic will be cool.<br /><br />DOS seems to be a clone of MS-DOS 2.0, it is very fast and has some commands that do the trick, including formatting, copying of records and transfer of the operating system.<br /><br />PS.: I have another clone also interesting, called "EZCOM Realtec". It is a SEGA Genesis clone with keyboard and floppy, and he runs the BIN format ROMs up to 4 Mbytes (using multiple floppy disks), and also makes backups, connects to the Internet using dial-up (with mini browser and e-mail reader), emulates VT-100 terminal using the serial port and allows connection of hard disk and CD-ROM via the parallel port., but did not come with a floppy with DOS and Basic (called Z-Basic), if anyone knows anything, please let me know.
