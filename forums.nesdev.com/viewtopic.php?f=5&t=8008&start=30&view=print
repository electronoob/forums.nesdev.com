<br />
<br />Yeah, I think this discussion (inevitably with this kind of question) quickly becomes kind of a semantics debate.  What is art, what is "not art", and what is programming.
<br />
<br />My philosophy is that art and science are 2 sides of the same coin.. or think of it as a yin-yang, if that makes more sense.  You can't really have one without the other, I think.  A musician could hardly write a song without using the concepts left behind by Pythagoras.  A painter couldn't paint without someone having used a method to discover what materials can create what color.
<br />
<br />And we can hardly have science without creating a hypothesis (sort of an expression of belief, I suppose), and inventing experiments to prove or disprove them.  Surely there is a bit of art in those processes.  Otherwise someone could create a computer program to create hypothesis and design experiments, and eventually we would know the answer to everything - that probably won't happen. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />So yeah, just like no one will claim that creating a soundtrack to an NES game is a science, it's able to work because it's using a very specific bit of audio code and/or look-up tables.  And in the same way, programming a game requires a good deal of artistic vision to design it in the first place.  If it can't be said that implementing physics in code is art (or maybe it can?), or writing a PPU scroller, for sure applying those physics or scroller into the gameplay is an art.
<br />
<br />So I've abstained from voting, because I feel like I could vote either way.  (but I'd tend towards yes, because of the implications of asking here, where we program games)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />design a full system from scratch is, IMHO, a form a art. anyway, which are the feelings or emotions behind Andy Warhol's soup cans or Jackson Pollock's pictures? i think that everything that came up from human's creation is a form of art, and programming it's all about creation, coding is just the last touch. i bet that there's a lot of people in this forum who are better programmer than Bill Gates, but he's on top because i had lots of great ideas, and that's because he was creative. so, voted for YES (:

<br />
<br />If you look at the code, it will only "throw_up" on an "overflow" flag. It was on purpose.  But it would always overflow because it couldn't "control itself" because it was never implemented, or in other words, has no self control.
<br />
<br />At the end I wanted to put an rts after the throw_up label to say that it could actually end up out of control since it was not a function and we don't know what is the last value on the stack, so the the rest of the job (in that case cleaning) would have never been done but it would have been a far fetch. But still.
<br />
<br />As for the actual question, this is an eternal debate that will go nowhere so I better not get into it.
