<br />It's weird because according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_name" class="postlink">wikipedia</a> Japan was one of the late countries to addopt the usage of family names.
<br />
<br />Also, it's quite common here to call people by their family name. Typically someone is called by his first name inside the family, because everyone have the same family name obviously, and by the family name at work/scool because it's likely someone else have the same surname, but not likely someone else have the same family name. Someone with a surname which isn't too comon could be called by both unpreferably.
<br />
<br />I think it has nothing to do with how close you are. For example consider someone named John Smith, John being his first name and Smith his family name. Then it would probably sound more polite/distant to call him "Mr. John" than to call him plain "Smith".
<br />
<br />I don't have played the Genesis (Genesis is american name for Megadrive right ? This always remember me the rock group) version of BROJ, but I don't want to if it's really horrible. All Megadrive/Genesis music sound horrible anyway from what I've heard. I really can't like FM synthetis.
<br />
<br />And yes, Celius&amp;Tokumaru, I hope your Castlevania/Sonic games respecively will be as great as you hope so. I hope you're not having too much trouble to code objects/enemies as I do with my game engine.

Although it was also called Mega Drive here in Brazil (was it called "Genesis" only in the US? Man, americans really do like to change thing's names), most people in this forum are from the US, and I don't feel like typing both names every time. And although it was not called "Genesis" here, mine was imported from the US, so it had "Genesis" written on it and I got used to both names.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I hope you're not having too much trouble to code objects/enemies as I do with my game engine.</div>
<br />I have done very little of that, but it was enough for me to see that it won't be as simple as I had expected. I wanted the code for most objects to be very short, making use of shared routines most of the time, but it seems there are a lot of details specific to each object.
<br />
<br />It shouldn't be so hard though. Just out of curiosity I've looked at disassemblies of the original Mega Drive (see? I used the other name now! I Guess I'll forever use them interchangeably) games, and the code for each object does seem pretty compact. Well, I'm restructuring my own code in order to make even objects easier to code, so let's just see what happens!

<br />Well, here Mr. [first name] is almost never used, it sounds somewhat hironical. You'd say either [first name] (friend, inside family), [last name] (friend that doesn't like using first names or among a group of people where someone else have the same first name or teacher that isn't very polite), or Mr. [last name] (when being polite, distant).
<br />It's very common to find people with the same first name arround, so it should really be bothersome and confusing using exclusively them. Also it would make it harder to distinguish who is the son of who.
<br />
<br />If you figure sometihing amazing about object please share it in the thread dedicated to this subject. I guess most object can call the same routine if done well (for collision, damage, explosion, moving, etc....)

If talking about a doctor, we also say Dr. [last name]. If we aren't familiar with someone, we'll usually refer to them when speaking to other people by [first name] [last name].

<br />
<br />Yeah, I actually always get the Megadrive and the Master System confused, because we call the Megadrive the Genesis over here. It's weird. We do change the names of stuff a lot.
<br />
<br />I, too am thinking about AI and all that. Handling objects makes you think about a lot, and you have to think about everything, which makes you juggle ideas around and it's a headache.

<br />In that case is not because they like to change the name (which americans often do) but for legal reasons. The name megadrive what owned by another company in the US and they had to change the name. The same thing happened for the game Biohazard (Resident Evil) and I'm sure for many other cases.

<br />It doesn't have anything to do with keigo, when they rebooted the character in Dead or Alive, they specifically chose Hayabusa instead of his given name as with the other characters. I don't know exactly why, but they did.

<br />
<br />After second thought, if we look when DAO came out and how the Ryu name was "abused", Hayasbusa make it more stand out from the crowd.  You must be right then. When I think Ryu, the first game that came to my mind is Street Fighter so I guess Tecmo must have changed it for that reason. But I'm only speculating here.

<br />Yes if this was a beat-em up game I remember it had a nice techno track that used well the FM hardware (if it's not then I'm confusing it). But then FM is limited to techno only or bad song, which is more limited than sampling which allow both for classical or modern oriented music.
<br />PSG like on the NES also allow both classical-like music (Dragon Quest) or rock-like music (Battletoads).

<br />
<br />Sounds the same as what I think, as a writer of horrendous songs on every general type of sound system, that with sampling (and FM if you're playful enough with the chip) it's really easy to write bad music but still make it sound good (good instrument use).  It's also not hard to find great music that sounds bad (poor instrument use).
<br />
<br />There's equal art and science to chipmusic.  PSG just gives you this clear and distinctive sound, FM and samples both can get really muddied (by design, often).
