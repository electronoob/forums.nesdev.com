Hey there guys, first off i'm new here, i'm new to emulation but i'm definitely not new to software development nor web development. <br /><br />I was looking for a challenge, something totally different then my usual web (app) development for big companies and my love for nostalgia (I own all pre-wii-u nintendo consoles, ps3 and down and a genesis + atari) along with my lack of emulators on my IOS device I started looking how far webbased emulation has gotten. I stumbled upon JSNES by Ben Firshman and that seemed to work quite well on my Iphone 6 plus, i've already talked with him about the project and he was very enthusiastic to see it put to use by someone else and agreed that I can use his code as long as credit is given to him for the hard work.<br /><br />So from there on I started working out what needed to be done, audio was available on firefox or through flash (a no go on IOS), and input was of course keyboard based. Also nobody likes to (or should) host with their emulator for legal reasons (besides home-brew of course). <br /><br />So i came up with IoNes ( get it <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /> ), and though far from finished i'm looking for people who might want to join the ride or give some advice. What does it offer right now:<br /><br />* Rewritten audio engine based on the Web Audio Engine (AudioContext) that enables full audio playback on IOS (but will still need some work)<br />* Touch controlled input based on touchable 'areas' (instead of buttons) <br />* Load roms from your Dropbox account (to bypass limitations of file uploads on IOS)<br />* Almost stable framerate for most tested games<br /><br />Now as previously mentioned i'm not into emulation and am having a hard time figuring save states and such things that are almost mandatory for a emulator to be proper.<br /><br />So in a nutshell i'm not going to write a whole new emulator but want to tap into the great things already created. So from here on I'm curious who's into helping this open source project, maybe has some advice on javascript emulators for the nes in Generic (is Jsnes the best out there?) etc<br /><br />Want to try it yourself? <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/ultimasnake/ioNes">https://github.com/ultimasnake/ioNes</a><!-- m --> download the repository and run anywhere you want<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6803">ultimasnake</a> — Sat Dec 13, 2014 9:22 am</p><hr />
