A "step backwards" debugging feature wouldn't share anything with rewinding except use of the periodic save states. The two features are otherwise different because backwards playback uses a special technique for avoiding constant seeking to go back each successive frame, while stepping backwards for debugging is only done one instruction at a time at the user's request.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Wed Feb 13, 2008 9:34 am</p><hr />

For really long rewind windows, it would become worthwhile  to use blargg's more complicated algorithm that keeps older snapshots with less frequency.

<div class="quotetitle">Memblers wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />A little anecdote.  I remember playing FF3j translated on an emulator years ago (probably in NESticle), saving my game with a savestate.  One time I saved it when walking around, right before getting into an unwinnable battle.  D'oh!  Since I never saved using the game's interface, losing the battle meant all my progress was gone.  For times like that a rewind feature would've been really nice.  But I was more careful about when I saved states in any games after that, heheh.<br /></div><br /><br />Slower paced games will require a larger rewind window, but according to blargg's benchmarks, a 1 minute rewind window is feasible memory and CPU-wise.  That should be far more than enough for any action game.  However, I think that some Final Fantasy battles can last longer than 1 minute.  So that could be a problem.  However, if real-time saves keep the rewind time window with the save, then your situation would have been fix-able as you would load the save which is right at the start of the battle and try to win the battle again, rinse and repeat a few times until you realize that it is un-winnable.  So then you load the save one last time but then rewind right after loading it, just enough to avoid the battle.<br /><br />Hence we have a perfect example of the power of real-time saving and real-time rewinding used together.  You no longer have to worry about quick-saving yourself into a corner.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=94">Jagasian</a> — Tue Jun 07, 2005 8:46 am</p><hr />

I put in a feature request for real-time rewind (we should probably drop the copyrighted name) at the Nintencer forums.  Nintencer is the sucessor to FCE Ultra:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nintencer.fobby.net/">http://nintencer.fobby.net/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />... the author seems to be interested to give it a try.  As far as accuracy and game compatibility go, the FCE Ultra lineage is pretty high up there.  I would even say up in the top 3, but I am sure those more in the know will correct me on that.  It is also one of the most portable NES emulators, and has had ports in the past to: DOS, Windows, Linux, various BSDs, Mac OSX, Solaris, and even the Xbox.  Though currently Nintencer only officially supports Linux and Windows.  It may still compile for other platforms.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=94">Jagasian</a> — Tue Jun 07, 2005 8:04 am</p><hr />
