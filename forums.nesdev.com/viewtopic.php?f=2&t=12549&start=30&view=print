I cut that out and added input tests for several controllers: NES controller, Famicom controller 2 with microphone, Super NES controller, Power Pad, and Four Score. Tests for the analog controllers will follow in a later version.

It doesn't work in any games either, so it's not All Pad's fault. Also I wanted to try unplugging the built-in controllers to test if it detects that, but it's a pain in the butt to do since you have to unscrew a bunch of screws and the plugs on the PCB are hard to unplug. I might try it later sometime though.<br /><br /><strong>Edit:</strong> Fixed typos.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Except for the CPS Fighter, all results were as expected. Thanks for the confirmation.<br /><br />I own a Capcom Fighter Power Stick, which I take to be the U.S. version of the CPS Fighter. It doesn't have a DA15 for Famicom or a 7-pin cord for NES, but it does have a 7-pin cord for Super NES. I'm using it on my NES through a Super NES to NES cable provided by Infinite NES Lives, and all buttons work as expected. Try plugging the Super Famicom side of your CPS-Fighter into your Famicom's exp port through a homemade adapter that goes to D1.<br /><br />A normal Famicom controller's report is as follows:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">AB-+udlr 11111111 11111111...</div><br /><br />A normal SFC controller's report is as follows:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">BY-+udlr AXLR0000 11111111...</div><br /><br />Based on the evidence you've presented so far, the CPS Fighter appears to be doing this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">BY-+udlr 11110000 11111111...</div><br /><br />The 0000 in the low nibble of the second byte triggers detection as SFC, but AXLR are on so that programs using a certain method of DMC glitch avoidance (rereading only when Right is pressed) know when to stop reading. I could make a second tool that displays each serial line's raw report to absolutely confirm this, but if no &quot;standard&quot; controllers are connected, how will the user choose which line to view?<br /><br />&quot;D2&quot; won't work. It needs to be $4017 D1 for games to recognize it. Was that your mistake?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I kind of hoped that the CPS-Fighter would show different results. It behaves differently from normal SFC controllers, for example it doesn't work in my SFC multitap (the one that is shaped like Bomberman's face) and I also had problems with it in the past when I tried to use it in my Famicom homebrew I made (I eventually got it to work by improving the controller reading routine, I still have no idea why it didn't work though).<br /><br />I guess it's time to build a Super Famicom Controller to Famicom Expansion Port Adapter then. I have a spare SNES controller extension cord I can use, but it's missing the Data 3 and 4 pins, they don't seem to be used by the mouse or standard controllers though.<br />I couldn't find a schematic, but judging from the info from the wiki, I guess it should be wired like this if I want to use two SFC controllers or mouse:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Controller 1:<br /><br />&nbsp;Famicom EXP Plug<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; oooo oooo&nbsp; &lt;-GND<br />&nbsp;+5V-&gt; ooooooo|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;||||&nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;||\/&nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;||/\&nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;||||&nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp;+5V-&gt;|OOOO|OOO) &lt;-GND<br /><br />&nbsp;Super Famicom/NES Controller Port 1 (female)<br /><br /><br /><br />Controller 2:<br /><br />&nbsp;Famicom EXP Plug<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;+---+<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; oooo oooo<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp;ooooooo|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; |&nbsp; ||<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp;|+-/--+|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp;||/&nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp;|||&nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; |OOOO|OOO)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;+------+<br />&nbsp;Super Famicom/NES Controller Port 2 (female)<br /></div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> I could make a second tool that displays each serial line's raw report to absolutely confirm this, but if no &quot;standard&quot; controllers are connected, how will the user choose which line to view?</div><br />I don't understand the question, but usually when there are multiple possible scenarios, I just add options to manually pick all possible combinations in the interface.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">&quot;D2&quot; won't work.

I tested the pin with a multimeter just now and it appears I have accidently wired it to pin 11 of the DB-15 port instead of pin 7 for some reason. The Zapper worked in the second NES port though, so I guess it doesn't use the con 2 data pin.

You are already using that for that purpose, couldn't you just display all raw data on that low-level screen thingy?</div><br />I'd be interested to see how you would recommend to do that. At the font size I'm using, the title safe area can fit 28x12 characters. Here's the current layout of lowlevel:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Low-level controller port<br />probing results<br />Reset: return; Start: help<br /><br />PPU readback<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;00 FF 00 FF 00 FF 00 FF<br />PPU latch&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3F 3F 3F 3F 3F<br />APU open bus&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 40 40 3F<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4L 3L 4H 3H D76543210<br />1P:&nbsp; &nbsp; 40 A0 41 A1&nbsp; ...0000S<br />2P:&nbsp; &nbsp; 40 A0 41 A1&nbsp; ...0000S<br /></div><br /><br />In theory, there could be up to seven serial (S) lines on an AV Famicom: devices in controller ports 1 and 2 (D0 of each), and the five input lines on the expansion port (1P D1, 2P D4-D1). The serial devices I currently support are anywhere from 4-bit (Power Pad part 2) to 32-bit (Super NES Mouse). So in addition to what I already display, I'd need to display 32 bits of data for up to seven lines. What would be a good way to go about that?<br /><br />(The U-Force is 48-bit, but I'll cross that bridge once it gets to me.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In that case I'd probably go with automatic page turning, or just slowly scroll the screen left or down until all data has been displayed, then let it wrap around to the first page again and do it all over again. It must be slow enough for one to be able to copy all bits to a paper, and the bits must probably be numbered. It's a bit annoying to read but if you have no way of input that's the only way I can think of.<br /><br />Also I don't really get why you bother with a large font like that for a tool like this. I always use a normal 8x8 font I stiched together from various fonts on this forum. I stole the capital letters from Super Mario Bros because it has nice and thick characters that are easy to read on any backdrop color on a CRT using RF even (besides the nostalgia factor of fonts like this), numbers from IBM PC BIOS since they not only goes well with SMB letters, but also have a zero that is easy to distinguish from the O. I based my lower case letters on the IBM PC font but I edited them so they became sans serif for maximum readability (although I usually leave the lower case out of NES programs since they take lots of CHR ROM space and aren't really needed for displaying information). I originally stole katakana from Family BASIC since it has separate dakuten and handakuten characters (as opposed to combining kana with the diacritcial marks as separate characters), but I have since created a new Japanese font based on another kana font, including separate dakuten/handakuten characters that I drew myself.
