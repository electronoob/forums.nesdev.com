		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I made a demo supposed to test SNROM board's additional WRAM enable bit.
<br />The demo abuses the WRAM enable/disable by setting a different state for each 4k CHR/ROM region, effectively allowing you to read back A12 through WRAM (if you read back the value you wrote in WRAM, then it is enabled and A12 is low, if you read open bus then the WRAM is disabled, and A12 is high).
<br />
<br />My demo is supposed to allow you to display a variable/height grayscale area on the screen (you can vary the height with the D-Pad). However, I have no SNROM devcart to test the demo on right now (if nobody has one I will make one), and the powerpak isn't an option currently as I'm pretty sure this disable bit isn't implemented.
<br />
<br />So could someone test the demo for me ? The .nes and sources are here : <a href="http://jonathan.microclub.ch/MMC1_a12/" class="postlink">http://jonathan.microclub.ch/MMC1_a12/</a>
<br />
<br />Note that currently the .nes frezes in all emus, because they kepp the WRAM enabled in all cases.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The revision shouldn't matter but it really matters that WRAM /CE is connected to MMC1's CHR A16.
<br />
<br />This is useful so that by reading WRAM, you can indirectly read /CE (if it's open but then the WRAM is disabled), which makes you indirectly read MMC1's CHR A16, which makes you indirectly read CHR-A12. The MMC1 internally uses A12 to selct which of the two latches, R1 and R2, is sent to CHR A12 - CHR A16 outputs, effectively creating two 4kb switchable banks. By writing $00 to R1 and $10 to R3, this creates a CHR A16 out = CHR A12 in.
<br />
<br />Reading A12 is "useful" because in this case, because BG uses left nametable, and sprites right nametables, it toggles exactly one time per frame, making it a scanline counter that doesn't depend on CPU speed (so it will work on both NTSC and PAL without any modifications). Not that useful I know, but it have never been done before.
<br />
<br />I know this is kind of complex and hard to understand, it's also hard for me to explain. I'm far from sure this will behave as I expect it on a SNROM board, so that's why it should be tested.

<br />
<br />I'd like to try it, but wlalink is crashing on me when I try to link it, no idea why. I need to link it for $E000, because that's all my MMC1 carts support. OK, apparently my download of one of the .lib files was corrupt (would be good to post a zip file of everything, simpler to download too). Would be nice if wla had told me the file was corrupt rather than crashing.
<br />
<br />Couldn't get your code working, it hung waiting for WRAM. I wrote my own code and found that it does detect A12 toggling as you planned, but that it detects it every scanline, regardless of where the sprites are. It also misses the A12 toggles every few frames on some resets, due I assume to CPU-PPU synchronization differences.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's because download software doesn't always recognize non-standard things like .nes and .lib as binary files. Actually, my browser recognizes them fine, but it's tedious to download each file individually, so I used a batch downloader that apparently didn't recognize correctly. That's two reasons for zipping archives of files rather than putting them up individually.
<br />
<br />As I wrote above, I got it assembling. I'm not sure whether this was meant to allow waiting until the middle of the screen with one wait loop, or waiting until the next scanline. It seems only possibly useful for the next scanline, but even then, it misses them depending on synchronization. I even tried doing four WRAM reads in a row when checking, to increase the chance of seeing the change. I was hoping this would work really well, since it's such a clever abuse of the disable line.

<br />That sucks. :/ I am going to put a 32-Pin socket on the board, and have a little protoboard wire up with socket pins so I can plug the boards in or a MASK ROM in the plain socket, minimizing the haxoring of the cart's board, so hopefully it won't die. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />The "gray bar" is shaking by a few scanlines though. This should be due to A12 randomly getting low while fetching sprites or something in the like.

<br />Also I unfortunately can only test this on my PAL NES : The socket + EPROM is too thick to fit into the toploader (without altering the system irreversibly).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, sorry, I realized last night that there's no way I could have run this on any of my devcarts, because I run the code out of... WRAM. Let's see, code in WRAM, WRAM getting disabled/enabled randomly by PPU. Can you say crash? Yeah, and I had even noticed this when trying to do the effect myself, and switched to running code out of internal RAM, but forgot that would have crashed your code too.
<br />
<br />Basically, this seems to suffer from the same kind of thing reading $2004 suffers from: synchronization affects whether CPU sees the magic value for a particular scanline, so it misses them sometimes. It's be great to work around this, because it's <em>such</em> a roundabout way of counting scanlines. CHR banking happens to also enable WRAM. Then you rely on open bus to detect whether it's enabled. And then count the number of times that occurs to count scanlines. Hahaha.

<br />I don't know. I guess that even when fetching sprites, A12 sometimes becomes low for a very short amount of time, and that's why they added a small lowpass filter on the line on MMC3 board. I tried to idenfity this behavior in my code by having two consecutive checks for WRAM being re-enabled (instead of just one) but apparently this fails. If both checks just happens during one of those short low impulses during sprite fetch, this will create a false positive, and the delay will be shorter than expected.
<br />
<br />EDIT : I should do another version with a gird on the BG so you can actually see how much scanlines is the gray area.

<br />Does anyone have more info about this ?
<br />I throught the dummy NT fetches were made before the actual NT/PT fetches, meaning that this will have the A12 line should constantly low.
<br />
<br />However, if they added a cap on MMC3 boards, there was a good reason for it.
