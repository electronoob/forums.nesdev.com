<br />Just to say this was just too much fun for me. Unfortunately capacities and shielded cables can't fix the problem.

<br />Now we gotta put up with more useless random IRC logs that don't make sense, and useless disinformation that serves the purpose of confusing newbies.
<br />
<br />And, the referenced page about lifetime bans seems to be specious reasoning at best.

<br />
<br />this is basically the off topic board. we can discuss whatever we want so long as we don't spam up the threads with promotional spots for completely unrelated garbage.
<br />
<br />Btw, SquigY0 is the station owner for the show i DeeJay.
<br />
<br />MISHAP is a project i am working on, and Memblers seems to see great promise in it, or at-least the TScript aspect of it as potentially becoming the fastest possible scripting engine ever to be released for an 8bit system at-least for a long standing period of at bare minimum the next 5 to 15 years, unless the project itself it forked and another individual or group of individuals works together in order to further soup up the TScript virtual machine optimized beyond what I have currently achieved for the 6502 CPU'd Commodore PET FAT-4016 Model "N".
<br />
<br />Like the NES, the FAT-4016 also has a maximum RAM ceiling of 3GB.
<br />
<br />Yes, 3GB is the max possible RAM for an 8bit system with a 6502 style CPU, I know this from what has already been achieved in the C-64/VIC-20/PET scene.
<br />
<br />I am actually in an unofficial race against my best friend, of whom is new to producing virtual machines. So far he keeps copying off my releases, without actually following the most pragmatic route.
<br />
<br />I have decided to stop idealizing my retro-gaming projects, and take the pragmatic route.
<br />
<br />Thus I dropped the RoE project in order to get back to work on porting Miser's House, and in the process resulting in the MISHAP : Miser's House Anthology Project, in order to create a universal engine between 8bit, 16bit, and 32bit systems in order to clone a vast array of text adventures within one virtual system.
<br />
<br />this is the following list of games in intend to include within the upcoming year:
<br />
<br />Miser's House
<br />Miser's Castle
<br />Miser's Island
<br />Zork I
<br />Zork II
<br />Zork III
<br />Farmer's Daughter
<br />ADVENT
<br />Dungeon of Death
<br />
<br />plus my own original game: Miser's Time Portal
<br />
<br />the last release was MISHAP1F (Build 0x1F) for MS-DOS.
<br />
<br />the current build i am working on is MISHAP 0x20, which is for win32 in order to be able to start working on hybrid NES Emu/Win32 API code.
<br />
<br />by 0x30 or 0x40 i plan to have the initial NES-compliant release.
<br />
<br />the site for MISHAP is <a href="http://mediaplague.com/miser/" class="postlink">http://mediaplague.com/miser/</a>
<br />
<br />Sure I am quirky as hell, but did you ever think to stop shoving burgers up your ass, and actually accept that some people just have their quirks?
<br />
<br />I have come to realize people don't always get along, and learned to simply accept it in stride, for if you listen to everyone, you are bound to learn something.
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />Timothy Robert Keal alias jargon

<br />20080816-185707 &lt;KEAL&gt; dude, unless you actually have something you yourself are working on, i don't give a fuck about your conspiracy theories if it isn't even related to something you are deeply involved in
<br />20080816-185757 &lt;KEAL&gt; and by in i mean dedicated to the intellectual progression of

<br />20080816-190328 &lt;DRA&gt; matter transportation is actually a manipulation of the threads of time, it's a way to leap across the space that separates 2 presents in existence at totally different locations
<br />20080816-190421 &lt;KEAL&gt; in my personal experience, one doesn't need a muthaflippin' transporter to synchronize ones conscious awareness with whatever parallel universe and/or point in the AKkadian record one desires
