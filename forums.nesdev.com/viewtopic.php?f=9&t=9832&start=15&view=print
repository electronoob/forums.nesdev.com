The FAMICOM has a 47 microfarads capacitor on the reset line if I am not mistaken.<br /><br />If the palette RAM is DRAM, it's made of capacitors (non polarized diodes to be more specific). If it's made as described on the quote it would be SRAM.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My front loading NES on powerup with a couple specific game carts (Golf for one) would result in a gray screen until I pressed the reset button. But other carts, like my PowerPAK, never had this issue. Could it be the caps in the cartridges that are meant to smooth out the power supply to the chips? Afterall they are very old by now.
