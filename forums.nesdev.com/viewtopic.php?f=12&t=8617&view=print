<br />If you have those two you'd have a pretty good way of dumping it.

<br />I won't get into the minefield of the ethics of dumping such a cart.

<br />
<br />I haven't delved too deeply into the hardware.
<br />Shouldn't be too complicated, though.
<br />IIRC, the original pcb had a microcontroller interfaced to the SNES via a dual-port RAM and there was some sort of rudimentary network port present aswell. (<a href="http://dforce3000.de/?p=filedump&amp;srch=campus" class="postlink">couple of pictures</a>)
<br />The above is a dump of the retrousb cartridge.
<br />I'm not sure if and to what extent the ROMs were patched in comparison to the original cartridge.
<br />
<br />I was also given a partial dump of the original Powerfest 94 ROMs for evaluation, which ran on similar hardware.
<br />However, I've promised not to share that one.

<br />The Retrode appears as just a standard FAT formatted disk to the computer, so the C code you would have to write is the AVR firmware.  All the A bus pins are connected so you could read/write anywhere.

<br />
<br />Oh? I thought Matthias said it couldn't write. In that case, dumping the S-DD1, SPC7110, and Cx4 (in MMX2, MMX3 can be dumped directly) should be trivial. And all we need is a proper SuperCIC integration to finally have a 100% compatible cartridge dumper. Awesome stuff!
