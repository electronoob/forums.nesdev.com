<br />
<br />So I decided to fix my PowerPak tonight. I've spent the last... hum... 4 hours doing this. Here are some pictures I took along the way:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.tokumaru.kit.net/ppfix1.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />I know, by far not the best soldering job in the world. I was so nervous about cutting traces because I was so afraid I'd ruin my PowerPak. At some point I thought "what was I thinking when I decided to do this?!?!"... In the end, my multimeter was saying everything was OK.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.tokumaru.kit.net/ppfix2.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />This is how I modified the back of the case. I used sandpaper instead of cutting a hole, because I thought it would look nicer / less ugly.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.tokumaru.kit.net/ppfix3.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />How the resistors look with everything assembled.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.tokumaru.kit.net/ppfix4.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />A bottom view of the modified case.
<br />
<br />Then, when I tried it on my NES I got really disappointed. I still had graphical glitches. Different glitches than before, but still glitches. I was then almost sure I had thrown (a lot of) money away, when I noticed that the new glitches were there because the cart wasn't inserted correctly.
<br />
<br />You see, the solder that's now present at the connector makes it impossible to insert that side fully, so you have to be somewhat careful to place the cart in correctly. After I did that, I got no more glitches. Everything looks fine now.
<br />
<br />I'm kinda happy, but I'm still a bit afraid that something might go wrong eventually... yeah, I can be really paranoiac sometimes!

<br />Your's looks more professionally done than mine.  I've had no problems with the PowerPak since the mod.  I wouldn't think you'll see any issues either.  Relax and enjoy it!

<br />I feel I have to comment on this, for the sake of the beginners out there.  Cutting traces can be <strong>very</strong> destructive to your board.  
<br />First, you could accidentally cut the wrong trace.  This is your own fault, but it happens.  This is normally fixable with some re-wiring.
<br />Second, on a multilayer board you can cut not only the traces on the surface - but ones on inner layers as well.  This usually cannot be fixed, as the nodes you need are buried inside the board.  This is especially likely in high volume production electronics in the consumer market.
<br />If you find yourself trying to cut traces for the first time, please find some old electronics to practice on (and check with a multimeter) before you attempt it on something valuable.

<br />
<br />yea, thats why i didnt even attempt it.  i make repros all the time, but never cut traces.  and if i messed it up, i would have been responsible and out 135 bucks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I cut board traces all the time. Just use a blade and keep going over the trace until it tests open with a meter. If you cut the wrong trace or need to re-bridge it later, just scratch the coating off on either side of the cut, then put a bit of solder and it will bridge across. Often you can cut the trace right next to a soldered wire, making it easier to re-bridge later. The point is that armed with a meter, blade, and solder, you can reliably diagnose and correct any damage you make.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been noticing a lot of the graphics glitches lately. I did the resistor fix with SMD resistors. The closest the local store had was 150 ohm so I used those. The SMD resistors are so small that the case fits perfectly without modification. All the graphics glitches are gone and the PowerPak works fine. If anybody wants I can post a picture. You have to cut a trace on the component side for connector 6.

I was trying to hold out till I felt it was nessesary to get the boot rom updated and then asking him to do the resistor fix all at once. However a few too many of the games I like seem to have a this problem, so im considering fixing it myself.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />First you carefully cut the traces from connector 7-13 under where the SMD resistors are now. I did it slightly away from the resistor IC so the solder won't flow over the cut in the trace when you solder in the SMD resistors. You have to tin the traces after you cut them before you solder the SMD resistors in. Try not to glop on the connector as I did. I used a small low power tip and soldered the resistors right to the globs on the IC resistor to make them more secure.
<br />
<br />Then solder the other end of the SMD resistor. Check with a multimeter. I would use 100-120 Ohm if you can get them. I only found 150 Ohm at my local store.
<br />
<br />Note the second picture. You have to cut connector trace #6 on the <span style="text-decoration: underline">component side</span>. You can figure out why if you follow the connections to that lead.
<br />
<br />I used a fine curved forceps to hold the resistors but a toothpick would probably be Ok.
