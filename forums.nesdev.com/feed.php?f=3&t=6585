OK everyone, we can stop flagging the Fantasy Zone profile now <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> It has been brought to my attention (thanks Zeromus) that this game actually programmed to work with both the Sunsoft-1 and Sunsoft-2 chips, so it is not wrong to have the game set to m93 (but it should also work as 184).<br /><br />I still stand by my conclusions and believe emulators should follow suggestions in my original post. While the game itself will run in either config, the board I happened to find it on (SUNSOFT-4) is not compatible with m93 logic. Possibly later runs of Fantasy Zone used Sunsoft-2 based boards.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=158">BootGod</a> — Tue Sep 27, 2011 5:58 pm</p><hr />

I meant to post this ages ago but I was just recently reminded about it.<br /><br />From what I recall, the current Sunsoft-1 &amp; 2 implementations are incorrect <br />and a bit of a mess. First of all, m89 and m93 are exactly the same board <br />with a different jumper config to select between CHR ROM or RAM. They could <br />easily share the same mapper number and be distinguished by the presence (or <br />lack of) CHR ROM. Changing mapper numbers is basically impossible, so <br />personally if I were writing an emulator, I'd just have 89 and 93 share the <br />same code so they would work either way.<br /><br />The fact that Fantasy Zone works as m93 is somewhat of a fluke I think, I remember <br />looking at some sources and saw they took some liberties that the cart does <br />not have. The 2 chips have a different register format, I don't remember how <br />emu's got around that, maybe they special cased it, I can't recall. Fantasy Zone most <br />definitely uses the Sunsoft-1 mapper,  except they wired it to bank <br />PRG ROM instead of CHR ROM. Again, this can be detected by presence of CHR <br />and both setups could use 184 as mapper.<br /><br />The only reason this stuff came to my attention was because I could not dump <br />Fantasy Zone as mapper 89/93 because its register is at $6000 not $8000 and <br />the format is different.<br /><br />Here is how they are supposed to work:<br /><br />Sunsoft-1 class / ines 184:<br />No bus-conflicts, hard-wired H/V mirroring, register at 6000h<br />register format:<br />   bits 0-2 select 4K VROM at PPU 0000h or if it uses VRAM, select 16K PRG <br />at 8000h<br />   bits 4-6 select 4K VROM at PPU 1000h or does nothing if using VRAM<br /><br />Sunsoft-2 class / ines 89 (and 93)<br />Has bus-conflicts, mapper-controlled 1-screen mirroring or hardwired H/V, <br />register at 8000h-FFFFh<br />register format:<br />   bits 0-2,7 select 8K VROM at PPU 0000h or do nothing if using VRAM**<br />   bit 3 selects NT0 or NT1 or does nothing if hard-wired mirroring<br />   bits 4-6 select 16K PRG at 8000h<br /><br />**Note: Don't remember if VRAM is only available as a specific "bank #" or <br />if it's available regardless of VROM bits , probably the latter.<br /><br />So what do you set the Fantasy Zone mapper too? m93 makes it work in current emulators, <br />but technically its wrong. Setting it to 184 makes it not work in current <br />emulators because they weren't aware of the issue. Perhaps m93 can be rigged <br />as a catch-all, where an emulator can properly implement 89 and 184 and have <br />93 a hack that works for whatever.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=158">BootGod</a> — Sat Jul 10, 2010 5:39 pm</p><hr />
