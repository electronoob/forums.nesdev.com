I've had a <a href="http://stoneagegamer.com/fc16goportablesnes.aspx" class="postlink">FC-16 Go</a> for almost a year now.  The Supaboy has some advantages compared to the FC-16 Go:
<br />
<br /><ul>1. The Supaboy has two SNES controller ports, so you can hook up real SNES peripherials.<br /><br />2. The Supaboy is compatible with games like Super Mario RPG.<br /><br />3. The D-pad and buttons have a better feel on the Supaboy.  Button placement is a bit better.  The FC-16 Go places the reset button right between the start and select buttons, which can lead to accidental resets.<br /></ul>
<br />
<br />I've only had the Supaboy for a few hours, so I've only tested a few games.  Super Mario RPG (which works on my Supaboy but does not work on my FC-16) and several games including Super Mario Kart (running off of a SNES PowerPak flash cart).

I tested the games using my SNES PowerPak, since most of my SNES carts are in storage.  Faceball 2000 is not playable on the FC-16 Go, but it plays perfectly on my Supaboy.  Any idea as to why the FC-16 Go is incompatible?  Faceball 2000 loads on the FC-16 Go, the initial credits screen displays, you can select 1 or 2 players, but it only shows a black screen when loading into a level.

<br />
<br />An emulator that uses the actual cartridge does not need special chip or mapper support. That's handled by the cartridge. All it needs to do is properly interact with the cartridge pins. The other one probably had poor handling of the extra pins on certain special chip carts.

<br />
<br />Eh, same end result. An attempt to duplicate the original hardware, inherent with many, many flaws as a result. Maybe you cut down on the latency a tiny bit, or maybe not, but that's about the only advantage.

One advantage is that you get a better accuracy/power ratio than any software emulator today can offer. One disadvantage is that it's hideous and clunky compared to a mainstream handheld running a software emulator.

<br />Possibly because they're manufactured on different processes with different microns. That might change the timing just enough that the cartridge might not respond correctly, especially if a coprocessor wants more current. But then I know nothing about IC die-shrinks.

<br />
<br />As kyuusaku said, these are real "clones" not emulators. The NES clones are pretty accurate but various problems lead many to believe they are quite poor. Primarily the duty cycle's being swapped and the incorrect cartridge port wiring that leads to the belief that they don't work with MMC5 which they probably would if the cartridge port was wired properly. And audio and video quality of output could be related to the circuits the builders of particular clones used and not a fault in the chip cloning.
<br />
<br />I've heard some SNES clones do infact work with SA-1 games. But I cannot provide any proof myself since I have no SNES clone and have no reason to buy one. But on Youtube I recall seeing a video showing someone running SM RPG on some clone.

<br />
<br />What is the advantage of using an actual cart? It's kind of a chore to drag around my complete US game collection with me when I'm on the go.
<br />Not to mention just finding the cart I want to play. And then there's the size of each cart adding to what you have to hold while playing.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i221/byuusan/DSC00833.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />All of that can fit on a microSD card the size of my pinky nail. The ROM data is pretty much the only thing we can truly say we have bit-perfect copies of.
<br />
<br />&gt; People may say clones are bad or whatever but unless you cite a specific example of a problem that can be verified then it's all just unverifiable talk. 
<br />
<br />Going from what I've heard about many of these in the past. But yeah sorry, I'm not spending $80 on this to prove a point. So if you want to ignore what I'm saying, by all means, be my guest. It's your money.
