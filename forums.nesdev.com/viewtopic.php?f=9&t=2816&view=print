<br />It does actually. The version of <em>The Goonies (J) [hM03]</em> I have does prevent bus conflicts.

<br />
<br />all i did was split the .nes file with cajones and then programmed the eproms.  im not that knowledgeable on all of the nuts and bolts of rom files.  do you set the mirroring when you split the file manually?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Bus conflicts will only made your ROM chip and CPU suffer a bit during a few microseconds because they'll try to output different values. This won't damage them, but gets unpredictable bankswitching. However, this DON'T corrupt the tiles (you may just get the wrong tileset), and if you burned the Goonies hacked to use mapper 3 (CNROM), for some reason the hacker DID prevent bus conflicts, so you won't have them normally. The original Goonies have no bus conflicts anyway, since the mapper is located at $6000 so no ROM data is here.
<br />I think you should remove all solder on 'V' pad first (and make sure there is no contact), and then put some solder on 'H' pad to set Goonies the vertical mirroring it is relying on.

<br />
<br />The MMC mappers control mirroring through software, so it doesn't matter.  Does sound like a dirty connector though (or maybe bad CHR wiring).

<br />
<br />That looks more like a corrupted data line on your CHR.  Maybe you got a floater... that is, a signal that is disconnected and floating, getting a bit of capacitive coupling.
