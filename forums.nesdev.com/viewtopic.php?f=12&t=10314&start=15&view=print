The capacitor works like a tiny rechargeable battery, if it has more that 3V, then it must be still charged up from the SNES power supply.<br /><br />In that situation the SRAM works even without the battery, which is fine... unless you want to test if the battery is working, then it's rather disturbing (you won't see battery problems until the capacitor discharges, which may take some minutes.. or days... whatever).<br /><br />To get rid of that effect: Remove the CB capacitor (desolder it, it's rather useless anyways). Or shortcut the two CB pins with each other, that should discharge the capacitor after less than a second (for example: bridge the two CB contacts with a screwdriver, that should be totally harmless on that PCB) (assuming that the SNES power-supply is switched off, else you might see some smoke &amp; sparks).<br /><br />And be sure to count the chips after each test... just in case that some of should happen to disappear (no, not seriously).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Removing the cap will make the cart more susceptible to power fluctuations, its purpose is to &quot;recharge&quot; when you power on the console, and any time the power fluctuates, it helps smooth out the transients.  It would be easier to just short the two leads together (TEMPORARILY, just touch the leads with a wire or something then remove it, and with the power DISCONNECTED) in order to fully discharge it when you test.  What you're seeing with the 4v on the SRAM chip is that the console is charging the capacitor up to 5v, and it's slowly dropping after the console is turned off, acting as a very small battery.  This may be why the saves are being retained for short periods of time.  Removing the capacitor, or shorting the leads, removes this factor from your debugging, so you can actually see what the battery is doing on its own.

Shorting it out is only useful for testing whether the battery works.</div><br />Yeah, forgot to mention this... sorry.  When you short the capacitor, you're also shorting the entire supply rail to ground, which would have essentially the same result as removing the battery, as far as the SRAM is concerned.  The point of shorting the capacitor would be to do it, then test the voltage on the various Vcc pins, the battery terminals, etc. to see whether or not you still had a reasonable supply voltage (3.4ish volts). If you short the capacitor and then read much lower voltages than you did before, then you know it was the capacitor maintaining the voltage before.  If you want to test data retention, you'll want to remove the capacitor (just the big electrolytic one, the smaller ones shouldn't hold enough charge to matter).  If the battery is dead, then with the capacitor gone, the saves should be lost almost instantly when you power down.  Otherwise, if the saves are still retained for several days, then the issue probably lies elsewhere, like maybe a bad trace or solder joint.

Replacing the capacitor won't fix the save problem (unless it's due to supply transients during power-on/off... but that's rather unlikely), it's the battery that is responsible for maintaining power to the SRAM, not the capacitor.  The only reason it was suggested to remove it was because the capacitor might be masking a problem with the battery.

There is a major color difference between the top and bottom of each of the contact pads. I still stand behind just cleaning it with isopropyl alcohol, but finding a pencil eraser takes almost no effort.<br /><br />The pencil eraser will clean by purely a friction action (don't go overboard and rip up the traces), whereas alcohol will dissolve most of the crud, and then the remainder removed by friction/exposure from the cotton swab.<br /><br />If you have a bad contact to one of the middle Address lines (A11-ish) on powerup, but the game code can get far enough to where it checks the SRAM, then it might think the save data integrity is bad and then attempt to initialize it.
