		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello,
<br />
<br />I've been reading this forum all night, all hot-and-bothered to figure out how to stuff a FF3j rom onto a cart, and in trying to figure out a better way to do this than cutting up a rare variant of SMB2 I found that Nintendo made the TKEPROM, back in the day.
<br />
<br />!!!
<br />
<br />Way cool, and useful for probably every MMC3 based game.
<br />
<br />Obviously, you guys already knew this, but what I lack in NES development knowledge I make up for in electrical engineering. If I can get really good photos of both sides of a preferably unpopulated NES-TKEPROM-02, I can work up the design and have it fabbed - it's looking like a run of 100 would cost $4 apiece, so I'm thinking there's probably enough people here interested to make it a worthwhile venture. 20 people at $10 per would cover half the costs, I think that'd make it worth my while to float the rest.
<br />
<br />Obviously, it would still need a transplant MMC3 (possibly also that Nintendo-marked DIP between the PRG ROMS as well, if there's no ready substitute), BUT, there are a LOT of MMC3 games out there, and it's only a QFP-44, so not terribly hard to rework. 
<br />
<br />The upshot of this is that since the board would be a duplicate of something that is known to work, there would be no real development time other than the CAD work, which would be a weekend or two (or three). 
<br />
<br />So, any interest, advice, etc?

<br />Few people complain about the limited supply of Super NES CICs desoldered from the limited but still large quantity of D-rarity annual sport games to put in SNES PowerPak. But I agree with you that an MMC3 or useful subset thereof would be the best solution. I wish I knew Verilog.

<br />
<br />More interesting would be to find a source for the MMC3 clones used by the Chinese pirates/companies and make a board built around those.

If the mapper itself still has to be lifted from an official board (which I imagine is not easy, because of the tiny legs), I see no reason for a new board, I can just use the one where the chip is.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I actually have a bunch of MMC3 clones that I bought last year from a supplier in China (DIP-40 packaging).  It's embarrassing to admit since I knew I was taking a gamble on them (just more NESdev experimenting fun), but as it turns out very few of them actually work.  I believe it was 2 out of 10 tested that work.. some of them were partial, one worked except for the IRQ, for example..).  And these are brand new chips (well, NOS).  I have a bunch more that are untested.. but with that defect rate it's too much trouble for me to want to make a board at this point.
<br />
<br />This chip would be good for a project like this, if you're interested enough I could contact them again and see if they <em>really</em> want to get rid of those chips.  I'm sure I don't have 100 working ones, but I'd be happy to see any of them go to use.  It's not hard to test them, it's just time consuming without a ZIF socket.
<br />
<br />A lot of working MMC3 carts get the axe to become repros.  I try to buy surplus NES carts every now and then (SMB/DH mostly), but often I've been told there are no MMC3 ones because they've all been bought up for that purpose.  It's cool on a smaller scale but there is a point where it's a lame thing to do.  People have and will make donors out of Kirby's Adventure, basically anything available that fits.
