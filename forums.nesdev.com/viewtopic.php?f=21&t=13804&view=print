I guess that's what happens, when you don't have choice over the colors in the palettes.<br /><br />By the way, thanks, tokumaru for sharing this technique. I was wondering how you can do this sort of thing without editing individual tiles, even though it's not very recommended to use this, when making NES-style images.

Their decision of not using any dithering at all also makes things way worse.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">By the way, thanks, tokumaru for sharing this technique.

The PPU sucks for straightforward display of photographic images anyway, so I can't help feeling like trying to improve this kind of conversion is a waste of time.

Converting the graphics into a .chr file, making nametables and palette data, and putting all of that in an engine, that would display it all will take too much time and is pointless.<br />Also, while sprites could help, you'd have to know where to put them, keeping to the 8 sprites per scanline limitation. And besides, I wouldn't try adding sprites to a picture, that's meant to show what the NES's background graphics could do.<br /><br />I guess I could make a new version of the NES image, where I'd select which tiles to use which palettes and maybe also select the colors. That will make it look much better.<br /><br />By the way, how would you go about uploading this to Wikipedia? Do you just edit the article or is permission from the original author required.

That's probably why dithering, raster effects, overlays, or any other kind of graphical tricks are not used in any of the images.
