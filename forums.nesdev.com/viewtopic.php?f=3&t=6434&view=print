<br />
<br />After successfully implementing the hardware for a few mappers I thought it would be cool to implement the hardware for the game genie so that i could use some game genie codes with my emu!!  Anyone know where I can find some good docs on how the GG codes and the hardware works?
<br />
<br />I have no idea how this thing works except that it redirects addresses from the CPU or something like that.
<br />
<br />I'd really appreciate any info you guys have!
<br />
<br />THANKS!

The Genie intercepts reads from $8000-$FFFF. It can intercept up to three addresses, and either unconditionally cause a new value to be read back, or do that only if the byte that would have been read back matches some compare value. The compare feature is basically a cheap way to make it work with bank switching, without it having to know exactly how it works, though it wouldn't work if a game happened to have the same byte at that address in different banks that get selected, and you wanted to patch in only one bank.
<br />
<br />Original code writes 0 to $FFF0, $FFF1, $FFF0. Not sure whether this causes the GG to do anything. Original code then writes registers in reverse order. GG fills unused codes with $FF. $8000 should be written last, with low bit set, then written with zero.
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">$8000&nbsp; &nbsp;-DDDCCCG&nbsp; &nbsp; Disables, Compare enables, Genie enable<br /><br />$8001&nbsp; &nbsp;0HHHHHHH&nbsp; &nbsp; High bits of address &#40;bit 15 assumed 1&#41;<br />$8002&nbsp; &nbsp;LLLLLLLL&nbsp; &nbsp; Low bits of address<br />$8003&nbsp; &nbsp;CCCCCCCC&nbsp; &nbsp; Compare value &#40;0 if unused&#41;<br />$8004&nbsp; &nbsp;RRRRRRRR&nbsp; &nbsp; Replacement value<br /><br />$8005-$8008 Second code, same as above<br /><br />$8009-$800C Third code, same as above</div>
<br />
<br />I believe the disables and enables have the lowest bit corresdponding to the first code, highest bit the last.
<br />
<br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> corrected $FF00 to $FFF0.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Awesome Blargg!!! Thanks!! I'm actually very surprised how hard it is to find reverse engineering info on the GG.  I thought for sure I would find a slew of info on the Wiki or on the NesDev front page.
<br />
<br />Ideally I'd like to actually be able to run the GG software and have it control a my replication of the game genie hardware (to have it be the most authentic). I'm surprised no one has RE'd the hardware....but I guess once you know how the codes work why would you need to RE the original hardware that the software ran on.  Lol.
<br />
<br />If anyone has more notes/docs let me know! I might be able to get by with what I have now but I haven't read everything to know yet. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello all!  I just wanted to post an update on my emu regarding this.  I just finished implementing the hardware for the original game genie in Verilog HDL for my emu.  Works like a champ!  It runs the original Game Genie ROM and can have an arbitrary number of codes and it has the ability to enable/disable codes during gameplay.  Thanks a lot to Blargg for providing the RE'ing knowledge.
<br />
<br />Just one minor correction to Blargg's original RE'ing info.  he stated that the first address written to by the genie is $FF00.  But it is in fact, $FFF0.  So the full sequence is $FFF0, $FFF1, $FFF0.
<br />
<br />Now I can finally play some of these ridiculously hard games for more than a minute. lol. This will be a great help when I'm play testing.
<br />
<br />I also found more/duplicate info on the genie in this post:
