		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Strange question I didn't easily find an answer for but perhaps someone here might know something about it. EPROMs can be erased by a UV eraser device and reprogrammed which means there are plenty of used EPROMs around. But is there any particular limit to the amount of times you can program and erase an EPROM? Flash type memories will tell you the amount of reprogramming cycles it is rated for but I've never seen any such thing for EPROMs. Assuming you erase and program them properly do EPROMs essentially go on forever? I was thinking perhaps someone here may erase their own EPROMs and reuse them and might be able to say they have used the same EPROM over and over X amount of times.

<br />
<br />Avoid EPROMs in this day and age, go with flash.  :-)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Nothing in the Microchip or National datasheets mentions anything about a maximum number of erase or write cycles, but googling for "eprom wear -eeprom" provides a link where a guy says:<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">During programming the floating gate in the EPROM cell is subjected to a strong electrical field.  The process is too complex (or I am just to lazy and have a bad memory) to detail here.  However during use charges will get trapped in the floating gate or the insulating oxide. It is these trapped charges that usually cause EPROM failure and are the reason for finite life cycles for them.<br /><br />Programming the EPROM for longer than is necessary or programming at a voltage that is too high will accelerate an EPROMs demise.  This is just what the generic fast programming method does. [...] I have never had an EPROM wear out before I plugged it in back to front, gave it 15V VCC, or accidentally thought it was mains powered). </div>So the answer appears to be "Yes, they wear out, but you'll be much more tired of putting the EPROMs under the UV lamp for 15 minutes at a time before it happens. (Another random link says "2 million cycles")
<br />
<br />As an additional anecdote: I took a lab class in college where we were still reusing 27c256s that were manufactured twenty years earlier, and in the course of the class the students would probably go through a couple hundred erase/write cycles.

<br />Same thing for flash eprom too. I already broke one leg by using it too much. Maybe I was not careful enough thought.

<br />
<br />But the point is you can use them nearly forever. I have eproms that have been in use of erasing and reprogramming, rinse and repeat sense 1985.
