		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah, well I had taken the source of an emulator, studied it, and tried to manipulate it to see how it effects the "NES", and it is going  find and dandy, but there is something I don't think I will quite understand too well by doing that:  How to read the NES CHR graphics format.  The source I was looking at reads it in a very funky and unfriendly way, and I have been resorted to modifying a CHR file, saving it, then opening it in a hex editor to see how it works.  It's not going very well, and I've been searching the high hills to and from with little success.
<br />
<br />I know that the graphics are stored on 2 bit planes (2BPP), so  I "think" that means... well I can't be too sure of that, because the documentation out there on the internet seems to be limited with examples of reading bit planes and how they are written.
<br />
<br />Lastly, you may be asking yourself this:  "Why does he need to know how CHR data is stored?  You already have X CHR editors out there!"  Well that is a simple thing to answer, and the answer to that is I want to make my own 2BPP tile editor for NES ROMS, AND I want to do that because if I write a CHR editor, and it actually stores data properly, I will know if the tile decoder I am using for my emulator is working correctly.  How else would you be able to check how accurate your tile decoder is?  Hmm???  Thats what I thought!
<br />
<br />lol, I added more to this than I had to, but at least I think you know why I am asking now, so hopefully someone can help explain to me the layout of 2BPP CHR files, so that I can build my own CHR editor!
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Thanks!

<br />A little aggressive there, aren't we?
<br />
<br />Anyway, everything you need is in the link above, there is nothing else we can say. If that is not clear enough and you have specific questions, just ask.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />lol, sorry if I sounded a tad bit aggressive.  I guess I was going a little overboard for my meaningless assumption of...whatever I was anticipating.  Anywho, I NEVER looked in the wiki for the graphics layout --- how dumb of me!
<br />
<br />I just looked at the diagram, and...I understand it.  It is amazingly simple how it works.  I see it now:
<br />
<br />bytes 0-7 control color bits 0, storing them in plane 0
<br />
<br />bytes 7-15 control color bits 1, storing them in plane 1
<br />
<br />That link just saved me from premature balding, so thank you very much.  I'll may ask a couple other questions shall they arise, but I think I got it.
