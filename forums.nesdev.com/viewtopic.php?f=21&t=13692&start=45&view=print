I like the design, but it extends out two pixels into a new tile, so it would require some extra tiles.<br /><br /><img src="http://eightballgaming.com/img/Sample005.png" alt="Image" />

But they only use two shades when everything else uses three, and there doesn't seem to be anything else tying up that extra palette entry anymore.<br /><br />Then again, I'm no artist. Just because it's techically feasible doesn't make it a good idea.

This is still just an early experiment, or a mock-up, and I don't know conclusively what I am going to want in each level.  So if I need a level that is a forest with a cabin in it, I don't have to scrap out all of my forest tiles to fit in the cabin.  Or a forest with a stream, or whatever.  The point is, I have room to add more detail once I know exactly what I want.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's not what I meant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're using one palette for the ground, one for the grass, leaves and silhouettes, and one for the tree trunks, yes? Only two colors are being used from the tree trunk palette. You could add a third shade like you did with the other two.<br /><br />EDIT: my bad, I thought the highlights on the leaves were the same shade as the silhouettes in the background. Pay my poor eyesight no mind.

Using CHR-ROM I can easily swap out tiles for new animation frames, so I have some extra space for extra frames.<br /><br />I'm not very experienced with pixel animation, so I'm not opposed to a more trained eye pointing out anything I have done wrong.<br /><br />dougeff:  It's one of many games I was using as inspiration for that tileset.

I guess we just don't explain it and hope nobody asks. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Also, I'd make his knees kick up a little higher for a run.

I got a couple ideas, but the dark theme I was exploring lends itself to having less.<br /><br />And having finished this up, I need to make up my mind if I'm actually going to pursue this project.  I'm leaning toward yes, but I have more to consider than just how good I can make the art.  Nevertheless, I would appreciate some candidness in your comments.  Please, be honest.
