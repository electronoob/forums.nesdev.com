I think schematics of the other revisions is much less useful since there is far less &quot;resolution&quot; into what is going on due to the merged components.  But more (nintendo) power to whoever feels up to it! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Thanks again!<br /><br />--<br /><br />On a side note, does anyone know where I could buy a (working) revision 2 console? It's incredibly difficult to find one since the rev2 and rev3 look exactly alike from the outside. I've emailed people selling them on eBay and asked if they could look inside for me but this is problematic for two reasons:<br /><br />1) 99% of people don't have the required game bit to open the console<br />2) It's rather difficult to explain to them what I'm looking for on the PCB for people who are not engineering types.<br /><br />I've also purchased a couple SNES'  from local retro gaming stores and they were both rev3. And they don't want to let you open the console to look inside. Which is stupid because all I do is buy it, take it home, open it, and return it. Haha. Kind of a pain.<br /><br />Am I absolutely correct that there is no way whatsoever to tell between rev2 and rev3 from the outside?  Is there a way to tell by looking at the serial number??

So if you look at the 2nd/3rd revision console in this image I posted: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/console_types/side_by_side_bot.jpg" class="postlink">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/console_types/side_by_side_bot.jpg</a><br />Which revision would that be? A couple differences from what you describe are that the serial starts with UN instead of SN and the serial number also has 8 digits rather than the 7 digits you have shown (SN30xxxxx). Assuming you meant 8 digits and not 7, and assuming that the UN/SN designator doesn't matter then I would classify the console shown in the image as revision 2. Is that correct?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">qwertymodo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do you need the whole console/shell/etc, or just the PCB?</div><br />I really only _need_ the PCB, but I'd _want_ to have the whole thing. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

I can't believe how much I've learned about the SNES architecture just by doing this alone. Pretty awesome. Here is a 1000ft view: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/schematics/snes_schematic_progress2.png" class="postlink">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/schematics/snes_schematic_progress2.png</a><br /><br />Now I just gotta add all the traces, resistors, caps, etc... I think the most time consuming part is out of the way.

But the CPUN-A (160pin chip with CPU and PPU1 and PPU2 in one chip) pinouts would be interesting. Currently there's no info for people who want to do modding on the mainboard. If somebody would want to trace them out: go ahead!

Render at high res, render at low res, it's still the same file, and it'll still look sharp as long as your coordinates are aligned to the grid.
