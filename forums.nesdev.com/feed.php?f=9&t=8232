Ah okay. So wherever that via leads to, it's tied to Vcc by the solder blob (instead of being connected to the console audio in line). The audio in line still leads <em>somewhere</em> though. Hmm...<br /><br />Another thing about the Supermax cart board... cart pin 57 (normally CHR D7 but ROM D15 for one-bus systems) isn't connected to anything. Strange. And also, notice there is a pair of solder pads which would allow pins 48 &amp; 49 to be connected (as they are in most Famicom carts).<br /><br />Edit: Looking at the MiWi cart board pics I posted, there are two pairs of solder pads labelled A0 and VD7. The VD7 pads are connected on the PCB. But if the other pair were connected instead, A0 instead of VD7 would be routed to wherever the PCB trace leads. The Supermax cart boards might be hard-wired to have A0 connecting to the equivalent place, since their VD7 pin is not connected to anything.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=316">mark_k</a> — Tue Oct 25, 2011 11:10 am</p><hr />

I have uploaded some pics of my Power Joy Supermax cartridges <a href="http://imgur.com/a/QxmzO" class="postlink">here</a>. The PCBs of my carts and your one seem almost identical (same XD AB2187R1.2 text), but they are not.<br /><br />On your cartridge, follow the trace from pin 46 of the cart connector. (On a normal Famicom cart with no sound hardware, pin 46 is connected to pin 45.) It looks like the trace ends at a pair of solder pads which, if they were bridged, would tie the audio in line to Vcc. (It's not clear from the pic whether or not the solder pads -- if that's what they are -- are bridged or not. Also note the solder blob on your board which connects a via to the adjacent Vcc line.)<br /><br />With my cart board, pin 46 is not obviously tied to Vcc, but the trace goes to two vias in the PCB, so I'd need to use a multimeter to find exactly where it connects to.<br /><br />So it looks like some one-bus Famicom clones must change their behaviour somehow when the audio in line is tied to Vcc.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=316">mark_k</a> — Tue Oct 25, 2011 8:47 am</p><hr />

Ah, a Power Joy Supermax cartridge! :) I have two of those, but I'm not sure exactly where I put them. Your cart is the one-bus type, so there's no way it will ever work on a real Famicom or NES.<br /><br />Are you able to upload higher-res pics of the board? It looks like that cart is doing something with the audio in line (pin 46, audio from cart to console's audio output).<br /><br />socram8888: Thanks. So the NEX operates either in normal 8-bit NES/FC-compatible mode, or in one-bus mode with 16-bit ROM.<br /><br />Another console which seems to use one-bus-like cartridges is the MiWi. That's a "16-bit" console, so probably not directly compatible with normal Famicom carts. But if you look at the cart board pictures, you'll notice their layout is <strong>very</strong> similar to the pic that socram8888 uploaded. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/H5z0M" class="postlink">Pics here</a>. So if we somehow get the capability to easily dump one-bus cartridges, carts for consoles like the MiWi should be dumpable the same way.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=316">mark_k</a> — Tue Oct 25, 2011 5:59 am</p><hr />

Okay, well from looking at the <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=85525" class="postlink">Messiah Generation NEX schematic</a> it's fairly clear how that console operates.<br /><br />I still need to open up my one-bus-compatible Arcade Action II console to check whether it's wired similarly to the NEX. (My console is branded Arcade Action II on top, the label underneath says it's an Argo UT-60. Note that earlier UT-60 consoles are not one-bus-compatible, so they probably use a different NOAC.)<br /><br />Most NES <em>cartridge</em> boards connect pins 57 (CIRAM /CE) and 58 (CHR /A13) of the cart connector. Similarly most Famicom carts connect pins 48 and 49. (Games which use 4-screen mirroring or MMC5 <em>don't</em> just connect those pins together, which explains why the clone consoles fail with those games.)<br /><br />The NEX schematic shows pin 57 of the cart connector is grounded, and pin 58 connects to the NOAC ONEBUS pin (as well as the audio output circuitry, meaning that the VT03's second APU is only enabled in one-bus mode).<br /><br />The result is that with most cartridges, because they connect pins 57 and 58, the ONEBUS pin is grounded, disabling one-bus mode when a cart is inserted. (A little note: the NEX schematic has transposed the pin numbers for the NES connector. So what are in reality pins 57 and 58 are shown as pins 21 and 22 on the schematic.)<br /><br />Looking at both my AT-103 cart board and the board that socram8888 posted, pins 57 and 58 are unconnected. So consoles designed similarly to the NEX will operate in one-bus mode with those cartridges. And if connected to a real Famicom or NES, apart from the one-bus issue, the console's VRAM is disabled.<br /><br />Again from the NEX schematic, it looks like the XD16BUSB pin of the VT03 is left open. Assuming the schematic reflects the layout of actual NEX consoles, that means 16-bit ROM mode is always disabled with the NEX. So it may be that the NEX would not be compatible with my one-bus cartridge. (I'm not certain though; it may be that the AT-103 cart PCB can be configured to work in 16-bit-ROM mode, but my cartridge isn't set up/jumpered for that.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=316">mark_k</a> — Mon Oct 24, 2011 10:56 am</p><hr />

If my interpretation of the jumper pads on your board is correct:<br />ROM pin 31 can be connected to A0 or VD7 (= D15)???

Looks like a trace connects it to VA3.<br /><br />The other jumpers would be used differently depending on the ROM capacity. Since A24 is tied to Vcc on your board, your ROM capacity is probably 16Mbytes. Also, it might be possible for the manufacturer to make one large-capacity ROM, and produce multiple different cartridges using it by setting jumper options differently.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=316">mark_k</a> — Sun Oct 23, 2011 8:54 am</p><hr />

Maybe it was used on a different version or cart<br /></div><br /><br />I guess your cart PCB was designed to accept either TSOP flash or chip-on-board ROM. Probably the solder pads need to be bridged differently depending on the type of chip used.<br /><br />Looking at your pinout, CHR data lines 0-2 and 4-7 correspond to ROM data bus lines D8-D10 and D12-D15. That matches the info in the VT02 datasheet for 16-bit ROM mode. However, in your pinout pin 50 (normally CHR A7) is connected to D11 of the ROM. I would have expected cartridge connector pin 29 (normally CHR D3) to be connected to ROM D11.<br /><br />Do the silk-screened names on your cart board correspond to the normal cart pinout? VA3, VA4, VA7, VA8, VA9 could refer to CHR address lines, and VD7 to CHR data line 7. The pairs of solder pads marked JA and JB could maybe be set differently if the ROM is to be used in 8-bit mode???<br /><br />Thinking about it some more, the silk-screening on your board probably means this. The numbers refer to pin numbers of the ROM (not the TSOP). So for example, pin 33 of the ROM can be connected to VA9, GND or Vcc depending on which pair of solder pads is bridged. And ROM pin 1 can be connected to either Vcc or VA7 depending on which pair of pads are bridged.<br /><br />Another thing to be figured out is how the console determines whether 16-bit ROM mode is used.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=316">mark_k</a> — Sun Oct 23, 2011 2:56 am</p><hr />

Maybe it was used on a different version or cart<br /><br />Read the VT02 datasheet, and you'll see that this is NOT an UNROM, but a totally different system<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4431">socram8888</a> — Sun Oct 23, 2011 1:44 am</p><hr />

But does that really even tell you anything?  The standard TSOP flash isn't even used...  Everything is on the glob top up front.<br /><br />If you're looking to track down the pinouts I would recommend using a multimeter so you can follow traces out of view.  Also you might get a few hints from the FC pinout since they appear to be following some patterns there.<br /><br />What is this compared to the other pictures you linked to before because there are different pictures.   Similar but different game/cart I'm guessing?  The original pictures you posted didn't even have a pad layout for a TSOP flash.<br /><br />I'm still curious what it is that makes you say that clone allows both CHR and PRG data to be contained on the same ROM.  (and not in a UNROM fashion)  I still haven't seen any proof of this, but I haven't read any data sheets or anything mind you, I'm only going off your pictures.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Sat Oct 22, 2011 4:53 pm</p><hr />
