<br />
<br />So I'm starting a page that will (for now) host my NSF/GBS collection.
<br />You can find the template here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://snesmusic.org/hoot/gbs">http://snesmusic.org/hoot/gbs</a><!-- m -->
<br />Tell me what you think about it (the NSF one will have additional sound chip field), should I change or add something?

<br />Major site rehaul, separated game and other rips, indicated if rip is nonGBS format (for the few GBR/GB/MGB files), updated the GBS archive located here:

Key requirement is that anyone can submit soundtracks <em>without</em> having a central moderator to slow things down with lazyness. Multiple rips are fine; you just decide which ripper you trust most.
<br />
<br />Hell, considering the current state, even one of those group discussion lists with a shared file repository would work (like yahoo groups). It's a mess right now.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I read your other thread, and I have a couple of suggestions.
<br />
<br />First, you might look at the <a href="http://hvsc.c64.org" class="postlink">High Voltage SID Collection</a>. In my opinion, this is the type of archive that we should shoot for - it contains game music, covers, originals, and is basically an attempt at containing <strong>all</strong> C64 songs in one archive. Plus, the HVSC includes the SID Tune Information List (or STIL), which holds information about individual tunes (for example, if a song is a cover of an existing song, STIL is the place to find that out - also, STIL holds comments made about the tunes by their authors). Whether it's done in an automated fashion or not, it doesn't matter. Updates are also handled quite well in the HVSC, and it's possible that the HVSC Update program could be adapted to work with NSF or GBS files.
<br />
<br />Perhaps the concept of the HVSC could be combined with your automated solution - for instance, when the site reaches a substantial number of proper rips, then you could put out a release containing all of the tunes. Every so often, you could make a new "all-of-them" release that people can download if they're new to NSF/GBS, and also an update pack that adds all of the new rips. I definitely think there should be an element of manual control over these pack releases, as there needs to be a bit of quality control. This way, the hardcore NSF/GBS people can download the individual rips as they're uploaded, and more casual fans can download the packs and have clean, proper rips with supplemental information that gives added value to the collection.

<br />Unless you, say, make a cover and wrap some trivial game (tetris clone, snake clone, pong clone, etc) around it. Then what's the difference between video game music and "covers and original stuff"?

That wouldn't work well here, as 70% of the files don't have composer credit, and there aren't that much rips, so normal a-z directories should work well.<br /><br />I've been also thinking about the 26 character filename limits.<br />Currently the files are named like this:<br />Lufia - The Legend Returns (2001)(Natsume)(rip Kingshriek).gbs<br />(rip field only when there are repeated files to differentiate between them). That does exceed 26 chars by a lot.

Not exactly active, are they? The MCK 2chn thread alone has released about 600 new NSF files since then.<br />But yeah, I've talked about this earlier, and I will concentrate rather on the game part. Unless someone at 2a03.org would like to join force.<br />Other formats are pretty much game only. Well, there are some demo/pd GBS, but they are made by Manfred Linzer (Shin'en demos) and Jake Kaufman (Drymouth), who both made game music on Gameboy.

All mine does is start off at a different place, so that the first track in the rip is the first track in-game (the other tracks aren't in order). Since Caitsith2 ripped it before I did, and mine doesn't add anything significant, I'd just leave his rip up instead of both.
<br />
<br />I have a GBR rip of Wizardry Gaiden 1 - Suffering of the Queen. I have no idea where I got from, but here it is: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://h1.ripway.com/kingshriek/WizardryGaiden1-SufferingoftheQueen.zip">http://h1.ripway.com/kingshriek/Wizardr ... eQueen.zip</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />I get the feeling there's a large amount of GBR rips somewhere out there. In the source code of NEZplug+, I saw references to GBR rips of Last Bible 1&amp;2, Tekkaman Blade (with some hack to make the rip work), and some other titles. Really makes me wonder how much I've duplicated.

<br />See for yourself how much ripping has been doubled (there's a GBR for Drymouth somewhere on this site too).
<br />Still no Tekkaman Blade GBR. Will see if I can get ahold of it.
