Yes, if you're looking only from a SW point of view, mapper #12 is like mapper #3 with a fixed bank and CHR-RAM instead of CHR-ROM, which may effectively not be &quot;totally unrelated&quot; but &quot;quite unrelated&quot;.<br /><br />Were developers offered to have a fixed CHR bank, but with CHR-ROM ?<br /><br />I think most of the confusion would be cleared up if we somehow could figure what official nintendo developers were &quot;offered&quot; and their viewpoint of the situation (I mean, without the iNES point of view, nor the hardware/boards point of view).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Mar 18, 2014 7:32 am</p><hr />

CPROM, TxSROM, and TQROM get &quot;more specific&quot; names because they have different behavior. But &quot;totally unrelated&quot; is stretching it, as the behavior is a small change to the &quot;parent&quot; board. CPROM is CNROM with a fixed bank, TxSROM is TxROM with CHR A17-controlled nametable mirroring, and TQROM is TxROM with CHR A16 switching between two different memories.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Tue Mar 18, 2014 7:10 am</p><hr />

I'd just say refer to the thing you're talking to by the most specific name that applies. This goes back to the principle stated early that we should avoid confusing iNES mappers (software) with boards or ASICs (hardware)<br /><br />If you're talking about a BNROM/NINA-001 combo implementation, you should say mapper 34. If you're talking about the board used by Impossible Mission 2, say NINA-001. Where there are multiple names, use your judgement, e.g. VRC6a is probably preferred to 351951. If you're really uncertain, ask! I'm sure we'll have five different opinions ready for you.<br /><br />Mapper 7 and AxROM happen to be synonyms, since AxROM is not a board name but rather a name we (Disch?) chose for a class of boards, all of which are supported by mapper 7. To me, AxROM is the more memorable and commonly used name.<br /><br />Similarly, if talking about game that uses oversized BNROM (I'm making one at the moment), I'd follow Disch's guideline and call that BxROM, since BNROM is a specific board that doesn't support large sizes, and mapper 34 is a stupid combination of two unrelated board emulations.<br /><br />These are just examples, I don't think we need to attempt a one-size-fits-all rule here; there's a lot of crazy stuff going on in the organization of mapper/board emulation, and we need to think carefully about the appropriate terms as we use them.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Mon Mar 17, 2014 6:35 pm</p><hr />

How about&#058;<br /><br />A mapper is referred to by (in order of highest to lowest priority): ASIC designation, board designation, game or company name.<br /><br />If there's an ASIC mapper, the ASIC designation is used. If there's no clear ASIC designation, or the mapper is discrete, the board name is used. If the board name is unclear or unknown, the game name, or the company which produced the game and/or cartridge is used, and if even that is unknown or unclear, the mapper should default to the name &quot;That Goddamn Unnameable Mapper Nobody Likes&quot;.<br /><br />In the case of ASICs, there's hypothetically an unlimited amount of hacks you can apply to the base mapper, so for example, &quot;MMC3&quot; should always refer to the MMC3 as it is canonically intended to be used, and &quot;modified MMC3&quot; can be used for things like TxSROM.<br /><br />A similar convention can be used for discrete mappers whose functionality is virtually identical to &quot;official&quot; discrete mappers. So if somebody used a GxROM, but with additional circuitry for software-controlled lockout defeat, it can be called a &quot;modified GxROM&quot;, or it can be named after the company that used it, like Color Dreams.<br /><br />Lastly, mappers are never referred to by their ines mapper number.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Mon Mar 17, 2014 3:38 pm</p><hr />

I think it's a judgement call on a case by case basis whether to have separate pages for boards and mappers. In the case of AxROM and Mapper 7, I think these two things are related coherently enough that they belong on the same page. There's not enough to say about mapper 7 alone or AxROM alone to make it worth having two pages, much better to keep them in the same place.<br /><br />Unfortunately the title of the page can only be one thing, so it's either going to be named mapper 7 or AxROM, but that's just a limitation of wikis that we must live with. As long as they both redirect, and we make it clear in the lead (e.g. acknowledge and bold all the terms that redirect), I think this is okay. I don't think it really matters which title the page gets. Actually &quot;AxROM&quot; is really a name we made up for the mapper, isn't it? Kind of a funny case. AOROM, AMROM, ANROM all redirect to AxROM, etc. If there are other boards that fit this mapper, redirect them to this page if appropriate and acknowledge them there.<br /><br />If a board fits several mappers, it's worth giving it its own page. Probably a small disambiguation-style stub to the various mappers it can be used for.<br /><br />If a single mapper fits several boards (which is a common case), unless there's a significant amount of unique text needed for them, gather them to the same page and acknowledge them properly (like with AxROM). If there's too many distinct variations or the page looks like a mess with all of the information, split the article. Just don't split it up until there's enough information on the page to warrant it.<br /><br />If multiple mappers fit the same related class, this is another case where they should be gathered together. For example, mapper 24 and 26 should both redirect to VRC6.<br /><br /><br />Yes, Disch's notes should all be incorporated into the articles and then removed. I did this for them on the expansion audio pages as I went over them. I'm glad zeromus added them to the wiki, because it's good to gather all the information there. It's only the start of what needed to be done, though. We need to go through and clean it up.<br /><br /><br />Anyhow, in summary, yes, I think every mapper should have a page in the namespace, and so should every important named board. If what they represent is sufficiently the same, redirect one to the other to avoid duplication of information. Whether to do this is often subjective, but we can talk out the weird cases.<br /><br />One that's been nagging at me is <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_scrolling" class="postlink">PPU scrolling</a> vs <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/The_skinny_on_NES_scrolling" class="postlink">The skinny on NES scrolling</a>. These definitely need a merge, but I haven't yet taken the time to sort it out.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Mon Mar 17, 2014 6:48 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Technically, yes but the mapper 7 page is an insignificant stub, and should really be a redirect. Actually, I'll do that now.<br /></div><br />I agree, also, thank you very much for your recent modifications, they are very relevant.<br /><br />I think most iNES mapper #xxxx pages should redirect to their corresponding mapper pages, unless for some exceptions, like mapper #37 or mapper #118.<br /><br />Also who had that great idea of pasting Dish notes in the 1st place ? I mean, all mappers were already explained, and then some great genius had the great idea of simply pasting Dish notes on the bottom of that without asking whether this is relevant or sensible. So of course it's no wonder why every info is here twice... Dish's note should be left as it and not be on the wiki. OR all the mapper pages on the wiki should be removed and only Dish' notes should remain but I wouldn't advocate this.<br /><br />EDIT : Seems that <strong>Zeromus</strong> is the culpirt... so if anyone is bothered because of the repeated info, complain to him...<br /><br />Now, in my humble opinion, I think everyone is confused because <span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">names like AOROM, UNROM, etc... are used as if they were mappers. They are not.</span> Sorry guys but just no. They are merely <strong>boards</strong> made by Nintendo that implements some mappers.<br /><br />Once again :<br /><ul><li>Nintendo-made boards can implement multiple mappers, as seen on Crazy Climber (UNROM, not mapper #2) or Bird Week (CNROM, not mapper #3)</li><li>A mapper can be implemented with multiple (i.e. infinite) hardware : The american version of Wizard &amp; Warriors III is not implemented with an AxROM family board despite being mapper #7, I can also made my own mapper #7 board using a dozen of transistors mounted as latches instead of a 74HC161 as a lach, etc, etc...</li></ul><br />I also think that discrete mappers needs to be explained on a single page (as I mentionned above before my edit), but in my humble opinion, this page should be the iNES mapper page, NOT the board (i.e. AxROM) page. AxROM, UxROM, etc... should just be considered as the Nintendo implementation of one or multiple discrete logic mappers, and should be mentioned as such (along with how they were implemented, and whether solder pad config and bus conflicts should be present). In other words, I see no reason why the AxROM page doesn't looks like the SxROM page.<br /><br />So here is my vision :<br /><ul><li> All boards or family of boards have a page, explaining ONLY the boards, which hardware they have, which solder pad configs they do, and which mapper(s) they implement. (by the was there is no concept of &quot;oversize&quot; here, since we only discuss existing hardware on those page)</li><li> Another page (MMC1, mapper #2, MMC3, mapper #7, etc, etc...) is explaining the behaviour of every mapper, and how they are programmed in a user's viewpoint. They do not mention any hardware nor non-ASIC chips nor boards, just links to known board pages implementing those hardware. The concept of oversize of course belong to here.</li><li> Mapper #1 should redirect to MMC1, and mapper #4 should redirect to MMC3 and so on, there is no room for duplication here. HOWEVER, mapper #7 should not redirect anywhere because there is no ASIC, so instead the board is &quot;free to be implemented in the way the user wants it to&quot;, including AxROM, an Acclaim made board, a repro pack from RetroZone or anything else. The implementation can have SRAM or not have it, can be &quot;oversize&quot; or not be, etc, etc....</li></ul><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Mar 17, 2014 3:15 am</p><hr />

Ideally we should probably move most of Disch's documents over to the corresponding non-iNES description page and leave only a redirect or short description behind. Large portions of the wiki are in a pitiful state of Don't Repeat Yourself.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Sun Mar 16, 2014 12:00 pm</p><hr />
