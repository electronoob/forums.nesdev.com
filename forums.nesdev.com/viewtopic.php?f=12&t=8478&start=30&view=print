<br />What do you mean nowdays you don't have to? All I can think you are referring to is the 32bit flash to SNES DIP36 adapters. While those are a vast improvement over the mess of wires with EPROMs, it could still be better.

<br />
<br />The tension on the wire being bent not 100% right will break off a lot more of the time than any chip actually soldered to the board. Any wired up by hand product when you can have a chip on the board is a bad decision. And that 2nd sentence is just....wrong. Nobody uses wires stand-alone because they have a high rate of failure because 1 wire will probably fail before 32 pins on a PCB soldered right.

However personally since I clean cartridges which involves taking them apart, it's not good if there is a big mess of wires connected to components. It's nicer if they are all soldered to the board.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />All electronics have some sort of wires. To be honest Nintendo's boards aren't exceptionally well engineered, and a floating ROM chip on them puts them into the category of very poorly engineered. Not only is a floating ROM unsightly but you run into poor VDD decoupling, transmission line issues and signal delay. It might "work" for SNES, but these practices will not work in more critical or high-speed applications.

<br />
<br />Question is, do you want a cart that looks authentic and good in your collection, or do you want a cart that is in a super fami shaped shell that is not like the other snes games?
