Anyway, I actually got in contact with what was one of the big data miners of the game and as a bit of a reference, they showed me this, which details what the chips are and how the system is laid out <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/2014/console-hacking-2013-omake/">https://fail0verflow.com/blog/2014/cons ... 013-omake/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I never realized just how much of a Frankenstein creation the Wii U is; Nintendo really went through great lengths for backwards compatibility, emulating in both hardware and software, and either in full or in partial depending on what they could get away with. The CPU is actually just three overclocked GameCube/Wii ones, which are completely identical except two have a 512KB L2 cache, and one has a 2MB L2 cache (who knows why they didn't just divide it evenly). Unlike the DS that could do away with some of the original GameBoy hardware, the Wii U actually uses everything the GameCube/Wii had in native mode, meaning a theoretical, backwards compatible Wii U successor would be a total clusterfuck of hardware and would actually still be compatible with the GameCube.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

(Why didn't they just divide <em>this</em> evenly? Why is so much power concentrated in one CPU?)<br /><br />The default way of thinking about programs is single threaded, and having to write a program that divides work into separate parallelizable workloads is an additional design problem, and even if you can do this, you will still very likely have a &quot;main&quot; thread that probably needs the majority of resources. Similarly it makes some sense to have a &quot;main&quot; CPU to run this on. There's nothing unusual about this.<br /><br />Symmetry can be useful, but isn't <em>necessarily</em> a useful property, and your typical parallelizable game workload probably does not split into 3 equal parts. (Plus they probably had any number of other design constraints that neither of us can speculate about that could have made a bigger cache for one CPU cost effective.)<br /><br />A converse way of putting this: why didn't the SNES have a second 65C816 with 128k RAM to run the sound instead of the SPC? Wouldn't it have been better to have another CPU that was exactly the same instead?<br /><br /><br />(The Xbox 360 did in fact have a 3 core PowerPC where all were identical, and you probably could find some arcade machine that uses 2 of the same CPU with one handling music. The more symmetrical cases do exist, I'm just advocating that it's not a given that it's an advantage. The relevant problems for games aren't symmetrical, like they are for e.g. bitcoin mining.)

And then there was the difficulty associated with programming the RCP microcode for developers who were allowed to do so - apparently critical bugs were easy to generate and hard to find.  The memory architecture and RAM latency caused issues, and it was only later in the system's life that Rare managed to figure out how to stream textures through the texture cache (something I think the PlayStation did automatically - it might have been part of the SDK, but the upshot is the same).<br /><br />I haven't programmed either one, so this is all hearsay.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Ps1 games better looking than a N64 game???</div><br />Compare Carmageddon 64 with Gran Turismo 2 (or Twisted Metal 4 for that matter).  Or Hexen on N64 with Quake II on PSX.  Both game libraries exhibited a wide range of graphical quality, but there was a surprising amount of overlap considering the difference in power.<br /><br />The comparison can depend somewhat on taste (and on brand loyalty), particularly when weighing &quot;BlurOVision&quot; against jiggly jaggies.  But for a couple of reasons PlayStation games tended to have (or look like they had) higher-resolution textures, the console had proper support for clamped additive transparency (Body Harvest is the poster child for why this is a good idea), and I get the impression that it was easier to maintain a high fill rate.  The ability to use large quantities of reasonably high-quality full-motion video and prerendered backdrops was an obvious advantage, though nowadays we don't care as much.  Also, I believe some highly-regarded games, like Metal Gear Solid and Crash Bandicoot, deliberately limited their environments and/or onscreen perspective in order to jack up the quality of what you were allowed to see (I believe Crash in particular used prebaked triangle ordering; note that one of the most frequently cited ways to improve the N64's fill rate was to turn off the Z-buffer).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Rahsennor wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Too bad the console didn't get more (any?) good games.</div><br />There were a bunch of highly regarded Wii U games.

I don't think the SDK was involved with it in any way.<br /><br />Then again maybe it's misleading to call the N64 texture memory a &quot;texture <em>cache</em>&quot; in the first place. The official developer documentation calls it simply texture memory (TMEM).

People who actually had one tend to agree that it had a great library.  Some of the popular ones:<br /><br />Splatoon<br />Smash 4<br />Captain Toad<br />NSMBU<br />SM3DW<br />Super Mario Maker<br />Wonderful 101<br />ZombiU<br />DKC Tropical Freeze<br />Nintendo Land<br />Tokyo Mirage Sessions<br />Lego City Undercover<br />Rayman Legends<br />Yoshi's Woolly World<br />Hyrule Warriors<br />Paper Mario Color Splash (seems to have gotten a bad rap for no good reason)<br />Star Fox Zero (it seems like either you get it or you don't)<br />New Super Luigi U<br />Mario Kart 8<br />Bayonetta 2<br />Pikmin 3<br />Xenoblade Chronicles X<br />Breath of the Wild<br /><br />That's excluding ports, multiplats (mostly), and indies, and there were good games in all three of those categories.</div><br />...seriously? Super Mario 3D World is the only one on that list I actually enjoyed. Super Mario Maker is the worst 'game' I've ever played. SSB4, MK8, BotW and XCX all felt watered down compared to their predecessors - they're bigger, but they're still only filled with around the same amount of fun. Hyrule Warriors is just yet another identical Warriors game with Zelda characters painted on. Captain Toad is a cute gimmick. And so on.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just too old to appreciate them. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" />
