Many people treat RGB PPU's as some kind of treasure and will go through all the trouble of hunting them and mod'ing their NES's... 
<br />
<br />I don't know if it's just me, but... most of the time the composite looks better! OK, we could live without the dot crawl, but the color blending makes it look like there are many more colors than just 3+background per tile... Look at the screenshots in that thread... doesn't the composite look much nicer (disregard the color inaccuracies)?
<br />
<br />I just don't get the whole quest for the "sharpest possible pixels". Emulators will make the ultimate sharpest awesome images ever, and it's no fun at all. It just brings out the low number of colors available.

I can also understand that many of us have big screen HDTVs and the output of a standard NES is horrendous on these modern monster displays. I'm at the point now that I'm considering buying a small color television for NES playing instead of putting it on my 55" 1080i mitsubishi.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I read too much in your comment, sorry. Well for me the colors formed because of video artifacts and fuzziness is part of the experience, and I'm enough of a purist that I will go to the extra effort to get it.
<br />
<br />This reminds me of CGA on a PC, there were several games that would draw in monochrome and I had no idea why. Until I found out what happened when you plugged it into a TV set instead of the TTL monitor. Look at the image with the monochrome bands, they turn into several nice colors because of the terrible way that chip handles generating its composite signal.
<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter#Special_effects_on_composite_color_monitors" class="postlink">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter#Special_effects_on_composite_color_monitors</a>
<br />
<br />It seems that there is also an effect on NES composite that isn't present with RGB (or "raw" emulation). Although far less obvious of an effect compared to CGA's.

<br />
<br />I think some people prefer the PlayChoice look because they remember playing an unauthorized copy of a given game on an emulator more fondly than playing an authentic copy on an NES.
<br />
<br />That said, I'm experimenting with dither patterns that leverage NTSC artifacts to blend colors in one of my games, in order to approximate 8x8 pixel areas of the seven solid colors that the design document requires without having to go MMC5. After a few informal tests, I found that I can trust Nestopia's NTSC filter enough to make the dither patterns look enough like my Sharp CRT SDTV that I don't have to go downstairs all the time to test on my PowerPak.

I might agree that on systems with more colors the RGB output looks better, but on the NES, although a bit fuzzier than RGB, the composite is overall richer.<br /><br />Look at the Solstice title screen. Look at all the folds in the guys clothes, it's got real texture in composite (same goes for the block he's standing on), but is just a dithered mess in RGB. His hands also have a much more skin-like color than on RGB.<br /><br />Now look at the in-game shot. In composite, the walls have a different hue from the ground, making the room look much better. Look at the floor tiles. Their upper left side has a thin highlight, that makes them look much more 3D, compared to the plain RGB version<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It may come down to a matter of taste for some people, but for me, RGB is quite superior to composite.</div>
<br />I agree with you on that, I just started the topic because I wanted to find out why, as composite looks much nicer to me.

<br />
<br />And like tokumary Nesticle would give me more nostalgia that the actual system (hironically).
<br />
<br />Althoug modern systems, especially the ones using interlacing, looks bad with composite. Many PS2 games flicker horribly on my old TV beacuse they are probably designed for modern TVs.
<br />
<br />Another thing that looks quite good is the 2xSal filter. Exeption : The chessboard dithering patterns turn into diagonal lines which doesn't look exeptionnal but that's pretty much what happen with NTSC filter too.

<br />I can't look at those filters for too long, I really don't like them. HQ2x sometimes looks better, but the picture just looks smudged to me. Nowadays I practically select my emulators based on whether they include NTSC filters or not.

<br />
<br />I 2nd that.
<br />and add this
<br />Color bleeding and pixel crawl on composite is horrendous.(genesis,tg16, nes, neogeo, sega master sytem)
<br />As a little kid id drool at ultra clear pictures in magazines
<br />Especially the Nintendo player's choice guide (big black book)

<br />
<br />i use to use a c64 monitor when i was young for my games( i still 
<br />have it now out in my work shop and it works great) composite looked much better on it than any set i tried that was 27 inch and larger.
