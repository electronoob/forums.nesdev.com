		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When I work with 16-color sprites instead of 4-color sprites, I work just like traditional art; block the shape in first, put base colors in, then use lighting and shadows to sculpt the 3D form in. For 4-color sprites, I tend to just cheat and not worry too much about shading, unless I'm drawing something really large, but care needs to be taken that certain regions of the same color don't overlap or touch in a way that makes something look ambiguous.<br /><br />So when you change your restrictions, some things get relaxed, but other things require more focus as a result. Therefore, I see NES and SNES art as equals in difficulty.

Sure, the NES had its share of bad art too, but to me it seems this usually happened when people who weren't used to doing art decided to give it a shot for whatever reason (low budget, small team, whatever), but when actual artists were involved, the worst that would happen on the NES is that the graphics would end up looking too simple, but not necessarily bad. On the SNES however, it looks to me like actual artists often ended up making bad use of gradients, contrast, and the console's resources in general. It might be just an impression, but I honestly feel that it's easier to screw up when you have more things (colors, resolution, animation frames) to put in place.

The technique <em>is</em> different because you need to focus on different things, but I don't think it's any harder or easier to get something to look good on either console.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I see the pirate has been made a little smaller.  I was also going to mention that I -just- noticed that the Pirate used to have a pink nose.  I'm not sure how well the pink would stand out from his skin if this were an NES game, so seeing how it blended it well, I figured it would be rather wasteful to waste a single tile from the scanline limit when you couldn't really see it.  Then again, I don't know how to use Blargg's NTSC filter, so I can't judge.<br /><br />Also, Tepples' comment about &quot;pixel piracy&quot; gave me an idea.  It's not the primary focus of the game, but you can find weapon blueprints across the game world, and you take these to a weapon making shop to make the weapon.  It will essentially boil down to a game of picross, which will be a blown up version of the weapon's sprite.  Sound cool, huh?  Just don't steal my money making idea from me, okay?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Isometric and oblique 45 look really cool, but are much harder to pull off on the NES, because of all the overlaps. If you end up deciding on one of these, I guess oblique 45 is more fitting.<br /><br />The other 2 look more like your typical NES game. A side view is very limited in terms of interaction with the environment, so oblique 90 would probably be the next best choice IMO.
