Plugged in an extra old 2 gig microSD card formatted correctly that I pulled from an old cell phone, and everything loaded on the NES Powerpak! I tried Super Mario 2 Lost Levels, Mega Man 4, and Magic Jewelery,  didn't notice anything strange or slow.  I honestly was surprised it worked.  Anyone else done this?  Any potential downsides?  Want me to confirm or test anything out with it?

<br />
<br />Yes it is the usual vagueness you'd expect out of China, <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /> but supposedly from what I've read it transfers at the real speed of the microSD card.  So Class 2 is 2 MB/s, and Class 4 is 4 MB/s and so on.  a 133x compact flash card is by comparison maybe 20 MB/s.. The card that comes with is maybe 6 MB/s read and 3 MB/s write.  I'm not saying this is a perfect replacement for Compact Flash cards, but it was certainly interesting to find that the few games I tested with it seemed to work without any noticeable issues.  If the NES processor isn't actually doing any work and reads the compact flash card as if it were a parallel device, then it could be a decent alternative for people.  What max speed does the NES read a cartridge at anyways?  
<br />
<br />I kind of like it cause I can just push in the micro SD card and it pops out, leaving the rest of the cartridge in there.  Still, I'm no expert.  Hopefully it doesn't damage the PowerPak somehow.. though I can't personally think of any reason why it should.   Which is of course one of the reasons I posted.

<br />Let us not forget that Voyager 1 was launched in 1977 and is still in operation near the edge of the solar system.  I like to think of it as a NES in space.  You're welcome, aliens.

<br />The NES itself might not have been manufactured in the 70's, but its CPU was, and I'm pretty sure most of it was technology that was already in use during the 70's, that just happened to be more affordable in the early 80's. His statement may look weird, but it might not be as wrong as it seems.

The fact that the console itself was manufactured and distributed in the mid-80s doesn't invalidate that statement?  Doesn't Famicom mean "Family Computer"?
<br />
<br />Wait, what am I saying?!?  I have no idea, I must be smoking crack, because present-day line of x86 PCs are also "70s computers" since their CPU microcode solely emulates x86 (read: 8086, circa 1978 or so).  No wait, I'm wrong again!  They're all "18th century computers", because they're using capacitors, and those were discovered during the 18th century.  Yes, the NES is an 18th century computer.
<br />
<br />...now, doesn't all of that sound highly pretentious if not downright preposterous?  This is absolutely a discussion of semantics, so let's reflect:
<br />
<br />Calling the NES or Famicom a "70s computer" because of its processor is just as accurate as my above pretentiousness.  The original statement was "70s computer", not "70s processor".  The term <span style="text-decoration: underline">computer</span> is not synonymous with <span style="text-decoration: underline">processor</span>.  The term "computer", even today, is still an appropriately vague term that means "everything inside of the box" and not "just the processor inside", and that is even more true/applicable when referring to a home video game console.
<br />
<br />I won't reply to this thread past this point because apparently my :o reaction has not only resulted in an semantics debate, but a completely ludicrous and off-topic one as well.

A modern Athlon family CPU has vastly different microarchitecture from an 8086 while using the same instruction set, involving simultaneous out-of-order processing of instructions.

<br />The NES is composed of a late 1970s CPU and an early 1980s PPU and APU. But in a topic about CompactFlash, the CPU is the only part of the computer that the PowerPak's CF circuit can see.
