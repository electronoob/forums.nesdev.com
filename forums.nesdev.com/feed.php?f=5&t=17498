Discord is very attractive compared to IRC for many reasons.  <br /><br />First is the availability of channel logs.  You can see all messages posted in a group for all time, even if you only recently joined the channel.  You don't need to be logged in to capture messages.  On IRC you can miss stuff if you are not logged in.  However, for a channel like #NESdev there should be a fairly complete log available from the participants who are always logged in.  <br /><br />Second is the ability to go to all your channels after a single login.  On IRC you may need to login to EFnet for #nesdev and Slashnet for #flyfishing and IRCnet for #somethingelse.  These servers may have different login requirements, some take longer to find an active host etc.<br /><br />Third is the ability to attach files, photos and short videos directly to the chat.  The discord phone app is especially helpful here.  The phone app will notify you of new messages a channel or private message without pulling up the program.<br /><br />Fourth is the ability to correct mistakes and delete messages.  While this can be abused, I hate it when I misspell words or have to reenter text because the original made no sense or could be misinterpreted.  <br /><br />I have never had any difficulty in connecting to discord and I have been using it for almost a year.  I'm not logged in 24/7, but I cannot remember a time during this period when I was unable to connect to Discord unless my internet connection had an issue.  IRC timeouts have occurred for me not too infrequently.  <br /><br />There are some downsides to Discord.  Discord channels can be broken up into topics, which can make it difficult to follow the activity on a channel if there is a lot of new activity.  Discord requires a certain modernity to your hardware to use, IRC can be accessed on computers as old as an Apple II.  I do not know if Discord censors messages that some or many may find inappropriate, but on most IRC servers, you are limited in what you can say only by the mod, not the program.  HexChat is an IRC program which keeps easy to search and read text files of the logs.  <br /><br />I am not a huge fan of the data mining of Facebook, Google or Discord, but nothing is truly free in life  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> — Tue Aug 07, 2018 7:48 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">zzo38 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">zzo38 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Also, if wanted, you can implement multiple protocols on the same service, e.g. a IRC server that can also communicate to Discord in case you like Discord.<br /></div><br /><a href="https://www.bitlbee.org/main.php/news.r.html" class="postlink">bitlbee</a> already exists and does exactly this.</div>That is, I think, a client side program, what I was asking for was server side program (that doesn't require the client to register with Discord or to install any special software).</div><br />It's a service interoperability/translation daemon, a.k.a. an IRC-based gateway daemon for non-IRC services/protocols. Where you choose to run it is your choice. It could be run on a server somewhere, always running; it's your choice and under your control.  Your IRC client (pick whatever you want) client connects to it.  You then <a href="https://www.bitlbee.org/user-guide.html#commands" class="postlink">configure bitlbee</a> in real-time through IRC commands, <a href="https://wiki.bitlbee.org/" class="postlink">what services/protocols</a> you want it to connect to (see the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">account</tt> command).  The point is that it does what was asked.  But the nice thing about bitlbee, and its the main point, is that you don't have to install a Discord client, a Slack client, Skype, LINE, Steam, Facebook, blah blah blah -- you install/run an IRC client of your choice, install/run bitlbee (wherever you want), and that's it.<br /><br />Yes, there are some features that IIRC don't work quite right (ex. file transfers are a common complication).<br /><br />This is more a comment for Tepples than you, but bitlbee does not, however, <a href="https://bugs.bitlbee.org/ticket/576" class="postlink">keep logs</a> (i.e. you will only see stuff while your IRC client is connected). You can clearly see in that ticket people have reservations about such a feature for all the same reasons I already covered in previous paragraphs.  I am far from in the minority about concerns over centrally-stored stuff like that -- particularly when there is a single commercial company involved who could be bought at any moment by, say, an advertising-centric agency that decides to harvest petabytes of logs and strip out Email addresses and private URLs to then sell to third parties.<br /><br />The only other thing I can think of that's multi-protocol, but purely client-side (i.e. a program you install yourself), is <a href="https://www.miranda-ng.org/en/" class="postlink">Miranda/Miranda NG</a>.  That *does* offer logging, but it's a client-based program, i.e. if it's not running you don't get the messages (unless the protocol service itself stores them and delivers them the next time the client connects; there are many protocols like this).  I used (an older version of) Miranda back when AIM + ICQ + Yahoo + MSN were at their peak usage -- because all the native Windows clients were absolutely horrible and some did shady crap behind the scenes.  Eventually, though, that (older) version of Miranda turned into a pile of junk (all sorts of UI-related bugs), and protocol supports (esp. for MSN) started getting really bad/flaky.  The Miranda NG team looks to be totally different people/developers, except for George Hazan, who historically has been top-notch at writing protocol interfaces/translations.  But Miranda is still reliant on existing services, i.e. for Discord, all your crap is still stored on Discord servers (just like if you were using the native Discord client).<br /><br />As for &quot;not registering with Discord&quot; -- to use Discord, you *have* to register with Discord.  The same goes for Slack, and pretty much any other protocol that's managed/maintained/run by commercial companies.  You're forced to choose a login/password, and often give them an Email address (for all sorts of reasons, some legit, some probably not).  That's just how they work.  IRC is the one incredibly open protocol that doesn't usually work this way (there are authenticated IRC servers, but they're uncommon).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Sat Jul 07, 2018 11:36 am</p><hr />

While bouncers have technically been available for IRC since forever, they were never an easy packaged turnkey item like they are with Discord.<br /></div>Still, as I have mentioned, it is possible to make a IRC server software that will automatically save logs (I have modified a server software to do this before, although only for permanent channels; you could also program it to do for all channels if you wanted to do). And it is of course better than what you describe for Discord, that reading the logs doesn't work; of course you can just download a file and it does work. (I have previously implemented my own log format, but if I redid it today I will instead use the format now used at <a href="http://esolangs.org/logs/" class="postlink">esolangs.org</a>.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle">zzo38 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Also, if wanted, you can implement multiple protocols on the same service, e.g. a IRC server that can also communicate to Discord in case you like Discord.<br /></div><br /><a href="https://www.bitlbee.org/main.php/news.r.html" class="postlink">bitlbee</a> already exists and does exactly this.</div>That is, I think, a client side program, what I was asking for was server side program (that doesn't require the client to register with Discord or to install any special software).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4734">zzo38</a> — Sat Jul 07, 2018 11:01 am</p><hr />
