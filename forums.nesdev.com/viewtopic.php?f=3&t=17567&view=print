		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Through discussions in <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=12925&amp;start=75#p150519" class="postlink">a previous thread</a>, I created a 13th-order Elliptic filter consisting of 7 biquad segments.  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YNmSEgk.png" class="postlink">Here's a plot</a> of the frequency response produced by Octave.  The cutoff frequency was set to 20000 Hz and the filter attenuates the signal down to -100 dB by 22000 Hz, satisfying the Nyquist criterion for the traditional audio sampling rates of 44100+ Hz.  Furthermore, I wrote a test program that records the gain in decibels for a range of frequencies (a very slow Fourier-like Transform) and it reproduced Octave's plot almost perfectly and validated the implementation that I later plugged into <a href="http://nintaco.com/" class="postlink">Nintaco</a>.<br /><br />I finally got around to running that test program against Blargg's Blip_Buffer.  I set the clock rate to 19687500 / 11 (NES NTSC), rounded to the nearest integer.  The sample rate was set to 48000.  I set range to 65536 and I generated sine waves with half that amplitude.  And Blip_Synth was set to blip_high_quality.  Here are the results: <br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zmtcE0G.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The filter is attenuating frequencies below 20000 Hz, worse than a first-order low-pass filter.  But this is the first time that I ever tried using the Blip_Buffer; I assume I screwed something up.  Can someone try to reproduce this?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Up to roughly 19kHz, that graph looks to me like what I'd expect for a first-order lowpass at -3dB point (corner frequency) of 17500Hz. Namely, in the decade from roughly 1.7kHz to 17kHz, I see very gradual attenuation from 0dB to -3dB, as expected, and the slope between 17kHz and 19kHz looks like a first-order lowpass to me.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Blip_Buffer provides treble and bass frequency equalization adjustment.  In the original post, the Bode plot shows the default values.  Below is flat equalization (bass = 1 Hz, trebel = 0 dB).<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QNdrI1n.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />It's flat up to 16 kHz.  From there, there is gradual attenuation until about 21 kHz, then it plunges to -25 dB by 26 kHz.  <br /><br />That's not bad.  Above 26 kHz, it always stays around -25 dB.  It would be nice if the attenuation were stronger.  -25 dB is what you get when you pop in foam earplugs (though of course ear plugs attenuate all frequencies).  It's a significant reduction, but it leaves things audible.<br /><br />The plot above was produced using the blip_high_quality setting.  Blow is the result of blip_low_quality.<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uWRLMdg.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />This suggests it might be possible to further increase the cutoff steepness with greater performance cost.  However, for efficiency, Blip_Buffer appears to fully operate with integer maths.  The current high quality option may be pushing that design to the limits already; this is hinted by the fact that the quality constants appear to be precision bits (e.g. blip_high_quality = 16). <br /><br />I did not test how performant Blip_Buffer is over the double-precision 13th-order Elliptic filter mentioned in the OP.  But, assuming it is much more efficient, it's definitely a sensible option for emulation on low-end hardware given its filtering characteristics.  On modern desktop hardware, better sound quality could be achieved via more advanced floating point filters.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The sinc is an infinite impulse, but this is a finite impulse approximation.<br /><br />On a broad level, when you cut it to that finite length, the cuts leave &quot;sharp edges&quot;. It helps to smooth those edges off, which is what a windowing function does. Any way you cut it there is some tradeoff in error, the windowing function is a way of shaping and managing that error (sort of choosing which frequencies it will be concentrated into). Hamming is a commonly used one.<br /><br />This article seems to be fairly well written: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function</a><!-- m -->
