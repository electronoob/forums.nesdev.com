Been a while since I posted.<br /><br />Since last time, I've enlisted the help of someone at work, who has kindly offered his services to write a tv emulator that sits within my nes framework (which saves having to switch to crtsim to check the video signal).<br /><br />The original nes emulator was a pin accurate CPU core and some C code mashed into the shape of a PPU. Since that post, I've now re-written the PPU core into EDL, and moved the clock dividers into the respective chips. In the process upgrading the compiler and adding support for some of the features it still lacks.<br /><br />The screenshot below is squashed, the link below it - will take you to a full res version. The NES window is a traditionally emulator view (without fancy post processing). The NTSC window is obviously the TV emulation (apologise for the darkness - its not the tv emulators fault - The signal I'm feeding is still not quite to spec).<br /><br />The logic analyser is currently probing the composite video signal along with the DBE pin on the PPU and the M2 clock on the CPU.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://savourysnax.github.com/EDL/images/nes_squashed.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />For full resolution click below :<br /><br /><a href="http://savourysnax.github.com/EDL/images/nes.png" class="postlink">http://savourysnax.github.com/EDL/images/nes.png</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5156">SavourySnaX</a> — Wed Feb 01, 2012 11:47 am</p><hr />

I really like the idea of emulating at the pin level.  Technology like this could actually allow for bringing old hardware back to life.  So is there any thought to being able to slap the 2a03/2a02 on a FPGA with some sort of breakout board that could allow you completely replace a burnt out CPU/PPU on the original motherboard?<br /><br />I doubt it would really be worth the expense currently as the console it's self is fairly cheap to replace entirely, and not much cheaper than a FPGA.  But this might not be the case once we all get old and grey, once they start to die off and sizable programmable logic costs pennies.  Of course they won't be 5v at that time either, but that's what level shifters are for.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Mon Jan 16, 2012 5:23 pm</p><hr />

Blimey - I didn't realise so many people would remember me.

Interesting idea. I always wanted to see the NES simulated like that... The approach of emulating the individual chips is perfect for the NES because of the insane amount of mappers it uses... If each mapper is emulated as its own chip(s), we could easily add new ones without messing with the CPU and PPU.<br /><br />Sorry if I can't be of any help though... I'm not much of a hardware guy, and I certainly don't know anything about NTSC signals! =)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Jan 15, 2012 12:10 pm</p><hr />

Hi all,<br /><br /> I've been reading this site with great interest over the last month or so. <br /><br /> In my spare time, I've been working on an emulation description language (although to be fair its more of a cpu description language). <br /><br /> I have written i8080,z80,6502,6510 and begun an rp2a03 &amp;&amp; rp2c02 core (yes the last one is not a cpu - more on this later). The difference between my emulation and others is that I emulate the pins. Which means interaction with the cpu cores involves feeding data onto the chips pins themselves. this allows nice tricks like (from i8080 core):<br /><br /><img src="http://savourysnax.github.com/EDL/images/timing.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /> Now as you can guess I've decided to play with NES emulation, but I`m trying to be different (aren't we all), and so I have been playing with CRTSIM (which is a program that reads NTSC composite(ish) signals and produces a display from them - not written by me, but google crtsim and you will find it).<br /><br /> At present I haven't got very far - the rp2a03 core is basically the 6502 core I wrote, with the bcd stripped out and a dma emulation put in. I had a crack at getting the rp2c02 to generate composite video signals this weekend - the below is where i've got to so far.<br /><br /><img src="http://savourysnax.github.com/EDL/images/nes_crt.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />There is a lot of corruption (if i disable the colour parts its cleaner - so the corruption is probably my colour clocks being wrong), also the brightness is reduced from what it should be.<br /><br /> The emulator at present is dumping out an .ntsc file, which i then feed into crtsim and get a nice movie.<br /><br /> I hope to make some more progress next week and sort out the colour, but i thought (even broken) it might be of some interest.<br /><br /> My homepage has lots of details about EDL. Nothing NES or CRT related posted yet, I want to get things a bit more stable first.<br /><br /> Homepage : <a href="http://savourysnax.github.com/EDL" class="postlink">http://savourysnax.github.com/EDL</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5156">SavourySnaX</a> — Sun Jan 15, 2012 9:04 am</p><hr />
