		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi,<br />This weekend i found an old Commodore VIC 20 in a warehouse while volunteering for a 'rummage sale'. I grabbed it and a Tandy 1400 LT. The VIC still had the box and was missing a key, but i replaced it.<br /><br />The roof of the warehouse was leaky, and the VIC was submerged in water that smelled like sulphur. I have yet to turn it on. But I dried out the manuals and I learned that the 'Programmer's Reference Guide' has a section on Assembly with the MOS 6502. <br /><br />The 'Programmer's Reference Guide' has about half the book dedicated to 6502 Assembly; A complete list of opcodes is included, with tutorials. and further explanation.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #12E053">So this is my question:</span></strong><br />Since the RP2A023 is a 6502 without decimal mode, would I be able to use it to program a NES? I have a powerpak and a Toaster Nintendo with the 10NES chip disabled and grounded, as well as a battered AV-Modded Top Loader.

You can probably learn useful things about the 6502 with this VIC 20 book, but it will probably use a lot of platform specific code for input and output, and that won't help you on the NES at all.

While the CPU runs the program you coded, the PPU renders pictures to the TV. In order to change this picture, the CPU has to feed the PPU with new information. The PPU has its own memory, not directly accessible to the CPU, where the pattern tables, name tables, attribute tables, OAM and palletes (i.e. everything necessary to generate pictures - if you don't know what these are, read the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU" class="postlink">wiki</a> and play with FCEUX's PPU debugger) stay. Since this memory is not directly accessible to the CPU, there is an address port and a data port which are accessible to the CPU, and this is how the program writes to and reads from PPU memory (it first tells the PPU which address is to be accessed and then writes to / reads from the data port - the address auto increments, so that you don't have to specify an address for every byte). There are also other PPU registers that affect how the image is rendered, such as the scroll registers, which can be changed by the CPU. Most of these PPU updates must happen when the PPU is &quot;resting&quot; between frames (otherwise the picture gets all messed up), a period called VBlank.

Maybe because it was the first assembly language I learned, but objectively speaking, the design of the 6502 is simpler. This means that the Z80 can do more with less instructions in most cases, but the instructions are more complex. In the end, because of this inversely proportional relationship, the complexity of coding for each CPU doesn't vary much. The same can be said about the speed of both CPUs... The 6502 needs lower clock speeds to perform as well as a Z80, because even though instructions on the Z80 do more, they take longer to execute.
