They seem to work well.<br />Just having trouble writing Hirom games which are larger than 4mb such as Tales Of Phantasia or CHrono Trigger Crimson Echoes.<br />My boards are 8mb ones.<br />I have tried expanding the roms to 8mb using Lunar Expand.  This did not work.  I also expanded the roms padding them with 0xff but this did not work either.<br /><br />I know for other roms that are under 4mb I pad them to 4mb and then double them and this works fine.  Obviously I can only pad the roms bigger than 4mb and cannot double them.<br /><br />Anyone have a solution for this one?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When using 8MB boards you need to mirror the ROM image to fill it up to 8 megabytes. An easy example with a 2mbyte or 4mbyte game is to copy the rom data until it fills the whole 8mbytes. So copying a repeat of the ROM data 2 times with a 4mb file and 4 times for a 2mb file. I'm not sure about ToP which I think is 40 or 48 megabits? INL should have an idea. But basically it'll involve copying data from one part of the ROM to fill up the remaining area to reach 8 mbytes.

I flashed ffv, dual orb 2 and dq6 and they worked great<br />I still could not get tales of phantasia to work using the method you suggested.<br /><br />for the 12MB board it does not erase using the erase_snes12-16MB header.<br />it erases using the regular Erase_SNES.bin <br /><br />Also does the Star Ocean 96Mbit no sdd-1 rom work on your boards? I could not get it to work.<br />I know the rom is good since it works on my SNES POWERPACK. I can get it to flash fully with out any errors and but it black screens. On my super wild card DX 2 it reads the rom internal data atleast.<br />i did remove the header and corrected the checksums. but still no go.<br />Is there a special way i have to split/combin the rom?<br /><br />This is a great project your undertaking. these boards are great quality. i will be ordering more of them to make some carts for my friends who are big snes rpg fans. They want to play them on a real snes. Thankyou for all the time you spent on this

Did a breath of Fire II using the German translation patch.<br />In an emulator it works perfectly.<br />Wrote it to one of the infinite cards and it starts up fine but just gets into a loop after you enter the characters name in and hit the start.  Goes back into the enter characters name page.<br />Is it something to do with the way the save game works for this rom?<br />Can someone possibly test this and let me know?<br /><br />Thanks

I don't think I've actually tested a 3MB HiROM game before.<br /><br />I'm not sure how the original carts were setup for these non-power of 2 sized games.  One can assume there was a 1MB chip and a 2MB chip.  Not sure which was first in the memory map.  Either 1MB followed by a 2MB or vice versa.  Wherever the 1MB chip is, we need to double it up.<br /><br />I just tried doubling up the first 1MB and inserting it in the front of the rom image.  That makes it act as if the 1MB chip was in the lower address half.  That kinda booted, but was all glitched up...<br /><br />Trying doubling up the last 1MB at the end of the file now.  That's booting up nicely so far...  And still no dice...<br /><br />Actually I'm guessing it's an SRAM issue.  The menu normally goes back in the menu after a new profile, but since the profile has been created it allows you to select it.  So if things weren't getting saved in sram properly, then when it stepped back, the profile wouldn't be there.  <br /><br />I was originally testing on my v1.0 firmware release I believe.  Updating to v1.1 brings some fixes on the SRAM sizing and toggling banks with the hi/lo switch.  Giving v1.1 a try doesn't seem to fix the issue though either...  I'm curious if giving the game TOO MUCH sram would cause this issue...
