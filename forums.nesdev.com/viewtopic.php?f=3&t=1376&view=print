		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />According to Blargg's APU test ROMs #01 and #02, the length counters are clocked immediately when writing $80 to APU register $4017.  It doesn't specify whether writing $C0 will also clock them, but test ROM #02 fails if not, because it attempts to clock them by writing $C0.
<br />
<br />However, there are a couple of games that have issues with this.  The "Metroid" ROM that I have (I don't think it's a hack) constantly writes 0xc0 to $4017 (once per frame, I think).  If I allow the length counters to be clocked on this write, then some of the sound effects are much too short.  One example of this is the "farting" sound made by a bullet hitting an enemy, another is the jump sound effect.
<br />
<br />The "Legend of Zelda" game also has problems in the intro song, because it writes $FF to $4017 several times per frame, and some of the square channel tones are short if clocking on this write.
<br />
<br />More concise version:
<br />- If I clock the length counters whenever bit 7 of $4017 is set, then some popular games don't sound right.
<br />- If I clock the length counters only when writing *exactly* 0x80 to $4017, then the games sound okay, but test rom #02 fails (test ROM #01 still works).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The $80-&gt;$4017 write doesn't trigger a length clock, per se.... it just starts the 'mode 1' sequence.  And it just so happens that the mode 1 sequence has a length clock very early on (1 cycle in, as indicated in the readme that comes with blargg's tests)
<br />
<br />At any rate... bit 6 has no impact on the mode (it simply disables frame IRQs).  So a write of $C0 or $FF will have the exact same effect as a write of $80 as far as the length counters are concerned.
<br />
<br />The "Mode 1 Timing" section in the readme outlines it pretty well.
<br />
<br />
<br />Anyway... you seem to be going around and dodging the obvious problem, here.  If test 1 passes and test 2 fails... then most likely the problem is in your length counter reload table.  This would also explain the short notes in those games you mentioned -- if you don't set the length counter to the proper values, you will have those notes cutting out as well as test failure.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My length counter table is correct.  If I allow length counter clocking during a write of bit 7 of $4017, I pass all tests in Blargg's first 3 APU test ROMs.
<br />
<br />But I think you've answered my question -- I haven't implemented the strict mode 0/1 timings yet.  I should do that before complaining about broken games.  :)
<br />
<br />Thanks for the clarification.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That would do it.
<br />
<br />If you have the same "mode 0" setup when in mode 1... and just add an additional length clock on $4017 write... you'll end up clocking the length counter 3 times by step 4 in the sequence.  Whereas in mode 1 (or mode 0), the length will only have been clocked 2 times by step 4.
