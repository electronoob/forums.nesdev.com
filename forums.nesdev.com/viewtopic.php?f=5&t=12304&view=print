The owner has long stopped selling it and I'm really looking to get one for my SNES proto needs. I got the Super UFO Pro 8 which turned out to be quite a disappointment, and I got it on recommendation as well.<br /><br />Also, any experience between the Retrode and Mash-Mods when it comes to backing up ROMs? Maybe I could settle for one or the other...<br /><br />I'd REALLY appreciate the help...

That's what I'm really looking for; as mentioned, specifically prototypes.<br /><br />I'm going to change the thread title since I've decided to be a bit more open in what I'm seeking. Either the Retrode 2 or Mash-Mods will do.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Given the docs I've skimmed (in about 20 minutes), I'd say the Retrode 2 is probably the better choice.  Don't bother with classic console copiers, because it's unlikely they'll work with certain types of carts (varies per game and what exactly the game contains, esp. if there's special chips), not to mention you'll need a ton of floppy disks as the likelihood of having a classic PC with LPT port running, say, Windows 98 or Me (you'd have issues under 2K/XP/7/8/etc. due to lack of direct I/O port control (note to readers: don't lecture me about magic DLLs that can provide this, that would mean the OP would need to write his own software)) and pray classic DOS utilities like UCON would work for you (not to mention that the LPT port was set to classic SPP; ECP/EPP tended to be quite unreliable).<br /><br />If money is a concern, then a cheaper alternative is to mail whatever carts you have to someone who has one of these devices + can dump the games for you.  But let me guess, you don't like that idea... in which case, buy the Retrode 2 (it's a one-time purchase).<br /><br />(Mainly for <s>Espozo</s> Erockbrox) No, SD2SNES will not dump games -- SD2SNES, like the Everdrive, is intended to run ROM images (from an SD card) on actual SNES/SFC consoles.  What the OP is wanting is a device that allows him to take a cartridge, plug it into a device hooked up to a PC, and dump the contents of the cartridge into actual ROM files.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, you hit the nail on the head, koitsu.<br /><br />I've definitely chosen not to go with any of the archaic backup devices; mainly because yeah, I lack the old hardware that these devices were designed to support. I'd say it's a tough call between the Retrode 2 and the Mash-Mods when it comes to prototype versions of games; if this was a matter of retail games, I wouldn't even bother, heh. <br /><br />For the Retrode 2, I've read a lot of praise and recommendation, but I've also read some criticism of it; one criticism was rather recent and had enough weight to convince me that the SUP8 was the better choice, but that device didn't turn out to be all that great.<br /><br />For Mash-Mods programmer, I've read nothing but great things about its backup feature. Some of those good comments even say it goes over the Retrode 2 in that regard. But it's definitely a more obscure piece. The owner has left the scene quite a while ago, after a very limited production run.<br /><br />Both are USB-based backup devices, which is just what I'm looking for. Money's not an issue for me right now; so much so that I'd be willing to get one of each if they become available. I have quite an amount of protos and the library will be expanding, its turnover also on the rise; it's more feasible for me to back them up myself.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was under the impression that entry-level programmers still seemed to use LPT-as-GPIO for various reasons. These make USB programmers more expensive:<br /><br /><ul><li>The kernel-mode code signing policy of 64-bit Windows isn't friendly to smaller hardware makers. </li><li>Nor is the USB patent license, I'm told. IEEE 1284, RS-232, and I²C are more than 30 years old, and SPI is a codification of practices that have been in place at least since the Famicom. Your hardware can internally use one of those old interfaces with a chip to translate to and from USB, but you still need an expensive vendor and product ID. </li><li>USB programmers need a boost converter to produce a +12 V to +15 V programming voltage for older EPROM technologies. </li></ul>

Very buggy.<br /><br />The mash-mods programmer is also an excellent device for reverse engineering coprocessors (with your own custom software)
