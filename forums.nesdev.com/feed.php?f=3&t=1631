People made law in the goal to protect people. You cannot drive too fast because it presents danger of doing accident, and so risk for you and your surroudings. You cannot steal from someone else because it is annoying to him, and after all it is also bad for your own honnor (well, it all depend who you are). You cannot piracy software because it would harm the entreprise that legitimaly produce it and make it run down its buisness, inolving people loose their work, and it would have bad effects on the industry.<br />Law has not been created to be annoying, it has been created to help one to live with eachother with the least conflicts as possible. At least thats what I honnestly believe.<br />Then, the law also have to adapt itself to technology. Unfortunetely, theese days the technology go too fast and the law sometimes cannot follow it.<br />Come on, download NES games doesn't hurt the buisness level of Nintendo. They have enough money to run at least for now, and even if they wouldn't, not downloading NES game but buy used games instead won't change the finnancial situation of Nintendo at all, since they aren't producting it any longer.<br />Now, effectivly, this may cause the downs of sales for remakes, wich still have the same levels, characters, ect... that in copirighted NES games. But remake aren't innovative and weakens the game industry. For some reason, Nintendo seems silly and release tons of remake and innovate nothing. No wonder why they complain : It's not to an entreprise to submit their custommer and decide wich games they like and they will buy. It's to the entreprise to do their best for their custommers. So if Nintendo wants release remakes people are not interested of because they downloaded the original, and Nintendo claims it is illegal to do so because the remake don't sell, its their fault. Make innovation, sequels not remakes.<br />By the way, I can like remakes, if they are well done. I bought the GBC version of Dragon Warrior III, wich is much better than the NES one I have on my PC. But this is pretty rare.<br />I also think I'd never buy Fire Emblem GBA, Megaman Battle Network GBA, Dragon Warrior III GBC, Sword of Mana GBA, Dragon Quest on PS2, Breath of Fire on PS2, and maybe no GBA console at all if I didn't downloaded prequels to the above games for NES and SNES for free, making me like the games and buy their more recent sequels.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Jun 09, 2006 9:10 am</p><hr />

The "pirate" originals and some licensed also fall into this category. I should haven't mentioned it at all, since I can now think of several homebrew games I've tried which are of decent quality (your Tetramino and several of the 4K competition games come to mind). I shouldn't badmouth unless I'm specific about it anyway, otherwise I involve unintended targets, so ignore all my blather here. :)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />My question referred to a hypothetical emulator that could be used with homebrew but not with commercial games.<br /></div><br /><br />I see. Perhaps a DRM scheme (oh noes!) where the developer uses a special assembler that digitally signs the result. This would limit play to only those things with source code, though some filter would be necessary to prevent bypass by converting commercial games into a bunch of .byte directives or mass-disassembly and then feeding that to the assembler.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Thu Jun 08, 2006 7:01 pm</p><hr />

So we need to perfect the <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=656" class="postlink">"stop-n-swop"</a> method's reliability for dumping a cartridge (the poor man's CopyNES), then get Memblers to produce the boot cartridge and his serial adaptor cable that plugs into the joypad port.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I finally decided myself that download games that have been my mom more than 5 years ago or so cannot be illegal if there is no new production of the said game, even if this is false.

Copyright was originally meant to expand the valuable public domain of intellectual creations by providing further economic benefits to creators, but it's been warped into a means of indefinite profit for the creator. Games which have been dormant can be brought back at any time, for example the ports to Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance, and soon the Wii. The particular format of the games isn't in production anymore (NES cartridges), but the copyrighted work (the code and game characters) is still being maintained.<br /><br />I'm always trying to learn more about copyright law, so don't hesitate in correcting me.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Thu Jun 08, 2006 10:51 am</p><hr />

I've heard many different version about legality, and I finally decided myself that download games that have been commercialised more than 5 years ago or so cannot be illegal if there is no new production of the said game, even if this is false. This just seem logical. Some people invokes the argument that emulation could rather lead people to buy more games, but Nintendo looks to disagree. Overall, I found those conclusions. Emulation :<br />- Promote the sales of sequels of earlier games (if you downloaded and liked a game, chances are that you're interested in buying a sequel to if for a more recent game machine)<br />- Doesn't influent much sales of new games<br />- Break down sales of remakes (why buy a remake if you can download the original, wich is often better ?)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Jun 08, 2006 10:50 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">WedNESday wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Wrong. If you write an emulator for the purpose of letting others play downloaded (or any illegal ROMs) then the emulator is illegal. Nintendo's own legal web page states so.<br /></div><br />Nintendo is biased. Nintendo states what it <em>wants</em> to be illegal. But in the United States, there's something called "substantial non-infringing use." For instance, VCRs may be used to mass-duplicate movies (obvious infringement), or they may be used to time-shift television programming (which the Supreme Court has labeled as fair use). Likewise, emulators are useful for 1. homebrew and 2. ROM images dumped with CopyNES. But if you <em>advertise</em> an emulator as useful with ROMs obtained through illegal means, then you're "inducing" infringement. The controlling case law is <em>Sony v. Universal</em> and <em>MGM v. Grokster</em>.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Jun 08, 2006 10:20 am</p><hr />
