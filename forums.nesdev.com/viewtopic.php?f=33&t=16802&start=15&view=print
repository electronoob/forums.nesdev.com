		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't understand what happened with this game... It has some of the greatest graphics I have ever seen on the NES, the use of color is absolutely fantastic! And then there are the 3D sequences...<br /><br />I don't mind the &quot;Tyrannosaurus Tex style&quot; of textured walls (I wanted to see it done on the NES, actually), but the dimensions of the blocks are really inconsistent... You can't see openings very well until you're really close, it looks like things get distorted as you move around. I ended up using the tiny circular map almost exclusively, since it's so hard to tell what's going on in the 3D.<br /><br />But more surprising than the 3D view itself, is the interface around it. How come this screen looks like a quick MS Paint sketch while the rest of the game has such amazing graphics?

In hindsight, had i been able to begin work earlier, there would have been more headroom covering for the point below:<br />-Then my involvement got delayed by ~3-4 weeks mid-process because of real life (sorry, calima...)<br />-Lastly, some assets had to be cut out of sheer size - which essentially means i spent precious time on the wrong things. <br /><br />As for the 3d maze graphics:<br />It wasn't originally planned/asked for, but I had hoped to have time left to work on the 3d environments' GUI + additional graphics, but as it were, i was only able to finish my original assignment (design for equipment and monsters, graphics for title+ending and all the battle sceneries, enemies, equipment, battle effects and spells, boss, and then animations). <br /><br />I think it's a good start, but it didn't get the polish it deserves. Throw more time and ROM on it and i think it'll be quite the experience if we commit to it further. <br /><br />Basically, my personal lesson is that any project needs a months' buffer time in case anything unplanned affects your schedule negatively - and if it doesn't you can either spend that buffer on further polishing things, or just sit back and be satisfied. As it were i sacrificed sleep and postponed dayjob tasks to get back on schedule somewhat in the nick of time, which isn't optimal from any angle. All while calima had to deal with dependencies not being fixed on time.<br /><br />Comparing to the process of bringing project blue to the table, i had a couple of months more to work on that which meant the downtime i had didn't affect the project visibly.
