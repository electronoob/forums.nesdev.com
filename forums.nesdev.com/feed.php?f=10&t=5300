That was very helpful Memblers.  I have taken on your concept for storing animation routines and I am building off of that.  I am still figuring out what I can do with it.  I believe it can be a very useful piece of code for managing sprite animation during gameplay too.

I don't know how helpful it'd be, but you could use my animation code or get some ideas from it maybe.  I posted about it here:<br /><a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=493" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=493</a><br /><a href="http://www.parodius.com/~memblers/nes/animate.asm" class="postlink">http://www.parodius.com/~memblers/nes/animate.asm</a><br /><br />It may be hard to follow at first, but it definitely has worked well for me (I've used it unchanged in several projects).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Jun 14, 2009 2:45 pm</p><hr />

As a follow up, I found out where my problem with the jumping was after a lot of tinkering.  Memblers and tepples were correct about resetting the scroll position after writing the palette, but I also needed to clear the PPUADDR by writing 0 to it.  I only realized I needed to do that after reading section 53 of Chris Covell's NES Tech FAQ.<br /><br />Regarding my previous question about animation, I would love to hear some more from anyone with some suggestions on how to proceed.  I would like to get this right the first time if I can...  er, well second time I guess in my case.   <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />Thanks<br />PH<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3918">PH5</a> — Sun Jun 14, 2009 1:55 pm</p><hr />

I will check on the scrolling, from what I have seen, that seems likely.  Is it a quirk of the machine that the scrolling needs to be reset all the time?<br /><br />I have been keeping code in separate files as you suggest.  One big file quickly becomes unmanageable.  I have also been using macros when appropriate, like I use a couple to save and restore the registers when I enter and leave a subroutine.<br /><br />So if I am understanding what you are suggesting related to animations, have the animation for each object in a file, essentially a block of bytes that defines how each object moves.<br /><br />So in pseudocode:<br /><br />objectid<br />starting position info<br />starting time/frame info<br />direction info (?)<br />frames per step (?)<br />ending position info<br /><br />Something along those lines, and then a more generic rendering engine that manages creation, movement, and deletion of each animation?<br /><br />PH<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3918">PH5</a> — Sat Jun 13, 2009 2:35 pm</p><hr />

Hi everyone<br /><br />I have some questions for you, but thought I should introduce myself first as I am fairly new to NES programming.  I've been a fan of the system since I was a kid in the 80s.  It was the first system I had, and so it holds a special place for me.  I took up collecting classic video games a few years ago, primarily for the NES.  I currently have around 200 games for it now, most of which were found "in the wild".  I have wanted to make an NES game for a long time now, but have only recently become motivated enough to give it a serious attempt.  I have read most of the documents on this site, and studied the message board as well.  I also have a good deal of programming experience, and plenty with 8-bit processors.<br /><br />I've decided to go with a puzzle game for my first try.  I figured that would be easiest for me to figure out, as for my game I wouldn't need any scrolling or physics that a platformer might need for example.  Also, puzzle games are probably my favorite genre for the NES, so that helps keep me interested.  I won't go into the details of the game idea at this point because it is in the very early stages, but think Lolo or Kickle Cubicle, and you will be on the right lines.<br /><br />So other than some testing I have done to make sure my concept is feasible on the NES, I have been spending my time on my title screen.  I thought that would be a good way to get the bugs out of my code for sprites, background, input, animation, and sound/music.  I am pleased to say I have most of it working, save for sound effects and music.  That is coming up later.  I've made an avi for anyone that wants to take a look at what I have done so far.    <a href="http://www.alpinecom.net/phackmann/nes/rottenroad.avi" class="postlink">http://www.alpinecom.net/phackmann/nes/rottenroad.avi</a>  Please forgive the final walking sequence for the character, as I need to work on that some more.<br /><br />So, if you have looked at it, I have the title fading in with a blue orb in it.  The blue orb is a sprite, and I change the palette values to simulate going from black to blue.  I found that the only way I could do it was to shut the PPU off, write to $3F00, and turn the PPU back on.
