<br />
<br />At any rate, you can stop a sample prematurely if you need to (just turn the DMC off before the sample finishes playing).  As for making it longer..  you'd probably be better off creating a new sample from scratch, since a conversion from DMC to WAV and back to DMC would probably result in a <em>lot</em> of quality loss and distortion (and those samples aren't exactly high quality to begin with).
<br />
<br />But I'm still a little confused.  I thought you were just reproducing the song... and if that's the case... the same samples that worked in the original would suffice for a remake, wouldn't they?  The only way I can see you needing longer samples was if you're slowing the tempo way down.  But maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're doing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't really know what those numbers are either. I just know that they relate to time somehow. In frinika (a free midi composer), you can highlight a note and it shows you the length of that note visually and with that number format (0:000). I was hoping to just dive in there and figure it out myself.
<br />
<br />I can't just take the samples and increase the pitch because that would alter the time the notes plays. You told me yourself; it's like when you increase the speed of a tape recorder. It plays at a higher pitch (like a chipmunk voice) but it IS faster. What am I supposed to do if I need a note to be one second at 2g then two seconds at 2g? The way I see it, I need a dmc sample for each and every single specific note. This means I need 23 total, which I can use to build the entire piece.
<br />
<br />So I guess the next question is - how do you turn off a dmc sample prematurely? Are you talking about just pushing stop or pause while running some recording program?
<br />
<br />Believe me, if I could just create these DMCs from scratch I would. All I can rip from the track (using nsfLive!) is the four samples. How else could I do it?
<br />
<br />In conclusion, the song has 13 notes and 3 different note lengths. I can only get 4 samples at some indescriminate note length. If you can think of a better way to do this, please let me know.

<br />By turning off channel 5. In some playback engines, you might need to create a short, silent wave to interrupt the playing wave.
