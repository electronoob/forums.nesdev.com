		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I wonder if the art style of <em>DKC</em> is why <em>Yoshi's Island</em> was delayed. I remember an article in <em>Nintendo Power</em> stating it was delayed for a graphical overhaul, to provide the hand-drawn look with which we're familiar. Perhaps that was Nintendo's fallback in case the market didn't take to Advanced Computer Modeling.</div><br /><br />But ultimately didn't the market eat up the ACM? I know I was excited.<br />A lot of Mario RPG was ACM style as well. Another very memorable game.<br /><br /><br />I know it's wikipedia, that quotes this (how reliable is this source?):<br /> &quot;When Shigeru Miyamoto first demonstrated the game to Nintendo's marketing department, it was rejected because it had Mario-related graphics rather than the waxy, pre-rendered graphics of Donkey Kong Country&quot;<br />Kent, Steven. &quot;The &quot;Next&quot; Generation (part 2)&quot;. The Ultimate History of Video Games: The Story Behind the Craze that Touched our Lives and Changed the World. Roseville, California: Prima Publishing. p. 518. ISBN 0-7615-3643-4.<br /><br />So ultimately Miyamoto in one of his few butthurt moments, took every chance to hate on DKC. Although since then as of the &quot;Iwata Asks&quot; stuff he's relented.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's probably why I've heard that Yoshi's Island graphics are made like they are, to counter DKC graphics (also honestly it's like the only thing that would look colorful enough in mode 0, which has four scroll planes but uses 2bpp graphics).<br /><br />Has anybody tested the sound from the Retron 5? If it's anything like Mega Drive emulators, expect the sound to be way off.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Audio enhancements are pretty unimpressive imo. I got this thing as a gift, my report is the edge connectors won't last the test of time like their original counterparts. A lot of people are reporting bent pins already within 3-4 days. I built some passthrough carts so I can insert a cart one time and just put my games into the piggybacked edge connector. It's working out pretty well, I gotta do the SNES and Famicom still but other than that the NES and Genesis slots have a layer of protection from poor quality of Hyperkin's choices in the slot. Strange as they pushed the release date up to fix issues with the edge connector pins and they still seem to remain. A lot of RMAs and generally frustrated customers. The Genesis slot is particularly tight, I can see that slot being a huge source of discomfort for consumers who've not worked around this.<br /><br />The video filters are like any emulator and I find that I prefer to just keep them off as well as their enhanced audio. The colours are inaccurate, as is the sound. Licensed game compatibility is not 100% like they touted and hack games are slowly getting some support. The only use i have for this thing is really convenience on my desk. I have 17 consoles over by my entertainment centre but sometimes I just want to sit at my computer and jam in some carts, so we'll see how it works in that capacity as I begin to put this thing through some full game plays. I don't think save game importing to the cart works either though the last firmware upgrade may have fixed this.<br /><br />Also pull your games out from the side too. Pulling from the top will just add to the stress of cart extraction.
