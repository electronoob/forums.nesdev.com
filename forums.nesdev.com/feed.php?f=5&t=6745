Yeah, it's only the ones like these that survive immediate deletion.  The ones that almost seem plausible, but not really (pretty much no one will ask a random question in 'General Stuff' with no introduction as a first post).<br /><br />What I hate to do is delete the first post in a thread.  If it's that bad I prefer to delete the whole thread, which also means in a few cases, some amusing joke replies to spammers have been nuked with it.  That's really the main approach I've used over the years to make the place seem spam-free.  And trying to get to it before there are replies.  But this one was sneakier than most.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Aug 12, 2010 2:51 pm</p><hr />

idk, a decent amount of topics started by these bots have entertained me.<br /><br /><br />Ban "user" is a good idea after checking there ip and being reasonably sure they are not a real person, but this is already done. locking the topic could be done in a case by case basis.<br /><br />I think the policy of common sense the moderators here already follow covers these situation.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=188">peppers</a> — Thu Aug 12, 2010 12:57 pm</p><hr />

So as a rule of thumb, I guess if someone start a thread that is not NESdev related, we should check his posts # and if inferior to 10 or so, then not answer to him and for moderators lock the thread / ban him.

Although <a href="http://www.sandboxie.com/" class="postlink">Sandboxie</a> isn't free, it can be used indefinitely, it will at most show you a nag screen every once in a while.

They give a fake sense of security, because when shit gets real ugly they can never restore the previous stability of your system. They might even get rid of the viruses, but your system always gets crippled in some way. When damage is done, it's done.<br /><br />And the eternal race between new threats and definition updates is something really annoying to be caught in. I'd much rather not care about being infect at all and just wipe everything out in one go, like is possible with sandboxes, virtual machines and reboot-to-restore.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Aug 09, 2010 1:44 pm</p><hr />
