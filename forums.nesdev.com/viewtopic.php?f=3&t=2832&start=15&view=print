Some people photocopy whole books at work, though. And of course, if you own a photocopier you can copy whatever you want, just as you can easily copy a CD or a DVD these days, if you own the burner. I believe this is all considered illegal. No one wants you to rent movies and copy them (they expect you to buy movies later), but many people do it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The law should be worried about people that kill people, not this crap.</div><br />That is the argument that most drug people used to use in the 70's (and still uses today), however, I still found drug is a major problem.</div>
<br />It is, specially here in Brazil, because of drug traffic. Many people die because of that, so in the end it's still people killing people over drugs. I'm really not concerned about drug users. I believe that the only wrong thing to do in this world is hurt others. If one is stupid enough to use drugs, well, let them be stupid, as long as that doesn't hurt anyone else. That is my opinion of course, and I'm sure many disagree! =)
<br />
<br />It just pisses me off to see the police worring about unimportant things such as piracy (which only affects the pockets of huge companies) while so many people are dying. It's annoying to see the police picking on the small guys while there's much more serious stuff out there, real criminals to catch.

The risk is that someone not so stupid could be stupidly influenced by stupid people for any purpose, and that really happen often. I'd say I agree if you also consider lying, stealing, injuring and so as "hurting".<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">t's annoying to see the police picking on the small guys while there's much more serious stuff out there, real criminals to catch.</div>
<br />Actually that's what they does. I've <em>never</em> head of anyone arrested by the police or whathever for minor copying or hacking purpose. Only serious hackers get bothered, and those are real criminal because they can seriously alter commercial companies or banks. I really don't think video game market is the first bothering subject of the police, heh.

<br />I also never heard of anyone busted at home for copying a DVD, but once in a while I see street vendors having their products apprehended (because they have no licence to sell, not because of pirate goods), the stand where the products were being displayed broken to pieces in the middle of the street, and if they didn't run I have no idea what would happen to them.
<br />
<br />Now, these people are only trying to make a living. Those who sell things on the streets are usually humble people, and I fear that they'll resort to other worse types of money-making, such as robbing or dealing drugs, since they can't sell legal products because they don't have a license, and can't afford one.
<br />
<br />That's what pisses me off. People are robbed in buses all the time, but the police is busting an honest street vendor, making sure that the government or big companies don't loose money, while the people that were robbed are robbed even more by the government... They really don't care about the people. Of course the people will also "steal" when they have the opportunity. Only that the government or companies are not punished for robbing us.
<br />
<br />Is it just me or is this thread becoming a little... err... I can't even find a word! =) I don't mind it, though, as long as people discuss these things in a civilized way! =)

<br />
<br />I think what they're saying is making backup copies is legal, but using those copying devices like the ones on ebay are illegal. The echo's what I said before.
