		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I'm back with another problem. When I add more code to my reset part of game loop (were I thought actual game logic went), I get screen garbage.
<br />
<br />So I'll tell you how I thought the game loop was supposed to go.
<br />
<br />- init everything
<br />1. Wait for the begining and end of the NMI
<br />2. Do game logic.
<br />3. Loop to 1
<br />
<br />Everything works great until I add more clock cycles to step 2. Then I get screen garbage. 
<br />
<br />I do the normal wait for vblank in step one. Then I have a flag tell me when the NMI routine is over.
<br />
<br />Obviously, I'm doing something wrong and I don't understand why this is happening. I thought the kind of screen garbage I was getting only happened if the NMI was to long and I started screwing with $2006 outside of the vblank period.

<br />Else, this shouldnt be a real problem exept about the speed of your programm.
<br />
<br />If everithing above is done I can't see what's going up. Be especially carefull with your variables/buffers.

<br />
<br />Yep. I've got all of that covered. I can comment out any bit of code in the reset loop and the problem goes away. Must be taking to long. But what I don't understand is, "Why the graphical errors if the NMI occurs during the middle of the reset loop/ the reset loop takes longer then the time from the end of the last NMI to the begining of the next?". I don't use the same zero page data in the reset and nmi parts. Drawing buffers will only occur if the proper flag is set. 
<br />
<br />It has to be the slowness of the last bit of code I added to the reset loop. Finally tipped the scales as far as how much time I could use, but like I said, why the graphical errors (name table, attribute table, horizontal rows flickering)?

If your main code extends past draw time into vblank time, there might not be enough time to finish screen updates before the next draw time. If all your vblank code runs from NMI, it might be encountering an inconsistent game state. And are you making sure that your NMI code pushes all CPU registers that it modifies?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you dont' have the scroll values reset and the screen switched on by the end of VBlank, you will get graphical errors -- even if you're no longer doing drawing routines.
<br />
<br />You must have the temp PPU address set to your desired scroll values (do this by writing to $2000 for the nametable select, and writing to $2005 twice to set the scroll values).  Then you must have the screen switched on (either BG or Sprite rendering enabled via $2001)
<br />
<br />The PPU Temp -&gt; PPU Address only occurs ONCE just before rendering, and the screen must be on for that transfer to take place.  If you take too long prepping your scroll vars they won't be updated and the screen will start drawing from the wrong position.
<br />
<br />So in VBlank... do all your drawing, do your sprite DMA, set your scroll vars, and make sure the screen is flipped on -- and try not to do ANYTHING else, as time is extremely limited.

<br />
<br />Also not the problem.
<br />
<br />I just made my main code to slow. I'll see what happens after I start rewriting my main loop update so that it doesn't hog so much time.
<br />
<br />Thanks everyone. And thanks for tolerating my new-b-ness.
