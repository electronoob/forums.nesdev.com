<br />Could you add more precision ? I really found it weird. Normally it should always break no matter how it was read or write. Maybe I (or someone else) should try all ways to acess to a memory location. Maybe FCEU does ignore the tricky dummy read and dummy writes (for example if you do sta $4000,X with X = 15, $4015 is being read as well, but maybe that doesn't triger in FCEU).

That's good to know, since I thought it was really complex to set up. I was thinking you had to make some big elaborate expression, but it's good to know you can just throw a value in there!<br /><br />And yes, we are talking about the FCEUXD debugger. I really am not a fan of Nintendulator's debugging features compared to FCEUXD's either.</div>
<br />
<br />Something else I forgot to mention was that it's kind of picky with what you put into the Conditions box. For instance, on the values, you can't put the $ symbol. You can also use the &amp;&amp; and || symbols to expand on things. So, some examples in the box would be:
<br />
<br />A == #16
<br />
<br />A == #0c || X == #03
<br />
<br />X == #20 &amp;&amp; Y == #04
<br />
<br />I believe you can also use the greater-than/less-than signs, but don't hold me to it, as I can't remember for sure.
