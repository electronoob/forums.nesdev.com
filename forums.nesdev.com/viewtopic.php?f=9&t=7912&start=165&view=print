<br />
<br />Wow I stand corrected!  I guess it helps that you've only got the one FC connector.  leaving out the NES connector and extra FFs for the expansion pins opens up some breathing room.
<br />
<br />I don't see anything at a glance.  The built in checking with the software is really your best judge.

<br />Nice work!

<br />EDIT: did you use that proteus tool that you usually do again?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I've had some people asking me to make another run of these kits.  Honestly time is a little strapped right now, but if I made a few dollars for my efforts compared to last run I'm willing to crank out some more.
<br />
<br />The board will be nearly identical as before with the two errors I'm aware of fixed. (USB lines and bootloader switch)  
<br />
<br />I'd do the full unassembled kit with one connector only, for $60 including shipping (international first class mail).
<br />
<br />Add $15 for assembly and $8 for the additional 72/60pin connector if you'd like them both.  If you'd like a USB cable thrown in add $3.
<br />
<br />Other than that it's the same deal as last time, just keep in mind there is no case.
<br />
<br />If anyone else wants to get in I'll probably just add a paypal checkout to my site to make things easier that last time.  I'm in contact with the pcb supplier to find out delivery time estimate but I would expect Late Jan/Early Feb.
<br />
<br />In other news progress is being made to rewrite the firmware and host code from the ground up with something that is a lot quicker and more user friendly.  I hope to have basic discrete mapper functionality in the next couple months.  But I wouldn't hope to see anything with MMC1/3 etc for some time.

<br />Wow looking good!  What method of copper masking do you use?  Is it iron on toner method?  If so,  what paper are you using?
<br />
<br />As for the driver, I'm not sure off the top of my head what I'm running but it's probably the same.  Why do you ask?  Are you having issues with it?

I saw people talking about using expansion pins as a mapper disable, but I wasn't sure if that got implemented or not.
<br />
<br />One thought I had was that since there are multiple 5V pins on the connector, you could make a dev cart that uses one of them as a mapper enable line (simply and the clock signal to the flip flops with it). When running in nes it will always be high, and when programming, you can drive it as needed, and all components will still be powered from the other line.
<br />
<br />I am considering projects that use the expansion port, so I am a bit weary of using that line on my dev cart.

<br />
<br />Nothing has been implemented for the EXP pins on the official Kazzo softwares (anago and unagi) and wouldn't expect them to be since they are japanese based projects.
<br />
<br />I tried to modify some code and things with their implementation and ran into a lot of issues compiling and grasping their code which lacked commenting (except the few Japanese ones).
<br />
<br />The thing I really like and use the kazzo for is to just use the hardware and create my own firmware.  I've done this for a few different things and am currently working on the first build of the NESDEV1's avrcode on it.  That I will then port over to the final board.  The run I made up (and posted plans) provide extra access to the EXP pins that the original kazzo did not.  So with the hardware I made up you could do the EXP0 (or any EXP pin really) mapper disable with your own hardware.  If people are interested I'll release my firmware after I get it cleaned up and everything.  I don't have much plans to implement dumping of all kinds of mappers and such.  But the USB read/write ground work would be there if someone wanted to do some development working with the mappers.
<br />
<br />Your idea about anding the power pin is interesting, don't see why it wouldn't work.  You would have to modify the hardware I made though since I just tied all the power pins to 5v.
<br />
<br />I'm curious about your devcart, anywhere we can check it out?  What are you gearing it towards/the goal of the project?

I hope to use it to power a custom-made nintendo: a small form factor PC inside a real NES case, that takes real NES carts and controllers.  But puts out better video.
<br />
<br />It seems to be *really* picky about the cartridges.  I had to clean again games that even the original NES hardware seemed able to read, and generally got a lot of "maybe cartridge connection error" and "error: data is all 0xff".
<br />
<br />But it's working.  I managed to put together a few simple scripts so far for nrom, unrom, and gnrom which all seemed to be missing from the anago download.  They're on GitHub: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/arantius/anago-scripts">https://github.com/arantius/anago-scripts</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />I don't think I have any more esoteric carts in my collection.  The rest are almost all mmc1 or mmc3.  But I might have some small tweaks for those as well.  (Like, the default mmc3 script seems to always do 256k PRG.  It seems to work anyway, but some carts are smaller than that.)
