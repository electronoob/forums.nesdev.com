What if I fill the bus with nothing but 0xDD? (All ROM and all RAM.) Will IRQs and NMIs never fire as a result?</div><br /><br />Interrupts aren't processed after a prefix, including redundant prefixes. As you've noticed, if they did then there would be no way for the CPU to recover. So a sequence of redundant IX/IY prefixes will indeed postpone interrupt processing for arbitrarily long. I think x86 CPUs up to the 80186 or so are the same with segment prefixes (didn't you have to deal with this when emulating the WonderSwan?) Starting with the 286, x86 CPUs started enforcing a maximum single instruction length and throwing an exception if it's exceeded, precisely so that software can't lock up the CPU by jumping into a code segment entirely filled with prefix opcodes. The limit is 10 bytes on the 286 and 15 bytes on the 386 and everything after.

As you've noticed, if they did then there would be no way for the CPU to recover.<br /><br />Neat! That'll make emulation easier, I can just force the instruction() function to not return until a non-prefix instruction has executed. The cooperative threading will save me if the CPU gets stuck in an infinite loop, although trying to capture a save state would cause a lock up. Probably not worth losing sleep over a situation that'll never actually occur.<br /><br />&gt; didn't you have to deal with this when emulating the WonderSwan?<br /><br />Interestingly enough, the V30MZ only guarantees up to seven prefixes in a row to execute correctly. It has an &quot;all bets are off&quot; note if you go beyond that. Of course, not knowing what actually happens, I don't emulate the limitation in any way.<br /><br />More fun for me, just finished a HuC6280 core. Seems the TAI/TIA/etc instructions also delay interrupts until they complete. And those can transfer a full 64KB of data at a very slow six cycles per byte. I think those are officially the longest-to-execute instructions I've implemented yet.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />^ Sure. But if you want to write to vram during active display with Txx instructions, you have to use smaller segments like 32 bytes as not to delay hsync interrupts too long (all writes to vdc regs are buffered, but you have a 455 cpu cycle window to get them written per line). That brings down the transfer rate to vram at 7.5 cycles per byte during active display (all VDC reg access have +1 cycle penalty to read/write instructions), and 6.5 cycles for non VDC/VCE areas of memory.<br /><br /> If you embedded graphics as ST1/ST2 opcodes, its 5 cycles a byte to vram and is interruptible.

The VCE might sync the VDC, but the VDC itself can be set to have multiple hsync interrupts triggered per line (VCE line/frame work).<br /><br /> Anyway, that's what it does. Fires during hsync so the cpu can update regs before the next scanline. The regs are buffered, so you can take as long as you need to write to them. Registers that affect the hozirontal display settings are updated on the next line (X/Y/width/offset/etc), and regs that affect the vertical display setting are updated on the next VDC &quot;frame&quot; (not necessarily per &quot;VCE&quot; frame).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">&gt; (because the VDC start to draw the screen at line 64 and not 0)<br /><br />That really doesn't make sense, either.

Those are buffered per VDC line. The changes take place on the next &quot;VDC&quot; line. What other raster effects do you need? I say VDC line, because it's possible to have more than one VDC line inside of a VCE line. This should be obvious, because if the VDC is in h-pulse window mode, it's waiting for VCE to snap it to the next mode. If the VCE doesn't, then the VDC times out and continues on the next mode/phase by itself. But if the VCE asserts hysnc, it doesn't matter were the VDC is.. it will immediately snap to the phase that follows hsync pulse window (I forgot the official names of these).<br /><br /> VCE reg changes aren't like VDC reg changes. They take place immediately, including changing the resolution (can be done mid scanline).<br /><br /> You're in for a treat.

It's possible to have the VDC draw out the BG tiles as 8 pixels tall, and have it skip other every line of sprites (effectively showing 16 pixel tall cells as 8 pixel tall). Mednafen comes close (4px tall tile cells, 8px tall sprite cells), but it doesn't handle this above case scenario.

And I just found there's a THIRD level of latching to it. The cached BYR value is latched at the start of the scanline. Without that, you'll get momentary flicker when games write the register mid-scanline. Which they do a lot because there's only one background and no windows.<br /><br />&gt; I have no idea how accurate you plan to go with this, but the VDC processes BG and sprite line setup at different 8pixel dot clock segments during hblank.<br /><br />I am limited by the available information. And the available information is unbelievably awful and outdated from 2007 and earlier =(<br /><br />But I want to be as accurate as possible. I just emulated the display start, display length regs. But not yet the display end, sync width regs. Nor the &quot;fun&quot; that happens with out of bounds values (you can apparently make the VDC start drawing the NEXT scanline on the current scanline if your values are too aggressive.)<br /><br />Even with just that, I'm still having troubles. HDS (horizontal display start) seems to act differently depending on the $0400.d0-d1 clock frequency setting (5mhz, 7mhz, 10mhz). Unless I manually fudge the start offset by another ~24 clock cycles for 7mhz mode only, the status bar in Order of the Griffon isn't centered.<br /><br />There's no documentation anywhere on this.
