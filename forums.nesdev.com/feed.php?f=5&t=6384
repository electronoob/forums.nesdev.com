It'd probably be pretty hard to get a bunch of people to work together because of idea clash.  I think most people who have the skills to make games, or are acquiring the skills to make them,  have pretty specific ideas about what they'd like to do. <br /><br /> I've had problems in the past working with friends.  It's difficult telling someone who's working for free that their graphic design isn't uniform enough, or the monster they designed not only doesn't fit the graphic style, but doesn't even fit the game at all.<br /><br />  That being said, if you had a good team together, and they can work well together, it would be possible to make something very amazing.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4250">Ian A</a> — Thu May 20, 2010 7:10 pm</p><hr />

I don't think I've ever seen credits for a console game with just 2 or 3 names (I've never played atari either though).<br /><br />For example, MM1 credits:<br /><br />1 planner<br />4 character designers<br />1 programmer<br />2 sound programmers<br /><br />Granted, people are using a lot more advanced tools now than back in the day, but that's just one person (in his spare time) doing a task that would normally be done by a team (9:00 to 5:00 and getting paid).  I'm not saying it's impossible, it's just pretty inefficient- albeit fun, challenging, etc.  And I think that's why some of the projects around here never get finished.<br /><br />I think a good way to get more homebrew games out would be teamwork.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4148">notinasia</a> — Thu May 20, 2010 4:00 pm</p><hr />

A lot of NES games were made by a half-dozen people. It's easier to get collaboration when 1. a producer is signing paychecks, or 2. there are enough developers in a geographic area that they can meet face to face. Guess what the homebrew scene lacks: money and density.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu May 20, 2010 3:42 pm</p><hr />

Perhaps what is needed is an engine for things like collision and movement that makes designing object behaviors almost as easy as it is in WarioWare DIY. Nintendo has got it to the point where AI is just Action Instructions. Sure, it would be limited, probably to single-screen games, but then at least people would be able to make their own NES games with less need for obsessive dedication.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Tue May 18, 2010 7:53 am</p><hr />
