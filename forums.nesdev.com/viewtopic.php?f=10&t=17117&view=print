		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello Everyone!<br /><br />Let me introduce myself. My name is Kevin and I'm the owner of a small retro gaming store. I've been playing games for as long as I can remember. My Atari 2600 joystick doubled as my teething chewy (I still have that paddle to this day). My absolute favorite gaming consoles are the NES and SNES. <br /><br />I've messed around with different game engines in the past. UT, Unity, Game Maker, RPG Maker, and others. I have a simple understanding of C++, C#, and Ruby. I wrote simple games on my Commodore 64 when I was a kid. And cheater programs on my TI83 in high school. <br /><br />Over the last few months I've been slowly going down the rabbit hole that is NES game development. Resources were few and far between, I found a few ok sites in my searches. Stumbled on NESmaker and The New 8-Bit Heroes. But I was too late for their kickstarter. In the mean time, while I'm waiting for that to be released I figured I'd learn as much as I could about how the NES works. And that's when I found this site! I've been lurking for the past few hours. Finally decided I'll like it here. <br /><br />I'll be reading up on the stickies and doing searches for any questions I'm sure have been answered hundreds of times over. Of course I wouldn't mind being pointed to some great posts for a total newbie like myself. <br /><br />Anyway, I guess I've gone on long enough. I look forward to absorbing as much knowledge as I can.

We were able to use the program on some of our tests.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Three users who have extremely helped me here are Kasumi, tokumaru, and tepples. Loopy created asm6, the assembler that tokumaru, and others, recommended me use.  Shiru created FamiTone and FamiTone2, the free audio engines that have worked really well for me. (edit: Many others have helped me greatly too!!)<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">That's just 5 of the users; there are many many geniuses here.</span> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br /><br />Make sure to absorb from the <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com" class="postlink">nesdev wiki</a> too. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

You seem to have similar programming experience as I had when I started learning 6502 assembly and more, so I say go for it. I learned from the Nerdy Nights series of tutorials, this forum and Nesdev wiki. You will be able to learn pretty much everything about the NES hardware you need to know as a programmer here if you put in effort. Good luck!

These are HUMAN BEINGS who are paid to do exactly what you see here -- make accounts on forums and &quot;pretend&quot; to act like a normal participant.  There are entire companies in Pakistan, India, and many other countries who are hired to do this (it's often roundabout/indirect, e.g. Company X wants to get their brand out, so they ask a reputable marketing company to help, who then relies on several third-parties, who then rely on OTHER third-parties that use companies like I just described.  In many cases, Company X doesn't even know it's going on -- and some, when they find out, go &quot;what the ?!?!? NO NO NO! That's going to tick people off and make our brand look bad!&quot;, to which the reputable marketing company says &quot;Oh, well, we aren't responsible for what third-parties of our third-parties do&quot;.  Isn't marketing great?)<br /><br />Remember: signing up on the forum requires a few questions that bots/etc. can't tend to answer, but a human who can read English and Google a little bit can certainly find the answers.  It would do tepples et al well to rotate the questions out with a whole new set (not just adding new ones -- literally replacing them all), because by now some companies have certainly seen all the questions + have a &quot;database&quot; of answers.<br /><br />So do not let replies in threads fool you.  If it looks like spam, or a sort of &quot;probe/phish&quot;, then it probably is.<br /><br />I don't discuss publicly how I dealt with this situation (when I helped run the forum and site).  It was a manual process and it worked fairly well.  You don't discuss publicly tactics when you know those who would subvert them would read and understand the details.  :)

The email address used for registering was already in a spam database, but was just short of the threshold of being automatically blocked from registering here.  False positives can happen, just doesn't seem very likely..<br /><br />Well, if womentake actually is an NES developer, I don't personally care if they advertise whatever unrelated site.  Just not as a new user, with no post history.<br /><br />Also, welcome to RetroKevin and cdigi, who are witnessing this thread being taken over, haha.

The C64 and Amiga might, but I think that's as far as you can go.<br /><br />I worked on reverse engineering a PCE game the other day, and holy crap - just figuring out how the games communiate with the graphics chip was a wild goose chase between five different websites, each with fractured pieces of information that would occasionally contradict eachother. And that's actually one of the platforms that should be relatively well known.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah there are some parts not fully documented in English yet (like the FDS) but in general the NES is very well reverse engineered and documented for a homebrew community.<br /><br />Regarding PC-Engine, the official English development manual can be found on the internet. It should clear up those contradicting sources, including the confusion of SAT and SATB terminology. According to official documents SAT is basically the PC Engine's OAM (although it is in VRAM) and SATB is a second internal &quot;OAM&quot; of the VDC that must be DMA:d to from SAT (VRAM-SATB DMA) to actually display the sprites. But every homebrew document out there got the terms SAT and SATB backwards (including the debugger in Mednafen).
