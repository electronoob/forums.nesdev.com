Same with PS Move, and there are other various VR control schemes that are floating around at the moment.<br /><br />The Wii U's screen gamepad seemed like it could be used for interesting asymmetrical views, but I can't think of any Wii U game where it actually paid off. With Starfox Zero it actually made the game much harder to get the hang of in a way that was not really fun to learn IMO. I've seen several recent games get paired with a smartphone app to allow other kinds of asymmetrical view like that too, though, so the idea isn't exactly limited to the Wii U. (...and of course the Gamecube + GBA, or Dreamcast controller offered similar things on various scales.)<br /><br />In most cases the controller itself can be divorced from the console, if there's something interesting about that controller that you want to exploit. (...and there's an almost endless supply of obscure novelty peripherals out there if you wanna go spelunking.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have hardly ever played games on any system more recent than PS2, but to my understanding the only real difference is a much larger resolution and maybe better framrate, which is due to progress being made on flat-screen HD TV technology. But even there we reached a point where more resolution would be completely useless (i.e. not visible to the eye). So for the next generation they'll probably try to sell some &quot;3D virtual reality&quot; stuff again even though it has been proved multiple times this was causing major headaches along other problems.

But we are hitting the limits were the problem is not adding more capabilities to the machines its adding more dev time to be able to use them. Content generation is the far larger and harder to solve problem. <br /><br />I think people will get nostalgic for a PS4 in 30 years, ones first console is always special.<br /><br /><br />The only fun thing to do with a PS3 I can think of is to make Farbrausch style demos on the CELL.

A lot of AAA games nowadays look stunning until you try to interact with something, at which point it all falls apart.<br /><br />Some of this is just because developers aren't doing what they could be - running in place in front of walls instead of reacting to the wall is a good example - but a lot of the physics may be waiting on more powerful CPUs.  Fluid dynamics in particular tend to look really bad; a body of water in a modern game can look completely real until you jump in and start splashing around, producing splash effects that would have been unremarkable on the Nintendo 64 and totally failing to alter the lovely realistic wave pattern that looked so impressive a moment ago.  I've seen semi-realistic interactive water in a modern game, but it was an indie game where you play as a swimming frog, and the Reynolds number was super low.  (Also, I'm pretty sure the refractive effect was wrong, as usual.  I don't think I've <em>ever</em> seen correct refraction in a video game, and it's not like it'd be hard.)<br /><br />Video games took a wrong turn somewhere.  Nobody seems to care about world interaction any more; it's honestly embarrassing that the decent physics in Breath of the Wild were such a revelation (and showed up the physics in Horizon Zero Dawn so thoroughly).  Racing games of all things can fail to credibly simulate a three-car pileup.  AI has been mostly stagnant for a decade.  Graphics have settled into a standard way of faking things, and if you go outside the range of stuff that looks good in demos the seams start to show.  Real-time shadows can look worse nowadays than they did on the N64.  The last generation with a standard 60 fps expectation was the PS2/GC/Xbox gen, so all of this photorealistic stuff held together with spit and baling wire doesn't even move smoothly...<br /><br />...what was I talking about?  Right, CPU power.  Maybe the next generation will have enough CPU power to do decent water physics.  I bet you could make a cool jet-ski game or something...<br /><br />Maybe I'm being a bit unfair...

Other games are <em>worse</em>? I honestly thought the physics puzzles in BotW were game-breakingly bad. It's the first game I've played with major physics content, and I thought it was just another worthless gimmick. If this is the state of the art, you're right, it's an embarassment.

Strict exactitude would indeed require the ability to render each pixel at an arbitrary point on an arbitrary polygon based on the refraction angle result for that pixel.  Same with reflection.<br /><br />But there's a large gap between strict exactitude and what actually shows up in games.  Ever notice how in real life, water tends to look shallower than it is?  Something as simple as distorting the underwater terrain mesh based on viewing angle would have been reasonably cheap on the N64, and I don't recall ever seeing anything like it.

Also not in the sequels, where they evidently just targeted the PS2's capabilities and didn't do much to improve the appearance of the GCN/Xbox ports.

If the surface of the water was flat and still, you could render  the entire scene upside down under the water, and use that are your reflected version, or an offset lookup to that for your refracted version.<br /><br />The problem is, refraction and water requires a continuous variation of the surface, i.e. every different angle requires a different viewpoint on that reflection. You can't get all of that from one upside-down viewpoint, you'd need a different view from each point on the curved surface. No-go. In general, the technique is to render the upside-down scene once (and save to a texture) and then use the angle of refraction to warp the lookup to that texture -- this tends to look very bad at the edges of the water, where it will probably be displaced up or down from where it is being told to refract from, but you can try to do some clamping at these edges to restrict the refraction there, or hide it with &quot;sea foam&quot; or something.

If done too realistically, the player may not be able to judge easily what's inside and how deep it is, etc., before jumping straight into a pool, so this may be an acceptable break from reality.
