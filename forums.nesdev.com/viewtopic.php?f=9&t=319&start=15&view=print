		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sepi has been working on a controller playback device from the parallel port (tho without a real NES controller involved in the circuit, his test program just used the keyboard when I tried it).  Last I heard, it's improved a lot since the currently documented version with the addition of the reset signal to the NES.  I think that'd be more useful than NMI, since for the controller read syncing you can just watch the strobe/latch signal.  It would indeed be awesome to replay those 'tool-assisted' speedruns with something like that.
<br />
<br />How well does your USB interface work compared to the RS232 adapters I've made?  (I have tiny PCBs for them now too - they can receive MIDI also, tho that's untested).  Does the NES control the USB lines directly or is there a microcontroller in between?  FTDI chip or not?  Sorry for all the questions, heheh.  Either way sounds pretty cool.  If it can work syncronously then it would be good on SNES too (writing async controller timing code on SNES screws me up royally, the CPU changes speeds!).
<br />
<br />I was going to do RS232 through the controller port originally, I even found a source for NES cables (in fact, email me at gmail.com (memblers@) if you want, maybe we could both get some for cheap).
<br />
<br />Thread has gone way off-topic, but I'm not complaining, heheh.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm using a PIC18F usb part, it's about the same price as a FTDI chip, but gives me an active micro to work with, so I can do rate adaptation, etc..., and let both the NES and PC talk in a way they are comfortable with.  Microchip has example code for being a joystick, and for emulating a RS-232 link, and the parts have several endpoints, so I should (in theory) be able to merge the two together without too much trouble.
<br />
<br />The way I'm planning on doing comms should work perfectly on NES or SNES, regardless of whether the SNES is doing slow or fast cycles.
<br />
<br />The biggest problem is that most of the code is in C for either C18 or HiTech C, and I can't afford a license for either (~$400), so I've got to adapt the asm examples for the PIC16C USB parts.
