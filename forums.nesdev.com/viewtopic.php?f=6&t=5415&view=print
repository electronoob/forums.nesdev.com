<br />I thought you guys may get a kick out of this-
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The NES had something special. The triangle wave channel was a good source for percussive sounds and boomy basses, although it wasn’t very usable for other kind of sounds. I really enjoyed doing the music of Asterix &amp; The Smurfs. Solstice by Tim Follin was my inspiration at that time. I had to learn 6502 and I liked it much more than I would have imagined.</div><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">When I was writing Asterix for the NES and learning the sound chip, I didn’t find information about the right frequency values to use for the notes (the frequency table), and the values of my Game Boy driver didn’t work. So what I did was create a small program for the Game Boy to play each note (12*8 notes if I remember correctly), and another program in the NES to lower and raise the sound frequency with the controller. Then I played each note in the Game Boy and tried to mach its frequency on the NES “by ear”, to find the right value for the registers. How brute is that? Well it worked, but now when I listen to my NES soundtracks I notice that some notes are a bit out of tune. Of course nowadays I would have done it differently…</div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The funny thing is that this guy almost sounds *exactly* like me. No musical training, yet still make songs; listened to mostly chip music/vgmusic rather than mainstream music. Hell, my "Music Box for Sinclair" was "The Music Studio for C64". <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> (Though, I was 10 or so at the time. Playing with Fasttracker came next, and then moving to ModPlug Tracker is what moved me up the music ladder. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />) I even wrote my own music engine for the NES! (though, that was recently <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />)
<br />
<br />Only difference with me is that I didn't quite make a career out of it. :S I did used to pixel-art my own games though, way back in the The Games Factory and Multimedia Fusion days. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />Yeesh, I'm finding so many parallels with this guy. o_O
<br />
<br />Thanks for sharing, this is a very interesting read. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
