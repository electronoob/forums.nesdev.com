I know someone who used to have nightmares about Pipe Dream, and other times just dreamed that she was playing Pipe Dream. I just had a strange one myself and I am not sure what triggered it. Anyways, the dream started out at an airport waiting to fly somewhere (to where, i do not know). In the dream I ended up making it to the security checkpoint to go to the departing gates... and ended up getting in to an argument with them over taking an NES Zapper on the plane. I know I would not be able to take it on board in real life if they happened to check my bags... but in the dream I kept arguing with them.... "its orange and plastic! everyone should know its not a real gun! it cant shoot anything, it has that plastic lens and just makes clicking sounds!". sadly, in the end... they threw it away. It was a sad day in dream land!
<br />
<br />I wanna hear about other NES related dreams, lets have a story time!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I get NES related drams once in awhile but definitely not regularly. It's also not possible to remember the most part of them unfortunately.
<br />
<br />The best I had was about me playing some game (I think the game in question doesn't even exist, it was somewhere between Castlevania and Battletoads) and I discovered a secret alternate path that almost doubled the size of the game, and I remember the alternate path was very hard and very intense, and I guess included a racing level or something in the like (think something like Battletoads).
<br />
<br />But that's about everything. Of course this is never going to happen, because how memory is expensive in NES games, nobody would hide half of it's levels in a hard to find secret.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I actually had a dream about a NES game. Can't recall how old (young) I was at the time, it was like 1-3 years since I saw NES and its games for first time, I think.
<br />
<br />Me and my friends were big fans of the Blaster Master at the time. It actually was the japanese version, we called it Metafight (the only latin word at the title screen). We had just one copy of it, and the cart was glitchy multi-game cart, making the game almost unbeatable. Most of friends gave up after third level, having no idea where to go. Me with a friend managed to go few levels further. There was a glitched boss with almost infinite health (you had to shoot it for real long time to make counter overflow, as I understand it now). I think we barely got to final level, but haven't found the final boss, it was just once, and my friend gave up, because it was too difficult to get there (we even leave console on pause at night sometimes).
<br />
<br />So, everyone gave up, and I had no cart (don't remember what happened to it, I think it completely broke after all), and no console, but still was obessed with the game, thinking about it all the time, and wondering how it ends. One night I had a dream I still remember, where I finally beat the game, and see the final cut. It was something about Jason (me?) walking on clouds.
<br />
<br />Years after this I've got console and another cart with the game, still the japanese version, but not glitchy, and actually beat it. Barely can remember how this happened. Afterwards I'm sure I beat both japanese and american versions on emulators, maybe even few times, but don't really remember this either.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I frequently have dreams about variations of real NES games that do not exist. Like Zelda II with a different world map, or Zelda 1 with a completely different map.
<br />
<br />Some of the dreams are of games that are kinda similar to existing games. There is an RPG that I dream of that looks like a cross between Dragon Warrior and Ultima: Warriors of Destiny (horrible game BTW, try it on PC, much better).
<br />
<br />And then there's the bat-shit-insane Zeldroidvania game I keep dreaming about. Those dreams are what I am basing my current project on, but with some of the insanity removed <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />The strange thing is, every time I have one of these dreams about a particular game the games are the same as the last time I dreamed of them. My dreams are kinda weird like that. Every time I revisit the same theme in one of my dreams the details are usually exactly the same as the last time I dreamed of them.

<br />I see what you're talking about. However I'm not too sure : When you deam you're like in another dimention, so like the real world it has it's own past and future. I guess you can dream about something, and in the dream you feel like the thing has always existed and that you knew it from a long time, but in fact it might be the first time you dream about it, you just don't feel it that way.
<br />
<br />(This make it even harder to come back to the real world when waking up and you're like WTF happened ?)
<br />
<br />I might be wrong though.

<br />
<br />I have had that dream a couple times, 2 or 3 times, since he's said that. It sucks, because I dream of finding the grail and waking up and knowing it's just a dream. But I do like the rush I get when I see the game in my dream.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />

<br />
<br />This was before I had even heard of Somari! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />
<br />
<br />Biggest difference was that the one in my dream was by Sega &amp; it was 2 players alternating.

<br />It was several years ago, when I was about 10 years old.
<br />I was furious because I just couldn't beat Go! Dizzy Go!.
<br />One day I really was frustrated and go to sleep.
<br />I dreamt about some kind of "Go! Dizzy Go! 2" where you could play as Zaks and some green(blue?)-colored dizzy(Normally, it's impossible).I can't remember it much.
<br />Lately(about half year ago...) I decided to make a hack where you can play as zaks and doppelanger* xD(After I finish decoding GO Dizzy Go code completly.)
<br />
<br />*doppelganger is a green-colored enemy that appeared in "Dizzy:Prince Of the Yolkfolk"...but I never played POY before that dream!
