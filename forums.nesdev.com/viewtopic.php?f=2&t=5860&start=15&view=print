		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, it appears to be working great now! The compressor has been updated (download from the <a href="http://membler-industries.com/tokumaru/tokumaru_tile_compression.7z" class="postlink">same location</a> as before), and now it compresses better than Codemasters' compressor did (at least for the few tilesets I tried).
<br />
<br />I did something tepples suggested me a few days ago: messing with the lengths of the blocks gradually, making them longer or shorter, merging blocks, things like that, and it worked great. After adjusting all the lengths a few times (the program only stops when the compression ratio stops improving), a pretty decent compression ratio is achieved. Compare it against other compressors/formats and draw your own conclusions.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure if the compression ratio can be improved any further, but my guess is it can. I believe this is beyond my level of intelligence though, so I probably won't try it. I'm just glad I was able to make it slightly better than the scheme I was basing myself on.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I hope that there are no bugs, but if you find anything just let me know. I hope this is useful for you guys that need some extra CHR compression. I'll probably use it in my projects from now own too.

<br />Yeah, that's expected, since LZMA is designed to work on arbitrary data and doesn't know the input consists of several bitmaps with dimensions of 8x8 pixels and color depth of 2 bpp.
<br />
<br />The Codemasters codec is the best one I've seen used in NES games (I didn't check every single game, obviously). It seems that most other developers favored simplicity and settled for more modest compression ratios. I admire Codemasters for going this far in order to make better use of the ROM space they had. You know, this was not their first compression scheme, in older games they used a simpler one, and I think it's admirable that they continued to research better methods instead of sitting on their asses and just using what they already had.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I'm not sure where to go from here. I'm more than satisfied with the compression ratio now, and I doubt I can improve it any further. I guess I'll try to make the decoder faster, even though I don't think speed is a big issue here... 2 seconds (I didn't time it, I'm just guessing) isn't such a long time to wait for the tiles to load. I don't want to sacrifice space though, so I'll only consider making it faster if I can do it without making it larger.

<br />Two seconds to load 8 KiB? Four tiles a frame? Sounds like a Micronics game. Has anyone else watched the pattern tables during Ikari Warriors' opening sequence? Perhaps part of favoring simplicity comes from favoring speed.

<br />
<br />After doing a bit of logging I found this to be my problem:
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It is possible to repeat the first row of the first tile of a block, and a row filled with color 0 is used in this case.<br /></div>
<br />
<br />I'm going to go out on limb here and say either:
<br />
<br />- That's wrong
<br />or
<br />- That's not how smb.bin was encoded
<br />
<br />The 4th tile in smb.bin starts a new block, and the first 4 rows of the 4th tilee are repeat rows.  But if you look at SMB.chr the top 4 rows of the 4th tile are not zero filled.
<br />
<br />Of course it could be that I'm misinterpretting.
<br />
<br />Here's my ugly log that shows how I'm decoding.  My apologies for the crudeness.  Apparently I can't copy/paste from the terminal and photobucket seems to have blurred my png for some retarded reason:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y282/Dischster/beelog.png">http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y282/D ... beelog.png</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />The row 6 and 7 at the top are the last 2 rows of the 3rd tile (they are decoded correctly)
<br />
<br />Following that is the 4th tile.  As you can see, after defining the tables, it opens with '1111' which is 4 zero'd rows.
<br />
<br />
<br />Can you shed some light on this, tokumaru?  I must be doing something wrong, right?
<br />
<br />I'll upload my source if you want to peek, although it's pretty ugly.

Well, if you switch to the new version the above is what you should get (there's a block starting at the 4th tile too, it just appears to have a different length).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Following that is the 4th tile.  As you can see, after defining the tables, it opens with '1111' which is 4 zero'd rows.</div>
<br />From your log it seems that you are decoding the tables wrong, which would completely screw the meaning of future bits. It seems to me that you are not reading a color from the file in case mode 3 is selected. You might have assumed a color is not necessary because it's obvious what the 3 colors are, but you do need to be given a color so that you know which of the 3 possibilities is the most frequent one, because it gets a shorter code than the others.
<br />
<br />In mode 3, when pixels are drawn, the first possibility is given code 0, and the remaining two get codes 10 and 11. We want to make sure the shortest code goes to the most common color. The result wouldn't be as compact if we simply used the 3 possibilities in the same order every time.
<br />
<br />Is that the problem? I'm almost certain it is, because I just checked and the first block never uses mode 3, which must be why you are getting it right.
<br />
<br />EDIT: In case it isn't clear, the building of the tables works like this:
<br />
<br /><strong>mode 0:</strong>
<br />  .no color is specified;
<br />
<br /><strong>mode 1:</strong>
<br />  .the specified color goes to table B;
<br />
<br /><strong>mode 2:</strong>
<br />  .the specified color isn't stored in any tables;
<br />  .the first color that isn't the specified color or the current one goes to table B;
<br />  .the second color that isn't the specified color or the current one goes to table C;
<br />
<br /><strong>mode 3:</strong>
<br />  .the specified color goes to table B;
<br />  .the first color that isn't the specified color or the current one goes to table C;
<br />  .the second color that isn't the specified color or the current one goes to table D;
<br />
<br />The only case where a color isn't specified is in mode 0.

Just run the ROM yourself with FCEUXD's tile viewer open and you can have an idea of how long it takes to decode the first half of SMB's tileset (it's about as long as it takes for them to be displayed, although some of the time is spent setting up the name and attribute tables and other kinds of initialization).

<br />I don't think speed is that important in this case. 1 or 2 seconds isn't enough time for a player to wonder if the game is still running, it's the standard time of a black screen between a fade out and a fade in, not a big deal.
<br />
<br />I could probably make the decoder much faster if I read bits using inlined code rather than a subroutine (think about it: 12 cycles of jsr/rts for every bit adds up to almost 17 frames in a 5KB file). I could also code different sections for each mode rather than check the mode a few times to make decisions. However, that would at least double the size of the decoder, and I don't want it's size to be a big overhead.
<br />
<br />Also, in many cases simplicity doesn't represent speed. There are many cases where the straightforward/simple solution is slow, and you have to think of tricks to make it all faster.

<br />Which means the map decoder has to run that much faster if it caches much of the decompressed map in RAM.

<br />
<br />Also, Map decoders, when realistically complex, should be able to do their job much faster than a tile decoder, seeing as they have to generate around 1KB of data, not 8KB.
<br />
<br />In my game at least, I plan on decoding the tiles for a level while a black screen is displayed, but once that's done I'll display a title card for the level and draw the first screen column by column like when inside the game, so the time it takes to do it will not even count as "black screen time", there will be something to look at and music playing so it will not look frozen.
<br />
<br />I don't remember anyone bitching at load times in NES games, not even  about Ikari Warriors.

<br />I can accept four or five tiles per frame, as long as it can decompress to a transfer buffer in RAM (which I've been putting at $0100-$019F lately) so that I can 1. show a title card while stuff loads (even if only "WORLD 1-1" or "MARIO START!") and 2. swap tilesets within a level. Otherwise, I might have to rethink the design.

<br />So you took out the first block's "load tables" bit. Have you looked into the frequency distribution of the block lengths? I guess I will when I get a chance.
