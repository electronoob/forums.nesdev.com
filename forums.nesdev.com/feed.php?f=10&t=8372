Simple. As the 1st console in the world equipped with a CD-ROM XA simply wasn't available, also while it did have an ADPCM channel it's just a single mono channel and normally not meant to reproduce audio in high enough sample rate used for streamed music. Furthermore, the channel was already used in voices and data seeks on the 1X drive probably won't work well for "real-time streaming" events. Remember, the PCE was a console released in the late late 80's.<br /><br />Even for the PS1, a number of games (especially arcade conversions of fighting games) had animation cut to ensure smooth gameplay.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4653">Gilbert</a> — Mon Dec 12, 2011 6:03 am</p><hr />

Memory is also the reason why in the PCE Arcade Card CD version of World Heroes II, DIO cannot transform to every arbitrary character. If data are to be loaded from the CD during a match the result would be horrible. Not only that there'll be a (long) pause, the BGM will also be cut due to it being CD audio and drives bitd simply cannot play CD audio and access data from the disc at the same time (with rare exceptions such as the obsolete CD-Gs).<br /><br />Even the Neo Geo CD couldn't get away from this fate. Later AES/MVS games are so large that the RAM in the CD unit isn't enough to hold the stuff for a single level. A number of newer games have animations cut, such as the Metal Slug games (I think the PlayStation versions have annoying in-level loadings instead) and in the case of Art of Fighting 3, instead of sacrificing the animation frames, they shrunk all the sprites in the game.<br /><br />For cart games, I also remember the Mega Drive version of Strider Hiryu has some small pauses in-between levels. I think the game is possibly loading more level data to RAM and/or uploading more graphics data to VRAM (the PCE Arcade Card CD version isn't half as good in this case either).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4653">Gilbert</a> — Sun Dec 11, 2011 6:40 pm</p><hr />

The Down+B morphs of Sheik and Pokemon Trainer in Super Smash Bros. Brawl and opponent spawning during event matches take so long for the same reason. With more than two players, the action can't pause, so they load a character's textures and sound bank in the background. They could have gone with lower detail models and fit it all into the Wii's memory (64 MB RAM, 24 MB VRAM), as they did for the N64 version of Smash Bros. (16 MB ROM, 4 MB RAM), but players demanded more detail.<br /><br />A lot of Super NES games freeze while loading sound. Compare the level transitions between Super NES and Genesis in multiplatform titles like Zoop or Pinocchio. Trying to work around this by streaming stuff to the SPC all the time results in gameplay slowdowns, as seen in The Lord of the Rings.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Dec 11, 2011 10:21 am</p><hr />

So I still believe it's true, there are things you can do with a large ROM that are just not possible with smaller RAM.  For one example, I remember reading about a port of Mortal Kombat for Sega CD includes gameplay-ruining pauses so it can load data off the CD.  I just looked up info on it and apparently that was a problem on the Playstation and other versions also, whenever Shang Tsung morphed into other characters or even for some moves.  Yet the SNES port handles it all just fine, because the cart included enough memory.  So yeah, I'd say the SNES can sometimes have more memory than Playstation.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Dec 11, 2011 3:25 am</p><hr />

Following the same reasoning, you'd say the SNES has more memory than the Playstation, as the latter SNES carts were often 4MB but the Playstation only have 2MB of system RAM.<br /><br />The reality is more complex.<br />To compare what is comparable, let's compare the FDS to regular cartridges. The FDS has 34kb of RAM while a cartridge hooked up to a NES has only (natively) 2kb if no SRAM is present on the cart. The FDS is not supperior as it can only "see" small parts of the discs loaded in memory at once - while a cartridge can acess any data anytime.<br /><br />However in a typical game you only access one music at a time, one level at a time, one character set at a time etc... So the real difference is in loading times.<br /><br />The C64 definitely has less graphics possibilities than the NES through - and only have 3 sound channels - even if they feature much more than the NES' channels.<br /><br />Another thing to take into consideration is that VRAM on the C64 is just part of its RAM - so all the part you use for storing graphics and sprites is taken and can't be used for anything else. This is also why the C64's CPU is so slow - because the RAM access are interleaved between the video chip and the 6510 - so both have to run two times slower than the RAM's speed which is pretty terrible.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Dec 10, 2011 2:25 pm</p><hr />

I suppose when you compare the NES to a computer like the C64, for the 'average' NES game you can safely say the NES has more memory than the C64.  The memory just happens to be read-only.  It's not just a matter of there being 'no loading times', but there is simply stuff one can do with 512kB of memory that can't be done in 64kB, whether it's ROM or RAM.<br /><br />Check out this port of Prince of Persia to C64 (released a couple months ago) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBs5-WOtIpc" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBs5-WOtIpc</a><br />It uses a ROM cartridge.  I'm not certain, but I imagine this (with all those animations) would just not be possible without a large memory.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat Dec 10, 2011 1:11 pm</p><hr />
