But then again, if you were to open the console to install it, might as well just cut pin #4 and ground it...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, so please bear with me as I know a little bit about electronics repair (I own and maintain several arcade cabinets) but not much at all about the NES.   I have two systems, one is the original NES I got for Christmas 84 (or 85) and one I just picked up at a yard sale.  The one I've owned my whole life is still pretty bulletproof (need to wiggle the games a bit to make them work but it's not much hassle, and all games eventually play).  The one I picked up at the yard sale I tested out and it had a lot of trouble getting games to play on it.  So, I did some research and found out about the pin4 mod, as well as replacing the 72 pin connector. <br /><br />I ordered  a replacement connector, and while waiting for it to arrive, I disassembled and cleaned the yard sale NES, and performed the pin4 mod by snapping the leg (if this is the problem, I can blame myself for being too lazy to get out the desoldering iron instead).   The new connector arrived, I put it on my shiny clean NES, and fired it up, except... I quite often get a blank gray screen.  Many games boot up perfectly the first time (Maniac Mansion, Metroid to name two), but several games (Kirby's Adventure with perfect contacts) just refuse to boot no matter what I do.  I put KA into the old NES and it boots up fine, first try.<br /><br />So, my understanding of the electronics in this thread is minimal, but does my experience seem to relate to what you're saying about the pin4 mod?  Do I need to replace my CIC chip (or otherwise patch the circuit) to get games like KA to boot again? <br /><br />If you guys think my system helps confirm the theory of the pin#4 mod not always working, is there any data about my system I can provide to help figure it out?<br /><br />Edited to add: My original NES is 100% original, no mods, no replacements, never even been opened (although I probably will replace the 72 pin connector at some point).   The yard sale one I've only had for about a week.

I don't want to potentially derail this thread any further so this will be my last post.  <br /><br />As I said in my first post, many games boot perfectly the first time on the modded NES.  Metroid, Maniac Mansion, and many others come up like magic first try.  The motherboard connectors have been cleaned as part of the modding process.  The 72 pin connector is new.  Most games &quot;just work&quot;.  KA and others, &quot;just do not work&quot;.   All the games that &quot;just do not work&quot; work fine in my stock NES.<br /><br />I believe your knowledge is much greater than mine when it comes to the NES, and I agree that 99% of the time the solution is cleaning.  I also believe you that the grey screen means the game isn't loading, and I believe you when you say it should have nothing to do with the security lockout chip.   However, basic troubleshooting skills tell me that if a game works 100% of the time in a stock system (and has been cleaned etc etc) then the problem isn't the game.  Also they tell me that if many games boot up 100% of the time in the modded system, the system itself is at least basically functional.   So what that tells me is that the first place to look is the differences between the two systems... the obvious answer is that one system has pin#4 on the CIC cut and the other doesn't.  It might not be the culprit, but it's still the first thing to investigate/eliminate.<br /><br />You are probably right, the CIC mod probably has nothing to do with this.  I'll stop posting now.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />the reset button should work if the CIC functions .. can't believe you said otherwise.. the cic is basically (more or less) the reset button..  did you read the whole thread? look at the pinout pin 7 is the reset button.. you already know that though because you circuit is 150% better right?<br /><br />please for the love of god don't flood this thread i answered because I KNOW THAT I KNOW.. its a damaged CIC .. 100% <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />JCIC and Ciclone both can be clocked at 1hz though i haven't tested it with your circuit but it should be safe.. but that's not what this thread is about is it? we already have a bloody debate about it in the other thread i'm sure everyone has seen it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />you don't need to defend yourself its alright i know you didn't read everything in the thread it's getting very long it happens ..  i'm planing on updating the first post with symptoms of both damaged and locked cic's.. and all the other info for people <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />EDIT: check for +5 volts on pin 7 when you hit the reset button only way it's not the CIC
