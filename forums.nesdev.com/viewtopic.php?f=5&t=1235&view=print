<br />I live in the US and I found a nice bookcase at my local Target. However, it is getting a bit crowded. I have about 120 games, but the number is slowly increasing. I'm looking for other (cheap to buy or easy to build) options.

<br />I have a Target, Wal-Mart, Ikea, and other fine retailers all within driving distance - so don't be afraid to share your suggestions.

<br />I started out with a massive load of shoe boxes to store my games.  I never really found anything in a store that would hold all my games (plus I really didnt want to spend money on a shelf) and make it easy to see them.  I just built a storage system (game storage cubical, game shelf, whatever you wanna call it) out of some spare wood to hold them.  Has worked out well for me <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Hahaha! I'm still in the shoe box system. I also store the consoles in boxes, but not always they'll fit in shoe ones.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I saw some hardcore collectors put stuff in large plastic containers (are those tupperware?). It's good 'cause they're easy to move, unlike bookcases and shelves. You could put them under the bed, on top of the closet, places like that.
<br />
<br />But if you got the space you may prefer something more "displayable". I prefer to keep the stuff safe, away from the sun or anything that could damage the material, regardless of how much free space I have.

I don't have very many NES games, I have about 55 or so. Some of them are clones, like I have 2 copies of Double Dragon 3 for some reason. My brothers got the NES so dirty, so it never worked, and we didn't have very many games. Then we only had like 15 or so, and we stored them on a small shelf. We actually rented alot of games from our local grocery store (weird huh?). I'm actually going to get a japanese cabinet with glass doors all around it, and I'm going to store all my NES games in there. Maybe if this thread is still alive by then, I'll post pics.

<br />
<br />Yeah thats pretty much what I was going for.  Rather than having the boxes spread out on the floor I went with the vertical deal so I could see all the titles and not have to crawl around on the floor looking from box to box.

<br />
<br />Now I have them stored in some cheap plastic chest of drawers that I found in the basement of my apartment building (someone left it behind when they moved out). They are still in order, so I can grab what I want quickly - but now they are safely out of the way of the light, and the cats!

Ther is a box sitting on top of my scanner with some random stuff(I think theres at least two there) Theres a folded blankedt in the top of my closet theres a few on top of that. I think theres a couple in my brotheres dresser, one or two sitting somewhere in the plie of trash under my desk. Theres a copy of Maniac Mansion keeping my kitchen table from wobbleing. I use one to one of the many copys of Super mario 1 to hold open one of my windows. (another one of my windows is held open by my halo 1 case) My wife keeps a copy of metroid 1 in a cart sleeve under her side of the bed, I think thers one in the attic, there is one in one of the light fixtures to. There is a mass of cables on top of the entertainment center with a few inside of it. I have a big metal box in the garage with like twenty in it. But NES games arent the only things i use utilitarianly around the house. I use 10 cent DVD cases all over the place to. And my XBOX sits on its side in a window to keep it open, the NES has some books stacked on top of it, my SNES is buried somewhere in the yard, I use the N64 as a witght to keep the gamecupe from falling off the desk. My PS2 is in 100000 picses all ofer the place as well. Over all I'd say the games I have are: Metroid 1, Super mario 1-3, Skate or die 1-2, Duck hunt, Final Fantisy 1-3, and a number of carts I made myself. Oo oo I thin ktheres one under the house to but I'm not going down there.
