<br />The NTSC frame:

<br />
<br />Of course the frame is circular -- so you can start it anywhere (if you start with VBlank, it will end with the idle scanline -- if you start with rendering, it'll end with the pre-render, etc)

Have you tried nestest.nes?  Perhaps there's a weird CPU bug in your emu causing this to happen in these test ROMs.<br /><br />Maybe it's not that you're not setting the flag, but rather you're clearing it too soon.  From a quick glance at the source, this test ROM seems to just wait a moderately long time for the flag to set, then checks it once (as opposed to most commercial games which poll it constantly).  Perhaps your emu is setting it and clearing it before the ROM checks it?  If you're automatically clearing the flag at any time other than a $2002 read, try removing that and see if you get past that error -- that'll give you a better idea of what might be causing the problem (note:  this is not a solution!  You <em>are</em> supposed to automatically clear the flag at a certain time -- I'm only recommending this for diagnostic purposes)<br /><br />But it's really hard for me to speculate what the problem could be.  The best way to go about solving this problem would be to dump a trace log of your emu running this log and have it display information relevant to the problem (timestamps, $2002 status, etc).  This will help you see where the ROM is going wrong, and will give you a better idea of what it's expecting (so you can know what needs to be done to fix the problem).<br /><br />Believe me, if you put a tracer in your emu, it's an unbelievably valuable debugging tool.  This won't be the last time you'll have a use for it.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">When does the test expects this bit? I mean, on which scanline does it run the test (if everything should work properly of course)? Scanline 241 when the vblank occurs?</div>
<br />
<br />EDIT -- oh whoops, I totally misunderstood what you were asking before
<br />
<br />*checks*
<br />
<br />edit again:
<br />
<br />from the source:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jsr&nbsp; &nbsp;wait_vbl<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ldy&nbsp; &nbsp;#25&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; 29800 delay<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lda&nbsp; &nbsp;#237&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jsr&nbsp; &nbsp;delay_ya8<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lda&nbsp; &nbsp;#2;&#41; VBL flag isn't being set<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lda&nbsp; &nbsp;$2002<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and&nbsp; &nbsp;#$80<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jsr&nbsp; &nbsp;error_if_eq<br /></div>
<br />
<br />So the test is:
<br />
<br />- waiting for VBlank (probably by polling $2002?  oddly I couldn't find a 'wait_vbl' label in the source anywhere)
<br />- doing nothing for about 29800 CPU cycles (roughly 1 frame)
<br />- checking VBlank flag once and erroring if it's not set
<br />
<br />
<br />A full NTSC frame is roughly 29780.667 CPU cycles:
<br />
<br />341 PPU cycles per scanline
<br /> * 262 scanlines per frame
<br /> = 89342 PPU cycles per frame
<br /> / 3 PPU cycles per CPU cycle
<br /> = 29780.667
<br />
<br />so if the ROM is waiting 29800 cycles, it is checking the flag roughly 20 cycles into VBlank (so almost a fourth of the way through the very first scanline of VBlank)

<br />So for PAL NES, the cycle stoichiometry becomes the following:

<br />= 106392 PPU cycles per frame
<br />/ 3.2 PPU cycles per CPU cycle

<br />

<br />
<br />Minor correction - PAL is 312 scanlines per frame, not 322. This works out to 33247.5 CPU cycles per frame.

<br />My CPU core passes the nestest.nes actually so that's not the problem.
<br />If I am not mistaken, isn't bit 7 of $2002 cleared when read? Wonder if this might cause the problem.. Have to do further investigation obviously... 
<br />
<br />I have myself to blame but I don't have any kind of tracer in my emulator. The emulator is overriding the OS (more or less) for better performance (Remember I code this thing on a 50Mhz Amiga <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />) and implementing tracers/Debuggers in 68000 assembler wasnt to tempting back then when I started it. But it would have been a good idea. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />yes -- although I don't think that omission that would cause this paticular test to fail.
<br />
<br />I would wager your frame is too long and the test ROM is checking the VBlank flag before your emu has set it.  Either that or a few of your instructions are too short (don't take enough CPU cycles) and so blargg's timed code isn't waiting as long as it thinks it is.
<br />
<br />Or -- your frame could be way too short and the vblank flag is being cleared before the test ROM reads it -- although since the test ROM checks it near the start of VBlank, your emu would have to have the frame 19 scanlines too short for it to fail -- whereas it would only need it to be 1 scanline too long for it to fail.
<br />
<br />
<br />If you don't feel like (or can't) code a full tracer -- at least try and make it so you can dump quick information to a .txt file at key times (like say, at $2002 reads).  This will let you know when the ROM is reading $2002, when in the frame it's reading it, and what value it's getting when it reads it.

<br />
<br />2 cycles if the branch is not taken
<br />3 cycles if the branch is taken
<br />4 cycles if the branch is taken and it crosses a page boundary
<br />
<br />of course for timed loops -- most of the time the branch will be taken, so I suppose defaulting to 3 cycles would be better than defaulting to 2.
