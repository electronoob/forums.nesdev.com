I have been searching for days on how to use these things, but can't find anything. Can anyone here point me to some tutorials or just general information on this? It looks like quite a powerful tool.
<br />
<br />Also, some 6502 ABSOLUTE BEGINNER tutorials (specifically for the NES) would be helpful. All the tutorials that I've read seem to assume you know everything about how a computer/NES works... I've been working with C/C++ for a while and it's been hard to grasp the concepts (e.g. I just learned what data registers were yesterday).

<br />The assembler in NESICIDE 1 isn't one of the mainstream assemblers that people here will help you with.  It was a "roll your own" attempt I made but have since abandoned.
<br />
<br />There aren't any tutorials for NESICIDE 1 but <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nesicideproject/documents" class="postlink">here</a> are various example projects based on ROMs [all of them top notch, if you ask me!] developed by people that frequent this board.

<br />* Old NESICIDE had a pattern drawer, assembly maker (joining 4 patterns) and nametable drawer. The Graphics Bank designer is messy, unconfortable and very difficult for people who don't know a bit of 6502 asm!
<br />
<br />*The same thing with sprites. It also had a rom designer where you chose your mapper, additional VRAM on/off, SaveRAM, Trainer. Also: Ifound no support for TRAINER banks. To be honest, NESICIDE1 was like making PRG,CHR,draw,code,compile,yay! NESICIDE2 is so... "naked". 
<br />
<br />We know you are a good programmer, cpow, we saw it on NESICIDE1, but NESICIDE2 is screwed up.

<br />Well for one, it actually works(I'm using linux). I can't find any downloads for the source or anything for v2, and there are no instructions on how to build it from the git repository. I also like the layout and the low-level feel of v1. Not to mention the built-in pallete/sprite editor. As for those demos/examples, none of them worked with a windows build of v2 running under WINE, and they won't open in v1.

<br />
<br />Yes you bring up a good point.  NESICIDE 2 did at one time build in Linux but it has been a long while since I've gone back to Linux.  I only have a VirtualBox Ubuntu to work with...
<br />
<br />I have decided to put energy into the palette/tile editor for NESICIDE 2.
<br />
<br />I don't know about NESICIDE's capabilities over WINE.  I know the examples all work for me.  If you could post specifically what it is that is "not working" I can look into it.
<br />
<br />NESICIDE 2 is not "the continuance of" NESICIDE 1.  They are completely disjoint and incompatible packages.  The project file format of NESICIDE 1 is Windows-binary-specific.  The project file format of NESICIDE 2 is XML.
<br />
<br />Thanks for the feedback!

I'm not sure what you mean by "messy".  The Graphics Bank designer is merely a mechanism to organize the binary files (or, once completed, tiles from the tile designer) into an 8K CHR.  You don't need to know 6502 assembly to use the Graphics Bank.  <br /><div class="quotetitle">IvanDSM wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">*The same thing with sprites.

<br />TRAINER banks are never or very rarely used.  I'm glad you had a simple experience with NESICIDE 1.  I hope to bring enough of its functionality into NESICIDE 2 so the experience can be replicated there.
