UNROM could support 4 Mbytes of PRG, just by using an 8-bit latch instead of the 4-bit latch/counter Nintendo always used.  UNROM logic is also nice because you can easily swap a chip to reverse the banking logic $8000-$BFFF fixed, $C000-$FFFF switchable).  I used that setup for my Chipography NSF, because of the many DPCM samples.<br /><br />With all that space, I'd conclude that better compression is even more useful, because you can fit even more stuff in it!!<br /><br />I could really use some better CHR compression about now, as I'm using RLE on Garage Cart #2.   So tokumaru, or anyone else that has an experimental NES CHR compression scheme, it'd be nice to have on-board the project.

I used to not think much of Dictionary compression, then I saw what it did for Zelda oracle of ages.  Dictionary compression can be some nice stuff, especially when you have tons of ROM, and constrained RAM.  You can do random access with no history, as long as you have a link to the correct address.  You can get a correct address by creating pointers to arbitrary subdivisions of the data.<br /><br />For example, the Dragon Warrior Games used RLE, which requires no history.  In order to get random access, they used one pointer for each row, then sequentially access within the row.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Wed Jul 08, 2009 5:43 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Dwedit wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Compression doesn't always require a sliding window.  You can still do amazing stuff when constrained.<br /></div><br />As I see it, the big problem is that you usually need random access to data, and reading from the middle of a compressed stream can be hard/slow depending on the type of compression.<br /><br />A way to solve the problem is to break down large amounts of data (such as level maps) into smaller pieces and compress them individually. This will work well if you only need access to small parts of the whole thing at a time. You'd still need some sort of RAM buffer though, even if it wasn't very large.<br /><br />Another option is to use compression schemes that result in data of constant sizes, much like how metatiles are used to compress tiles. That allows you to still have random access to the data because everything is at a predictable location.<br /><br />I think that mapper-less games can only go so far. Games like SMB managed to have quite a few levels using so little ROM because it's level format was so compact, but that also resulted in somewhat dull-looking levels.<br /><br />Game logic doesn't take that much space, it's the data that uses most of it. Levels in particular need a great deal of memory, because of their physical structure and because of the objects that populate them. So in order to have a large game (long and numerous levels) in a small cart, the most obvious thing to sacrifice is level detail.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Jul 08, 2009 5:03 pm</p><hr />

It's barely enough to hold all the variables, arrays and such of complex games, there is really no room for decompressed code/data. So we are limited to simple compression schemes that can be decompressed on the fly as the data is read from the ROM, which usually results in modest compression ratios, but is still better than no compression.<br /><br />I have nothing against mappers in general, but I became a supporter of the simpler mappers, the ones that use discrete logic. None of them have good CHR bankswitching capabilities, so I became a CHR-RAM supporter too, and good CHR compression (like this one from Codemasters) makes all the difference.<br /><br />I like UNROM and UOROM a lot, because their PRG bankswitching is as simple as it gets, and real carts can be built fairly easily. I find WRAM too complicated to add to a cart, so I tend to avoid it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Jul 08, 2009 11:36 am</p><hr />

Yeah, so long as you had enough RAM to decompress it to. That would probably require WRAM if you wanted to not greatly reduce the amount of RAM available for the program to use, which would require a mapper or a modification to NROM. But that's an interesting concept, though I suspect there are a lot of cons involved in doing something like that. But with code, there are a lot more patterns than with graphical data, or so I'd assume. LDA/STA combos make up a HUGE chunk of my code.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Wed Jul 08, 2009 10:24 am</p><hr />
