(The NES did not really have any kind of official SDK, there wasn't a need.)<br /><br />2. All characters, art, music, etc. is original and not derivative of someone else's intellectual property.<br /><br />2. As far as the hardware, anything to do with the NES that was patented has already expired. Not sure about the PSX, thought it might be old enough too now?<br /><br />Note that patent expiration applies mainly to hardware devices. Software (including SDKs) is usually covered under copyright, not patent, so it doesn't expire nearly so quickly.

If you own a Net Yaroze and are covered by that agreement, then yes, if not, then technically no (unless it has some kind of permissive public licensing).<br /><br />Practically speaking I doubt anyone would come after you for Net Yaroze or even using pirated official SDKs. I don't think you really have much to worry about, even if you were illegally using their code. This is mostly an academic discussion, IMO.<br /><br />I think it's far more likely that you'd get nailed for using the Roll character, if anything, but I doubt even that would come up.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">First off, how would they know you're using it if you were</div><br />Compiled libraries like an SDK provides are relatively easy to search for in the executable binary. Even if it's not a library, figuring out if someone is using your code is not really that difficult a problem if you have access to the executable.<br /><br />The difficult problem is really just knowing which software to look at. It's probably not worth anybody's time to be checking PSX homebrew binaries and analyzing them to see if they're using your code. Usually when it's found, it's because of some external tip-off. Maybe somebody who knows tells you, or maybe you find an old forum post discussing it, or maybe you're just really familiar with how your code worked and you see some quirk of behaviour when you're playing the game and you know your code must be in there.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You could get in trouble for copyright infringement if you use the Yaroze libraries. If you want to be totally safe legally you would need to use open source libraries or ones developed by yourself. Using the official SDK and libraries could get you in trouble. However it's entirely possible you could get away with it.<br /><br />But when you talk about a freeware game as you have now with Roll Boss Rush, it's very different. Using the official SDK isn't likely to get you in trouble. There are lots of freeware/homebrew things out there that either use copyrighted SDKs or characters/artwork that belong to someone else. The worst that might happen is a cease and desist letter.
