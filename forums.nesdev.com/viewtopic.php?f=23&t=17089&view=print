	</div><br />It showed a message telling it was designed to be played on NTSC systems.<br />So, I played a little with the switches and it booted fine with all of them off.<br />Interestingly it didn't boot alone even with a game genie.<br />I quickly opened it to see what's inside and I only could find an epoxy blob, the 4 switchs and some parts marked as RPx, wich I suppose are some resistors associated on a bar.<br /><br />I also removed the FRAM and the logic circuits around it, routed the ROM /CE to the 74HC139 pin 1 and got the same results.<br />Is there anything I can try to do to make it boot alone?<br />It's also missing all the capacitors, except the electrolytic one.<br />What capacitors are these? I think they're decoupling capacitors, but I didn't find an clear enough image to see its values, would they be 100nF (104) ones?<br />Also, it's not saving, I fount that specific FRAM chip (FM1208S) to be expensive, maybe I could use an SRAM on its place.<br /><br />Just in case someone is interested, here is some board p0rn:<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

Most of the functionality of the logic revolves around changing between sonic 3 mode as an individual cart, and sonic &amp; knuckles + sonic 3.  That gets controlled by B27 #RESET.  the S&amp;K grounds that pin permanently for the S3 cart.  Could be some errors with my schematic.  I only beeped out the interesting parts with a DMM.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This reminds me of my own problems with my Sonic 3 cartridge I've had since 1994. It never saved games, but I didn't consider this a major issue as a kid. Only recently I got curious about it again and decided to check what could be the problem, and to my surprise, the FRAM appeared to have been intentionally disabled, as one of the traces leading to it was cut.<br /><br />I have no idea why anyone would do that, specially considering this was an original TecToy cartridge, bought sealed from a respectable store.<br /><br />I haven't tried to restore that trace yet, but I guess it would be cool if my cartridge was finally able to save.

		<br />
	</div><br />The game only resets after the 3rd reset press.<br /><br />The MegaKey I have is a bit different.<br />It only has an epoxy blob, 4 switchs and 3 parts marked as RP1 to RP3.<br />All the 4 switches have one pin plugged to GND, the other pin goes for the blob.<br />More or les like this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">A&nbsp; B&nbsp; C&nbsp; D<br />|&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; |<br />o&nbsp; o&nbsp; o&nbsp; o<br />&nbsp;/&nbsp; /&nbsp; /&nbsp; /<br />&nbsp;|__|__|__|__GND<br /></div><br />I called A, B, C and D the indivitual pins of the epoxy blob the switchs connects to.<br /><br />By the markings and format of the other parts, I suppose they're resistor bars. (is this name correct?)<br />They're connected like this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">RP1 = 7A102J (near the upper cart connector)<br />+ | A17 | A16 | A15 | A14 | A13 | A12 &lt;-Connector pins<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />RP2 = SLIP A5 102J (near the console connector)<br />+ | A24 | B25 | B24 | B23 | B22 &lt;-Connector pins<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />RP3 = A102G (near the console connector)<br />GND | A20 | A22 | A19 | B22 &lt;-Connector pins<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /></div><br />Would these resistor bars be responsible for the game working with the adapter?<br /><br />Maybe it's a problem with the MaskROM, but to confirm this I would need to dump it.<br />I have found some options, including one that uses a <a href="https://www.retrodev.com/transfer.html" class="postlink">SegaCD</a> to dump the game.<br />But unfortunatelly I don't own a SegaCD, and I need to take a better look before trying to build any of the other options.<br />If someone can please do a similar program that can do that without a SegaCD, I'll be very thankfull. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> <br /><a href="http://www.paulsprojects.net/megareader/megareader.html" class="postlink">This one</a> particullary seems to be a good option to me.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Use diode test and measure each IO against VCC and GND, they should all show very similar results. If one differs from the rest then that pin may be fucked. I revived a SoR2 cart by placing a pullup resistor on a pin that didn't match the others.<br /><br />Sonic 3 will boot without any of its companion hardware present provided you wire !CE and !OE pins to the ROM properly. If this most bare config doesn't work then it narrows the problem down to PCB and ROM. If all traces reach the ROM from cart edge you have a bad ROM at your hand. The PCB uses crappy glue vias that may fail in some way.

That was it!<br />Thank you so much TmEE!<br />I tried the diode test with the - probe on vcc and got about 20 different readings.<br />But with the inverse (+ probe on gnd), I got only one different reading. <br />I soldered a 1K pull down and bang! It worked alone!<br />Thanks again! <br /><br />I forgot to ask about the save RAM, does the game really use 1kb to save?<br />If so, I can plug it's A8 pin to vcv and it should work.<br />But maybe I should install a 16Kb SRAM with a simple battery circuit.<br />The SRAM would make a future fix / maintenance easier...<br />But there's the space problem...<br />What do you guys think?
