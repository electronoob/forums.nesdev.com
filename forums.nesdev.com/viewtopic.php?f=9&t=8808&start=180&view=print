The R&amp;D to adapt a modern DAC does not seem trivial and I'm afraid it would really add to feature creep. Not that it's unobtainable, it just looks like a minefield of unknown issues to overcome when there is already a growing todo list <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> Then again, new old stock or working pulls of the YMF262 (OPL3) are also about the same cost as the YM3812 on ebay, and <em>its</em> DAC looks to be usually cheaper than the OPL3.</div>This combo does seem like a better solution compared to the OPL2 and YM3014 depending on goals.

If the OPL3 is an option on the table, for prototyping I might recommend the MBFM board. It's available through SmashTV's shop at $8. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.midibox-shop.com/buy.html">http://www.midibox-shop.com/buy.html</a><!-- m --><br />It's far too large to be viable within an NES cart but for proof of concept and dev it could help? <br /> If you do develop a OPL3 shield, going all SMT would shrink it quite a bit even though that would complicate DIY building. I've had good results hand soldering down to 0805 parts if the layout isn't too tight, so I would be up for a bare board. But I'm sure many would need/like a prebuilt option. Which of course leads back to the demand of an inventory of parts and sourcing issues.  <br /> Just gotta say the interest and support in this effort is really great from everyone! Even the OPLL expansion would be of major interest to a number of chiptune musicians; an OPL2/3 or OPN2 board might cause riots in the streets! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br />Yogi

It should have expired in 2007 regardless. </div><br /><br />Well good news and bad news. <br />First: I'm using HCT74s, R=1M, C=22pF<br />The first tests I've run are on solderless proto boards so there is a lot of stray C, but with a 2MHz xtal the Osc side does start up fine. The only way I can couple to the  /2 FF is by running the /Q output through a HCT14 inverter gate. Also, with the osc running I can see the 2MHz signal at the /Q - Xtal node but not at the Q output; I thought that this should  be oscillating also, due to the /Q-Reset oscillations, strange. <br />  If I directly couple the output to the CP input of the /2 stage, as per the patent doc, I see the 2MHz signal at it's outputs with no division. Inputting a higher drive level signal (my 3.58MHz HCT14 osc) to the divider works fine.<br /> Moving on to a 8MHz and then a 16MHz xtal worked as per above (had to set up a second HCT 74 as a /4 prescaler; my DMM F counter tops out at 4MHz.) So it seems to work in this 2chip solution but would be nice to have only 1 chip.<br /> So I will be trying to adjust the feedback R values to get better drive out of the osc and eliminate the HCT 14 gate.<br />Yogi<br />EDIT <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /> YEA! After doing a better search and reading the Patent, I got a little better understanding of the operation. <br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The resistance of R1 and the capacitance of C1 are selected such that the time constant R1C1 is much longer than the time for one half cycle of the crystal's resonant frequency. </div><br /> This is somewhat flexible from my tests , the patent circuit ran with a verity of 14 through 16 MHz xtals; using the combo of  C=370pF and R=10M. A NOT gate was <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> needed! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

The original frequency was already just 7kHz, I'm surprised dropping it to 40Hz helped things (as opposed to, say, simply reducing the strength of the bias resistor). Or maybe the extra capacitive load did something. That large of a capacitance should definitely drop the effective frequency of the crystal, though. (How do 22pF and 370pF compare to the parallel parasitic capacitance of the crystal?)<br /><div class="quotetitle">yogi wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">On a side note, I located the Yamaha datasheet for the YM2608 (the parent of the YM2612; the same FM core). the Interesting thing I found is it's nominal Master CLK is 8MHz, so I think Sega just under-clocked it, based on the chosen system clock. So, could use a standard 8 MHz can; but it may be better to maintain compatibility with Sega VGM values?<br /></div>Hm. I wonder. Page 19 of the translated OPNA datasheet shows there's a selectable clock divider of 2,3, or 6 for the FM synth, but I'm not certain what else that changes. After all, the OPNA contains its own DAC, so there's no minimum clock speed to hold a serial bitstream. Anyway, when at a divider of 6 (claimed necessary for behavior above 4MHz), the output sample clock is Mclk/144. (Much like the OPL3's is Mclk/288, or the OPL2's is Mclk/72).<br /><br />Beyonds changing the necessary tuning tables, this will also slightly affect ADSR rates, the timers, and the various free-running LFOs (e.g. &quot;AMS&quot; and &quot;PMS&quot;). Not certain exactly what they're using, since their rates don't seem to be tunable.<br /><br />If we can extrapolate from the OPL3, the FM LFO is fixed at Sclk÷8192, and the AM LFO is fixed at Sclk÷13440. (MESS says these magic numbers are shared with the rest of the OPLx family, but who knows if that's true for the OPNx. Apparently the OPMx family can actually control the LFOs!)<br />----------------------<br /><div class="quotetitle">infiniteneslives wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I²S?  or I²C?

But let's drop this, for the other reasons you laid out.<br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Then again, new old stock or working pulls of the YMF262 (OPL3) are also about the same cost as the YM3812 on ebay, and <em>its</em> DAC [YAC512] looks to be usually cheaper than the OPL3.<br /></div>Gluing these two trains of though together, I thought I'd go ahead and compare the bitstreams we're talking about here:<br /><br />YM3014 (OPL2 DAC) input format<br />- 16 clocks per sample (800kHz)<br />- monaural<br />- falling edge of word clock marks end of word<br />- three idle bit periods per word (650kbit/s)<br />- UNsigned, LITTLE endian, µ-law-like<br /><br />YMF262 (OPL3) output format<br />- 18 clocks per sample (1.79MHz)<br />- two channels interleaved per data line, two data lines, nominally quadraphonic<br />- two word clock lines, falling edge marks end of word<br />- two idle bit periods per word (3.2Mbit/s)<br />- UNsigned, LITTLE endian, PCM<br /><br />I²S stream<br />- any number of clocks per sample, but many receivers require at least 8<br />- two channels interleaved per data line<br />- word clock toggles on bit before end of word<br />- Signed, BIG endian<br />- Many DACs annoyingly require a clock input at 256 times the sample rate.<br /><br /><br />And one even bigger tangent: Since the OPL3 doesn't really support &quot;useful&quot; quadraphonics (each voice can either be mixed or skipped for each output channel), I thought it would be nifty to have controllable VCFs on the DACs' outputs, and downmix that all to mono. But a digitally controlled VCF should really be done all in DSP anyway, so that's really just a pipedream.

The original frequency was already just 7kHz, I'm surprised dropping it to 40Hz helped things (as opposed to, say, simply reducing the strength of the bias resistor). Or maybe the extra capacitive load did something. That large of a capacitance should definitely drop the effective frequency of the crystal, though. (How do 22pF and 370pF compare to the parallel parasitic capacitance of the crystal?) </div><br />My observation with the original RC osc (no Xtal in circuit) measured  @ ~16MHz. In the early stages of my poking, I had tried a 10M with the 22pf value but it had the same problems as stated earlier. After reading the Pat.; just increasing C to ~30pF started it running without the HCT14 gate. <br />  I then began increasing C in the free running circuit till I lowered F to the range of 10MHz. <br />  I haven't seem a major deviation of the Xtal F, in the range of 5-10 KHz lower than the printed F on the Xtal. This could be due , as you point out to the C, or the cal on my DMM or the tolerance of the Xtals I pulled out of my junk box <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Some test Xtals are long ago pulls from radios, and I have no idea on the specs, only the marked Freq and that is down to only 2 decimal places. The only 'known' spec is the 16MHz one, 20pf load cap AT cut, which measured spot on.<br />  Initially, I was assuming this circuit was close to the Pierce but I'm doubting that a little. Of course, may see different performance on a proper layout.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hm. I wonder. Page 19 of the translated OPNA datasheet shows there's a selectable clock divider of 2,3, or 6 for the FM synth, but I'm not certain what else that changes. After all, the OPNA contains its own DAC, so there's no minimum clock speed to hold a serial bitstream. Anyway, when at a divider of 6 (claimed necessary for behavior above 4MHz), the output sample clock is Mclk/144. (Much like the OPL3's is Mclk/288, or the OPL2's is Mclk/72).<br /><br />Beyonds changing the necessary tuning tables, this will also slightly affect ADSR rates, the timers, and the various free-running LFOs (e.g. &quot;AMS&quot; and &quot;PMS&quot;). Not certain exactly what they're using, since their rates don't seem to be tunable.<br /><br />If we can extrapolate from the OPL3, the FM LFO is fixed at Sclk÷8192, and the AM LFO is fixed at Sclk÷13440. (MESS says these magic numbers are shared with the rest of the OPLx family, but who knows if that's true for the OPNx. Apparently the OPMx family can actually control the LFOs!) </div><br /> I've only just started digging into the DS. But Is there a real need to maintain Sega's clk selection? With a 'new' design would there be an advantage to replicating Saga's HW? Would people want to use Saga VGM patches on a NES platform, sounds kind'of cool but IDK.<br />Yogi

It involves some things that can be compensated for (changing F numbers) and accepting the things that can't (5% increase of speed of ADSRs and LFOs). Is 5.8 Hz vs 6.1 Hz something a musician would care about? I'm definitely not the right person to ask.<br /><br />OTOH, if we don't have another more convenient source of clock, using a 15.36÷2 driver vs an 8MHz source isn't so big.<br /><br />One other question: does the YM2612 have the same input clock divider available as the YM2608? If so, would we want to consider running it off M2 instead? It should be equivalent to using a 5.4 MHz crystal. (and a corresponding slowing of the ADSRs and LFOs by 30%)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Last day and a half I've been  testing the HCT74 osc. I've compiled a data set of the tests to try to understand the circuit better. Keep in mind that my test circuit is on solderless breadboard which has a lot of stray C and my DMM only has a range to 4MHz with 4 digit precision. In order to test in the ranges of interest, a prescaler was constructed using a second HCT74.<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<br />
	</div><br /> The testing was done with a range of 3 R values, 4 C Values and 4 Xtal Frequencies. For each Xtal F, the output from the xtal osc was recorded as well as the free-running output for all RC combinations. <br />  Two Xtals, the 11.525NHz and the 14.960MHz, were pulls with unknown specs, the other two, 16MHz and 18.432MHz, are AT cut 20pF load. The former two Xtals had unexpected performance with certain RC combos that leads me to suspect cut and load differences from the later Xtals.  <br />  Some of my conclusions: <br />1 I had a connection issue in the first build of the circuit that caused the strange behavior and the need for a inverter gate buffer. Through out this round of tests, the same R/C/Xtal combos that failed on the initial circuit now work. <br />2  The circuit is fairly forgiving with the RC selection but certain combos misbehave in a unexpected way. Example: The 16MHz Xtal running @ 19MHz with 5M/150pf but measured @ 16MHz with 5M/220pf. I'm sure some of these deviations are due to the mechanical problems with the breadboard as well as errors with my DMM coupling. But it could also indicate a cut/loading issue with the Xtal in some cases.<br />3  The Xtal to Free-running relationship seems to show a lower limit to acceptable RC Frequence. The Xtal Osc fails to lock when the free-running Freq is about 10% below the Xtal Freq. Further analysis is needed to understand the limits of Pat.'s description of the relationship between the RC TC and the Xtal Period.<br />  At this point it should be clear that this circuit is quite capable, compact and could be considered as a replacement of a 'can' osc module if need be.<br />Yogi
