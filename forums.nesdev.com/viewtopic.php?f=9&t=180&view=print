<br />Also, has someone ever made a siple card such as NROM or CNROM on a home-made wrap board witout have any actual NES Game broken ? This would be easy scince they only need EPROMS and 74xxxx chips, but it would be very hard for mecanics stuff.
<br />I guess SNES developement is much easier scince you can insert what you want easily in the console, ever a giant board.

<br />
<br />Rumor has it that the easiest machine for NES development on custom PCBs is either of the toploaders: an AV Famicom or a new smaller NES, if you can find one.

Maybe it's just the size of my adapter, but if a board can't fit in the cart shell, it likely won't fit comfortably in the console either.
<br />
<br />But there's not many reasons to make a one-off homemade NROM or CNROM cart, since they're both already EPROM compatible.  I know sepi made a seperate board a while back that connects to an NROM cart and takes non-volatile SRAMs.  And x|k cut up an edge connector and managed to connect it to a breadboard somehow.

<br />That would be just fun to do and it would allow me to avoid dissolvering old chips (and may to remove the bar), etc...
<br />Nice stuff, but I still don't know how I can remove the metal bar. Witout removing it, I'm only able to insert a card witout the IC sokets and this means a single cartidge is for a single game. Thanks in advance.

They are pretty expensive on Ebay because they are rare.  I've also used the Game Genie extender to let me put EEPROM carts in an unmodified front loader.  The extender is also very hard to come by.  One solution that looks good, but which I haven't tried are the NES to NES adapters available here:

<br />I'm interessted about them, but I'm unsure about wich type of socket you're talking about. Could you show me a picture of them, please ? So I'll look forwad to purchase some, so I'll be able to both replace the PRG/CHR chip on the same card and lend it to friends that have unmodified NES.

<br />
<br />They're also kinda troublesome to install, I might go without them on the rev2 Squeedo.  Since CopyNES can reprogram the flash, the socket shouldn't be needed as much.

Maybe I'll be able to only need to make an hole in the cartidge, but not to remove the metal bar (this would make me things easier)
