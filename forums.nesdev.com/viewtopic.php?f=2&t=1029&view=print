		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi guys.
<br />I was playing with the sprite 0 hit yesterday and noticed something that never came to my mind before. The hit was detected at slightly different times, I think because the CPU can not be perfectly aligned with the PPU and we have to check the hit in software, with CPU code, then it is natural that it varies a little on the timing.
<br />
<br />But is there a way to have the detection take place at the exact same pixel every frame? I tried waiting for the hit still inside the NMI, since it should (in my head) fire at the exact same time every frame. With only constant timed code inside the NMI the hit detection would still vary a little. Am I trying to do something impossible here?
<br />
<br />Thanks for the help.

<br />NMI doesn't break an instruction. It can vary by up to 7 CPU cycles (21 NTSC pixels) from frame to frame.

<br />Yeah, for some reason I thought maybe it would fire off at the same time. But I guess it has to wait any currently running instruction to finish.
<br />
<br />So, there is no way to detect a hit at the same spot in consecutive frames?

<br />The real problem is :
<br />bit $2002
<br />bvc -
<br />
<br />Takes 4 + 3 CPU cycles, so 7 CPU cycles in total. That means the hit can wrap arround 7*3=21 pixels. So in the best case you can time it to be just in HBlank and 21 pixels later in the worst case, but then if leaves you few time to be sure that your PPU writes will end before the begining of the next scanline in the worst case.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That basically works.  But don't put it on the rightmost 8 pixels, it doesn't detect a hit there (just another PPU quirk, I think my 'RTC' demo locks up because of that).
<br />
<br />But there are timing issues, like blargg was showing.  You can't detect a hit at  the exact same time every frame.  The margin of error needs to fit within hblank.
<br />
<br />It's not a good replacement for IRQs though.  Considering that you only get one sprite 0 hit per frame, and also the program has to waste time polling.  Sprite 0 is fine though if you just want one hit really early or late in the frame.

If the whole left 8 bits wouldn't work, my window demo wouldn't work on the real hardware, because it relies on the 254th pixels of the line. And you said youreself it was working.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Sprite 0 is fine though if you just want one hit really early or late in the frame.</div>
<br />Or if you're using a mapper with no IRQ such as CNROM, UNROM, A*ROM and S*ROM.
<br />Also, doing it early cause no problem, because you run your VBlank code, then wait for hit, then end your PPU stuff to begin the calculation part.
<br />Doing it late would cause problems, because you'll probably mean doing VBlank, then calculations, then wait for sprite zero hit. But if your calculation takes too long and overflow, your staut bar at the bottom of the screen could blink. If anyone has better idea, taught me, but I think while it can do the work in most case, it isn't 100% reliable for a finished complex game.

<br />So when VBlank, Sprite zero hit or anything will occur, it will take some time to the CPU to take the PPU change in account. This little time is enough to make the whole thing warp arround a few pixels.

<br />That effectively setup a longer delay of 19 PPU cycles, so the changes will takes 3 pixels later than the previous frame and your code cannot do anything to compensate this.
<br />I don't know exactly which of the four setp of bit $2002 is actually fetching the sprite hit, but the whole loop is 21 PPU cycles long, so an error of 21 pixels in total is possible.

<br />
<br />The fourth (last) clock of BIT abs does the actual memory access. And you can reduce the loop by three PPU clocks by unrolling it (note that you need to use the V flag, not N, since sprite 0 hit is bit 6, not bit 7):

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah, yeah. If you're using an IRQ, your program could just be finishing executing any instruction when IRQ occurs. On the other side, it could just begin to perform lsr $370,X , which is 7 cycles.
<br />So, the error is the same, 7 cycles and 21 pixels. Conclusion : Sprite zero and IRQ have the same tolerance. No one is better than the other in therm of accuracy.
<br />
<br />Edit : Blargg you make your post while I was making one.
<br />I think unrolling loop only reduce the chances to have a larger error, but the error is still here. You'll still need to roll it somewhere :
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">_bigloop<br />bit $2002<br />bvs _hit<br /><br />bit $2002<br />bvs _hit<br /><br />bit $2002<br />bvs _hit<br />.... etc ...<br />bit $2002<br />bvc _bigloop<br /><br />_hit<br />...</div>
<br />If you're unlucky, the hit will occur at the begining of the only bvc instruction, and you'll be done for a 21 pixels delay, even if chances are reducted.
