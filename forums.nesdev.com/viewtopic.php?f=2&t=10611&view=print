Reads of $6000-$6FFF should have returned the value DataFromEeprom as the least significant bit.

The fact that some of these are handwritten is pretty amusing too.<br /><br />In the PPU document there's a diagram showing how to wire a second PPU in slave mode, but I don't see anything explaining how its registers would be mapped... Oh well, it's still nice to see that.

No surprises in the PPU doc, except that the section and bit about sprite overflow is all crossed out.  Does this indicate it doesn't work properly in the earliest PPU, or that it was meant to be removed altogether?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is facinating !<br /><br />Really, even though I of course don't understand most of it, it's really amazing to have these for historical and curiosity purposes. It's especially interesting at the bottom of page 6 where there is a correspondance table between notes and bits code for the length counter. Were Ricoh actually guessing that only 0.2 % of NES games would ever use this feature ? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><br /><br />PS : This should end the polemic about how the registers $2000, $2001, etc... should be named, too.<br /><br />PPS : It's incredible, the infamous &quot;undoccumented footer&quot; lying at $fff0 in some games is finally doccumented in MMC1 page 10.<br />From what I understand with katakanas, it's basically this :<br />$ffe0 - $ffef : &quot;Title area&quot;<br />$fff0 -$fff1 : PRG checksum<br />$fff2 - $fff3 : CHR checksum<br />$fff4 : Casette &quot;mechiri&quot; size<br />$fff5 : Casette type ($04 would mean MMC1 ??), it was previously assumed this byte was for mirroring<br />$fff6 : ?? (assumed to be version)<br />$fff7 : ??<br />$fff8 : Maker code. Here in the example it's $07 which means Enix (surprising to say the least).<br />$fff9 : ?? check<br /><br />I'm kinda sad this header format, so well documented here, went so much disrespected. If all games respected it, there would have been no need for iNES theoretically, and things would have been much better. Oh well.<br /><br />PPPS : So, &quot;MMC&quot; actually means &quot;Multi Memory controller&quot; officially.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The VRC6 documentation seems to only describe what we currently know as the &quot;mirroring control register&quot; at $B003 - apparently, it does quite a lot more than that. From what I can tell, the VRC6 has the ability to map either CHR ROM or CHR RAM (not sure if the chip has separate enables for the two) into the nametables, much like the Namco 163 mapper.

Also on pages 4 and 9 of the MMC1 doc it seems like the &quot;official&quot; way to initialize MMC1 indeed is &quot;INC AddressInROM&quot;, which is not surprising given how many commercial games used this method.<br /><br />I wonder what exactly it says about &quot;PROM&quot; below the init code on page 4?
