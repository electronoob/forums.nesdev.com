		<td><b>MMC3 IRQ Status Bar Question</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm playing around with creating a 4-way scrolling background with a status bar using the MMC3's IRQ.  The IRQ itself is running fine, but for some reason it's drawing pixels from the area about 5 scanlines (not tile-aligned, even though the status bar itself is supposed to be) above where I want it to.  Here's the pertinent code:
<br />
<br />vblank:
<br />	lda #$D8    ; Start the status bar at scaline D8
<br />	sta $C000
<br />	sta $C001
<br />	sta $E001
<br />
<br />        ; Reset the window location
<br />	lda #$20
<br />	sta $2006
<br />	lda #0
<br />	sta $2006
<br />	lda bgX
<br />	sta $2005
<br />	lda bgY
<br />	sec
<br />	sbc #8       ; to account for NTSC
<br />	sta $2005
<br />	rti
<br />
<br />irq:
<br />	lda #$23        ; status bar exists @ $2360 in the nametable
<br />	sta $2006
<br />	lda #$60
<br />	sta $2006
<br />	
<br />	sta $E000
<br />	rti
<br />
<br />I've tried using $2005 to offset it to the right spot, but it doesn't seem to have any effect.  Any ideas on why it's behaving this way and if it's possible to work around it?  Thanks!

<br />
<br />Keep in mind that using a status bar together with 4-way scrolling can be tricky, because the status bar limits how much you can scroll vertically. SMB3 for example has a maximum level height of 2 name tables minus the status bar. Crystalis uses IRQs to "skip" over the status bar, preventing it from being displayed in the middle of the game screen. But the simplest solution is to use single screen mirroring, because you dedicate one of the name tables to the gameplay and the other to the status bar, and they'll never overlap. I don't think the MMC3 supports single screen mirroring though.

The <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES_Mapper_118" class="postlink">wiki page</a> is very poorly written though, full of English mistakes even. It took me forever to understand what "This board rely on the fact that the MMC3 ignores A13 and page name table adress with 1k/2k banks like it does to bankswitch CHR." meant, which I'm guessing means that "the MMC3 doesn't make a distinction between pattern table accesses and name table accesses, so it still selects CHR pages when addresses above $1FFF are read".
<br />
<br />Being limited to 128KB or CHR-ROM is a bad side effect, although you can gain some of the lost space back by duplicating tiles that can be used in both name tables and separating the ones that are always used in the same name table.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I modified the wiki page a bit.

<br />
<br />Here's another method, used by Gargoyle's Quest II, which allows unlimited vertical scrolling: Horizontal mirroring, keep the status bar in the bottom of the second nametable, mirror writes from the first nametable to the second nametable, avoiding overwriting the status bar. Then, you just split the screen on the bottom to show the status bar.
<br />
<br />When your scrolling gets low enough such that the status bar would start scrolling onto screen, the screen split <em>for</em> the status bar will cover it up. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />Anyway, regarding your code, I honestly can't see any reason for it to not work. Theoretically, you resetting $2006 should cause the PPU to drop everything it's doing and start drawing from that exact location. I've definitely split the screen like that before, and it worked, but I don't have the source code for it anymore.
<br />
<br />The only thing I can suggest is to try the method mentioned in Brad Taylor's doc like thefox said. (where you write $2006, then $2005, then $2005 again, then finally $2006 again) I've done this method to have a status bar at the top of the screen (and 4-way scrolling under it), and it worked like a charm.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />sampsonk, I hadn't noticed that your name table is at the bottom of the screen. I'm not sure why your code didn't work, as 2 writes to $2006 should be enough to point to the top of your status bar... theoretically, there is no need for the complex $2006/$2005/$2005/$2006 setup. You should clear the X scroll through $2005 though, or the status bar could shift sideways by up to 7 pixels.
<br />
<br />Maybe this is a timing issue... try adding a few NOPs before the writes to $2006 so see if anything changes. Also make sure that all your writes to $2005 and $2006 are made in pairs, so that the latch that selects between first and second writes isn't left in the wrong state.

<br />SMB3 already writes data to both nametables whenever you scroll horizontally. The only difference with GQ is that you're <em>also</em> writing to the nametables when you scroll vertically. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> The fact that GQ writes mirrored data and SMB3 writes unique data is irrelevent to the PPU; it takes the same amount of writes, regardless.
<br />
<br />Anyway, speaking of SMB3, I'm tracing through it right now to see how it splits the screen, so I'll have an answer in a moment...

<br />Just FYI, Kirby also uses the GQ method of scrolling + status bar. Like tokumaru, I'm not a huge fan of that method, it's too bad Nintendo decided not to include single screen mirroring in MMC3.

<br />SMB3 doesn't HAVE to write two screens worth of tiles when it scrolls horizontally though, this was just a design choice so that it wouldn't have to write any tiles when scrolling vertically. In theory, SMB3 would be making better use of the PPU bandwidth if it updated only 1 screen worth of tiles, either horizontally or vertically when necessary, so that in frames that only needed one kind of update, the rest of the time could be used for something else.
<br />
<br />That said, having to write to both name tables, both horizontally and vertically in case diagonal scroll happens, is a big waste of PPU bandwidth in my opinion. Lots of games could live with that, sure, but when you have more PPU updates not related to the scrolling, such as middle-of-the-screen name table changes or pattern table updates (these really demand a lot of time), the time spent copying repeated data will be missed.

<br />Fair enough. In this case, you can do what Crystalis does: Simulate single-screen mirroring by splitting the screen back to Nametable A, where it would have continued to Nametable B. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> Then you'll only need to write to one nametable, and you have an entire second nametable to have a status bar.
<br />
<br />Edit: Which is exactly what you mentioned before.

<br />Man, that is insanely complex for such a simple task. If you look at <em>Kirby's Adventure</em>, you'll see that it only writes $0A and $C0 to $2006, and then writes $00 to $2005 twice. I can't possibly find an explanation for what SMB3 is doing.
<br />
<br />BTW, sampsonk, I think I figured out the problem. Setting the scroll through $2006 is a nonstandard procedure, but we all know that's the only way to do it if we want to change the vertical scroll mid-frame. The catch is that some bits of the value you write to $2006 have a different meaning. Here's a simple description of what each bit does:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">-yyyNNYYYYYXXXXX<br /><br />XXXXX: coarse X scroll &#40;0 to 31&#41;;<br />YYYYY: coarse Y scroll &#40;0 to 29&#41;;<br />NN: name table &#40;0 to 3&#41;;<br />yyy: fine Y scroll &#40;0 to 7&#41;;</div><br />So if you write $2360 to $2006, this is what will happen:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">-yyyNNYYYYYXXXXX<br />0010001101100000</div>
<br />Note that you are writing 010 (2) to the fine Y scroll, which will cause the top scanlines of your status bar to not be displayed, it will be shifted up. To fix this, write $0360 to $2006 instead. Also, write $00 to $2005 twice to clear the fine X scroll.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for all the info!  @tokumaru: that definitely was the problem.  I changed it to write $0360 rather than $2360, and it worked perfectly.  Explains why it was offset by the amount that it was.  I guess $2006 behaves differently depending on whether or not it's currently rendering the frame.  
<br />
<br />I was trying to figure out how Crystalis and SMB3 handled its mid-frame scrolling changes, but couldn't quite follow it.  The example you posted helped out a lot.  One thing I still don't quite understand is why it seems like you're writing the y-scroll to $2005 first, then the x-scroll, before the final write to $2006.  Loopy's doc and my own tests during vblank indicated that should be reversed.  However, it does seem to work with y-scroll first when changing it mid-frame.
