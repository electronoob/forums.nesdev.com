<br />
<br />The assembly source has always been included with PPMCK; removing features is very easy to do, and you can place the code at whatever address you need.

<br />
<br />I already answered to zzo38's private message, but now that I have a bit of time I post a better answer here: yes I did some minor improvements on ppMCK. Here's what I did:
<br />
<br />-Fixed some engrish in error messages
<br />-Added "#EX-VRC-VII" : alias for "#EX-VRC7"
<br />-Added "#EX-VRC-VI" : alias for "#EX-VRC6"
<br />-Added "#EX-SUNSOFT5B" and "#EX-SUN5B" : alias for "#EX-FME7"
<br />-Added "#EX-NAMCO163" : alias for "#EX-NAMCO106"
<br />-Added MN&lt;num&gt; for XYZ tracks : it's like M&lt;num&gt; (Sunsoft 5B hardware speed) but produce tuned notes at NTSC speed.
<br />-Added Z&lt;num&gt; : direct write to $4011 (like in FamiTracker)
<br />-Added Y&lt;num&gt; : sample offset (like in FamiTracker, though because I never used the Y command in FamiTracker, I don't know if it does the exact same thing)
<br />-Added @@&lt;num&gt; support for XYZ tracks, but results are not yet satisfying because of how the ppMCK driver handles the noise mode with notes.
<br />-Added a weird hack (special looped mode) in DPCM code.
<br />
<br />As you can see, they are rather simple improvements, if not simply "mods". The "weird hack" is only a change of the meaning of "IRQ DPCM mode" : it plays the sample in looped mode, but then immediately rewrite $4012 and $4013 with the last two bytes of the sample (added to that purpose) to change the loop points in the sound. Works on real hardware, but is likely not useful to anybody else. I can explain it more and post a demo of it in action when I have the time.
<br />
<br />I'll come back with this when I finish my final exams and my project for the project course.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />~J-@D!~, on the subject of a loop point for DPCM samples, do you need to use an IRQ? Can you just rewrite $4012/4013 with the loop points immediately after starting playback?
<br />
<br />I haven't tested this on hardware, but I would kind of expect that the hardware doesn't read the $4012/4013 register values except when starting playback or restarting the loop.
<br />
<br />Or... were you saying that this does work, and you had replaced PPMCK's DPCM IRQ feature with it as a hack?

<br />
<br />If you try to change the loop point immediately, it may fail if there is a byte sitting in the DMC buffer.  But it's safe to write the loop points one frame later.  Need to wait for the remaining sample byte to drain, which can take up to 3500 CPU cycles.
