I'd expect it to be pretty consistent.<br /><br />I've seen really cheap capture devices with a severely drifting pitch, but that's kind of a different category of device...

I've tested the DirectSound version on a wide range of hardware, and haven't run into any issues.  If you get a chance, and don't mind taking a few minutes, can you try nemulator and see how it performs?  You can see similar displays there by pressing F4 (line graphs) and F9 (info).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, trying nemulator, the effective rate seems to be a lot more stable than in your test program. It's not always stable, but mostly fairly stable (seems to settle for long periods of time), when it moves I do hear the difference, at least on simple tests of sound, but not as pronounced a difference as in the test program. Is there filtering to reduce the aliasing? That probably helps a lot, here.<br /><br />When it shifts significantly, the pitch drift does bother me, but I don't think it'd be a dealbreaker when playing a game. Truthfully, I'd much prefer stable pitch if it were an option, though. Maybe it's because I'm musically oriented, I dunno. I do think it's an interesting approach to the sync problem.<br /><br />What we're trading off against here, 60.1Hz dropping 1 frame every few seconds bothers me, but it's like, 1 dropped frame in 1000 is a bother, 1 dropped frame in 100,000 isn't at all, you know? That's why I think my most preferred approach would be a stable rate that closely matches my monitor's 60Hz refresh.<br /><br />Disch's approach that fakes a little extra audio to take up the slack seems acceptable too-- it's similar to what a non-emulating game would typically do, i.e. just run audio generation in its own thread and respond to the CPU as signals come in. Can't fully do that with emulation where the music has to be played by the CPU, but the principle of letting the audio continue on its own is similar.<br /><br /><br />As an aside, nemulator's keyboard controls seem to be broken for me, like they seem to be doing typical text entry press once, pause, auto-repeat behaviour. In metroid I can't jump to my full height because of this. The A button cuts off instead of letting me hold it down, then rapidly repeats.

Anything that's programmed to &quot;key off of&quot; a common 60Hz value will be affected.<br /><br />Microsoft documented this in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2006076" class="postlink">KB 2006076</a>, which they have since removed from their site circa 2016 sometime (reasons unknown), but <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150327154313/http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2006076" class="postlink">it basically said &quot;this is normal&quot;</a>.  Windows 7 SP1 x64 has pretty much pissed in my Cheerios for some time now regarding this; shit that worked fine on XP doesn't in 7 (NestopiaUE is a good example -- the first thing I noticed was &quot;cyclic stuttering&quot; at set intervals that wasn't present on XP).  I deal with this in other things too, including MAME.  My Dell 2407WFP &quot;suffers&quot; from this phenomenon (and it'll be a cold day in hell before I give it up; PVA panels are great, and aren't made any more, unlike IPS and the several horrible traits it comes with (IPS glow ranks at the top of my list)).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hrm, looking it up, at least in Windows a true refresh rate is not exposed, and unless you can go through the driver somehow, the only only Windows API for refresh rate query returns <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd144877(v=vs.85).aspx" class="postlink">only an integer</a>, so... asking Windows seems to be unhelpful. I don't quite understand what's new about Windows 7 from the stuff you linked, this API has been there for ages, but maybe the display settings utility now uses its own API and displays only the rounded-down integer approximation? (I don't remember what the settings looked like in XP).<br /><br />Anyhow, what I'd take away from that is that if you're going to do anything based on a fixed refresh rate, do this:<br /><br />1. Measure it directly.<br />2. Provide the user with a manual override, and make sure they can use a decimal point.<br /><br />I believe, though, that monitor refresh rates do tend to be quite stable. Once you've chosen it accurately you should be able to get reliable behaviour from it.<br /><br />Tepples asked how long you'd have to measure it to get reliable results. The <a href="https://www.vsynctester.com/index.html" class="postlink">HTML5 test</a> I linked earlier seems to reach 4 digit accuracy in under 5 seconds, and settling on a 5th digit takes another 5 or 10 seconds. Because this kind of test tends to be subject to sudden spikes and interruptions, I believe it's important to filter outliers from your average when measuring; once removed the remaining points of data should be pretty consistent?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">James wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Thanks for testing it out.

Seems better with that turned off.<br /><br />As for the problems, it's stable most of the time but if there's a sudden spike it shifts a lot at once and I can hear the pitch drift.<br /><br />I've attached a ROM that might help demonstrate the problem. Start the test tone in the ROM, and then play an A440 Hz reference pitch from some other device. The NES tone isn't exactly 440 Hz (there are accuracy constraints) but it's a constant pitch, and it will have a consistent beating according to how many Hz it's out of tune with your reference pitch.<br /><br />Once doing this test, cause a spike in execution to happen. I guess it sometimes happens due to background processes, but it seems like I can reliably make it happen by switching to another windows for a moment, and then switching back. After the momentary lag listen to the rate of beating change as it suddenly drifts to compensate. I can easily measure differences of several Hz this way.<br /><br />Like, probably wouldn't be very noticeable in to most people, especially when playing a game, but for me personally it's really objectionable to have the pitch drifting like this. Some people might like this way of syncing though, like it does at least produce &quot;seamless&quot; audio to match its target framerate, and that much is good. (I probably have a strong bias because I have an interest in musical instrument tuning.)<br /><br />If you had a way to filter out lag spikes, it might make it possible to eliminate significant drift, too? Dunno how much you can do this without losing your 1:1 audio:video goal.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(acoustics)" class="postlink">beating</a> I meant in the sense of tuning. It's from this trigonometric identity:<br /><br />sin(x) + sin(y) = 2 * sin(​​(x+y)/2) * cos((x-y)/2)<br /><br />This means if you play two sine tones that are close in pitch, what you will here is one sine tone at their average pitch that &quot;beats&quot;, i.e. fades in and out at their difference.<br /><br />For example if you play 440 Hz and 442 Hz together, it is the same sound as 441 Hz beating at 2 hz. You can use this to accurately measure the difference between two tones by listening and timing the beats.<br /><br /><br />So... when I was referring to beating in this last post, I was not referring to a sound heard from nemulator, but the combined sound of a reference tone I was playing externally with the tone coming from the test ROM in nemulator.

I was not comparing a reference pitch to anything else, the FLAC file was simply the direct output from your program to my sound device.<br /><br />In that case I think it's basically just aliasing caused by your not-bandlimited input being highly sensitive to minute differences in your resampling rate. Some harmonic relationship of the samplerate vs. some harmonic (or aliased harmonic) of the tone generated where they are close to in tune with each other.
