Wow, this thread kind of took off didnt it <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Memblers: I seen your cart before but noticed it hasnt been in production yet. If someone would actually make it to that stage it would be great. I wouldnt care if its serial or USB (Actually thats a lie, i prefere USB since its nicer looking) As long as someone would make compatible programming software for it, linux windows what ever. I have wine so Im good.<br /><br />teaguecl: Copycart, is that something you just made, or are the schematics available? Im looking for something realitivly small so it would fit into a NES. <br /><br />I was originally wiring a regular old NES cart into my NES but I am getting two 72 pin edge card connecters off ebay for less then $10 CAD, so I'm probably going to wire one internally so I could make a flash cart, since what I'm asking for doesnt seem to be reasonable to get, and i certainly could not make one myself. Im going to have to remove the expansion slot, and also dremel down a few screw holes that the metalic sheilding used. I may even have to drill out the indents put in to remove the expansion ports cover from the bottom of the nes, and flatten it out with body filler or something to make even more room in there.<br /><br />Thanks for all the information, but it looks like im just gonna have to make a devcart that I can plug in and out.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=471">lungdart</a> — Sun May 21, 2006 9:28 am</p><hr />

VCC / VEE is typically used on circuits involving bipolar transistors. VCC means "Voltage Collector", and VEE "Voltage Emmiter". VEE can either be equal to GND (0V) or be a negative voltage, so use of numbered voltage is defintely better.<br /><br />VDD / VSS is typically used on circtits involving FET transistors. VDD is "Voltage Drain" and VSS "Voltage Source".<br />Since FET transistors are more recent, normally VDD and VSS should be newer than VCC and VEE. However, I'm unsure, and the use of numbered voltage can be better (+5V is more meaningfull than VCC or VDD).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat May 20, 2006 2:29 pm</p><hr />

This is why vss (source) is at ground, it is the source of the electrons.  The electrons move from vss (source) to vdd (drain).  That confusion is part of why vss/vdd have mostly been replaced.

(simplified answers to avoid physics....)<br /><br />+5v = positive 5 volts<br />vcc = same as +5v for nes stuff<br />vdd = same as +5v for nes stuff (from the old "drain")<br /><br />gnd = ground, 0 volts.  All voltages are measured relative to ground.<br />vss = same as gnd (from the old "source")<br /><br />vpp = programming voltage, usually +5v or +12v.  Eproms usually need high voltage to set the fuses.  Your programmer will take care of all this.<br /><br />"left floating" = an unconnected wire.  Random background noise can cause the wire to "float" from high to low, sucking power and changing the circuit. This is why an unconnected input is a BAD idea.  Unconnected output is ok.<br /><br />Axx = address lines, A0 = least significant address bit<br />Dxx = data lines, D0 = least significant data bit.  Hopefully you will only have D0-D7 because it is an 8 bit system...<br /><br />---<br /><br />Connecting power and ground is another BAD idea, so you will need some switches on the cart for the hardwired lines like /WE.  If the board has /WE connected to +5 and your programmer tries to connect it to gnd for writing, bad things will happen.  Bad may include broken programmer, fried mem chip, and releasing of the magic smoke.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=228">bunnyboy</a> — Sat May 20, 2006 1:49 pm</p><hr />

I use some 64kb EEPROMs. They work great, but Flash is better. EEPROMs need an erasing step, Flash don't.<br /><br />AFAIK, Vcc is the working voltage, the same as +5V, for the NES. Vpp is the programming voltage, used by EPROMs. I can't really describe what GND is. The "Axx" pins are the ADDRESS pins, one for each bit. And "Dxx" are the DATA pins, also one for each bit.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat May 20, 2006 1:34 pm</p><hr />

I suppose you are right, I was thinking more like EEPROMs. Does anybody even use EEPROMs here? The most common seems to be EPROM and Flash.<br /><br />EDIT: A couple of terms, I want to know what they mean, and what effect they have:<br /><br />+5V - This is self-explanitory, right?<br />GND - Ground, but what does that mean?<br />Vcc<br />Vpp<br /><br />I'm sorry, I just never knew what those really did, besides the +5V, I kinda know what that means. And a pin is called Axx. What's the difference between Axx and Dxx? What does the A in Axx stand for? Sorry if you can't answer all these questions at once, if you just linked me to something, that'd be good enough =).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat May 20, 2006 1:10 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, it means exactly that. I said that because Flash ROMs have this WE (write enable) pin, wich has no use during play, but is tied to +5V (seemed to work for me) so it's not left floating. But it is necessasy during programming, and since it's tied to another used pin some kind of short-circuit could take place... I don't know...<br /><br />But what is the point of trying this with an EPROM, since it's not simply erasable...? This could be very useful for Flash, that can just be reprogrammed without even needing to be erased first.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat May 20, 2006 12:50 pm</p><hr />

I thought of something similar, with wires comming out of the devcart and going into a socket that you'd plug into the programmer.<br /><br />But I figured some of the rewiring could interfere with the programming. Such as pins that you tie to GND or +5V so they will not be left floating, but would have an actual function while in programming (Write Enable?)...<br /><br />I don't know. Haven't though about it a whole lot.

This is probably a really dumb question, but is it possible that you could solder wires from each pin of the EPROM/Flash chip, and put each end in the programmer, and program it like that? Here is a picture of what I'm trying to say:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.freewebs.com/the_bott/idea1.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><br />So you could have the chip soldered into the cart, and wires soldered to the ends of the pins sticking out of the cart, so you could just stick those in the programmer, and the programmer would read the chip through the wires! Is this possible? Or would it slow things down too much (with programming) and screw up the game?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat May 20, 2006 10:10 am</p><hr />

My Squeedo devcart hooks up to a PC's serial port.  You power-cycle the NES, upload your ROM using a terminal program and it re-programs and runs.  I was supposed to have released it a long time ago, but my plans with the firmware were pretty ambitious so it hasn't been finished to my satisfaction (someone wrote that the complexity of embedded software grows to fill the available memory, it's damn true <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />).  Plus other real-life-based issues getting in the way, so I haven't been working on it non-stop.  All the firmware is updatable though.  The basic functionality is already there.<br /><br />I've built a couple, I can make a few more if anyone might want to buy one and be a guinea pig.  A while back I was meaning to post a thread on here looking for developers to work with it (especially anyone willing to work with the special features like the PIC as a coprocessor), but I kinda got sidetracked and forgot.<br /><br />The CopyNES reprogrammable cart is done too, ready to ship a good couple dozen of them, but the bad thing right now is that it's only supported in the DOS/Win9x version of the CopyNES client.  Well, and I need to design a cart label for it.  Then I can open my little online store thingy, heheheh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat May 20, 2006 3:41 am</p><hr />

My CopyCart can do this, if you have your dev cart wired up just right.  It has a 72 pin nes connector on one side (to put your devcart into) and a usb connector on the other.
