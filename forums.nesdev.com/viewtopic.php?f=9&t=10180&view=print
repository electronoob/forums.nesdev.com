I'd appreciate it if someone could answer my questions or direct me to resources that answer them.<br /><br /><br />1. I've purchased Repropak boards and Ciclone lockout chips to go on them.  I understand that I will need at least 2 EPROMs, 1 for PRG data and 1 for CHR data.  What other hardware will be needed on the board at minimum?  <br /><br />2. Specifically, what type of EPROMs are compatible with Repropak and where do you recommend purchasing them?<br /><br />3. I took apart my copy of The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask for N64 and realized there was no battery inside.  I could be wrong but I think newer games use EEPROMs to save data without the need for batteries.  Can these be used to save data on NES games without batteries?<br /><br />4. What is the difference between different mapper chips (i.e. 74HC32, 74HC161) as well as different board names (i.e. SROM, UROM, NROM, CNROM) and how do I know which is necessary for my game?<br /><br />5. What types of Capacitors, Mapper chips and other parts are compatible and where do you recommend purchasing them?<br /><br /><br />Thanks for your help.

If you save more than 10-100k times the EEPROM would eventually fail but I don't think anybody have to worry about this, even if some guy saves several times a day for all his life he'll still be safe.<br /><br />Also this technology might have been more expensive in the early 90's and beacme cheaper later, which would explain the switch from Nintendo ? I have no idea. GBA games uses either of those technology. You can generally tell by how long it takes to save, if it is almost instant then SRAM is used, if it takes time then EEPROM is probably used.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">4.

Nowdays with the rise of programmable logic devices, those are hardly used anymore.<br />The 74HC161 is a counter (which is used simply as a latch in NES games (it actually took me years to figure this out !) ) and the 74HC32 contains 4 logical OR gates.<br /><br />To know which mapper is necessary for your game is a bit tricky, but if you're serious about homebrewing you should definitely read about mappers (Dish made an excellent document).<br />Basically :<br />- If your game can fit in 32kb PRG and 8k CHR no need for a mapper<br />- If you need more CHR but your game fits in 32kb PRG, you can use CNROM mapper 3<br />- If you need more PRG, you can use CHR-RAM instead of CHR-ROM and use UNROM mapper 2 or ANROM mapper 7<br />- If you need even more advanced features, you should use a custom mapper like MMC1, MMC3, MMC5, etc, etc...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here's my advice: if you need a mapper (I.E. more than 32kb PRG-ROM or 8kb CHR-ROM/RAM, or any WRAM) then use MMC3. It's a very capable mapper with plenty of options, widely supported by emulators thanks to games like Mario 3, widely available donor carts due to the huge amount of games released with it, and an available development board: <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=8808" class="postlink">http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=8808</a>.<br /><br />Whatever you decide, just don't fall into the same trap I did: spending all your time deciding on the best technology instead of making a game. The mapper doesn't make the game. Also, don't worry too much about hardware testing in the beginning. Use <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=6773" class="postlink">NintendulatorXD</a> for development and you should be pretty OK once you get to hardware.<br /><br />Also, look into using PDIP Flash chips instead of EPROM. I've also seen some self-contained battery-backed SRAMs, but they are pricey.

You'll also need solder, of course. I usually get most parts from Mouser. Digikey is also a popular source. If you're only planning to make 2 or 3 carts, maybe just find them at a local electronics shop (it's all standard stock stuff).<br /><br />qbradq, you realize bog7 may have chosen the ReproPak specifically to avoid having to harvest old games? If you're trying to build a game from new parts, MMC3 is not generally very good advice, IMO. I think infiniteneslives' MMC3 repro solution might be available at this point, though it probably can't be as cost effective as the simple discrete logic mappers that the ReproPak supports. (Not to mention bog7 already <em>has</em> the ReproPak.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm just a bit jaded on the whole mapper topic <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> I have a repro board from retrozone and they do work very well. It's just my opinion, but I think there's very few cases were a modern homebrew project that requires more than NROM will end up only needing expanded PRG or CHR ROM. MMC3 is an excellent target, and is roughly as available as all the other common mappers.<br /><br />I could mention that an MMC1 repro board is available from retrozone as well, but personally I dislike that mapper. It is a little clunky to use in software, a little restrictive in hardware, and could be easily replaced with an MMC3 for roughly the same cost.<br /><br />So Bog7, if that is in fact your real name <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> If all you need are the discrete ICs and a few caps, check out <a href="http://www.futurlec.com/" class="postlink">Futurlec</a>. They have a decent assortment of memory and a wide selection of 74-series IC's as well as all the other discrete components. Shipping can be a little on the high side for small orders, but they are a very reliable supplier and I have used them for years. They also have proto boards, cheap (but quality) tools, solder and the like.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.digikey.com/" class="postlink">DigiKey</a> is great for bulk orders and always have 74-series and other discretes in stock. Unfortunately their selection of DIP-packaged memory is very spotty and often overpriced.<br /><br />The most recent supplier I have used was <a href="http://www.jameco.com/" class="postlink">Jameco</a>. Again their selection of DIP-packaged memory is spotty, but it seems to be better than DigiKey's (especially for the larger sizes). I have had very good customer service from them.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />RetroZone's MMC1 board/cpld hasn't been available in years, and seems at this point to have silently been removed from its catalogue altogether.<br /><br />MMC3 is okay, but as far as (new parts) repro feasibility there's a huge gap between something that needs 1 or 2 discrete logic chips and something that needs 2 CPLDs. If you're harvesting boards from old games, though, yeah, it's about as easy to get MMC3 as anything else.<br /><br />I'd say MMC3 is good if you have an idea that needs fine bank switching (e.g. CHR flipping animation, DPCM swapping), and presumably you have a use for the IRQ as well. <s>If you only need the IRQ, MMC1 just as good</s>, really (yes the bankswitch is annoying, but it's only a few lines of code that you write once). If you don't need either of those things, the discrete logic mappers can give you plenty of ROM space to work with, and there's still lots of interesting stuff you can do without an IRQ, especially with CHR-RAM (see: Battletoads).<br /><br />Edit: MMC1 doesn't have IRQ <em>what have i done</em>

Battletoads is indeed a great showcase of what's possible to do without any assistance from extra hardware (I'm not counting access to extra ROM as a form of assistance).
