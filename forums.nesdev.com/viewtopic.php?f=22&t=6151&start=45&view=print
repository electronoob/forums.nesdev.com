<br />Still very early.
<br />Cats eating mice is broken right now, sometimes eats when it shouldn't eat.
<br />Game does not stop on lose conditions: when a cat eats a mouse, a cat reaches a rocket, or a mouse falls in a pit
<br />Game does not advance to the next level when you meet win conditions: get all mice into the rocket
<br />Game mode selection screen at the beginning is a dummy, just a picture of the menu.
<br />
<br />Controls:
<br />D-Pad: move the cursor
<br />A + Direction: Place an arrow if you have one remaining - or pick up an arrow at the cursor location
<br />B: pick up last placed arrow
<br />START: Start moving everything
<br />SELECT: Go back to arrow placement screen, or go back to level selection screen.  If at level selection screen, selects which set of levels (4 pages)
<br />
<br />
<br />Specifically, I want to know:
<br />*When you select levels, if the graphics updates for the top half, bottom half, and attributes appear to happen in separate frames (Nestopia), or all at once like it should (FCEUX, Nintendulator, VirtuaNES, QuickNES, etc...)  This one seems to be a scrolling related problem, where Nestopia displays the wrong nametable.
<br />*If there are any sprite glitches caused by turning off the screen early.  Maybe flickering on screens with 8 or fewer sprites per scanline.
<br />*Or just give me some feedback on what you think so far.
<br />

<br />
<br />4 player support is planned, but dual controller mode (to place arrows with a direction key on another controller) is not.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Using my PowerPak/NTSC NES, I get sprite flickering, even if there are fewer than 8 per line.  It only happens when there is a cat on the screen.  For instance, on level 12 the pointer flickers anywhere on the screen, but on level 1 it doesn't.  After pressing start, the cat on level 12 still flickers slightly while it is walking around.  Also the arrows on the ground flicker when a mouse moves over them.
<br />
<br />EDIT: the cat flickering seems to get better once the mice have left the screen.  But that's only on "one cat" levels.  Add another cat and you're back to flickers, even if they are on different scanlines.

<br />The screen update issue in Nestopia is best noticed when you switch between a level with pits and a level without them.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />D is by far the best, but I still get some flicker in regards to the cursor.  When the cursor is on a line with one cat, the top left of the arrow flickers.  When the cursor is on a line with two cats, both the cats and all of the cursor flickers.  Once the game starts it's solid so long as there aren't a lot of cats, level 22-4 is an epilepsy lawsuit in the making.  Interesting tho.. the last row of that level has only 4 cats, I believe that would be 8 sprites, yet it still flickers very badly.  I just tried it with the other rom versions and D is the best, but it's still really bad. 18-4 is really bad too, and it's flickering on that last row of only three cats.

<br />
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />I just tried out all those builds in Nintendulator, and they all fail miserably, drawing a bunch of random sprites in random places, but the sprites are okay in other emulators.

<br />E - Lots of flicker. Cats flicker as long as there are mice on the screen.
<br />
<br />F - Similar to A.  Cats flicker until everything is moving.
<br />

<br />
<br />H - Single cats don't flicker but multiple cats flicker unusually bad, regardless of how many are on a line.
<br />
<br />Hopefully someone else will chime in on the screen updates, though...

<br />
<br />There is no sound or music yet.  It does not yet keep track of which levels you have cleared.
<br />
<br />Puzzle mode is basically complete.
<br />Stage Challenge mode isn't finished:
<br />* Missing the 30 second time limit
<br />* The 100 mice and Cat Soccer levels don't do anything.
<br />There is no multiplayer mode yet.
<br />
<br />The layout of screens and such is subject to change.  Can anyone design better looking "Stage Cleared!" windows?
<br />
<br />Controls:
<br />* Start or A: Confirm or select something
<br />* B or Select: Cancel or go back
<br />
<br />Puzzle Mode:
<br />* A + Arrow: place an arrow, replace an arrow, or pick up an arrow
<br />* B: Take back the latest placed arrow
<br />* Select: Quit, or return to puzzle mode if the game is running.
<br />* Start: Set the game in motion!  Also toggles double speed mode while the game is running.
<br />
<br />Stage Challenge:
<br />* A + Arrow: place an arrow.  You can only have 3 on at a time, and can not place arrows on top of another.  Arrows last for 10 seconds before they expire.
<br />* Select: Quit
<br />
<br />Emulator Compatibility:
<br />Works great in FCEUX, Nintendulator, Nestopia, VirtuaNES, QuickNES, Mednafen.
<br />Almost works in LoopyNES, there is some vertical shaking.
<br />Almost works in PocketNES, there isn't any screen shaking or timing problems like in other emulators, but it hits some limits of bankswitching and tilemap updates so the graphics look bad.
<br />Fails on most older emulators.
<br />Joystick reading doesn't work on RockNES for some reason.
