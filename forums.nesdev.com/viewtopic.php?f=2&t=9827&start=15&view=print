Due to the difficulty of dividing that amount between the top and the bottom of the screen, I decided to hide them all at the top (looks pretty good on my TV, at least).</div><br />I'd just add this is the only way to have 8x16 sprites cleanly getting in and off the screen on the top border. Since sprite's coordinate can't be signed (anything from $f0 to $ff is considered a disabled sprite), it is impossible to have a sprite partially in the screen, and having the sprites &quot;pop-up&quot; can be noticeable, especially with 8x16 sprites. This can be even more annoying than attribute clashes.<br /><br />So in order to have 100% clean scrolling for both BG and sprites it is required to :<br />- Enable the left border clipping<br />- Find some way to disable graphics on the top 16 pixels by one of the ways mentioned in this thread (or top 8 if 8x8 sprites are used)<br /><br />And this no matter what mirroring is used.

That would be kind of cool. Though I think an IRQ is the best way to go, combined with setting the graphics banks to all blank tiles. But if you can make it work with less, go for it as long as it works well. It's amazing what RARE did with discrete mappers and CHR-RAM.

It's a very clean solution if you have a scanline/cycle counter available. You can still use this easily at the top of the screen without an scanline counter if you have a way to count cycles from the top of the screen (VBlank is constant timed or you detect the start of the frame waiting for the overflow or sprite 0 hit flags to clear).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It's amazing what RARE did with discrete mappers and CHR-RAM.</div><br />They didn't care about the alternate dot crawl pattern, though.

But honorable mention also goes to Time Lord and Wizards and Warriors III.  Wizards and Warriors III makes a copy of one of the tiles to add a dot to that tile, then makes sprite 0 (another dot) hit that tile.  Time Lord does that, and also uses DMC IRQs to ensure that the code to wait for the sprite 0 hit is called.

Since sprites can be hidden with 8 high priority sprites, it's perfectly possible to hide both BG and sprites without disabling graphics and without wasting a CHR-ROM page with blank patterns.

Unless you decide to make one of the colors always the same, which is a huge waste IMO, since they all share color 0 already. Two unique colors per palette is a pretty serious restriction if you ask me.</div><br /><br />Dangit, I didn't think of this. It's starting to look like my only option given my setup may be cycle timed code. Which, I don't think will be that bad. And, I thought more on it and I think as you may have already pointed out, the 9 sprite trick may be useful for graceful sprite clipping, too (in other words, if I'm not using it for sprite 0 hit, I can still use it just for sprite clipping and nothing else). Thanks.<br /><br />*edit* At one point, I was feeling hopeful that the palette itself could be bankswitched out using bankswitchable CHR-RAM. But, I believe the palette maps to registers in the ppu itself, you can't have a CHR-ROM palette for example?<br /><br />And, part of me is tempted to just simply never bother and rely on NTSC overscan. Problem is, I've already seen this not work as well as one might like on some TVs.

I hadn't noticed anything odd using cycle timed code to black out graphics for the top 16 or so scanlines within an emulator. I must have something else wrong though because on FCEUX, some actual previously uploaded CHR data seemed to get corrupted---but it was fine on Nestopia and Nintendulator (granted, my very quick try has not been smoothed out yet.)<br /><br />Is dot crawl a fairly subtle effect? From a little bit of reading, it sounds like that subtle jagged edge effect one can see in a composite signal. If it just juggles that pattern a bit, I can't imagine finding this too bothersome.<br /><br />*edit* also, how bad would it look to actually upload a black palette before end of vblank, and then upload the correct palette (after waiting with cycle timed code)? If it just produces a one pixel wide glitchy looking line, I might actually be ok with this. Or is there another gotcha there? Hmm, if that can work, maybe hide the glitchy line with 9 sprites? (assuming the glitchy part of the line is short enough to be covered by all of these) This could eliminate dot-crawl problem by leaving graphics on but also help with sprite clipping at same time perhaps?

Maybe I should just throw in the towel and make my game single-screen only, LOL. I'm tempted to just leave it as using NTSC overscan straddling the row update between the top and bottom 8 pixels. It'll look 99% ok on most TV's. I'm pretty sure Mega Man 1 uses the straddle technique when scrolling vertically. And I know Super Bat Puncher does, and it looks great.<br /><br />I forget why you must have rendering off to upload the palette. I know I ran into this before and found I must always upload the palette either inside vblank or with rendering off, does it cause tearing in places other than the scanline currently being rendered? I can't remember.
