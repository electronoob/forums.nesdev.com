		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is there any NES game which uses more than one tile layer? I am studying a game made for another system which renders static screens as Metroid does, by rendering blocks which are made of tiles. However, this is an isometric game and some tiles are drawn over others (for example, we draw a block that is the floor of the room, and then draw a pillar. Some of the pillar's tiles will overdraw the floor ones, and you have to combine both.<br /><br />I wondered if something like this could be made for the SNES... I was thinking on using CHR-RAM, and 'rendering' the scene there, but I think that will be prohibitive.<br /><br />Hope I'm explaining well...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A lot of games simulate having two layers in various ways. I'll omit examples that are just a horizontal parallax split, since this is a relatively common/easy technique.<br /><br />* Mega Man 2's opening cinematic does some vertical parallax using sprites.<br />* Punch Out's jogging/bicycle cinematic does a little bit of horizontal parallax layering with sprites (the railing).<br />* Battletoads level 2 does vertical parallax by using CHR-RAM to scroll tiles at the edges of the screen.<br />* Solsice uses CHR-RAM to occlude the character if he walks behind parts of the environment.

That games has multiple scrolling planes every level.<br /><br />Since you specifically mentioned isometric games, I suppose you're not looking for scrolling layers, you just want to place tiles in front of other tiles. The NES has only one background plane and there's no way to add another one that doesn't require modifications to the console itself (this would involve putting 2 PPUs in the same NES), so everything that appears to have more than one layer is simulated. Some examples of isometric NES games are: Solstice, Snake Rattle n Roll, Marble Madness, The Immortal, R.C. Pro Am II, among others. Take a look at them and use an emulator with a pattern table viewer to study how each one draws their levels.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah yeah, Sword Master has a really simple and elegant technique for it. It uses MMC3, which has 1k CHR banking, and then just has 32 1k CHR banks dedicated to 4 32x32 scrolling tile animations. Really simple to set up and code for, no fancy timing or anything, all you need is a mapper with 1k CHR banking and 32k of CHR ROM space to spare! (Batman RotJ does a similar thing for some scrolling clouds.)<br /><br />Probably the most complicated techniques are the ones that use CHR-RAM, since they tend to require very optimized NMI routines to get that data across in vblank (e.g. Battletoads puts CHR write code in RAM then modifies its immediate values), or something like Solstice where it's doing a lot of bit packing to build CHR tiles on the fly.

I'm more, as Dwedit pointed out, in the line of isometric, static backgrounds, but as iso tiles are not square, parts of foreground tiles will unavoidable be mixed with the floors and things like that.<br /><br />This is the game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Solstice used CHR RAM to cut background tiles out from in front of the hero sprite. This can get CPU intensive if a lot of sprites are moving, but you don't absolutely need 60 fps. A lot of these old isometric games for 8-bit micros ran at 5-8 fps, so a Micronics style 12 fps should be enough.

This works because the PPU first resolves the sprite collisions (if there are 2 sprites in the same screen pixel, the one with higher priority wins) and only then it resolves the sprite-background collisions, and since the sprite that's supposed to be rendered is behind the background, the background is drawn instead, effectively masking the first sprite. If you don't want to do it like this, the only option is to edit the CHR-RAM during runtime, like has been suggested.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">but ALSO have to be mixed with the floor when drawing the screen.</div><br />If your isometric tiles are 8 (not good if you use more than 4 colors though) or 16 pixels wide, you'll only have to worry about mixing the top and bottom of objects with further away tiles, and unless you predict all the overlaps that can happen (this is actually a good choice if you don't have that many different tiles or if you know the level design takes into account that some tiles can't overlap), you'll have to modify the tiles in CHR-RAM.<br /><br />It's perfectly possible to make isometric games on the NES, but it won't be as easy as creating a second background plane. You'll have to decide what limitations you can live with (how many colors you want, how many different tiles can overlap, etc.) and be ready to deal with more complex solutions (e.g. runtime CHR-RAM editing) depending on the limitations you absolutely don't want in the game.

Once I have an interpreter for the original data, which renders the screens on the NES, I'l worrry about taking it to 16 colors.
