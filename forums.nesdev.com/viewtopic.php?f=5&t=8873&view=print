		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi,
<br />
<br />As many have said before, by 1987 semiconductor ROM sizes were as large as 128KB, and that was the equivelant to both sides of an FDS disk image.  This has been the suggested reason as to why the FDS was dropped from Nintendo's product line, despite having its own awesome extra sound channel generator hardware, that I think beats the 2A03's DMC shortcomings by a considerable measure.
<br />
<br />However, there is probably more to this story.  As usual, Nintendo tries to go to a lot of trouble to protect their systems from 3rd party developers (as can be witnessed with the CIC/10NES program present on the NES and carts).  The FDS also came with a number of physical, electrical, and software lock-out schemes that tried to keep hackers out (i.e., Hacker International).
<br />
<br />When an FDS disk boots, the ROM BIOS looks for the name table file "KYODAKU", which just contains a copyright notice that the BIOS verifies and scrolls up on the screen, before the actual FDS game is booted up.  No KYODAKU file = BIOS returns an error message.
<br />
<br />Despite Nintendo's efforts to put the lock and key on FDS development, they seemingly allowed for the game's NMI handler to be enabled by default during the disk boot process.  So, all the game has to do to get NMI control (before the BIOS checks KYODAKU after the disk is read), is contain just a one-byte file at the end of the disk, that writes one single byte to $2000 to enable NMI's (plus waste some extra time with dummy disk reading to wait for the PPU's first VINT), and consequently circumvent the ROM BIOS's test for KYODAKU! 
<br />
<br />You would think that this very minor issue could have been something easily fixable by Nintendo with a revision of their ROM BIOS, but when you consider the fact that Nintendo actually expected developers to call their BIOS disk routines @ hard-coded addresses in ROM, it's no wonder why they couldn't make changes to it.  Personally, they should've taken advantage of the BRK #xx opcode to make any 1 of 256 BIOS system calls possible, but nevertheless, I'm sure one of the FDS ROM BIOS developers must have lost their shirt over this little back door. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />

<br />
<br />Are the FDS disks compatible with some other source of floppy disks? Or was it more about recycling old games by writing new data on existing disks?
<br />
<br />Because hardware scarcity or uniqueness is another thing Nintendo is good at. I'm sure they used "not sold in stores" mini DVD's for the gamecube to try and at least delay the inevitable.
<br />
<br />They do this too with their port connectors. I mean, they could have used the atari style 9-pin connectors on the NES or SNES. But they saw the potential accessory market.

<br />
<br />More importantly, it was in a different country with a very different intellectual property regime from the US. I know almost nothing about Japanese laws but my impression is that unlicensed console games were always considered much shadier there, and you would never see them in "reputable" stores like Tengen and Wisdom Tree games in North America.

<br />
<br />This security brench only makes it possible - once you can rewrite a disk - to boot without showing Nintendo's kyodaku screen.
<br />
<br />However, you could still create unlicenced FDS games and show Nintendo's kyodaku's screen without taking advantage of this security brench.

Obviously Nintendo put that file there as a way to control who can get licensing (as mentioned this was before SEGA vs thingie) This method bypasses that and gets around it.
<br />
<br />Back in the day this could've been pretty major.

<br />Reason for this is that the cost of rom and ic's went down alot in following years and it became more reasonable to make a cartridge with bigger rom.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Also, the ability in saving games when battery backed RAM could be added to cartridges. The FDS had lost its advantages by then. Also, you didn't need to swap disks and wait impatiently for the loadings with games on cartridges.
<br />
<br />I don't think being able to bypass the license message screen is any large security breach either as it's just for the licensing and not copy protection. Besides the advantages of cartridges over disks mentioned above, the main problem was pirating. Even consumers could copy the disks easily themselves provided they have the appropriate software. Nintendo did try to counter this by making revisions to the unit, such as limiting the size of data it could write in one go, but still, most units were just modded to circumvent this (I'm not sure but I've heard that the last revision could not be (easily) modded). The irony was that not only FDS games were pirated, but the drives were used alongside game copiers such as Game Doctors and Game Converters in pirating <em>cartridge</em> games (that's why the FDS was extremely popular here, possibly even more popular than in Japan).
<br />
<br />Another problem was, Nintendo tried to profit from selling the bulk disks, but people quickly realised that they could convert Quickdisks for use with the FDS and later bulk disks were even manufactured cheaply in factories (and the NINTENDO indent on the disks was just a joke as protect measures). Since the FDS didn't generate much profit (FDS games were meant to be sold at prices much lower than carts and some developers were not willing to develop FDS games; the pirating of the games just didn't help) there is no wonder Nintendo eventually gave up on it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Besides ROM memory falling in price dramatically and battery backed RAM on carts, another key problem with the FDS was Nintendo's strict licensing. If I recall, Nintendo got a partial copyright for any FDS games released. The profit margins may have been lower, etc. From a business perspective for developers it was a bad deal. 
<br />
<br />So it was both business and the aging FDS versus the better cheaper technology for carts. The FDS could have been upgraded with a new RAZM adapter, but that wouldn't have solved the piracy or loading issues. Later NES games were very commonly 128K, 256K, and 512K. FDS disks hold around 128K using both sides and I think it takes over a minute to scan the whole disk. So it would take considerable time before getting to play later games if you went that route.
<br />
<br />And ROM was probably cheaper than a large initial investment in DRAM for a disk type system for later games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You mean if file loading was optimized enough so that it would only take one pass?, which i suppose if you were basically loading DRAM with a cartridge image from FDS disk it wouldn't have been so bad. So 16 seconds plus disk flipping time to load up a 1 meg game like Mega Man or Ghosts and Goblins and still less than a minute for a 2 Meg game like Double Dragon, that actually doesn't sound that bad. But piracy is still an issue for magnetic disks. 
<br />
<br />I guess that isn't surprising that disk loading times were not really optimized.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Right, it seems like most games make a pass for each file they access since they can't buffer the whole side in memory. When they make you wait through two passes, flip, wait through a pass, flip back and wait through a final pass it's very aggravating. Games which load between scenery changes become infuriating when either dying or getting bumped off screen by an enemy triggers two sets of loading to get back to where you want to be (I think Dracula II is an offender). Also if you get a disk error you still have to wait for the pass to complete and sometimes wait through a second pass where the read is reattempted. Great games, miserable loading.
