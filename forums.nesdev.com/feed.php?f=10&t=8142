I've already made a sound engine for the SNES which works under real hardware but I lost the sources, I can still share my copiled SPC and a disassembled source but it wouldn't be of many uses.<br />However, I'd be ready to re-do it any time it's really not complicated. It's basically the same as the NES but with more features, and the most complicated thing is to prevent the "note on click" that happen if you key on on a channel which was already playing, a pop happens. So your engine should be careful to always key off at least one frame before you key on.<br /><br />Other than that, anyone who made a NES sound engine should be able to do a SNES one.<br /><br />Also the problem for me is not making the engine but making the editor for the PC. If people are ok with me releasing a SPC engine that requires you to type .dbs in a text file then I can release one anytime.<br />Or maybe a MIDI-&gt;ASM converter that makes assemblable files of lots of .db out of a MIDI file.<br /><br />The problem with this is that SPC limitations have nothing to do with MIDI limtations (same with XA) so converting is not very optimal.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Sep 20, 2011 2:31 am</p><hr />

I've been on the other side of the issue for too long. But even I can't deny the frequency of these kinds of threads going up and quite honestly....it's not ok anymore. This is a nes DEVELOPMENT community. We will help you put YOUR games on a cartridge. We're not here to help you set up your buisness of taking someone elses ip and selling it. Making a repro for your own use? Fine but don't neccesairly expect anyone here to help you (altough they usually will if you are genuinly interested in learning about electrical engineering and such)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3369">Jeroen</a> — Tue Sep 20, 2011 1:59 am</p><hr />

If such tools and driver were made I think SNES homebrew would be MUCH more popular since the SNES has so many great features and tons of memory. Not to say that anything is wrong with NES, but clearly some game ideas work better with more resources. And for some developers they might enjoy being less resource constrained in terms of memory and graphically.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Mon Sep 19, 2011 4:25 pm</p><hr />

I'm actually working on such an engine for personal purposes, and I can release it as PD when done. However, so far it is turns to be even more primitive than FamiTone, and tools are even more complex. Not many use FamiTone (only 2 people released games with it so far), even less would use this engine.<br /><br />I can certainly confirm that making sound code and music for SNES is a showstopper, even though I'm as a programmer mostly focus on this exact area and have enough experience. Tools aren't developed or very limited, sample compression makes conversion from common formats problematic, docs aren't clear, etc. There are few real heroes on the scene, like ekid who made <a href="http://ekid.nintendev.com/xms/" class="postlink">XMSNES</a> (too bad he dropped it, it was a lot of work for sure), but I'm personally don't feel that interested to make such a complex thing in these limitations, so I keep things very simple.<br /><br />My current process:<br /><br />- make/generate/record samples, convert them with a sound edtor into suitable format. It is important to sample certain note with certain samplerate, it would not loop nicely otherwise<br />- loop samples and design ADSR envelopes with a custom tool (with preview), the tool then creates empty XM file with instruments and data set for sound driver (compressed samples and misc settings)<br />- use empty XM to create music, then convert this XM to an assembly file with a custom tool; only instrument numbers, volume and notes are supported, other features of XM format are ignored<br />- use data set and assembly file in a program for SNES<br /><br />I start to think that making a dedicated SNES crosstracker, designed around sound system limitations, is not that bad idea.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Mon Sep 19, 2011 4:03 pm</p><hr />

Yeah I don't have a problem with anyone making carts for their own personal use and for friends, but it does get into an increasingly less grey area when it's offered as a service to anyone who can pay.<br /><br />Copyright laws might suck (terms are longer than they should be, IMHO), but it's still the rules.  Copyright is international as was mentioned already, so it doesn't matter where it was released or not.<br /><br />But this sort of thing will rub people the wrong way around here for various reasons, since a lot of us spend years of our lives working on game projects, and it will be irritating for a lot of folks to see someone skip over that entire process and go straight to producing and selling it. <br /><br />And for me at least, for years I've been wanting to get more into cartridge publishing but I've always been extremely limited by money available (I work full-time and cut every corner I reasonably can to save).  I've always known that I could have been making money by producing bootlegs of whatever people want to buy, but out of respect for developers (and the companies that once employed them) I've just refused to steal anyone's work.  Though it sure would be easier than designing hardware and software from scratch.<br /><br />I've got the Garage Cart series project on-going, which largely consists of stuff made by others, but it also has the problem of costing a lot of time and money up-front, but won't be very profitable for me because I want to share the profits with all the developers (which there are a lot of!).  I'm gradually working towards a big plan which will at least solve the production time problem, I'll just basically have to front my life savings and hope it comes back to me before I need it for something, heh.  I think it will work though.  For now it's sorta like working a second job without pay.<br /><br />BTW I've thought about making an SNES PCB.  I've wanted to for a while, maybe I'd do it if it could get used, but I don't think I'd be all that proud of it if it's only used for bootlegs. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Sep 19, 2011 3:11 pm</p><hr />

I have no idea about that engineering equitation, but try even reading through the first nerdy nights. That's not even SNES. Games have a ridiculous amount of programming, which is huge amounts of math. I enjoy it somewhat, but it gets old. And when you have so much data you have to manipulate, it becomes truthfully, a nightmare.<br /><br />And as for assembling them? A run of 100 games with all needing rewiring even for one chip would be stupid hard. First 5 may be fun, but 100 can only be fun for so long.<br /><br />And why be so nice when the scammers are not? I mean, I'd help if I could, but SNES isn't a homebrew-crazy platform like NES because it's complex and most of the only reason is to make pirates/bootlegs/whatever you call them. I mean, I don't think that's a bad thing myself, I look at the knowledge and know how should be available and everyone should be able to do it, but the fact is that we can't stratle the line of legality, because one day if it's passed, this site will be no more and all valuable knowledge that wasn't preserved will pretty much be lost. It's not worth helping 1 person out to their contention. I'd help if I knew, but I don't. I mean, I'm sure you can find Mask ROM pinouts for SNES and maybe some other chips like the MAD-1 online and then you shouldn't have to do anything more. Use that as a starting block. I hope you know how computers work, as this isn't something you can do in one week of study unless you have a good background in it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Mon Sep 19, 2011 2:24 pm</p><hr />

Seriously. What pleasure is there to solder a few tiny wires into holes and programming some EPROMs ? Nope. As a EE student I can say this is one of the most annoying part of the job.</div><br /><br />I completely understand your stance on the matter, and rightfully so. <br />However, I feel that it could have been presented a little bit more lightly. <br /><br />As for me, I don't see how the process of making the games COULDN'T be pleasureable. I'm not even an Engineering student, and I love to make things with my hands. So, being able to make a reproduction cart with my own two hands, would be extremely rewarding to me. <br />I understand if you don't choose to believe me, that my intentions are innocent with this. It is difficult to trust a random person, especially when online.<br />I respect your opinions on the matter. However, that doesn't make my intentions any less pure and it doesn't make me want to learn the trade any less either.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5013">Ownaholic</a> — Mon Sep 19, 2011 2:03 pm</p><hr />

Scrapping cartridges without a coprocessor, such as annual licensed sports games whose resale value is next to nothing, bothers me slightly less.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Sep 19, 2011 1:55 pm</p><hr />
