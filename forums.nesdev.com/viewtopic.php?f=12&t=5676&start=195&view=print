When playing on my PAL control deck, the console sometimes resets and keeps reset forever. Then I have to turn it off and turn it on again in order to play the game again (i.e., reset button doesn't work at all), but after a while, the same happens.<br /><br />What could the problem be?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, I have solved the problem: one 100nF decoupling capacitor was needed for PIC12F629.<br />I tried with 10nF but it still didn't work; I also connected to Vcc pin 4 because I had this pin lifted without connection to anything. Pin 4 is /PAIR mode, but it was not clear to me in documentation which value to tie up the pin to. I tried connecting it to GND but didn't work either.<br /><br />To summarize: 100 nF decoupling capacitor between pins 1 and 8 and pin 4 tied to Vcc made the chip work properly.

(EDIT: attiny13a:  digkey pn:  SOIC:ATTINY13A-SSU-ND 	DIP:ATTINY13A-PU-ND)<br /><br />Even so, I really don't think they are concerned about pinching pennies to use cheaper PICs.
