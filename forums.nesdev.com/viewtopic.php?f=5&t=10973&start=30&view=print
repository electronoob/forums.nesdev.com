		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />update here and i come for any input i can get. We found a much better datasheet and were able to decipher some information from the conexant xbox  and even some values. <br /><br />First here is the datasheet with the values: <br /><br />Please someone correct me if im wrong but i was able to decipher this for 240p for values to enter in our nkpatcher for xbox:<br /><br />NTSC<br />db 0x38, 0x76, 0x78, 0x7A, 0x7C, 0x7E, 0x80, 0x82, 0x84, 0x86, 0x88 0x8A ; register<br />db 0x40, 0xE0, 0x80, 0x94, 0xB0, 0x78, 0x09, 0x42, 0xCA, 0x27, 0x00 0xD0 ; 240p<br /><br />These values can be put in the nkpatcher.asm in the nkpatcher source linked below in the link. Here is the snippet with the original code we are trying to replace:<br /><br />conexantregs:<br />	db 0xD6, 0x2E, 0x32, 0x3C, 0x3E, 0x40, 0xC4, 0xC6, 0xCE, 0xA0, 0x9E, 0x9C, 0x6C ; register<br />	db 0x0C, 0x00, 0x48, 0x80, 0x80, 0x80, 0x01, 0x98, 0xE1, 0x8C, 0x00, 0x00, 0x46 ; 480p<br />	db 0x0C, 0x00, 0x48, 0x80, 0x80, 0x80, 0x01, 0x98, 0xE1, 0x21, 0x00, 0x00, 0x46 ; 720p<br />	db 0x0C, 0x00, 0x48, 0x80, 0x80, 0x80, 0x01, 0x98, 0xE1, 0x21, 0x00, 0x00, 0x46 ; 1080i<br />.end<br /><br />Using this nkpatcher we have tried this and so far, efforts have resulted in a black screen. However im posting the link to the nkpatcher source i am working with to see if theres anything we might be missing. Hopefully someone will see something we might be missing. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.qfpost.com/links.do?get=662e67d6afaea07cd6f583598ca59b13">http://www.qfpost.com/links.do?get=662e ... 598ca59b13</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Its real easy to compile with this download. You just make whatever changes you want to make to the source then click make_nkp11.bat to make an xbe. <br /><br />We can only see 2 autoconfigs for NTSC, and theres 2 for pal, 320x240 config, and 320x200. Hope to hear if anyone more talented than us sees something.

Off the top of my head, Bangai-O does, and either the first Street Fighter III (not Third Strike), or Alpha III, or both of them do. I think Yu Suzuki Game Works, also.<br /><br />Unless they're faking it in 480, but it looks pretty legit to my eyes.

(15750 ÷ 60 = 262.5) But it's monochrome.<br />NTSC (what most people mean when they say 480i) is 15734 Hz horizontal, 59.94 vertical, interlaced. (15734 ÷ 59.94 = 262.5 ; 15734 = 3579545 ÷ 227.5)<br />It is the non-integer ratio between the hsync and vsync rates that specifically causes interlaced behavior; the same is true for the old 1024x768@86i (ratio of 408.5) or the newer 1080i (ratio of 562.5).<br />240p is a clever abuse of NTSC, never intended. It horizontal to vertical ratio is either 262 or 263 scanlines depending on implementation. This would be equivalent to 480i with 524 or 526 scanlines per two fields. As such, the refresh rate will be slightly faster or slightly slower than 59.94 Hz.<br /><br />Most televisions will deal fine with signals that vary up to 1% from the nominal hsync rate and up to 5% from the nominal vsync rate. Some ( especially PAL sets) support all the way from 15625-1% to 15750+1% hsync and 47-63 Hz vsync.<br /><div class="quotetitle">*Spitfire_NES* wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">After reading this, i decided to post this here, i know i must sound like a noob, but is there not something i could do on the xbox with this? instead of messing with registers and encoders? makes it sound so easy.<br /></div>Unfortunately, what he's describing (&quot;failing to delay the second field by half a scanline&quot;) is exactly what reprogramming the conexant IC does.

This comes directly from the conexant encoders datasheet itself:<br /><br />1. The vertical scaling can be disabled by setting the internal<br />V_SCALE register to 4096 for a non-interlaced input.<br /><br />section 1.3.18 Standard<br />Flicker Filtering<br /><br />Other CX25870 registers and bits must<br />be reprogrammed to generate different video outputs. The bits in Table 1-18 are the most important settings<br /><br />Figure 1-17. Noninterlaced 262-Line (NTSC) Video Timing<br /><br /><br />1.3.33 Noninterlaced Output<br /><br />When the CX25870/871 is programmed for noninterlaced video out via the NI_OUT bit, it always transmits the odd field. The FIELD pin will continue to change state on the leading edge of the<br />analog vertical sync. A 30 Hz offset should be subtracted from the color subcarrier frequency<br />while in NTSC mode so that the color subcarrier phase is inverted from field to field. The transition from interlaced to noninterlaced in master interface occurs during odd fields to prevent<br />synchronization disturbance.<br /><br />Question, Could something like this be done through a more simpler means of not using a direct program or maybe something like hex editing?<br /><br />Also i know this was brought up before but this:  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nv-tv-out/files/?source=navbar">http://sourceforge.net/projects/nv-tv-o ... rce=navbar</a><!-- m --> has a link to use this program through xbox linux, but i have no means of getting this to work as everything i have tried is not working, but in the files there is a program for xbox for this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some new information has come to light regarding this possibility and figured i would post this here: <br /><br />this is taken from the xdk doc for xbox:<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF4000">[color=#BF0000]FieldRender Sample<br />The FieldRender sample shows how to do field rendering. Normally, Xbox games render to one 640×480 buffer at 60 Hz, and the hardware filters the buffer down to odd and even interlaced fields. With field rendering, a game renders separately for the odd and even fields, and only to a 640×240 buffer.<br /><br />Field rendering saves on fill rate (since only half as many pixels are drawn), but the resulting quality is not as good.<br /><br />Field rendering is enabled during device creation by using the D3DPRESENTFLAG_FIELD flag. The title must render at 60 fps for field rendering. To minimize flicker, the viewport must be offset by one scan line during the rendering of even fields. Finally, note that the flicker filter does not work when field rendering is enabled.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF4000">[color=#FF4000]Field rendering<br /><br />Field rendering is a special video mode where the back buffer size is assumed to be half the vertical height of the output display and the output format is defined to be interlaced. In this mode, the even lines of the display are rendered during one field and the odd lines are rendered during the next field. When using field rendering, the flicker filter is disabled. Field rendering can reduce the fill-rate and bandwidth requirements of a game substantially; however, since there is no flicker filter, display quality can also be somewhat degraded.<br /><br />Field rendering is supported with all AV packs.<br /><br />This video mode is enabled by specifying D3DPRESENTFLAG_FIELD as one of the flags ORed into the Flags member of D3DPRESENT_PARAMETERS.<br /><br />To minimize flickering, a screen offset needs to be applied during the rendering of even fields. IDirect3DDevice8::GetDisplayFieldStatus can be used to determine if the field is even or odd. Before rendering the even fields, the title should apply an offset of (0.0f, 0.5f) using IDirect3DDevice8::SetScreenSpaceOffset.</span><br /><br />Could this not be the information to make the xbox display only one field in 480i effectively 240p?
