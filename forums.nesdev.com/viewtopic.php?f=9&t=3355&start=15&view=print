<br />Yeah, as if collectors (like any other gamer) didn't have thousands of illegally downloaded ROMs anyway. If anyone that steps into this board (or any other board related to classic consoles) says they don't have plenty of ROMs somewhere, they'll be lying. Except for the porn bots, they probably don't play much.

<br />So true. Even tough I doubt Tepples will ever admit it.
<br />
<br />And I just realised something : It's really unbelivable that someone may be egoist not only to be proud to own an unique copy of a game and not want to dump it for other people because "he has all right to it", and to not even mention the title of the game to avoid other people possibly revealing stuff about his "preccciousss" cart.. Being SO much egoist is just inhuman.

But if they are going to <strong>dump it anyway</strong>, not releasing is indeed just egoistic.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">because "he has all right to it", and to not even mention the title of the game to avoid other people possibly revealing stuff about his "preccciousss" cart..</div><br />I'm glad he didn't mention the name of the game, or things would probably be worse. To avoid trouble, people who are not willing to share a rare game should just not mention they have it. Unless they do feel superior somehow by owning it, which is the only reason I can find for someone not to release a game they already dumped.<br /><br />The greatest idea so far was that of buying prototypes by means of donations, for the purpose of releasing it. That way, no one has to spend a ridiculous ammount of money and the world can enjoy the fine piece (that's subjective) of software, instead of letting it die.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">blargg wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Being SO much egoist is just inhuman.</div><br />I thought that was the defining characteristic of humans.</div>
<br />I'd have to agree with blargg here. People use the word "inhuman" to define bad things, but some of the worst things are indeed of human nature.

<br />
<br />mrmark0673, I can't help you get a CopyNES, but if your only concern is getting that proto copied, I can dump it for you if you're willing to lend it to me.  rbudrick here at nesdev and TheRedEye and DreamTR at DP can all vouch for me.  It'd be nice if you were willing to release the rom, but I won't give it to anyone if that's what you want.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was particularly thinking of Skrybe when I made my last post about Lost Levels.  In fact, I almost mentioned him, but figured it would be in bad taste without consulting him first.  But, there you have it.  
<br />
<br />You can trust Skrybe...he is is very good at dumping stuff and has done so for many other prototype owners, some of which made the same request of secrecy as you.
<br />
<br />In fact, he just did a redump of my one-of-a-kind NES Mickey Mouse III proto.  I, however, am releasing the rom to the public, value of my cart be damned.    I personally think all roms should be shared when they are old enough, but respect completely when folks don't want to.  When someone doesn't want to share a rom, the next best thing is to at least back it up, so you are doing the right thing.  When backing up a proto that isn't going to be released, at least the community can give a sigh of relief that a game is safely backed up somewhere, even if they don't get to play it.
