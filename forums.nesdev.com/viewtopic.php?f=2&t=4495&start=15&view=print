<br />
<br />You're totally right about the unused bit 5 allowing for additional fill modes. Offhand, I can't think of any other fill modes that would benefit me presently, but once I start adding other screens (cut scenes, menus, etc.) perhaps their layouts will open up some possibilities. For now, I think I'll save that bit for a rainy day. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />It's really cool bouncing ideas back and forth with you guys. I can't say there are tons of folks programming NES games in my neighborhood, so it helps me feel less isolated.

<br />
<br />Personally, I only intend to use this compression scheme for single screens. As is, it's probably not ideal for use in the levels. It's hard to say at this point because I haven't designed a complete level yet.
<br />
<br />For the levels, I'll probably group the tiles into 16x16-pixel or 32x32-pixel metatiles. Additionally, I may use a simple object definition for common entities such as platforms. In the latter case, instead of defining each tile (or group of tiles), I could just specify the position and dimensions of the platform.

<br />This kind of compression does not work well for level data, at least if applied directly to tile data. Most (if not all) NES games use a basic block (the metatile) size of more than 8x8. The use of metatiles by itself is already a compression scheme, and then you usually have others on top of this one. So you should first decide on the size of the basic blocks that make up your map (usually 16x16 pixels, 2x2 tiles) and how to encode them, then you decide what kind of compression to use on top of that.
<br />
<br />Saving some RAM for the maps will probably help a lot, because you'll be able to buffer whatever the decompression algorithm outputs, and use that data for collision as well as for updating the nametables little by little.
<br />
<br />Anyway, the best compression algorithm to apply on your metatiles will depend on the nature of your maps, what kind of redundancy they have. RLE will always save some space, since I can hardly think of a game that doesn't have wide areas of repeated blocks. An adaptive scheme like the one presented by SecretServiceDude could work well, because it has different types of compression, and at least one of them will be able to do something to a specific piece of data. It kinda reminds me of a <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/docs/smwcompress.txt" class="postlink">compression scheme</a> used by Nintendo in SNES and Gameboy games. I don't know if any NES game used it.

There are 7 possible types of compression, and the compressor indicates the one that was used for a particular run using the top bits of the command byte, like SecretServiceDude was doing, but with less types of compression.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The decoder is finally working, and I successfully switched over to the compressed name table for my title screen display. I added a few bytes to the data in order to simplify the decompression code, so the total size of my name table comes out to 128 bytes: a programmer-friendly number if ever there was one.
<br />
<br />So, what does 86.67% compression look like? Glad you asked:
<br />

<br />
<br />I decomposed the title screen into 6 regions. I used layering, so some regions appear in two separate sections onscreen, even though there's only one region defined in the data.
<br />
<br />Region #0 (Solid Fill Mode): The dark green background (covers the whole screen)
<br />Region #1 (Solid Fill Mode): The two horizontal bars above and below the title
<br />Region #2 (Solid Fill Mode): The light green background behind the title
<br />Region #3 (String Fill Mode): The word <em>Bionic</em> (lots of duplicate tiles)
<br />Region #4 (Ascending Fill Mode): The word <em>Commander</em> (no duplicate tiles)
<br />Region #5 (String Fill Mode): The copyright notice
<br />
<br />I'm no master artist, but I really dig that chrome effect.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />
<br />Thanks for the compliments! I'm glad you guys like it.
<br />
<br />So, here's the pattern table for the title screen:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img146.imageshack.us/img146/1281/titlescreentilesje0.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />So far I'm using 237 out of 256 tiles. The four red tiles are duplicates of tile[2]. Duplicating those tiles allowed me to describe the entire word "Commander" (30 x 6 tiles) as a single region with Ascending Fill Mode.
<br />
<br />As you can see, the word "Bionic" exhibits decent economy of space; however, the word "Commander" screams wastefulness.
<br />
<br />And that's exactly what I was going for.
<br />
<br />To me, "bionic" connotes mechanical precision, whereas "commander" connotes unabashed bravado. I think the grossly imbalanced tile distribution captures that dichotomy nicely. You put those two ideas together, and you've got yourself a rad game!

<br />Yeah, I figured it used most of the tiles. It looks really cool. It might be cool if you added stuff in where the dark green background is, like a sky of some sort with a few clouds. Though this would increase the size of the compressed screen.

<br />Glad to hear it! Good luck my man.
<br />
<br />I had been writing a bunch of engine code, which can get pretty dry after a while. I needed a reminder of <em>why</em> I was making the game in the first place, so I decided to switch gears momentarily and focus on something artistic.
<br />
<br />I must say, being greeted by a title screen when I fire up the ROM makes my game actually feel like a game now. A little bit of presentation goes a long way.
