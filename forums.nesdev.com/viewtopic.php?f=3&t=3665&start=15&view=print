I thought about it at first but for whatever reason decided against it.</div>
<br />
<br />My guess is that one cannot be confident enough in any rom file out there, cause both header bank sizes and the file size itself do not always match the real value, in the first case due to poor editing by rom dumpers and in the second because there are several overdumps and bad dumps with increased or decreased file sizes (according to MMC1 revisions, I've seen rom files 512 KB long whose real value is 256 KB, and viceversa).
<br />
<br />In my opinion, the real (and idealistic) solution to this comes by adding the revision number of the mapper into the rom file header. Does iNES2 achieve this? (sorry, I'm not up to date on that topic).

<br />Agreed. Consistently different state at power up demands representation, especially if code relies on it. Doesn't matter if they all say MMC1B on the chip, for example; still different hardware.
<br />
<br />But, if the (correct) ROM/CHR size provides the information, it doesn't need to be in the header. Overdumps are corrupt, so the solution to that is to fix the dumps, not add redundant information to the header.

<br />
<br />I agree. But one never knows what files the final user will input into the emulator, so the code must be prepared for the worst case. Bad dumps erradication seems to be a faraonic (if not impossible) task, so the way to go in this case comes by looking up CRC based configuration tables. And.. well, in my eyes, that's like adding a big hack into the emu.
<br />
<br />I mean, I agree in that PRG/CHR sizes should suffice, but using them blindly may lead to undesired trouble. And, in my opinion, the user should be kept away from any technical details, as with the real thing, so offering the possibility to choose between mapper revisions is quite interesting for a developer (we all), but may not for the casual. Aaarghh..! This is the kind of decision that stops me from advancing in my NES emulation project.

<br />I disagree, as many games in fact uses more than one version of the MMC1 at the same time, and if any relies on boot-up states, then make emulator have this boot state and let's doccument the actual things proprely on the Wiki when it comes to differences between versions.
<br />
<br />And no emulator should expect it's used to use bad dumps or overdums, if they crash, it's 100% of the user's fault. ROM sites should state clearly that download of over/bad dumps are discouraged and worthless (in fact they should even remove such dumps).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Maybe it will be a good idea in an emulator to have a title screen for problematic mappers, where the user can manually choose a specific version of the mapper, after being warned about the possibility of choosing an incorrect one. It is also possible to have a "per mapper" database with the checksums of known roms using a mapper and the appropriate "submapper" may be SUGGESTED to the user at startup as a pre-selected option in a list. It is also possible to take the presence of specific title "keywords" in the title/filename of the rom into account when deciding which version of the mapper to SUGGEST to the player. I hope this makes some sense <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.
