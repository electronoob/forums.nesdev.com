		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi,
<br />
<br />i found a 500in1 game board  in an old piece of crap (a copied NES version which looks like a SNES). The game cart was soldered in it. Now ive unsoldered it and want to put it in a NES Cartridge to play it on nes. Problem: It is a 60pin board. Has someone a tutorial how i need to solder the pins (and maybe a lockout chip (i got one from a old MMC1 game)) to get it working?
<br />
<br />THanks!

<br />
<br />Alternatively there are famicom to NES converters around, even on eBay. The last thing you could do would be to hack apart a NES board and solder from the Famicom 60pin edge to the NES board all the required signals essentially using it as an adapter board. It won't look that pretty. Your best bet is the converter Nintendo used assuming the board will fit inside a cartridge once connected to it.
<br />
<br />Ofcourse you could always just get a Famicom and skip all this.

It was soldered next to the ping connector in the copied nes, ive unsoldered this part and now its a normal famicon cartridge board. i tried to follow the tracks it was soldered to on the board (it was soldered next to a toploader 72 pin connector), but i think there were soldered some pins to a lockout chip that was on the NES board. If you wish i can post pics tomorrow (my gnome is just right now compiling ^^).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If the board you have has a 60 pin edge connector (for Famicom) you need an adapter to plug it into and the other end of the adapter should have a 72 pin edge connector to go into the NES. 
<br />
<br />A pirate/clone NES does not have a lockout chip AT ALL. The board with the 500-in-1 has no lockout chip either. There is no need for it. 
<br />
<br />Really all you are really asking is how do I play a Famicom cartridge on my NES. It's simple, you need an adapter.

If you have access to the original titles (Duck Hunt, Gyromite, Super Mario bros., Hogan's Alley, etc.), look for carts with pins that have a "finger sticking out of their side", as opposed to the common pins that have a prong sticking out of the middle. 
<br />
<br />The common pins look like this:
<br />
<br />|  |
<br /> V
<br />
<br />The ones with an adapter in them look like this:
<br />
<br />|  |
<br />   | 
<br />
<br />There are photos of the pins on this forum somewhere if you need to see them. 
<br />
<br />The ones with the adapter also weigh more, by about 25g. 
<br />
<br />Games like these can be easily bought for &lt;$5 at most game shoppes, so it's not a terrible expense to get one; Cheaper than building a board, IMO.
