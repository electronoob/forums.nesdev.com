<br />I wasn't sure about this myself... so I looked it up on MSDN and apparently the precedence is right (addition operator + has higher precedence than right-shift operator &gt;&gt;) -- in C++ anyway.  I don't know whether or not it's the same in Java.

Did anyone teach you order of operation?<br /><br />I don't think anyone on this forum is going to sit here and write your entire program for you.  Most people here won't sift through lines of actual code, but WILL sift through questions about the 6502 arch, as well as sift through emulator problems that you can describe generally.<br /><br />Meaning: no one has any idea what your variables and structs actually do or what's in them when the code is run, so debugging that piece is entirely your responsibility.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />EDIT: I think you could clear up most of your architecture misconceptions if you took some time to <a href="http://www.65xx.com/wdc/documentation/w65c02s.pdf" class="postlink">read this</a>, though be sure to note it's for the 65C02, so there are some opcodes which the NES does not have (6502 != 65C02).  <a href="http://www.obelisk.demon.co.uk/6502/reference.html#JSR" class="postlink">This</a> might also help you (be sure to read RTS as well).  If none of those make any sense, <a href="http://www.cyberroach.com/analog/an21/boot_camp.htm" class="postlink">try this</a>.</div>

<br />
<br />Me too (I'd never tell this) ! 
<br />The pleasure to make it is MAKE IT.
<br />And about of order of  operation... that's sure I know, you could imagine: "A guy trying to write an emulator... humm that doesn't know this... " :S 
<br />What you think?

<br />Thanks for links. (I realy want help not that someone sit and write the entyre emulator)

<br />The one downside: Standard 6502 asm syntax uses () both for expression grouping and for indirect addressing modes. If you overparenthesize an expression, something that evaluates to lda $45,y becomes lda ($45),y.

<br />I kind of knew you were going to comment on this <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Of course, you must apply your judgment on a case by case basic.  My comment was mostly for high level languages like C/C++/Java/c#/vb/vba etc.  and especially when you have to supervise a group of junior in your company  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />.
