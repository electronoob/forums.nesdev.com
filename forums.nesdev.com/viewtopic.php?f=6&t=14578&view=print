In 2013 I was messing with NotSoFatso but cancelled the project due to lack of time. Now I'm making a 2nd attempt, this time with NSFPlay. I'm well aware that Brad wants to do a GNU/Linux version in the future but I want it now and have too much free time on my hands.<br /><br />Without further ado, let me introduce 2 projects:<br /><a href="https://gitlab.com/ftz/nsf" class="postlink">fTz NSF</a> aka libftznsf - a cross platform library for playing NSF files. This is a direct fork of nsfplay where I'll be removing all platform specific parts and rewriting everything in modern c++. This will be a pure ISO C++ library which you can embed into your application.<br /><a href="https://gitlab.com/ftz/nsf-player" class="postlink">fTz NSF Player</a> a player application using libftznsf.<br /><br />Screenshot of the ncurses version:<br /><img src="https://ftz.fatony.net/projects/nsf/player/player_screen1.png" alt="Image" /><br />Screenshot of the Qt version:<br /><img src="https://ftz.fatony.net/projects/nsf/player/qt_screen1.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://ftz.fatony.net/projects/nsf/player/qt_legacy_config.png" alt="Image" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Not to cause drama (this is not my intention, but rather transparency): this isn't a case of &quot;Brad not wanting to collaborate&quot;, it's a case of <a href="https://github.com/bbbradsmith/nsfplay/pull/3" class="postlink">you not actually understanding what it is you're doing</a> (and even admitting it at one point).<br /><br />When working on an open-source project, keep in mind that making <a href="https://github.com/bbbradsmith/nsfplay/pull/3/commits/a83e8879999e9daaaababc8f2e4c51e5d86b22ad" class="postlink">huge sweeping changes</a> (like you did) are highly shunned.  If you find a bug, fix that bug, then commit those fixes (in a single commit if possible -- if not, then rebase and roll those multiple commits up into one).  If you find another bug, fix that bug, then commit that.  Most authors like if you submit a pull request per bugfix as well.  And accurate commit messages are absolutely mandatory (&quot;Made it compile in GNU/Linux&quot; is not an accurate portrayal of what you did in that commit).<br /><br />What you did in that gigantic commit is... well, let's just say I wouldn't merge those changes through either.  <a href="http://neilb.org/2014/12/31/pr-etiquette.html" class="postlink">This isn't a viewpoint of minority, either</a>.<br /><br />All that said: your efforts to improve something are actually appreciated (yes really!  Do not let my above words make you think otherwise!).  It's just that how you went about it in this case isn't feasible.  For major functional changes <a href="https://github.com/bbbradsmith/nsfplay/pull/3#issuecomment-234629370" class="postlink">like those described</a>, you really need to talk with the maintainer/author first, rather than &quot;just bang out something that works for you&quot;.  This is what actual collaboration is on open-source projects.  Brad is super easy to talk to and accommodating.  That communication could have happened either in a GitHub Issues request (&quot;Hey, I want to do this thing, it would involve me changing X/Y/Z, is that an acceptable approach?  If not, is there middle ground or alternatives available?&quot;), here on nesdev (there is a <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=10299" class="postlink">NSFPlay</a> thread but a separate one would be OK), or even Email.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm happy if someone wants to make a fork that runs on Linux, that in itself is great. I'm actually quite pleased that FaTony is doing this.<br /><br /><br />As for pull requests: If you do want changes to propagate to my &quot;master&quot; branch, though, you've gotta do it in incremental (i.e. single purpose and as small as possible) changes that don't break backward compatibility with current compilers, don't make non-functional changes (e.g. changes of &quot;coding style&quot;), and of course don't cause a regression.<br /><br />FWIW, FaTony did communicate with me through e-mail prior to starting work, but I did explain then that I probably wouldn't want to take those kinds of changes (with a &quot;never say never&quot; clause that I'd review any actual changes presented to me, which I did). I'd still consider changes that met those requirements, but the more non-functional refactoring you do, the less this will be possible. If I can't take your changes without changing compilers and changing coding style, then I'm simply not going to take them.<br /><br />This isn't just a matter of me not liking your style, it's also a matter of making revisions and progressions understandable to everyone using the NSFPlay codebase, which is more than just me and you-- there are multiple forks currently active, not necessarily on github. (Personally I don't like NSFPlay's coding style, but it was inherited from the original maintainer, and I try to follow what's already there and avoid non-functional changes.)<br /><br /><br />My own plan for NSFPlay is to finish my emulation accuracy goals for one more release of NSFPlay 2, and then begin a total rewrite/refactor for NSFPlay 3 that will have cross-platform compatibility in mind from the ground up, instead of trying to find an incremental way to get there from the existing code. I'm not going to work on it for a while, though, certainly not until <a href="http://lizardnes.com/" class="postlink">a more important project</a> is finished.<br /><br />Regardless of whether I take pull requests from it, I love that this fork exists. If you only feel comfortable proceeding with the project in your own style, etc. then that's fine, please continue. I just don't want to give you improper expectations about what can go back into my branch.

Just because code is cross-platform clean doesn't mean it's good code, and vice versa. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

CHANGING COMPILERS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU DO ON A FUCKING WHIM. It has far-reaching consequences, and is a lot of work, and to top it off you're only working on a subset of the codebase (in particular <em>the GUI is MFC</em>)-- are you expecting me to do the work to change the rest of it to build with your favourite compiler?<br /><br />If you just want to break working MSVC code and expect me (<em>and all other current users of the code</em>) to either change compilers or do a bunch of work to &quot;unfix&quot; your changes for MSVC so that I can take your pull request, well... <em>don't expect that.</em>

I may do another pull requests and they will be very small and precise. But I don't think it will be in the near future. Again, I understand that you care about backwards compatibility with MFC etc. I didn't intend to break any public API in my pull request and I think I didn't. Those char[_MAX_PATH] that I've changed to std::string were private afaik.<br /><br />Anyway, I was eager and still am to get stuff done ASAP, that's why I think a full fork will serve it's purpose. I have big plans for it that I'm pretty sure won't match with the goal of nsfplay.
