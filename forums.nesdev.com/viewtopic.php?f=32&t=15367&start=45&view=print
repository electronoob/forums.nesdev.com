		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Looks great. I love that weathered stone layout. Good bit of visual polish there.<br /><br />Just a thought on word choice for the game:<br /><br /><em>Rock, Paper, Scissors</em> is the common grouping that's being referenced, but the term <em>Stone </em>has a more serious connotation (at least in the fantasy genre), but it breaks the parallelism of referencing the children's game.<br /><br />It might be better to choose equivalent terms (and symbols) to replace scissors and paper with as well, such as:<br /><em>Stone, Blade,  Parchment (or Scroll)</em><br /><br />This would make the rock/paper/scissors a little less on-the-nose (more subtly referenced). <br /><br />If an obvious connection is the intention, it might be better to go with <em>Rock </em>instead of <em>Stone </em>to parallel <em>Scissors </em>and <em>Paper</em>.

Consider Zelda 1's map, where you had which screen you were on, but not how terrain would obstruct exploring it (though a moderate amount of the map around the start was &quot;full&quot;-mapped in the manual, with space for you to fill in)

Think of a less extreme version of Metroid or Toejam and Earl's discovery system; in those games, unexplored areas are totally blanked out. Maybe that system would actually work better for this game than you initially expected as well.

The size of the map makes every screen 12x12 pixels which is something hard to work with taking in account you just have 256 patterns. At this point, a crude, not aligned blanking would be the only solution I can think of without having to redesign eveything. And I'm not sure I will be able to get that in time.<br /><br />Taking in account that there's pattern reuse in the minimap, what you propose would be quite a daunting task at the moment. Although I agree that would be great to have such a feature.
