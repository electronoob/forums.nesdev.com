		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the Everdrive would work well for that, since it won't affect the game's timing and the hardware already exists.  The USB drivers make it simple to display ASCII with any terminal program, the trick would be adding that checking/output into the mappers.  The USB chip doesn't come standard on the board (you can order it with it), and the cart shell doesn't have an opening for it, but I wouldn't mind installing a few for people if that's what stopping them.  I have the Famicom Everdrive, haven't bothered to put the USB chip on mine yet.<br /><br />About 72-pin connectors, the 2.5mm pitch ones are difficult to find, but 2.54mm is common and actually works just fine.

My point is, why would you use the expansion port in the first place if what you need to do works even better in the cartridge slot, which's something all systems have? Sounds like pure stubbornness to me.

Detecting the actual address being accessed means that it's going to work for every possible case (increments, zeropage, pointers, indexing) with no chance for false positives.

Several of my WIP projects <em>do</em> see the whole bus, I'm getting a little too used to that luxury, heheh.  One of them is intended for this kind of use, and it certainly is Game Genie-like.  But it seems like it will be forever before I can get it to that point, it's one my bigger projects..

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Both the Everdrive and Powerpak can listen to the entirety of both buses. The major difference between the two is that the Everdrive has to relay (and can bankswitch) PRG A12,11,10, which would be useful for NSF support or some of the rare pirate mappers that use 4K-or-smaller PRG banks; while the PowerPak has to relay (and can bankswitch) CHR A2,1,0 (for MMC5 left-and-right split screen with fine scrolling).<br /><br />There's probably a few other subtle differences, but that's the huge one.<br /><br /><br />Game Genie support is usually achieved by patching the ROM at load time, rather than replacing things at fetch time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, that difference in PRG line output is why I implemented <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES_Mapper_031" class="postlink">mapper 31</a> for Everdrive, but not PowerPak. To get it to work on PowerPak I'd need a custom ROM loader and to cut the available PRG space in half, like its NSF player does.<br /><br />For the matter at hand though, yeah I'm sure it has all the lines it needs. Don't thefox's powermappers work by snooping on controller reads? I'm sure that already proves the concept.<br /><br />I think communicating with the USB without interrupting the CPU for it might be harder to solve, though.

Probably N8 too. I think there are some ambiguous situations when patching at load time, although it'd probably work in most of the cases. <br /><br />(The problem is that, say, in MMC3 there are multiple addresses where a certain bank could be banked in, and there's no way to know which are actually used without running the program. The only protection against patching a wrong byte is the &quot;compare&quot; byte in most Game Genie codes, but it's not fool proof.)
