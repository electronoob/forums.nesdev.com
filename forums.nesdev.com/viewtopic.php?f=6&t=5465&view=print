Remade stage 4-2 of ninja gaiden with famitracker. The files (nsf and ftm) are available in <a href="http://famitracker.shoodot.net/forum/posts.php?id=515&amp;pid=3528" class="postlink">this thread</a>.
<br />
<br />Simple song but I love this one a lot. It was fun to remake.

<br />
<br />All the NG games reuse some music on later stages. Infact in NG2 it would seem to pick random songs for the final level. One thing is for sure about NG music, it sounded better on the NES than it did on the SNES.

<br />
<br />You mean NG2 picks up a random song in the last level, that it won't be the same in a different playtough ? This is SO stupid.

<br />
<br />My goal was to improve my tracking skill and learn how to make some Ninja gaiden music.  So I analyzed the song completely.  This mean I took nsfplay, checked how volumes are used, which note are where, channel by channel, note by note.  So it's not a cover in the sense that I remade it my own way: I reproduced the song to learn more tracking skill.  I hope after remaking a few of them that it will give me a feel on how to make similar song later, my own songs.
<br />
<br />@MottZilla:  I don't remember the song to be random in NG2.  I played it often. You're sure about that?
<br />
<br />As for re-using the songs in the credit, I don't think it was a big deal. The song is so good that you want to hear it again <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />@ccovell:  That could be interesting to remake some of the arcade one on the nes.  It just that I really don't know much about the arcade version actually since I mostly played the nes games only.  Now I want to hear the arcade soundtrack <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

If you have alot of extra lives you can do this quite a bit and you'll cycle through several songs. I know I used to purposely die until I got the music track I wanted.

<br />
<br />As for the arcade version, hmm... It's a mixed bag I guess. It has nothing to do with the nes version. It's more like a double dragon clone but that didn't go well. It's an ok game but the nes version is a lot better.  I listened back to the first level song and it was good.

<br />I haven't tried listening to it on my Megadrive yet, so it's possible that some of the volumes need to be adjusted.
<br />
<br />If you're using in_vgm you can open the plugin config window, go to the YM2612 and SN76489 tabs and increase the preamp value (I've got the YM2612 at 148 and the SN76489 at 161). I don't recommend using the overdrive setting though.

<br />
<br />By the way that VGM version is pretty cool.
