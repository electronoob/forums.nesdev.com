	</div><br />pic 1: Slight difficulty making the jump up the shaft to the direct right of cheril because of headbump into the ceiling. It was there before, but might be slightly more pronounced than before. <br />pic 2: Staying on this moving platform for too long leads to an unexpected dropthrough because it goes too close to the ceiling, which feels a little like a symptom of evil dungeon master/cheap death syndrome. <br />pic 3: slightly difficult jump for what i percieve as the wrong reasons. Same thing as with pic 1. <br />pic 4: extremely difficult jump to make without superpower; however half the trouble is not bumping against a block on the x axis, so i think it was the same before. Here, i think the difficulty might potentially be appropriate for skilled speedrunners. <br />pic 5: not being able to reach here without super power feels a bit cheap, considering the path to get there and that this is the final screen before completing the course. Maybe there should be a stair formation, stepping stone, or &lt;3&lt;3 statue right there?<br /><br />Game is overall slightly easier to play through, but for all the right reasons this time. I feel like i am in control to a much larger extent. <br /><br />The enemy reset fix worked like a charm.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yet another mini-observation: Completing the game and selecting 'continue' afterwards sets the lives to 3 and super power charges to 0 regardless of what you managed to complete the game with<br /><br />And a random thought: The player could feel a sense of accomplishment if the max number of super power charges were increased for every solved puzzle. It would also make the game progressively easier as it stands, so it would be a significant change to the game balance. Besides altering the difficulty curve it would also change the psychological aspect of the player deciding in which order to go for the tokens and temples. &lt;/ rant on hypothetical design &gt;

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Besides correcting some dark spots in the map and moving some enemies, plus changing and adjusting a few bits, as suggested, I've changed the way the game starts.<br /><br />I wish this makes learning the basic gameplay dynamics easier and the game more intuitive.<br /><br />First of all, every interactuable spot where you can press &quot;B&quot; comes with a nice bouncing arrow, so the first thing you see when you start a new game is this:<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
			<img src="./download/file.php?id=8102" alt="image_2017-02-24_14-02-08.png" /><br />
			<span class="gensmall">image_2017-02-24_14-02-08.png [ 10.13 KiB | Viewed 2373 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div><br />(the arrow only appears when you actually can interact. For example, it won't appear over teleporters if you don't have enough charges). <br /><br />Once you use the pedestal and recharge your powers, cheril says something. Just this once, of course:<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
			<img src="./download/file.php?id=8103" alt="image_2017-02-24_13-32-45.png" /><br />

		<br />
	</div><br /><br />The balloon won't go away until your activate your powers, and you need to do so to actually start the game.<br /><br />I have a couple more things to polish before I can post a new (definitive) version. Just wanted to know what you guys think about the changes.

I appreciate the extra effort you're doing post-compo. <br /><br />I'm a little bit concerned with how the thin text (&quot;super powers&quot;) will present itself on hardware; ntsc and pal. Let me know if you want me to test it on PAL. <br /><br />*If* it doesn't hold up, maybe there's a way to formulate something meaningful in fewer letters.

	</div><br /><br />Is there a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography#Map_key_or_legend" class="postlink">key to this map</a>? The icons and walls are hard to see as such, particularly without any color. I figured you couldn't make it any bigger because the territory is 20 by 4 screens. Perhaps if I had a full-scale map of all 80 screens, as might be found on <a href="http://www.vgmaps.com/" class="postlink">VGMaps</a>, as well as what each existing cell represents, I could try figuring out how to design a clearer in-game map.<br /><br />When I include a game in an Action 53 compilation, one of the first steps is to find which address ranges in the game are unused so that the builder can add an exit patch and possibly include other games' compressed CHR ROM and screenshots. Based on my analysis of 1.2, it appears I have about 5 KiB ($B900-$BFFF and $F200-$FFBF) to work with. That's enough for a full pattern table and nametable, even without any compression; if I add compression, it's also enough for several sprites to break up the grid.
