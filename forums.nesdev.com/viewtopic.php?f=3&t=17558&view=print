Well, I finally got my PPU rendering some basic backgrounds (turns out I had a few CPU bugs I didn't realize before (now I'm passing everything in nestest until the first non-standard instruction) and by not turning off rendering when flags were set, scroll code was causing V to get too large). I've attached the screenshots of where I'm at now with Donkey Kong.<br /><br />I figured the extremely experienced devs on here could probably take one look at these attached screenshots and instantly know what problems I should tackle next in my PPU to get it rendering backgrounds decently. My code is here:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/davecom/DDNES">https://github.com/davecom/DDNES</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />Edit: Updated screenshots after fixed off by 1 tile error.

My title screen palette memory matches yours exactly. My attract demo screen is very close, with just the second nibble of a few changes from 0 to F.

Whereas your attract demo palette is:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">0F 15 2C 12&nbsp; 0F 27 02 17&nbsp; 0F 30 36 06&nbsp; 0F 30 2C 24<br />00 02 36 16&nbsp; 00 30 27 24&nbsp; 00 16 30 37&nbsp; 00 06 27 02<br /></div><br />Mine is:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">0F 15 2C 12&nbsp; 0F 27 02 17&nbsp; 0F 30 36 06&nbsp; 0F 30 2C 24<br />0F 02 36 16&nbsp; 0F 30 27 24&nbsp; 0F 16 30 37&nbsp; 0F 06 27 02<br /></div><br /><br />Since the colors are off on both my title screen and my attract screen I am thinking this is not a palette memory issue.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, I'm an idiot. I was pulling each color directly from the NES palette (so limited to 8 colors) instead of first getting the entry from palette memory. As you can see in the attached screenshots, this is fixed now. But now I have some other problems to address, that maybe you have some insight about&#058;<br />Title Screen:<br />- Extra white lines on the right hand side of the letters<br /><br />Attract Demo<br />- The extra light brown line in the first set of barrels<br />- The extra white lines in Donkey Kong himself<br />- The extra red line in the oil barrel<br /><br />What is the most likely cause of extra vertical lines? What's interesting is that they're different colors. I'm guessing a misalignment somewhere in the shift registers?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can't tell you what the problem is, but I'd suggest looking at:<br /><br />a) your drawing routine for pattern table (CHR) data,<br />b) any kind of calculation routine your emulator is using internally for correlating graphics on-screen &lt;--&gt; pattern table (CHR) data,<br />c) the actual CHR data (I doubt this is wrong, since for this game it's all in the ROM itself); make sure the ROM works on other emulators to rule out actual corruption (there are tons of bad ROMs floating around, that's why I gave filename AND MD5 checksum).<br /><br />Honestly to me, it looks like some sort of off-by-one mistake, since it's <s>either the first or</s> last pixel in a tile's scanline.  Edit: it looks like its the last pixel column on some tiles, i.e. the last/far right pixel.<br /><br />For the title screen, the tile that makes up the word &quot;DONKEY KONG&quot; is tile $62 located in the 2nd pattern table.  That may help you.<br /><br />You should really give in and just install/use Wine and get some actual Windows emulators going to help you with analysis.  You'll find FCEUX's debugger, PPU viewer, nametable viewer, and hex editor (to view different parts of memory space, including PPU) to be very helpful.  Stop hemming and hawing over &quot;a pretty UI&quot;, this is low-level work; the UI will be the last of your concerns when it comes to this type of troubleshooting, I can assure you.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@koitsu - thanks for the comprehensive reply. I'll look into it and report back. What's weird is it seems to only affect some tiles. If it was a generalized off by one error, I would expect to see it on almost all of the tiles... I wonder what can be off by one for only some tiles... I'll have to do some investigating.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">You should really give in and just install/use Wine and get some actual Windows emulators going to help you with analysis.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, I figured it out. The problem was that my high tile byte calculations were off by 1 when I was merging them into the shift register for rendering. Apparently a shift by a negative number is undefined in C, so it's a hard error to spot.<br /><br />My old code looked like this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">for (int i = 7; i &gt;= 0; i--) {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; temp_data &lt;&lt;= 4;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; temp_data |= ((low_tile_byte &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; i)) &gt;&gt; i) | ((high_tile_byte &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; i)) &gt;&gt; (i - 1)) | (attribute_table_byte );<br />}<br />tile_data |= temp_data;</div><br /><br />Where tile_data is a 64-bit unsigned integer and temp_data is a 32-bit unsigned integer. Can you spot the error? What happens when i is 0? My new code looks like this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">for (int i = 7; i &gt;= 0; i--) {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; temp_data &lt;&lt;= 4;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; temp_data |= ((low_tile_byte &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; i)) &gt;&gt; i);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; if (i &gt; 0) {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; temp_data |= ((high_tile_byte &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; i)) &gt;&gt; (i - 1));<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; } else {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; temp_data |= ((high_tile_byte &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; i)) &lt;&lt; 1);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; temp_data |= attribute_table_byte;<br />}<br />tile_data |= temp_data;</div><br /><br />That was a subtle bug. Now I'm rendering Donkey Kong backgrounds correctly. Before I move on to sprites, what other Mapper 0 games do you recommend for testing when you have no sprites implemented and no controls implemented? Should I run any of the tests here:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/christopherpow/nes-test-roms">https://github.com/christopherpow/nes-test-roms</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Basically, I'm looking for background only tests.

I could see a LUT being a bit more readable and a bit more performant.
