		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I figured this was the place to ask. I'm trying to figure out where I can get a 72 ping cartridge connector to use in a project. I don't want a replacement connector for a front loading nes.
<br />
<br />From what I've seen finding a connector with the right pitch is the hard part. At this point the only way I can think of to get the connector is to rip apart a game genie or to steal one from a nes clone. Any thought?
<br />
<br />Thanks.

<br />If you read the second page, you'd find that the straight connectors are part of that thread as well, and that other people are looking to find them. I'd like a strong source for them myself.
<br />
<br />If you only need one or a couple, then you can order <a href="http://www.tototek.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=22&amp;products_id=77" class="postlink">these</a>, then cut them down to 36-pins per (chop off 24 pins on each with a rotary tool). Bingo 36+36=72:  A straight-edge 72-pin connector with the correct pitch made from two trimmed 60-pin connectors; net cost: $8 per connector plus freight costs from China.
<br />
<br />Either that, or have them custom made if you need a lot of them; net cost, $3 per connector plus a huge tooling fee (~US$5,500) , minimum 1,000 pieces. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> 
<br />
<br />Also: Please try to be respectful...

<br />
<br />It will be out of alignment though, as the 60-pin is 2.54mm pitch.  Seems like the error would add up too quickly (pins on the cart are fairly wide).

<br />
<br />And i noticed that they have 72 pin connectors available I emailed and asked what the pitch was and they responded that is was 2.54mm. I've asked how much they have tested the kazzo with the 72 pin connector they are using with any luck it still works.
<br />
<br />This is the one he said they use. I looked at the datasheet but I honestly don't know how to read it.

<br /> Would still love to find a proper replacement though without killing a game genie or clone though.

<br />
<br />FYI, 0.04 off pitch is a big cumulative discrepancy, so I see troubled waters...I don't think the Yobo (et al) type clones use a 2.54m pith connector, so they.re out there somewhere and I'll see if I hear back from my suppliers in China after the New year. 
<br />
<br />If I can get them, who will want some and how many pieces do you need? I'd probably be looking at a 100pcs minimum order...

<br />How do you go about measuring the pitch on these connectors? It would be interesting to find out exactly what is being used. I figured worst case scenario is I'll keep an eye out for game genies or really really cheap clones.
<br />
<br />I'll let you know what response I get from the kazzo develepers they are using the 2.54 mm pitch connector but it's very possible that since it's mainly a japanese device they might not notice issues with the nes side of things. Worst case scenario i figure is I will have to use my converter that came with my famicom clone.... or here's a thought I'll pull the connector out of that

<br />
<br />You can also use something of a known pitch to measure against, like another connector, or a PCB with pre-drilled holes (they make vero in a variety of pitch scales). The problem comes in with nonstandard stuff, where you need absolute accuracy: This is one of those items, but for most stuff, you can just eye it and know what it wants... I could use an analogue micrometer if I was hard-up for a measurement, but I'm not sure I'd trust any non-industrial ruler made int he past 25 years to be anywhere near accurate. 
<br />
<br />My old drafting tools though, are quite another matter: They may be analogue, or I may need a loupe to see the markings, but they're spot-on. I used cheap tools to measure the NESpander connectors on my first run-through of having them moulded, which is why they turned out wrong: Stupid mistake, and I should know better.

<br />He tested Nes dumping and said that he didn't have a single nes game he wasn't able to dump. So I think I will take the plunge and order a few soon and let you know how it all turns out.

After seeing this picture I opened up my Retro Duo to see if perhaps the clones do in fact just make do with 2.54mm slots. The pins don't line up exactly in a retro duo either.

<br />
<br />The picture is blurry but hopefully it's clear enough to see. Perhaps the clones do use a 2.54mm slot. Of course I'd want to see more evidence before I plugged up a PowerPak in a slot I knew was 2.54mm.
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT: Ok I couldn't resist. I bought a couple from digikey. I'll see how things line up.
