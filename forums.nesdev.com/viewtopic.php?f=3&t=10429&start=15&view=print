Also the window to write commands is rather small (the command processor will time out if you take too long to write data).<br />All BS-X flash commands are implemented (timing is not). Lock bits are implemented but are reset each time the BS-X is loaded.<br />SPC7110 decompression is based off Neviksti's original code.

This emulator does not even have a proper full screen support yet which is a shame because this emulator have more than a decade in development. It would be nice to also be able to customize the hotkeys and have rewind support.<br /><br />I understand that you're coding this emulator in your free time and you probably don't want this emulator to replace the other powerhouses like Snes9X, Nestopia, puNES, etc... (yet) but the majority of users needs a good reason to use this emulator over the other ones. At this point I can't find any good reason to use this emulator over the ones I mentioned.<br /><br />My comment sounded rude but it was actually a constructive criticism.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Which Super Scope games need offscreen firing? I know games in the tradition of <em>Lethal Enforcers</em>, <em>Area 51</em>, and <em>Time Crisis</em> use firing offscreen to reload the gun. But fire far enough offscreen, and the Super Scope's IR sensor won't pick up the Fire button press.<br /><br />Offscreen firing is more common with the NES Zapper, and emulators have traditionally bound the right mouse button to fire offscreen. But then menus in Zapper games tend to use offscreen for Select and onscreen for Start. And there doesn't need to be a second button reserved for Cursor because it behaves as if the Cursor button is always held, sending a vertical coordinate whenever pointed at anything bright enough.

Yes, I'm a bit picky but please understand that these are basic features that early emulators already had, these type of features is what attract most users. Sorry if I sounded rude again, it was not my intention.<br /><br />Regarding the off-screen firing, this can be resolved with a &quot;Off-Screen Firing&quot; hotkey. Save States is also an important feature that most emulators have.<br /><br />Regarding the rewind feature, this is an excellent feature that will also attract users, at this point I don't think I will ever use a Snes or Nes emulator lacking that feature. Hell, I was still using the outdated Zsnes because of it. I recently moved to Snes9X because they finally added that feature. Being able to rewind a couple of seconds (10-15 secs) is good enough for me. Other users will probably want it longer though.<br /><br />Regarding the hotkeys, being able to customize the emulator to your liking also attracts users IMHO, it makes the user feel like the emulator is part of him (yeah, it sounds cliché). This is a feature that I wish every emulator in existence had already, Snes9X is doing this part perfectly. This is another reason why I use Snes9X. Featurewise, Snes9X is the perfect Snes emulator.<br /><br />Again, thank you for your hard work. I know you're busy, hopefully you can have time to add those features little by little, you don't need to add it all at once, I don't want you to feel pressured or anything. I rarely visit this forum but I took my time to write about this because I see a lot of potential in this emulator.
