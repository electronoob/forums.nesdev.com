		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, I had the idea to make a NES homebrew which honors the Angy video game nerd. 
<br />Unfortunately I am no good in 6502 Assembler but well skilled in drawing pixelart and doing concepts.
<br />I´m looking for someone who would like to do that homebrew with me.
<br />I already started some sort of a concept to show you that I am serious about working on that project.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">1.	Basic Stuff<br /><br />1.1.	What is this Project about? <br />	This is going to be a project, to create a Videogame which honours the “Angry <br />	Video Game Nerd” Series by James Rolfe.<br />	<br />1.2.	Technical Information:<br />	The Game will be a NES Homebrew and will be written in 6502 Assembler<br />	language.<br />	<br />1.3.	Staff Requirement:<br />	At least we need a Programmer, a Graphic-Artist and an Sound-Artist.<br /><br /><br />2.	Story<br /><br />2.1.	First Draft:<br />	The Nerd finds an unknown Video-Game and puts it in his System. When the <br />	Game starts it absorbs the Nerd into the Game.<br />	Now the Nerd has to beat the Game by himself to return to the real world.<br />	<br /><br />3.	Graphics<br /><br />3.1.	Inspirations:<br />	This Image is a good example for what the<br />	Box/ Starting Screen and Cutscenes <br />	could look like. <br />	<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />	Bernard from Maniac Mansion could be a Raw model<br />	for the Ingame-Charakter but he has to look more<br />	aggressive.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />4.	In-Game Information<br /><br />4.1.	Weapons/ Attack abilities:<br /><br />	Fist: Firstly the Nerd can only use his fist to fight off the enemies, but he can<br />	        find extra weapons like the following.<br />	<br />	Power Glove: The Power Glove is a item that gives you more power for you<br />	                         fist attacks (You can also se the nerd wearing the glove)<br />	<br />	NES-Zapper:  The Zapper is the classic fireweapon in this game.<br /><br />	NES-Controller: The Controller is like a whip. <br /><br />	The Nerd-Scream: There is a angriness-bar which fills up during the game.<br />	                                 When it is full of angriness the Nerd can resolve the Nerd<br />	                                 Scream which is the most powerful attack in the game.<br />	<br />4.2.	Enemies:<br />	The Enemies from games, the Nerd already tested would fit good into this <br />	game, maybe the Bosses could be Heroes from this crappy games, so the final<br />	boss would be E.T. from the Atari Game.<br />	<br />4.3.	Some ideas about Bosses:<br />	E.T: One of the bosses or even the main boss could be E.T.. There is a mystery <br />                                about the Atari game, which tells, that Atari buried thousands modules of<br />                                the E.T game in the desert because the game was so crappy.<br />                                So the E.T stage should be a desert, so that the Nerd fights this “game” in                                                                                <br />                   its own grave.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />----TO BE CONTINUED-----<br /></div>

<br />And IIRC, AVGN links to all PC games and fun programs made by fans so I doubt he'd NOT want it.
<br />
<br />
<br />I was thinking of this too, but meh, not my kinda thing. Good luck finding a programmer! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />True. Programmers rarely decide to realize other people's visions, specially when said people say that they can do X and Y but never really get to. Showing what you can do right from the start is a great way to stand out.

<br />I don't think Simon Belmont is anywhere near as narcissistic in the <em>Castlevania</em> games as he is in <em>Captain N</em>, which also uses the "sucked into a video game" trope. But then the <a href="http://www.chapelofresonance.com/articles/captainn.html" class="postlink">constant out-of-character writing</a> by writers who apparently <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidNotDoTheResearch" class="postlink">did not do the research</a> is part of what makes <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ptitle3ivuu2yj" class="postlink"><em>Captain N</em></a> so bad it's good to some viewers.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />IMO, a more interesting idea than sucking the Nerd into a game would be the exact opposite: bring the game stuff out of the carts into the Nerd's world. After years of abuse, his cartridge collection decides to seek revenge, so all the characters/enemies pop out of the carts and start to slowly dominate the Nerd's world, making it look like game levels. Of course, now we end up with another cliche: saving the world. =)

<br />
<br />Unless one could be a major contributor to the project, I would just rather do things my own way.  Learning how to do a scrolling game is all I'd really have to do, but I think I have a good idea on how to approach it.
<br />
<br />I'm going to see James at Magfest 9 (most likely he will be there) and ask for his blessing.  I think it's very important that he'd be behind the project more than anything.
<br />
<br />But I'm not going to be attempting any work on the matter until BK2 is done.  Must focus on one project at a time after all.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /> 
<br />
<br />But still, I guess anyone who's serious about trying it should go ahead.  Just get James's permission to use his name and likeness first.  That is important.

<br />
<br />I would seriously doubt it.  Besides, it's fair use.  One can do a commentary/criticism on things.
