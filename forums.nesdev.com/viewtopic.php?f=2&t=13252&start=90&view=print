The &quot;color&quot; as a TV receives it is defined by the luma and chroma. So if you make a low-pass filter with a corner frequency anywhere between 4.2 MHz (the standard corner for RF) and 10 MHz, you'll end up finding Super NES colors that generate the same <em>sine</em> waves as NES colors after filtering.

Next step is to feed the output of this algorithm into a software PAL/NTSC decoder... one with user adjustable realtime brightness/contrast/colour/tint controls.<br /><br />Colours don't look right?  Do what you did with your old TV and just play with the settings until it does.<br /><br />The thing is, even I know that this is a rather steep task to perform.  Hell, take the C64 emulation scene, the correct PAL colour values have been known for years (the pepto palette, derived from the workings of the VIC-II) but people still complain.  VICE64 and other emulators implement proper PAL emulation so colour mixing tricks and other GFX techniques can be displayed properly, but people complain about the image not looking 'sharp and pixely'.  They say that the colours look too washed out, while ignorant to the fact that the saturation can be turned up in the emulator just like you would turn up the colour knob on your telly.<br /><br />Which brings me to the argument about the designer's opinions on the colours.  Back in the day, most TV sets were adjusted with easy to reach, quick to turn controls.  It would be easy for one person to adjust a TV to his or her liking, only for the next person to come along to set it to their preferences.  For all we know, Miyamoto could have had the colour dial on his TV all the way to the max and could have thought that everybody else's TVs were dull looking.

The problem is that not all TVs are adjusted the way you remember, and not all decoders in all makes and models of TV operate exactly the same. They may differ in their strategy to reduce the appearance of dot crawl or in their nonlinear hue warping to enhance skin tones. How many TV models do we want to emulate?<br /><br />The point of comparing filtered composite output to that of the Super NES S-PPU is that the S-PPU is also capable of producing RGB at the same pixel rate and nonstandard scanline length as the NES. So if your video processing chain distorts NES video in a certain manner, it ought to be distorting Super NES video in the same way.

The SNES PPU outputs analog RGB which is converted to an NTSC or PAL signal by a separate encoder chip. The encoder is an off-the-shelf part, not a Nintendo custom, and different production runs of SNESes used different chips. And on top of that there are various resistors and capacitors between the PPU and the encoder and between the encoder and the multi-out jack, which introduces even more variability due to tolerances, aging, etc. on each of those components.<br /><br />And even if you decide that the NTSC encoder in your SNES contains special Nintendo pixie dust, you still can't make it output &quot;the same voltages&quot; as a NES. The NES PPU outputs square waves, whereas proper NTSC encoders output sine waves. And many of the NES colors are more saturated than anything an RGB-to-NTSC encoder can output (not coincidentally, those are the colors that vary the most between TVs) You can program the SNES palette to RGB(31, 0, 0) and it's <em>still not as red</em> as the NES color $06.

And even then, that should really just come down to a little variation in net hue rotation, net brightness, or net saturation.</div>Here is a morsel of evidence for this phenomenon.<br /><br />Attached please find find a raw capture of the output of a Sharp Twin Famicom (model AN-505BK), sampled at eight times the color burst frequency (28.6363.. MHz). They were made with an older Hauppage ImpactVCB card, for which custom drivers are available (credit to reengine) that allow getting the raw, undecoded signal, before the card or its drivers mess with it.<br /><br />This particular game scene has color 0xC (&quot;cyan&quot;) in all four levels in sufficiently large horizontal areas to allow measuring the phase at all four levels. If the color burst/color 0x8 is at 180 degrees, then color 0xC is nominally at 300 degrees.<br /><br />The archive also includes the output of my custom NTSC decoder as a .BMP file. I configured it to use the sync amplitude as a reference for overall signal gain, which makes the entire image brighter while clipping the 3x colors a bit in the RGB colorspace.<br /><br />The phases of color 0xC that I actually measure (using the unclipped YIQ signal) are:<br /><br />0x0C: 298.565552<br />0x1C: 292.832520<br />0x2C: 288.335663<br />0x3C: 285.327179<br /><br />That's quite a considerable a difference of almost 15 degrees between the reference and the brightest version of the color. All four levels were measured within the same horizontal line (147 in the .BMP file).<br /><br />Since the shift increases with brightness and not with saturation, then assuming I understand what has been written in this thread correctly, it is not slew rate effects (saturation) that matter, but output impedance (level).<br /><br />At least some game programmers must have had this in mind. For example, the Combat screen in Fire Emblem Gaiden normally uses colors $16 and $26 for the enemy stats panel. If the enemy is almost defeated, the panel goes dark, but instead of going to colors $06 and $16, it goes to colors $05 and $16, exactly what one would do to account for a phase shift between the brightness levels.<br /><br />This phenomenon should not be observed with a PAL console, as the PAL system is specifically designed to difference out such differential phase shifts. Instead, the 3x colors become more desaturated compared to a NTSC system adjusted to similar phase and baseline saturation. This matches my observation of the PAL NES' picture.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />According to my results, the phase shift seems to be not constant for all the phases within one of the four levels either. I measure color $31 at 319.9 degrees (nominal: 330), or a shift of 10.1 degrees, and color $36 at 113.1 degrees (nominal: 120), or a shift of just 6.9 degrees. I'm hoping that I'm just doing something wrong, because it would really be annoying and unfortunate if that were true. (This is from the same setup as the other captured image. I'll do the alternative methods once I have a flash cartridge that allows me to upload and run a program that displays, and allows me to capture, all colors at once.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Do you have a flashcart? If so, it would make things much easier if you just use either <a href="https://github.com/christopherpow/nes-test-roms/tree/master/full_palette" class="postlink">Blargg's Full Palette</a> demo or anything else where I can identify specific color by definition/position rather than having to cross-reference it to a picture?<br /><br />I should probably do this same matlab graph on the previous oscilloscope log of HardWareMan's Dendy.
