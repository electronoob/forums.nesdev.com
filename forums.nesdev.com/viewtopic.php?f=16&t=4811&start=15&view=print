<br />
<br />naturally.  The extension offers a pretty wide range of admin definable functions to restrict use, and it prevents things like infinite loops and the like from hogging the server. 
<br />
<br /> But it's definitely not something most wikis need.. it was more just a suggestion since there would be a fair amount of programmers on the site

<br />I'm thinking we should just put the entire new work under the <a href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/zlib_license.html" class="postlink">zlib license</a>. That would solve the following problems:
<br />
<br />The GNU Free Documentation License, used by Wikimedia Foundation's Wikipedia project, isn't designed for code samples because it has requirements that are incompatible with free software licenses. For this reason, the license text recommends dual-licensing all code samples under some free software license. There are also practical problems with the GNU FDL, such as the requirement to include a copy of the entire ilcense with any short quotation from a work. See also an <a href="http://people.debian.org/~srivasta/Position_Statement.xhtml" class="postlink">essay about the license by a Debian contributor</a>.
<br />
<br />Creative Commons CC-BY and CC-BY-SA, used by Wikimedia Foundation's Wikinews project, are incompatible with GNU GPL and GNU FDL because of the "remove from the Collection any credit" requirement in the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode" class="postlink">text</a> of each of these licenses.

<br />
<br />I just read the license.  It quite simple but there is one thing I would like to clarify. Let say for example that I decide to use a code sample of a few line that just init the memory.  Because of the license, I have to but that header in the file it was inserted or just keep it in it's own file separated (init code + license) so to make the management of it easier?  
<br />
<br />Isn't there any way to just put a reference to the license and author of the code or something similar in a readme instead?  I just don't like "licence wart" everywhere in a code base. In many case of open source code, there is more information about the license in every file than comment regarding the code...

<br />
<br />I think that part says you have to remove credit only if the person contacts you asking you to do so, which seems fair imo.
<br />
<br />
<br />I think most code on the wiki should be 100% free with no restrictions unless the individual author specifies a license.  
<br />
<br />really though, does anyone who is planning on contributing to the wiki have the resources and desire to pursue legal action if a license is violated?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Man, come on. The system that we develop for is OLD AS HELL. Why does anyone give a shit what kind of license there is for anything that we do?.... seriously. I mean, sure, acknowledge if you get some help (a la music engine or something similar) in the credits or something, but in the end, why the hell does it matter what kind of license there is on code snippets or something? Do people feel _that_ freaking small that they have to be mentioned in anything that is so closely related to their code? I'm serious as shit. Quit being so shallow about this whole NES development thing. Sure, we all do our fair share of coding and such, but if there is something that works well for what we do, then I'm in the mindset of "just use it." I mean, what we dev for is a tough enough system to program for, given the RAM limits and what-not.
<br />
<br />At one time (not too long ago) I was concerned that there were people grabbing code and making a buck off of it. I've come to the realization, though, that in the end it doesn't make a fuck what people do with this old system, because just the _fact_ that people still want to program for it is damned awesome. You know, most of us wouldn't know what the hell to do with the NES if it weren't for disassembling some of the older games in the first place...
<br />
<br />Anyway, if there is _any_ kind of license put forth on (yet another wiki, much like a project that keeps getting recoded over and over) the wiki, then I seriously think the best license is something I saw another poster on this board talk about at one time:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/">http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />If there is anyone that objects to this, then yes, have them point to their own website with their own license talking about it, but keep it off of the nesdev wiki. If people _really_ care that much about their own code for this defunct system, then I personally feel like they have issues, and should keep their own code to themselves and not contribute to this community anyway.
<br />
<br />We are here to have fun, and program for an architecture that is outdated. Man, WHO CARES what license there is in the end???? This really, REALLY shouldn't be an issue. Just have fun, people. Quit being 'worry warts'.... HAVE FUN DOING WHAT WE DO!

<br />
<br />I think the content of the wiki should be public domain. This is what I was looking for but forgot about the concept. There should be no string attached and I agree with Roth completely. If the user doesn't want it to be that way then it should be on their own site.
<br />
<br />The site should contains code samples and not complete application so it should not be a problem.  If some application (ex: Blargs blip api) is mentioned, there will be a link to the owner site and the application will have it's own license.  That way, I don't see any problems.
<br />
<br />Game are still sold but <strong>how many</strong> anyway and how much money are they making on the back of the information they took?  And after reading Roth message, what is the purpose of that license, an ego boost?  People should be free to use the information to their heart content.  People that really care will mention where they took the information and write the names of the person concerned.  People that are pirates will rips off the information without even mentioning anything so what will really that license bring?
<br />
<br />Let's stop the bureaucratic crap and let get the ball rolling.
<br />
<br />Edit: 
<br />
<br />Tepples, you want to be an admin?  We could just start the wiki together then?  I can try to spare some of my time when I'm available.

<br />Yes, except there's no public domain for any current works, so the closest is something like the modified BSD license, the zlib license that tepples linked to, etc. The advantage of these licenses is that they require modified works to be identified as such, so that we don't have the problem of people making their own versions of the Wiki material that isn't clearly not part of it, thus confusing others as to what the primary, reliable source is.
<br />
<br />Anyone have a problem with the zlib license?
