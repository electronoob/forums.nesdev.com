I wonder...a couple months ago, I turned on the NES and accidentally bridged a connection with the big ol' metal thing that goes over everything. Bluish smoke that smelled like burning solder arose from the metal box that houses the RF modulator/AV out. I immediately unplugged it. A couple days later, I dropped a screw on the NES PCB and a spark resulted from that. Could that be related to the issues?
<br />
<br />Ah, well. Guess I'll test it out on another NES this weekend...

If not, somebody should mention loopy's VRC6 mapper to bunnyboy, so that he could consider including the audio resistor in future revisions of the PowerPak.  It would also be a good idea to include the third-party mappers in the mapper bundle, assuming licensing allowed for it.

I'm sure Bunnyboy is still around as he updated his website with the latest PowerPAK files that included adding Loopy's FDS support and the NSF support. Not sure why the VRC6 wasn't in there other than maybe the timing of its release maybe.

<br />
<br />another option is drilling a hole in your nes, putting in a variable resistor, attaching a cool looking knob, and then saying to people at shows, who ask "Oh this?  It's my VRC6 mix knob, let's me control the power of my VRC6... oh your NES can't play VRC6?  weird.. mine not only can play VRC6, but i can vary its POWER!" (cue wind machine, release of doves)

<br />
<br />well, i guess bridge pin 54 on the 72 pin side to pin 45 (i think) on the 60 pin side.  Pin 45 (i think, double check this) is "audio in" for the famicom.
<br />
<br />there's definately a pin diagram comparison on nesdev somewhere, but it would be a real sinch to bridge them with that converter pictured.
<br />
<br />
<br />try bridging them with no resistor, just a PVC jacketed wire (no cut legs from old resistors or leds, to avoid a contacting any other pin), and if the famicom's internal audio circuit doens't seem to make the vrc the right volume, then try it again with a resistor.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well I got some 100k ohm resistors. Radioshack did have them. I'll have to solder one in when I get time to do so. Can't wait to check out the VRC6 audio on the NES.
<br />
<br />Edit: I soldered a resistor in like Loopy did. It works. Sounds pretty good to me but I haven't tested it extensively yet. But you definitely have the sound channels in the VRC6 as I tested without it first and the music was noticably missing notes but afterwards it sounds like it should, or atleast it sounds similar to what I hear in Nestopia.

<br />
<br />I have tried it with a variety of NSF players, and it sounds WAY more poppin in my nes.. 
<br />
<br />i mean, literlaly, precussive... just POW POW POW 
<br />
<br />
<br />anyone elsE?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some NSF players ignore $4011 writes before sample plays in order to sound "better" than the NES in the player author's opinion. If a song is played in the context of a game, then the last sample of the last song would have left $4011 at some value, and NSF players don't know what value to use when starting the new song so that the user doesn't hear a big ass ugly click whenever a song starts. It's a similar principle to "clickless mixing" in some mod players.
<br />
<br />Another issue is that you might be listening through different speakers. Try running the NES into your stereo, or the PC into your TV.
<br />
<br />Another issue might relate to the NES's analog path, but I have no idea how to test that.
