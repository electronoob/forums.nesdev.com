<br />
<br />Someone pitched an idea in the ZSNES IRC channel a long time ago that movies (save states + input logs) should be used to greatly reduce the memory and performance overhead of the game rewinding feature in some NES &amp; SNES emulators.
<br />
<br />Traditionally, it is implemented using only a save state stack (taking a single save state for every frame of video) and some compression to reduce the memory usage, but that only hampers performance even more than usual.
<br />
<br />The idea is that movies be used to expand into a handful of metaframes (for example, 4 frames), thus dividing the actual memory usage by that amount.  The emulator might load up the movie, play through it real quick with audio and video output and any speed caps disabled, taking a save state each frame into a temporary buffer, then selecting the appropriate state.
<br />
<br />Anyone have any other ideas on how to reduce the overhead of game rewinding (and subsequently, increase the frame rate due to less resources used) without simply adding better compression methods? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I know some people don't like it but it's become a pretty standard feature...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />blargg and others had a discussion on this a while back.  And I believe blargg even implimented such a rewinder in his emu that had a full framerate, complete with reversed audio playback and "matrix-style" slowdown as it was called.
<br />
<br />The concept as I remember it is:
<br />
<br />1) savestate at key times.  Invervals of X frames.
<br />2) record a backlog of audio output (in blocks of X frames)
<br />3) movie data to fill in the gaps between savestates (of X frames)
<br />4) small stack (X) of still screenshots
<br />
<br />When you rewind, you load the previous savestate, and begin playing back the movie while generating new screenshots and audio data -- however none of this is output to the user -- instead... while you're generating that data, you're feeding back the previous screenshots and audio in reverse order.
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />
<br />The catch to this is that you need to have a rocksolid movie system.  Movie desyncing would be fatal.  And IIRC, many SNES emus seem to stuggle with movies for some strange reason.
<br />
<br />ZSNES in paticular, in my experience, has been so flakey with movies that the whole feature is pretty much worthless.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here's a summary of how QuickNES does it (Mac-only at the moment):
<br />
<br />QuickNES movies are implemented by storing controller input for each video frame along with periodic "keyframes" of the full emulated NES state. This allows seeking to any frame in a movie by restoring the most recent keyframe before the desired frame and then replaying the controller input until that frame. This is very similar to the <a href="http://stream.uen.org/medsol/digvid/html/6C_qualityofcompression.html" class="postlink">format of most video codecs</a>, where the controller input corresponds to inter-frame differences.
<br />
<br />Keyframes are currently stored every 30 seconds, chosen based on the tradeoff between memory usage/file size and worst-case seek time. Keyframes can also be placed at specific places to speed seeking, for example to named time markers. Since keyframes use a significant amount of space, a movie file's data is compressed on disk using zlib and in memory using an extremely fast custom compression algorithm.
<br />
<br />When playing or recording a movie, a two-minute cache is kept of recent keyframes at a one second interval. This allows faster seeking to recent footage and is essential for implementing the backwards playback mode.

<br />How hard would it be to actually implement this as a decoder for QuickTime?
