<br />Yes, different segments might work, but if I'm not mistaken, you'd still be missing a time stamp then.
<br />One other option I was thinking of was loading the whole banks into one single segment, neglecting segment registers but then a 1:1 cdl:prg mapping would be possible at least. But the m6502 uses absolute addressing, right? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />Are you talking about the fact, that in the case of code like this...
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">JSR $8123<br /></div>
<br />...IDA wouldn't know which segment 8123 refers to?
<br />
<br />Yeah, this can't be handled with CDL alone... we'd need some other kind of log which tells what bank was mapped at 8000-xxxx at the time of the JSR.

<br />
<br />Yes, exactly! I think I'll just change the current IDA script into a CDL file viewer which supports highlighting, allows the user to interactively switch banks and apply CDL information to the disassembly (similar to the "bankswitch" plugin that comes with nespackage.zip).
<br />Thanks a lot for your help and feedback so far, keep it coming <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />as a flags byte from a CDL file has got a spare, unused bit: what about using it for determining whether the underlying byte is the beginning of an instruction? if the underlying byte has the "code" or "indirect code" flags set, set the new bit if the instruction is the beginning of an instruction, otherwise clear the flag. this will make it easier for subsequent attempts in correctly disassembling the code (i.e. where to start disassembling).

<br />
<br />Yeah sounds like a good idea.
<br />
<br />I'm trying to come up with other improvements as well... for example for instructions such as LDA abs,x it might be useful to keep track of the possible values of X (so abs can be marked as a table with known size). If you or anybody has any ideas for that lmk.
<br />
<br />I hope at some point this can be turned into a tool that allows disassembling bankswitching ROMs in IDA with as little manual work as possible.

<br />
<br />personally, I'd prefer having to manually improve the disassembly rather than having to play through the whole game in order to achieve a complete coverage, but these new CDL features would help instructing IDA where to begin disassembling and might even help in determining when bank switching happens. I'm trying to think of more features. Looking forward to eCDL <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
