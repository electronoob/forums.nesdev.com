Since it is still not out yet I could always drop them a line about the concern of the community.<br /><br />As for the amount available, understood!  I think it was popular in Japan long time ago because I remember they were selling it at used store in Akihabara <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

Rather, they wear the NMOS logic in the console slowly. It's a bit like smoking. Any one cigarette doesn't kill immediately, but it is still bad for your health, and fatality may vary - when and if. A shorter life span is still statistically probable. <br /><br />I'm sorry for the cold shower this might be, but opening it is the only way to know for sure. Photographing the board for a review by the EE savvy people here may help if it's your first time identifying parts and traces. <br /><br />A technical explanation can be found here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://db-electronics.ca/2017/07/05/the-dangers-of-3-3v-flash-in-retro-consoles/">https://db-electronics.ca/2017/07/05/th ... -consoles/</a><!-- m --><br />There was a discussion going on on the forums some time ago about the boards inside Quest Forge.<br /><br /><br />Ps. Cool to see you back on here!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The boards for Columbus Circle's first cartridge, 8-bit Music Power, were not just modern pirate quality boards, they failed in more official systems than they worked in.  The board I linked to had no translation Their next release, Kira Kira Star Night DX worked in pretty much any Nintendo-made system but had iffy luck with the Sharp-released stuff.  I do not know if the situation further improved with their next releases, 8-bit Music Power Final and NEO Heiankyo Alien, but I know they were still using 3.3v flash with Kira Kira.  <br /><br />Ultimately, the architecture of the NES makes it rather unattractive for level translators.  Assuming they use 5v parts for the mapper, you still need translators for the two chips.  That's 15 address lines and 8 data lines for the PRG-ROM and and 13 address lines and 8 data lines for the CHR-RAM (Mapper 2).  So unless they are using three 16-line voltage converters, they aren't implementing 3.3v properly without them.  Current limiting resistors aren't good enough.

The main thing that converters usually get wrong (4-screen or other unusual mirroring) isn't something that Battle Kid does. I don't have the Famicom cart to test, though, but from my experience almost everything works anyway.

In the long run, however, parts may begin to fail, and the evil part about all this is that most people won't even think that these carts were to blame, since they may have worked fine for a long time.
