The strength of the jailbars seems to vary somewhat randomly from machine to machine, so far as I've seen with Famicom AV mods anyway.

One downside here is that the comparison of a top loader or original Famicom is affected by the RF output.  A basic AV mod will show prominent jailbars, but judging by the NES and the Twin Famicom, if Nintendo wanted AV output in these RF-only systems, it would have used a less noisy video path.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> — Wed Jan 21, 2015 8:06 am</p><hr />

If I had to rate the various official NES and Famicom variants by picture quality without any modifications, I would rate the systems as follows :<br /><br />1  Famicom Titler - Supports S-Video, but uses RGB 2C03/2C05 CPU, leading to some incompatibilities.<br />2.  Famicom AV - Supports Composite Video output, no jailbars can be seen<br />3.  NES Front Loader, probably the Sharp NES/Famicom TVs, maybe the Twin Famicom - minor jailbars can be seen occasionally, if you know what to look for.<br />4.  NES Top Loader and probably original Famicom - RF only, prominent jailbars.<br /><br />Can anyone shed more light on the Japanese consoles (except for the Famicom AV)?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> — Thu Jan 15, 2015 10:02 pm</p><hr />
