	</div><br /><br />Some new features to the new and improved engine are:<br />- AI<br />- Status Bar<br />- Better jumping physics<br />- Better background collision detection and resolution<br />- Different background collision properties ( An example of this is in the water area of the demo wher the water makes you fall slower and some of it moves you to the right as if there is a current).<br /><br />If anyone wants to pop open an emulator hex editor mess around with things like background collision and AI during run time here are some memory locations and info:<br /><br />$0700-$071A = AI Memory <br />Each AI is 9 bytes in size: y,x,sprattributes,sprite#,Health,xVel,yVel,Action,Frame<br />The action byte, for those who are wondering, basically controls which action &quot;script&quot; is jumped too in the global AI action jump table.<br />(0 = do nothing, 1 = move left and right, 2 = move up and down, 3 = move in a Zig zag wave, 4 = move in a sine wave)<br />$0600-$06FF = Background Collision table<br />Setting bit 7 makes a tile solid, setting bit 0 makes the tile water-like (more resistance to movement than air), bit 1 makes the tile move the player to the right, bit 2 to the left.<br /><br />When you load the ROM the screen will start black, just press start to begin ( it's in the &quot;menu&quot; state and I haven't really implemented a basic menu/title screen yet). Controls are pretty much like any other platformer on the NES d-pad to move left and right and a to jump. Pressing start and select currently modify the action byte of one of the AI's because I was doing some tests. Lastly when you go to the screens right of the starting area, which ultimately go nowhere, you'll notice the graphics are all messed up. That is intentional and not a glitch as I was testing to see if my tileset swapping between different screens functions correctly.<br /><br />So yeah enjoy I guess!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hmm... I dunno, are you looking for feedback?<br /><br />I'd like to know what kind jump physics you're going for. Currently it seems you're after a jetpack type movement, because it's reversed from a typical jump.<br /><br />Edit: HAH! I read the rest of the topic. Jetpack style it is. Still, I might slow it down a tad for a more jetpack feel. Possibly take a look at the Yoshi's Island flutter mechanics. I've also managed to kind of hover by mashing A, which supports that the player has a jetpack, but it's very difficult to do this, if this is meant to be a mechanic and not a glitch.<br /><br />If you hold A button while pressing start, you can just kinda chill in the air. <br />Edit: Oh, I maybe found out why. $0434 seems to be in charge of how much time is left to hover. At reset it decrements from 0 and wraps through $FF. So you can't float indefinitely as I first thought. Just for a very long time.<br /><br />Similarly, holding left against walls while a new screen loads allows you to jump off walls. (Jump off the pit in the start while holding left+A. The screen you should fall on allows you to go back up to the first screen, but then you fall to the second screen etc.) Holding down while landing allows you to hover a pixel off the ground. I assume you've begun a crouching state that causes this, since it also prevents you from jumping.<br /><br />Not bad progress, though.

I fixed the bug where you can jump off walls and woops I accidentally left some old code in my d-pad down routine (it isn't supposed to do anything) <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />. I haven't been able to replicate the floating via holding start and A yet.

I'm doing just that in FCEUX,Jnes and Nestopia and everything is functioning as intended; no hovering. Just to be on the safe side though I'll make sure when the game changes state that it clears the controller input byte and resets all the jumping related bytes.
