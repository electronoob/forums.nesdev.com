I'm curious about this as well (what _Bnu asked).  I'm also curious how the mapper would know how to increment based on CPU cycles.<br /><br />I thought "maybe there's some kind of crystal on all the N106 boards, which is identical in frequency to the CPU, so the counter increments at the same rate?" but that doesn't seem to be the case:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=8570">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=8570</a><!-- m --><br /><br />How does this actually work?

Would anyone happen to know exactly what happens when a write is performed to either one of this mapper's IRQ registers? I mean, aside from acknowledging it, does it reset the IRQ counter?

Mapper controls disable only mapper interrupts, just as $4010 disables APU DMC interrupts and $4017 disables APU frame counter interrupts.<br /><br />Let me try to explain what the programmer sees, whether the IRQ is fired by the APU or by the mapper:<br /><br />CLI sets the CPU's interrupt priority (I flag) to 0; SEI sets it to 1. When something "fires an IRQ", and the interrupt priority is 0, the CPU pushes the old priority, sets the priority to 1, and calls the interrupt service routine (ISR) that $FFFE-$FFFF points to. This ISR should check for which interrupt source caused the IRQ and acknowledge the interrupt. Acknowledging an interrupt is like hitting a snooze bar; if the program does not do this, then as soon as it RTIs back to the main program (which restores the previous priority), the CPU will call the ISR again.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Jun 03, 2012 12:23 pm</p><hr />

I would argue though that a programmer who clearly understands the hardware can make more sense of what's happening from a programming perspective.  I realize not everyone sees it this way.  But anytime I've had issues writing assembly (for the 6502 and any other processor) it's because I'm missing how things work on a hardware level.  I'd also say that I've seen emulator authors having issues because they make things too complex by staying way from the hardware level.

I don't know about whether clocked on scanlines or CPU cycles.  For all I know it could be both like the RAMBO-1 where you can choose between counting scanlines or CPU cycles.  Not too unthinkable either if the N106 came first.  Because Tengen ported several Namco games over the the NES they could have designed the RAMBO-1 to support.<br /><br />By the looks of it if there are indeed two counting registers (15 bits total) I would imagine it does count CPU cycles.  Since it's a 15 bit counter there isn't much point to count 64,000+ scanlines.  You'd only count that high if you were looking to count CPU cycles.  But that's not to say it can't be setup to count scanlines as well, who knows.<br /><br />As for the 'firing' terminology it kinda confused me at first as well.  I imagine it is similar to all other IRQs.  Fired means for an IRQ to be generated, it's not very easy for a mapper to insert a BRK via hardware.  <br /><br />For me it's easiest to explain in hardware because that's what it is.  Basically when a IRQ gets triggered by the counter the mapper pulls the IRQ line low.  It HOLDS the line low until the CPU acknowledges the IRQ either by clearing or disabling the IRQ.  If you access (read/write) to $5000-6000 it will acknowledge the IRQ.  This will clear the IRQ and the mapper releases the IRQ line allowing it to be pulled high again.  IRQs will still be enabled, you're just clearing the individual IRQ and setting it up for the next time around.<br /><br />EDIT: For the record according to Disch's docs:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">IRQ Operation:<br />--------------------------<br /><br />IRQs are driven by a 15-bit CPU cycle up-counter.  $5000 and $5800 are *direct* access to the IRQ counter<br />&#40;they are not a reload value&#41;.  Games can also read back the real-time state of the IRQ counter by reading<br />those regs.<br /><br />When IRQs are enabled, the following occurs every CPU cycle:<br /><br />- If IRQ Counter = $7FFF<br />   a&#41; Trip IRQ<br /><br />- otherwise...<br />   a&#41; Increment IRQ counter by 1<br /><br />Reading/Writing $5000 or $5800 will acknowledge the pending IRQ.<br /><br /><br />Sources on the behavior of this IRQ counter vary.  Some say that the IRQ counter wraps from $7FFF to $0000,<br />and trips an IRQ only when it wraps -- however Sangokushi 2 polls $5800, and emulating IRQs that way results<br />in the game locking up shortly after it starts &#40;once it sees that $5800 is not what it expects, it resets the<br />IRQ counter and loops&#41;<br /><br />Emulating the IRQ counter as above seems to work for every game out there -- although it probably isn't 100%<br />accurate.<br /></div><br /><br />And with firebug only stating:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">        - The IRQ counter is incremented at each scanline. When it reaches<br />           $7FFF, an IRQ interrupt is executed, but there is no reset.<br />           This is still preliminary and untested, and I may be wrong on<br />           this point. Splatterhouse and several other games run fine<br />           without it.</div><br /><br />Along with the fact it's a 15bit counter I would tend to believe it's a CPU cycle counter.  Firefly only said his data was preliminary and that games he ran worked fine without an IRQ at all since they didn't use it.  I suspect it isn't a scanline counter at all...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Sun Jun 03, 2012 11:01 am</p><hr />

I assume "IRQ is fired" means that the mapper begins to pull /IRQ low until the next access to $5800.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Jun 03, 2012 8:24 am</p><hr />

Two questions:<br /><br />1) <a href="http://tuxnes.sourceforge.net/mappers-0.80.txt" class="postlink">Firebug's mappers.txt</a> says the N106 IRQ counter occurs every scanline, while the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Namco_106#IRQ_Operation" class="postlink">nesdev wiki</a> says it occurs every CPU cycle.  Big difference.  Which is correct?<br /><br />2) Per the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Namco_106#IRQ_Operation" class="postlink">same nesdev wiki</a> document, what exactly does "IRQ is fired" mean?  I have to assume it means "generates an IRQ", but that doesn't tell me if it's a hardware IRQ (e.g. IRQ/BRK vector is called, etc.), an interrupt/IRQ internal to the mapper itself, nor any other details.<br /><br />Thanks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Sun Jun 03, 2012 6:22 am</p><hr />
