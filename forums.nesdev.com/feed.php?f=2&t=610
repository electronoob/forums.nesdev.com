Ah, so if he wrote only to $2006 and to $2005 but not to $2000 each frame, effectively $2005 isn't enough to setup all scroll parameters because of the name table selection bit, so $2006 should be resseted to choose name table zero....<br />However, write to $2000 every frame is needed as well, as Q descibed.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Sep 28, 2005 1:10 pm</p><hr />

Actually, the proper thing to do is not to write $00 $00 to $2006, but to write your 'origin' nametable to $2000 (lower 2 bits) and your horizontal and vertical scroll to $2005. This sets the same bits as a double-write to $2006 (more, actually) and specifies scrolling parameters as well.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7">Quietust</a> — Wed Sep 28, 2005 12:11 pm</p><hr />

Right at the end of your NMI routine, write zeroes to $2006 twice ($0000 PPU address, right?), and then write whatever value you desire (or just zeroes as well) to $2005 to set up your scrolling. Also make sure that you have $2000 and $2001 set up correctly. This should make the background nice and stable. If it is still unstable, try writing $20, then $00 to $2006 (making the PPU address $2000) instead. Strangely enough, I've found that that works when #$0000 doesn't.

I've got an idea: with the NES's many quirks, why not make a list of things that one has to do to make a game run on a real NES? This will answer the questions of the many n00bs here.<br /><br />I'll start with what I know:<br /><br /><ul>- Wait two V-blanks on startup before doing anything with the gfx.<br /><br />- Read $2002 before writing to $2005/$2006.<br />- Write two zeros during vblank to $2006 (if that doesn't work, write $20 then a zero to $2006).<br /><br />- Use Sprite DMA instead of $2003/$2004 whenever possible.<br />- Write a zero to $2003 before doing a Sprite DMA.<br />- Do all the sprite DMA during vblank.</ul><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=121">family_programmer</a> — Wed Sep 28, 2005 11:20 am</p><hr />
