I shared it since people that may be interested about this product may want to know about the risk.  I just feel bad for Sivak since my goal is not to tarnish the release of his game but was to let people know that you can now get it on famicom, which I was happy about it at first. I didn't know Columbus had an history about their products.<br /><br />Those kind of issues are not found in repro board that I remember when I was more active on nesdev, right? Why is that so? The component used are different today or they didn't just do the proper research to make their carts?

I want to see more and more quality NES homebrews being released on cartridges and keeping the NES alive, but when the actual product is harmful to people's consoles, then that's doing the very opposite of keeping the NES alive, it's literally killing consoles little by little, and tarnishing the image of the homebrew community along the way. I don't want Sivak to have problems because of this either, seeing as he probably wasn't aware of any of this, but I think it's important to educate not only consumers about the dangers of certain types of cartridges, but also game developers so they can better pick the companies they make deals with and don't take part in this shady business of selling harmful products.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Those kind of issues are not found in repro board that I remember when I was more active on nesdev, right? Why is that so?

It's lack of foresight really, because even though they're saving money now, by helping kill the consoles that are still in use they're obliterating the market.<br /><br />There are only so many original consoles still in use, if we don't take good care of them, soon there won't be a market for physical retro game releases anymore.
