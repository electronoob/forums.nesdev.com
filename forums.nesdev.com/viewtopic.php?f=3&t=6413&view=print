<br />I have known (and unknown) bugs in my NES (mostly PPU) which I have yet to fix but I just wanted to give Battletoads a shot to see if it would even run.  If any of you gurus out there notice something that you think you know what the problem might be - PLEASE chime in!! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />

So I'm pretty confident that the PRG bank selection bits are in the correct position.  The one thing that is the big difference (well not that big) is being able to control the H/V mirroring bit.  Maybe I need to invert the polarity of the H/V mirror control bit from the mapper?  I was just using the same polarity as I had originally implemented for the fixed H/V mirror bit.  I'll invert the polarity and see what happens.  Worth a shot!! I will let you know if it fixes anything. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Thanks for the help guys!

<br />
<br />This mapper <em>never</em> uses H or V mirroring.  It's always 1-screen.  It switches between "1ScA" and "1ScB"

<br />AxROM doesn't have H/V selection, it uses single screen mirroring, meaning that the same name table is visible in all 4 slots, and that bit selects which name table ($2000 or $2400) this is.

<br />
<br />I was thinking that the M bit shown in the AxROM control register is supposed to control which PPU address line (i.e. bit 11 or 10) is connected to the PPU CHR-RAM address bit 10 as it does with the blob of solder used in NROM/UxROM/CNROM games.  Is that not correct?
<br />
<br />Another way of saying it is that the AxROM control register bit M is just a "dynamic"/"real-time" replacement for the static/fixed blob of solder used by NROM/UxROM/CNROM games.
<br />
<br />Is that completely incorrect? Haha.
<br />

<br />
<br />You have 4 "slots":  $2000, $2400, $2800, $2C00
<br />
<br />And there are 2 physical nametables:  NTA, NTB
<br />
<br />The mirroring mode just changes which nametables are put in which slots.
<br />
<br />Horizontal mirroring:
<br /> - NTA at $2000 and $2400
<br /> - NTB at $2800 and $2C00
<br />
<br />Vertical mirroring:
<br /> - NTA at $2000 and $2800
<br /> - NTB at $2400 and $2C00
<br />
<br />One screen A ("1ScA"):
<br /> - NTA at $2000, $2400, $2800, and $2C00
<br /> - NTB not accessable
<br />
<br />One screen B ("1ScB"):
<br /> - NTA not accessable
<br /> - NTB at $2000, $2400, $2800, and $2C00

<br />UNROM (mapper 2) minus its fixed bank is BNROM (mapper 34), used in Deadly Towers. BNROM with 1-screen mirroring is AOROM (mapper 7).
<br />
<br />The "dynamic real-time replacement for the blob" is present in MMC1 (mapper 1), MMC3 (mapper 4), and most other ASIC mappers. MMC1 boards can use all four common mirroring configurations (AABB horizontal, ABAB vertical, AAAA single A, and BBBB single B). MMC3 is either less flexible or more flexible depending on the board: mapper 4 boards support only horizontal and vertical, while mapper 118 boards (TKSROM and TLSROM) support arbitrary assignment of A and B, allowing diagonal and L-shaped mirroring as well.

<br />The blob of solder selects which bit gets routed to CIRAM A10 (it's either CHR A10 or CHR A11), but AxROM doesn't rout anything, it just sends to A10 the bit that was written to the mapper last. This means that only one name table is accessible at a time, the one defined by the M bit.

<br />HOLY CRAP!  Okay, that was a huge mis-understanding on my part! Thanks SOOO much tokumaru.  That was a _very_ important bit of information.  I was thinking that the M bit changed the routing of the address lines just like the blob of solder (only dynamically)! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":-o" title="Surprised" />  Now I understand!!! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />
<br />IT'S WORKING!!!  Well, at least 100x better anyway.  There are still some very obvious bugs but I think my implementation of the mapper and mirroring is now correct.  I'm guessing that the remaining bugs are rooted at the most basic level of my PPU logic (which as I said before has known bugs).
<br />
<br />But WHO CARES!!  I'm running playable versions of Battletoads and Marble Madness on my emu!!!! KICK-ASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<br />
<br />Haha, and is it just me or is the segment starting at 1:34 of my new Battletoads video hilarious?! She is bouncing all over the place and to the beat of the music no less!  LOLOL.  If someone has any idea how the music could possibly be causing the screen to move up and down I'd love to hear from you.  In the previous test video the music was making the screen flicker on/off, but now it's moving up and down.  Haha.
<br />
<br />I seriously cannot thank you guys enough.  I am so excited about this!!! And if anyone sees any other obvious issues that they think they know the cause just lemme know!!! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Oh, and the new videos of both Battletoads and Marble Madness (which FYI I totally suck at) are on the site listed in my original posting.  Much of what I said on my site is just a copy of what I wrote here.

<br />It's probably just my audio encoder.  When I compare the audio from Nestopia to that of my emu it sounds exactly identical. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  Seriously, the input audio port on my computer is messed up and sounds like junk.
