Preferably without writing another ROM with a modified PRG.<br />What options I would have to make a repro on this board?<br />I was thinking originally in doing a Batman ROTJ, since I like this game and, as many old games, it's ridiculously expensive here!! But maybe I could do some other games, like Contra J, or even Crisis Force. Stay with this game as is is a good option too, but I really would like to eliminate the slowdown, if possible.

The only way to fix that is by modifying the ROM.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Fisher wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What options I would have to make a repro on this board?</div><br />Remove the IRQ circuit and you've got a fairly standard VRC2b board. Most games using a VRC2 should be pretty easy to get on this board, although some VRC2 variants will need a couple things rewired.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Fisher wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I was thinking originally in doing a Batman ROTJ, since I like this game and, as many old games, it's ridiculously expensive here!!</div><br />This game does not use a VRC2, so it won't work unless you add a mapper hack like the pirates did.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Fisher wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But maybe I could do some other games, like Contra J, or even Crisis Force.</div><br />Contra will require a small modification to the board (or possibly the ROM?) in order to work, since it relies on the microwire interface.<br /><br />Crisis Force uses a VRC4, which means it won't work if it relies on any VRC4-specific features. Additionally, it needs PRG-RAM, so you'll need to add components to handle that (and prevent conflicts with the VRC2).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As I have thought.<br />Looks like the best idea is to stick with the game as-is.<br /><br />I've seem a Batman ROTJ hack, but it's VRC4.<br />Looks like the best thing to do.<br /><br />Maybe I mess up a little and put a socket on PRG ROM to try some hacks... who knows?<br />Up to now, the ROMs I have got/used seemed almost undestructible!!<br />But I really know it's not true!! I think I've been very lucky to have not killed any good cartridge yet.<br />Although I'm very cautious, I don't know if this lucky will last very long, so... better stay as-is.<br /><br />Many thanks for everybody!!<br />Let me know if some more videos would be needed.<br />I'm really learning alot here!! Many thanks for sharing your knowledge!!<br /><br />Edit: Just out of curiosity, I tested some Gamegenie codes with this game.<br />To my surprise, they worked as they should!<br />I tried the US version codes. Interesting, huh?
