		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd really like to have some sort of DEV system... I can't rely on emulators forever. So, what is my best shot?
<br />
<br />I've been giving some thought to buying an EPROM burner, I found some inexpensive ones on the net that got my attention. But then I'd need to rip apart some actual cart, remove the ROMSs and place the EPROMs, probably needing to rewire stuff... Is that adaptation to use EPROMs any hard for a noob in electronics to perform? I can solder, but... that's about it.
<br />
<br />What can you guys recommend to someone with no DEV system whatsoever? Note that I don't have much money to spend on this. And I'll probably have to buy the carts I'll be destroying, 'cause I don't want to ruin any of the one's I got... I bought them because I really liked the games and don't feel like destroying them. I got a non-working original SMB3 though... There is something loose inside it, makes noise when I shake the cart. I tried opening it the bic pen way but had no luck. Maybe I'll just break the damn case and see if the board is of any use for a devcart.
<br />
<br />Thanks for the help.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi,
<br />
<br />I'm very new here, but I was in the same position as you just a month or two ago. I knew a small amount about soldering, but that was about it. From reading and posting, I've completed NROM, CNROM, UNROM and TSROM devcarts.. and I can play quite a large number of games / demos.
<br />
<br />As far as opening the SMB3 cart, look here:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.raphnet.net/electronique/nes_mod/nes_mod_en.php#cartridge_cleaning">http://www.raphnet.net/electronique/nes ... e_cleaning</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />The guy on that page recommends heating up a small piece of plastic, and inserting it into the hole so it will mold to the screw... and that seems like a good idea. You could also search for "nes gamebit" on eBay. I found a  gamebit to open NES games for about US$3.
<br />
<br />It was easy to make the NROM / CNROM devcats - no rewiring needed! Try them out first to get the hang of things - that's what I did before I moved on the UNROM, and finally the mapper 3 TSROM cart - which required cut traces and quite a few rewired points.
<br />
<br />As for an EPROM programmer, I bought a Willem from <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sivava.com/">http://www.sivava.com/</a><!-- m --> They shipped quick and it works well. I bought flash roms from eBay, and EPROMS from Jameco. I also recommend getting some sockets, so it is easier to take the rom's in and out. I got ZIF sockets because they really do require no force to remove (and I was surprised how easy it was to bend the pins).
<br />
<br />If you have any other questions - let me know. I'll be happy to help with what I know (so far)...

<br />haha! You know what? It is probably easier to find NES carts than LP's here... Maybe it's because I'm much more into NES than brazillian music!
<br />
<br />Well, kidding aside, real, original NES carts are indeed somewhat hard to find. The NES was only officially released here after many famiclones were already around, and the NES was already pretty much dead. Most of the carts found here are 60 pins (all pirates), and the few 72 pins are mostly pirates.
<br />
<br />Thanks for all the info above, man! I'm avoiding buying stuff from outside the country 'cause the customs here are a big pain in the butt... they charge 60% of anything we buy. In the case of an EPROM programmer, that's a lot of money. There are a few for sale at a brazillian kind of ebay, maybe you could take a look and tell me if this one is any good: <a href="http://produto.mercadolivre.com.br/MLB-38352610-kit-gravador-de-bios-e-eprom-completo-dip-plcc-promoco-_JM" class="postlink">http://produto.mercadolivre.com.br/MLB-38352610-kit-gravador-de-bios-e-eprom-completo-dip-plcc-promoco-_JM</a> (hope the portuguese doesn't get in your way... most of the specifications are understandable, and there are pictures)
<br />
<br />And the truth is, if I was sure I'd get everything working, I'd buy a really good programmer. But as I may never be able to accomplish what I wan't, I'm leaning towards buying one that "will do the job".
<br />
<br />About the SMB3 cart, I tried melting the pen, a few times, but still coudn't open the thing.
<br />
<br />Could you please tell me why NROM / CNROM devcats don't need rewiring?
<br />
<br />Thanks for the help!

It also looks like it doesn't have the ZIF socket connection for the DIP connections, so it might be nice to put one in (to make it easier to get chips in and out).
<br />
<br />The screenshot for the software looks very similar to the Willem programmer software.. which is easy to use and well-documented on the CD that comes with the programmer. But who knows about support / forums for the programmer in the auction?
<br />
<br />Hmm.. I do a lot of record trading to Brazil, and I sometimes have friends who travel back and forth. I can see if anyone is going soon. Perhaps they can take a programmer to Brazil, and then send it to you when they arrive. I do that all the time to get around the cost of customs. If I send packages from the USA - they always charge extra because of where it is coming from!
<br />
<br />NROM / CNROM carts don't need to be rewired because the pinouts on those EPROM's match the original chips that Nintendo used when they made the game.
<br />
<br />Compare these two pinouts:
<br />
<br />Look at the first one - PRG ROM - 32KBytes (28pin)
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/NES%20ROM%20Pinouts.txt">http://nesdev.com/NES%20ROM%20Pinouts.txt</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Now look at this pinout for a common EPROM (27C256):

<br />
<br />You'll notice that the pins match on the original Nintendo rom and the EPROM <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />It's when the pinouts don't match that it gets tricky. Rewiring, cutting traces, and burning your fingers... that's what I've been doing a lot of lately - but I'm getting the hang of it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Hope that helps.

It does seem kinda expensive for it not including a ZIF socket (those cost probably $5-$10 and the cheaper one I bought to mess with needs huge holes on the board).  You won't need the PLCC-to-DIP adapters for NES probably, you won't find too many carts that use PLCC sockets.  I got my burner from sivava.com (Thailand), it seemed to be the cheapest one (~$50) and came with a few adapters.
<br />
<br />If you can spend about $100-$200 USD, I'd recommend getting an EPROM emulator.  For that price range I've seen new ones for 128kB-512kB, I can find the urls if you want to see them.  There's cheaper used ones around sometimes.  It connects to a cart's ROM socket, then to update the program you run an upload program on PC and reset the NES.  Swapping chips with an external programmer just takes lots of time.
<br />
<br />Or CopyNES, it's cheap as a kit but needs surgery on the NES (safely removing the CPU).  Then make a homemade RAM cart or one of these flashcart boards I'm making, once those work.
<br />
<br />Also, if you find the Squeedo cart interesting (assuming you know all about it, I haven't made a website for it yet), I'm looking for some testers that are actively developing stuff to loan one to.

<br />It uses a PC parallel port and works for all the NES type EPROM's. The software is on the website and works very well. I keep an old PC in the basement just for EPROM and cellphone programming.

<br />The way you explain it it may not be so hard... but I still can't be sure I'm able to do it. This is just what we, NES people, essentially need right? I bet the commercial EPROM programmers are so much more expensive because they can do more than we need, right?

It only has two IC's and is a fairly easy project. I made mine with a ZIF chip for convenience. If you're going to play around with NES hardware you have to do some soldering. This place is great for parts with very low S&amp;H:

<br />Only $5 to ship to Brazil. They ship in a little package which always gets delivered to my door without any customs or taxes. It's actually cheaper to buy the parts from them than to take the bus downtown and pay taxes and busfare.

<br />Wow, I appreciate the help, but I don't want to cause you any trouble, ok? If we can arrange something I'd be more than happy, but if for any reason we can't, just relax. I don't need it for any specific time, I guess I'll do NES development forever! =) I'm just trying to improve my tools as I don't want to rely on emulators forever.
<br />
<br />Yesterday I got myself a NROM game (Spy vs Spy) and a SMB3 cart, as I may want to make a MMC3 devcart someday, when I'm more used to this. Spy vs Spy's connectors are not very clean and it takes some time for the game to work, but it does. I guess I can clean it up with no problems. I Hope this can become my first devcart.
<br />
<br />I managed to open the carts by heating the screws with a soldering iron while applying force to the cart. Works much better than the melted pen. I'll probably have to replace the screws, though. I was surprised to see that both SMB3 carts used different components from one another. One of the WRAM chips was manufactured by SANYO and the other by NEC. And the other chips were different also. My older SMB3 doesn't work, I have no idea why.
<br />
<br />No Carrier, I really appreciate your help, and I guess I can wait a little longer so I can decide what is the best I can get in spite of any difficulties and/or limitations.
<br />
<br />I'm reading about SQUEEDO now, and it seems very nice. Though I do like the idea of games running on standard boards too. Maybe I'll get both someday =)

<br />Yeah, the prices seem good indeed. If the shipping to Brazil is actually $5 I really may consider buying stuff from them. Thanks for pointing the place out.

<br />
<br />Yes, you'll have to take the metal bar that goes across the slot where the cart goes in (on a front-loading NES). You'll also have to cut a hole in the cart itself, because it will be too high to fit in the case.
<br />
<br />Look here:

<br />
<br />I removed the metal bar, and I leave the top of one of my NES's unscrewed. I don't bother putting the cases on the games - I just put them directly into the NES.
