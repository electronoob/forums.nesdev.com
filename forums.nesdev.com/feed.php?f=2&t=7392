I'd like to add one more thing: all this talk about $2006 and $2005 is for mid-screen scroll changes. During VBlank, before rendering starts, the proper way to set the scroll is by using $2005 and $2000. During VBlank, $2006 should only be used for writing/reading data to/from VRAM. Unless you have a good reason to do it differently, but I honestly can't think of any.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Jan 17, 2011 7:16 pm</p><hr />

You can't set fine vertical or fine horizontal scroll with just 2006 writes.  But you can drop the 2000 writes, except when they're needed for enabling or disabling NMI.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Mon Jan 17, 2011 7:11 pm</p><hr />

After that, the NES is expecting a first byte again, regardless of the register. We write the X scroll to $2005.

Bit 14, the highest bit of the fine Y scroll, gets cleared during the first $2006 write. This means that you can only use fine Y scroll values 0 to 3. This is the reason you need the $2005 write that comes next, to properly set the fine Y scroll. If that limitation is not a problem for you, you can get away with using only $2006.

Thanks for all the info!  @tokumaru: that definitely was the problem.  I changed it to write $0360 rather than $2360, and it worked perfectly.  Explains why it was offset by the amount that it was.  I guess $2006 behaves differently depending on whether or not it's currently rendering the frame.  <br /><br />I was trying to figure out how Crystalis and SMB3 handled its mid-frame scrolling changes, but couldn't quite follow it.  The example you posted helped out a lot.  One thing I still don't quite understand is why it seems like you're writing the y-scroll to $2005 first, then the x-scroll, before the final write to $2006.  Loopy's doc and my own tests during vblank indicated that should be reversed.  However, it does seem to work with y-scroll first when changing it mid-frame.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3777">sampsonk</a> — Mon Jan 17, 2011 5:44 pm</p><hr />

I can't possibly find an explanation for what SMB3 is doing.<br /><br />BTW, sampsonk, I think I figured out the problem. Setting the scroll through $2006 is a nonstandard procedure, but we all know that's the only way to do it if we want to change the vertical scroll mid-frame. The catch is that some bits of the value you write to $2006 have a different meaning. Here's a simple description of what each bit does:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">-yyyNNYYYYYXXXXX<br /><br />XXXXX: coarse X scroll &#40;0 to 31&#41;;<br />YYYYY: coarse Y scroll &#40;0 to 29&#41;;<br />NN: name table &#40;0 to 3&#41;;<br />yyy: fine Y scroll &#40;0 to 7&#41;;</div><br />So if you write $2360 to $2006, this is what will happen:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">-yyyNNYYYYYXXXXX<br />0010001101100000</div><br />Note that you are writing 010 (2) to the fine Y scroll, which will cause the top scanlines of your status bar to not be displayed, it will be shifted up. To fix this, write $0360 to $2006 instead. Also, write $00 to $2005 twice to clear the fine X scroll.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Jan 17, 2011 3:54 pm</p><hr />

sampsonk, I hadn't noticed that your name table is at the bottom of the screen. I'm not sure why your code didn't work, as 2 writes to $2006 should be enough to point to the top of your status bar... theoretically, there is no need for the complex $2006/$2005/$2005/$2006 setup. You should clear the X scroll through $2005 though, or the status bar could shift sideways by up to 7 pixels.<br /><br />Maybe this is a timing issue... try adding a few NOPs before the writes to $2006 so see if anything changes. Also make sure that all your writes to $2005 and $2006 are made in pairs, so that the latch that selects between first and second writes isn't left in the wrong state.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Jan 17, 2011 1:51 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, I forgot to mention that one. Maybe I didn't mention it because I don't like it very much, because having to do all the name table updates twice will basically cut in half the amount of updates you can do per frame. But sure, it's a perfectly valid solution to this problem.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Jan 17, 2011 1:43 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Keep in mind that using a status bar together with 4-way scrolling can be tricky, because the status bar limits how much you can scroll vertically. SMB3 for example has a maximum level height of 2 name tables minus the status bar. Crystalis uses IRQs to "skip" over the status bar, preventing it from being displayed in the middle of the game screen. But the simplest solution is to use single screen mirroring, because you dedicate one of the name tables to the gameplay and the other to the status bar, and they'll never overlap. I don't think the MMC3 supports single screen mirroring though.<br /></div><br /><br />Here's another method, used by Gargoyle's Quest II, which allows unlimited vertical scrolling: Horizontal mirroring, keep the status bar in the bottom of the second nametable, mirror writes from the first nametable to the second nametable, avoiding overwriting the status bar. Then, you just split the screen on the bottom to show the status bar.<br /><br />When your scrolling gets low enough such that the status bar would start scrolling onto screen, the screen split <em>for</em> the status bar will cover it up. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Anyway, regarding your code, I honestly can't see any reason for it to not work. Theoretically, you resetting $2006 should cause the PPU to drop everything it's doing and start drawing from that exact location. I've definitely split the screen like that before, and it worked, but I don't have the source code for it anymore.<br /><br />The only thing I can suggest is to try the method mentioned in Brad Taylor's doc like thefox said. (where you write $2006, then $2005, then $2005 again, then finally $2006 again) I've done this method to have a status bar at the top of the screen (and 4-way scrolling under it), and it worked like a charm.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Mon Jan 17, 2011 1:18 pm</p><hr />
