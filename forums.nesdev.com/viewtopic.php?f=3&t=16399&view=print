		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm planning on adding LUA scripting into Mesen's debugger over the next few days and before I started I wanted to get some input about what people would need out of it.  I thought about reimplementing FCEUX's API, but at the moment I think that I might be best off creating a new API in whatever way makes the most sense from Mesen's point of view. I asked rainwarrior for his opinion on this and here's what he replied:<br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I actually don't think FCEUX's lua API is very good. It's very useful, but only because it is barely good enough. It's really very hodge podge, various people have added some minimal things they needed over the years, and at this point it's a fairly useful base set.<br /><br />Here's features I think are useful. FCEUX has many of these, but not all.<br /><br />    callback in response to read or write (ranged), should contain the address and value to be read/written as parameters.<br />    callback in response to Power, Reset, NMI, and IRQ.<br />    peek at all memory (CPU, PPU, OAM) without triggering any read side effect.<br />    peek at PPU/APU state (latch, flags, pixel, scanline, frequency, etc.), peek_state(enum) would allow you to add to the interface just by adding more enum values, rather than a new function for every piece of state?<br />    write to all memory with side effects (e.g. bank switch register writes).<br />    write to all memory without side effects.<br />    printf style text overlay (option for either an X,Y position, or a maintained cursor position)<br />    line and box drawing overlay<br />    overlay should have a parameter to last 1 frame, a specified number of frames, or until &quot;cls&quot;</div>Other than reading registers (e.g PPU/Cartridge registers) with no side-effects, all of this should be relatively easy to implement.<br /><br />Does anyone have other ideas that they'd like to be included in the API?

(FCEUX scripts do this frequently.) It's cumbersome and inefficient, though.<br /><br />It's kind of weird that FCEUX has &quot;sound.get()&quot; or &quot;zapper.read()&quot; but no access to the PPU internal state. There's a lot of stuff it's missing. I suggested a generic &quot;peek_state&quot; interface that takes an enum just because that's probably really easy to add things to gradually as you need them or have time to implement, rather than implementing a PPU reading API, a controller reading API, an APU reading API, etc... but however you want to organize it, access to the internal state of things is often very useful.<br /><br />Ideally, every mapper implementation should have its own couple of enums for peek/peek_state too. If you have savestates, though, all the data you'd need to peek at should be present in that savestate already, so maybe that would make it slightly easier to organize the implementation?

These contain the majority of registers/flags/etc but more often than not as an object rather than the actual register's value (e.g the PPU returns flags as actual booleans instead of a single byte encoding multiple flags like the registers).  I figure a scripting function that returns the same structure would be good enough?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not overly familiar of what LUA offers specifically (I've only used it briefly a long time ago).<br />Either way, the API would not allow raw access to the ram/rom memory - you'd need to use read/write functions (otherwise it becomes too easy for a badly written script to crash the entire emulator)<br /><br />That being said, you made me realize that JS would also be a potential candidate here.  The lightweight JS engines I found only implemented EMCAScript 5.1 (which is 5+ years old by now), though.  One of them was implemented as just 2 files though (.c+.h), which is nice.<br />I'd imagine more people are familiar with JS than LUA (I know I am) - but I'm unsure which one would be easier to work with from the point of view of someone who isn't too familiar with coding in general.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Lua is by far the most popular scripting langauge for games. In stuff I've worked on or used, I've seen either Lua or a custom language specific to that game most often. Python I've seen several times as well. Once or twice I've seen a version of Lisp.<br /><br />The most useful thing is just <em>having</em> a scripting language. The advantages of this one or that one are overall kind of minor in utility. Even differences in efficiency, where they exist, tend to be minimized by the bulk of the work being done in native code anyway; generally the scripting language is not expected to be doing heavy computation.<br /><br />Lua is fairly convenient to integrate into other things, since it was designed for just that purpose. There are other scripting languages designed for this purpose, too. Python was not designed with that in mind, but it's proven pretty usable as a scripting language anyway.

PC?<br /><br />Scripting is used pretty widely in modern games on console as well, has been a part of the game ecosystem for a long while, really. I think Quake's &quot;QuakeC&quot; popularized the idea, but it goes back earlier than that. I'd say it was common as far back as PS1, but there's examples like <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=15931" class="postlink">the bytecode used in Koei's NES games</a> that look an awful lot like a scripting language too.
