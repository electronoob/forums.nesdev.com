		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, I have purchased the kit to make the copyNES, and it will arrive sometime, I don't know when. But I do have a question. So can I just like for example, buy a Lunar Pool cart, which is an NROM 16k PRG 8k CHR cart. Could I just take the MaskROMs out of that, and put in a blank 27C128 for PRG, and put in a blank 27C64 for CHR, then put that cart in copyNES and dump a 16k PRG and 8k CHR game to that cart? That sounds like a really duh question, but I'm just making sure. I'm almost positive that yeah, I could do that, but I've tried manually programming a 27C128 and a 27C64, and putting them in a lunar pool cart, and it didn't work. So am I missing anything?

<br />
<br />You also can't plug EPROMs in directly, since their pinouts are not the same as those from the mask ROMs used in NES cartridges - you need to rewire a few pins in order to do it correctly.
<br />
<br />You could, however, use Flash ROMs along with a special plugin (would likely require additional client-side code) to program a cartridge. You could also just make a RAM cartridge - it won't maintain its data after poweroff, but it will have an infinite number of write cycles, plus it won't require any extra code since both the DOS and Win32 clients have "RAM Cart" modules already implemented.

<br />
<br />If you put RAM in the cart CopyNES can load a game to it, but the game would be gone as soon as you shut off the NES.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure how easy it would be to setup CopyNES to program flash chips - some reqiure 12v and/or they require special signals on the Write Enable pin from my knowledge.

<br />Does this mean that it would be possible with 29F flash chips?
<br />
<br />If I have a cart wired for eproms, should I be able to use the 29F chips without any further wiring?
<br />
<br />With copynes, will a different plugin have to be written for every flash cartridge type?

<br />
<br />Yep.  The wiring is unique though, it needs a /write signal like RAM.  And 29F isn't available with less than 32 pins (that I've seen).
<br />
<br />The same deal with bankswitching applies to RAM and Flash carts, if any registers are at $8000-$FFFF (which includes probably every mapper except Squeedo and MMC5) then it needs some extra logic to disable mapper writes.
<br />
<br />I've finished a layout for a UNROM board that's rewritable by CopyNES (and with Flash rather than SRAM).  I'll be prototyping it pretty soon, would be nice when that works.

I don't know the routing system in the  NES, or in carts, so I don't know which I/O line goes where, and therefor, I cannot make a cart. But those ideas are very good, and I can't wait till they are up and running/selling on kevtris's site! I hope that's what you plan to do...

First of all, is it normal for the DIP cable that you connect to the male to male cable to be so loose? It won't stay on the gold pins, it always just falls off. Secondly, why won't my NES even turn on? When I plug it in, it won't even turn on! This makes me upset! Any ideas why this doesn't work?

<br />
<br />Wow that's so cool!  Keep us updated please!  
<br />
<br />Can you translate some of that into newbie?  I have a mmc3 cart rewired to take eproms.  I believe you're saying that I can rewire it to use the 29F flash, but the mapper chip will cause problems trying to write in the copynes.  Are these logic problems hardware problems or software problems? If I use some other method to write to 29F chips is there a problem using them in my mmc3 homebrew cart?
<br />
<br />Is it possible to have a devcart that writes to 29F chips and then use the chips in other carts?  It's probably easier just to buy a programmer, but it's an interesting thought.

But the funny thing is, is when I put the power cord in the back, and I press the switch, the light doesn't turn on, but the metal peice with by the power source gets really really hot. So there must be some connection. I think maybe I didn't solder the capacitor by the lockout chip correctly. It might be facing the wrong way. Does that matter? That's the only thing I think I may have done incorrectly.

<br />You should try removing the CopyNES board and putting back the CPU in its socket on the NES board. If you still can't switch power on, it's not CopyNES' fault, but more likely something with that capacitor.
