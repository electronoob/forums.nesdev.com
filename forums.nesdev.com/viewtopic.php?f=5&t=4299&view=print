<br />
<br />This documentary is regarding a tv company that mandated in 2007 a group of people to make a famicom game in 2 months.  This game became mr splash and only one copy exist. It was given to the winner of a competition.
<br />
<br />I was checking on the amazon website, the dvd of the documentary came out in 2008/02/02.  After reading the content, it comes with 2 dvd and: 1 cd.. This CD, if I read properly, contains the source of the actual game (!).
<br />
<br />I need to see the documentary soon to see how they made it (tools etc). I'm just curious if anybody had the chance to see the source code of that game? I guess not?  I could buy it but ... It quite expensive. They sell it at 12000 Yen (around 120$ US).. Dvd in japan and tv show.. It's hell to buy stuff here.

<br />
<br />Actually, people that did pre-order the DVD received a rom kit+board.. They had to solder back the cartridge together.  
<br />
<br />Here a picture of the dvd set + box:

<br />
<br />It doesn't use any mapper, only the 2 chips.  Here a picture of the board:

<br />Its a custom made board for that project.

<br />When I continued my research, I found one guy that was selling the dvd set + kit... The guy was selling that for 79800Y (800$ US....).

<br />
<br />Um...
<br />No offense, but that looks like a colorized black and white photograph with a faux image super-imposed on the monitor.
<br />
<br />-edit-
<br />If you look at the reflection in the man's glasses, the led on the monitor isn't reflected, nor is the text.
<br />
<br />The man's ring and glasses indicate the room isn't actually dark and the monitor either isn't even there, or isn't even lit up.
<br />
<br />The lack of dither of the monitor itself, doesn't even match the rest of the image's dither.
<br />
<br />Sorry.
<br />
<br />-edit-
<br />I am not just some dude saying "That looks photoshopped the reflections are wrong!"
<br />
<br />I do freelance statistical and photographic analysis on the side for determining if data is a forgery or likely genuine.
<br />
<br />The reflection in the glasses and wedding ring, along with the shadows on the unit and and keyboard themselves indicate a horizontally rectangular pinpoint light above and to the left of the camera and an ambient light source 30 degrees above horizontal to the right of the scene at a 40 degree angle from horizontal towards the camera.
<br />
<br />Whomever posted that site originally, or you perhaps, have never heard of my "Zeed" 2D into 3D image reconstruction software.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I received today the answer regarding the DVD-BOX set and the meaning of "source included". Here's the answer (in japanese):
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">お問い合わせありがとう<br />ございます。<br /><br />DVD-BOXについているCD-ROMにはMr.SPLASH!の6502のアセンブラのソースコード<br />が全部入っています。<br />nesasnmでコンパイルできます。<br /><br />ただし<br />CD-ROMを作ったときの我々のミスで、ソースファイルのディレクトリ構造が壊れ<br />ているので<br />そのままではコンパイルできません。<br />もし、DVD購入後に質問があれば、もう一度お問い合わせください。<br /><br />Project F<br />POLYGON INUKAI<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Basically, what they say is that the CD-ROM contains the source in 6502 and they can be compiled with nesasm.  But, when they produced the CD, there was a mistake in the directory structure so some file are broken/missing.  If you do buy the DVD-BOX, you can ask the files to them.
<br />
<br />It's interesting to see that they used nesasm for their project. By seeing the board they used, since it requires no mapper, they I guess nesasm must be enough for the task.
<br />
<br />So this mean, if you get the DVD-BOX set and request the source code, you could have "Mr. Splash!" running in an emulator.  I don't know how much "value" it would have but that's good to know.

<br />
<br />Unfortunately getting the source code doesn't necessarily imply getting the game data.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, that's a possibility.  I made a mistake when translating, they said that if you have any other question regarding the DVD-BOX, you can ask. They didn't say about sending back the broken files.
<br />
<br />I just sent another email regarding this. But if you can compile it, this mean the data should be with it.  It's not like they sold the game, they made it for a  TV show. So I guess it has less value compared to a commercial title. This is some home brew made for a tv show only, so I will be surprised if they don't give the data with it.

<br />
<br />So they confirmed that if you buy it, they will send by mail the source code with the right structure.  This is good to know.  Now, will I decide to buy it just because I'm curious... That's another question. It still 12000 Yen just to satisfy my curiosity.

Did they put any restriction on the code for redistribution on the net, reuse etc?  Is it public domain? They didn't mention anything about it.
<br />
<br />So I would love to get it and release it to anybody that is interested as long we have the right to do it in the first place.
