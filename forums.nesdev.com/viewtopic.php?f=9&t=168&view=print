		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You've hit upon the fundamental flaw in CopyNES.  Kev only made a few of them, and never made the complete schematics and software available so that others could duplicate it.  Not that he was under any obligation to do so, it's his intellectual property and he can do what he wants with it.  But this decision effectively killed the CopyNES.  Incidentally, Brian and his Devtendo are headed for the same fate apparently.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As I'm thinking about it, there are some possibilites.  Kevin might be persuaded to share the code, and even if not I think it could be re-implemented given we know how it's supposed to work.  You could even debug a good deal of it in an emulator.  I've always wanted a CopyNES, but until recently didn't have the proper equipment for de-soldering the CPU and PPU from the main board.  If you're interested in reviving, or re-inventing the CopyNES let me know and I might be interested in helping out.  It would take me away from my FPGA based multi-mapper flashcart project, but that's been on the shelf for months anyway.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was thinking about this too..but : how are you going to get an emulator to run your code at 1000-1FFF, 3000-3FFF, I can understand maybe testing out bits of code...but really..copynes does nothing to the output (display/sound) and I don't see any great advantage to testing in an emulator.
<br />
<br />As far as desoldering equipment - try cooking the nes board in cooking oil until it gets warm anough for the solder to melt. This is the best 'cheap' way that I've found. Seriously.
