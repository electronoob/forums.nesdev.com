So I wondered, how do they feel about the homebrew development scene? I don't see how that could possibly affect their sales, since many of these games are not even intended to be sold---they are just made by enthusiasts, for other enthusiasts to enjoy.

If you want confirmation of this, dig around online for details about the Wii and homebrewn games/demos -- continual firmware updates for the Wii intentionally block homebrew stuff.
<br />
<br />EDIT: If you're specifically referring to NES homebrew, my guess is that they're not too concerned with it, as long as it doesn't involve direct copyright violation (copying of sprites/graphics from commercial games), or somehow imposes on the Wii's VirtualWare stuff (which uses an actual NES/FC emulator), especially since that's a form of financial income for them.
<br />
<br />Nintendo Co. (Japan) didn't appear to have any problem with MONDO21's documentary called "TV-GAME GENERATION - SPIRIT OF 8bit"...

<br />
<br />...where a series of dudes got together and made a present-day Famicom game called Mr. Splash.  They had to find all the necessary folks (6502 programmer, two pixel artists, and a sound programmer) too, plus had a producer and director.  They used publicly-available tools (YYChar, NESASM, etc.) to make the game.  Box art, a full game manual, PCB, mask ROMs, and a casing were all made too:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm3DSMULStI" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm3DSMULStI</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k50-R6kESGM" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k50-R6kESGM</a>
<br />
<br />In the case you bought it, you actually got a CD as well, which contained the source code, and a custom-made version of VirtuaNES which only runs Mr. Splash (and the ROM image is embedded in the Windows EXE).
<br />
<br />The source was intentionally obfuscated in a couple ways:
<br />
<br />1) Filenames/directory structure was intentionally lost (so you have tons of files to edit to fix INCLUDE directives)
<br />2) Palette + CHR data files are actually ASCII dumps of the hexadecimal values, which requires you to copy/paste the contents into a hex editor and save them as an actual binary for INCBIN inclusion.
<br />3) Code does not assemble due to NESASM bugs -- variable names are too long, causing it to segfault (yes really!).  Rename the variables to something shorter to work around this.  I have no idea how the authors dealt with this in the first place...
<br />
<br />I've fixed up all of the source myself, and have been able to assemble/link an actual working ROM image of Mr. Splash:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">12/21/2008&nbsp; 14:15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 40,976 001_ProjectF.nes<br /><br />MD5:<br />81CD1CC07B694CFB61B77A098D5A6B9C&nbsp; 001_ProjectF.nes</div>
<br />
<br />I'd rather not give it out based on the fact that I don't know what the copyright is.  My guess is, based on all of the above, they'd rather people not run around distributing the ROM, but actually take the time to go through the pains I did to fix up the source and make their own copy.
<br />
<br />Maybe the latter portion of my post should be put into the FCdev forum... heh.  :-)

I suppose some distinction can be made for "antique" systems but it's splitting hairs. At some point it isn't worth pursuing, and they turn a blind eye to it instead.

<br />
<br />This part was not done on purpose (according to them). There was an error at the pressing of the cd/dvd.  If you can prove that you own the DVD and ask them for the files, they will send you the proper version.  
<br />
<br />I sent an email to them 6 months ago regarding Mr Splash source files since I wanted to know if it was really included with the movie or not.  There is a thread about this in the general forum.  Didn't know someone already looked at the source.  I was going to buy the DVD but gave up (a little bit expensive) .  There was a version with the PCB/eprom for the pre-orders when it came out.

<br />I know a few third-party compilations (e.g. Jaleco's) use PocketNES, but as I understand it, Virtual Console (Wii) and Classic NES Series (GBA) use in-house emulators. Have you evidence that Nintendo licensed a Free emulator?

<br />
<br /> Maybe using the iNES format was a hidden nod to those in the emulation scene. I don't mean from Nintendo themselves, but the programmers. If the higher ups at Nintendo know the association of the iNES format, I'd doubt they'd want it used due to public relation reasons or whatever. But of course that's all speculation <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

And I seem to remember that Sega hid even bigger nods in one of its classics compilation for the Dreamcast (or was it the Saturn?).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Or because it was the first and -- still is -- most prominently used file format for NES/FC games.
<br />
<br />I'm somewhat surprised that a community full of technically-savvy individuals haven't realised the sad reality of technology: what comes first is what usually wins.  Look at how long it's taken to get rid of the ISA bus from x86 PCs (we still haven't fully gotten rid of it, by the way).  We're still using ZIP archives, floppy drives (not entirely on the way out due to complexities involving booting from USB pen/flash drives), and (especially in this arena) parallel ports.
<br />
<br />So Nintendo uses the iNES file format.  So what?  There is no license, AFAIK, on that file format.  More importantly, has anyone actually spoken to Marat Fayzullin to see if he's received any contact from Nintendo with regards to use of his file format in the Wii?  I'm willing to bet not a single one of you has taken the time to do that (it would have been the first thing I'd done).  Seriously guys, ease up.  :-)

<br />
<br />The thing I find funniest about this is that all USB mass storage devices are approximately SCSI, and the only difference between them is minor variations in the SCSI commands they support and what they report themselves as. The "U3" USB keyfobs already lie and claim they are a CDROM and HDD simultanously; I really wonder why no-one has side-stepped this mess and made a USB flash "floppy" drive.

I never tried it myself, but then again I never tried iNES either because I was using DOS/Win3.11 up until 2000. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
