<br />haha, no doubt. They get pretty protective.  Still, I man can dream of the day Nintendo opens it's "classic" platforms to developers everywhere and opens a "hombrew distribution" channel on the wii.

The difference, as it turns out is actually in the quality - every copy of a copy on an analog source degrades. Companies still objected to this kind of piracy, but at least they knew the only wa one could obtain a high-quality copy of their work was from the source - in digital format, there is no loss or degredation - the 100th copy is as clear as the first.

One could argue "Metroid II:Return of Samas" is "Okay" to download because it's not avalible in any other form anymore, and the system it plays on is no longer in production.  If nintendo offered Metroid II on the VC, that argument would lose value.  Nintendo IS trying to resell me games that were once avalible.

You are exercising your right to digitize your own property for your own private use.[/quote] I agree, you are not adding any more physical copies the physical world, however, a copy of the rom image has now been made that was never intended to be made.  As a result, untold thousands of computers now have copies of Super Mario Bros. that were not distributed, or approved for copy by nintendo.  I understand their objection to that.  I'm not sure how I feel about their interpertation of copywrite and "back-up" laws, but I have little to make back-ups of my own.  I've never had a cartridge erase itself on me, and I have no need for a back-up.  I find the whole argument interesting, but it has little effect on my desires - and it seems likely to me that most rom-dumpers probably aren't doing it to protect their investment, given the amount of roms availble on the internet.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I don't know how you can respect their wishes sometimes but not always.

In their legal page, they state it as if it is a fact that emulators have NO OTHER USE THAN PIRACY - homebrew games such as Sudoku 2007, TKO Penguin, and Sack of Flour Heart of Gold proove otherwise. It's an inaccurate statement. Even if MOST emulator use is for piracy, it's not the only thing they can be used for.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">This analogy is quite broken; it is possible to make a "perfect" duplication of an analog tape within the ability of the recorder. No two analog master tapes are exactly even alike nor are game cartridges physically. I don't get how a ROM image is a "perfect" representation of something when it doesn't represent any of it's physical form.</div> That paragraph had no analogy or comparison to Roms or cartridges. It was just a common talking point about piracy and the introduction of digital piracy.  In the past, if one made a tape from a record, your tape suffered a loss in quality  from the record.  The record itself was a loss in quality from the masters.  Any tape you made from the FIRST tape you made of the record, would suffer more quality loss.  Over so many generations, the quality would simply be lower.  It's possible to have high-quality transfers to minimize the loss, or even to create a same-quality master - but for the average person with a tape recorder, loss was impossible to avoid, and it wasent a big deal.  The fact that an .mp3 or a movie file suffers none of this loss is a big threat to the media industries.  It comes up in a lot of discussions at school, and I think it's interesting. It's something I think about when I think about piracy, and I just threw it out there. It had little to do with the discussion of NES piracy.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> Now that ROM images are being legally marketed, it's a whole different ball game since they chose to jump on the ROM image bandwagon, which is a flipflop on their behalf.</div> I don't understand what you are saying here.

<br />This was a comparison to tape-loss and such.  Your copy of Zelda on your PC won't suffer rusty pins, or ever need to have it's battery replaced.  While nintendo may not approve of used cartridges, at least they degrade. When they offer Zelda on the VC, they can claim that your savegame will never be erased with teim - you will never have trouble getting it to work because the cardridge is old and it was treated poorly in it's youth.  If emulators never had a rise on the internet, Nintendo would be the entity that could offer this kind of "Flawless" Zelda experience - due to piracy they cannot hold this claim, and it's a major threat to them -- Much like the digital piracy without quality loss is seen by the music industry as aa major threat to the film and music industries.
<br />
<br />that's what I meant. Sorry if I was not clear enough.
<br />
<br />
<br />I fear that this thread is getting heavily derailed. Perhaps we should start a "Roms/Intellectual-Property Ethics and Ethics of Company Policies Debate" type thread in one of the more General forums...

<br />
<br />I'm pretty sure that I can get a 2-cart to work.  I'll freely admit that there is more to this than I would have guessed, and it's going to be a hell of a lot harder than I thought at first, but I <strong>honestly</strong> think I can do this.  And I might yet be over my head, but if I don't try to build it - I can't learn from my mistakes and I never WILL be able to build one.  My older brother is an Electronic Engineer.  My Uncle's business is replacing all of the electronics in private aircraft - when I run into trouble I know both of them will be happy to steer me in the right direction.
<br />
<br />I could be wrong, but either way I will have learned something by the time I am through - If i'm lucky the end result will be something functional that I built - if I'm not, the end result will be a pile of cables, connectors, a broken Nintendo, and some newfound knowledge.  It's a risk i've already accepted.
<br />
<br />I didn't come to this fourm to make or save face. I'm not here to grow my e-penis and sound big in front of strangers. I came here because the community at NESdev has knowledge and feedback that I can use, and I can learn from them.   I know I might fail, and i'm okay with that.  You know I might fail (and seem to have great faith in my failure,) so <strong>be okay with it.</strong>  I'm not interested in having a discussion about what I can't do - I want to discover what I <strong>can</strong> do.  
<br />So please, try to keep a positive attitude.  I'm looking forward to building this because I think making things is fun, even if it is hard and requires me to gain knowledge. I can always go to the Ben Heck forums if i'm not welcome here.
<br />I know you aren't trying to be mean, but you do intentionaly seem to be discouraging me.  If I fail, it's my mistake to make - not yours. Please accept that.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />That said, can we end this sort of discussion? I'm interested in making this happen in spite of my inexperience.

Then emulators came around and piracy grew exponentially and they weren't happy. When UltraHLE came around they were pissed. Nintendo has since badmouthed unofficial emulators and ROM images to confuse consumers about what's mostly beyond their control. They argue (have argued?) that emulators and bootlegs give an inferior experience to the consumer, while many informed consumers would argue that their VC and minigames are inferior to unofficial emulators and naturally bootlegs. Now that they're in the IP business they're now of course enthusiastic about emulator technology which I would call a change of heart or a flipflop. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">seaniccus wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Your copy of Zelda on your PC won't suffer rusty pins, or ever need to have it's battery replaced.</div><br />It won't suffer because it doesn't have pins, but that can also be detrimental since a ROM image's lack of authenticity makes it valueless today, only because there's no blackmarket value due to the internet's saturation of ROMs.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">seaniccus wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">While nintendo may not approve of used cartridges, at least they degrade.

What Nintendo doesn't want to acknowledge (understandably) is that when you buy a used game, and make a backup, you can have the best of both worlds, the authenticity of a true original cartridge and convenience of emulators. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">seaniccus wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If emulators never had a rise on the internet, Nintendo would be the entity that could offer this kind of "Flawless" Zelda experience - due to piracy they cannot hold this claim, and it's a major threat to them -- Much like the digital piracy without quality loss is seen by the music industry as aa major threat to the film and music industries.<br /></div>
<br />Emulators have been around for a long time, before PCs even. If emulators hadn't been published to the WWW, it's likely that Nintendo would never have been pressured to fight fire with fire, but that doesn't change the fact that developers like to put out emulators in the form of compilation games.

I mostly agree with you - I'm just don't have the passion for backups as you do.   It's hard to argue with your points.  I still don't think Rom dumping is for me.  I agree with you that its not ideal to punish the minority of the right for the majority of the wrong.

<br />The closing of Lik-Sang was a real loss for the online gamer community.  You can find some of their products scattered around, but nobody has really filled the gap.  They would have won that lawsuit if they had the money to fight it - there's nothing illegal about importing products for another market.

<br />Oh yeah, I know - I already have enough connectors to try the 2-cart, I just won't have the time to work on it for a few days. If I think I can build a bigger system after I figure the 2 cart setup, i'll look online for a good source of connectors so I dont have to build so many.
<br />
<br />I was just saying that it's really toobad lik0sang is gone. Those guys were awesome.

Maybe 200mA per game. If you did 16 games, that would require a ~3.2A power supply, very hefty unless it's a switching supply. The best option would be to reuse a PC power supply which would be overkill. Altogether it's pretty frivolous and wasteful of electronic resources since even after you switch games you'll have to get up and press reset unless you modify the NES as well.<br /><br /></div>
<br />
<br />Could you get past the need to press reset by making use of the CIC?
<br />What I mean is, you are going to press a switch button to change games, could the CIC be "temporarily" disconnected, causing the internal NES CIC to trigger a reset.  After the reset has been triggered by the NES, as long as the new game is selected and the CIC re-connected, so it should work (I think).
