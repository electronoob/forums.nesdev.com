<br />
<br />I want to know what is the exact difference between those two version, and how to identify which one I have. If I am not mistaken, one of them can be used for Dev Cart making or repro of FF3j.
<br />
<br />I have searched google and the archive of nesdev but I come with some contradictions in my results and would like if possible to get the bottom word on this.
<br />
<br />I thank you for your time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There is 2 revisions in the USA, not counting the japanese version (SMB USA) which is also in NTSC.
<br />However this has nothing to do with FF3. I guess what is meant is that older producted carts with NES-TSROM-01 to 03 PCBs still have all pins on the connector, while NES-TSROM-04 and more recent PCBs removed all unused pins, including the CHR /WR pin needed for adding CHRRAM. You could just pase some aluminium paper here instead to recreate the pin I guess. Or you could use any other game than SMB2 that also uses an old TSROM or TFROM board. Using TFROM-01 or TSROM-01, 02 or 03 board will be the only way to have that pin with a MMC3 board, but then you'll have to add the battery (and SRAM if using TFROM).
<br />If you take a TKROM board you have the battery, but have to add the pin. 
<br />
<br />Eventually a TNROM board is the ideal donnor, but the only available are FF3 and Destiny of an Emeror 2 in japan, and maybe some other minor japanese-only games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So the difference would only be that in some version of SMB2 you have all the 72 pins, and in the other you have some pins missing? I checked my copy, it has all the pins, but 5 of them aren’t connected to anything. Is that how you spot the difference between the two version, by checking if it has all the 72 pins present?
<br />
<br />My goal isn’t really to make a ff3j cart right now, but I am really surprised to hear from you that there is no compatibility between old versions of SMB2 and ff3j. Even on this forum, everytime someone talk about ff3j, people mention SMB2 as one of the only potential donor (along with some people mentioning Mega Man 4, Mega Man 6 and sometime Gauntlet 2). Here are some example of threads talking about a repro of ff3j and SMB2:

<br />
<br />Maybe this is a just a very persistent false information. I have no idea, I started this topic to try to get a clearer idea of what’s the deal with SMB2.

<br />
<br />SMB2 is half compartible but you'll have to replace CHRROM with CHRRAM. The persistant false information is that only SMB2 is compatible wich is wrong. Many games would be compatible just as SMB2 is no more no less.
<br />And the number of pins has nothing to do with the revision of the game, but with the revision of it's PCB.
