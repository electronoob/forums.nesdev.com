A &quot;green&quot; area is hinted at the bottom right, and there's a single green &quot;milestone&quot; in the bottom left quarter. My hopes is that things like that will help orientation in a larger, sprawling cave system. <br /><br />-Made rocks have quite a brighter outline. <br /><br />-More distinctly diagonal shadows on the pillars in the bottom right quarter seems to help my depth perception. <br /><br />-various details and decorations added. <br /><br />-still plenty of room: about half of the bg-chr is unused.

While I have a tool to manually edit metailes, creating them is slow work.  I think you're right, I need some tool to automagically generate at least a rough start of them, from whatever format you're working with (what format/tool ARE you working with?)

(1 byte of collision information per metatile, which allows 2 bits per &quot;block&quot;, allowing for 4 different collision levels, most likely &quot;open&quot;, &quot;blocked&quot;, &quot;lava/water&quot; and &quot;destructable&quot;).  It wouldn't be terribly hard to switch to 2 bytes of collision information per metatile, allowing for a lot more flexibility.<br /><br />The important factor is how the 8x8-level collision tiles are arranged.  Right now for something like this,<br /> <a href="https://imgbb.com/" class="postlink"><img src="https://thumb.ibb.co/e4jRhb/test.png" alt="Image" /></a>, I'd have to do more collision checks for each actor, to make sure they don't straddle it (I'd have to do a check every 8 pixels along the width of the actor) and I'm afraid I'd be spending too much of my cpu budget on collision checks.  If we don't allow this sort of configuration, it will be a lot cheaper.<br /><br />I'd say send me the screen tool data, and I'll play with it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i'll send it right away! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Right, because y collisions doesn't need to happen as much as x ones. <br /><br />Here's a basis for further discussion on collision granularity.<br /><br />The example you posted is something i'd avoid regardless. A bump like that would be there to either:<br />- incentivize a jump over it<br />- provide partial cover<br />- stop/turn around walking NPC:s<br /><br />All of which could be done with a 2 wide platform just as well. A 2 wide, 2 high platform would be more radically different, though. <br /><br />The rest of the picture tries to demonstrate how various wide gaps (rather than bumps) could interact with our player controlled objects.<br /><br />A two-wide gap looks a bit awkward for the vehicle (better just avoid it?) A one-wide and it'll pass over smoothly. A three or four gap would stop it dead in its tracks and risks being a nuisance. Except if...<br /><br />We had a tilted climbing animation for the vehicle (that's the thing with caterpillar treads, innit?) and made it auto-climb one-step-ups. The hover-bike would naturally hover, so no problem there (i imagine it has a slew rate when falling and would anticipate/adjust to slight rises). <br /><br />Maybe 2-wide gaps wouldn't look so bad either with the tilted tread cel.  <br /><br />Speaking of auto-climb, the &quot;squat over bike&quot; pose just happened to be a pretty close match to a first cel in a potential (auto?)climbing move for the player character. This would have a precursor in later 2d metroid games.<br /><br />For the player character, two-wide gaps are perfectly sound to stand in. One-wide gaps looks a bit squeezed as the PC is at least 10px wide at the base when standing.<br /><br />I figured one benefit would have been that the PC could fall in narrow gaps where the vehicle can't, but it'll still look squeezey. Also, we could achieve the same with some sort of ladder mechanism if we wanted to (as does BM, for comparison).<br /><br />Pushing blocks/puzzle mechanisms isn't anything we have in our design notes so far. I added that implication in just for fun scavenging tiles from the squat pose and shooting pose. <br /><br />If 8x, 8y is a guarantee for cycles down the drain in a very general sense, I think these factors makes me lean towards a 16x, 8y granularity. Does that make sense?

It can be difficult with limited colors to create enough contrast between the foreground and background, and you've done an amazing job at that.<br /><br />I'm unsure if you've made any changes to the original image you posted in this thread, but I did have one thought. First, the foreground looks amazing, so great job on that. The dithering on the mountains (mountains, right?) in the background seems a little busy. It might be beneficial to shorten the dithered lines, maybe to half length. Not sure what your thoughts are on that...
