Instead of making another post, I'll ask in here since I have a similar question.<br /><br />I am building a small project homebrew computer out of the NES's 2A03. I am having trouble with getting both SRAM and ROM to work.<br /><br />Currently I have the M2 line wired to a active-high enable on a 74HC138 (3-8 decoder). A13-A15 on the CPU are wired to the A0-A3 pins on the decoder.<br /><br />For the 8k SRAM, Output 0 on the decoder goes to /CE ($0000-$1FFF), the R/W pin (on the cpu) goes to /WR, but is also inverted and sent to /OE. <br /><br />For the 8k ROM, Output 7 on the decoder goes to both /CE ($E000-$FFFF) on the ROM, and /OE. <br /><br />Data and Address buses are matched to their appropriate pins.<br /><br />Now from the first tests, it seems the ROM is working, because running a infinite loop, the address pins stay at their appropriate address ($E000).<br /><br />However I am having a bit of trouble with the SRAM. Does this wiring job look correct?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4784">Ioncannon</a> — Tue Apr 05, 2011 7:42 am</p><hr />

I think the only thing we have to worry about is using super-the-fast new chips with TWP times less than 30 or 40 ns, which is good news <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Did you calculate the added delay using the 74 series chip to add inputs to you CPLD?<br /><br />I've also been thinking of adding cool stuff in the $5X pages that would add extra functionality to the mapper without breaking MMC3 compatibility. Stuff like an 8-bit multiplier or a division unit, a port similar to the PPU ports that would allow you to read from any location in ROM with auto-increment, and all sorts of cool stuff like that.

It includes A13,A14 to make the WRAM enable, and the second part of the '139 brings in A12 so the control registers are at $5xxx.

I understand this race condition now that I know A15 is delayed.<br /><br />EDIT: From here down I am completely off-base.<br /><br />I don't think this will have an impact on the design I am working on. I am not edge-triggered on PRG /W. I am using combinational logic that checks PRG /W, M2, PRG /CE and the address lines. So the race condition will not impact me. If /W goes low before /CE does I won't issue a write, but then on the falling edge of /CE I will. The opposite case also works fine.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3706">qbradq</a> — Sun Apr 03, 2011 4:50 pm</p><hr />

MMC3 for example can map WRAM at 6000-7fff and registers all through 8000-ffff<br /><br />The standard way is to check if /CE is high meaning the CPU is accessing 0000-7fff,  then M2 has to be high, and finally your other address lines of interest.  for decoding WRAM, you basically need to detect this condition:<br /><br />M2 high<br />/CE high<br />A13 high<br />A14 high<br /><br />Then R/W connects to /WE on the RAM,  /OE is grounded, and /CE connects to the above logic.<br /><br />Note, when using a 6264, one of those can be connected to +CE on the RAM (pin 26, I suggest M2) leaving only three lines to decode.<br /><br />Address and R/W are always valid when M2 is high (and a little while after M2 falls).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=230">kevtris</a> — Sun Apr 03, 2011 4:45 pm</p><hr />
