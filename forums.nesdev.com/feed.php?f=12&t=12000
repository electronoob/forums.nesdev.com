Yeah, the original background image had a lot of colour depth.  Rescaled to 256x216 at 15bpp, it still has a couple thousand colours.  But it looks almost identical with 548 colours, whereas with 212 the decline in quality is more evident.  So, HDMA.<br /><br />There are 44 colours reserved for sprites.  The second big jump in colour count, to over 800, is a result of translucent sprites overlapping the most chromatically diverse area of the image.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Stef wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Your last post sounds very intriguing and exciting !

Well, I got it working.  (Not just the VBlank thing; the whole code.)<br /><br />It's a mockup of the title screen and main menu for the shooter I'm going to try to port.  VRAM and OAM are essentially full, all 8 HDMA channels are busy making the most of the CGRAM, both mask windows are in use, a good number of the sprites use add+half transparency, and my slightly extended VBlank (using a pair of interrupts now, rather than a single one with H/V polling) is almost entirely occupied by DMA and related operations, at least in certain frames.<br /><br />(Protip:  If your IRQ might be interrupting a subroutine that changes the data bank, it should change it back before doing anything else...)<br /><br />The CPU is so busy <s>running my inefficient code</s> rendering a ~5 kB chunk of the background (because I ran out of VRAM and OAM) and recalculating 691 colour entries (the HDMA tables and most of CGRAM) that the animation chugs along at 12 frames per second.  I could have hit 20 or 30 with a lot more precomputed data in ROM and maybe some smarter coding, but I plan to have the Super FX handle all that stuff in the real thing, and if there are two things that chip is good at, they are bitplane blitting and multiplication.  I figure I can get 60 fps with the Super FX.<br /><br />Peak colour count on screen is somewhere north of 800.  The program runs perfectly on real hardware, and on every emulator I tried... except no$sns, which doesn't respond to controller input, and also seems to mess up the HDMA slightly, resulting in garbage pixels in the middle of the screen.  (...I guess that's not really helpful without the code, is it?)<br /><br />...<br /><br /><s>The only thing that still bugs me &#40;aside from the horrible brittle mess that is this code&#41; is the fact that I eliminated a sporadic, timing-sensitive, apparently <em>data</em>-sensitive &#40;&amp;?*#@$!&#41; colour transform glitch by removing the direct page reset from the start of the IRQ.  I hate it when something works without me knowing why, especially when it involves not doing something that I could very well need to do in the future...</s><br />EDIT:  <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=12083&amp;start=15#p137217" class="postlink">ARM9 figured it out</a>.  Really basic proper IRQ usage - I ended up clobbering B, but only with the DP reset; everything else was pure 8-bit.  That's why removing the DP reset fixed the problem (obviously if any of my code had changed DP this wouldn't have been a good idea).<br /><br />Even so, it does work.  I have demonstrated to myself that this part of the game can be satisfactorily rendered on the Super NES.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Interesting technical discussion too.  My initial question was kinda soggy, but it seems to have produced useful dialogue...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6595">93143</a> — Thu Nov 13, 2014 7:58 pm</p><hr />

&gt; Don't let me pressure you. I've got enough going on myself (and am new enough at SNES programming) that I doubt I'll be able to do much more than noodle around for at least that long...<br /><br />It's all good. I'm happy that you're digging out problems, and we can add them to the list.<br /><br />But I'd hate for you to be under the impression that higan is a perfect emulator or anything, or that I'll be able to help out in fixing things quickly like I used to. As long as you're okay with that, then by all means, keep up the good work (at your own pace, of course) :D<br /><br />&gt; This obviously can't be and isn't how a real SNES PPU works<br /><br />I agree. And I must say, you sound a lot like TRAC and anomie (which is a very high compliment, if it wasn't clear), in that you have a lot of the theory of operations down very well. Moreso than I do.<br /><br />The problem I find is that turning the theory into practice is a lot more difficult than it sounds.<br /><br />There are definitely a lot of design decisions I don't strongly care for, but they were made because all of my attempts to do things differently didn't really pan out. It's extremely challenging to model massively parallel operations into single threads. The PPU is absolutely nothing like a computer program running. So despite understanding the bandwidth limitations and interleave patterns, turning it into working C++ code has eluded me thus far.<br /><br />I am certainly hoping you'll be able to help out some more in this regard, and I would be extremely grateful for any additional insight you could provide. I'm still very appreciative for the awesome work on the hires color blending.<br /><br />&gt; I'm under the impression EXTBG only applies (i.e. is only visible/usable) in mode 7<br /><br />nocash has said that it works outside of mode 7. I have not actually attempted any tests to see if you can in fact create visible artifacts by attempting to use it, but I trust him on this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Tue Nov 11, 2014 10:40 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">93143 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Could this have anything to do with the fact that the artifacting on the left hand side of the first active scanline looks like it comes in 8-pixel chunks on the real system, but definitely doesn't in higan?  Or is this just a coincidence (the artifacting on the right side of the last blank scanline isn't in 8-pixel steps on either platform)?<br /></div><br /><br />Higan's dot based renderer fetches each layer's nametable and pattern data from VRAM on the exact pixel it's first needed, which depends on the horizontal scroll register for that layer. This obviously can't be and isn't how a real SNES PPU works--if all the layers had the same horizontal scroll it would have to fetch them all at once, but it can only fetch one word from VRAM at a time. A real SNES works like the NES does: it fetches nametable data and pattern data in a round robin sequence regardless of the scroll registers, and the fine horizontal scroll (the low 3 bits of the scroll register) determine how many pixels the data for each layer is buffered before being output.<br /><br />On the NES, each byte fetch takes two pixel clocks and the sequence is &quot;one nametable byte, one attribute byte, two pattern bytes&quot; every 8 pixels. On the SNES the sequence also loops every 8 pixels, but each <strong>word</strong> fetch takes <strong>one</strong> pixel clock and the sequence is a varying mixture of nametable data, offset-per-tile data and pattern data depending on the BG mode. That's the reason the SNES modes are what they are and why offset-per-tile is different in mode 4 than in mode 2 or 6: if you add up the number of layers (= nametable fetches), the number of offset-per-tile tables (two for mode 2/6, one for mode 4) and the number of pattern data fetches (one word per two bitplanes in normal resolution, one word per bitplane in mode 5/6) every mode adds up to exactly 8, except mode 6 which has a wasted cycle. If mode 6 had two 2bpp layers instead of one 4bpp layer it would use all 8 cycles, but Nintendo's engineers evidently decided two 2bpp layers wasn't colorful enough and one 4bpp layer was more useful (even so, I'm not sure if any commercial game uses mode 6)<br /><br />I have a plan for determining what the exact sequence and timing is for each mode by using non-mode-7 EXTBG to spy on what the PPU is fetching, but I don't know when I'll get around to it and whether it'll even work on hardware (I'm not sure if it's possible to display the EXTBG in all modes)<br /><br />My idea is:<br /><br />Set up VRAM so that each fetch type returns a different, constant value (i.e. every word in a particular layer's nametable is identical and points to a solid colored tile)<br /><br />Set up the palette so that each of those values shows up as a different, contrasting color when interpreted as EXTBG data.<br /><br />Set the TM register so that only the EXTBG layer is visible.<br /><br />Set the mosaic size on the EXTBG layer to 9 pixels to make the output easier to see.<br /><br />The main obstacle is, as I said, that I'm not sure exactly how EXTBG works in non-mode-7. Is it always layer 2, or is it the layer after the last &quot;real&quot; layer? (the latter seems more useful if EXTBG really was originally designed to mix in layers generated by expansion chips) If it's always layer 2, does it replace the real layer 2, or is it mixed with it somehow?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3737">AWJ</a> — Mon Nov 10, 2014 10:28 am</p><hr />

&gt; Is this a known issue with higan?<br /><br />I've already told you in the other thread that my dot-based renderer is still in the guess-work phase.<br /><br />It's the first (and so far, only publicly available) dot-based SNES PPU renderer. Everything else public renders the entire line immediately.<br /><br />Unfortunately for the two years it existed and I was in a position to do a lot of research and improvements, nobody was interested in what I was working on.<br /><br />Now that I'm backlogged on 100 dependencies that I have to resolve before I can continue to work on higan further, I'm getting almost weekly reports about rendering issues (this, Smash It demo mosaic, Anthrox split-screen, etc.)<br /><br />So ... sorry. Yes, it's buggy. Because it's new, and hasn't had much of any help by anyone else. Yes, you're going to keep finding these bugs if you are trying to do mid-scanline effects. It's going to be at least 6-18 months before I am able to work on higan again. I'm really that back logged.<br /><br />&gt;  Mostly I was wondering about the apparent timing difference between the real system and the most accurate known emulator...<br /><br />higan is definitely the most accurate emulator by <em>orders of magnitude</em>, but you have to understand that this is not something to praise higan for: it's a testament to how terribly awful everything else is.<br /><br />We still have a very, <strong>very</strong> long way to go in SNES emulation.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Sun Nov 09, 2014 12:24 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Could you summarize in your own words?<br /></div><br />Nope, since there are a pair of diagrams that make it clearer.  Look what I found on the web!<br /><br />But thankfully this isn't the situation that 93143 is running into.  I think his &quot;pseudo-NMI vs. screen-on-and-return&quot; methodology sounds best for this situation (easy to implement).  The timing concern, though, is still interesting.  byuu et al probably have ideas, and I'm curious to know what it might be.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Sat Nov 08, 2014 9:15 pm</p><hr />
