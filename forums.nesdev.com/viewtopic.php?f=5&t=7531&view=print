		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was programming an Apple IIe in assembly language back in middle school in the early 1990s, which is how I learned 6502 asm. I became interested in NES emulation sometime in the 2000s, and I wrote a few demos that worked on the emulators of the time but not necessarily on NES hardware because I had no way to test. Zophar.net had some of the documents (including koitsu's that you mention). I coded for the NES off and on, mixed with PC and GBA coding. My interest in NES programming really picked up once I got my PowerPak and could see my work run on the real thing.

<br />Sounds like those <strong>weren't</strong> the days. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />Nowadays you have a lot more information. More accurate information. Better tools, etc.
<br />
<br />As for the question.. I first started learning 6502 assembly in 2000. I think I did some crappy ROM at the time that played NSFs (though it only worked in Nesticle), but that was about it. It wasn't until 3 years later that I took a more serious stab at it and began writing my own NES emulator, and I also wrote a few small things for the NES itself in the years that followed. 
<br />What I remember from those days was the hassle of testing stuff on HW, since I didn't have any kind of dev cart myself. So I used to send ROMs to Bananmos (we went to the same school at the time) and asked him to test them on his NES since he had an EPROM-emulator. And he would say "yeah it works" or "no, it doesn't work", and I would have no idea what it looked like when it ran. Not exactly the best way of doing things  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />Nowadays I do very little NES development, but I've done a lot of SNES development over the past year, and I still find a lot of the threads here interesting to read.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I started rom hacking around 2000 or so and was interested in rom expansion. Every document I looked at said something along the lines of "Nes rom expansion is impossible. If you don't know how, don't try, and those that do know why." Eventually I ended up at nesdev and homebrew kinda trumped rom hacking for me.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In general, NES ROM expansion requires <ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>decomposition into header, PRG, and CHR (whether through iNES splitter or an unzip program), </li><li>duplication of any fixed last bank of PRG ROM, </li><li>normalization of bank numbers written to the mapper (this might be what was considered "impossible" in the general case), and </li><li>recombining header, PRG, and CHR. </li></ol>
<br />I should know; I've <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Forbidden_Four" class="postlink">expanded The Legend of Zelda</a>. I have a cousin who's been expanding SMB1 with CNROM to animate certain tiles, though I told him it was wasteful and he should try a CHR RAM based method that pushes those few tiles that animate (? and coin) during otherwise idle periods.
