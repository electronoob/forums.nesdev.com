		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When I first tested my emulator with Blargg's ROMS, I noticed that I could hear the beeps, but there was no output on the display.  Looking into it I realized that his roms use mapper 0, but they expect to be able to write to CHR-RAM.
<br />
<br />Once I modified my mapper 0 to setup 8 kiB of CHR-RAM for roms that don't have any CHR-ROM, it worked fine.
<br />
<br />My concern is that I have broken some mapper 0 games by doing this (do any of them inadvertently write to CHR-ROM?).  What are the criteria for deciding whether or not to enable CHR writes for mapper 0?  Is this something I should just hack in for Blargg's ROMs or are there real games that use this?

<br />
<br />Okay, I had already done this, but I was momentarily confused, thinking that there were possibly ROMs out there that didn't expect/use either CHR-ROM or CHR-RAM.  Silly.

<br />Thanks for the quick reply.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've wondered about this issue myself. I never really paid much attention to what iNES flags I used for the test ROMs. I figure if a cartridge file has no CHR data, you pretty much have to assume it's using CHR RAM. I've considered using CHR ROM but that'd only be possible on some of the tests. Using CHR RAM for everything allows a single general configuration (which matches my devcart that I test them on). I also figure that an emulator that's at the point where my tests will help will be well beyond the point of supporting CHR RAM properly.

A good example of "missing" gfx is the game <em>Fantasy Zone</em> (CHR-RAM writes enabled when CHR-ROM is present).

It seems to me it'd be better to attack this problem at its source (ie:  the bad headers themselves).  Rather than working on a way to make bad headers work... we should be working on a way to correct the bad headers.
<br />
<br />Instead of a CRC database.... why not an IPS database?  Most emus already have softpatching, so why not distribute a bunch of common problem header fixing IPS patches?  They would only be like 25 bytes each -- which would .7z down to practically nothing.
<br />
<br />That's something I thought of doing in the past, anyway.

<br />So what happens when a homebrew program matches a commercial game's CRC by coincidence? It's not unlikely given the number of commercial NES/Famicom games, both licensed and not, and pirate versions, hacks, and other images recognized by Cowering's GoodNES.
<br />
<br />Or are you targeting your emulator only at people who want to play illegal copies of commercial NES games? In that case, you may be "inducing" piracy under the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of copyright law, which is persuasive though not binding in some other English-speaking countries.

<br />
<br />Nope.  Those who write emulators with checksum databases are making the problems worse.  The reason that invalid iNES headers are so common is because they don't NEED to be valid on Joe Blo's 1337 Emulator (because it has a kewl MD5 database!)  Stop supporting invalid ROMs!
<br />
<br />A better idea would be to provide the ultimate cross-platform iNES to UNIF conversion utility (this probably already exists, minus the cross-platform part) that uses the MD5 database.  Then when people have questions about why DiskDude ROM #20858 doesn't work on my emulator, I can point them to this utility which converts it into a corresponding UNIF ROM that works on any modern emulator.  That way I don't have to maintain a ROM database.

<br />
<br />There simply aren't enough established UNIF board names to make it a reasonable replacement for iNES.  While generally most US releases will fit neatly into a UNIF file, more obscure games won't.  Some iNES ROMs just simply do not have a UNIF equivilent.  One of the reasons I never fully got on board with UNIF.
<br />
<br />That's not to say UNIF <em>couldn't</em> be a viable replacement if it were more complete.  But as it stands now, it just doesn't fit the bill.

<br />There are regions BTL, HVC, and NES. For conversion of boards whose names are unknown, make a new region "INES" where the boards correspond to the mapper numbers. For instance, "INES-000" would be interpreted as a synonym for NES-NROM-256 or (if lacking CHR ROM) NES-BNROM, "INES-002" would be equivalent to NES-UOROM, etc. True, this isn't the best option in the long term, so a ROM checker would not classify a ROM using an INES-* board name as a [!] (verified good dump).
