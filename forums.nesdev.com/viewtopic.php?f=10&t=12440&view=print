		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Two things:<br /><br />1. I would guess the sta $2006/sta $2006/lda $2007 is what's causing your problem (particularly the lda).  I'm not even sure what you're trying to accomplish there (I understand the code, just not the purpose).  It looks like you're trying to back up parts of the palette *while* changing parts of the palette.  I think because of the load, you may end up tweaking some of the internal PPU addressing bits, causing glitching on-screen.  You may need to set $2005 to zero twice, and/or touch $2000, either in the middle of this routine or at the very end (see #2).  The details are here (be prepared for pain): <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/The_skinny_on_NES_scrolling">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/The_ ... _scrolling</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I'd suggest just keeping all of the palette contents somewhere yourself (e.g. in ROM) and just writing them out to the PPU as needed.  Only update the palette entries you need to (i.e. don't update all of them unless you truly require such).<br /><br />2. You didn't disclose where/when this routine is being called.  If it's being done in NMI/during VBlank, then possibly your routine combined with other code in NMI/during VBlank is taking too long (extending outside of VBlank), thus causing problems.  You might need to set $2005 to zero twice, and/or touch $2000 as well, before the end of the routine (so that when VBlank ends and the raster gun begins reading from PPU memory, it starts reading from the correct address).<br /><br />Just thoughts that came to mind.

I tried adding two writes of zero to $2005 twice, I tired during, and even at the end of the routine but got the same result. I also tried doing a simple check of $2000, but still got the same result.

Why don't you keep a copy of the current palette in RAM at all times? That would probably simplify things.<br /><br />That being said, I don't see any serious bug with this specific piece of code, so the problem must be the timing, or some other configuration. We'd need to see more code... but judging from the lack of labels and variable names I guess you're the guy who codes in hex, right? A ROM would also help us debug this.<br /><br />I must say that incrementing the VRAM address manually is an odd choice, considering the PPU automatically increments it after each access (by 1 or 32, it's your choice). You only need to set up the address once at the start ($3F00), and then read all the bytes in a loop. You can end the loop when X reaches #$20, there's no need to keep track of the address.

But then I thought, if this is your hook code to capture the game's already written palette data, then it's possible that you don't know the state of the incrementor (+1 or +32) so you're playing it safe in that respect.<br /><br /> It sounds like you're reading from the palette ram during active display. Can you post a pic?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The code that I pasted is my own code. I'm not that familiar with increments of the vram. I have (borrowed) the vram engine from Legend of Zelda, where i can load up nametable updates, quick palette updates, all while PPU Rendering is on, and i get the correct results. The issue I'm having, is definitely the reading of $2007. Someone suggested i should have my palette values, to be stored in ram while it's being written to vram, so i can simply alter the ram contents, and have the engine load the ram address, and store the new updated palettes to $3F00-$3F1F.<br /><br />So i may just have to redo my asm, to incorporate the ram storage of any palette updates. It's just tedious, cause i have certain palette updates going on, that are small in nature, and will have to come up with different setups, to have those portions stored into the correct areas in ram. I figured i could just bypass all of that with a simple read of $3F00-$3F1F.<br /><br />For a poor mans cheat way of doing it, i have ppu rendering turned off, i then read the palettes, store to ram, then turn ppu rendering back on. Obviously i get the millisecond black screen, but that quick flash I'm able to live with, compared to the alteration of my vertical scroll position.

When the project is finished, ill upload a video. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Also, here is another question I have on the $3F00,04,08,0C bg palettes<br /><br />On-the-fly, I can alter the individual color to either of the addresses above, like, I goto the ppu hex viewer and alter the hex value, and I can see the color change within the ppu viewer, and see the results obviously on screen. But, if I try to simply have my vram load the address and color id to store, it just does not work. Is there a way to have individual colors in those 4 spots, or do they all have to match?
