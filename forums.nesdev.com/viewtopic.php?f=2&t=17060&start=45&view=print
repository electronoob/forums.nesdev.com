		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I ended up pretty much half-randomly assigning the default color palette.  It's more or less impossible to come up with something perfect considering there are 16 colors to select at the moment.  If anyone comes up with something that's better, feel free to post a screenshot of the color setup window &amp; I can update the defaults to match.<br /><br />Distinguishing the 1st/2nd write on the PPU registers that use them would be possible without too much effort, I think, if that's something that would make sense.  Could also add APU register read/writes (as 2 colors) - I'm not sure there is much of a reason to do so, though? Can be achieved via the breakpoint marking functionality if really needed, too.<br /><br />Overall, it looks like this now:<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />People may have different opinions on this one, but I don't think there's much point in distinguishing the 1st/2nd write to $2005/$2006. In normal circumstances it should be obvious that you're doing a double-write. And when it's not the tooltip should suffice.<br /><br />I kind of liked the older default colour scheme better as writes to $2005/$2006 are much harder to distinguish now. But now that the default can be changed I can just change it back to my liking, so just figured I'd mention it in case you like feedback on the defaults.<br /><br />The latest version does seem to have a bug on my side though: It only shows the PPU writes for a partial frame. See this screenshot from Years Behind again:<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

I'll try to come up with something more reasonable - at the moment it was pretty much selected on a &quot;I want to get this done tonight&quot; basis :p<br /><br />And your assumption is correct, actually there is a limit of 1000 &quot;events&quot; logged per frame.  The display options do not affect the limit, either.  1000 was probably plenty when only writes were being logged, but with all the new things getting logged, it's clearly not enough.  I'll switch it to being dynamic with no hard limit, instead.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Although maybe some kind of ruler during hblank might possibly be...</div>Not too sure I'm understanding what you mean - maybe adding an optional grid every X clocks would do it?  Slightly unrelated, but I was also thinking of changing the background color for the scanlines where it is safe to run the sprite DMA (which is slightly different between PAL &amp; NTSC, afaik)

Tried the new build, and all events now show <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I figured I would take a closer look at the debugger, and ran into a few issues:<br /><br />First of all, it looks like I cannot set any breakpoints.

		<br />
	</div><br /><br />Furthermore, I figured I would try out the CA65 .dbg file support. And while it mostly works out-of-the-box, some of the results are a bit confusing. Although a disclaimer is in place: I'm not at all familliar with CA65's .dbg files, or how much of the following &quot;bugs&quot; could just be limitations in this format, or bugs in ca65 rather than Mesen. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Anyway, the following code in my .asm file:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">DrawActorsPriorityLevel:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; @priorityLevel = actorFlagsZP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; unused by draw routine<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sta @priorityLevel<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ldx #MAX_ACTORS-1<br />@ActorLoop:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; lda actorAddrHi,x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; beq @NextActor<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; lda actorFlags,x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; and #ACTOR_PRIORITY<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; cmp @priorityLevel<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; bne @NextActor<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; stx TEMP+14<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr DrawActorAnimation<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ldx TEMP+14<br />@NextActor:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; dex<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; bpl @ActorLoop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; rts<br /></div><br /><br />Ends up looking like this in Mesen's debugger:<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<br />
	</div><br /><br />A few problems with these annotations:<br />1) Rather than showing the original &quot;sta @priorityLevel&quot;/&quot;cmp @priorityLevel&quot;, these are shown with the actorFlagsZP variable instead. Now, @priorityLevel is just a local alias for actorFlagsZP, so this isn't a terrible behaviour. But what is curious is that the sta shows the original source-line statement (sta @priorityLevel) as a comment after the line, while the cmp does not. So I am curious what this inconsistency comes from?<br /><br />2) Similarly, the original &quot;lda actorAddrHi,x&quot; statement is shown as a comment after the &quot;LDA $0470,X&quot; statement, while the &quot;lda actorFlags,x&quot; statement does not appear after the &quot;LDA $0410,X&quot; statement. And I see no reason why they should differ - both are originally allocated with a &quot;.res    MAX_ACTORS&quot; statement.<br /><br />3) &quot;numActorsToSpawn&quot; appears out of nowhere, when the source code actually just refers to TEMP+14. numActorsToSpawn is indeed aliased to the TEMP+14 location in a totally different subroutine &quot;LoadMap&quot;. (declared with .proc/.endproc) But the fact that LoadMap uses it for this purpose is totally irrelevant here, and very confusing.<br /><br />4) Even more strange is that the &quot;RTS&quot; statement gets a &quot;YIELD&quot; comment. YIELD is a conditional macro that calls a few sub-routines in my code, and the exact sequence depends on another constant &quot;ACTORCLASS&quot;.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.MACRO YIELD<br />.IF (ACTORCLASS = BLOCK_ACTOR)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr BlockActorYieldSub<br />.ELSEIF (ACTORCLASS = BLOCK_ACTOR_ATTACHED_TOP)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr BlockActorAttachedYieldSub<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr ReadjustBlockActorAttachedTop<br />.ELSEIF (ACTORCLASS = CONSTRUCTION_ACTOR)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr ConstructionActorYieldSub<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr ReadjustY<br />.ELSE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr AnimatedActorYieldSub<br />.ENDIF<br />.ENDMACRO<br /></div><br /><br />...but no matter what ACTORCLASS is set to, the YIELD macro never compiles to just an RTS. So I really don't see where this association that &quot;RTS&quot; == &quot;YIELD&quot; would come from?<br /><br /><br /><br />And another odd mystery is that this code:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.macro WRITE_CHRPAGE page<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ldy #11<br />@loop:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; lda (NMITEMP),y<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; tax<br />.repeat 16,i<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; lda page+$100*i,x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sta $2007<br />.endrep<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; dey<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; bpl @loop<br />.endmacro<br /><br />.SEGMENT &quot;DRAGONCHR&quot;<br />.align $100<br />dragonCHR1:<br />.incbin &quot;dragon1.rhc&quot;<br /><br />dragonCHR2:<br />.incbin &quot;dragon2.rhc&quot;<br /><br />.align $100<br />dragonCHR3:<br />.incbin &quot;dragon3.rhc&quot;<br /><br />WriteChrPageDragon1:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; WRITE_CHRPAGE dragonCHR1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; rts<br /><br />WriteChrPageDragon2:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; WRITE_CHRPAGE dragonCHR2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; rts<br /><br />WriteChrPageDragon3:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; WRITE_CHRPAGE dragonCHR3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; rts<br /></div><br /><br />...results in the code in Mesen looking like so:<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

	</div><br /><br />Or in other words, two of the three macro expansions show up expanded, while the third one results in the macro body embedded as comments.

As far as I know, the DBG file does provide that information, though, so adding support for it would be possible eventually.  This should mostly explain 1 &amp; 3.<br /><br />For 2 &amp; 4, it's been a long time since I coded the CA65 support, so I don't quite remember the conditions for it to display a comment - I'll have to check.<br />Ideally, having the rom, dbg file &amp; source files would be ideal to be able to debug this one, if you're willing to share them, feel free to PM them to me.<br /><br />Edit: To answer your edit about the 3rd macro: Mesen by default only disassembles code that the CPU has actually executed.  There are options to change this though.  In this case, I would assume the first 2 were executed while the debugger was running, but not the 3rd, which is why it's collapsed (light red background = sections that have not (yet) been used as either code or data) . Mesen uses CDL files to track the data/code segments - it's possible that the .dbg files contain enough information to produce a complete CDL file, I'd need to check.
