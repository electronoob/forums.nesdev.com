<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;NMI<br />nmi:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sei<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pha<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;txa<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pha<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tya<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pha<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda $2002<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2006<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2006<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$01<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta &lt;$80<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jsr text_code<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda &lt;$1a<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bne scroll<br /><br />endnmi:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta &lt;$80<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pla<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tay<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pla<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tax<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pla<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rti<br /><br />scroll:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda &lt;$1b<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ora &lt;$17<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;beq goone<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jmp endnmi<br /><br />goone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda &lt;$82<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bne endnmi<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$c1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $c000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $c001<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $e001<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$01<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta &lt;$81<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta &lt;$82<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;cli<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jmp endnmi<br /><br />;IRQ/BRK<br />irq:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sei<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pha<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tya<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pha<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;txa<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pha<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda &lt;$81<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;beq endirq<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $e001<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda $2002<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2006<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2006<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;inc &lt;$30<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda $2002<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda &lt;$30<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2005<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2005<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $e000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta &lt;$81<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta &lt;$82<br /><br />endirq:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pla<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tax<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pla<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tay<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pla<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rti</div>
<br />
<br />Now, the screen <em>does</em> scroll properly, so I know the IRQ is executing, but the scrolling does not split-screen.  Now I did read Kevin's document on the MMC3, but that only talks about the IRQ and not how it relates to scrolling.  Right here:

<br />Perhaps somebody could tell me what I'm doing wrong and perhaps point me in the right direction?  Even better, could they correct my code?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Doesn't look like you're doing anything wrong as far as MMC3 IRQs go.  Although I don't know why you're writing to $E001 in the IRQ routine (since you write to $E000 right after it)
<br />
<br />I'd assume you want to put a status bar or something at the bottom (something that doesn't scroll) based on your dual $2006 writes of 0.  So whatever you're scrolling to in the bottom half of the screen would be at the top of the nametable.  If that's the case, I would do something simple like this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDA #$00<br />STA $2005&nbsp; ; clear fine X scroll<br />BIT $2002&nbsp; ; reset flip-flop &#40;another $2005 write would work too&#41;<br />STA $2006<br />STA $2006&nbsp; ; clear loopy_t and loopy_v&nbsp; &#40;start drawing at very top of nametable at ppu$2000&#41;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Unless you time that to fit in HBlank, the first scanline will be distorted -- so probably have at least a scanline or two which is blank to prevent that disortion from being visible.
<br />
<br />Remember that dual $2005 writes WILL NOT change any vertical scrolling (except at frame start)-- you NEED to write to $2006 for split screen vertical scroll changes.

<br />
<br />Perhaps you could explain it or perhaps you could link me to a document on it?  I tried Kevin's document, which is recommended on this forum, but it does not really explain how to utilize the IRQs to cause split-screen scrolling.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />well I could be more help if I knew what you were trying to do =P.  I mean you already are splitting the screen -- it just sounds like you're not scrolling like you want to (so this is more of a scroll question than an MMC3 question).
<br />
<br />The IRQs themselves don't cause the screen to split -- they just trigger an IRQ at the end of the desired scanline.  You still have to change the scroll values in your code by manipulating $2005/2006.
<br />
<br />Your code IS splitting the screen -- maybe it's not noticable because of how your nametables are set up, but it should be happening:
<br />
<br />- You're setting your screen to draw from ppu$2000 in your NMI routine (by the dual $2006 writes of 0)
<br />
<br />- You set up the MMC3 to trigger an IRQ at the end of scanline 194 (by writing $C1 to the IRQ reload)
<br />
<br />- Then in your IRQ routine, you reset the scroll so that it starts drawing at ppu$2000 again (by the dual $2006 writes of 0)
<br />
<br />- You scroll the bottom of the screen horizontally (but not vertically) by writing to $2005  (however you never seem to reset the fine scroll for the top half of the screen, so does the top half jitter?  Or do you write to $2005 elsewhere (like in text_code)?)
<br />
<br />I don't have any docs to recommend on the subject other than loopy's scrolling doc -- although I don't know if it'd be helpful for you.  Like I said if I knew what you were going for I might be able to help more.  But yeah -- it looks like you are splittnig the screen just fine.

<br />
<br />What do you mean resetting the fine scroll for the top half of the screen?  In my latest code, I do write the scrolling I want for outside the status bar in the NMI, then in the IRQ I simply write zeroes to 2005 twice (so it won't scroll).  It still doesn't work.  When I run it in FCEUXD and open up the Name Table window, I see that the whole screen scrolls to the zero position.  Am I close to what I need to do?
<br />
<br />Also, how do I know how many scanlines I need to start at a particular location?  The IRQ can go up to FF, indicating that it will go through 256 scanlines, but I don't see how there can be that many scanlines.  Each screen has only 30 lines right?

<br />I have read loopy's document, but the way it's written just doesn't make much sense to me.  All it shows is a bunch of register writes that are mostly meaningless to me.  Perhaps it could explain why it's making those register writes, perhaps it can explain exactly what it's doing with each register writes, but the way it's doing it just isn't cutting it for me.
<br />
<br />Oh, by pixel!  Thanks!
<br />
<br />Here's what I'm trying to do:
<br />
<br />The picture I'm scrolling starts at 2800 (lower left nametable) and I'll just scroll it diagonally.  I then want a picture starting at 2000 (upper left nametable) and 6 tiles tall to be at the bottom 6 tiles of the display and not scrolling while the rest of the display (again, starting at 2800) does.  Perhaps through an example of implementing this I can come to understand.

<br />
<br />I sorta know how 2006 fits in with the NMI, you write the address of the nametable you want to display minus 2000 into 2006.  Doing that also sets the origin for the scroll.  You gotta read from 2002 again to reset the bytes for 2005.
<br />
<br />But some things you mention, like coarse and fine scrolling and stuff like that, and also what exactly the IRQ does to prevent a whole part of the display from scrolling, is what's so confusing.  I mean, to do what I stated here:
<br />
<br />The picture I'm scrolling starts at 2800 (lower left nametable) and I'll just scroll it diagonally.

<br />
<br />What do I need to do in the NMI (should I set the values of the part I want to scroll here to 2005/2006?  I know to set the MMC3 stuff here) <em>and</em> the IRQ (should I set the part I don't want to scroll here to 2005/2006?))?  What you've shown me does not seem to be enough information.

<br />
<br />And also, the CPU disables IRQs automatically while the IRQ/NMI is being run.  So the SEI instruction can be dropped there.

<br />The problem is that it sets the whole display to what is specified in the IRQ.  It's like the IRQ takes precedence over the NMI for the whole screen.  Here's a download of the NES file so that you guys can take a look at it:

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The problem is that you are never clearing the I flag <strong>outside of NMI</strong> - when you do CLI at the end of your NMI routine, the RTI shortly afterwards <strong>sets the I flag again</strong>. As such, IRQs will ONLY be serviced at the end of your NMI routine (when the I flag is briefly cleared).
<br />
<br />If your NMI routine is short, you shouldn't even be doing CLI inside in the first place - you should be doing it at the end of your initialization code, right after you enable NMIs (and be sure to write to $E000 before doing CLI, otherwise an unacknowledged MMC3 IRQ might go off).
<br />
<br />The fact that your IRQ handler is being called 6 times in a row means there is probably a flaw in your MMC3 IRQ implementation, since writing to $E000 should acknowledge any pending MMC3 IRQs.

<br />Dur,  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /> I knew that.  Thanks for that info.  I can't believe I missed that.  LOL.
<br />
<br />Still, I'm missing something.  I do have one good piece of news, since fixing that interrupt flag thing, the whole screen is now black.  Now that may not sound so good to you, but if you look at the name tables in the ROM, you'll see that there is no way the whole screen can be black without split-screen scrolling.  So I have implemented it; now I need to figure out how to set the right value.
<br />
<br />Uh, in some experimenation, I ran into some problems.  The display got weird.  Because of that, I'll go ahead and include the source files with the ROM so perhaps you can look at it and tell me how I'm implementing the IRQs wrongly:
