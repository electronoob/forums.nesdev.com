		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I thought this could be useful for anyone that wishes to compile and test their code on the go, or (if they are in my situation) if they are on vacation only having their tablet (phone) running Android.<br />While being on flight I started to learn how Assembly works and wanted to start coding for our beloved NES, but I had to face the problem that there is no specific assembler for Android.  Fortunately, the source code for asm6 is available, and no modification was needed to compile it in order to run on android.<br /><br />At this point I want to point out, that I did not create this program. I just compiled it and want to share it as it might come in handy for one or the other.<br /><br />Setting it up to actually compile something is really not hard, you just need to get Terminal Emulator and place asm6 in the specified folder by TE where executing code is allowed (just look into settings to see which directory enables executing programs). If needed I can write a tutorial for setting everything up.<br /><br />I had no issues assembling code, only debugging is very hard, as there is no debugger for NES on Android, but that is another story.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, here is how to set everything up:<br />1) Get yourself the Terminal Emulator from the Play Store:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jackpal.androidterm">https://play.google.com/store/apps/deta ... ndroidterm</a><!-- m --><br />2) Start the App, and go to Setting<br />3) Scroll down to Shell, there should be an option to setup startup commands, I setup the PATH to point to the folder specified in the settings (this is the only folder where executeables are, well, executeable on non-rooted devices). I will just assume it looks the same on every device, so you could just copy and paste:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">PATH=$PATH:/data/data/jackpal.androidterm/app_HOME/<br />cd /sdcard/ASM</div><br />The cd /sdcard/ASM command points to my .asm files (obviously), so when I start the app, it will directly change the directory to my ASM files<br />4) Back in the Terminal, cd (command for Change Directory) to the directory where asm6 is located (for example cd /sdcard/Download)<br />5) Type in: <div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">cp asm6 /data/data/jackpal.androidterm/app_HOME/asm6</div><br />to copy asm6 to said directory<br />6) now cd to /data/data/jackpal.androidterm/app_HOME/<br />7) type in: <div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">chmod 700 asm6</div><br />This will enable asm6 to be executed<br /><br />Well this should do, after you restart the terminal app, it will automatically set PATH where asm6 is now executeable.<br />Now you also can just type:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">asm6 example.asm example.nes</div><br />And it will output an NES file which will be useable with your favorite NES emulator (I use NES.emu)<br />For ASM editing, I tested several editors, I recommend DroidEdit, it's got a very nice design. You could also use Qedit, it is also decent, but lags at some point.

But on some environments 777 is actually needed/intended, given implementation details (say, through a GUI, a daemon for managing files running as user userA, while a CLI session might be running under userB, but both essentially want to be able to nuke anything in /some/dir).<br /><br />P.S. -- Do not be afraid of octal numbers in chmod.  They're a hell of a lot easier to remember than the weird letter combinations (<tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">r/s/t/w/x/X/u/g/o</tt>), especially since this is a thread about getting an assembler.  If you're afraid of bits or bases you shouldn't be doing assembly ;P  But then again I'm an old UNIX bastard who got used to them a long time ago.

It looks like you have to change byte $10 in the file from 2 to 3 otherwise you get a &quot;position independent executable (PIE) required&quot; error in the terminal, at least on non rooted devices. I found this out after running into this issue after trying to install it on my phone which I have had for a little over a year now and doing some research about how to fix it. Hope that helps people  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
