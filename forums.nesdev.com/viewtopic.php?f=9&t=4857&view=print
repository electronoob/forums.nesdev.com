<br />
<br />I'm wondering if you can include all of the necessary utilities for dumping from previously unknown boards like in the other clients (ex: Bankwatch and Microbug) for the next release. This way we wouldn't have to go back and forth.
<br />
<br />Also when successful plugins are made they should be able to be uploaded to your database for other users to use.
<br />
<br />Also it would be quite convenient to include RAM updating plugins for the LPT CopyNES users so PowerPak ROMs could be updated, etc...
<br />
<br />Looking forward to dumping some carts from newer regions not currently in the database. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A technicality: he hasn't taken the server (specifically the MySQL server) offline, but he *has* removed or done something with the MySQL DB called "cartdb".  For all we know, he could've done "DROP DATABASE cartdb", who knows.  I'm not sure how that has anything to do with him "working on the client".
<br />
<br />If he wants to take the DB offline for whatever purpose, great -- then shut off mysql, or add some hooks in the PHP code to check for a file or global variable that defines whether or not it should even bother with the SQL queries in the first place.
<br />
<br />Spitting back a bunch of MySQL errors at the end-user doesn't give people the impression "things are being worked on".  It gives people the impression something is broken (in this case, a missing MySQL DB).
<br />
<br />Also, I hope someone takes the time to examine the PHP code for any SQL injection attacks.
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />
<br />Seems most of the things I tried failed due to use of mysql_real_escape_string().  What a worthless function to boot -- a proper DBI implementation that offers placeholders would remove such useless functions.  Requiring PEAR or requiring mysqli (which requires SPL) just to get proper prepare() and placeholder support is such a load.  PHP 6 already please!
<br />
<br />Anyway, there are some bugs:
<br />
<br />The Section Browser dumps the section character you want directly from $_GET into the query.  For example, visit:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?browse=%25apes">http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.p ... se=%25apes</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />And you'll end up with this subquery:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">... SELECT c.cartid FROM tbl_carts c,tbl_info i WHERE c.active = 'Yes' AND c.infoid = i.infoid AND i.title LIKE '%apes%' ...</div>
<br />
<br />This piece of the code needs to be changed to only permit certain characters in the $_GET field.  [A-Za-z0-9_-] sounds like a good list.
<br />
<br />Also, in the Advanced Search, probably pertaining to magic_quotes_gpc being turned on.  All PHP configurations at this point in time should have this disabled globally and code developed to assume it's off -- the feature has been removed entirely in PHP 6 due to the security risks of it.
<br />
<br />Repeating the bug is simple.  Advanced Search, Game Title contains: 'FOO', click search, then click back.  Be sure to include the apostrophes in 'FOO'.
<br />
<br />I wonder how many Google results there are for the string "\'".  Good 'ole PHP...

<br />Go Daddy shared hosting forces MQ on. It's on when you sign up, and you can't turn it off in php.ini (no effect) or .htaccess (500 Internal Server Error if i remember correctly). I originally developed my current project with no MQ and had to write a stripslashes loop to work around this when developing my employer's online catalog. Once we outgrew shared hosting and moved to a virtual dedicated server, I breathed a sigh of relief that I didn't have to deal with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VAYd3TWF0U" class="postlink">magic drugs</a> anymore.

<br />Heh, sorry didn't mean to leave you out <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I never really intended the program to be a full-blown client that supports all features of the main client. I agree it is a pain though switching between the 2 because the driver will not allow both to be open at once. It's a possibility down the road though. RAM cart functionality I've considered in the past and probably will add support for it eventually.
<br />
<br />I was going to add an upload form to the plugin page on the website, but the only thing that stopped me is was the question of what do when a user submits a newer version of a plugin? I'd rather there only be 1 version of each. I guess I could have the form there but not have them officially added until they have been reviewed.
<br />
<br />And you can enter new regions now as well <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
