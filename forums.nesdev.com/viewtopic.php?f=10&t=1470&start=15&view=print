<br />I think most newbies get totally lost on the fact that the "technical" side of a game (game engine) and the "design" side of a game (items, characters, gameplay) are absolutely unrelated.
<br />The game engine is a bunch of code that allow the console to take data from its ROM, and from the joypads, and the programm will happen to output the thing you want on the screen and audio speakers. How it is done is the game engine, the technical side of the game, and what appears on the screen in the player point of view are the design side of the game. Both are unrelated.

<br />The 6502 has a mode where arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction) are performed in decimal, rather than binary/hex.
<br />
<br />In hex, adding 05 to 05 will result in 0A. In decimal mode, it will result in 10, using 4 bits to represent each digit. This is called BCD (Binary Coded Decimal).
<br />
<br />It's a shame the NES doesn't have that, it would be very usefull to handle values that must be displayed to the player.

<br />I like it actually !! It add challenge when writing RPGs, forcing you to write routines to convert from hex to decimal, also it would be tough to make sure to not have any errors when doing calculation with decimal variables, including multi-byte addition and sustration, and for RPGs possibly multiplications, etc...

<br />
<br />To Bregalad's comment, I would add that if you want to learn how to be a programmer, writing NES games may not be the easiest place to start.  You need to develop quite a range of skills--you need low-level skills, such as a good understanding of 6502 assembly and you need NES-specific skills and knowledge (such as understanding how the PPU works) and you need some skill at high-level design and coding (in other words--you might want to learn some other languages first such as C, C++ or Java, and learn how the high-level concepts from those languages relate to the low-level workings of a processor such as a 6502).
<br />
<br />Like many other complicated subjects, <a href="http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html" class="postlink">mastering programming takes about ten years</a>.  As a professional programmer with over 10 years experience, I can attest to the truth of this.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />
<br />
<br />Of course its never too soon to start learning, and the best way to learn is by doing.  We only grow by challenging ourselves.

<br />As an ammateur programmer with about 4 years of experience, I think I can be quite close as "mastering" programming (while I'm still not totally "mastering" it, depending of the definition you give to that word).
<br />I think from one to two years is enough to be able to make good programs easily from scratch.

<br />Not impossible, but that can vary a lot from person to person. It took me more than that to learn how to make a decent game. Of course, I learned to program in QBasic, when I was a stupid kid and before there was the internet, it was just harder then.

<br />Absolutely.  You don't need to be an expert at all aspects of programming in order to write good programs, and programmers of all skill levels are going to have some areas they are very familiar with and other areas they are less experienced with.  I don't mean to discourage anyone, either--anyone with the determination to stick with it will be able to learn the necessary skills and be successful.  (What was that famous Thomas Edison quote?  Something about 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":grin:" title="Very Happy" />)
<br />
<br />Bregalad, I'm almost sure you know more about the specific workings of the NES than I do.  I'm trying to write code generators to generate simulation cores for the 6502 (and other processors) but I myself have never written assembly language programs for the 6502.  Which is a skill I would definitely have to develop if I wanted to write NES games rather than emulators.
<br />
<br />Everyone should dream big and chase their dream.  That way lies greatness.  At the same time, most skills worth learning take a lot of time to learn, and most things worth building take a lot of skill and experience to build.  But you've got to start somewhere.  Its good to start with things that are really interesting, so you will have the motivation to keep working on them.

<br />
<br />Yeah, I don't understand it either. I use Wla-Dx, and I really like to use hardcore 6502, and not really stuff that looks like C/C++, like the first or second line of that routine. I was trying to think of a relationship between binary and decimal numbers, but I couldn't come up with one. And I was thinking about Tokumaru's idea, and it's pretty interesting. I don't know how you came up with it though. Tokumaru, if you were to do a 24 bit BDC with your routine, would it require alot of changing?
<br />
<br />EDIT: Well, I just turned your routine into a 24 bit conversion! Looky here: <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.freewebs.com/the_bott/toksroutine.asm">www.freewebs.com/the_bott/toksroutine.asm</a><!-- w --> .

I'm just roughly estimating. It's around there, I bet. What do you think? I mean, let's just face the facts, there is really no lightning fast way to do this. There is much to be done to a binary number to make it output it's decimal equivelant, so I think it's all pretty fast for what it has to do. And for games like Final Fantasy, they wait more than a few frames to load their screens with numbers on them that have been converted from binary, and do you really notice the wait? This is pretty good speed, I think.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Sorry, I meant it takes 5/8ths as long as the original, not it's 5/8th's faster! Sorry!
