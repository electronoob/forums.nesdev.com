I did not upload this video and have no affiliation with whomever did.  Just wanted to share to remind optomon and Thaddeus how appreciated their talents are.   <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpS4XQ1_cHw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpS4XQ1_cHw</a><!-- m --><br /><br />It's very cool to see their hack in action.  The music, art, and style are simply incredible.

I actually had to pause the video several times and count colours + grid layouts to make sure it was authentic.  For a romhack, this is technically very impressive (to me, anyway).

But then again, look at all that magic already happening! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> I wonder how much got made?<br /><br />IMO, the problem with cv2 is not how the enemies where sprited (ok, some looked weird), but that they never posed a threat, ever. The best route to go would probably be to implement a way to shortcut backtracking (map system, portals, something) so it wouldn't feel tedius if the challenge was spiced up a notch. <br /><br />I think the origininal cv2 reuses simon's sprite palette a lot in the background (something i don't take any notice of in the video example of this hack). In cv3 those colours where more complementary to the background, though only shared with some other sprites. <br /><br />==<br />Hi by the way, i'm Ellen and have lurked this forum for years. Just decided to join (and doodle assembly with very limited success).

I remember some screenshots of the forest going around on this forum in the past.<br /><br />EDIT: It was this thread: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=6004">viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=6004</a><!-- l -->. However I now see that it was actually a link to a YouTube video (not the same one as above) that has been taken offline.<br /><br />EDIT#2: Ehh, only now noticed the 2014 posts in this thread, which said pretty much the same thing.
