Exactly, you can use .global as "extern", and .word/.res as the definition in one source file. Unlike with C, though, there's no type information, so for example a buffer size must be stated as a separate constant, whereas in C you could use sizeof. The proposed macro in my previous message (for which I couldn't implement the sizeof part due to ca65 bullshit bugs) was sort of like the attempts in C to have a single file of globals, with a preprocessor flag that either makes it merely declare them, or actually define them.<br /><br />See my earlier warning about my approaches <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />So, I agree; .global is the way to go unless you like experimenting with the language more. Before this thread I only knew about .export and .import, which are much more tedious to use. Of course I assemble most of my programs as a single source file, so don't ever even export any names.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Wed Sep 01, 2010 3:48 pm</p><hr />

I am not the original poster, and I don't intend to hijack this thread nor his question.... but, I have a question relating to the definition and usage of global variables.<br /><br />(ps- I am an accomplished C/C++/asm programmer w/ 20+ years exp)<br /><br />What is wrong with simply using ".globalzp" declarations in a common header file, and then ".word" (or .byte or whatever) in a single ".s" file?  <br /><br />This is analogous to using "int xx = 99;" in a .c file and "extern int xx;" in a .h file (that is included by every .c file, including the one containing 'int xx=99;').<br /><br />The assembler will automatically declare the proper imports and exports in each ".o" file, and the linker will automagically resolve them.<br /><br />What is gained by wrapping it all up in macros?  It seems like an extra (un-needed) layer of abstraction to me.<br /><br />Maybe I misunderstood the original question.<br /><br />Was it a concern for the exact absolute address that the linker would assign to each global, or a concern for syntax of getting ".global / .globalzp" to work at all?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3664">clueless</a> — Wed Sep 01, 2010 2:51 pm</p><hr />

Like mentioned above, every new trial will bring some experience in the end so I wouldn't see it as a waste of time.  If that was the case, I would be crying a lot over all the re-factoring I did recently <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />But right now, the problem is maybe you changed too much thing without knowing the impact of that change. In assembler, this can sometime be lethal (I experienced it many time ;;^_^). My suggestion, although abstract, would be that you first roll back to a previous version that work and do the operation on a few variables that you know would have a visual impact right away if they're not working properly. During that phase, don't focus on the code sharing but on the variable sharing only, which seem to be the one causing issue. Once you figure out the cause, you can reproduce the same thing with another group of variable. You should do it gradually since maybe you did some miss (typo or something) and now you cannot figure out where it is.  Save every interim revision until the end, just in case something goes wrong during the process. <br /><br />I had a few issue like that when converting the FT driver. I was doing it in one shot and couldn't figure out where did I miss.
