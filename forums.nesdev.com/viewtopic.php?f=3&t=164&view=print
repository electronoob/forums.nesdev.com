<br />My question is, are these opcodes present NES CPU?
<br />"undocumented opcodes" document suggests that they are only
<br />available at Atari 8-bit CPU.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Could this be a worth of research? as far as i know, not many emulators
<br />(if any) supports illegal opcodes.
<br />
<br />I see that many illegal opcodes are equivalent to valid opcodes,
<br />i guess it would not matter if they are there or not.
<br />
<br />I've been looking for a subject for my NES program for a quite awhile,
<br />maybe this might be worth of a developement? perhaps a program similar
<br />to NEStress might be usefull for emulator developement?

<br />
<br />But I know at least the Nester family of emus and FCEU emulate them.
<br />
<br />I heard rumors that some GG codes make use of invalid opcodes, but I find that a little far fetched.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The only undocummented opcodes being executed were found in a few asian pirate carts, such as "Donkey Kong Country" (well, double-NOPs to be precise) and in an original japanese title too. Invalid opcodes help to detect bad dumps and/or bugs in an emulator. So, I can't see a reason to get all them emulated, unless an original game requires it (as said before). 
<br />
<br />Like Matt said, they are all there, but it doesn't mean your emu will be f*cking accurate... perhaps the oppositive side. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> Heh, once an UO is executed, something weird might happen.
<br />
<br />Well, the idea is - emulate when required by a game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Having worked (officially) on 3 Nintendo platforms now (GBC, GBA, DS), i can pretty safely assume that NCL/NOA probably did not allow any games to use invalid instructions, else they would fail Lot Check.  Usually they mark these kinds of things as "Reserved" in the programming manuals, stating they are prohibited because they are subject to change in future hardware revisions.
<br />
<br />I wrote some silly voxel rendering code for a game based on a certain Disney aquatic character that used the GBA's SWP instruction as an optimization, and had to ultimately remove it because "its functionality could not be guaranteed by the hardware manufacturer."   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" />
