The next day I realized I forgot to prevent the conflicts and couldn't figure out why it actually did work.  Then it dawned on me how easy it was to prevent bus conflicts when using flash (assuming you've verified it works as you need it to.)

They are pretty vague on how exactly you imagine to implement them since how many of the parts are imaginary at this point...  So there isn't much ability to begin to analyze what will work and what won't.  In general I'd say most of the things you're trying to do are with an underpowered piece of hardware, but I really don't know what half of these ideas are.<br /> <br />Q: Could you possibly somehow, connect two things and have a random PPU register to maybe control something?<br />A: Sure, connect an FPGA to every pin on the NES/FC mobo and you can do anything...
