		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />DevSound is a Game Boy sound driver created by me and pigdevil2010 (a.k.a. Pigu). It can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/DevEd2/DevSound" class="postlink">https://github.com/DevEd2/DevSound</a>. DevSound is a fairly advanced sound driver which was originally designed for use in games, but I feel it's shaping up to be a viable competitor to LSDJ. However, unlike LSDJ there is currently no editor; the only way to compose for DevSound is to write the music data manually. Eventually, I plan on creating a proper tracker for DevSound (which will run on a computer rather than on hardware).<br /><br />Since there's been a bit of discussion about DevSound here lately (specifically in <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=16787" class="postlink">this thread</a>), I thought I'd go about creating a proper thread for it. Feel free to ask questions and/or suggest features and/or bugfixes in this thread.

This way, people who have problems getting DefleMask Tracker to run properly (as I've gathered from the FamiTracker community Discord server) can at least have a composing tool to work with.

This is what ft2pently does to work around the vast difference in drum representation between FamiTracker and Pently.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Another alternative is to write a MML compiler</div><br /> MML is better than hardtyping hex, and writing a py script converting MML strings to hex data would be easier than writing or repurposing a tracker.<br />But unless writing MML music for its own sake (pc speaker music for example), i can't recommend it. I think MML sequencing would be a bit of a jail sentence for the driver, dramatically put. I can only speak for myself, but i could come nowhere close to what sort of music i'd like to make if i had to write, compile, listen, write, compile, listen; all while constrained by the interface for inputting MML code in np++. Haven't done that since qBasic and i'm glad i haven't returned. :S I think a lot of other hobbyist composers like me without years of dedicated studies and training in music theory need direct aural feedback and be able to edit during playback in order to do their best. Still others may be fine, but then you've narrowed an already slim user base significantly (while expanding it vs. byte typing).

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As it is, I have a series of macros that are designed to make composing with DevSound more than just writing hex. For example, you can actually type notes (e.g. C_3 or F#5) rather than their raw hex value. Pretty much every feature of DevSound can be used in this way; all commands have a &quot;mnemonic&quot; assigned to them such as SetInstrument or EnablePWM.<br /><br />I decided against an MML compiler early on because A) it would be no better than just writing it in the standard text format, and B) I personally dislike MML because it's not a &quot;direct&quot; means of composing. I prefer trackers because you can actually hear the music as you're writing it. The way I see it, in terms of DevSound MML would be just another text format to learn. I would prefer a more WYSIWYG solution for DevSound composing.

But because this issue cross-cuts all drivers that use MML as input, I'll make a new topic about making the MML editing process more practical.<br /><br />EDIT: <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=211438#p211438" class="postlink">Here's the new topic</a>
