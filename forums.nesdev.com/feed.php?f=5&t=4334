Some systems have only 192 scanlines, after using some for a status bar only about 160 are left for the game, and many games like that exist.<br /><br />Anyway, I wasn't talking about a game, just a dynamic demo, where the frames wouldn't need to be pre-stored in the ROM. Although I think Another World uses the polygon engine through the whole game, and it worked out pretty well.<br /><br />I understand why it wouldn't work in your case... The CPU is already pretty busy as it is, if it had to process game logic as well, it'd run at 1 FPS, like you said.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Sep 24, 2008 11:09 pm</p><hr />

Theoretically, you could generate a dynamic scene to RAM and have your engine render that data. The only problems I see are the extra time needed to create the scene (too much time is already spent rendering it), and the lack of complexity checks (to make sure no more than 256 tiles are used).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Sep 24, 2008 10:48 pm</p><hr />

I will admit, those demos are extremely cool! The best thing I've made on QBasic was my wireframe 3D simulator. It was like yours, but it didn't have mouse support or different colors. But you could spin the models around and move them all about. Oh, and there was no polygon filling as I didn't know how to do any at the time.<br /><br />But my polygon engine wouldn't be able to do those simply because it assumes everything is pre-defined. And overlapping polygons of the same color cause major issues with the filling routine. I originally planned on having 3D sequences, but then over the course of about 6 months I concluded several things about this weren't necessary for making a polygonal sequences.<br /><br />Making a demo like that on the NES would be cool, but like tokumaru said, I'm not into making random demos that I'm not going to use for anything besides just being a demo.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Wed Sep 24, 2008 10:36 pm</p><hr />

This is one of the problems with the engine... I really don't think I have enough CPU time to sacrifice to check and see if I can reuse tiles for things like completely horizontal/vertical lines. Though there is somewhat of a solution, and I use it for things like the tree trunks.<br /><br />Only the first four tiles are reused, yes. If I have large polygons that are filled with one solid color, it would be a really bad idea to use all "unique" tiles to do it. So I use those 4 tiles for solid areas in the middle of a large polygon. And also, I define absolutely no completely vertical lines. In order to define a square, I have to define the top and bottom borders of it. If I make it start at  an X coordinate that's a multiple of 8, and if I make it a multiple of 8 pixels wide, I can fill it with those solid tiles all the way down besides the top/bottom lines. This saves tiles, and I do it with the tree trunks. Check all the tiles in FCEUXD; They are almost completely made up of one of the first 4 tiles.<br /><br />But in a lot of cases, I can fine tune the graphics to use less tiles. If I have a line with a slope of 1, there is one condition where it can use half as many tiles as it ever does. If the line cuts exactly across the tile from the top left corner to the bottom right, then it will use much less tiles. If it's slightly off, it will use twice as many! There are many tricks like this to reduce the amount of space used.<br /><br />I'll most likely program my application to warn me if all tiles are used up, or anything like that. But most of the frames will have side-by-side polygons sharing many tiles. So this isn't SO much of an issue right now. I don't plan to have REALLY complex frames, as this isn't so possible with only 256 tiles.<br /><br />Oh, and it also helps that there are lots of long horizontal lines in this, and I currently have to define every one with unique tiles. However, I have an idea for a solution of this. I'll have a special command in my line definitions that tells to draw a row or column of solid tiles instead of using unique tiles. Though this would take an extra byte as a line definition, it would save me lots of pattern table space.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Tue Sep 23, 2008 10:42 pm</p><hr />

I must admit it is pretty cool to know that this scene was drawn dynamically! However, I am concerned about tile usage... when I look at the tiles that were generated for this picture, I can see that 3/4 of the pattern table were used, even though the image looks pretty simple, with lots of flat areas. It might be hard to keep them inside the limits once there are characters moving around and all that.<br /><br />BTW, how do you know when to reuse tiles and when to create new ones? I'm really curious about that! Are only the first 4 reused or is there a more complex system?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Sep 23, 2008 10:11 pm</p><hr />

So I haven't created an application to make my frames, but I made one by hand today. I definitely need an application, because I've been working on this so long that I'm starting to get dizzy! But here's a legit frame:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.freewebs.com/the_bott/Polygon.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The ROM that produced this image:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.freewebs.com/the_bott/Polygon.nes">http://www.freewebs.com/the_bott/Polygon.nes</a><!-- m --><br /><br />It will look a lot better once I have a program that will make it easier. But I think it's pretty cool for being all polygons with 1 palette!<br /><br />I plan to have a shot like this, but when I add support for sprites (Both polygonal and predefined (I'll also add support for predefined BG tiles)), I plan to have the moon behind the building with clouds moving by that will appear behind the BG. These, I will probably have predefined, as the moon wouldn't look good made like an octagon. Though perhaps I'd have polygonal clouds to have that "glass" effect when they pass over the moon.<br /><br />I worry though that it may look too much like cut out construction paper like the cartoon South Park. But I think this won't be as much of an issue once I have it actually moving "3-dimensionally".<br /><br />EDIT: Oh, and this frame between 2 planes is 255 bytes (coincidence). It's 146 for color plane 1, and 99 for color plane 2. If this were all predefined, it would be much larger! There are some parts where I needlessly define "Start of new polygon" and stuff like that, so it's probably more like 245 bytes. It should also be noted that each plane separately has a maximum size of 255 (or 256, I don't know, I have trouble with the whole counting starts at 0 thing sometimes) bytes, so frames can be fairly complex. Though there's always 3 bytes used in the first plane, and 1 in the second. 1 in each is to define the number of lines being drawn.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Tue Sep 23, 2008 9:39 pm</p><hr />
