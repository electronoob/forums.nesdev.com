<br />Isnt the idea of life that its unfair. Ya I know its unfair......but it is. Also note the sarcasm notes at the communist remark...how old are you btw...no offense I find it hard to imagine anyone over 18 to not know what communism is (no offense here)

<br />Many of the people I know would fall into that category. Granted, they had to go through school to get there, but they seem to enjoy their work. Isn't that the difference between a job and a career, the enjoyment?
<br />
<br />If not then I need to change my major to something less enjoyable. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />edit: I know the topic is nesdev, but your comment seemed aimed at work in general. If not, then my mistake.

It's okay for me to have this goal, because like a lot of other people, I don't want to be condemned to do the same boring crap every day for the rest of my life until I die after living the average life span. Though once I achieve this goal, I will make movies, books, games, music, and lots more (so I'll do work, it will be mostly for my own benefit though). Then of course I'll buy myself a huge house with a roller coaster inside and lots of sound proof rooms  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> .
<br />
<br />And whether or not you're 18 has nothing to do with your understanding of communism. There are plenty of things I don't understand about life that are supposedly common sense that I apparently should understand by this point. Some things are just harder to understand than others. I myself don't fully understand communism.

If anyone wants to make commercial games, I'm not standing against them, but they should definitely be making games that are actually commercialisable like PS3, XBox360, Wii, DS, or PC games (possibly GBA but I doubt). Not NES games, as much as I like these they are not commercial anymore and shoudn't be IMO.
<br />
<br />I'm currently 19 and yes I know about communism I just don't understand exactly what it is. Of course I am supposed to have learned it at scool, but I almost only listened to math courses.

<br />1) Very few people will actually buy it -&gt; your chances to make a living are slim to none
<br />2) Chances are that it will be considered rare and that people will sell it more expensive than the original price on ebay, something I would personally have if the game was mine
<br />3) You are getting informations, help and progamming tools on the internet by people who shared that freely and you use that to make money, which I consider dishonnest. If anyone release a game chances are that people writing tile editors and assember, as well as people that answers to questions asqued on the internet, are as much responsible in the release than the coder.
<br />4) If everyone had that mentaily, we would then have to buy emulator, romhacks, roms, etc... and in the end it would be detestable, I'd just play modern games that come out they have better <span class="posthilit">graphics</span> and would be almost less expensive at that rate
<br />5) Where is the fun ? I love programming and such. After all a game is a work of art, and I personally think an artistic ideal should become before money.
<br />
<br />Wanting to be a sersious money maker when coding a game for a completely obsolete machine just doesn't feel right. Especially

Those people who answered the questions that the programmer had play a big part in the production of that game. Though it may be small in comparison to what work the programmer did.
<br />
<br />I sort of agree with number 4 and 5 too. But I'm not as passionately adamant about them.

<br />But look at the emergence of GNU/Linux and FreeBSD into a world dominated by commercial UNIX. This shows shows that not every developer will have that mentality.
<br />
<br />There's nothing wrong with making or taking a Free engine and then putting proprietary assets on top of it. The ability to <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html" class="postlink">combine free software with other value-added products or services</a> is one of the main draws of free software.

<br />"Geminim"? Just find one of the other ten billion variations of Nim (or don't bother, since it's solved)
<br />
<br />Siamond? There are a billion clones of Simon already, just go find one of those.
<br />
<br />Mystic Pillars? Play Magic Jewelry instead. Or hell, Columns on the Genesis or Game Gear/MS.

<br />Charging money for these things -- Literally half the price of a <em>brand new game</em> for PS3/XB360/etc -- is ... prohibitively expensive.
