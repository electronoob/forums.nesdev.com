When your game's cabinet is as physically imposing as a <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em> or other 2-player Bemani game, sparing no expense for audio is justified. But not all games are that big.

It actually reminds me a lot of a lower quality GBA game. I've know of several arcade machines with the OKI6295, but none of them rely on it solely, usually pairing it with the YM2151 (CPS1). I can't believe how long it lasted though considering how low spec it is (look at the dates of some of these games): <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://vgmrips.net/packs/chip/okim6295">http://vgmrips.net/packs/chip/okim6295</a><!-- m -->?<br /><br />I actually downloaded the rom for the game and looked at it in MAME, and it turns out that this doesn't actually have 3BG layers; it only has two. One of the layers appears to use 8x8 tiles, while the other appears to use 16x16. The status bar is actually just sprites; 8x8 numbers used to represent the score are actually 16x16 sprites, which seems like a huge waste of bandwidth. The game didn't ever actually have sprite dropout of any kind, despite how heavily it relies on sprites. (Several large background elements in the game are even made of sprites) You know Sega would have relegated this hardware to puzzle games only. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">ccovell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Who knows what Mitchell were thinking?</div><br />It appears to be Data East's arcade machine that Mitchell just used. I'd ask what Data East was doing first. It actually appears they had an otherwise identical arcade machine aside from the sound hardware that was released earlier: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://system16.com/hardware.php?id=954">http://system16.com/hardware.php?id=954</a><!-- m --> It's still 8 channels, but it sounds clearly better:  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QCD8u-3YTw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QCD8u-3YTw</a><!-- m --> Of course, both companies weren't exactly rich, so they had to work with &quot;substandard&quot; hardware.

Then, the horror began.<br /><br />The GB game started running, of course, but what came out of my TV's speakers was not GameBoy sound, but a horrible screechy 'song' played as a looped sample at about 4khz... So, the reports were true; this thing didn't emulate the GB sound at all. In fact, total silence is preferrable to this song... What were they thinking???&quot;<br /><br />Trivia time: the horrible sound from the GB Hunter seems to be a rendition of &quot;That's the Way It Is&quot;, a C-64 tune.  It's just a bit hard to recognize.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, this is relevant to arcade machine hardware, although not the discussion of that Data East arcade machine: Do most of the arcade game boards from the late 80's and early 90's generally use some sort of (physically) standard sized rom chips? (Seems like piracy would be really easy though if this is the case, so probably not.) I've always wanted to own an arcade board, but while I regularly see deals for system boards with shitty games for less than $250, the games you'd actually want to buy the system for go for well over $500, with few exceptions. In addition, it's almost impossible to get game boards by themselves for some reason, unless the ratio of system pcbs to game pcbs is roughly 1:1. I'm hoping I can get a $50 eeprom programmer and a bunch of eeprom chips and make a few games; I don't know if I'm being delusional about this, because I've never had any experience with this exact sort of thing.<br /><br />What would be really neat is a device that uses a USB port (or several) that splits the signal to be massively parallel to where you could put a wire in every slot for every rom chip on the game board. You could then hook it up to a Raspberry Pi and make a &quot;SD to CPS1&quot; or something like that. Probably wouldn't work for about 1000 different reasons though. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />...Old systems with palette rom, I imagine, would actually be able to play 60fps, full color FMV then... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

Luckily, so does this:<br /><br /><img src="http://videogamecritic.net/images/systems/gencontroller.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Because the controller port is identical to a serial port (?) you could just get a male to female serial port cable and stick the wires from the Jamma harness accordingly. (I have no idea how the six button controller works)<br /><br /><img src="http://www.haku.co.uk/pics/SegaJoypadPinout.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Your power supply is going to have to supply 5V anyway, so that's fine. The real problem seems to be a video converter; I'd have thought it'd be all be analog, but all the devices I've seen appear digital, which more than likely means there's going to be lag. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /> Does anyone have any suggestions?<br /><br />Edit: Wait, I'm an idiot, looking at the schematic, even with the standard controller, some buttons share the same pins somehow. Darn.<br /><br />Edit 2: Actually, I'm not sure... I've found some stuff that seems to imply each button has one pin assigned to it, and I have no idea what &quot;select&quot; means on the above picture.

It switches the A, B, C, and Start lines between two of the pairs of buttons. On the 6-button controller, it switches more lines if toggled multiple times within a millisecond. (<a href="https://segaretro.org/Six_Button_Control_Pad_(Mega_Drive)#Technical_Information" class="postlink">Source</a>)<br /><br />Your JAMMA harness will need a circuit that toggles Select, latches the output in both states, and relays it to the system board.
