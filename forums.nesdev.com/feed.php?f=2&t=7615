I made the enemy save the players momentary position as his target, then try to line up either X or Y first (first direction is chosen randomly) and then line up the other direction until he reaches his target. By the time he reaches his target position, the player may be long gone, so then he takes the player's new momentary coordinates as his new target.<br />This far I have done and it's working quite ok, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/picccca/nes/nighttime-bastards/download/main-06-04-2011.nes" class="postlink">here is a ROM</a> so you can see for yourself.<br /><br />Then I was thinking that when the enemy hits a wall, he will move kind of randomly for a while, maybe some few seconds or so, after which he will save a new target and try again. This might work with the level design I use, I still need to try this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4638">picccca</a> — Mon Apr 11, 2011 5:51 am</p><hr />

I only made algorithems that a list of paths are made and it takes which one is the shortest path to get to the target, the enemy. it also compensated for if the player is going up at the time or down. Note that this might suck as an idea for the cpu time required for making a path and calculating the shortest distance. but you could hard map some paths. but still.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4842">gamax92</a> — Sun Apr 10, 2011 12:45 pm</p><hr />

Truly random movement is kind of annoying and dumb looking, in my opinion.  The standard method of "pick random direction, walk, pick another random direction" usually results in a lot of fiddly walking in circles.<br /><br />One good method to circumvent this that I once used is to store the current walking direction for each enemy, and randomly modify it to the left or right.  0-32 = up, 33-64 = right, 65-96 = down, 97-128 = left, or break it into diagonals if you're using them.  Add some amount like 8 if they randomly turn right, subtract if they turn left.  This results in wide snaking paths (more apparent with diagonal movement).<br /><br />Another method that I that I think I like better is like the target-based Pac-Man method.  It works better as a general method for all pathfinding.  In a nutshell:<br /><br />All monsters have a target x/y value on the map that they are trying to reach at all times.  This can be the player, updated whenever the player moves, or maintained as the "last seen" position of the player before he moved out of sight.  The target can also be a random location when you want them to move randomly, they'll seem to move purposefully toward a certain room or location.<br /><br />Monsters have a flag indicating horizontal or vertical movement that alternates every turn.  Movement in a direction can fail if it would result in hitting a wall or the x/y value is already correct (equal to their target's x/y value).  If x movement is attempted toward the target and fails, the flag is not updated and y movement is attempted instead.  If both movements fail, it will randomly choose a new target some distance away from its current location.<br /><br />This way monsters will follow walls and corridors to get to their target if need be, and eventually give up and start walking randomly.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3438">UncleSporky</a> — Mon Apr 04, 2011 7:01 am</p><hr />

I have experience implementing games on other platforms (mostly rogue likes) and in my experience A* pathfinding is rarely needed for a game. Think about how often you will actually need pathing to overcome your level design, then think about how it will impact the game if the enemy gets stuck. Most of the time getting stuck is not going to break your game or give your player a bad experience.<br /><br />If you actually do need A* pathing you can break it up over several frames. Because the algorithm is stack-based as long as you do not overwrite the stack between frames you can pick up where you left off and process another N path tiles. Besides, your enemies will not need to update their destination every frame. Every 10 or 20 should be enough even for a fast game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3706">qbradq</a> — Sat Apr 02, 2011 10:48 am</p><hr />

I did something like this for my Minesweeper clone, I think it could be used for this, although might be very slow and maybe not possible on the NES.<br /><br /><br />What you'd do is read the square the person is on. Read every square around him (8 squares) save the ones that haven't been checked and can be moved on in an array. Repeat until one of them ends up on square you want. That will be the shortest path. Although I can't think of a good way to implement this ATM.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Sat Apr 02, 2011 8:47 am</p><hr />

I don't know how much searching can be done in the roughly 30,000 cycles between one NMI and the next. That's why I keep recommending <a href="http://c2.com/xp/DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html" class="postlink">simpler things that might work</a>, and that's why I keep asking questions to rule out those simpler things.

Yes, I considered the method where the enemy moves directly in the players direction. If enemy x-pos is less than player x-pos then the enemy simply moves right to increase its x-pos, but then enemies will get stuck behind obstacles, even if they are programmed to turn when colliding with a obstacle. Consider this figure:<br /><br /><img src="https://sites.google.com/site/picccca/nes/stuff/pathfinding.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The enemy is in tile A, the target (player) is in tile B. Because B x-pos is greater than A x-pos the enemy will go right and basically get stuck. I think I need more intelligent enemies than this. That's why I asked about the path finding algorithms and if you have used them and what was the result, or are these algorithms (A*, Breadth-first search...) overkill for the NES?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4638">picccca</a> — Sat Apr 02, 2011 7:33 am</p><hr />

I'm thinking that this algorithm is a quite massive operation for the NES to handle, but I might be wrong.<br /><br />So, I guess what I'm asking here is that you share your experience with these path finding algorithms.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4638">picccca</a> — Sat Apr 02, 2011 6:15 am</p><hr />
