I find Double Dragon 2 as an arcade game to be an unplayable disaster of slowdown, shitty hit detection / hitboxes and mediocre animations. The FC/NES game, on the other hand, feels very responsive, I can see where everything is, the slowdown isn't there, and the animations are consistent (Just look at the &quot;getting hit and falling over&quot; animation from the arcade VS the FC title). I like the harsh contrast graphic style that was adopted to make do with the reduced color depth.<br />Oh, and the FC sound effects sound good unlike the arcade one where I am fairly sure the sound designer farted into a tape recorder at various speeds to create the sounds.<br /><br /><br />Turtles in Time for SFC I like more not just because of the extra stages and such, but rather because throwing enemies was changed from being random to an actual intended action - in the SFC version, the playe rmust walk over an enemy while it is in its keeled-over state and then press the attack button, optionally holding forward to determine the throw type. The arcade version is just stupid and randomized.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5314">mikejmoffitt</a> — Thu Nov 28, 2013 10:40 am</p><hr />

I definitely agree with Soul Calibur for DC, hands-down better than arcade. I also like Super-C / Contra better than arcade Contra, and NES Double Dragon (all of them) better than arcade Double Dragon (all of them).<br /><br />I also thought Final Fight for SNES was much better than the arcade machine, mainly because of the difficulty tweaks. This may have been a result of the arcade owner being a bastard and having the difficulty dips set all the way up, dunno.<br /><br />I also thought the Atari 2600 version of Asteroids was better than the arcade version, but I think that may have something to do with my tiny infant brain thinking &quot;COLOR BETTER THAN NO COLOR!!!&quot; Either way it's got tight controls and freak-awesome sound.<br /><br />There's a few games that I thought were best in the arcades. For instance, Rygar is my favorite arcade original, and even though it was ported to nearly every contemporary platform they all suck the poo.<br /><br />I also once played what I think is the VS Unisystem version of Super Mario Brothers, and I recall being enthralled with the minor differences in level 1-1. This thread has brought back that vague memory. I'm going to have to check that rom out now <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3706">qbradq</a> — Mon Nov 25, 2013 6:39 pm</p><hr />

The composition is just legendary.<br /><br />Though many people considered its gameplay not as good as the arcade version (mainly for the removal of 2-player mode and the dragons are no longer &quot;double&quot;), I personally regarded it as a step forward as I quite liked its level up system (though it could be abused so that it's easy to level up close to max level in the first stage).<br /><br /><br />The Famicom version of Double Dragon 3 though, was 999999999999999999999 times better than the arcade version.

Well, you say it yourself: First the FDS version, then MSX. Then, much later, the arcade version.<br />Ergo: NES-original.<br />O.k., Famicom-original, but I don't distinguish between NES and Famicom games.<br /><br />What companies internally intended cannot be said for sure. All that counts is what was actually released. And in this case, while &quot;Contra&quot; and &quot;Gradius&quot; clearly have their roots in the arcade and &quot;Metal Gear&quot; is from the MSX, &quot;Castlevania&quot; is the one Konami series where the original game indeed came out for NES hardware.<br />O.k., the MSX version lost just by a month. But since the NES game is clearly the superior game and since all subsequent games follow from the NES version, I guess we can say that the NES game deserves its first place of being the original ur-&quot;Castlevania&quot;.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6156">DRW</a> — Thu Nov 21, 2013 5:41 pm</p><hr />

Even Castlevania was not so straight NES original. It first released for FDS, but just month later alternative version (Vampire Killer) was released for MSX2. It only got to the NES next year after these two, and shortly after this another alternative version, Haunted Castle, was made for the arcade. So maybe they not actually intended to release the console version first.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Thu Nov 21, 2013 5:18 pm</p><hr />

No. It's just a coincidence:<br /><br />When I digged out &quot;Paperboy&quot;, I became aware that the NES and the Game Boy version are basically alike. And since in another thread I played with the thought to program a game and use the same game logic code on the NES and the Game Boy (which, as the others told me, isn't really possible after all), I was curious which other games are equal nevertheless.<br /><br />About the Konami stuff: Konami seems to be the biggest developer and publisher of NES games. No other company had more games (apart from Nintendo itself of course). And I wanted to see if they actually have a well-known franchise in their NES and Famicom list that is not based on a non-videogame license and that is not an arcade port.<br />But interestingly, as far as I see, the &quot;Castlevania&quot; games are the only very well-known Konami games that are NES originals.<br />&quot;Contra&quot;: Arcade port.<br />&quot;Gradius&quot;: Arcade port.<br />&quot;Turtles&quot;, &quot;Goonies&quot; etc.: Licensed from a non-game franchise.<br />For some reason, even though Konami was such an active developer, &quot;Castlevania&quot; is the only franchise that is well-known, invented by Konami and where the first game is really original and native to the NES.<br />That's what I wanted to verify: I wanted to see if there is another Konami franchise that originated on the NES or Famicom.<br /><br />And the question about arcade/console comparisons, this is a subjective thing anyway and I wanted to hear other people's opinions, after I became aware that I like the NES &quot;Paperboy&quot;, but I don't like the arcade &quot;Paperboy&quot;.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6156">DRW</a> — Thu Nov 21, 2013 5:02 pm</p><hr />
