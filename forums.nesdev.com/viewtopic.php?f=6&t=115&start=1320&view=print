<br />
<br />Isn't the NTSC Version of Castelian = Kyoro Chan Land?
<br />
<br />If so, The NTSC one is ripped under the name of the Japanese version!
<br />
<br />Alfred Chicken is also PAL, But as far as I know, is a European-only NES game. Same with Jimmy Connors Tennis. it is a PAL-Exclusive as far as I know.

Also, Nick Eastridge didn't answer the phone so I left him a message so hopefully he calls me back. If not I will call him again. I sent him an e-mail before but he never got back to me. Call me crazy but I like the music of the Mindscape developed games.

<br />UPDATE: Nick Eastridge answered the phone today, but he said he never worked on games, so the programmer that gave me the link to this guy's site probably didn't know either.
