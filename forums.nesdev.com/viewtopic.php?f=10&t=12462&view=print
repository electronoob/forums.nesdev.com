		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi! I'm very new to NES and 6502 programming, and many of the tutorials I've read reference relatively modern tools like YY-CHR and ASM6. These tools are good, but I would like to know which assemblers and sprite editors, if any, were used to create real NES games like <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> and such in the 1980's. If they are available for download today, can you send me a link to download? Thanks in advance to anyone who replies.

I know I'm not helping much, but I typed in stuff like &quot;original nes development tools&quot; on Google, but I got nothing. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> I wouldn't be surprised if many developers made their own development kits, and I doubt Nintendo is going to distribute theirs. (I don't even know how people managed to get development manuals from them.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Often the &quot;tools&quot; were just a paper and pencil, and the data typed in by hand as hexadecimal. It wasn't uncommon at all at the time for tools to be non-software. (This is still viable today too, though it may not be the best approach.)<br /><br />I forget what games they were for, but I've definitely seen development photos of grid/graph paper with pixels shaded in to represent a sprite and hex numbers representing the data next to them.<br /><br />Some composers just would try ideas at their synthesizer keyboard, then go to a text editor and type in notes/durations right into the source code.<br /><br /><br />Of course, others did have tools. Monkey Island's character <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guybrush_Threepwood" class="postlink">Guybrush Threepwood</a> earned his name because of a naming convention for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluxe_Paint" class="postlink">Deluxe Paint</a> files, which was a program they were using for their art. There were lots of art packages available for computers in the 80s, a lot of them would do fine for sprite artwork. You might write a converter, or you might just make your sprite and work out the compiled data by hand. An automated compilation tool isn't really needed until you have to do a lot of it. (A lot of game composers similarly worked with MIDI software to help them compose.)<br /><br />There was a talk given by Rob Hubbard, having trouble finding a video just now, but he described that he basically made a version of his music engine that played a loop of music on the C64 while letting him edit the hex stream of data for that loop. He could work on that loop while listening to it, and when it was ready he would just save off that loop and move on to the next one. Eventually we would have enough loops to put together to make a finished tune with.

It looks like neither can be downloaded from these links, but if it's not available elsewhere and it's allowed, I could upload them here.  tUME is already on the nesdev front page, but it's only a link to an dead site (I'm not sure why I didn't upload the file at the time).<br /><a href="http://games.greggman.com/game/tume___the_universal_map_editor/" class="postlink">tUME</a><br /><a href="http://www.neswarpzone.com/colordreamsshrine1/nindraw.html" class="postlink">NinDraw</a><br /><br />It's not software, but I have a hardware device made in 1992 by Parallax called TurboROM.  It's an EPROM emulator.  I doubt it was used professionally for NES programming, but it's about old enough to have been possible.

Games made today are as real as games made in the 80's. They exist and they run on the NES... which makes them real NES games. I'd say &quot;official&quot; was a better word, but even in the 80's not all games were official, and what homebrew programmers do today (use whatever tools are available to program the games and put them on cartridges) isn't much different from what unlicensed developers did back in the day.<br /><br />That being said, in the early days of the NES, a lot of things were done by hand. Most people didn't even have computers in their offices. Sometimes the only real tool they had was an assembler, and most of the data was either inputted by hand or generated by simple tools coded by the developers themselves. As time went by, things became less precarious, but the tools were still not nearly as versatile as what we have today.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If they are available for download today, can you send me a link to download?</div><br />We've had access to pictures from magazines and such where we can see some of the tools being used (for example, scroll halfway down <a href="http://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/weekly/Stars_of_the_Family_Computer.html" class="postlink">this page</a> and you'll see SMB3 sprites being edited), but I don't think we ever had access to any of the software. Also, the computers used by companies weren't PCs, or any other kind of personal computers regular people would have at home, so whatever software you might find will definitely not work natively on your computer, and there probably aren't any emulators for those machines since they were only used by companies.<br /><br />More oldschool software can be seen <a href="http://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/weekly/How_Games_Are_Made_DQVI_2.html" class="postlink">here</a> (although this is about a SNES game).

The main differences between homebrew programmers and developers of unlicensed games are that homebrew programmers usually have less hours, work under less pressure, and have more creative freedom. That's not set in stone though... some people have more free time and/or are more focused than others, and homebrew programmers who take commissions will certainly be under more pressure and have less creative freedom.
