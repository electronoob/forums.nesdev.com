I don't think I've actually seen any game have a gradient like that on the text, the closest I can think of is SF2 that has the gradient going diagonal. I could have made the gradient go out in a better circle, but it looked really awkward in spots. I didn't actually modify anything after laying it.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

I got rid of the second closest color to white and replaced it with white, and then I adjusted the middle color to where it is a little closer to the color above it than below it in terms of brightness.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />On the SNES it sounds very wastefully to not use a 2BP layer for the font. I guess it depends on which more you are, but assuming you're using mode 1, you really want to put your font on the last BG in order to reduce VRAM usage. Well some games like DQ6 actually uses the high color layers for the font even though it's monochrome, so maybe this somehow made sense for them ?

Because I predominately want to use 16x16 and 32x32 sized sprites, I've thought of a system where instead of changing sprite tile numbers, you just update the tile data itself. Most games even have information stacked on top of itself, so if you had a score bar with 8 digits, that's 4 sprites, and you still got the 8 8x8 tiles on top. This system takes up both less sprites and almost always less tiles. The only disadvantage is using VBlank time to update the tile data, but this is hardly anything, as you only need to update what has changed from the previous frame.<br /><br />Even if I were using BG 3 for the score board, I'd use HDMA to make  a vertical gradient. I showed how you can pretty much recreate the Metal Slug scoreboard.

Very unimportant background, or special lighting effects ? Also, keep in mind the SNES can only output 32 8x8 sprites per line and that all bigger sprites are internally converted to 8x8 sprites. This is a pretty serious limitation if you want a HUD with sprites and it takes the whole screen horizontally, a couple of any additional sprites and they'll already start to disappear. If only part of the screen is used for a HUD then it's fine.

Just look at Donkey Kong Country:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.dkc-atlas.com/media/graphics/backgrounds/dkc/forest.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://www.dkc-atlas.com/media/graphics/backgrounds/dkc/temple.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://www.dkc-atlas.com/media/graphics/backgrounds/dkc/snow-sky.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If only part of the screen is used for a HUD then it's fine.</div><br />I mean, this is mainly how it goes. I actually just created a mockup HUD for the heck of it. (There'd be more information in a real game like lives, but I'd have them on top of that stuff.) I always think it's funny how vertical shooters almost always put the HUD on the top of the screen, when the majority of the action is on the top of the screen but there's almost always nothing on the bottom. The HUD takes up 24 of 34 tiles horizontally, which isn't bad because if I were to use it for a vertical shooter, 90% of enemies never even reach this far down the screen because they're either dead or have turned around. It's pretty unlikely you'll be that far down the screen either, and you could even make it to where you can't be.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
