		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was talking about your actions on this forum. Putting a person down is an action. Several times you've posted messages putting down other people. That may not have been your intent, but it's what you posted. You've edited some of them so I can't show you what I mean anymore. I wasn't claiming your purpose, since I can't know that. All I'm asking is that you stop starting threads where you open by putting down some person because of their skill level at something or the way they programmed something. If you want to critique their work, fine, but stop putting the people themselves down.
<br />
<br />Now, I'm sure you or someone else is all ready to retort that in this very thread I'm putting you down, where I referred to you as the pot calling the kettle black. That referred to the fact that you were putting down these SMW people for their errors, while you made at least two English errors in your own posting, one very obvious. The point is that you didn't need to be putting those people down in the first place; doing something offensive like that opens you to a higher level of criticism.
<br />
<br />I've done my share of being mean to people here, I've apologized for plenty of incidents, and if anyone wants to bring up an issue with me, I will discuss it. I don't appreciate random attacks as Bregalad made above, and I don't think I randomly attack people like that either. Again, if you think otherwise, bring it up with me. Put forth your criticism. In fact, I'll open a thread for anyone who wants to criticize me and discuss it.

<br />So you're basically saying that I shouldn't post or even privately tell you of things you're doing that bother me, but it's OK for you to post those things publicly attacking others and with nobody calling you on it?
<br />
<br />Initially I privately contacted you about issues I was having with your posts, and you brushed me off saying it was none of my business what you did on these forums. Nowhere am I calling you an idiot or incompetent, starting threads to put you down. I don't see a double standard I'm applying here. I may be missing it, so help me understand. I do see a double standard you're applying to me. You're saying that I have to put up with whatever you do here and not make a peep about it, while you can put people down who are <em>not even here to defend themselves</em>.
<br />
<br />You're annoyed with smwcenteral and smkdan? Say so. "I'm really angry at the people at smwcentral for their incorrect technical documents. I have wasted lots of time on them, only to discover they're incorrect and the cause of my programs not working. I don't understand why they haven't improved in skill after all these years of doing hacks. How could they still make such basic errors after all that time? It's also annoying the way they think that a particular graphic effect will make everything good, as if that eliminates all the problems with their code."  Of course, the best thing to do is contact these people directly and air your complaints, but that's not always possible if they aren't willing to talk about it.
<br />
<br />This is a community. In such things, people discuss problems they have with each other and try to work something out. I've tried several ways of resolving this with you. It's not hard to participate with others in resolving things in a way satisfcatory to all parties. Granted, most of us get trained to not solve problems well, but it's always possible to start learning. It's not a zero-sum situation if the goal is resolution. Nobody need be left angry or the loser.

<br />
<br />I don't know if this forum supports it though.  Ahhh.. the good old days of UDP (Usenet Death Penalty).
<br />
<br />But seriously, attacking others is counter-productive to our community.  When I get ready to fight over something I sometimes stop and ask myself, "Will this matter in 20 years from now?  Will I even remember it?"  If the answer is no, then just walk away.  Other times I forget, pick a fight, and then feel like an ass afterwards.
<br />
<br />Vigorous technical debate is good though.
<br />
<br />I should take my own advise and consider if I should submit this post or not.  Should I really inject my opinion here?  Probably not.  I hope to not upset anyone.

I don't even know what is that smwcentral thing is and I just saw some kind of flame war was started here, so I tried to put a touch of humor, and apprently fell flat on my face. I didn't know about tepples psychological issues, and never thought that blargg would consider it a personal attack.
<br />Both of you have contributed incredibly well to the NESDev scene, and this forum is usually a great place where people never flames others (but this thread seems to be an exception).
<br />I was just attempting to calm down psycopathicteen. Not only I didn't calm him, but I also angered the other protagonits  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> 
<br />
<br />So again I'm really sorry, and if you guys would stop fight too this would be amazing. And blargg is right there is no reason to make a thread to bash people that aren't even there (even if I know nothing about them or their stuff). I did exactly this once, and man I took my lesson. The guys signed up there and replicated - they literally smacked me hard. (this thread probably still exists but man I'd be the last to want to link to it). I really took my lesson this time and will never do it again.
<br />
<br />Now I took yet another lesson and know I shouldn't do anything when there is a flame between other members (except maybe ask for the topic to be locked like I did last time I remember there was one here).

<br />
<br />I'd love for this place to be for technical discussion. When there's something that's marring that, I contact the person and see whether it can be worked out. Keeping silent is stupid; how are problems going to be resolved if you just put up with them? That just leads to anger seeping out in every post, and worse problems. I think constructive fighting is something people should do more of, because without it they go around doing destructive things towards each other in every interaction, without ever improving things. I regret not having spoken up more in the past about things.

<br />Everyone has hatred against a bunch of things, but it's always a great idea to say off the subject as much as possible. Especially starting a thread about the subject is not a good idea.
<br />
<br />I could do thread about hatred I have against quite a few things, NES-dev or video game related or not (Metroid on NES, Action 52, crappy chinese famiclones and pirated games, the recent decay of the Final Fantasy series, macs, soccer, time that pass too fast/slow, girls that dresses like bitches, smokers, trains who are late, ...)
<br />Yet I'd just stay away of the subjects, and mention I'm opposed to /against something only if I have to.
<br />
<br />Okay I'm a big mouth but I clearly did not follow what I am saying...
<br />anyways let's all be friends again and talk technical &amp; everything will be fine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Incorrect technical documents? For aslong as I've known about Anomie's regs.txt that is what I've referred people to or cited (the entirety of my stay at SMWC).  You should always check multiple sources (romhacking.net is nice for this) and try different things yourself if something doesn't seem to be working out.  Or just ask about it.  Surely the beef with SMWC and myself can't be about something that simple?
<br />
<br />Regarding "double-standards", if you have recurring issues with multiple users from multiple communitues and believe that everyone else is the problem and you are perfectly fine, wouldn't make a whole lot more sense if the reverse situation was true? It sounds like a persecution-complex.  Not everyone on the internet is applying double-standards to you, they'd be responding the same way they would to everyone else.
<br />
<br />As for 'idiots', people have already stated that it's a huge community so you're going to have:
<br />-'stupid people' or beginners who are a little to eager to try and help others out <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />-'smart people'
<br />-people who lie somewhere in the middle.
<br />
<br />Normally one of the 'smart people' will step in and make corrections where necessary so what's the big deal here?
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">psycopathicteen wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Maybe if you'd stop escalating the problem and <strong>just let me win for once</strong> I'd be happy and I'd no-longer need to bottle up my hatred for smwcentral and smkdan.  Everybody has a double-standard for me.  What isn't allowed for me is perfectly accepteable when everybody else does it.</div>
<br />
<br />The bolded part is one of the big issues.  I think blargg has pointed it out once before, but there seems to be this recurring theme where you come to some conclusion already, post about it, and expect everyone to agree with you (a 'win' I suppose).  If someone presents something that contradicts your own post, you either dismiss it or things get pretty ugly.  blargg's post you quoted this in response to is a good example.  He put forward a decent set of points but you just dismiss it with a post that makes it clear you just want people to agree with you, contradicting posts have no significance to you or something.  How do you have a discussion with someone like this?
<br />
<br />As for myself: 
<br />-I try to be civil in discussions, however if someone disagrees and makes personal attacks when I post what I believe is a decent contribution to the discussion, my tone is going to change considerably after a few reminders about ad-hominem attacks.  I don't even need a full set of fingers to count how many times this is happened within years though =p
<br />-If I put forward my arguments in a way that bothers you, talk to me about it? I don't mean to belittle anyone.  If you <em>are</em> bothered by the way someone presents their arguments, responding with personal attacks is that absolute worst way to deal with it.  It doesn't resolve anything.  I've resolved issues I've had with others before just by PMing them and explaining what's up =|
<br />
<br />Also, I can't remember anything involving you within the last year involving SMWC or myself, so are you really bottling up anger over something that happened 30 months ago or whatever, and just want other people to validate your view on the situation to resolve it? Doesn't that seem a little bit odd? That's extremely unhealthy if that's the case and worth reconsidering.
