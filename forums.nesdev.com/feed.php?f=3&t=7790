There have to be 1. no continuous communication between the CIC, 2. enough video memory to make a picture, and 3. interrupt vectors pointed at RAM or the system's BIOS. Systems meeting this are disc-based consoles as well as the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS. You can even load up one town on Animal Crossing in your GameCube, take the disc out, put it in your Wii, and load up another town.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed May 25, 2011 6:38 pm</p><hr />

So the memory in the cart is part of the system, huh? I always thought that the memory in the cart was completely copied into the nes's memory and if the program needed to switch it would grab the code from the cart, so that's what I did with my emulator(this time, grabbing code from the rom file). Seems like that's not gonna work now <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />. Hmmm, I'll have to redesign my memory then.<br /><br />But now that I think of it, if that was true then I guess you could just pull the cart from the nes at anytime and not screw anything up(at least games with no mappers). Perhaps I was thinking along the lines of cd-based game where the game doesn't immediately screw up cause you took the CD out cause everything that the game currently needs is in ram.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4007">Undubbed</a> — Wed May 25, 2011 6:17 pm</p><hr />

Metroid actually has CHR data in pretty much every bank. They stuck it wherever they could fit it.<br /><br />To load the tile data the game has a table of "tile groups" that specify the ROM bank and address of the CHR data, the address it should be copied to in VRAM, and the number of bytes that make up the group of tiles. This is part of that table, from SnowBro's Metroid disassembly:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; Format:     Source Bank<br />              Source Address, dest address &#40;VRAM&#41;, size in bytes<br />GFXInfo:<br />LC6E0:   .byte $06         ;&#91;SPR&#93;Samus, items.      Entry 0.<br />LC6E1:   .word $8000, $0000, $09A0<br />LC6E7:   .byte $04         ;&#91;SPR&#93;Samus in ending.      Entry 1.<br />LC6E8:   .word $8D60, $0000, $0520<br />LC6EE:   .byte $01         ;&#91;BGR&#93;Partial font, &quot;The End&quot;.   Entry 2.<br />LC6EF:   .word $8D60, $1000, $0400<br />LC6F5:   .byte $06         ;&#91;BGR&#93;Brinstar rooms.      Entry 3.<br /></div><br />Each level (as well as the title screen/ending sequence) specifies a list of tile groups, by index, that are used. The game just looks up the location of the tile data and copies it to the PPU.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4871">snarfblam</a> — Wed May 25, 2011 1:24 pm</p><hr />

If a game doesn't have CHR-ROM, it uses CHR-RAM. The emulator doesn't have to load anything, the game code will take care of filling the CHR-RAM with the data the game will use, you just have to make that memory writable.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed May 25, 2011 8:47 am</p><hr />

Many different PPU accesses go out to the cart while rendering a frame. When the PPU reads pattern tables, it is just reading whatever it is given from whichever chip on the cart happens to respond to the read (or write for that matter). There is no memory for pattern tables in the NES console. <br /><br />When a game uses a RAM chip for graphics, it will have to write to the pattern tables to fill it with data. <br /><br />I hope what I have written helps (and is at least accurate on a basic level).<br /><br />EDIT: I should probably mention that this applies as well to PRG-ROM. One of the most common mistakes is to use memcpy or a loop to copy data from the ROM to "PRG-ROM" arrays when you should just keep track of pointers for each bank (the smallest banks used in commercial game mappers is 4KB/1KB PRG/CHR, IIRC).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3934">Hangin10</a> — Tue May 24, 2011 8:03 pm</p><hr />

Some games, even LOZ, store their CHR data at unfriendly offsets so the tiles don't just pop out when viewed as a CHR viewer expects the data to be drawn.  Games that don't have CHR-ROM store their graphics in the only other available place...PRG-ROM.  The initialization of said games includes a loop where the relevant (usually title-screen first) portions of the CHR data are copied from the PRG-ROM location to CHR-RAM.  <br /><br />Some games, I'm sure, compress the CHR data stored in PRG-ROM so you'd never be able to see it by direct observation.<br /><br />ROM files with mappers are no different than ROM files without...they're just larger.  Since the NES CPU can only "see" 32KB of PRG-ROM at a time, some of the PRG-ROM data in the file is going to have to be loaded by your emulator into memory so that it can be "made visible" to the NES CPU when the NES CPU instructs the game's mapper circuitry to bankswitch.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3705">cpow</a> — Tue May 24, 2011 7:11 pm</p><hr />
