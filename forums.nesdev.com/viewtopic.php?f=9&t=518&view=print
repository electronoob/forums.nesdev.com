<br />For those wanting a more present-day version of a NES+Famicom combination: this could be what you want.
<br />
<br />For those of us who're more technical: fantastic hilarity in the FAQ, all around.  Is this thing even for real?  *shakes head*  Borderlines another "NES copier scam", if you ask me...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Currently, as things seem so far, it is yet another Famiclone.  It is not the first to have a 72-pin cart slot or NES controller ports.  It remains to be seen if it is worth more than another Famiclone known as the Neofami, which can be had for around $25 on Ebay.  Personally, I don't see what the problem is with getting a refurbished toaster NES, or if you are really cheap, refurbish one yourself.  Famiclones tend to be crap for many reasons.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree with the other posters in this thread.  It's a cool case, and not the worst idea in the world, but unlikely to be accurate enough for most of us.  They apparently are doing their own PPU, and not using the "NES on a Chip" that the other famiclones are using, which could be a good thing.  However, I wouldn't hold my breath for it to be accurate enough to run some of the more difficult carts, or to display the colors properly.  Personally I'm hoping the FPGA-NES (Kevtendo) gets off the ground with regards to production.  KH is a long standing and well respected NES hacker, and I trust him to do the console correctly.  I won't pre-judge the Nexgen thing before it's even released, but I'm not expecting much out of it.

<br />There's one way to settle this: <ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Wait for Gen-NEX to come out. </li><li>Have somebody whip up a PPU test suite that's tougher than Battletoads (to emulate, not to play). </li><li>Have somebody with a rewritable cartridge buy a Gen-NEX and run the test suite. </li></ol>

I have an original front-loader that has no problems playing clean carts and has never had the pin connector replaced or bent back into shape... though I have used a bit of Stabilant 22 on my cart contacts, which probably helps keep things working.  Personally, I think that the problems with the front-loading NES are overrated.  I have a SNES that was not taken care of and it has significant trouble playing games, and I have SNES carts that were not taken care of and they have trouble running on a working SNES.  My point is that if people mistreat a NEX or any other cart based console, it will have the same problems that a mistreated NES have.<br /><br />Somebody at digitpress is already having trouble getting some of their carts to even run.  How much you wanna bet it is because the carts are not taken care of?  I bet that is the same reason many people have trouble with the front loading NES.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">teaguecl wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">They apparently are doing their own PPU, and not using the "NES on a Chip" that the other famiclones are using, which could be a good thing.<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Where did you hear that?  Doing a custom PPU would be expensive.  In their FAQ, they make vague responses to questions about using a NoaC, but they never definitively said that they were not using the imfamous NoaC.  If it is a highly accurate clone, I'll buy at least 2 <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  But more than likely, this is just another Famiclone... though this time with a slightly better shell.

<br />
<br />From the FAQ, which didn't seem vague to me.  I read this to mean they are developing their own PPU at least, and probably the 6502 as well.
<br />
<br />Q: Does it contain custom ICs, or is it based around the NOAC [NES-on-a-chip] that most "clone" consoles are based around?
<br />A: Our IC is a custom designed IC that is built on the NES algorithm. Every attention to detail has been spent on compatibility.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It still does sound vague to me though.  I'd think any ASIC could be described as 'custom designed', I guess the real question is "by who?".
<br />
<br />There's slightly more info here:
<br /><a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3143042" class="postlink">http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3143042</a>
<br />
<br />There are 'NOAC's that add another graphics mode and other features.  I have some of the docs and manuals for one, saved somewhere.  If that's what they're using (I have no idea), I'm guessing it couldn't be much better than a usual clone (which often seem to have the sound wrong, at least).

It's pretty clear though that as of now, it'll just be a NOAC clone with wireless support so they can get this thing to the shelves.
