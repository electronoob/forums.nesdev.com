I don't know why it is THAT value (I'd guess that the &quot;00h&quot; is actually &quot;open bus&quot;).<br /><br />On my PAL NES, the &quot;reset period&quot; lasts until 311 lines after reset (=until END of vblank), as said in the wiki article.<br /><br />On tepple's NTSC NES, that &quot;reset period&quot; lasts until around 261 lines after reset (=until END of vblank), that's different as in the wiki article; which says around 241 lines after reset (=until BEGIN of vblank).<br /><br />Looks as if the wiki article is wrong about NTSC reset timings. Or are there different NTSC PPUs with different timings?<br />Well, or maybe BOTH is correct: 2007h.READs (what I was testing) being unlocked 261 lines after reset, and things like 2006h.WRITEs (what the wiki ariticle talks about) being unlocked 241 lines after reset - though that'd be pretty odd.<br /><br />The test program that I was using can be found here: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=99773#p99773">viewtopic.php?p=99773#p99773</a><!-- l --> (pputest.zip). The first two lines show reset related timings (in &quot;loop cycle&quot; steps; the actual &quot;clock cycle&quot; values would be somewhat higher). First <span class="posthilit">line</span> is time from Reset till 2007h.READ unlocking, and second <span class="posthilit">line</span> is time from 2007h.READ unlocking till next vblank NMI.<br /><br />On my PAL NES (manufactured around 1991) with RP2A07A CPU/APU and RP2C07-0 PPU I am getting values <strong>0BB9 and 0029EA</strong> (=reset period is 311 lines long).<br />On tepple's NTSC NES, the values are <strong>0A7D and 002CBC</strong> (=reset period is 261 lines long, or maybe a little bit shorter).<br />According to the timings in the wiki article, the test results would be around <strong>09B0 and 003070</strong> (=reset period would be 241 lines long).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh, and the missing dot...<br />I've read this somewhere else aleady, but here's it again, confirmed by my test proggy: There is missing dot on PAL consoles. And on NTSC consoles it does actually miss only if BG layer is enabled (does NOT miss if BG and OBJ layers are both off) (haven't tested what happens when only OBJ layer is on).<br /><br />According to the <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Clock_rate">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Clock_rate</a><!-- m -->, the missing dot is located in the &quot;pre-render&quot; (aka &quot;post-blank&quot;) scanline. How was that confirmed, and is it really true? Asking because it'd be a BAD location. From my experiences, analog CRT TVs do need some time to &quot;settle&quot; on the HSYNC rate. For example, if you display a <span class="posthilit">vertical</span> <span class="posthilit">line</span>, and then add/remove one dot, then the <span class="posthilit">vertical</span> <span class="posthilit">line</span> will look somehow curved in next 10-15 scanlines.<br /><br />If the missing dot occurs right before the picture rendering period, then the topmost scanlines of the picture should look somehow distorted. Instead of a <span class="posthilit">vertical</span> <span class="posthilit">line</span> you would get the curved-<span class="posthilit">line</span> effect in each 2nd frame, and a normal <span class="posthilit">vertical</span> <span class="posthilit">line</span> in each other frame (which together may look like a flimmering bold <span class="posthilit">line</span>). Is there any such effect on NTSC NES consoles?<br />Of course, 224 lines NTSC TVs will clip the upper ~8 lines, so that would also &quot;hide&quot; dirt effects in that lines.<br /><br />For reference:<br />The NTSC <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> is having it's missing dot in the post-rendering <span class="posthilit">line</span> (which means no dirt).<br />The PAL <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> in interlace mode is having a long scanline located at end of vblank (which does actually produce that curvy-<span class="posthilit">line</span> dirt effect)).

Someone will explain you how exactly this works because I don't understand the technical details myself, but in practice, that missing dot is there to modify the dot crawl you get in NTSC. You can see the difference in Blargg's NTSC filter, present in Nestopia for example. Games that turn rendering on late (Battletoads is an example) don't have this dot skipped, so the dot crawl looks very different.

So the &quot;dot crawl&quot; is just jumping back-and-forth (which will be seen as flimmering, rather than actual crawling). Without the missing dot, there should be some visible crawl (where the dots are constantly wandering back) (or maybe vice-versa: constantly forth).<br /><br />On PAL it's different, there's an integer number of PAL color cycles (4.xxMHz) per EVERY frame. So there's no crawl, and even no flimmering. Which, I think doesn't actually look any good. The composite artifacts are &quot;perfectly&quot; visible on PAL. With a blurry back-and-forth effect (as on NTSC), the PAL picture might have looked much smoother.

Analog CRTs are probably more likely to produce that effects. Digital video grabbers might immediately adopt themselves to changed HSYNC timings - or maybe they do compute the average HBLANK time across several scanlines (to eliminate dirty signals) - then they would show the effect, too.<br /><br />As far as I understood, the current proof for the missing dot location is that it depends on BG/OBJ enable bits at vblank end. But then it might be also possible that the hardware toggles an even/odd frame flag in that place, and then waits till vblank start, and removes the dot in that place.<br /><br />Best way to see the missing dot location would be viewing it with a good oscilloscope. Best by strobing the 4016h.W signal (as trigger point) shortly before Vblank start, and, in another test, shortly before Vblank end. Somewhere at that locations one should see a slightly shorter scanline. Or if it's a very good oscilloscope, then one could simply use /NMI or VSYNC as trigger points and scroll the picture left/right towards the vblank start/end locations.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think Blargg was the one that tested this and figured out where the missing do is(n't), and he's usually correct about this stuff. It might not be possible to figure the exact cycle in software, but after aligning the PPU and CPU as much as possible and enabling rendering at different times you can have an idea of the latest this can be done that will still cause the dot to be skipped. Just by looking at the picture you can tell if it's being skipped or not.
