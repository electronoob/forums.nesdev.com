<br />
<br />Even though my commodore monitor can't sit still for the flash, you can clearly see one frame has a white square for one duck, then another frame has a seperate square for the other duck...
<br />
<br />(don't count on the vertical position of the squares as the CRT lost vertical hold..  but the H position will tell you all)
<br />
<br />I will be re-recording that with a TV that works well with the flashing and doesn't lose vertical hold..

<br />NTSC's vertical sync frequency is 59.94Hz, but your TV syncs to the video so what you said makes no sense.
<br />
<br />Saying "540p", which I assume to mean 480p, is no different than a regular TV running 240p is completely false and I can't think of what you're trying to say for the life of me.
<br />
<br />Again, your TV most certainly *does* do scaling and most likely scales video via processing.

<br />Correct, it is looking for black/white instead of figuring out the horiz/vert position of the cathode ray beam.  Guns that do that will usually (always?) have a video pass through cable.
<br />
<br />But the white/not detection circuit needs the TV cathode ray tube to strobe at the correct frequency.  Taking text from <a href="http://www.zero-soft.com/HW/USB_ZAPPER/" class="postlink">another site</a> there is a band pass filter with a corner frequency of 15KHz.  You have to change a resistor to change that filter to 31KHz for computer CRTs.  If it just was looking for light or no light, then turning the room lights on and off should work.  Just having it be white/black isn't good enough.  Someone may already have a test app with half black and half white so you can test that.

<br />I seem to remember that one of the Zapper games (Operation Wolf?) used raster timing to find which scanline the gun was aimed at, then scanned white squares across the screen to determine the X coordinate. I calculate that even a 4 ms delay would throw off the aim by 60 lines. Duck Hunt, on the other hand, just cycles whiteness across one target per frame.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />kyuusaku, 540p to my TV is "1080i", it doesn't know any different.  The manual states that 1080i is the native display rate to the TV..  Service manual states that when in 1080i, the TV will shut down the scaler and allow the input to control the sync directly.  Since 540p is electrically the same as 1080i, as is 240p to 480i, it will work the same.
<br />
<br />What I'm trying to say is, if it's anything OTHER than 1080i/540p, it's scaled, yes, and that's why the zapper would only register "some shoots", but not all (i do have a vid of that, WITH the zapper in camera too).

<br />
<br />Instead of going any further with this, I suggest you read up on the aging CRT HDTV's.  If this was an LCD or Plasma, you'd be right.  But this is a CRT HDTV, and it very well is a different animal in this aspect, and has a "native" mode to which the internal scaler shuts off.
<br />
<br />I have asked an HDTV forum to explain this better for me, because I don't know how to explain it very well.  WAIT until they respond.
<br />----------------------------------
<br />
<br />bunnyboy, i understand what your saying, but how is it people can do a trick like pointing at a light, and the zapper registering a hit?  (though that never worked for me, even with one duck on the screen).

You shouldn't argue what you can't articulate into communicative words. It doesn't matter what you call something, or mean by something, if it's not agreeable to everyone else. So quit making random dubious statements.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">evildragon wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Instead of going any further with this, I suggest you read up on the aging CRT HDTV's.

<br />I don't mind going further. You really don't know what you're talking about, CRT are not a different "animal". If your TV displays 1080i natively, it's a 1125 line display, PERIOD. The only way to have a full screen 525 line picture, which your TV clearly has, is to scale.

<br />
<br />I have seen it done with some fluorescent lights, which may flicker at the correct frequency.  Don't think it would happen with an incandescent.  Some games will also check for a sequence like black white black to make sure that isn't happening.  I don't think Duck Hunt does that tho.

<br />
<br />If you have a "universal" video processor, it can probably output however many lines you want. What you can't understand is that I never argued against this and there's no reason for you to keep referring back to your Lumagen Radiance because it's irrelevant. 
<br />
<br />You're even supporting my point again when you say the TV thinks 540p is 1080i. The bottom line is that video has no say in the matter whether the display decides to interlace the video, all it can do is coax TVs with suggestive signals but nothing is guaranteed and I suspect that any digital 1080i TV won't display 540p since it's not an ITU/EBU recommendation, it will assume it's just deviant 1080i.

<br />I don't think Duck Hunt does either.  I captured a slow vid with 2 ducks.
