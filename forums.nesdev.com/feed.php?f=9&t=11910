<a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=127486#p127486" class="postlink">I suggested adding 2 saturation bits</a> to the existing palette, which would unlock a lot of colors that are sorely needed in the NES's palette.<br /><br />&lt;TECHNICAL EXPLANATION ALERT!!&gt;<br />It'd require a modified PPU though; basically, the two unused bits of the color will select between 4 sets of x0/xD columns (which act as the high and low peak of the color carrier). One set is x0 and xD being the same (fully grayscale), two sets that are intermediates, and then one set with x0 and xD being as they canonically are (fully saturated).<br />&lt;END TECHNICAL EXPLANATION&gt;<br /><br />This'd give you an HSV model, which is similar to the flexibility of an RGB model, but with the added bonus of keeping compatibility with existing NES games (at least ones that use &quot;official&quot; colors), and they'd look the same as a real NES. The downside being you can't hook it up to an RGB monitor. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Fri Oct 10, 2014 11:03 pm</p><hr />

<content type="html" xml:base="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=11910&amp;p=134854#p134854"><![CDATA[
<s>I was thinking about how those NES RGB add-on boards were described to work in <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=9561&amp;hilit=nesrgb&amp;start=45#p106055" class="postlink">this post</a> and I started thinking... If the selection between sprite palettes and background palettes is is done by feeding the PPU only black and white and reading those colors back from the composite signal, shouldn&#39;t it be possible to use a couple more colors &#40;without compromising the accuracy of the detection&#41; and double the amount of palettes games can use at any given time?<br /><br />Mirrors of $3F00-$3F1F could be used for the extra palettes. The only problem is that this would break existing games that use these mirrors, but maybe this could be something you could turn on and off.<br /><br />I know that something like this will hardly come to life, since nobody would want to develop games exclusively for modded consoles, so this feature would be used exclusively for enhancements at best, but I can&#39;t help considering the kinds of improvements that could be done to the video capabilities of the NES without replacing the PPU altogether, even though this is much more invasive than something that could be put in a mapper.</s><br /><br />EDIT: Another obvious enhancement is this area would be to use all 8 bits of the color values, allowing for a total of 256 colors to pick from, instead of the usual 54ish. Sure, this too would break compatibility with old games, so it would be ideal if these features could be enabled by the software.<br /><br />EDIT 2: Please ignore the striked out text, it was just me not thinking clearly. I also want to say that I don't think these kinds of hardware modifications are necessary at all, the NES is the NES and I love it that way, but some times it's fun to consider the possibilities.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Oct 10, 2014 3:21 pm</p><hr />
