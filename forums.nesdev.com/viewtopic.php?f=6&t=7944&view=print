		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello everyone. I have two questions that are somewhat related to NES music, and I was looking for advice from any musicians that frequent the boards.
<br />
<br />Recently I wanted to improve my composition skills (for writing music for my game projects) by learning more about harmonizing melodies and maybe a little about voice leading. Background wise, I'm somewhat familiar with the basics of harmony (chords, cadences, modulation, etc.) and I know a good bit about other aspects of music theory. So, I decided to take a look a two books I came across. The first one was "Harmonic Practice in Tonal Music" First Edition by Robert Gauldin, and while it provided quite a bit of information I found interesting, the whole thing seems to really just teach four-part writing in the end. I assumed then that I should learn four-part writing, and downloaded a copy of "Harmony: It's Theory and Practice" by Ebenezer Prout. Well, after I got through the first four chapters, accumulated a little over a dozen pages of notes about the rules of four-part writing, spent a total of three and half hours working on exercises that produced a whopping twelve measures, I began to question my need to learn four-part writing. It seems that it might not even be possible to self-teach such a subject without a machine (I mean teacher) to ensure that you don't break any rules. So, my questions to the musicians here are:
<br />
<br />Can you recommend any good books that teach how to harmonize melodies and a little about voice leading without the horrifying straitjacket of four-part writing?
<br />
<br />Do you think four-part writing would be something that would be beneficial in a practical sense to someone writing music for the NES? (Yes, I know the NES normally only has three voices, but the rules for the most part could still be applied.)
<br />
<br />Thank you for your time, and I'm very sorry for the ranting. Hopefully this isn't too off topic from what is intended to be posted here.

<br />(You could always use the FDS channel for one more part if you're only releasing NSFs.)
<br />
<br />I haven't composed any music for a long while (hell I should do that again how I'll forget how to do it) but I'm one of those guys for who less voices is a good thing. I've never managed to compose for many voices personally, but for some other people, it might be the other way around where the more voice there is the better.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I suppose, but I wanted to learn more about general tendencies and a set of general, practical guidelines. Four-part writing seems to be more like a learning how to solve musical crossword puzzles than a practical set of guidelines. You sit down with your puzzle, solve it according to a theorist's guidelines, listen to it, and by virtue of the many, many rules, it doesn't sound bad. I honestly can't imagine any one composing in the way four-part harmony puzzles are solved.

<br />Unless you're trying for fully algorithmic composition. You have a computer spit out a melody according to a small set of rules, and then you implement the "crossword puzzle" harmony rules on a computer.

<br />It's not off-topic by any means, but in all honesty you'll probably get more and better answers from a chiptune related forum, such as chipmusic.org.
<br />
<br />When it comes to composing, I'm more of a "feel" person, although I don't consider myself much of a musician. I like to learn by breaking down other peoples' songs (finding out melodies, chord progressions, rhythm patterns, etc) and analyzing them, hoping that I'll be able to absorb a thing or two in my musical toolbox to use "unconsciously" later.

Of course, this is bearing in mind that four-part writing rules are meant for creating independent voices (lines) that move together through a harmonic progression with a smooth sound. Honestly though, for anyone who is not writing for a choir, I think being aware of the primary rules are enough. I also think people wanting to learn more about harmonizing melodies should invest more time in developing good aural skills then applying algorithms.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I like to learn by breaking down other peoples' songs (finding out melodies, chord progressions, rhythm patterns, etc) and analyzing them, hoping that I'll be able to absorb a thing or two in my musical toolbox to use "unconsciously" later.</div>
<br />
<br />From what I gather, this seems to be the best way to learn about music. Awareness of theory helps, but text books can only go so far.
<br />
<br />Edit: If anything, this thread helped me put things in perspective. Thanks guys.

<br />That program looks amazing.
<br />The only bad thing is that I Googled the product name to see if anyone was discussing it, and got mostly W***z links.  Damn pirates.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't have the most advanced understanding of music theory, but having taken a couple courses and having some experience with 4-part writing, my advise would be to pay more attention to the 'rules' and suggestions regarding chord progressions. 
<br />
<br />A sure way to make sure your song "works" is to give it a solid chord progression. If you break rules of 4 part writing, like including parallel 5ths, etc, but you do it all within a framework of logical progressions (I IV V I, I ii V, etc), you should still have yourself some competent music. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> And then you can let your ear worry about the rest and not overly concern yourself with the myriad rules that come with 4-part writing.
<br />
<br />I think this particularly applies to the NES, because you often have to imply chords or kind of side-step how they work in the traditional sense. So my personal suggestion would be to pay closer attention to chord progressions and perhaps 2-voice counterpoint.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks bucky, that seems like sound advice. The one cool thing about the older text that I have is that it has a section in the back that covers three part writing, and a lot of that can be applied to voicing chords for the NES.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So my personal suggestion would be to pay closer attention to chord progressions and perhaps 2-voice counterpoint.</div>
<br />
<br />I've actually played around with 2-voice counterpoint (more as a fun diversion than anything) and I saw some of the more important rules crop up in the texts I have on four part writing. I kinda began to think of four part writing as a sorta 4-voice counterpoint.
<br />
<br />In any event, thank you very much for your advice.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Do you play keyboards at all? I've been playing piano for a number of years now (about 11), and most of that time improvising. It's a whole secondary hobby to video games/nes dev. Anyway, it might be the best way to learn voice leading cause you focus on the sound of your music rather than pedantic rules.
<br />
<br />I strove for years to understand the reasons "why" behind voice leading and all those rules, and I believe I understand them pretty well. The ridiculously simple truth behind common practice era harmony is that composers/musicians back then were really fascinated with the sound of thirds and their inversions (so major and minor thirds, major and minor sixths, tenths, etc.). They felt they sounded "sweetest" of all the intervals. Use of dissonances and parallels are treated with care to bring out the sweetness of thirds (and as a consequence, the fullness of triads) as much as possible.  That, for me, is the root cause of all those rules. I am not sure I understand why that isn't mentioned in music theory books, because once you realize it it becomes quite clear. 
<br />
<br />Video game music from what I've heard follows those rules rather loosely. You'll hear lots of parallel fifths for example. There are really no rules in music. If your premise is: "I'm an enlightenment gentleman and I believe in absolute truth even in music and I want to empahsize the sweetness of thirds at all costs!" then yes, follow those rules. If not, you can do anything you want.
<br />
<br />*edit* not to mention, video game music especially in the 8 bit era almost formed an entire language all its own, which probably violates all the traditional rules all over the place. One thing music theory books fail at miserably is treatment of rhythm. Video game music  in many cases has really creative use of rhythm, more influenced by jazz or rock music than it is by classical.

<br />
<br />Seems to be about correct. Rules seem to be genre specific, and even then they seem to not always be written in stone. I really just wanted to learn more about harmonic tendencies in different genres of music and how I could use that information to harmonize melodies. I had thought the harmony books I have would help with that, but I seem to be getting more mileage out of studying the works of others.
