Here's an update! <br /><br />So I bought a standard white/red Famicom with no mods over on Famicom World. I initially couldn't get it to work, but I had a second CRT lying around and was able to boot it up using channel 95. This Famicom worked perfectly with my original FDS RAM adapter. I haven't tried out the other one that Koitsu sent me, but after playing 30 minutes or so of SMB2 with no graphical errors whatsoever, I think I feel comfortable in ruling this as an issue with my modded FC.<br /><br />...which is a shame, because the picture quality from that machine is much better and I greatly prefer the TV setup I have in that room. But that's entirely my own problem.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> <br /><br />There may be one more chapter to this story, as I was able to pick up a junker FDS with a working RAM adapter, so once that comes in I'll give it another test with my modded FC and see what happens.<br /><br />UPDATE: Third time's the charm - that RAM adapter works with my modded FC, so I didn't have to make any drastic changes to my setup.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6498">Zycrow</a> — Sat Jun 21, 2014 12:13 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, my Famicom is modified to use component cables - it's one of the mods that appears professional (there are cable ports on the side of the system rather than sticking out of the controller wiring, for example). I've historically had a very difficult time getting Famicoms to work with an RF switch, and I vastly prefer the original Famicom design, which was why I went for the modified one rather than the official AV model. <br /><br />Possibly at some point I'll buy a second Famicom, but given that I've bought a Famicom, a disk system, and a lot of games over the past several months, I may wait a bit before deciding my next move. <br /><br />Meanwhile, let me know if you guys want me to try anything more within the next couple days before I send Koitsu's hardware back to him.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6498">Zycrow</a> — Thu May 29, 2014 5:53 pm</p><hr />

The fact there's now two suspect FDS RAM adapters involved (one of which worked fine on my own setup here) seems to imply the issue may in fact be with the Famicom, possibly the cartridge/edge connector not making full/good contact with all FDS RAM adapters.<br /><br />I can't confirm or deny that the FDS RAM adapter we call &quot;C&quot; works, because my FDS setup is with you.  :-)<br /><br />So if there was something to try replacing, I would suggest starting with a Famicom.  I know your Famicom is modded or something to work on your setup (video-related?  Maybe RGB mod?  Or component mod?), but it's starting to sound to me like you just have a crappy cartridge slot on your Famicom that works &quot;mostly well&quot; with carts but possibly used FDS RAM adapters have a slightly different edge connector thickness or something and it's just enough to make your Famicom wig out.  I've seen this myself on my old (now-given-away) original Famicom whose cartridge connector was quite worn -- slightly touching a cart would result in graphical garbling.  It's the best guess I have at this point, and it's all speculative on my part.<br /><br />This is partially why I wish I had sent you my Famicom AV as well, but to ship all that in one box would have been quite a lot (more than I already paid).  Otherwise I do not have a spare Famicom or Famicom AV to send you.  :(<br /><br />I also don't mod anything I own (nor do I buy modded stuff) solely because I don't trust the modifications.  For all I know one of those bazillion mods causes some kind of weird voltage or electrical problem that manifests itself in rare edge cases.  I'm not an EE guy so again all this is speculative.  This is one of those things where someone familiar with all that needs to be present physically in person to actually troubleshoot what is going on, otherwise all we're gonna end up doing is just spending money on products + shipping until &quot;we find a combo that works&quot; (when aside from clone incompatibility, all this stuff should &quot;just work&quot;).<br /><br />EDIT: I should note *prior* to sending you FDS RAM adapter &quot;C&quot;, I cleaned the edge connectors using the same methodology I've cleaned all my NES and Famicom cartridges with (glass top cleaner followed by post-clean-up using ~80% isopropyl alcohol).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Thu May 29, 2014 5:31 pm</p><hr />

OK! It's time for a new chapter in Zycrow's Weird FDS Problems. <br /><br />Today I received in the mail another package from the endlessly generous Koitsu, and this time it was a third RAM adapter (we will call it subject &quot;C&quot;). <br /><br />The bad news is that subject C did not solve our problems. In fact, to make things even stranger, subject C is actually less reliable than my original adapter (we'll call it subject A). <br /><br />So far, I've tried all of my games with subject C and my own FDS. I may try some other combinations before I ship all of Koitsu's stuff back to him. The results:<br /><br />Super Mario Bros. 2: Game freezes on the title screen; sometimes the screen is blank or completely glitched out. Mario's sprite is garbled like with subject A, but not quite as much. <br />Moero Twin Bee: Garbling on the sprites during the intro sequence; game freezes afterward. <br />Doki Doki Panic: Game freezes immediately. <br />Metroid: Game freezes after title screen. <br />Palutena no Kagami (my copy): This was the only game that actually loaded all the way. Pit's sprite was garbled, but not as badly as on subject A, and there was some other graphical glitchiness here and there. <br /><br />I have not tried out Koitsu's copy of Palutena no Kagami yet. <br /><br />So, wow! What a weird situation. I think what I'm gonna have to do is just hunt down RAM adapters until I get one that works.<br /><br />EDIT: I should note that before and during my testing, I did several rounds of cleaning on subject C's connectors, as well as my Famicom's connectors, just for good measure. This appeared to have a small effect on SMB2, though I was never able to get past the title screen there.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6498">Zycrow</a> — Thu May 29, 2014 5:16 pm</p><hr />

Have you tried holding START and SELECT on controller I while powering on with the RAM adapter to start the RAM test?

(See, EE isn't my thing... heh <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> )<br />For an unrelated yet equally bizarre-as-hell issue with someone's FDS RAM adapter, <a href="http://www.famicomworld.com/forum/index.php?topic=8353.0" class="postlink">check out this thread</a> at Famicomworld.  It starts getting interesting (and into specific models of chips in the FDS RAM adapter that are glitchy/buggy in some way?) at the 2nd page.  Ignore the crap on page 3 onward -- just adolescents fighting over nonsense -- although there is an interesting tidbit on page 5 (talking about FDS RAM adapters with two different kinds of CHR RAM chips I think).<br /></div><br />I remember that thread. It was a heated discussion and it looks like some of the posts have been deleted since then. Anyway that incident is what made people to start suspecting CHR RAM chips to be faulty and is why I thought this was something similar. It has been researched in this thread <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.famicomworld.com/forum/index.php?topic=8512.0">http://www.famicomworld.com/forum/index ... pic=8512.0</a><!-- m --> but in the end no concrete results have yet to appear.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6013">Pokun</a> — Tue May 20, 2014 4:52 pm</p><hr />
