		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For well over a year, I have been asked to add pitch bends to my music engine Pently. How are pitch bends typically notated in a musical score?<br /><br />As a child, I took piano lessons and played trumpet in the school concert band. The piano is a discrete-pitch instrument. So are most instruments in a concert band, which use keys or valves to select a pitch. Only a fretless instrument is capable of a continuous pitch slide from one note to another. These include voice, fretless string instruments, and slide wind instruments such as the trombone or slide whistle. I really wasn't exposed to a lot of music heavily exploiting this while growing up, other than as a variant realization of grace notes. So the music theory that grew in my head over these years didn't have much to say about pitch bends.<br /><br />A pitch can be represented in one of three ways:<br /><br /><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>Period: Time between repeats of the waveform </li><li>Frequency: Repeats of the waveform per unit time, reciprocal of pitch </li><li>Log frequency: Logarithm of the ratio between the frequency of the waveform and that of the first note of the scale. This most closely matches human perception of pitch. </li></ol><br />Most of classical music theory is based on relationships in the log frequency domain. Equal temperament measures intervals in &quot;semitones&quot;, a logarithm to the base twelfth root of two. For example, an octave (2:1 frequency ratio) is 12 semitones, and a perfect fifth (3:2 frequency ratio) is 7 semitones.<br /><br />But synthesizers don't directly use log frequency. Instead, they use either period or frequency. Like string instruments, classic square wave based synths (e.g. AY-3-8910, SN76489, Atari TIA, 2A03, VRC6, and Game Boy PSG) use period, as do some samplers (Amiga and Nintendo DS). FM chips (e.g. YM2612) and other samplers (e.g. Sony S-DSP) use frequency instead, sometimes with a power-of-2 prescaler to set the octave.<br /><br />Because my experience before designing Pently was for discrete-pitch instruments, I designed Pently to use discrete pitch. But later, I ran into issues with video game music composers who rejected Pently for not having the portamento and vibrato effects. I figured out a way to make vibrato whose depth in log frequency is the same at any pitch, using an algorithm that would be easy to adapt to either a period synth or a frequency synth and with the oscillation frequency fixed at 4 to 5 Hz, which I found most typical in instrumental music.<br /><br />But portamento is a different beast entirely, as it involves two different pitches. Try to slide the period linearly, as most Amiga-style trackers do, and it'll sound faster at high pitches because there each period step is larger in log-frequency space. Try to slide the frequency linearly, and it'll sound faster at low pitches because there each frequency step is larger in log-frequency space. Sliding the log frequency is difficult on an 8-bit processor, as many music engines operate using a lookup table from log frequency to period or frequency, with one entry per semitone. For a pitch bend of less than an octave, a linear period or frequency slide is unlikely to matter. But the composer who requested this feature has a habit of using bends that are both very slow (a semitone over the course of a quarter note) and very fast (multiple octaves in a sixteenth note), and a multi-octave bend sounds noticeably different when done as period, frequency, or log frequency.<br /><br />So I was hoping to look for inspiration from musical notation for strings, trombone, or voice to see how they approach pitch bend.<br /><br />If you fail to understand anything in this question, let me know the first thing you failed to understand, and I will try to explain further or draw and attach an illustration.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There isn't really a standard notation. The glissando as a wiggly line like in the article lidnariq linked is well known enough-- have seen it in lots of trombone parts in classical scores. It's a bit ambiguous though, since it originally comes from harp or keyboards where you're dragging your hand along the strings/keys producing a series of discrete notes. (Kind of a holdover from the 19th century.)<br /><br />Some really pedantic ones put the word mark &quot;gliss.&quot; over the squiggly line (or even just over a phrase ligature). Some use very atrocious notation like a series of small chromatic notes despite it being a continuous slide. I don't recommend that. I'd also ignore the funny marks you see in that &quot;slide&quot; article that was linked. They're quite archaic and not well known unless you study Baroque music (17-18th century), which that article is narrowly about despite its generic seeming title.<br /><br /><br />On many modern scores I've seen just a straight line instead of the squiggly line, which looks nicer and cleaner, IMO. Usually it applies to scores for instruments with an inherent slide, like trombone, slide guitar, etc.<br /><br />I'd generally recommend just doing that (straight line) if it's an instrument where slides are common, but if it's an instrument where they're less common or you think it's ambiguous you might put a clarifying mark like &quot;(slide)&quot; over the first one in the piece?<br /><br /><br />The definitive guide to music notation is this book by Gardner Read: <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Music-Notation-Manual-Modern-Practice/dp/0800854535" class="postlink">Music Notation: A Manual of Modern Practice</a><br /><br />If you have interest in the topic I'd highly recommend that book. It's very well written, and is a very comprehensive survey of good ideas for musical notation.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />One more note about precision. Gliss marks are not normally used in a precise way. If the notation seems a bit &quot;loose&quot; it's because most of the time the application of the slide is left for the human performer to interpret.<br /><br />While a precise slide should have a start and end note that the slide goes between, there are lots of occasions where a precise starting pitch or timing isn't needed (e.g. pitch bend into a note). For a precise starting pitch but imprecise timing, you can use a small note (&quot;grace&quot; note) to start the slide, like in the example I gave above. If a start or end pitch doesn't need to be specified, the gliss mark might terminate at a vague location. (Often trombone &quot;fall&quot; marks are sort of a curve line with a rough or tapered end to indicate the vagueness of its end.)<br /><br />Precise timing is more difficult to express, i.e. if there are two notes with a gliss between, when does the gliss start and stop? In a lot of cases precision is not expected, but where it is, I've seen a convention that the gliss should last the entire length of the note preceding the gliss mark (starting immediately at the start of that note) and finish on the note following it. If you want to end on a pitch but also end the tone at the same time, you could place a small note before a rest, and gliss to that. If you need a held pitch before starting the gliss, make two notes and tie them, then start the gliss from a second one (i.e. holds for the duration of first note, then begins gliss from second one) that goes to a third note where the gliss ends.<br /><br />Imprecise pitch effects get used a lot in Jazz, see <a href="http://www.timusic.net/debreved/jazz-notation/" class="postlink">this article</a> under &quot;Effect Articulations&quot; for some examples, though there is a bit of variety between various pulishers here. The examples in the article are fairly common and understood, but there's alternative ways to do everything. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />(I keep saying &quot;small note&quot; instead of &quot;grace note&quot; because there's some for whom it means a very specific thing.)<br /><br />(Also, sorry for 3 posts. I'm a trombone player with a degree in music, so it's kind of in my sphere of interest.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There is several approaches :<br /><br />1) Do not handle the logarithmic aspect at all. Just compute the pitch value written to hw registers, and interpolate from those and/or just add constant values to those modifying pitch/period directly. Many early sound engine does this, for instance in Battletoads &amp; Double Dragon at the end of Level 3 you can observe a sound effect which is a pitch sliding down for a long period of time, it goes lower and lower at a slower and slower pace, simply because some constant is being added to the square waves pitch. Also all Squaresoft SNES SPC sounds functions like that. I do not know other engines because I haven't reverse engineered them, but I suspect many works like that.<br /><br />2) Use a pitch system internally with a precision lower than a note. For instance, a precision of 32 points per semitone is nice to have, allowing to have 384 points per octave. Have a period table of those 384 points, and shift the values left and right to reach other octaves. My sound engines works like that, but also the one of Just Breed on the NES, which I reverse engineered its sound engine.<br /><br />One big problem with this solution when applied to the NES platform is that vibratos of small amplitude becomes problematic at higher pitches (i.e. lower periods), as the hw period register is less precise than the 32 point per semitones used internally, leading to a weird effect I cannot describe in english. Actually this is a problem with all solutions anyway, but it's particularly notable here.<br /><br />3) Same a 2, but use a regular pitch table having only points for notes, i.e. a normal pitch table. Use linear interpolation between two notes, then the pitch slide becomes linear on a global scope, but logarithmic between two adjacent notes. I doubt anyone would notice the difference. The note table can be either one octave or all octaves - it doesn't matter at this point. I do not know of any sound engine using this technique, but I'll probably use it whenever I'll ever write any new sound enigne, as it allows saving ROM for a pitch table of 384 semitoes, and the loss of precision is negligible.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">As a child, I took piano lessons and played trumpet in the school concert band.

If there isn't one then it can be made up; in order to do so, figure out what is Italian words for pitch bend (I guess &quot;portamento&quot; is probably the closest word, which is known in English as well specifically for this purpose) and then that is the notation. Perhaps combine it with the glissando notation; and then the words specify that it is a continuous pitch slide. (I don't expect it help much with designing Pently, but it can help if you want to notate it I suppose. Figuring out best way to make the bend seem more difficult.)
