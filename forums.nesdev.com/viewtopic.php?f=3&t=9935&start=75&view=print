One thing that helps is the use of vector tools such as Flash and then rasterizing the result.

Added a button for optimizing the number of screen shots by removing redundant ones.<br />5. CHR RAM games will now use the tile pattern in addition with the colour palette when comparing. So now we can make graphics for CHR RAM games which modifies the tile patterns.

For example in 1943, the tiles on the right side of a ship use the same pattern as the left but flipped over. Another example is in Final Fantasy 3 where it shifts the pattern to make the water in the background appears to be flowing. Hope this answers your question.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is a great project. I hope that artists become interested in creating HD remakes, like Marcelo Barbosa has done for Alex Kidd in Miracle World using HiSMS.<br /><br />  The sprite sheets for Super Mario Bros are fairly simple, so it's not an overwhelming project for an artist. Kung Fu and other early NES releases are the same way. And the characters of NES games tend to have very simple animation in general.<br /><br />   I'd love to take a closer look, but I can't get either HDNes or HiSMS working on my Mac using Wine. I believe that HiSMS doesn't work because it uses Direct3D 7 (rather than 8 or so). Not sure about HDNes.<br /><br />   Perhaps you could post a ZIP of graphics from an NES game, as ripped by HDNes, along with any remade graphics you've done?<br /><br />   I can see artists trying graphic packs for Super Mario Bros resembling New Super Mario Bros, Paper Mario or an animated style.<br /><br />   There is a lot of potential for 8-bit remakes.
