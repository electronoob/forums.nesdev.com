		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Apparently this is the hottest new youtuber gimmick game since youtube won't stop recommending &quot;&quot;funny&quot;&quot; videos about it. <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/240720/Getting_Over_It_with_Bennett_Foddy/" class="postlink">&quot;Getting over it with Bennett Foddy&quot;</a> is the name of it, and it makes me wonder if our friend tepples inspired or is part of it. If I remember correctly he was toying with similar concepts for his trademark round bottom characters in which the player had to use a Bionic Commando like grapple gun to navigate the level.<br /><br />Tepples, did you have a hand in this? If not you might want to check it out to see if you can employ something like that for a future game of yours. The character design is somewhat similar to the ones you have.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.foddy.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/thumb.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOHHsUAyGVU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOHHsUAyGVU</a><!-- m -->

I think it's actually my favourite game of the year.<br /><br />I'd recommend not watching that speedrun video as your introduction to it, though. It shows you the whole game and a way to solve it (which will take practice, but a lot of the fun is experimenting and learning). Instead maybe a let's play with all the frustration of failing would give a much better and less spoilery introduction to what it is.<br /><br />(Seems to be tricky to find a LPer of this who isn't constantly annoyingly screaming at it, though, or I'd link one myself.)<br /><br />This one seems okay:<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VewagdAZjFA" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VewagdAZjFA</a>

He described as Getting over it with... is a game &quot;about Sexy Hiking&quot; and also that the pot was there to protect the character's legs. The mode of movement in SH is also by grabbing onto things with a hammer in a similar way, but with no pot over the character's legs. So it seems like it's probably just a happy coincidence.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUV5R68jg2c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUV5R68jg2c</a><!-- m -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've never played <em>Sexy Hiking</em> or <em>Getting Over It</em>, and when I wanted to import <em>Umihara Kawase</em> for Super Famicom, I discovered unfortunately that it was priced as a collector's item. The closest thing I have is a copy of <em>Bionic Commando</em> for NES. I did briefly play <a href="http://www.nagnazul.com/yhnl.html" class="postlink">a similar Flash game titled <em>You Have No Legs</em></a> years ago, but unfortunately, I can no longer play it because its developer Martin Brochu appears not to have ported it to HTML5.

So it seems like it's probably just a happy coincidence.</div><br />I am also a <em>huge</em> fan of the Umihara Kawase series, especially the third game Sayonara Umihara Kawase. They do have a slightly similar kind of climbing mechanic to Getting Over It, and an unrelenting but very fair and deep difficulty. It also has a similar aesthetic of levels made out of piles of mundane objects.<br /><br />They also don't have pretentious philosophical ramblings or stupid jump scares or things otherwise clearly designed to demoralize you. (I like some of Foddy's commentary a lot, but it has diminishing value for me. It's at least better than The Witness' stupid motivational quotes which I thought were totally pointless.) Oh also it has some great music, and it's a much longer game.<br /><br />All three were eventually ported to Windows and are currently available on Steam:<br /><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/sub/85452/" class="postlink">http://store.steampowered.com/sub/85452/</a><br /><br /><br />Sexy Hiking is still available on its author's website for free (Windows):<br /><a href="http://www.jazzuo.wz.cz/games/sexyhands/sexy_hiking/sexyhiking.htm" class="postlink">http://www.jazzuo.wz.cz/games/sexyhands/sexy_hiking/sexyhiking.htm</a><br /><br />You can walk in Sexy Hiking though it's not really that useful for getting around its levels for the most part. The physics are very dodgy. I managed to complete the first level but I was very uninterested in continuing past there. The hammer climbing concept is neat but it's implemented so roughly, I can see why it was inspiring to Foddy, both by the fascinating climbing mechanic but also just by how badly it played probably made him want to do a &quot;good&quot; version of it. Getting Over It has really very well refined design IMO, a lot of the challenges were just perfectly on that edge of fair but hard to master. Sexy Hiking does not.<br /><br />There's another version of Sexy Hiking on another website with very slightly different levels (or at least the first tree was a little harder, didn't go looking much past the first level).<br /><br /><br />As for the pot, it is a very functional part of gameplay. Gives a reason that you can't just walk along, of course, but also gives a sense of weight and friction (can't sit down on too much of a slant or you'll slide) and makes a nice round object to have to navigate collisions with. I think it's also slightly a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes" class="postlink">Diogenes</a>' tub?
