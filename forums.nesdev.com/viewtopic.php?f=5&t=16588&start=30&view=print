Two bosses, a still unfound trick, and like 200 animation frames. It's short, but it's <em>packed</em> with content. At least give it a picture! <a href="https://kasumi.itch.io/indivisible" class="postlink">And a link.</a><br /><br />Edit: And ROM City Rampage should get some pictures too. It's actually pretty beautiful, even if there's not much to do. There's instructions for ripping it if you own Retro City Rampage in various places. Here's some gifs<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3g6uzVj.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xDYGeaZ.gif" alt="Image" /><br />Edit2: LJ65 by Tepples is super good, even if it's no longer distributed by him. I might be biased just because it's got Tetris Grand Master Series gameplay. <br /><br />Blade Buster!<br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lFVRsSA.gif" alt="Image" /><br />Hmm. I might just make a second post, there's a lot of good stuff around.

As a blog post it gets out of hand really easily. I'm glad to see it mostly populated with genuinely interesting looking games, though. There is a lot of pointless fluff in the homebrew scene that easily ends up flooding lists like this if you have a truly completionist approach to it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Kasumi wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I might be biased just because it's got Tetris Grand Master Series gameplay. </div><br />Not a bias. TGM is objectively incredible.

The images you posted are nice, but they don't look better than the amazing NES graphics you posted before. It's probably because of the wide pixels of the C64...
