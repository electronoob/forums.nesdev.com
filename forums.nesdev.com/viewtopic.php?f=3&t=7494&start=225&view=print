You have to find a specialty tool somewhere to get access to that info with iNES.</div>
<br />Instead of using your specialty tool, HashCalc (Yes, HashCalc is a specialty tool aswell), why not <a href="http://wkter.com/iNESHashCalc.rar" class="postlink">use my specialty tool</a> that I just wrote and drag ONE iNES file onto it, then paste your hashes into notepad or your favorite text editing specialty tool. Hell, it even saves you the trouble of generating 3 hashes manually!
<br />
<br />Example output of Adventure Island 2:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">PRG - E021CEDF0B7700B3EEE7E5B76B2E23000075E06F4D7C13A4B556452952D3AEC0 <br />CHR - 7F28B46897CA425F840776805E79902E246C450B5A21939E7DF78B2300C8C81B <br />Combined - 7A675D4C03C7E0CB336083AA1184B43790B015C18A7C38153F16D47DBE4F4634 </div>
<br />
<br />Seems a lot simpler than opening a ZIP, drag and drop 2 files into a specialty tool, then take the two hash strings into the specialty tool again, and finally copy your final hash string, doesn't it?
<br />
<br />You see, your arguments that the need of "specialty tools" for iNES somehow makes your format better is simply invalid, and I just demonstrated it. This also demonstrates that dumpers will not necessarily be happier with your format, as I can just as easily write a iNES file combiner/separator as well. And we're only talking about simple drag and drop programs here...
<br />
<br />And keep in mind, I'm still just a beginner in C/C++.

Someone 10 years from now who was not involved in any of this would not know where to get it. It's also extra and unnecessary work to add support for custom containers in database programs when ZIP, something they already support, would work perfectly fine for these files.

<br />
<br />Are you an author? It depends on what you want. If you want a mapping guarantee for users and yourself, you distribute as many boards as you can with the emulator along with all the other hardware. If you want to make it easier on dumpers and authors of archiving tools, you don't cling to custom containers unless there's some sort of unique benefit to doing it. My spending years to create an emulator instead of archiving games isn't going to change your mind if you don't care about that.

<br />.... You're just being unbelievably stubborn and willfully ignorant...
<br />You completely dismiss any sort of argument with some ad-hoc rationalization without justification.
<br />Are you familiar with John Romero's advertising campings? Your format reminds me of Daikatana, and your way of promoting it reminds me of his advertising campaigns.
<br />
<br />I'm not saying this to be mean, but you just don't consider other opinions at all. Why don't you?

<br />
<br />Why do you still seem so concerned with the matter? Didn't you say you were done with the thread? ZIP is a standard if there ever was one and you get your mappings from people who distribute bad roms. Take the blue bill and stop trolling.
