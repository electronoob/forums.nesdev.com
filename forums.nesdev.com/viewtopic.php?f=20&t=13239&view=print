I couple of requirements is that it needs to be from the 80s to the mid 2000s and needs to be cartridge based. I would prefer if the screen was in color because those tend to be less blurred. I would also prefer if it wasn't too expensive. Also there has to be a good flash cart I can have shipped to America available online for a reasonable price.

Converting the 6502 to GBZ80 manually will take you forever, and writing a tool to do it automatically will be nearly the same amount of trouble as writing a 6502 emulator from scratch. The tile maps are different enough for scrolling to be a pain in the ass to convert depending on the NT mirroring.

The thing is that this is actually suppose to be usable. There are actually NES emulators for gba and gba flash carts, so this might work. But I don't think I'll need to do this.

Those are probably as close as you can get to NES games running on the GBC.<br /><br />If the GBA is OK, there are also a bunch of official ports released for it: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Classic_NES_Series_games">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_C ... ries_games</a><!-- m -->
