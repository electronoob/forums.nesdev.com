<br />Yeah, a while ago I was thinking of the best way to do this... I don't remember if I got to the same layout as you just did, but I guess this would be the best way to do it. There would be a lot of replicated tiles, because level-specific background animations would have to animate the whole 2KB bank. Also, 2KB doesn't seem like enough to hold all level-specific tiles. Maybe the level animations could be synced to the constant animations and use the first half of the bank that goes in slot 1 instead, but then each level would have to have a copy of the constant animations.
<br />
<br />Anyway, because of complications like this and the fact that the MMC3 wasn't cloned yet I decided to use CHR-RAM and a simpler mapper. A lot of cool stuff can still be done without CHR-ROM bankswitching or IRQs.

<br />Well I 100% agree here, but I was wondering something.
<br />
<br />When you want to change the attributes of only the top or the bottom metatile of the attribute block, is it okay to do a read-modify-write from $2007 ? I do that in my engine to split the attributes in lower and upper halves when I need to, so I have to read $2007 to do that. However it seems it breaks that rule, but it woks fine for me.
<br />
<br />The other option would be to have a 128 byte copy of attribute tables in system RAM, and to read-modify-write it, and do a copy of it to $2007. Would that be the "better" option ? But it sounds like it wastes bytes of RAM since the exact same thing will be stored in VRAM anyway.

<br />You're already wasting 256 bytes for OAM unless you're doing what Hot Seat Harry does and overlapping your variables with $Fx-hidden sprites.
<br />
<br />President, the side-scroller engine that I've put on a hopefully temporary hiatus, reads the map from the 32x12-metatile sliding window and then forms attributes based on that. The upper 2 bits of each metatile number hold the attribute, just as in SMB1. I don't think SMB1 even rewrites attributes when Mario interacts with tiles, which is why SMB1's "used ? block" is so simplistic.

<br />Are you really that short on RAM though? Many games I've seen are great games and have plenty of untouched RAM. If it performs well you might decide it's worth it for the RAM cost, particularly if that RAM would have otherwise gone unused.

<br />Yeah, inspiring myself on existing games certainly made it easier to find a place for everything in the constrained memory space, since I know what "everything" is. But if you are coming up with something completely new, it really helps to think the whole thing through so that you can make better use of your RAM.

<br />In fact, this is exactly what my game engine does ! It don't take too much time.
<br />However I have this annoying limitation 1 object = 1 metasprite.
<br />
<br />I have ways to disable the sprite if I want to make an invisible object (like one which triggers the end of the stage if the player collides with it).
<br />For a boss I'm developping, it has a huge armor and moving arm &amp; legs, but wasn't big enough to be drawn with BG. Since defining the identical armor sprites for all frames was taking WAY too much space, I decided to split the boss in 2 objects, the armor "dumbly" follow the true boss (which is only made of arms and legs) and display always the same frame.
<br />I'm still having major trouble with him (in fact he's the reason I haven't made any progress since 5 months) so I hope it will be as much a pain to players that it was a pain to me to code  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" />

So I've decided to let the objects themselves make decisions about how they'll be rendered, for performance reasons.</div>
<br />
<br />It's funny you guys are talking about this, because I recently had to code this part of my engine. I haven't yet reached the optimization stage of my project, but I'm pretty sure I'll be getting there really soon. With that said, I currently have AI and decisions about sprite drawing kind of separate. What I'm doing now is I have 7 bytes for each object set aside in RAM to handle animation. Each object can access 4 of these bytes. 2 point to the actual location of the animation "filmstrip", 1 gives some other commands, like whether or not to draw the sprite or to draw it flipped, and the other is used to specify with each bit which animation "number" is currently going on. By this, I mean I've basically allowed objects to only have 8 different animations, and I have a byte for each object in RAM where each bit represents one of these animations. It's mainly for the purpose of switching animations without glitches happening. Anyways...
<br />
<br />After objects specify what animation they want to have play for them, and whether or not they're flipped, the animation handler that comes after takes care of the rest. The animation handler looks at all these values that the objects put in RAM, and picks the appropriate sprite map out of the animation specified, and uses that object's X/Y coordinates to draw them. I know it's not good to use the object's physical coordinates to draw them on the screen all the time, but my game is simple enough where that's not a big deal. I think it is a terrible idea, actually, to leave animation up to the objects themselves. Well, with the way I handle objects it would be. In my AI code, I have to use pretty much all indirect addressing, since when an object is spawned it is given the next available section of AI RAM (if there is one. If there's not, which I will always try to prevent by designing levels intelligently, then the object doesn't get spawned. That's just so nothing catastrophic happens in a situation like that like the game crashing). In my animation handler, I've unrolled the loop so that it handles the animation for each object by directly reading from the animation RAM, while each object accesses it indirectly. All the indirect addressing + a million INYs or DEYs would add up very quickly.
<br />
<br />Also, I found myself pretty much having one metasprite and animation per object, though I can easily defy this limitation in the AI code itself. Only if I use the standard/universal animation handler will I have such limitations. I can push sprite maps onto my sprite stack from AI code if I needed to. I think I might have to do this for some more complicated looking enemies, if I see that I have them.
<br />
<br />EDIT: As for available RAM, I think I have about 242 bytes left. That's not including the stack, which I never touch besides with PHP/PHA/PLP/PLAs. I find it adds up pretty quickly. Zero Page is almost gone, but not yet. I think I have $23 bytes available. But let's see what I've dedicated to what:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Not Available:<br />-----------------<br />$00-$AE&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Misc. important variables, PPU buffers, Temp Vars, Temp Adds<br />$D2-$D7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Important variables relating to the level map<br />$D8-$DD&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Temporary variables for AI stuff<br />$DE-$DF&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Temp address for standard animation handler.<br />$E0-$FF&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Character information<br /><br />$100-$1FF&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Stack<br />$200-$2F8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Buffers of 8x2 and 2x2 tiles for map decoding purposes.

<br />
<br />But I find dedicating huge chunks of RAM to things like AI, sprite drawing, animation handling, sound, map decompression, the OAM page, etc. Adds up incredibly fast. As you can see I need to do some rearranging here, but for the most part that's what I'm looking at being left with. I actually don't know if I'll be needing to use any more RAM though. I've already got all the RAM I need to use set aside. So I used most of it, but not all of it.

The game logic can work on 1 color solid tiles both for background and sprites. Once the game logic is ready and working actual graphics can be put it to present the graphics in a better way.<br /><br />Could you direct me to a game code(preferably small) where this has been applied?</div><br />I still don't know if you're quite understanding.  You don't work on "1 color solid tiles," except in a logical/thematical sense.  For example, you might program your logic to say, every tile with an ID less than 32 doesn't count as a collision (these are background tiles), and every tile with an ID greater that 32 counts as a collision.  Or you might compress the map's data down to bitfields, so that a 0 is air and a 1 is solid ground:<br /><br />00001111<br />00000111<br />11000000<br />00000000<br />10001111<br />11111111<br /><br />You don't actually draw solid color tiles anywhere, you just treat your map as if it was.  Some games do store the graphical map and data as above in separate areas; the data is known as a collision map.  Collision data, solid ground data, is not drawn on the screen - it's just worked on by the engine.<br /><br />As for examples, nearly every platforming game does it this way, in one form or another.  I know that's not really much of an example...<br /><br />An easy way to start programming this way is to first get your game showing one screen with background graphics and everything, and one character sprite.  Lay out your map data in such a way that background stuff is all first in the PPU, and solid ground is last in the PPU.  Then whenever the character moves, you can compare the character's coordinates on the screen with the background tile you are on top of at the moment (this will probably require some conversions depending on how you store your map data).  If the sprite is on top of a solid tile, you don't allow that movement.<br /><br />Think of button presses as a "request" to move, so that you check your map data and say, hmm, if the character moved one pixel forward he would be intersecting solid ground - I guess I'll stop that movement.  This includes gravity.  If you add to the character's y value each frame to make them fall, check where the character would be if his y was increased by that amount, and if it's inside something, then roll back the change.  Put them back on their previous pixel coordinates.<br /><br />Does that make sense?  And yeah, it sounds complicated with lots of comparison, but you do have time in your engine to do it.  The trouble is when you've got 10 enemies that also "request" to move in a certain direction as well. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>
<br />
<br />
<br />Thanks for the detailed description. I am indeed using a collision map of 240 bytes for the whole screen(1 byte per 16x16 metatile). In my map a '1' is air and a '0' is solid. 
<br />I am applying gravity only if the character is not "grounded".
<br />
<br />In my last comment I quoted about "solid blocks". By that I meant that game logic is the more important thing and it should be working ok in the first place. Graphics can be put in at a later stage to give everything on screen a better and sensible look. So far I have created a screen and placed a couple of platforms on it. The sprite character I am using is nothing but a 16x16 rectangle.  
<br />
<br />At the moment I am trying to get background collision detection work with walking and jumping of my character.
