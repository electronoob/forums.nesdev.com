Thanks for the binary. I used to think that the algorithm that moves the camera to show more stuff in front of you was annoying, but the one that does the same thing, but only when you're moving felt worse. It gives a certain feel of interruption...<br /><br />If you are moving to the same side most of the time, the Sonic-type of camera feels good. Although the window in this demo was a bit large in my opinion.<br /><br />It was nice to get a direct comparison of algorithms. I missed trying the vertical scrolling along with the horizontal, though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat May 13, 2006 2:03 pm</p><hr />

Disch, your code seems to explain well what's going on. The window that Sonic has is indeed pretty narrow. And although it is quite tall, the camera tries to keep Sonic centered while he's on the ground. Maybe that's the trick?<br /><br />Also, Sonic's position doesn't seem to have a direct influence on the position of the screen. I feel like the screen has it's own speed, wich is what Sonic affects, and is what allows him to move faster than the camera.<br /><br />I though about the window approach before, but never tried it, thinking it would be bad to have more stuff behind you than in front of you. But if it is done like in Sonic, where the window is so narrow, it looks and feels ok. Also, as most of the Sonic action is left-to-right, I get the feel that the window is not exactly centered, it is placed a bit towards the left, leaving a larger visible area at the right, wich is where you'll usually be heading to.<br /><br />baisoku, a quick scan through your code hasn't allowed me to understand it yet. I'm kinda sleepy now, I'll try to look at it again tomorrow.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu May 11, 2006 9:04 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />And what about scrooling like in <em>Sonic</em> games? The camera is not "attached" to the player<br /></div><br /><br />Sonic scrolling style is what I call "slack" scrolling.  It doesn't make the camera rigid to Sonic, rather, it keeps Sonic within a designated rectangle on the screen.  When Sonic leaves that rectangle, the screen scrolls in the appropriate direction to keep him in the rectangle.  This actually works out to be a little worse than "attached" or "rigid" scrolling (the method I previously described) in some situation, but better in others.<br /><br />Although the Sonic engine is tricky in that it allows Sonic to actually leave the rectangle if he's going too fast for the drawing to keep up.  Rather than doing what's intuitive and just slowing Sonic (and the whole game) down until the drawing can keep up.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sonic in paticular gives lots of vertical slack (Sonic can get high on the screen, or low on the screen before the screen will actually start scrolling), but doesn't give much horizontal slack (Sonic is stuck pretty close to center at all times).  This works well for flat areas, so that when you jump, the ground you're trying to jump to is less likely to scroll off the bottom of the screen.  However it ends up being worse for falling long distances or moving upwards long distances since you're very close to the screen edge in both cases.<br /><br />Some NES games have slack scrolling with lots of Horizontal slack which is just AWFUL.  Wai Wai World comes to mind -- you have to get right up to the edge of the screen before it starts scrolling -- making it very difficult to see what you're walking into.  I think Goonies 2 has a little more horizontal slack than I'd like, too... but it's not nearly as bad.<br /><br /><br />Accomplishing slack scrolling is a bit more complex than rigid scrolling.  To give the idea (this could probably be improved/optimized a lot, especially with use of constants):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">draw_x = player_x - scroll_x;<br />if&#40;draw_x &lt; &#40;centerscreen_x - x_slack&#41;&#41;<br />  scroll_x = player_x - &#40;centerscreen_x - x_slack&#41;;<br />else if&#40;draw_x &gt; &#40;centerscreen_x + x_slack&#41;&#41;<br />  scroll_x = player_x - &#40;centerscreen_x + x_slack&#41;;<br /><br />if&#40;scroll_x &lt; x_min&#41; scroll_x = x_min;<br />if&#40;scroll_x &gt; x_max&#41; scroll_x = x_max;<br /><br />//ditto for y<br /></div><br /><br /><br />I usually stick to rigid scrolling because it's easier.  Though really, I prefer a sort of "preemptive" scrolling.  Much like the type of scrolling tokumaru didn't like -- except the way I'd impliment it is that it would only scroll left when you MOVE left (rather than just face left).  So that when you're moving left, the screen gradually scrolls so that your player gets closer to the right-hand side, showing more of what's to your left.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Thu May 11, 2006 3:31 pm</p><hr />
