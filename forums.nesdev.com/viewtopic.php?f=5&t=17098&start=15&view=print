		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In general, socially or politically-oriented discussions on nesdev are shunned for two reasons: 1) they're extremely off-topic for what this forum is as a whole (read: we come here for the tech stuff!), and 2) especially these days, many of us see/hear enough politics online as is (particularly true if you're American, even more so if you're on Twitter or Facebook).  I too would ask, politely of course, that you keep this type of thing off of the nesdev forum.  That goes for anyone, not just you!  :-)<br /><br />You have a right to whatever opinions you have (and I support you having that right), but if dealing with the fallout <em>public display</em> of those opinions is something you can't deal with (ex. tedious, stressful, unwanted drama, harassers, etc.) then it's best to simply not discuss those opinions in those public arenas (e.g. nesdev forum, YouTube, etc.).<br /><br />There will always be people on the Internet who dedicate time to digging up dirt on others; connecting YT accounts/channels, social media, etc. just to give a person grief.  There's always some jackass who for some reason can't just say &quot;wow, I really disagree with these opinions&quot; and leave it at that.  You should not &quot;live in fear&quot; of such jackasses, but if you're concerned about it happening, then solving it (for your own safety, sanity, etc.) is fairly easy: <span style="text-decoration: underline">don't talk about political/social subjects publicly</span>.  Save those discussions for private chats with people with whom you know personally.  Depending on your personality type (I'm an introvert), 1:1 conversations may hold more weight.<br /><br />pubby's recommendation to split your personal and tech stuff up into two separate YT channels is good advice (but see above paragraph).  My advice would be to simply stop involving those opinions in publicly-displayed subject material.  You can talk about programming, console dev, etc. without involving politics in the process.  If someone tries to coerce you into discussing it (through seemingly innocent questions), just tell them it's off-topic/irrelevant/inappropriate and move forward.<br /><br />TL;DR -- keep political stuff off nesdev, and follow the general advice of &quot;don't incite debate/arguments through public display of opinions if you can't accept the potential fallout, no matter how minor or major&quot;.  There are a lot of troublemakers online these days.
