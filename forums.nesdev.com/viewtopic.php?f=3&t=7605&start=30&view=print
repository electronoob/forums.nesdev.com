<br />None of them play the games themselves, so they suck. I absolutely need an emulator that will play the games for me, because after years of playing the games myself I feel very tired.
<br />
<br />Also, all emulators have very poor graphics, like they're stuck in the 80's... All new movies and games are in 3D, but those stupid NES emulators keep displaying old 2D images, how come? This is 2011 for God's sake, how can those stupid NES graphics still be 2D? The next NES emulator better be able to render everything with high-resolution polygons or else I'll abandon retro gaming for good.

<br />Hack the roms to make an ai that plays the game but thats based on the rom.

<br />Because none of the current emulators map tile numbers to pieces of polygon mesh. If they did, SMB1 could be made to look like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9k3XBQ59yk" class="postlink">it does in Brawl</a>. That would be an interesting research project: imagine the "high resolution texture packs" for N64 games taken up to 11.

<br />
<br />I would be happy if someone made an emulator or graphic plugin that makes a blocky circle into a circle and a image that was blocky but now enlarged into a enlarged version of the smoothed original sized version.
<br />
<br />It would make gaming much more awesome. Also what layer is the background image.
<br />You could examine whats on that layer and possibly make shading to the other objects.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Its called fake 3D.

<br />Which is exactly why they suck. I mean, I look at Mario's sprite and I can easily tell it's a fat plumber, so an emulator should be capable of realizing that too, and automatically swap Mario with a high-resolution 3D fat plumber. How hard can this be?
<br />
<br />I mean, I look at the NESemdev section of this site and it looks like all conversations are about boring things like IRQs, timing, DMA, OAM, tests, registers and other obsolete, useless things... That forum would be much more useful if we discussed about automatically improving graphics and audio to make the old games look like new games, so that everyone could download a single emulator and play their existing ROM collection (or watch it being played, automatically) without bothering to download anything else.

<br />That's entirely doable even on the Famicom hardware. Make a mapper that plays MP3 out the expansion audio pins, then mapper hack your games to use OCRemix music. A lot of early PC Engine CD and Sega CD games were ports from cartridge that did almost exactly this.

<br />Can such music be automatically generated by a software based on the original data? Because if a human is necessary to convert the music then I must say this is a very crappy solution.

<br />
<br />Any idea? Before flamming the "poor" 2D graphics with sprites, have you some idea about improving the things? Any C++ example of yourself, instead of always mentioning the very old NTSC filtering? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Also, don't expect to run SMB1 in 3D (or 2.5D) mode using polygons. It's all about replacement &amp; creation of each polygon. Meh.
<br />
<br />There was an MAME-based emulator that used improved gfx and music for games, like for Donkey Kong 1. I don't remember his name.
