		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here's some feedback on your draft manual.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 120%; line-height: normal"><strong>Overview unclear</strong></span><br /><br />What language is this library for? What kind of file do Pently commands go into? How do you include the Pently stuff into an NES development project?<br /><br />After I read the manual, I gather Pently is made of the following pieces, but I don't understand how they all fit together.<br /><br /><ul>methods<br />sound effects table and its entries<br />instruments table and its entries<br />songs table and its entries<br />conductor track and its commands<br />patterns and their rows of commands</ul><br />Maybe you could write an Overview section that describes how these pieces fit together, then have sections for each piece with more details.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 120%; line-height: normal"><strong>Pitch codes</strong></span><br /><br />The first place you mention the pitch codes N_C and N_CH, I was confused what they were because they hadn't been explained yet:<br /><br /><blockquote style="margin-left: 1%; padding-left: 1%; border-left: 3px solid #555577;">
Pitch values such that the pattern code N_C produces a C are [...] For example, [...] N_CH produces a middle C and N_C produces the C an octave below it.
</blockquote><br /><br />Later you mentioned N_BB, and I wasn't sure what the BB represented:<br /><br /><blockquote style="margin-left: 1%; padding-left: 1%; border-left: 3px solid #555577;">
For example, to play a short note for 4 frames followed by a note that is as long as a quarter note minus 4 frames, do GRACE,4,N_CH, N_BB|D_Q4.
</blockquote><br /><br />You finally imply the pitch code meanings at the end:<br /><br /><blockquote style="margin-left: 1%; padding-left: 1%; border-left: 3px solid #555577;">
The following are all the symbols that are valid in pattern bytecode: <br />Notes, low octave: N_C, N_CS, N_D, N_DS, N_E, N_F, N_FS, N_G, N_GS, N_A, N_AS, N_B<br />Notes, high octave: N_CH, N_CSH, N_DH, N_DSH, N_EH, N_FH, N_FSH, N_GH, N_GSH, N_AH, N_ASH, N_BH<br />Note, top of range: N_CHH<br />Notes, enharmonic synonyms: N_DB, N_EB, N_GB, N_AB, N_BB, N_DBH, N_EBH, N_GBH, N_ABH, N_BBH
</blockquote><br /><br />Maybe the pitch codes should be briefly explained somewhere, and any early references should mention or link to where they're explained later.<br /><br />For example, you might briefly explain how the pitch codes work (maybe insert those four lists of note codes) after this point:<br /><br /><blockquote style="margin-left: 1%; padding-left: 1%; border-left: 3px solid #555577;">
Each note is specified as a pitch relative to the transposition base. Only one note can be played on a channel at once. To stop a note without playing another, use a REST.
</blockquote><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 120%; line-height: normal"><strong>Fine meaning</strong></span><br /><br /><blockquote style="margin-left: 1%; padding-left: 1%; border-left: 3px solid #555577;">
fine [...] This command stops music playback.
</blockquote><br />In sheet music, the <em>Fine</em> notation means you stop the second time you encounter it. I'm confused if Pently's fine means &quot;stop unconditionally&quot; or &quot;stop the second time&quot;.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 120%; line-height: normal"><strong>Noise values</strong></span><br /><br /><blockquote style="margin-left: 1%; padding-left: 1%; border-left: 3px solid #555577;">
Pitch on a noise channel is $03 &#40;highest&#41; to $0F &#40;lowest&#41; for ordinary noise
</blockquote><br />I thought there were 16 possible noise values. Are you excluding some on purpose?<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 120%; line-height: normal"><strong>Why &lt; and - ?</strong></span><br /><br /><blockquote style="margin-left: 1%; padding-left: 1%; border-left: 3px solid #555577;">
TRANSPOSE,&lt;-12 moves down an octave
</blockquote><br />Why do you need both a &lt; and a - here?<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 120%; line-height: normal"><strong>Missing symbols</strong></span><br /><br />Many of the symbols show up as boxes in my browser (Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 8.1). I can see the sharp and flat symbols, but not the &quot;final barline&quot;, segno, and note symbols.

And those are pretty much the only real fonts that support them according to <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/musical_symbols/fontsupport.htm" class="postlink">Font Support for Unicode Block 'Musical Symbols'</a> on FileFormat.Info. (LastResort doesn't count because it's an OS X internal font that has the same glyph for all characters of each Unicode block.)

But it has the equivalent of FamiTracker's arpeggio envelopes, used to create the bass instrument in &quot;stairs&quot;. It also has &quot;legato&quot; and &quot;grace note&quot; effects, which can be used for appoggiatura (pitch change at the beginning of a note) such as in &quot;Happy Flappy Crappy&quot;.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It seems to me that support for both tracker and MML would be a good thing to have. MML does not seem to me to be a very good format for the native document format of a music tracker (Csound numeric score seems a better format for this purpose, which can even add support to the tracker for some advanced stuff; I have also written a program to compile MML into Csound numeric score format), but with comments to annotate it could be done (another alternative would be for the GUI to use annotated assembly language as its document format).<br /><br />However, neither of these seem suitable for the way Pently is working using conductor track. A GUI could easily represent it though, by having the patterns and other conductor commands placed into a grid. For text format, a variant kind of MML can be done. You can have &quot;Full MML&quot; which supports ABCDEZ tracks, and &quot;Conductor MML&quot; which is a subset of Full MML that supports only the Z track; a compiler can optimize and convert Full MML into Conductor MML, which is then compiled into assembly language.<br /><br />Patterns can be defined by lines starting by stuff like <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">!1</tt> and so on (you could do something like <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">!1,2,3</tt> to add the same notes to multiple patterns simultaneously, somewhat like <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">ABC</tt> in common MML); the MML compiler then automatically determines the length and base transpose value for each pattern (and base instrument if the pattern begins with an instrument selection), and then in the Z track you might specify <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">&#40;A1B3&#41;</tt> to play pattern 1 on the first square wave channel and pattern 3 on the second square wave channel, and then emit a waitRows command (looping or not looping patterns that are too short based on notations in the pattern itself). You could use <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">!A1</tt> to begin a pattern in ostinato mode (not emitting waitRows at this time) and then perhaps <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">!A.</tt> to stop ostinato mode. Loops in the Z track can automatically be compressed as necessary (example could be something like <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">[&#40;A1B2C5&#41;&#40;A1B3C5&#41;&#40;A1B4C6&#41;]4</tt>).<br /><br />These are just some idea about it; there can be more possibilities too.

Am I correct to say that the pitch compensation is handled by just playing 1 semitone higher? If so, I guess a 28 cent difference isn't too bad of a trade off for omitting another 160 or 128 byte table.

And the pitch is even closer between PAL NES and Dendy: about 12 cents higher on Dendy.<br /><br />Right now I'm trying to figure out how to implement alpha-to-gray in SDL 2 so I can get rolling on building a GUI framework for the tracker. Reply if you have experience with SDL 2. Or I could try learning GTK+ or Qt instead? If GTK+ or Qt, is there a good way to abstract over audio in Linux, Windows, and OS X?

Not sure how good it would be for a latency-sensitive application.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The two popular textual music description languages that I'm aware of (MML and LilyPond) express durations (half note, quarter note, eighth note) of successive notes differently. In MML, setting a duration on a note affects only that note: <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">l8 c d e4 f g</tt> makes the E a quarter note but all the rest eighth notes. In LilyPond, on the other hand, setting a duration affects all later notes: <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">c8 d e4 f g</tt> makes the C and D eighth notes and the rest quarter notes. I'm supporting both behaviors in Pently's music compiler tool, selected with the command <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">durations temporary</tt> or <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">durations stick</tt>. But I wonder which to make the default.
