		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Today my NES was behaving very strangely, where some code would crash while reading the first controller. If I had it only read $4016 seven times after strobing, it didn't crash, but on the eighth it did.    f I unplugged the first controller it would crash no matter what it was doing. Also, if strobe was kept set, pressing A on the controller would crash it. Very strange symptoms. The day before I had banged on a devcart out of frustration, and I thought maybe this had damaged something. No visible damage to the NES board though.
<br />
<br />I looked at the logic levels on the first controller input connector to see what was changing when I unplugged the controller. As expected, it was D0, which the button status come in on. It should normally be high. When it went low, it crashed. Reading $4016 eight times caused the controller to output low, since the shift register had been exhausted. Same for pressing A when strobe was held high. But with the controller unplugged, it should stay high, since it has an internal pullup. Checking the other input pins D3 and D4, they ALSO went low when D0 went low. Why would D0 affect the others?!? Something must have come unconnected. I traced D0 back to a resistor pack, which measured 10K on the pins up to a point, then they were open circuit. The pack looked OK from the front, but then I saw a hairline crack down the center. That was the breaking the common connection that runs its length. The damaged pullups included the one for NMI. I'm guessing this is an open-collector output on the PPU, so a broken pullup would cause unexpected NMI(s).
<br />
<br />For repair, I checked all my junk circuit boards for 10K resistor packs, but the closest I could find was 5K. I didn't want to have different values than before, because it would make my NES behave differently when testing hardware on it. The resistor packs are internally a strip of ceramic with carbon composition on the surface, with a metal strip along the top for the common connection. So I scraped the outer coating off along the top edge of the broken half until I exposed some of the metal, then soldered a very thin wire from it to common (used one strand from stranded wire). All resistances measure correct now, and I learned my lesson about being rough with my NES (the hours spent on this will make it hard to forget).
<br />
<br />So, weird symptoms that go away when one (or possibly two) controllers are plugged in = possibly cracked resistor pack. The pack is long and cracks easily, so bending of the main PCB can easily crack it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This damage occurred yesterday. I do sometimes wonder whether something specific to my NES could affect test results. Ideally I'd have at least one more NTSC NES of the same model. As it is, the PAL NES I have provides some determination as to the cause of problems. Sometimes things have been very strange and I've run on a PAL to be sure it wasn't my NES (for example, the crazy OAM behavior).

One might think that a 5K in series with the common would turn a 5K resistor pack into a 10K one, but think of what happens when the common is connected to +5V and one of the pins is grounded. All of the others then drop to 2.5V.

<br />If you use a separate scavenged resistor pack just to substitute for one broken 10K, I'd figure you can just leave all those 2.5 V pins NC.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No.... you've got a resistor pack that needs to pull 5 lines high via 10K each. I was saying that if you tried to use a 5K resistor pack in place of this, and put a single 5K resistor in series with its common, then when any one of those lines was forced low, all the others would then only be pulled up to 2.5V. So the only substitute for a 10K resistor pack is several individual 10K resistors.

Since I didn't check beforehand, I found out it was a somewhat obscure part (6 resistor, 7-pin is more common) but Digikey had them, at least.  I have some laying around, and I know Digikey should still have them too.

If I were going to bother replacing the current scheme I'm using (which checks out fine using a multimeter; behaves just like it originally did), I'd just solder five 10K resistors in.
