But my quote was more of what Nach and pagefault were saying on IRC. Sorry, after arguing with them about "what leads to hacks", seeing your comment got under my skin. It appeared to me you were saying the same thing they were. That using CRCs was akin to use game-specific hacks and/or encouraged using them. Which, so far, has not been the case for any NES or SNES emulator I'm aware of. In fact, it's been the very opposite. Whereas the emulators Nach and pagefault maintain <em>do</em> contain game-specific hacks. N64 and above, sure. Those use DBs for hack information. But that's not what system we're talking about here. Those systems could also just as easily use CRC detection internally to the emulator if they wanted. The fact they're using a DB makes no difference to their use of hacks.<br /><br />My apologies for misquoting you.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Wed Jul 19, 2006 7:05 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I think it's unfortunate that people deal with "ROM files" rather than "cartridge files", as the latter is a better idea.<br /></div><br /><br />I agree, putting all info into one file is definitely the best end goal, but this is much harder than it sounds, and a flexible database where you can change the format and not instantly break all old ROMs is a good interim solution. We need to know, down to every last bit, exactly what will be needed in a cartridge header, from now until forever.<br />Plus, as a nice bonus, this database will be needed by any ROM scanning tools to update the ROM headers when it does reach fruition. Emulators can even begin including an option to patch / auto-patch ROMs with DB info upon load.<br /><br />I don't believe an emulator using a database of "game a = mapper n" would put the author in legal trouble, but I'm not a lawyer. I also don't think any companies are planning to go after freeware emus. That's just bad press and you won't recover any damages. And people will just start distributing said emulator on piracy web sites anyway, and development will just move underground, harder to stop.<br />But then, you never know what VPs at Nintendo will plan once the Wii is out and they start relying on that emulation revenue.<br /><br />So, hopefully in the end we will be able to move all info into the ROMs. Just make sure you have the format finalized for all of time first before you try.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Do most tile editors and (especially) mainstream hex editors support soft patching, or is this an approach for end users and not developers of ROM hacks?<br /></div><br /><br />Tools adapted to copier and iNES headers. They will adapt to soft patching. In the mean time, any capable rom hacker could easily use automation, or one could always create cart-specific DB entries.<br />eg : cartname.nes looks for cartname.inf, falling back on cart.db if it does not exist. End users need not worry about this.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Unlike ZSNES, bsnes is proprietary software.

My code is plenty free. Free to use, free to distribute, free to obtain full source code, free to modify for personal use, free to submit any contributions to the source back to me for inclusion in the main branch.<br />I do not believe in forking, thusly this allows a unified project working toward one goal: emulation.<br />End users share the benefits of all contributions in one emulator. They aren't forced to choose between bsnes, bsnes Ultra XD SP, UO bsnes PP SE (unofficial) ++, etc. to get the specific options they want.<br />I also have no intentions of competing with someone who rips off my code, changes two things, and releases their own "version" claiming it to be superior.<br />And ultimately, I don't want someone hijacking and ultimately taking lead over my project because they added a few nice features and have more time than me to work on even more features. See Xorg.<br />You want to compete with me? Make your own emulator, just like I did. You want to collaborate and make the emulator better? Please do, I accept source contributions from anywhere.

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The emulator needs to know whether to enable a light gun in slot 2 (Duck Hunt), a dance pad in slot 2 (World Class Track Meet), a potentiometer in the expansion port (Arkanoid), etc. That info would normally be on the label of the cartridge, which is not present in an iNES file.<br /></div><br /><br />Since it's the user who plugs those controllers into the NES, an accuracy-at-all-costs emulator would require the user to manually command it to plug in a particular controller. You could even plug in the wrong controller for a particular game and get the same effect you'd get on a NES. In essence, the user is left to manually configure the NES hardware for these particular games, so it's definitely not part of the cartridge.<br /><br />As for where to draw the line between a NES emulator and cartridge files, an important side-effect of the location is the legality of the emulator. I imagine that an emulator with a built-in database of commercial NES games (or built-in functionality for one, like GoodNES) would make it much more susceptible to legal issues. It seems best that the emulator incorporate as little as possible outside the NES control deck hardware. The biggest exception to this is the behavior of mapper hardware, which would be quite hard to specify entirely in the NES cartridge file without imposing a significant performance penalty on the emulator. If we accept that mapper behavior will be stored in the emulator, everything else can be stored in the NES cartridge file.<br /><br />I think it's unfortunate that people deal with "ROM files" rather than "cartridge files", as the latter is a better idea. Why would you just want the data in the ROM of a cartridge, rather than that plus the wiring information and other behavior? There's nothing hacky about representing this other information in the cartridge file; it's just your standard encoding of information in a machine-readable format.<br /><br />I can see the use of a database in automatically filling in the cartridge hardware information when someone uses a cartridge dumper so they can play the game on their PC. People experienced with the hardware can ensure that the database entries are correct, and (presumably) distribute this information without infringing on any copyrights, since it'd contain things like "Wizards &amp; Warriors, mapper = AOROM" or whatever. Combine this database with a dump you make of your own cartridge and you have enough information to play it on an emulator, either by building a self-contained cartridge file or letting the emulator do the equivalent of this internally.<br /><br />I think I have to agree with byuu's central point that a database is the main thing to build. A nice side-effect is that the file format need not be set in stone, since a programmatic interface can be provided with insulates the emulator from the particulars. An emulator could locate an entry based on the name or various checksums, then find what mapper it uses, how big the WRAM is, etc. The user might want to be able to use multiple databases from different sources, in case one is more reliable but doesn't cover as many games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Mon Jul 17, 2006 8:43 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I fail to see the distinction between CRC checks to correct headers, and CRC checks to correct ROM quirks (like Megaman 3's sloppy enemy select screen), or even CRC checks to correct emulation issues.<br /></div><br /><br />Then you have a perception problem. You either store the info in an open database that all emulators use and is easily upgradeable to the latest version (possibly even make the emu have an auto update feature ala Firefox), or you stick it into ROM image headers. Either way, it's just extra info that runs the game. You stick it in the ROM, now you get to try and convince 50% of the NES userbase that still thinks NESticle is "good enough" to replace all of their ROMs. Not. Gonna. Happen.<br /><br />A ROM image is just that, a copy of the ROMs on a PCB. Sticking cart information into a ROM image is as hackish as sticking it into a database is.<br /><br />Insisting that a database leads to game specific hacks is stupidity. I could just as easily claim all emulation leads to piracy, and school dances lead to pregnancy. If someone wants to add hacks to their emulator, they will do it -with or without- a database. The database won't make it any easier for them at all. AT ALL. I've heard <em>three</em> respectable emulation scene people cite this exact reason and it's completely absurd.<br /><br />As for ROM hacks, you can simply advocate soft patching, as we should all be doing in the first place, and then check the CRC against the database prior to patching. In the event someone modifies the game so greatly as to require a new mapper to run, then you fall back on the updated header approach.<br /><br />I don't get why this has to be one way or the other, period end of story. The best thing to do is everything you can to eliminate your current problem: shitty old iNES headers. You do both, and then when one gets to be accepted by the majority, you go with that.<br /><br />The DB has advantages, too. You don't need to have your userbase upgrade all of their ROMs, ROM sites don't have to update their content, you no longer have the 16-byte size limitation so you can store all the info you want in the DB, and then some. Collision problems are stupid. Store an SHA512 hash if you're worried about that. Nobody will even be <em>able</em> to make a collision in that for the next 3-5 years, at least. You also now don't have to worry about accidentally patching in wrong info into a ROM header, or missing a field you find out you need later on. The database is self-correcting and much easier to update than updating all ROMs everywhere.<br /><br />And so does the ROM header upgrade idea. It's more flexible for ROM hackers to take advantage of, for one.<br /><br />Either way, you need a database. Either to use directly in emus, or to make the ROM scanning tool that patches all of the headers. Why not agree to make the database now, and <em>then</em> bicker over which method is better, and let each emu author choose what they want to do?<br /><br />EDIT: thought this was an amusing point to reference here as well.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">I wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />pagefault, Nach and Disch oppose the use of a database because it "encourages adding game-specific hacks to correct emulation bugs". And yet, the emulators that do use databases are bsnes, Super Sleuth and Nestopia; written by me, Overload and Marty. The emulators that don't support databases are ZSNES, SNES9x and NESticle. You tell me what's wrong with that.<br /></div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Mon Jul 17, 2006 7:04 pm</p><hr />

Well of course if you want to play semantics you can find and pick out technical holes in my analogy, but my point remains clear.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Mon Jul 17, 2006 6:55 pm</p><hr />

The emulator needs to know whether to enable a light gun in slot 2 (Duck Hunt), a dance pad in slot 2 (World Class Track Meet), a potentiometer in the expansion port (Arkanoid), etc. That info would normally be on the label of the cartridge, which is not present in an iNES file.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Jul 17, 2006 5:41 pm</p><hr />
