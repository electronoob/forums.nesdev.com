		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi everyone,<br /><br />a few days ago I finished some debugging feature plans I had for bsnes-plus in order to debug some games I work on.<br /><br />As it would be nice to maybe create a pull request to maybe merge it into the original bsnes-plus version I'd like to have some people to test the new feature.<br /><br />You can download and compile it from this page:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/BenjaminSchulte/bsnes-plus">https://github.com/BenjaminSchulte/bsnes-plus</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><img src="https://github.com/BenjaminSchulte/bsnes-plus/raw/master/debugger.jpg?raw=true" alt="Image" /><br /><br />New features of the debugger are:<br /><br /><ul><li> The disassembler and debugger are now merged into one window.</li><li> The disassembler has some simple syntax highlighting</li><li> The disassembler supports WLA symbol files (located as .sym file in the same directory as the ROM)</li><li> The disassembler displays the address names instead of the addresses, if known</li><li> You can follow JMP and BRA addresses by clicking on them</li><li> You can toggle breakpoints by clicking on the address</li><li> You can name addresses by right clicking on the line</li><li> There is an index of all names (=Symbol) which can be filtered</li><li> You can add comments to disassembled lines</li><li> There is a feature to break on BRK opcodes</li><li> You can pass --break-immediately to the disassembler to debug from the very beginning</li><li> A new debug port which allows you the log static messages directly from your ROM</li><li> The disassembler tries to figure out the upfollowing code, even if its the first time you disassemble it</li><li> Displays some simple loops</li><li> If activated, all names and comments will be stored in a .sym file when closing the emulator for next time</li></ul><br />However, as I only work with a few original ROMs, I didn't really test the new emulator very well, so I'd like you to test the new features and let me know:<br /><br /><ul><li> Does this actually work on Mac and Windows? (I only work using Linux)</li><li> Did I accidentally remove an important feature?</li><li> Is there a must-have-feature you really, really would miss here?</li><li> I only tested the main CPU, the other processors should still work but have very limited features. Does this still work?</li><li> Are there some new bugs I missed? (If so, please let me know which game and how to reproduce)</li></ul><br />Have a great day!

I think after the next upcoming (hopefully soon) release of bsnes-plus I'd love to consider integrating this into a future release as well.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">HihiDanni wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">This looks quite comprehensive!

I don't think it should be too difficult to support both.

I suggest using mixed-case names for enum values instead.<br /><br />Either way, this looks really great so far! I haven't tested it extensively to make sure everything behaves as it should but I'm excited about this nonetheless.

I think I'll try to fix the windows version by the end of the next week and also check out the CA65 assembler in order to also support their symbol files later.

Maybe someday this could go into a separate file or so.<br /><br />I also added &quot;exporting a dump&quot; to my personal ToDo list, but I don't have that much time currently, due to two other big projects <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
