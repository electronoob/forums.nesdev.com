<br />That game is amazing... it's like the 8 sprites per scanline limitation doesn't exist (the person that made the video didn't disable it on the emulator, right? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />)! EDIT: I played the game and indeed that video was made with the sprite limit disabled. The game is still interesting, but not as impressive.
<br />
<br />Since this topic is about the GB after all, does anyone know of anything remotely similar for it? What are the best examples of impressive GB games?

<br />Which wasn't a very good idea, some of the effects suffered because of the non-grayscale palette (the top of the mountains at the end are red!).
<br />
<br />Anyway, I think demos are a poor indication of a machine's power to run games. They are interesting for a while (although I usually find the music very repetitive), but non-interactive programs become uninteresting very quickly. I'm interested to know what these machines are capable of when running actual games.

Demos show at least what is possible in a cutscene. And what can be done in cutscenes can be done in Quick Time Event-style games such as Dragon's Lair, parts of Resident Evil, and (I know NovaYoshi's going to yell at me for this one) WarioWare.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'm interested to know what these machines are capable of when running actual games.</div>
<br />If a machine is capable of that "rotating warping column" effect that's overused in demos, then it's capable of the road-warping effect seen in F1 Race and Rad Racer, and it's capable of the "morphmation" effect used for the Yoshi's Island bosses.

How many players start playing the exact same game after getting a game over? Games are different every time you play because of their interactivity, which means they can usually keep people interested much longer than non-interactive activities can. All video game consoles have controllers (or some other form of input), and IMO the software they run is much more interesting when they make use of that.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Demos show at least what is possible in a cutscene.</div><br />Which doesn't say anything about the games themselves, like I said before. Are people amazed that a PS3 can display the most impressive graphics ever if all it's doing is playing a Blu-Ray quality pre-rendered video generated by hundreds of super computers? Most demos on old consoles are just like that, pre-calculated data and scripted events that say nothing about what the machine is capable of dynamically, when the effects must be able to change based on input and the CPU has a lot more to worry about than just the graphics and music.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And what can be done in cutscenes can be done in Quick Time Event-style games such as Dragon's Lair</div><br />Those games have very low replay value, probably because they look so much like movies.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If a machine is capable of that "rotating warping column" effect that's overused in demos, then it's capable of the road-warping effect seen in F1 Race and Rad Racer</div>
<br />Every machine since the Atari 2600 can do road-warping effects, that's no indication of anything. And you never know if an effect used in a demo can in fact work in a game until someone actually tries to put it in a game, and the road warping just happens to have been use a lot!

<br />
<br />To make the flying frogs overlap and make the scroll changes less obvious, they made the fins as sprites.

<br />As I pointed out years ago on forum.gbadev.org, it's too bad rhythm games like DDR and Guitar Hero are patented. Otherwise, it'd be fairly easy to turn a demo that doesn't use all the sprites into a game by putting a plane of arrows in front of the effects and then changing the demo effects based on the player's accuracy.
<br />
<br />But I understand your thesis: capabilities exposed by the demoscene in its abstract music videos aren't very well correlated with capabilities required by a wide range of video game genres.
