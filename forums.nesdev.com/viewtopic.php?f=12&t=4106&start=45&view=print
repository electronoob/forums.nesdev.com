<br />Hm. Where's the point in using the U2 ROM if the SPC can access the table in the $50 bank - at that point it should be able to access compressed data in there also, or what do you think? I think that _is_ actually the only thing that we should check, along with the pass throug (which I didnt had a chance to check by now, am out of home until monday :/, but I have everything ready).
<br />
<br />nevitksti : in case the clock doesn't get passed through, I presume a simple cable from the gdsf's snes slot pin 1 to the top slot pin should do the job, right?

<br />
<br />Well, register $4800 returns a "continuous value" from bank $50.
<br />What I have seen in FEoEZ (and mds, if i remember it correctly), is that the games 
<br />
<br />a) setup the SPC
<br />b) activate the decompression
<br />c) dma the data from bank $50 to WRAM
<br />
<br />I recall having been searching for some $4800 register use, but I couldnt find it..

If you're not emulating the physical gates in the ROM containing the compressed data, you're merely providing the same data that would be read out of it when accessed.

You're always treating some parts as black boxes and simply emulating the high-level behavior, not how they work internally.<br /><br />I'm not saying that there's no reason to RE this decompression chip, just that it seems much less significant than other unknown things related to SNES emulation, like whether the S-DSP has a processor or is all hardware.</div>

<br />I'm not suggesting we should stop here, indeed. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> I would like seeing the hardware emulated to the atomic level but, as it wouldn't be doable, you have to stablish a level of abstraction that separate the things you are emulating from the things you are only simulating. I'm conscious of that
<br />
<br />As to whether this is less or more important that other unemulated behaviors, you can be right, but i'm not saying this should be given higher priority. Simply i volunteer for this because, with my current skills, i can help with it, while possibly i lack the skills and the background to help with other issues. Besides, i like studying certain types of algorithms, so potentially this can be funnier for me. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />I can't argue with that. It's a problem that's well-defined, and there's no loss if no progress is made, since the higher-level behavior (access to the decompressed data) is already emulated.

Caitsith suggested a very optimistic possibility that we can write to some internal RAM in the chip and use that for the table and/or the compressed data.  Yes that is worth checking (although it is not clear what to check), but that is _not_ the "only thing" worth checking.  In fact, the actual idea (which caitsith was just expanding upon) most likely will work given our current understanding (we don't need to search for new features, but merely check that our understanding is correct).<br /><br />So the short explanation is this:<br />- we have some decompression data from the chip using particular 4 byte entries (24bit address plus some indicator byte)<br />- so now let's try every possible 4 byte entry to get more data to study (more likely we'll have a program search the compressed data ROM for some good entries to look at instead of dumping them all)<br /><br />Hopefully the idea makes more sense now.  Currently we don't even have data for all the possible first byte combinations... that would be a great start and quite feasible.  We can also try to get as many first two byte combinations as possible.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">kyuusaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">OK, maybe now it would be best to just interface the SPC ROM emulator directly to the SNES.

<br />I thought about this some more and I think I have a one chip solution that requires much fewer connections.
<br />
<br />an asynchronous unidirectional FIFO
<br />any of the Cypress CY7C419/21/25/29/33 chips would work great.  
<br />
<br />
<br />steps for modification:
<br />- cut trace to /CE on the compressed data ROM (U2), and tie pin to Vcc
<br />- attach Vcc and GND to FIFO, and attach /XI, D8, /FL to Vcc
<br />- attach FIFO output data lines 0-7 to U2-ROM data lines
<br />- attach FIFO input data lines 0-7 to SRAM data lines
<br />- attach FIFO /R to U2-ROM /OE from SPC7110
<br />- attach FIFO /W to SRAM /CE
<br />- attach FIFO /RESET to SNES /RESET (or RTC /CE if you want to have sofware reset capability)
<br />
<br />So from the SNES you can load up the FIFO memory by writing to SRAM.  You can also do a software reset of the FIFO if need be by doing any access to the RTC (software reset probably isn't needed, you could just attach that to the SNES /RESET instead).
<br />
<br />The Datarom dumping feature of the SPC7110 can be used to easily test the setup before tackling decompressions.  For decompressions, if the SPC7110 makes some kind of "spurious" reads to the ROM that we can't figure out, then this setup wouldn't work.  Considering that it is crunched for time, I can't think of any reason it would have any "spurious" reads.  It probably just reads:
<br />... 4 bytes (24bit address + 1 byte indicator) from "table"
<br />... and then sequentially reads from the compressed data
<br />
<br />Sounds do-able to me.
<br />Comments anyone?
<br />
<br />Kammedo, does this sound okay to you?
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />In stock parts:
<br />Digikey, or Mouser CY7C433-10JXC ... $10.58
<br />Avnet  CY7C421-20JXC  .... $3.39
<br />
<br />These are all 28-pin PLCC's.
<br />If you prefer DIP packages for ease of hobby work, you can get all kinds of chips from: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rocelec.com/">http://www.rocelec.com/</a><!-- m -->  (They list stock, but not prices online.  I sent for some quotes out of curiousity.)
<br />
<br />Cypress also says on their site they will give people 10 free samples.  I haven't looked into it though.  (Back in the day, companies would give free samples because if people got hooked on their product they would likely use it at 'work' too.  Now a days very few companies give free samples unless you are from a company and it is understood that if the product prototype works you will buy large quantities from them.)  If you're lucky they'll give you some samples without hassle if you say you're a student...  might as well give it a try.

<br />
<br />Hm. beware, SRAM is decoded and mapped (! through a dedicated register) by the SPC itself.
<br />
<br />But for the rest, there is one slight glitch. Remember, the U2 ROM has to hold both compressed data and the table of pointers used for decompression. 
<br />
<br />So this means you need random access, which obviously is not suitable for the FIFO. BUT. The other solution would be using the FIFO chip to store  compressed data _only_, and the SPC internal RAM (bank $50 again) for storing the pointer table. 
<br />So far we don't know if the SPC RAM is accessible from the SPC decompression engine itself, in read operation. I presume its not, why provide a separate bus then? But untill im 100% sure of that I don't want to shot it down.
<br />
<br />I dont think the SPC does some initial ROM checks by itself, all the checks are piloted at software level (at least in the ROMs i checked, all is possibleb obviously...). I have to retrieve the old traces I did. Mainly, most of the checks do write / read some data from / to the $50 bank, testing S-ram data and address bus, data port, compressed length, Data ports B,O,S (which I dont recall what they are).

<br />A GDSF3 I tested is capable of running Mario Kart through the top, but I don't think it's memory mapping capabilities are as sophisticated as the GDSF7's, so maybe passthrough header flags aren't an option. I can test with a GDSF6/7 too but I think it's because of the passthrough feature that they're the ones that require the bottom DSP adapter.

<br />As I understand it, the table/index/pointer data is really irrelevant because it doesn't affect the algorithm so you can give it fake setup data and then valid compressed data and achieve the same results. The only thing is this relies on predictable access from the SPC and the ability to find out the addressing sequence, which may be easy.

The only thing is this relies on predictable access from the SPC and the ability to find out the addressing sequence, which may be easy.</div>

<br />Yes, figured it out 5 mins after  I posted (again). No need to worry about that at all. So yes, it would reduce the number of components, but wouldnt a double-sram (with the U2 overbridged to the SNES bus) be more feasible?
<br />
<br />As for the GDSF7, yes it doesnt run the FEoEZ cart from the top slot...I recall Darkforce telling that some changes to the GDSF were needed  in order to make it run. I have the DSP exp, but at home. Ill see if I can get the GDSF to make it work. Any suggestions?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The primary thing here, is that the game is expecting direct communication with the spc.  If there is no clock going to the spc, then communication can not happen.  You basically have to pass Pin 1 of the cartridge connector from the bottom side, directly to the top side somehow, as that is the clock for this chip.
