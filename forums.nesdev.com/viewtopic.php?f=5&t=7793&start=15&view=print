I tried it in two other systems to make sure the drive was dead, and I've put a HDD in my laptop and re-installed Windows on it, so I know the SATA controller isn't dead. I am RMA'ing it now.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Man, that's total crap.  Usually I expect stuff to fail a lot sooner than that, 4 months is enough time to get comfortable with it.  My OCZ drive is a Vertex 2, what was yours?
<br />
<br />With my "failing" HD (haven't RMA'd it yet, still worked last time I tried it, and the Seatools diagnostic program is worthless because it won't test it) I was able to copy everything off without losing anything.
<br />
<br />A while back I started using this "MozyHome" backup program, the free version of it will backup (I think) 2GB remotely.  Only annoyance is that it sometimes pops up saying "your files have been backed up" if it think the computer is idle, which tends to be when we're watching netflix or something.  Worth it though to me to know if my house burned down or my PC got stolen, at least I'd still have my projects.
<br />
<br />The only HD I ever lost was a 120MB one a long time ago, I actually had my first NES hacking attempt on it, where I modified the source code to Mouser.  For some reason I had posted it to Usenet once, thus later on I was able to request it and actually got it back (the ROM, at least).  That HD too later on I managed to make an image of 80% of it, and from that used a music-ripping program to rescue a whole lot of stuff I made in Fasttracker 2.

<br />
<br />I feel your pain, man and have been through a couple of hd and/or other failures over the years. It sucks epically. Eventually had to retire my first computer that you and I built over that one christmas, felt bad putting it down for good.
