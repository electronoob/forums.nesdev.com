<br />
<br />One crazy idea is to use a bypass chip that swaps the pin 4 of the CIC to a pin in the cart so that the NES has the key and the cart has a bogus lock.
<br />
<br />This is known otherwise as installing a mod-chip.
<br />
<br />Don't blame me if you fry your NES trying to get that to work in order to make newer retail carts work of which test for a key CIC in the NES.

<br />
<br />nineTENdo:  I'm not the smartest person or would even call myself a novice Nintendo developer at this point, but I remember reading Mark Knibbs's lock out chip disable document YEARS and YEARS back and it worked.  It's SPECIFICALLY what tepples is talking about.  Please perform ONLY this method.  Cut it; pull it out; or snip and ground it.  All of those methods will work.
<br />
<br />jargon has warned you about bricking your NES, though.  Kudos, jargon.  Perhaps you're enlightening to your own overwhelmingly long-winded nonsense.  A hardy commendation to you, sir.
<br />
<br />And as for a favor to all people, please DO NOT supply false, untested, or unproven information to someone innocently asking a relevant question.  I am no moderator or high-standing individual in the scene, but since nobody will ban you -- and about 10% of the time you ARE informational -- please pick and choose your words.

<br />
<br />This is otherwise known as nonsense.  Doing this will do nothing useful.  Cutting pin 4 on the chip in the NES is the proper way to disable the lockout chip.
