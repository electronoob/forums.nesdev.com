I know it seems like there should be one multi-cart per compo and visa versa, but I think having the compo a regular annual or biannual thing should happen even if the current volume didn't fill up at the time. Optimistically I see the ratio for multicart's to compo's at 2:3.<br /><br />For me starting the compo was also starting NES programing, and I had to take a good month just to learn the basics. So I wonder if there's something special we can offer for newcomers the month before the compo (and I an unusual case)?<br /><br />I also failed to understand what the app category was meant for. I thought &quot;small games&quot; rather then &quot;small tools&quot;.<br /><br />Edit PS: to clarify I meant biannual to mean every other year.

Optimistically I see the ratio for multicart's to compo's at 2:3.</div><br />I'd say 1 multicart for each 2 compos if we want to keep doing 4 Mbit multicarts. The first multicart had a <em>very</em> extended submission period for unjudged entries, and one of the submissions (I Wanna Flip the Sky) was actually for a different compo entirely. The second is only three-fourths full four months after the deadline for the judged categories. To make an annual release cycle for multicarts, we might need to step it up and have two judged compos a year. Or we might need to add other non-game categories, such as a graphics compo or a music compo that specifically targets the subset of FamiTracker that Shiru's FamiTone engine can play.

The SFX editor needs its bugs ironed out, and the waveform is not obviously belonging to a column. Some change making it obvious which channel each column plays on might be preferable to the current &quot;currently-selected column's waveform only&quot;.

(Biennial?) In conjunction with the first rule-note, additional competitions do not necessarily grant additional coding-time, so it might have the effect of just bringing down the coding-time per entry, making the entries worse overall. (This was my comment more for the twice-a-year idea.) <strong>I'm probably overthinking this and the above.</strong><br /><br />Similarly, you would need more prize money for more competitions.<br /><br />I would think annual would be nice, simply because it would motivate me to get my tools in order so I can participate next year.

I suppose strict seriality is not required, but it would seem to reduce the value. Of course, the judges could then have a get-together to mesh the winning/meritorious entries into some strict hierarchy, but...<br /><br />Idea (likely incompatible with manufacturing realities): Gold/silver/bronze-colored carts for winning entries.

I think it depends on what you mean by &quot;polished&quot;.<br /><br />Back then, developers would rather have a scrolling screen with bad graphics than a still screen with better graphics, because scrolling was considered awesome back then. Also you'd never EVER have a non 8x8 font in <em>any </em>game. That's this kind of stuff I mean. Don't get me wrong, this is nice and all, but it doesn't feel &quot;NES&quot; like philosophically.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />True, Shiru's games have a distinct visual style that doesn't quite mesh with the prevailing design norms of the mid- to late 1980s. But at this point we have to tread carefully to avoid &quot;no true Scotsman&quot; fallacies. As I understand the consensus, though LJN is bad, it's still better than Color Dreams, and Color Dreams is better than Active Enterprises. (There were some Color Dreams games I enjoyed, but that's beside the point.) I'll take any style as long as it's no worse than LJN.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Also you'd never EVER have a non 8x8 font in <em>any </em>game.</div><br />Plenty of NES games use 8x16 for short strings, and Snake Rattle n Roll uses 16x16. But apart from the menu of the first compo's multicart, you're right that I can't think of any commercial NES games that use VWF for Latin script, except for a few prerendered VWFs like the copyright notices in <em>Klax</em>, <em>Rampart</em>, and <em>Tetris 2</em>.
