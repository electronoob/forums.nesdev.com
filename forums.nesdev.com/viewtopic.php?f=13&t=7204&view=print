		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd like to see a new forum under NES / Famicom for Personal Projects.  This would be a place for people to create threads devoted to their personal homebrew games, utilities or other projects.  You'd post screenshots, YouTube links, progress updates and the like.
<br />
<br />I like to follow other peoples' projects, but they tend to get lost in the mix in the main NESdev forum.  Having them all in one place would make it easy to see what everyone is working on, and it could be another way to attract non-programmers to the forums (artists, musicians and fans).  I know on the RHDN forums there are many people who don't rom hack, yet follow the <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php/board,11.0.html" class="postlink">projects forum</a> because they just love games and want to talk about and play the (in RHDN's case) hacks.  I think we could attract a similar type of audience for homebrews if we had a place that said "look - here's what people are working on" and invited them to join the discussion and offer feedback.
<br />
<br />It would also clear up some clutter in the main NESdev forum.  Programming and technical discussions in the NESdev forum.  Show off your projects in the Personal Projects forum.
<br />
<br />Compared to two years ago it feels to me like more and more people are getting into nesdev and starting game projects.  New games are getting released on cart, the wiki is filling up with more programming articles and I'm seeing more and more NESdev-related videos showing up in my "suggested videos" sidebar on YouTube.  I think it's time.

<br />They do have a <a href="http://www.atariage.com/forums/forum/29-homebrew-discussion/" class="postlink">Homebrew Discussion</a> area. It is used for all kinds of systems though, not only Atari ones.

<br />
<br />I know.  I face the same dilemma.  I'm itching with excitement over my current project.  I'm debating if I want to enter it into the coding compo, or spend a bit more time polishing it and possibly attempt to sell it through retrousb.
<br />
<br />I so very much want to "spill the beans" and post screen-shots and recruit a few private beta-testers...  But I keep holding back as I'm unsure if doing so will spoil the compo (if it is even going to happen) or jeopardize my opportunity to sell through retorusb (and those options seem mutually exclusive anyway).
<br />
<br />It is very exciting to keep my project a secret until the "very end", but I wonder if doing so will hurt my opportunity to make it the best that it could be.

<br />Sivak posted videos of Battle Kid and gave copies of parts of the game to beta testers before selling copies through retrousb. We had <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=6046" class="postlink">a topic about beta test security</a> several months back.
<br />

<br />Neither ! If it is created I probably won't use it as I'd rather keep the surprise and that's all. I won't be pissed or anything if it is created though.
