If I remember well, OPL-3 was this chip used in old PCs as a (terrible) MIDI synth. I used to make a lot of music with it (without knowing it) back when I was a kid, but now I hate it's sound - brings back bad memories of having such a lame lowcost soundcard on my PC. Now thank to BASSMIDI and soundfonts I can have high quality sound fonts without even needing a dedicated sound card.<br /><br />Back on topic - I think the VRC7 sounds quite similar to the OPL-3, but I think it's even worse as it lacks drums, has only 6 channels, and only a single customizable channel. Well again, I like PSG and PCM, but FM modulation is not my cup of tea, probably because of what I just said above.<br /><br />I agree NSF + SID would be cool, in fact this probably would have happened if Nintendo didn't remove the possibility of sound expansion in their westen cartridges. While the SID was extremely popular in western countries, it was probably unknown in Japan.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Desolder the FDS mapper chip and put it on a custom board.<br /></div><br />There is quite a few chips in the RAM adapter, they are somewhat undocumented. It would be easy to see which one is responsible for the extra audio channel by looking at the PCB layout, but it probably has some other functionalities too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Or the Sega CD. Or the TurboGrafx-CD. Or the Nintendo Play Station (which was canceled here but apparently did see release in the Potterverse). I think the Game Boy Color had something called &quot;Pocket Music&quot; that would work only on a Game Boy Color because the Game Boy Advance lacked the analog audio path. The GBA needed its own version that worked with the GBA's PCM channels.<br /></div><br />I forgot about the XXX-CD consoles because they weren't released in Europe and they are almost like new consoles in themselves, like the FDS is almost a different console than the NES (at least GameFaqs separates them in different &quot;consoles&quot;).<br />I never heard about the Pocker Music, and other than that I don't think any GB carts ever used the extra audio pin, which is so much a shame. But I can understand why companies would choose to place a good sound chip in consoles rather than assuming the extra costs of having an additional sound chip in many manufactured cartridges.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Are you talking about the original SNES version by Nintendo or Hummer Team's port to the Famicom?<br /><br />But let's look at it: Imagine DMC set at the slowest rate ($0). This would tick once every 428 cycles (4182 Hz) and fetch a byte every 3424 cycles (522 Hz). Now imagine using the DMC to play a 1-byte $00 sample with an IRQ at completion. A music engine that doesn't use DMC for audio would end up not making an update most of the time the IRQ handler calls it, so still only a few percent.<br /></div><br />I was talking about the SNES Super Mario World, whose music's engine updates at 500 Hz (as does most of Nintendo's SNES games). Of course it would be possible on the NES, but your music engine would have to be <em>extremely</em> fast since it will be called 10 times per PAL frame. Updating 2 or 3 times per frame sounds like a better compromise to me, if meant to be used in a game of course.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Hooking up an OPL3 or similarly powerful chip to a Famicom and writing music for it is a fantasy of mine actually.

For example, don't put code at mapper port addresses if you're also using FDS, and make sure the Sunsoft 5B's port address is at $0E or $0F while writing to the N163.

I apologise to sound arrogant and to have driven you to tears, and yes I would never get in the way of a music compositor for dumb reasons.<br /><br />However, what I was saying is that using more than one expansion chip makes few sense. Don't get me wrong, I am facinated by expansion chips too, and as I said above, I made several songs for them in PPMCK just for the sake of trying expansion chips, without any intent to use this in a game or demo ! I perfectly see where the fascination for expantion chips come. In fact the Famicom is probably the only video game console to ever had something such as expansion sound chip (if you don't count SNES's Super GameBoy).<br /><br />The point is, the fact the .nsf format allows multiple expansion chips at the same time was, technically, purely <em>accidental</em>. Some guy decided some day that the .nsf format was like this, that every existent expansion chip would get a bit, but this guy could have decided instead that 0 = no expansion, 1 = MMC5, 2 = FDS, 3 = Sunsoft 5B, etc... and this way nobody could have ever thought of using more than one emulated expansion chip at the same time.<br /><br />I can understand why people would compose in the .nsf format instead of a more sophisticated trackers using &quot;artificial&quot; square/triangle/saw wave samples, but I don't get people that compose specifically for the .nsf format something that could not be made in a famicom cartridge.<br /><br />Also using the NSF format allows to use more than one expansion chip at a time, but it does not allow to use another expansion chip that wasn't ever put in a Famicom cartridge, which would be very possible.

I think the fundamental question comes down to <em>what are we really writing a synthesizer for?</em> Is the NES? The Famicom? Or the NSF format? It seems that using multi-expansion audio or 7-bit sample playback are targeting the NSF format, and not targeting either of the first two. And that's ok. But the people who are still thinking of these things as <em>music for NES games</em> are upset by it because it's not music for NES games. Which ties directly into the followup question of &quot;if you're not keeping faithful to the constraints of what could have fit in a Famicom game, why aren't you using a more capable synth?&quot; (To put it another way: Are you allowed to use the 2MHz 6502 as another instrument, or is this really about the sound generating hardware? Logged formats like .GYM can't have this question.)<br /><br />Tangenting: the ability to set callbacks to a rate other than 50 or 60 Hz is also not exactly all that faithful, but I don't think we gave Neil Baldwin any crap for PR8.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Thu Sep 13, 2012 11:13 pm</p><hr />

I'm just bored with people getting on their high horses, telling me that I do what I love to do for the <em>wrong reasons</em>. I'm not talking about Bregalad specifically here; this isn't a personal attack in any way, just an observation that I've made over the 5-6 years that I've been doing this. For example, there isn't a FamiCompo event where a select few complain about tunes that use expansion chips (sometimes more than one OMGOMGOMG*gasp*) because it's &quot;not meant to be that way&quot;, &quot;that's not what the NES sounded like&quot; and whatnot, and I'm supposed to adhere to those people's view of what my pasttime and passion should be about (or else they'll downvote my tune that I put the same care, passion and effort in as they did their own!). So yes, I get a little pissed off when I respect other people's hobbies and opinions, but I don't get the same treatment in return.<br /><br />Bregalad is 100% entitled to his view that NES or NSF coding should be made with actual programs in mind. I see where he's coming from. But I'll tell you this: the NES system is older than I am; I didn't grow up in that generation of video gaming system. For this reason, the NES holds very little nostalgic significance for me, and I don't get that feeling of &quot;impurity&quot; when I or someone else makes something (a demo, a piece of music or anything along those lines) for it that doesn't reflect the machine's past - that isn't &quot;what the machine was designed to do&quot; - au contraire, I find it brilliant thay they're effectively thinking outside the box, and doing things that weren't intended by design.<br />That's also why I don't find it &quot;weird&quot; to treat the 2A03 (and the Famicom's expansion sound hardware) in much the same way that I would any synthesizer. But in spite of that, I like the idea of sticking to the console's basic limitations, and dislike working in a non-genuine environment like a generic XM/IT tracker with faux-8bit samples. I like the authentic sound of the 2A03 (and the expansion audio). Heck, I like it so much I spent hundreds of dollars to get myself a NTSC NES, a PAL NES, two Famicoms, a Power Pak, a TNS-HFC3 and one copy of every expansion chip to ensure I get as authentic a sound as possible when I play my tunes back. Big deal, you'll say - but that's just to show how passionate I am about Famicom music. And I'm supposed to be doing this for the wrong reasons? What I'm doing is weird, somehow?<br /><br />Look at it this way: NESDev is a community that essentially consists of people who program on a console that's older than I am. Yet I'm the weird one because I use the same machine in different ways by making music for it for the sake of the music itself?<br /><br />Lastly, the thing that got to me is the attitude conveyed by this sentence:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Not the most interesting challenge, huh ?<br /></div><br />This strikes me as both arrogant and pedantic, and that's what grinded my gears in the first place.<br /><br />Besides - if we're going to go down that slippery slope - could one not say that programming for the NES isn't an interesting challenge due to the fact it has an expansion port that you could wire a modern CPU and GPU to and run a modern program? That doesn't really hold water, does it.<br /><br />What I'm trying to say is, I admire and respect every one of you who makes wonderful things with the console; all I ask is a bit of that same respect in return.<br /><br /><em>Bregalad, si tu parles français, je t'invite à exprimer ton opinion en la langue de Molière si cela peut te permettre de mieux transmettre tes idées sans la barrière de langues.</em><br /><br />Anyway try Deflemask it's cool~~<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5260">jrlepage</a> — Thu Sep 13, 2012 10:04 pm</p><hr />

You could just make any music, and make it play on a famicom somehow. Not the most interesting challenge, huh ?<br /><br />When it comes to the NES, it's only limit is that PCM is restricted to 7-bit DAC via $4011. I guess you could just make any music, make a mapper that computes it in a 7-bit value, and have some program doing a lda $wathever sta $4011 loop forever. This is not quite limitating either.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Sep 13, 2012 2:01 am</p><hr />

Here's a clip of multi-expansion being done live on hardware:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLCmxKZ2-o4" class="postlink">Part 1</a><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_m816HUjpQ" class="postlink">Part 2</a><br /><br />The DJ in the video is actually Robokabuto himself. What's more, he used a YMZ-294 instead of a Sunsoft 5B. :p<br /><br />But that's besides the point here. As tokumaru pointed out, basically I treat the NES/Famicom as I would any other synthesizer, really. I don't really care about using my NSFs in games or tech demos; all I'm interested in is making music that pushes a system to its very limit. In my opinion, PCM falls under that description, regardless of whether it's feasible in a game context or not. I think this 'hack' Delek found would be pretty neat, if not for the fact that it's incompatible with most NSF players (including NSFPlay). I haven't tested it on my TNS-HFC3 yet, but I'd wager that it doesn't work, despite reports that it does the Power Pak.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5260">jrlepage</a> — Wed Sep 12, 2012 6:28 pm</p><hr />
