Seconded, it sounds like it's lower pitched, and the higher pitches sound louder. That could be due to aliasing or due to the lower pitch. The lower pitch itself can be caused by lots of things, but I wonder if maybe the period table is missing an entry.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Mon Nov 07, 2016 2:17 am</p><hr />
