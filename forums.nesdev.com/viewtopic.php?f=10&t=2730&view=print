<br />
<br />I'm also having trouble getting my copynes to communicate with my win95 machine.  I've changed my bios option to just bidirectional.  I can't remember whether I've got it working before with this machine or not.  I think the cable I'm using came with an eprom programmer and is longer than the original.  If I want to buy a very short cable, is there anything special I need?  What's the "don't use another cable" disclaimer for?  Is that to make sure I don't use a crossover cable?

<br />PEEOROM is pretty much compatible with PNROM - the cart is just designed to take 'normal' pinout ROMs or EPROMs.
<br />
<br />Which CopyNES client are you using, QBASIC or Win32? If you're using the win32 version, try setting your parallel port to ECP - if it still doesn't work, your onboard parallel port might not be sufficiently compatible. I had the same problem, thus I was forced to buy a PCI parallel port card (which ran at a weird I/O address, but otherwise worked perfectly).

<br />
<br />Strange enough, I was doing fine with the laptop I used to have but now I'm having issues with the winxp comput and the win95 computer I'm now using.  Did you purchase a specific brand pci card?  I plan on buying one for my winxp machine since none of my parallel port items work with it!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I used a NetMos PCI parallel card. It maps to a non-standard port range, but the win32 CopyNES client has an option to override the base address to whatever you need (you can determine it via Device Manager in the 'Resources' tab).
