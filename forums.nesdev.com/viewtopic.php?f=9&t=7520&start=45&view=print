		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I bought the dealextreme cable for $4 something, mounted the Nokia-connector end directly in the NES-connector so I didn't get any "fugly" joint mid-cable. 
<br />
<br />Mine had these colors and designations:
<br />Blue: Rx
<br />White: GND
<br />Green: Tx
<br />
<br />It was quite easy to bend the halves of the connector shell apart to check which color was what. I use a USB extension cord with mine, worked on the first try.
<br />
<br />Great to be able to do this, guess I should start developing something for the NES now.
<br />
<br />Should be possible to mount the dealextreme-cable with a really short cable or maybe skip the cable and glue the NES-connector and USB-shell together into a little adapter that you hook a USB extension cable to. Should be possible to make it pretty small if you want to.
<br />
<br />If you don't have a connector that fits perhaps a plain 3.5mm stereo audio female connector could be mounted on the NES - or maybe through a hole in the bottom part. Then solder wires between that and the motherboard and use a plain 3.5mm stereo male plug on the dealextreme-cable end - or whatever cable you have. No need to butcher a controller if you don't have one to spare. 
<br />
<br />Thanks!

<br />Ran into some problems here when using the Original Nintendo Wireless IR equipment "NES Satellite".
<br />
<br />It's really hard getting past the intro screen "Waiting for data from PC..." when using a NES Satellite, don't know why exactly, have to press a whole lot of buttons to get past it and then the rest of the menu works as usual.
<br />
<br />Perhaps the key press detection is waiting for too long presses or something? When controller is hooked directly there's never a problem. This goes for both European and US machine.

<br />That's strange. I guess it gets confused somehow by the code that checks the 2nd port to see if there's serial data coming (this code was written by blargg). I don't know why that would mess up the 1st controller reads though.

<br />Perhaps just display on screen what the ports are reading, what was pushed last and for how long it was held? Something like that.

<br />I don't have a PowerPak so I can't test if it really works for this, but I've used for other stuff (accessing serial console on a ADSL modem) and it works perfectly.

<br />The page only has instructions for how to send the .bin file from command line on Linux, but it's possible to do that on Windows too. (I don't remember the exact details, but I'm pretty sure it can be done using the COPY command with COM3/whatever as destination, after the transfer parameters are set with some other command).

And did you have to do any fiddling to get them working?<br /><br />According to the short Engrish documentation in &quot;CA-45&amp;CA-50\Nok 5000\Read me.txt&quot;,  &quot;USB Driver\USB Driver Installer.exe&quot; is the installation program to run. There's also &quot;CA-45&amp;CA-50\Nok 5000\USB Driver\Win Vista  Driver Installer.exe&quot;. Both of them result in windows letting me know that &quot;Device driver was not successfully installed&quot;, and the ugly old exlamation mark in device manager. Error code i either 10 or 37 depending on which of the drivers mentioned above I try to I install.<br /><br />I am using Windows 7 starter on a Samsung N220 netbook.
