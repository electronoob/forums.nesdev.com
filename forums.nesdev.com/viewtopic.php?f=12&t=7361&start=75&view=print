I was surprised at how fast it was delivered, I'm used to waiting 2-3 months for things I order abroad, but this came in less than a month! And directly to my home too, which means no abusive taxes! Yey! It was the exact opposite with the PowerPak.<br /><br />Anyway, I'll be playing with it later tonight, do you guys have any tips on how to deal with the thing? I haven't done anything yet, I didn't even download anything, so I figured I'd just ask if you guys have any advice on setting it up.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The position of the LEDs is indeed don't play well with the US cases. For now I'll just keep them hidden. Yours looks great!<br /><br />My label-making skills aren't that great either... I couldn't find a place that would print on glossy sticker paper, so I went with the non-glossy one and used paper varnish to make it glossy, but it made the brighter parts of my Everdrive label a bit transparent, and since the Genesis cartridge case is black it ended up darkening certain spots on the label.<br /><br />I printed 3 copies of each label though (Mega Everdrive and SD2SNES), so now I'm trying a different kind of varnish... The one I used previously is a liquid you apply with a brush, and this one comes in a spray can. From my tests it doesn't look as glossy, but if it protects the label without making it transparent I guess it's OK.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />While that's true, over 90% of SNES games use no special hardware. Only a small minority does. The only truly unaccessible game that could be supported is Star Fox 2 which was never released. But it's not that hard to make a hacked cart with it. Also technically one of the ST chips I think ikari said wouldn't be doable, something about hardware limitations. I think what most people want to see is Super FX and SA-1 supported. Those were the most prevalent chips after DSP1 I believe. I'm sure SDD-1 should come along eventually. But we're still talking about only a handful of games. Obviously notable ones like Kirby's Dreamland 3, Kirby Super Star, Mega Man X2/X3, Super Mario RPG. Though I do understand that people from certain parts of the world have alot harder time getting access to those games so support in the cartridge would be a big deal.

I really like the Kirby games (and the Mega Man games too, but not as much <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />), but whenever I find one of them for sale they cost US$40 or even more. Sometimes there'll be a beaten up cart with a nasty label that costs less, but there's no fun in collect that. I don't know why, but SNES carts are ridiculously pricey around here, much more than Genesis/MD ones, so it makes sense to buy an SD2SNES instead of 4 or 5 of these expensive games.

ROM loading is lightning-fast, even 32 Mbit games start almost instantly. There's a real time clock built in, which (apart from adding support for more games) makes it easier to synchronize SRM files. BTW, the hardware looks more &quot;real&quot; and professional than any other unofficial/third-party SNES accessory I'm aware of, right down to the exact shape and color of the PCB and edge connector.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.manuloewe.de/snestuff/sd2snes_no100.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Plus, the original creator is still actively developing the firmware, which I guess is worth noting. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Anyway, I'll be playing with it later tonight, do you guys have any tips on how to deal with the thing?
