<br />I wouldn't be surprised. The first season of <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</em> was based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%8Dry%C5%AB_Sentai_Zyuranger" class="postlink"><em>Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger</em> TV series</a>. But where did they get the 2? It seems to me that a game called <em>Power Rangers 2</em> would be an adaptation of <em>Gosei Sentai Dairanger</em>, the series on which the second season of <em>MMPR</em> was based.

<br />I wish they had one Sentai game per year like happens with the series. The NES would have seen some interesting games. I didn't like the Zyuranger one much, but the Jetman game is kinda nice. A Dairanger game would probably be interesting, but then again the NES was already starting to die by that time.

<br />Interesting, I've never seen that version of the name (with Ookami in it), just alternate spellings of Chou Jinrou Senki.
<br />
<br />Btw, the Japanese and US versions are different. There are two different tracks and different dpcm samples for the tom. I put the complete soundtrack up <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=B3A2207DEAC09166" class="postlink">here</a>, so you can see which tracks belong to which. I used the US version by default as I like its tom sample more, and distinguished which two were unique to the JP version.

<br />A semitone up and 20 percent higher BPM? Sounds like PAL music being played in NTSC mode. Does it work when you put your NSF player into PAL mode?

<br />
<br />In nezplay (standalone), the information display labels it as an NTSC nsf and plays it as such.  I don't see an option to change that, but it recognizes other PAL nsfs as being PAL, and plays those correctly. 
<br />
<br />In notsofatso, I can enable a "Force PAL" option, but it does nothing! And it plays other PAL nsfs correctly, so I wouldn't think I should have to mess with that.
<br />
<br />So while it may just be an issue of it being played back at NTSC, it seems like something that still needs fixing with the nsf itself. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br /><strong>A couple of random things</strong>
<br />
<br />Something I noticed during playing Night Arrow, I have a Galaxian NSF, but I've never heard any of the tracks in-game. Granted I've never gotten too far in the game but still, do I have the wrong file or is there a correct rip at all?
<br />
<br />Nuts &amp; Milk seems to have a weird rip, track 4 sounds glitchy and the rip is missing a track (one of the stage BGMs).
<br />
<br />I also noticed that in a multicart (8-in-1 Supergame (KY8002) [p1]) , game 6, Pocket World / Pocket Maero (Super Mario Bros. pirate) seemed to contain altered music and sounds.
<br />
<br />Whew.

I don't see an option to change that, but it recognizes other PAL nsfs as being PAL, and plays those correctly. <br /><br />In notsofatso, I can enable a "Force PAL" option, but it does nothing! And it plays other PAL nsfs correctly, so I wouldn't think I should have to mess with that.<br /><br />So while it may just be an issue of it being played back at NTSC, it seems like something that still needs fixing with the nsf itself. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>
<br />
<br />As speculated, it was a PAL version of the music being played back as NTSC. Not sure how the NSF came about, I just downloaded it off the net.
<br />
<br />I no longer have the source code to that project but I trawled through the game source code and there were two binary files for the music. Turns out one was PAL and the other NTSC. I stuck a NSF header on it and copied the (rather clumsy) hack from the old NSF and so now a fixed version is up on my website (just replaced the incorrect versions of the files).
