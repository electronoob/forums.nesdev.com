gunshotsamplechange1.jpg<br />I opened the gunshot mp3 file in Audacity and used a graphic equalizer in the Effect section to raise the frequencies above 400 and decrease the frequencies below 400 with the 400 band in the middle.  I also deleted the lead and did a very short fade in in the Effect section to remove any clip and also a fade out on the end fourth of the sample.  The original sample had some low mid frequencies so this processing should remove some of that and amplify the higher end to cut through the sound mix a little. <br /><br />gunshotchange1.bin<br />The new sample is not much different from the original after importing into Famitracker.  They both sound good in their own way to me.<br /> <br />gunshotsampleandnoise.jpg<br />I think to get that high end burst you should layer the sample with noise if you can.  Here, I added high noise for the initial attack 8-#.  Then, mid high for pop 5-#.  The tail is low for the fade 4-# &amp; 2-#.<br /><br />I tinkered a little with the clip sound but it didn't affect it much.  Thanks for uploading the sounds.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9134">cdigi</a> — Sat Apr 28, 2018 10:47 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Sogona wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I've recently done an overhaul on my sound engine by incorporating the DMC channel into it. The samples I currently have, a gunshot sound effect and an &quot;empty clip&quot; sound effect, sound okay on their own, at least as good as I feel they can sound for 1-bit DPCM (They use the highest sample rate), but when I put them in with the rest of the game, they always seem to be drowned out by the rest of the channels. When I compare it to other games' samples, especially those from sample-heavy games like Konami and Sunsoft games, theirs just seem a lot richer and louder overall. I guess I am currently just using the DMC channel as a glorified noise channel, so it kinda gets drowned out by the actual noise channel.<br /><br />Basically I'm just wondering if there's any auditory techniques or anything that can be done to make samples sound as good as they can; not fidelity-wise, but more volume-balance-wise. I know this is kind of a vague question, and I can elaborate better if need be.<br /></div><br /><br />The other suggestions and ideas in this thread are great.  It may work to equalize and then compress the sounds at a mid high frequency and then amplify the sound to their maximum volume.  I would be interested to look at your samples in Audacity if you would like to post them.  Another thing that may work would be to layer the sample sounds with a burst of noise to give them more high frequency pop and volume to the effect.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9134">cdigi</a> — Fri Apr 27, 2018 5:43 pm</p><hr />

Another thing to watch out for is where the delta counter is during your sample's playback.  If your sample isn't loud enough to reset the &quot;midpoint&quot; of the sample, this can be a thing (and even if it IS loud enough, you can tilt the data toward zero with RJDMC and FamiTracker).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=34">RushJet1</a> — Fri Apr 27, 2018 12:56 pm</p><hr />

With a pitch shift up and a low output samplerate, you eventually start to push harmonic content outside the window if you go high enough = aliasing and low pass filtering. Of course, if you go low enough with the sample rate only, you get the same result. <br /><br />It is better (more controlled) to condition the sample with EQ:s / filters beforehand, at any rate.<br /><br />I agree setting just setting the sample rate is more straightforward. I just got used to a method where a sample in audacity is shifted by the count of semitones, and then account for that later.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Thu Apr 26, 2018 9:25 am</p><hr />

Three tips:<br />1) I don’t know about best, but you can get them smaller and reduce hi-frequency noise at the same time by speeding the clip up to a higher pitch, save, import, then play it back in your sound engine at a slower speed (ultimately this means fewer samples per second and as a result a treble roll-off). This might even suffice as a good enough lowpass filter instead of hardcoded filtering, if you’re lucky, but check case-for-case.<br /><br />Castlevania 3 does this. You’ll notice that the grunting noise, the tom, and the thunder is higher in pitch when played back neutrally.<br /><br />2) Low bitdepth is in an unhappy marriage with dynamic content. Abrupt volume changes result in noise. Try to keep the body of your samples flat, with the help of a limiter, compressor or compander plugin (compressor + expander).<br /><br />3) Really low frequencies take more energy to push than higher frequencies. If dynamic depth is limited (which it is), you may get better results by filtering out the lowest frequencies, so that they don’t suppress more important frequencies.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Thu Apr 26, 2018 12:32 am</p><hr />
