		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Let me make something crystal clear: FCEUX is not LGPL.  It's GPL v2.0.  The COPYING file that comes with the FCEUX 2.2.0 source code is for GPL v2.0.  Here are the differences:<br /><br />GPL v2.0: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt</a><!-- m --><br />LGPL v2.0: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.0.txt">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.0.txt</a><!-- m --><br />LGPL v2.1: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.txt">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.txt</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Note in GPL v2.0 the header says &quot;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&quot;.<br />Note in LGPL v2.0 the header says &quot;GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&quot;.<br />Note in LGPL v2.1 the header says &quot;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&quot;.<br /><br />So make sure you understand the difference between these 3 licenses.  <strong>They are indeed quite different</strong>.  They're so horribly atrocious that there's a 5000 page long FAQ addressing all the nonsense (if English isn't your first language you're in trouble):<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-license ... 0-faq.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Also, I just found out that FCEUX is in violation of <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/license-lgpl.php" class="postlink">the SDL 1.2 license</a>, which is LGPL v2.1.  I should probably bring this to the attention of the SDL folks.  The violations:<br /><br />1. FCEUX does not give &quot;prominent notice&quot; that SDL is used in any way.  There is no mention of it in the Help -&gt; About dialog, nor is it mentioned in the .chm help document.  Use of SDL 1.2 needs to be mentioned in Help -&gt; About.<br /><br />2. FCEUX in its binary form does not provide a copy of the SDL 1.2 (LGPL 2.1) license.  The actual license itself has to be provided in full (i.e. you cannot just including the license file in fceux-2.2.0-win32.zip) -- you have to provide the license itself within the binary and make it visible (i.e. via Help -&gt; About).  You CANNOT provide a link to the license either -- you must actually provide a full copy of the license, and this is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html#WhyMustIInclude" class="postlink">covered here</a>.<br /><br />And FCEUX is also in violation of the GPL 2.0 license as well:<br /><br />1. FCEUX in its binary form does not mention that itself is under the GPL v2.0 license (this should also be in the Help -&gt; About dialog), nor in binary form does it provide a copy of this license.  The license *is* provided in the source tarball, but that is not sufficient -- you have to provide an actual copy of the entire license.<br /><br />As for BASS.NET -- you should be able to use this library/framework in anything you want, and however you want, <strong>unless you plan on selling the program</strong>.  The <a href="http://www.un4seen.com/bass.html#license" class="postlink">BASS.NET license</a> says it's free for non-commecial use, and they don't provide any other details other than that.  So I'm inclined to believe free means free, as in &quot;do whatever you want&quot;.  You don't have to provide source to BASS.NET with your program either.<br /><br />If you did plan on selling your program (i.e. a modified FCEUX + SDL), that would be fine (if I understand the licenses correctly), but you would still have to make the full source code your program (i.e. FCEUX and SDL and any modifications you performed) available to the public.  I don't know about the legality aspect of using BASS.NET in combination with this, because the last paragraph of their license section is a bit vague as to whether or not this would be permitted.  You'd have to talk to them.

You Subject line says BASS, your post says BASS.NET.<br /><br />The licenses for these two things are quite different.<br /><br />If BASS -- you can do whatever you want, as long as you're not selling the software.  You'll still need to provide full source code for your modified FCEUX / SDL bits (i.e. complying with GPL v2.0 and LGPL v2.1).<br /><br />If BASS.NET -- you can only distribute the BASS.NET DLL (called Bass.Net.dll).  <a href="http://bass.radio42.com/bass_lic_freeware.html" class="postlink">Their own license</a> says this (read the numeric items).  You'll still need to provide full source code for your modified FCEUX / SDL bits (i.e. complying with GPL v2.0 and LGPL v2.1) but the only part of BASS.NET you can include is the Bass.net.dll file.<br /><br />I doubt anyone will use this software, by the way, unless you get a <a href="http://bass.radio42.com/bass_register.html" class="postlink">Freeware Registration Key</a>:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><ul><li>A splash screen will appear every time at start-up (unless you obtained a valid Registration-Key).</li></ul></div><br />Otherwise I doubt anyone will use an emulator that has some mandatory splash screen every time they launch it.  Annoyance level = too high.<br /><br />I don't really have an opinion on the BASS.NET stuff, but as for the GPL/LGPL stuff, crap like this is exactly why I hate those licenses.  They're viral in nature.  This is why what little software I do release uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#2-clause_license_.28.22Simplified_BSD_License.22_or_.22FreeBSD_License.22.29" class="postlink">2-clause BSD license</a>, because it's more or less akin to &quot;<a href="http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/" class="postlink">do whatever the fuck you want</a>, just be sure to keep this copyright/license notice in the source file&quot;.

It seems a bit odd for a multi-platform program to use SDL for non-Windows and DX or something else for Windows, don't you think?  I.e. what's the point in using SDL if you're just going to do it all manually?  :P  I would have to sit down and look at the source to see if it's used.<br /><br />Regarding the GPL specifics (not pertaining to SDL): they're still in violation of that regardless.

The widgets in the debugger are built around traditional Win32 widgets, it appears, not custom widgets running in an SDL surface. The debugging front-end has had sound problems under Wine, and I ended up running it with the sound off.

If they upgraded to SDL 2.0, only the SDL violations I listed would become moot.  The GPL violations would still exist.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">In order to change to a license other than GPL, they'd have to get all contributors to agree to an exception for linking against BASS.</div><br />FCEUX could change to any other license if they wanted but they'd have to release a new version under that license (i.e. they can't go and change the license used in already-publicly-released versions), and they'd have to get permissions from <strong>all</strong> contributors who contributed code to FCEUX to switch to whatever license.  TL;DR -- you can absolutely switch away from the GPL at any time if you wish but you have to get permission to use the code written by each of the contributors (i.e. if the project has had 12 contributors, and 8 agree to switch to another license but 4 do not, the license can be switched but the code written by those 4 has to be removed or rewritten).  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1409666/switching-licence-from-gpl-to-bsd-in-later-time" class="postlink">Reference</a> (be sure to see the first response to the top comment; Laurence Gonsalves' point is mentioned further down in a reply to a separate comment)<br /><br />Linking to BASS has no bearing WRT switching away from the GPL -- the BASS license is pretty much non-existent (<a href="http://www.un4seen.com/" class="postlink">scroll down to Licensing</a>).  Instead their license is: &quot;if you use BASS in something that's for commercial purposes you need to buy a license from us&quot;.  FCEUX isn't commercial.  Of course I have no idea how BASS does their implementation (e.g. is it a DLL you include, do they give you the entire source, etc.).<br /><br />Linking to BASS.NET also has no bearing WRT switching away from the GPL -- they could still keep releasing FCEUX with BASS.NET (free version) as long as their method of inclusion was including the Bass.Net.DLL file with both the binary and source releases.  GPL v2.1 <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html#FSWithNFLibs" class="postlink">covers/permits this here</a>, although somewhat sketchy (e.g. do you really need BASS.NET when another audio library with a more GPL-friendly license could be used or you could write the code yourself?).  For the commercial license of BASS.NET used with FCEUX it's a different story -- <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html#GPLIncompatibleLibs" class="postlink">this then applies</a>, re: having to make an exception, and there's no point in going down that road anyway.<br /><br />Every time I have to go digging through the GPL (and licensing shit in general, but mainly with the GPL), the more I cry inside.  As I told someone here on the forum privately (who was asking me about licensing in their own software): I appreciate what the FSF and Stallman is trying to do, meaning the concept/belief, but I just don't think it's pragmatic or reasonable -- more specifically I don't like having to comply with someone else's belief system when it comes to my software.  That's why I use other licenses.  But some people have the same belief as Stallman, and that's fine -- I just don't think it's entirely &quot;reasonable&quot; (not sure how else to phrase it).
