With that said, I wouldn't be against anyone wanting to make a cart for themself.<br /><br />Please let me know if you have any questions. You can PM me, but I'd like to have a public discussion of this first.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I guess I am somewhat of a slow programmer, but I'm finding this 6-hour estimate to be terribly optimistic! Even the most basic of the games requires a good framework to handle game modes, screen transitions, VRAM updates and the like. Unless you already have a generic framework ready you can immediately develop a game on top of, you'll spend at least a few hours on that before you can even get started on the game itself. Unless you plan on hacking the game away screen by screen without a proper foundation, which I definitely don't recommend.<br /><br />If I was coding this, I definitely couldn't come up with anything in less than 3 workdays or so, but if probably need more than that to fix bugs, polish things up, and organize the code.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I actually recently had to create a basic NES framework. I feel like six hours isn't a bad estimate for a rough pass, but probably not for a finished thing. That said, I'd probably not really charge much of anything over that even for the finished thing just because it'd be interesting to make some money doing this. But I'm currently working on another project, hopefully done relatively soon. If nothing happens before that's out, I guess I'll drop a quote too.

(Something about 48-hour Game Jams, and lack of efficiency was mentioned.)<br /><br />...Not sure if that game is going to be published.
