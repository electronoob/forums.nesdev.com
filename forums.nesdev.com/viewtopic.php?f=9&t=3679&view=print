		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well if you saw my other post i couldn't get Eb cart working when i soldered the eproms directly to the board (even though it was a mess)
<br />But i cut them off and put them in a socket cart i made and it all worked..
<br />
<br />So seeing as i had a working one in front of me i tried to make another one without sockets..  I was super careful and the soldering was probably the best ive done And it didn't work  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /> 
<br />
<br />So i desoldered the eproms and soldered some sockets in, then stuck the eproms straight back in and it worked...
<br />
<br />Is it possible my eproms wont work unless there in sockets???
<br />
<br />
<br />Also if do use sockets does anyone have and tricks to get it back in the case without cutting it?

<br />
<br />Naah it's not that.  The resistance will be in the milliohms range.  It's most likely some stealth shorts... like between the chip pin that is lifted up and the hole underneath or similar.  That or there might be some kind of wiring flaw too that happens to be corrected when it's socketed.

<br />
<br />I think you're talking single digit resistance (in ohms) added by a socket, that doesn't seem likely to add any kind of benefit does it?  You really need to get up to 5K or more before you're going to notice any real difference in behavior.
<br />I think your other suggestion, that getting a good pin lift is easier with a socket, is much more likely.  Or, a bad solder job.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />in his last thread he said he tryed a differint game and it worked but them he went back to earthbound witchout sockets then trouble
<br />
<br />Did you try EB0 in the socketed one and have it working?
<br />
<br />if not my advice is the same as in the last thread
<br />
<br />if you did it would seem ether
<br />1 you left the eprom wimdow exposed and it got UVifyed
<br />2. bad or incorrect soldering
<br />
<br />
<br />note: I have made a direct solder eb0 cart witch worked but I used flashroms not that is matters

<br />
<br />and im 110% its not the soldering it all looks really good. ( i can see my reflection in every joint)
<br />
<br />The eprom is made by ST  and is M27C2001
<br />
<br />does any body have any neat ''tricks'' to get a socketed eprom inside the cart without wiring each eprom pin individually to the socket?

<br />
<br />Tepples suggestion worked with my devcart, i used Atmel flash ROMs and they refused to work until i fitted 470 ohm resistors to PRG D0-7
<br />
<br />Someone may have suggested this already, but you could use ohm meter to check all connections, and don't use beeper range it often gives a misleading results.
