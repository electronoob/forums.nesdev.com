A few games that I've tried seem to be working, but I want response to be as similar as possible to how it was on real hardware.  I tried zapruder, but the docs for it don't seem to give any indication of how hardware <em>should</em> respond.<br /></div>Here's some numbers I pulled out from manually playing with a white LED, microcontroller, disassembled zapper, and oscilloscope:<br />- The notional period of a scanline inside the zapper is determined by an RC time constant, so can vary by up to 20% as a function of the parts used. Mine, however, does seem to be tuned to 16kHz to the precision that I can measure.<br />- The frequency selectiveness of the zapper is really lousy, barely providing 3dB of rejection within the adjacent decade of frequencies<br />- After the output has fired and no light is falling on the photodiode, the output will go false again after approximately 600-800µs.<br />- A single sufficiently bright light pulse (measured in terms of total amount of photocurrent, i.e. charge) will cause the light detect output to go true exactly three scanlines later.<br />- A single dimmer light pulse will still cause the output to go true, but it will randomly vary anywhere between four to sixteen scanlines later<br />- I was unable to usefully determine what the lower threshold for light detection was<br />- Periodic input will decrease the delay of the latter case: one of the pins of the IR3T07A rises in a tilted triangle wave (slow rise, fast fall, rising more than falling) after it's been triggered. Light input while the pin is rising causes it to rise faster; light input while the pin is falling has no effect.<br />- The final output (as seen by the NES) is a hysteretic buffer from the analog signal mentioned in the previous point, which is then inverted twice more before it is seen by the CPU.<br /><br />The minimum trigger time is exactly determined by the 10kΩ pullup inside the NES and the 10µF capacitor inside the zapper.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Wed Apr 16, 2014 12:45 pm</p><hr />

And in BALL TARGET, with a radius of 4 and bright 5 hue 0, HT ranged from 0 to 21 depending on how well the barrel was centered over the ball in the middle. This indicates that it's integrating light over a circle. I could acquire targets with HT=15 down to radius 1.<br /><br />X coordinates in X AND Y COORDS seem to vary randomly, frame to frame, in a range 6 units wide (each unit is 18 pixels) with less probability at the sides. This variability is why I ended up rejecting the XY zapkernel from production use.<br /><br />Vertical lines, bright 5, hue 0:<br />0-9 20-23 22-24 23-24<br />24-25 26-27 26-27 26-27<br />18-19 23-24 25-26 22-23<br /><br />Horiz. lines, bright 5, hue 0:<br />16-23 19-25 20-26 20-26<br />24-26 25-27 26-27 25-26<br />20-23 24-26 25-26 24-25<br />For this test pattern, the Y coordinate appears to jump over areas that are black.<br /><br />Trigger time<br />Pulling the trigger produces a &quot;click&quot; as the switch turns on and then a &quot;clank&quot; as it turns back off. Held time counts from the &quot;click&quot; to the &quot;clank&quot;. It's usually 5 for a normal pull, can't get it lower than 4, may be some capacitor extending the pulse from click to clank. Games may interpret a long press (hold at &quot;click&quot; for more than 15 frames) differently from a short press (click through to clank). For example, Music Toy: Axe treats a short press as a long-term timbre change and a long press as a single note accent.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Apr 16, 2014 11:35 am</p><hr />

Just as with <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Overscan#Statistics" class="postlink">overscan amounts</a>, different TVs at different settings produce different results in <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=8108" class="postlink">Zap Ruder</a>. If you have an NES, a Zapper, and a CRT SDTV, contribute your results for different hue/bright levels and different line patterns here. I may give numbers from my Magnavox TV later tonight.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Apr 16, 2014 8:23 am</p><hr />
