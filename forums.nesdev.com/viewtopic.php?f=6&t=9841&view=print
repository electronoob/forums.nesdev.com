It works by decomposing a signal into a sum of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function" class="postlink">Heaviside steps</a>, low-pass filtering a single representative step, sampling that filtered step at various fractions of an output sample, and adding up all the steps.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The NES is actually generating audio at ~1.79MHz (that's megahertz, not kilohertz).  Any other sample rate will be a resampled version of that.<br />If you use nearest-neighbor resampling, it sounds awful.  Using linear interpolation doesn't sound too bad, but is still somewhat distorted.  Bandlimited interpolation (what Blargg is doing) works best.<br />Blip-buffer also uses a clever programming trick to make the sound synthesis run really fast, it stores the wave as volume differences instead of volume levels, then converts back to volume levels before you play it.

The Solstice intro, for example, is a good test-case for filtering out too-high frequencies.<br /><br />I'm emulating the sound channels at 1.79MHz, low-pass filtering with a 512-tap FIR filter, and downsampling by 37 to get ~48kHz output.  I suppose I haven't compared with a critical ear, but I don't notice any particularly scratchy differences between this method and the blipbuf method that I <s>currently</s> previously used.<br /><br />(Note that I'm not trying to say that my method is better; it's certainly not from a CPU utilization perspective.  I don't understand the blipbuf method well enough to re-implement it, and my goal was to build something sans copy-paste code/libraries).<br /><br />edit: typo
