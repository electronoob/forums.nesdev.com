		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When did this meme start? Considering my familiarity with old PC hardware, why do some people pretend that computers were always super imba master race gaming machines?
<br />
<br />Let's see:
<br />
<br />NES was better for gaming than the 80s IBM PC (which was weak in gaming even compared to ZX Spectrum) and pretty much every 8-bit computer.
<br />
<br />SNES and Genesis had graphical effects and games that beat every computer except for the Amiga for a long time.
<br />
<br />PS1 came out in 1994, and titles were still developed for it in mid-2000s. Find me a 1994 PC game that had graphics and sounds as good as PSX game. You are gonna find VGA games with hideously blocky sprites and raycasting. Polygons? Forgot about it. PS1 had hardware acceleration half a decade before it really became mainstream on PCs (Voodoo graphics on PC was much better, but almost every PC in the heyday of PS1 had crappy S3 cards). Hell, the Sega Saturn and 3DO that both came out before the PSX had 3D acceleration. 
<br />
<br />PS2 from 2000 is capable of playing GTA San Andreas and  Need for Speed: Underground 2. Would an average 2000 PC even run these games playably? Probably not.
<br />
<br />It is only the most recent generation of consoles that are more or less tie or even inferior to PCs in gaming. PCs can do many more tasks than just games but many PC gamers try to pretend that console games are inferior to PC ones. 
<br />
<br />And don't call me a "console fanboy", I have never owned a console in my life due to my disability (my crippled hands are way better suited to keyboard control), but I've seen enough of games on consoles of my friends and played enough of them in emulators to see that say, an average 1994 hardware PC game is very much technologically inferior to a PSX game. The gap is much bigger when comparing NES vs. pre-VGA PCs:

<br />
<br />So what's the PC fetish all about? Hell, some people even think that the PC was always a gaming platform, even through up until 1990 nobody would even think of buying a PC for gaming because most of the games were worse than budget ZX spectrum tape games and the system lacked any raster control or sprites or even attributes whatsover.
<br />
<br />I even saw 1 person claim that every console game is on the PC in much higher quality. Does anyone have Crash Bendicoot for DOS? Oh no, because it would be a raycasted FPS with no ability to look down or up and it would lag on then "high end" 486s. Or maybe it would be like Quake, with software rendered early 3DO quality textures.

<br />
<br />Well, yes.  But SNES had a 3.58 Mhz 65c816 based processor and did Wolfenstein 3D without Super FX chips. And after SNES, consoles had the edge in 3D acceleration (Voodoo on the PC was much better than the PSX 3D acceleration HW, but came later and was non-standard).
<br />
<br />And by the time of Doom 3DO and Sega Saturn were already out, being both capable of far better graphics than Doom (although their Doom ports were terrible because of lazy development). A while later came PS1, which had an enhanced version of Doom. Et cetera...
<br />
<br />Also, SNES came out in 1990 in Japan. A typical 1990 PC is a beepy 286 EGA box, well, 286 if you are lucky, 8088/8086 if you are not.
<br />
<br />Anyways I am not a console fan against PCs, just tired of the "PCs were always better" bullcrap. Until 1995, Amiga was the best of both worlds in my opinion - a multimedia computer utilizing some "consolish" technology (2D acceleration cca 7 years before first accelerator cards for the PC even appeared) while being a full-fledged computer.
<br />
<br />And it would be a miracle if the Doom run on SNES vanilla, because on PC it needs at least a 40 Mhz 386. The 65c816 has a far better Mhz/performance ratio (the 3.58 mhz 65c816 is approximately equivalent to a 286) but it is still a primitive 16-bit CPU with a 8-bit bus going against a 32-bit powerhouse. And it still beats the DOS 386 PC in most 2D and mode 7 (DOS PCs don't have mode 7 at all) games.

<br />
<br />...and it would've had an even better Mhz/performance ratio, if only developers didn't intentionally sabatoge their SNES games for the sole purpose of marketing the Genesis version to an older "hardcore gamer" audience, and marketing the SNES version to a "kiddy" audience, who wanted easier slower paced games.
<br />
<br />That's the one thing about buying gaming hardware. (both PC and video game systems)  System specs don't mean shit when stupid marketing politics get in the way of what kind of games they make on the system.  
<br />
<br />The SNES could've used a 500 khz Z80, and there wouldn't have been a difference.

<br />
<br />You can't say average PC because Consoles are not average either. They are very specialized hardware. PCs have had advantages over consoles for a long time. Consoles likewise have their own advantages over PCs. 
<br />
<br />You can certainly find a 2000 era PC CPU and GPU that would play those games fine. I'm not sure where you are getting this. Each platform has its strengths and weaknesses.

<br />That has two reasons. First, the PS3 OS is much lighter weight than Windows. (I'm told the Xbox 360 OS is even lighter than that.) It'd be possible to make a stripped-down game operating system for PCs (see Windows Embedded), but PC gamers have an ingrained expectation that a game will be able to multitask with other applications running on the same PC. Second, consoles allow constructing display lists and textures directly in the GPU's preferred format instead of in an architecture-independent format that the driver must translate to the GPU's format.

<br />
<br />And the fact that the PS3 version of skyrim does suck because when the "objects file" gets so big, the PS3's architecture breaks with how the Skyrim version for PS3 works and then drops to about 1 frame per minute of out nowhere with only one solution: delete your game. And best of all bethseda promised it won't ever be fixed. This problem doesn't exist on 360 or PC at all, so IMO that's a huge and valid reason for it "sucking." I have also heard both consoles have texture loading problems, oh well.
