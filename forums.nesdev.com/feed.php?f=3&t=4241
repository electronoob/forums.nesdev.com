I hope your kid's getting better, but thank you for taking the pictures anyway; they're good enough for me.  :)  I don't think your TV, at default settings, doesn't do any yellow boost at all; any over-yellowishness is probably something that's different between individual TV sets, so I guess it probably is a myth.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3329">strangenesfreak</a> — Wed Oct 22, 2008 12:53 pm</p><hr />

The building are yellowish. The enemies a little bit.<br /><br /><br />I still have the originals pictures. At 2 megs each, I couldn't put them online and I don't think my ISP would like it since I put them on my personal page.<br /><br />I had to do them very fast, the battery of the digital camera was dying. I don't know how long I will be able to keep them online.<br /><br />But my setting was very improvised.  Dark room to avoid light, basic digital camera, my hand where shaking even on a chair+box so it was not the ideal setting.  <br /><br />The settings of the TV are all reset to zero, except for one called "unicolor" in japanese. If you increase it, it boots the color. In that case, the yellowish tone becomes more obvious but it must be because the colors becomes over saturated.<br /><br />I hope these pictures will help you.  I can take more someday if I can find the time to do it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Wed Oct 22, 2008 7:37 am</p><hr />

I wanted to do it but my kid is sick and we had to go to the hospital in the middle of the night.  Once things get back to normal, I should be able to take the pictures. <br /><br />If I have a chance, I will try to get the model # tonight once I return from work.<br /><br />Edit: <br /><br />I just came back and I had a chance to check the model. It's a 1997 Toshiba 21R77.  This is the only information on the back for the model number. No specific series or anything.

Banshaku, have you been able to take the pictures yet?  If for some reason you're not able to, then maybe you could just tell what the model number of your TV is, and that could be looked up to see if it does any yellow boost or oversaturation.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3329">strangenesfreak</a> — Tue Oct 21, 2008 1:25 pm</p><hr />

This is a good starting list.  Once I have a chance (i.e. my kid is sleeping..), I will try to take some pictures of them.<br /><br />But I do remember that some of them did seems more yellowish than what I remembered when I had them on my original nes.  I will try to reset the settings of the tv just to make sure that it doesn't compromise the tests, but I guess we never changed them once we received it so it should be in it's normal position already.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Sat Oct 18, 2008 6:09 pm</p><hr />

I did PM _Zaphod_ if he had any of those TVs, and he said he didn't.  Yeah, I could see how oversaturation could produce an illusion of this yellow boost...could it be that Japanese TVs are simply set to be more saturated than American TVs?  I personally think that might be the case, because yellow does "boost" if you increase saturation in Nestopia.  Naturally, since the yellowish hues are generally the most saturated hues in the NES, a saturation increase would be noticable on the brighter colors of yellowish hues, which are 7 and 8 in the NES under normal emphasis settings.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3329">strangenesfreak</a> — Mon Oct 13, 2008 8:21 am</p><hr />

According to _Zaphod_, on certain Japanese TVs, yellow colors look like they are indeed boosted; he cited Fire Mario's bright-yellow clothes as an example:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=38359#38359" class="postlink">_Zaphod</a> wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Many games were developed for consumer Ntsc on the NEs/Famicom.<br /><br />WHat this means is that many games orginally developed in japan were made for a yellow boosted palette, which was common on JP tvs at the time...<br /><br />On a JP consumer TV, fire mario wears yellow clothes instead of white. Ths is replicated in the arcade version. ON US tvs, he wears white instead. Luigi wears white on either, though.<br /></div><br />Maybe _Zaphod_, if he has one of these JP consumer TVs, could tell us the model of that TV to see for sure if JP TVs indeed boost yellow or not.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3329">strangenesfreak</a> — Sun Oct 12, 2008 2:58 pm</p><hr />
