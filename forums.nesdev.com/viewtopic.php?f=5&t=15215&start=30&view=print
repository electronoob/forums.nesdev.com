Until very recently, handheld consoles sold in North American stores weren't very open to small home-based businesses. So smaller developers receiving a letter of rejection from Nintendo have <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=14508" class="postlink">had to settle for mobile</a>. It led to a situation like this:<br /><br /><ul><li>Android: <span style="text-decoration: underline">Buy now on Google Play Store</span></li><li>iPhone: <span style="text-decoration: underline">Buy now on the App Store</span></li><li>Nintendo 3DS: We are seeking a publisher to bring our game to this platform. If you are a licensed publisher, contact us.</li></ul><br />This began to change in July 2016 when Nintendo revamped its developer application process.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you own a Nintendo 3DS and you carry it with you, then you're probably willing to spend more than $5 (average) on a video game. Mobile implies casual gamer, and handheld implies being a step beyond casual since you bought specifically a video game playing device where the games aren't commonly $5 unless you go virtual console. Also, physical buttons. The two markets are different.

I'm expecting a standard NES style platform experience.<br /><br />I get to level 3, and the little sign in the level (up till now, a helpful advice on how the controls work)...says &quot;give us a rating in the Play Store and we'll give you 50 coins.&quot; No thanks. I get to level 5, and there's a little NPC. Oh, it's a store. And you buy game items with real money.<br /><br />Funny, I don't remember Mario ever asking me for $1 for a 1-up mushroom.<br /><br />Honestly, this ruined the game for me. I have no interest in playing it anymore. And, I'm a little sad about it.<br /><br />Can't we just have a nice game, that you just play? No ads, no micro-transactions, no BS.<br /><br />?

People are making too much money from the other model.

How about a racing game where billboards in the game are actual ads? Or a baseball game where the backstop has different ads? I think that would be pretty neat.

I've already used a lot of money in the UFO catcher game on 3DS to get badges and sometimes menu themes.
