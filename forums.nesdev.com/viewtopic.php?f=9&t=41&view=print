		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm designing some game enhancing hardware, I have no clue where to begin my hardware's exploit. The hardware will generate an interrupt, which should trigger the console to run some custom code. To do this, I think I need my hardware to hijack the IRQ vector for just that one instruction. How should I do this? What if the game is halted already in an interrupt? Can a register generate an IRQ before the next instruction? How fast are IRQs? Thanks!

<br />
<br />If the game is already in an interrupt, it won't work unless they enable IRQs inside the routine.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure what you mean by how fast can a register generate an IRQ.  But the IRQ is level-sensitive and pretty quick.  As soon as the current instruction finishes, it'll run the IRQ code if the /IRQ signal is low.
<br />
<br />But I don't know how to do what you're asking, really.

I was also sort of wondering if it could possibly be done without IRQs. Somehow if I could simply disable the ROM and get my hardware to feed the CPU "JSR $XXXX" that'd work just as well. I haven't thought about it too much but it seems it would screw up the game, at least the program counter no doubt. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Memblers wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If the game is already in an interrupt, it won't work unless they enable IRQs inside the routine.</div><br />I see, I'll take that into account. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Memblers wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'm not sure what you mean by how fast can a register generate an IRQ.

<br />I should have worded it: If I write to a theoretical register which will hold /IRQ low (lets say with 0 latency), will it happen before the system starts on the next instruction? I would like my hardware to intercept a write and generate an IRQ before the next instruction to give me some serious control over the system one instruction at a time.
