		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm pretty sure the update I was talking about was the Menu Flasher update. The previous version of my Multi-SRAM menu had a bug causing it not to properly backup 32 kilobyte (4 bank) save game data. This was causing Pokemon to always end up with corrupted SRAM data. <br /><br />The bug was the result of a typo in the source code. I fixed it and version 1.0a should work with 32kb save size games like Pokemon now. I believe me statement was about asking anyone to give Pokemon a try on the current menu and see if it retained their save data OK with other games as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay now I'm running into a new quirk. After writing to the SRAM from GB USB, my games still have the option to continue even after clearing the banks in the memory manager. Ive only tested on Pokemon but some data must not be getting cleared out. Is formatting the SRAM possible/practical?<br /><br />Also, giving myself another oportunity to sound dumb, could 32kb games share a universal RAM space? E.G. Having the block that stores the save be independent for each game but sharing the 3 blocks of reserved RAM amongst them. Or if all 4 blocks truly do have save data, just ignore me again.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If Pokemon was the last game you played when you deleted the save data with the manager, the same data still exists in banks 0-3, so if you load Pokemon again that data will be there and is still valid. You cannot delete banks 0-3. However by playing another game that uses SRAM it would change things enough to corrupt whatever is there if that's what you want to do.<br /><br />I'm not sure what you mean by 32kb games share &quot;universal&quot; ram space. I think what you may be confused about is in the save manager, a game that is 32kb save will have the following 3 blocks after the block with the game title marked as used. These are indeed used and should not be deleted unless you plan to delete all of the blocks for that game. <br /><br />The way it is designed is to maximize usefulness/storage space. The cartridge only has 128kbytes of SRAM. The first 32kbytes are used for the game that is being played. The remaining is divided into 8kb blocks with 1 reserved for the menu leaving 88kbytes or 11 &quot;blocks&quot; for game save data. The only thing that could &quot;possibly&quot; be done would be to attempt to implement compression for the save data. But that would introduce the possibility of problems when you run out of space. For example, maybe you have enough space and only have 16 bytes of storage left. You play your game and the save data changes just enough that now the compressed version won't fit in the available space. Now you can't backup the data and would have to delete something to free up enough room. It could be done though, but it's beyond what I want to do. The way the menu works out now, it's very useful with being able to have up to 11 different games save data, or a mix of 8k and 32k save games. It works, it's easy to use, and pretty simple in function.
