		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Bumping this back up because I'd like to revisit this.  I recently acquired a SFC that has 2 <span class="posthilit">vertical</span> bars that are extremely noticeable.  One in the center of the screen and the other on the far right.<br /><br />So this question keeps getting asked but never answered, but what lines need the extra power lines from the regulator, and caps?  Only the <span class="posthilit">line</span> going to the DRAM?  Would it be the VCC on the CPU? <br /><br />It would be much easier to just point out using this schematic if possible:<br /><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/2XS6fLC.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2XS6fLCl.png" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />I can't judge from the pictures TmEE posted because his revision is different from my own.

Or do what I did and just wire up a cxa2075, for some reason this encoder removes the translucent bar, and it's a better encoder than what any model <span class="posthilit">snes</span> ever came with anyway.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I realized that, you make it sound like that was some sort of revelation.  I was merely trying exactly what TmEE did first to see if I got any noticable results before I decided to get into the more difficult work of lifting power pins on the ppu and powering it with its own power rail, as I don't want to cut traces because if this ends up not doing anything I want to be able to reverse it.  I've also gotten some advice to try a pi filter along the vcc lines to both ppu's .

Silly me, taking the time to offer some advice when I could have just laughed at him.<br /><br /><br />On a serious note I imagine blargg is right, small gauge longer than necessary wires aren't likely to be of much help.  Although TmEE's wires are pretty small too, he did quite a few modifications though in addition to that and has a different mobo.  I really think the best no-nonsense solution is going to be a completely new power supply, or even better a separate supply for the PPUs.

Also, I'd venture to say &quot;ground bounce&quot; is the negative effect at work here.
