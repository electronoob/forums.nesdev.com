On NTSC, your loop should run about 341*262/3 = 29780 cycles; on PAL it should run 341*312/3.2 = 33247 cycles. So if a frame is less than about 31,500 cycles, it's NTSC (or PAL/M which uses the same timings as NTSC); otherwise, it's PAL.

If this happens in this case, you'll probably get a bad result. I'd use NMIs. Polling $2002 should never be done when timing is important. If you absolutelly *need* to wait for VBlank the old way, have the NMI set a flag and have the waiting code check this flag instead.

<br />Well, each editor uses a different number of spaces to represent TABs (Notepad's for example is ridiculously large), so if this board (or your browser, I don't know which one is converting TABs into spaces) uses something different than the editor where you wrote the code, it will look wrong. Note that some editors will let you configure that spacing though, and even convert the TABs into actual spaces if you choose to.
<br />
<br />That's kinda why I mostly gave up TABbed comments (although that seems to be some kind of standard in assembly)... They look pretty weird accross different editors, and some times I do use different editors. You know, those times when you have an urge to code and all that's available is Notepad! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

The problem is that rather then moving to the next tab stop (the next column evenly divisible three) it simply jumps three characters ahead regardless of the current position, which is amazingly fucked up.<br /><br />Just look at these examples, where a single tab precedes the comments:<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;;0<br />a&nbsp; &nbsp;;1<br />ab&nbsp; &nbsp;;2<br />abc&nbsp; &nbsp;;3<br />abcd&nbsp; &nbsp;;4</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">That's kinda why I mostly gave up TABbed comments (although that seems to be some kind of standard in assembly)...

<br />
<br />The only reason I can see to use a shorter tab size would be for indentation. And while I've tried in assembly code occasionally it has never really worked out. Perhaps if someone wrote an assembler with a excellent set of scoped flow control macros. But with every such system I've tested to date I've just ended up with a bunch of regular labels and branches intermixed with the high-level macros, making the scopes useless as visual cues for the program flow.

<br />
<br />Now according to the wiki you'd have to poll the status bit on exactly the right PPU clock for it to be missed, and as far as I can tell the only time a frame is an whole number of CPU cycles long is on odd NTSC frames when the display is enabled. And in any event a 7-cycle BIT/BPL spin loop isn't even close to being a factor in either standards' timing (though if you get a branch penalty the resulting 8-cycle loop might be).
<br />
<br />But then I'm far from certain about any of this and the PAL details seem a bit sketchy so I think I'd rather take my chances with a proper NMI and avoid all polling altogether.

The glitch only happens if you read on a specific PPU cycle, and since the PPU is 3x the speed of the CPU, and there isn't an integer number of CPU cycles per frame, it'd be impossible to hit the bug on two consecutive frames.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Now according to the wiki you'd have to poll the status bit on exactly the right PPU clock for it to be missed, and as far as I can tell the only time a frame is an whole number of CPU cycles long is on odd NTSC frames when the display is enabled.</div>
<br />
<br />1 frame = 262 scanlines
<br />1 scanline = 341 dots (PPU cycles)
<br />1 CPU cycle = 3 dots
<br />
<br />therefore 1 frame = 262*341/3 = 29780  + 2/3 CPU cycles
<br />
<br />1 dot is missing on the pre-render scanline on odd frames and if the PPU is on, so this could be 29780 + 1/3 cycles instead -- however that still isn't a whole number.
<br />
<br />PAL numbers:
<br />
<br />1 frame = 312 scanlines
<br />1 scanline = 341 dots
<br />1 CPU cycle = 3.2 dots
<br />
<br />therefore 1 frame = 312*341/3.2 = 33247 + 1/2 CPU cycles
<br />
<br />Note PAL does not skip that 1 dot on odd frames like NTSC does.

<br />Yeah, there are a few cases when missing a frame is no big deal. In this particular case though, during PPU warm-up, even NMIs can't be 100% trusted, as Bregalad said.

<br />Sorry for sounding like a noob, but what exactly would the value be in $2007 at this point if it was PAL?  0?  I'd prefer to do a CMP and store a number in a variable.
<br />
<br />I should also have this check at the beginning of my NMI, yes?
