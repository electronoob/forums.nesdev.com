Just a "it's mid-February, why is it 40 degrees in Minnesota?" quick update...<br /><br />I haven't put a new build out yet but hope to shortly.<br /><br />NESICIDE now allows creation of Tiles from 8x8 up to 256x256 in size, and Screens which are really just a special-case 256x240 Tile.  You can paint directly on the Tile/Screen with a pencil, line, box, circle, or filled-box or filled-circle tool, or you can paint with other Tiles.  Attributes are handled appropriately--the attributes of any affected 16x16 block will be changed to match the current tool color.<br /><br />It also does real-time 'tilification' [Bananmos...if you want, I'll call it something else out of respect for your sprite tool...but tilification seemed like an appropriate description].  You can create as many Tile objects as you want, of any size.  You don't necessarily have to pay attention to the content of each of the Tiles...just draw.  Then when you're ready to try to use those objects in a CHR-ROM, create a Graphics Bank, add all the Tile objects to the Graphics Bank's Tile list, and watch as redundant tiles are removed and your CHR-ROM bank image fills up.  Modify a Tile object in some way, save it, and the Graphics Bank re-tilifies the Tiles automatically.<br /><br />I will also be adding statistics, probably in a ToolTip fashion [hover over a CHR-ROM 8x8 tile, see what Tile object caused it to be included, see how many other times the 8x8 tile is used.  That will help in the process of eliminating 8x8 tiles that NESICIDE didn't because they weren't technically redundant.<br /><br />Also, each Tile object can have any number of 'properties' associated with it.  A property is a name/value pair, where the value is either a boolean, integer, string, or enumeration.  Multiple-choice-select is possible on enumerations.  Tile properties are project-wide.  Creating a new property and assigning it a default gives that new property to all Tiles.  Change only the ones you want to change.<br /><br />The Tile property information will be useful once I get around to building what I hope would be a generic Map Editor.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3705">cpow</a> â€” Fri Feb 17, 2012 8:51 pm</p><hr />
