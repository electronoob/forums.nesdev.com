<br />FC game PCB thickness = 0.050" (connector suitable for 0.054" â€“ 0.070")
<br />Industry standard thickness = 0.063" &lt;- tight fit in FC connector
<br />
<br />FC connector pin spacing/termination post length = 0.100"
<br />FC edge pin thickness = ~0.080"
<br />FC edge space between pin = ~0.020"
<br />Suitable FC edge (PCB) width = ~3.05"
<br />
<br />These are my measurements, can anyone concur? Does anyone have official measurements to FC/NES? What are your measurements for FC/NES?
<br />
<br />Does anyone have a recent Famiclone with a labeled connector (product code and MFGer) or know of a source for FC compatible connectors? 
<br />
<br />Same question for 72 pin connectors? (Not NES replacement connector please)

If you scan in grayscale or color, you can probably even get sub-pixel accuracy by incorporating how much mixing occurs at the edges. If the things were black and white, 50% gray at an edge would mean that the white and black meet in the middle of the pixel; 25% would mean that the black fills 75% of the pixel, etc.

<br />Nah, just scan it and turn on the grid function in Photoshop.  You can set the grid to any size interval, and set it to metric or inches.

<br />That's trusting that a 1200 DPI scanner is exactly 1200 DPI; scanning a ruler gives you the real DPI. Using the above procedure on a UMAX Astra 1200S scanner, I found 1172 DPI horizontal and 1199 DPI vertical where the scanner claimed 1200 for both. Of the two I thought horizontal would be closer, since that's governed by the optics as opposed to the stepper motor.

<br />Well, sure, I mean, as long as your ruler measures tenths of millimeters or smaller, sure, go for it.  Can't say I know where to find such a ruler, though.

<br />
<br />Why would that be necessary? All you need is a starting point and ending point on either edge of the scanned image, then you can divide and figure out the DPI.

<br />Maybe I'm missing something insanely obvious, but I don't see why you'd need a ruler with anything more than inch marks. Put a normal 12 inch ruler on the scanner, scan it, then measure the number of pixels between inch marks 1 and 9 (or more, if visible). Divide this by 8 and you have the number of pixels per inch, accurate to 1/8 pixel.
