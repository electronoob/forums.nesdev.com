		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK I'm going to mod my top loader NES, not because of the quality but just because I have no sound with RF, and I'd like to mode it so I can get some damn sound with it.
<br />
<br />Something I completely DONT understand is why everybody ignores what r73942 said on page 4 :
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I don't know if anyone has a better way of fixing the vertical line distortion in the top-loading NES, but I recently recuced it in mine by about 90-95%. My method, unfortunately, does require making a couple of cuts on the board, which I dreaded doing, but it was necessary for the mod. The problem is that the video signal coming out of the PPU is getting interference from the address/data lines, mainly AD7, since the pathways are so close together. Here's how to fix it: <br /><br />1) Find the pathway on the top side of the board connecting pin 21 of the PPU to Q1. <br />2) VERY CAREFULLY, cut this pathway as close to the PPU pin 21 as possible. BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO CUT THE ADJACENT PATHWAYS! Use an ohm-meter to make sure it's cut all the way through. <br />3) Now cut it as close to Q1 as possible. This is important! If you don't cut it at both ends, it will act like an antenna and thus not eliminating the interference. Make sure it's completely cut. <br />4) Look on the bottom of the board and find Q1. There's a pathway coming off of the front pin of Q1 leading to a test point near the power switch. <br />5) Connect a wire from PPU pin 21 to this test point. I recommend running the wire in an "S" fashion, coming off pin 21 at an angle following the diagonal +5V pathway there, then come around along the small ground plane going through the middle pin of Q2, then back along the next +5V pathway up to the test point. <br /><br />If you did this correctly, you should now have a nice clear picture.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Oh, yeah. I figured I'd mention this while I'm at it. Many people believe that adding AV jacks to the top-loading NES requires an additional transistor for the cideo signal. This is not true; Q1, when properly wired, can amplify the video signal sufficiently.</div>
<br />
<br />So everyone insisted FOR SIX PAGES to add an external amplification circuit when the source of the "problem" is just interference between the PPU and Q1 with the D7 line.
<br />
<br />
<br />Another problem : I want to remove the RF box (which is totally useless for me since I get white noise instead of sound out of it) but I just can't ! I tried everything i could this damn thing won't move, let alone let itself being removed off the board. I guess I'll have to drill a new hole instead of using the existing ones as I planned to do.
<br />
<br />Last thing : I wanted to do the sound mod to get external audio on powerpak, but unfortunately the expansion sound used for that DOES NOT EXIST !!
<br />Thanks god other expansion pins exists (they are just left unused), so it should be possible to get external audio with powerpak on a toploader if a version that sends it to another pin would be made.

<br />I remove them all the time, yes its rather difficult. I use a solder sucker to free the 3 pins feeding audio, video, and power to the modulator, then I cut the 3 mount/ground tabs as flush as I can and push them down with a hot soldering iron enough to a hold of the RF box with pliers and twist and yank it out.
<br />I also use a great little headphone style connector as an A/V jack that fits right into the old RF jack hole.

I think it's somehow glued to the AC jack so I'd have to disolder it, which I tried too but failed because again the pints were too huge to I couldn't remove all the solder (only part of it).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I've tried this and was not successful at completely eliminating the interference, but lifting or cutting pin 21 and getting it off the board works every time.</div>
<br />Belive it or not, a completely unmodded NTSC toploader looks ALOT better than the (only) PAL NES. The "walking ants" porblem at each discontinuities are SO much more noticeable in PAL, than the vertical lines on my NTSC toploader are preferable (I never had an USA frontloader nor a famicom so I can't tell by how much it'd be even better).
<br />Anyway even if it removes them but not completely I'd still be happy. Adding extra transistors doesn't sound any necessary to me.

I dont even mess with the tab closest to the edge, it will break free on its own when you pry and twist the mod unit out with needle nose pliers. Also, all this can be done without removing the screws that hold the plastic piece down, yes its also integrated into the power port and that would have to be desoldered as well in order to get it off the board entirely.

<br />Now I eventually get audio out of my toploader NES ! Unfortunately the video doesn't work any longer. All I can see is a bunch of dark pales colors going constantly up slowly.
<br />
<br />So I suppose the other guy was wrong when he said that the video signal was sufficiently amplified... looks like another amplifier will be needed <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />I'm unsure if the voltage, the current or both should be amplified.
<br />
<br />I'll look how I'll do that but if I need to add an extra breadboard I'll have a hard time finding room for it and fixing it properly.

<br />
<br />So my theory is that this is caused by the signal being too weak so that the TV can't detect the negative VBLank levels, and that the positive levels for colors are way too dark.
