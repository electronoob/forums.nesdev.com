If you've seen the growth curve over time, it has literally skyrocketed in the past few centuries.

Due to the current global economy's exploitation of developing countries, most of the world's industry has a direct human cost as well.

We all know there are alternative fuels and there are materials close to petroleum based plastics.

Well yeah what you need is pure air, clean water and decent food in order to matain life. Easy acess to common drinkable water and comfortable toilets is a huge plus. I however really wish the humanity could deal with only renewable sources of energy, so that it can go on forever without returning to a new stone age. But I'd say a new stone age may be better than the end of all humanity - but still I wouldn't be happy about both.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Nov 26, 2009 3:09 pm</p><hr />
