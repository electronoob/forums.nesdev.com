<br />
<br />Off-topic, sorta:
<br />
<br />I'm still of the opinion that Nintendo and all these old-school companies are bringing back classics for two-faced reasons.  There's the obvious fact that most present-day video games suck ass (us old codgers tend to prefer fun and good gameplay over fancy graphics; HEY, ANYONE WANT TO PLAY <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Rigs:_Over_the_Road_Racing" class="postlink">BIG RIGS??</a>), and as such a definite market demographic for classic games.  Emulators paved that way for that market.  But on the flip side, this "renews" (for lack of better term) copyright lawsuit legitimacy on classic games; companies can now claim, for example, that piracy of a NES game (ROM) made in 1989 has negative impact on their cash flow today.  It saddens me how the whole "classic gaming" market is partially driven by ulterior motives.
<br />
<br />America, fuck yeah, comin' again to save the motherfuckin' day yeah!

<br />
<br />I've heard that the 3D slider doesn't just control the amount of 3D, but pulls back the camera to give you a wider view like the one seen in the video.
<br />
<br />I read a statement earlier that I can't find now that specifically said it was remade from the ground up and only uses similar physics, graphics and sound.
<br />
<br />The 3DS update that includes this game for free should come out sometime later today, most people are guessing late in the day, perhaps 12 hours from now.
<br />
<br />In reply to koitsu, sure, they <em>can</em> do that now, but do they actually take advantage of it?  Has any company made a big deal out of emulated games?  Microsoft Game Room, PS1 Classics, Virtual Console...have any of them given trouble to people who emulate, aside from the usual "patching out homebrew," where the blocking of emulation is incidental at best?

It adds a bit more value to the download then just letting me download unmodified Game Boy roms on an emulator. I see how they want to keep the 3ds virtual console all portable games, and the Wii personal console all console games, but I do wish they'd mix both. I'd like to see the GB games on the Wii's virtual console, and the console games on the 3DS virtual console.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I mean I'd like them to keep remaking NES (or SuperNES) games in 3D because it adds more value to the traditional virtual console game which is nothing more than a ROM and emulator. But also I notice on the Virtual Console that they only seem to offer Gameboy and Gameboy Color games on the 3DS and Console games on the Wii. I would like it if they would offer games for all systems on both Virtual consoles. For example Gameboy games on the Wii's virtual console and NES, SNES and Genesis games etc. on the 3DS virtual console. 
<br />
<br />Also for some reason paying to download a Super Metroid rom on my Wii seems more worth the money to me than paying to download a Super Mario Land rom on my 3DS. But if I could play Super Mario Land 2 on my Wii I might download that.

If I didn't already have a still perfectly working original NDS, I'd definitely buy the new one along with Ocarina of Time on a whim.
<br />
<br />All of this makes me wish that I knew more about how this 2D/3D-trickery really works as it ultimately has made me wondering about whether or not this effect to at least a certain level can be applied to older games, like SNES, NES, etc.

<br />You can't automatically create depth where originally there was none. It's like this guy that showed up here saying that his NES emulator would display games in red-blue 3D. Most of these old games don't have any depth information, and the few ones that do don't use a unified format, so there's no way to automatically create 3D images from 2D games.
<br />
<br />Conversion to 3D is a game-per-game task, where you have to associate a depth to every on-screen element and use that information to generate 2 2D views slightly displaced from each other. Then you can present these 2 images in various ways (red/blue glasses, polarized glasses, special screens, etc.) that allow peoples' brains to join the 2 images into 1 3D image.

<br />
<br />I knew that there would be nothing automatic about this, but thought that perhaps some kind of simple 3D-effect could be applied somewhat easily (in theory only.)
<br />I've never been one to care for such 3D-effects, but after today I can see that it's more than just a gimmick.  Better have to search it up and see if I can't learn a little
<br /> about it. :-)

Super NES games would be even easier: assign each emulated layer a distance value.

<br />
<br />Yeah, it would look kinda weird in games where sprites are used as background elements (e.g. hitting a ? block in Super Mario Bros.), but for the most part I think it'd look kinda neat. You could even get <em>controversial</em> and hijack an unused OAM bit to specify whether a sprite should be rendered in split red/blue (pushing it into the background) or not, and then people could hack a game's sprite engine to set these bits only for specific "background" sprite types.
