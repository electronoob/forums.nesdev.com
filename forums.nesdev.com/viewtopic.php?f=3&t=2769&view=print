<br />I call BS. Nonstandard ROM sizes are only valid for special mappers which specifically expect the game data to be stored in multiple ROM chips. Also, if the "common dumps" of those two games have odd CHR sizes, then they are <strong>bad dumps</strong> and should not be supported by <em>any</em> emulators.

It's something I've been meaning to accomidate for in my emu anyway since some ROM hackers expand CHR but don't necessarily bump it up to the next power-of-2 size.  (*thinks of Mario Adventure*)<br /><br />Regardless, it's still not behavior I would encourage for homebrew developers or ROM hackers.  I'm still of the opinion that (barring special circumstances, like multiple chips; e.g.  Action 52) PRG/CHR/RAM should maintain a clean power-of-2 size.<br /><br />But like I said -- it's not like I'm saying he's in the wrong -- it's just something I thought I'd bring up.  Whatever the case, I've just "fixed" this in my emu so the demo works even with its $11 CHR size.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You'll notice that the common dumps of <em>Smash TV</em> and <em>Tetris 2</em> also have undersize CHR.</div>
<br />
<br />Apparently I don't have those dumps (or deleted them in favor of the [!] dumps -- which have power-of-2 sizes).

<br />
<br />Under my interpretation, no games work when trimmed.  Therefore none should be trimmed.  For one thing, HD space is so cheap in the modern era that it shouldn't matter if your ROM is 256k instead of 172k.

Under my interpretation of your interpretation, no games work when compressed with PKZIP because the NES hardware cannot directly read PKZIP data. Replicating the last bank of CHR from the end of the file to the end of the address space (for example in a 112 KB CHR on an S*ROM board, replicating the last 4 KiB up to 128 KiB) is just a means of compression.<br /><br />If trimmed roms are forbidden, then why does the iNES format store the number of banks and not the base 2 logarithm of the number of banks?

<br />Is hard drive space still cheap if you are building an adapter to read CF or SD memory cards into a pair of PSRAMs on an NES cart board?

Where is Marat when you need him to clarify details of the interpretation of the format that he created?</div><br />Marat's documentation leads me to believe he thinks the NES has "banks" at $8000 and $C000, not simply a partially decoded ROM; this and because the "smallest" licensed games have 16k PRG ROM it seems he decided upon 16k  PRG banks. In reality, few if any licensed or unlicensed games use less than 8k of PRG ROM nor do they address banks in smaller granularity than 8k (except for NSF?) Having 16k iNES PRG banks still allows for theoretical unlicensed games which have one small PRG ROM (256Kbit) and one big PRG ROM (2Mbit) or something without having to pad. Since we now know there are FC games with 64Kbit PRG ROM, Marat should have chosen 8k banks for PRG. Perhaps he already knew this but used 16k banks since he knew of 32Mbit unlicensed games and didn't want to extend the PRG ROM size to more than 8 bits.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Is hard drive space still cheap if you are building an adapter to read CF or SD memory cards into a pair of PSRAMs on an NES cart board?</div>
<br />Yes seeing how a single memory card can now hold an uncompressed single good dump of at least every licensed game for at least NTSC regions.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This same issue comes up with the various game music file formats, what data to use for unspecified bytes and what multiple the data is mirrored to banks beyond the end. The dispute seems to be over what to do when the last n bytes of a PRG/CHR ROM are all filled with the byte $FF. One party suggests to leave it, since it uses very little hard disk space uncompressed, and just a few bytes if the file is compressed in some way (note that compression can be considered part of the filing system implementation, thus compressing an iNES file is not making it a non-iNES file, just adding another layer of representation). The other party suggests that these bytes be removed and an emulator guess at the correct size, presumably a power of two, and reconstruct this removed data. One problem with this approach is that it assumes that <em>all</em> NES cartridges have a power of two PRG and CHR size.

<br />The iNES format has a field for the generic class of boards (e.g. S*ROM = 1, U*ROM = 2, CNROM = 3, T*ROM = 4, P*ROM = 9). For board classes that are not capable of taking more than one ROM chip, FF-pad the CHR ROM to the next 8 KiB boundary. The PRG ROM is more difficult, as the CPU expects the reset vector to be in the bank mapped to $Fxxx, which a lot of boards fix to the last bank in PRG. For this, <em>replicate</em> the last 16 KiB PRG bank until the next power of 2. However, I don't think any NES ROMs in the wild have truncated PRG, just truncated CHR.
