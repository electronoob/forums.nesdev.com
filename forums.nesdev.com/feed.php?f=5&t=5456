It is up to us, and our very subjective perceptions, to determine what is or isn't a toy.  If playing with a toy makes you happy, picture that happy image.  If you want to think you're above that, think of it in a different light.  People attach labels to things; there's no cosmic rule mandating or governing it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3959">naI</a> — Sat Aug 08, 2009 8:12 pm</p><hr />

Hockey is a game; the puck and sticks are toys. Chess is a game; the pieces are toys.<br /><br />A "video game" is a computer simulation of toys and of a game involving those toys. But the player need not play the game; there's an article on Slashdot right now about <a href="http://games.slashdot.org/story/09/08/08/0345231/Finding-New-and-Unintended-Ways-of-Playing-Games?art_pos=3" class="postlink">players who play their own games with the toys, not the intended game</a>. For example, a sandbox video game has plenty of toys, and the player can play the "game" (mission) or not. In SimCity, the player can put down zones (toys), and the player can choose to make a game out of it (scenarios) or not (marathon mode). In Grand Theft Auto 3 and later, the player can go steal cars (toys) and do sidequests (games) with or without entering the main mission (game).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Aug 08, 2009 10:43 am</p><hr />
