Yeah, sorry, I didn't mean to make this like some who-deleted-my-post investagation, because as far as I'm concerned, I don't care. Yeah, I could've just copied the text from the post being edited, deleted the old post, posted a new message, pasted the text from the old post into the new post, and wrote "EDIT: ...." on the bottom. If you don't know what I mean, don't bother trying to, because it doesn't matter, really.<br /><br />But did anybody experience these types of problems while using CopyNES? What are some reasons for a random almost-full-functioning CopyNES, as aposed to a not functioning system telling the software that it is CopyNES v.0? What connections on the copyNES board might be not well? AND! CopyNES only seems to return proper information about it's board while a game is in the system, pushed down, power on, and a gray screen. The thing is, I think data is still being read from the cart while it shows a gray screen. It's weird, and it randomly works, and I don't know why, and I'd appreciate a little advice <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.

EDIT: Scratch all of that. I got it to read my version, but it took a while. And it seems the cart has to be pushed down, being read, with nothing on the TV in order to be read by the software. It's rather annoying. But when I try and dump the cart, it unloades any exsisting plugin, then it initializes port, and tries and loads the plugin, but the operation times out. What is wrong here? Is the cart not inserted well enough? is there something wrong with my BIOS settings? I'm pretty sure I've tried it on both Biconditional and EPP. I know I've tried it on Biconditional, but I'm not sure about EPP. I'll go try EPP. That's what it's supposed to be set to correct?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Fri Feb 10, 2006 12:23 am</p><hr />

Sorry, I know that you are supposed to somehow use the copyNES program to test it, but I get an error message each time. It's the one that's like: "Path not found in line No line number in module NESDUMP   at address 0FAA: 4BE0 Hit any key to return to system. "<br /><br />First of all: what? Second of all, what does that mean? That's the error message you get when the thing isn't on/connected/related to the computer in any way. My copyNES is on, the cord is connected, a game will play in the copynes, but it isn't associated with the computer in any way. Okay, let me just ask a few questions. Are you supposed to turn the power on at a certain time? Are you supposed to insert a cartridge at a certain time? Is the copyNES supposed to allow you to play a cart like a regular NES all the time? Sorry, I'm just trying to fix my copyNES, and I'm confused why it doesn't work. It makes me upset! Thanks to anyone who responds. =)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Thu Feb 09, 2006 9:12 pm</p><hr />

Okay, I've brought up this dead forum like 10000 times, but this is the last. I have put my copyNES together, and so far, the NES part of my copyNES works, but I don't know if the COPYNES part of the copyNES works. He said something about how to test it that I didn't get. How am I supposed to test and see if the copyNES part of the copyNES is working with the PC? <br /><br />I hope it works, I did notice a small tear in an I/O line by the cable connector, but I made the lines touch again, and I attempted to have a wire starting from 1 end to the other end of the I/O line, but it sort of broke off. Would that work? just a solder wire going from point A to point B substituting for a broken I/O line? I think the line should still be connected though. What are you even supposed to do for a broken I/O line?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Wed Feb 08, 2006 4:58 pm</p><hr />
