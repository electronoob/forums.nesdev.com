		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Three things can be done in the emulator. All three methods would require configuration for each individual game (or at least for each company's music engine). I'll try to explain each of them using simpler language and give each a name so we have a reference point for further discussion.<br /><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>Wavetable method: Replace the square and triangle samples with other short looping samples. The result would sound like a Namco 163 game. </li><li>Non-causal method: Watch the writes to the 2A03 audio ports, and after several frames, look at the duty, volume, and pitch to figure out what instrument the game was trying to play. This would add lag between the input and audio while the emulator is mapping the duty and volume to a most likely instrument, making it useful for NSFs and for rendering input-log movies to video but not for real-time play. </li><li>Expansion method: Patch the game at runtime to send note-on messages, such as MIDI notes through a Miracle piano, instead of playing the notes through the 2A03 audio ports. This is the same process as patching a game to use Famicom expansion audio. </li></ol>

Just because it's an anticausal technique doesn't mean you have to emulate it with latency: it just means you need to emulate the future (and assume input from the player) to figure out what sound to play in the present. Computers are perfectly capable of doing just that. It's even perfectly possible to look at the exceptions to what you expected will have been played and use it to change what's being now, to compensate for assuming future player input.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mikejmoffitt wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I think by this he means that listening to a N163 or VRC6 game is not really achieving what he'd like to hear.<br /></div>If his point was &quot;I don't want to listen to something that's <em>only</em> been upgraded to N163 sound&quot;, I addressed that: tepples clearly meant &quot;using expansion audio&quot; as shorthand for &quot;providing a MIDI-like abstraction to the NES&quot;.

But other than that keys held this frame will likely equal keys held last frame, you can't really predict input from the player. So expect a huge spike in CPU usage to re-emulate the whole NES several frames ahead whenever a player presses or releases a button.
