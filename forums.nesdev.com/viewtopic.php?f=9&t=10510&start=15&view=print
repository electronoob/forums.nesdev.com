Of course you can use a single 128K chip if that is less expensive (it also doesn't require the selection logic), but you should leave one address pin tied to ground if the NES 2.0 header (if it is present) specifies only 64K PRG RAM (or, if the mapper is MMC5, Disch's documentation specifies 64K as the default; my own &quot;Mapper D&quot; allows up to 2M, but should still be 64K by default for compatibility with MMC5).
