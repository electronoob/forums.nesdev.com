for what i do know the genesis has actualy 10 soundchannels whereass 4 were originaly intended for sms games but they can do all work simonteniousely in md modes.<br />channel 6 can can do 8bit pcm samples i guess at 54 khz.<br />the snes has 8 digital soundchannels,those samples are in 4bit brr format,but those samples are decoded,reconstructed into 16bit 32khz,will the guessian filter does remove annoying noise but sadly also futher reduces the quality,the annalogue lowpass filter gives a nice mega bass sound and remove extra noise but also sadly eliminate even more hich freq,s,will the 4bit samples are upsampled to 16bit to compensate degradation,you will end up with a somewhat flatty,muffed sound,trough voices sounds can be fairly okey but sometomes<br />voices sounds more like they were recorded behind bars/dours,even then they can be still scratchy or noisy if the recording was bad done.<br />but the best advantage of the snes chip is, it can also stream 100% true 16bit 32khz samples toobad a 3 minute audio track takes up more space then even the largest snes game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4813">johannesmutlu</a> — Wed Mar 16, 2011 5:50 am</p><hr />

The SNES DSP is already using a very complex waveform. More complex than what even 4 operators can deliver form FM synths.  It would akin to having one channel's final output of the 2612 modulate another channel entirely. But the DSP is already working with complex waveforms, so I don't see a real need for this.

You can get nice sound from SNES, but you can also get the same from MD, in FM its just little more pain to get "real" sounding instruments... on SNES you can just use recording of a real instrument... Also, you may want to hear the demo of a MD game "Pier Solar and the Great Architects" once its out, then you can hear that MD can do much more than techno. BTW, the game uses my sound engine.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.hot.ee/tmeeco3/CA-TITLE.OGG" class="postlink">http://www.hot.ee/tmeeco3/CA-TITLE.OGG</a> - some kind of metal<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3483">TmEE</a> — Sat Feb 16, 2008 9:20 am</p><hr />

I agree with Bregalad - IMO, "Rave Dancetune" used very poor samples, and I believe the SNES version could've sampled waveforms more or less richer than the Genesis's FM synthesized waveforms.  Although the Genesis version's "Rave Dancetune" <em>is</em> superior to the SNES version and is one of the better Genesis songs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3329">strangenesfreak</a> — Sat Feb 16, 2008 8:51 am</p><hr />

Stop doing bad publicity for the SNES sound, which is able of more than this, I'm pretty sure, even when it comes to do techno. Most early SNES games use the hardware pretty badly, because good samples at high sampling rate takes a lot of space, and most games have only one set of samples they write once in memory and never touches again, greatly limiting the number of available samples (and quality too) as opposed to games that change samples for each song as they need them.<br /><br />You could rather listen the soundtrack in Chrono Trigger, and then you'll see that it puts the Megadrive to shame.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Feb 16, 2008 8:13 am</p><hr />

Well, anyone seems to deny how much better the SNES sound is compared to the Megadrive (at least emulated, I have no real Megadrive).<br />Hironically, the Megadrive can make things that are hard to reproduce on the SNES processor, both are in fact different. The Megadrive SPU is rather good for techno, and can output awesome synth-bass sound, but aside of that most instruments sound horrible. The SNES CPU would be pretty hard to reproduce techno, but WAY better at reproducting more classic music tunes.<br />32KHz isn't a lot, but if you keep the sampling rate of all your samples high (something most commercial games don't for memory-saving purposes, but some like Chrono Trigger or Dragon Quest 3/6 actually does), it can output very good sound.<br />The SNES is also bad at reproducting NES/Gameboy sound due to interpolation. It is good however to make music actually intended to be played with real instruments, where both the NES and the Megadrive music falls flat.<br /><br />I guess if I were to ever code something for the Megadrive I'd just use FM synthetis for synth basses and sound effects, and leave melody for PSG channels. That way you could have Mega Man Battle Network-like music, heh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Feb 16, 2008 2:17 am</p><hr />
