I would say 90-95% of the time this is not a &quot;simple&quot; task.

Disassemble the NES ROM and convert all use of VRC4 registers to a supported mapper, maybe MMC3?<br /><br />2. Disassemble the NES mini software and add support for the VRC4 mapper.<br /><br />I think the second approach is more useful, because if you can add one mapper to the software you can add them all. It would lay the foundation for getting all sorts of games on there. The first approach will only change that one game, and they're probably roughly equivalent amounts of work (though each requires experience with a different kind of system).

Nintendo may have &quot;done just enough&quot; to make it play games provided on the device itself, rather than a full implementation.  Again: nobody knows for sure as of this writing.  I would really not recommend that mapper either (too complicated).<br /><br />In general, MMC5 should not be chosen just because it's &quot;the last/latest mapper Nintendo did&quot;; that doesn't necessarily make it a feasible choice for conversions.  With regards to the OPs inquiry, it really depends on what features of the VRC2/VRC4 Boku Dracula-kun uses (this requires RE'ing of the code and fully understanding it), followed by reviewing in depth each of the supported mappers by the device and then redesigning/reassembling the entire game to use said mapper.  I imagine debugging/troubleshooting will be immensely painful (i.e. stick to using emulators first, then once you get something working, try it on actual hardware).

I gave up on mapper hacking Gradius 2 because<br /><ul><li>The game was randomly crashing for an unknown reason that I wasn't able to figure out (probably interrupt / IRQ related)</li><li>The IRQ scanline counter of MMC3 is incapable of working properly when sprites from both pattern tables are simultaneously used, and Gradius III does exactly that. Changing this is almost impossible, since the game was designed that way.</li></ul>As a result I had at some point a playable, but glicthy Gradius 2 rom hack that would run on MMC3 and randomly crash on later levels when the game lagged too much. Since I saw no value in this hack I simply removed it.<br /><br />Also, since the explosion of bootlegged cartriges that are sold for a high price on the internet, I also retracted my japanese Contra hack to MMC3.<br /><br />I think trying to do Boku Drakula-kun on MMC3 would be difficult because you'd enter in smilar issues to those I encountered when hacing Gradius II to MMC3 - you could probably get a working version but it would have glitched graphics and might crash. Probably not something actually worth playing. Boku Dracula-kun also changes the mirroring mode very regularly in bizzare ways, and uses one-screen mirroring, which MMC3 does not support. Maybe TLSROM variant would be an option, but heh... is the effort really worth is, when you can just play the game on another emulator ?

The first thing to do is to see where the game writes to its bankswitching registers, and replace it with bankswitching for the new mapper.

Not that the latter sounds particularly fun either... Personally, I hardly see the &quot;I wanna play game X on platform Y&quot; situation as strong enough motivation for such extensive hacking, specially when there are other options for playing that are just as good (a Raspberry Pi in this case, maybe).
