<br /><ul><li>Pro Wrestling wasn't the only game to use Pro Wrestling's title screen music. </li><li>Joust wasn't the only game to use Joust's title screen music. </li><li>Guitar Hero and Rock Band use the same music occasionally, and GH3 even used "Paranoid" that was earlier heard in Rock n Roll Racing. </li><li>The NES version of Jurassic Park used the theme from Comic Bakery, whose bass line has more than a passing resemblance to "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)". </li><li>E1M1 from Doom sounds awfully similar to "Caverns of Cthulu" from Klax for NES. </li><li>K.K. Song. Oh gosh, K.K. Song. </li><li>Konami has recycled some of its old games' songs into Beatmania and Dance Dance Revolution songs. Compare Burning Heat from Gradius 2 to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXV0_CF-tZQ" class="postlink">Burning Heat from DDRMAX 2: DDR 7th Mix</a>. </li></ul>Some examples involve appropriation of pieces that are either public domain or believed to be public domain: <ul><li>Home Alone (for Super NES) used two pieces by Tchaikovsky that have appeared in Tetris: "Dance of the Sugar-Plum Fairy" (music 1 from Tetris for NES) and "Russian Dance Trepak" (the B-type level 9 completion music from Tetris for Game Boy). </li><li>Tet—èis by Atari Games used "Troika" and "Karinka" from Tetris (J), and here's the kicker: the NES port of Atari Games's version even kept the Engrish misspelling of the latter. </li><li>Dance Dance Revolution Extreme used "Sakura", the entry theme of a Punch-Out!! opponent, as one of the "Legend Road" songs. </li><li>Tetris for NES used another Punch-Out!! opponent's entry theme as the B-type completion music. </li></ul>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Many composers recycle themselves non-purposely. For example it's fun how "Kuja's theme" in FF9 is partially recicled off "Intention of the Earth" from FF5, and how "Riding Shoopuf" of FF10 is partially reciled of "Main Theme" of FF4.
<br />It's not like the intentionally remixed songs however, such as "Fanfare" or "Gurugu's Volcano".

<br />Both games have the same composer though, obviously. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />Adventure Island 2 and 3 (NES) seem to share a lot of music as well, but that's really no surprise. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />Edit: And then there's Totaka's song that shows up in numerous games, but that's another story for another time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It seems likely that the thread starter meant music literally reused across games such as his example or Jurassic Park/Comic Bakery, but it is also interesting to just point out similarities between themes.
<br />
<br />One I always thought was neat is the melody from the ending of Super Mario Bros. 2 making an appearance in Breath of Fire 2, only much slower.  Unlike many reappearing melodies which are only vague similarities, this one is almost note for note.  Compare:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPXtir65p40#t=0m58s" class="postlink">Mario 2</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETM9xpTgdE0" class="postlink">Breath of Fire 2</a>
<br />
<br />Of course it's kind of an obvious chord progression, which I can imagine being recreated by accident.  It sounds like it's based on Canon in D's sort of progression.
