		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been trying to build a simple SNROM devcart for several months now; my attempts have become more and more discouraging and slowed me down a lot. I thought I'd been using the right instructions, at least  <a href="http://nesdev.com/NES%20EPROM%20Conversions.txt" class="postlink">the only one that seens to exist right now</a>. I'm using a Pm29F002T-12PC; a 2 megabit Flash ROM. the EPROM conversions seem to make sense, the pinouts seem to be the same as for a standard 2 Mbit EPROM and I've made sure the correct data is on the chip.
<br />
<br />4 of my favorite games (not rare, at least) have now been destroyed for all my efforts. I figured when I finally succeed with one I will know what is required and maybe notice something I had previously missed with the others enabling me to fix them, but as of yet I've had abysmal luck.
<br />
<br />has anyone else had problems building an SNROM cart? is there something obvious that I'm perhaps missing? I've made sure WE# is pulled high and CE# and OE# are pulled low, all that sort of stuff, and there were only two address pins re-routed which I've been very careful about.
<br />
<br />somebody please tell me what I'm doing wrong!

<br />
<br />but I don't mind spending that, as long as they eventually work. Building a devcart hasn't proven to be irredeemably stressful yet. I want to have a handful of devcarts at my disposal as opposed to one super-versatile one. 
<br />
<br />E.g. If I want to run 3 separate NES animations at one time I'd rather not order 3 PowerPaks just for this purpose, or if I want to play 2 or more NES music tracks over each other and switch them physically, without a menu etc...
<br />
<br />and please don't suggest emulation <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":-|" title="Neutral" />
<br />
<br />another advantage of being able to make one out of a very common game is that I could distribute homebrew programs to people, and give them as gifts.

<br />
<br />Wouldn't dream of it.  I do a typical dev cycle of a couple hours of rapid dev/test with emulators. Then a final night test on real hardware with the PowerPak. Saves me the effort of erasing/burning flash chips. Hardware testing is the final kick in the nuts for something like this.
<br />
<br />As for distributing SNROM, grab a RetroUSB PCB. $9 as far as I can tell.  Though I can't speak for them since I haven't used that yet and my game uses UNROM (and thus I save $5).

<br />
<br />but I'd still have to desolder a lockout chip or order one, not to mention a case, and supplies of NES carts are still plentiful.
<br />
<br />all that's required to make a devcart is a donor cart, a compatible ROM chip, possibly a DIP socket and the right method...it's the latter which eludes me right now.

<br />As far as lock-out chips are concerned, you really should snip that.  Nothing better in the world than dealing with an uppity NES that immediately runs better after being neutered.  Calms the hell down just like a Rottweiler.

<br />I am building an SNROM dev cart myself (parts should be in tomorrow, I am SO excited <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />) out of parts from RetroZone. I decided against canabilizing an Ultima Exodus cart because I thought all the pin bending was a bit too much hassle.
<br />
<br />Here's the <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7550&amp;highlight=" class="postlink">thread where we discussed it</a>. See the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC1_Development_Cart" class="postlink">unfinished Wiki Page</a> for an accurate parts inventory.
<br />
<br />After I have assembled and tested the cart I will complete the Wiki page with instructions.

<br />
<br />If you can find an AT29C256 (32kB), you can use those with NROM and CNROM boards without any rewiring.  Then burn the program onto an OTP 27C256 or 27C512 if/when you're done editing it.

<br />I've already got NROM figured out and it's served its limited purpose for me. SNROM adheres to all the specs I need as well as the mapper I've decided on using regularly.
