<br />=P   Why not?
<br />
<br />Anyway... I'm a little confused.  Is it <em>really</em> that MMC3 can't access 1MB?  Or is it just that no boards have that much PRG on them?  Like... does the MMC3 just not have enough pinouts?
<br />
<br />I'm not really very knowledgable when it comes to hardware.  I tried making sense of the pinout on <a href="http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/mmc3/index.html" class="postlink">kevtris' page</a>, and it looks like it has pins going up to PRG A18... but wouldn't that make the cap 256K?  Obviously I'm misunderstanding because games have more than that.

<br />There are a total of 19 pins, numbered A0, A1, A2, ..., A18, going into the PRG ROM's address bus. A0 through A12 come from the NES PRG bus, and A13 through A18 come from the MMC3. If you have 19 address pins and 8 data pins, you can address 2^19 octets = 512 KiB.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />$6000 is within battery-backed SRAM. If you are going to use it to implement a mapper, like that mapper with CHR ROM that shares BNROM's iNES number, you'll have to make sure that the code does not rely on the contents of $6000 being preserved over bank switches or over power cycles. You'll also have to duplicate the fixed banks (last 16 KiB) in both the bottom and top half of the ROM so that interrupt handlers jump to somewhere sane.
