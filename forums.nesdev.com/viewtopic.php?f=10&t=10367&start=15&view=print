It's 4 writes against 3, two of which need a certain amount of bit shifting to form the proper value.

Do not let anyone here tell you &quot;it's simple&quot;, because these people already have great familiarity with it -- don't be disheartened by their words.  There is still to this day an immense dichotomy between the hardware-familiar people in nesdev and the software-focused people in nesdev.  Anyway, read this section:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_scrolling#What_the_registers_do">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_ ... gisters_do</a><!-- m --><br /><br />If you're anything like me, you'll probably read it the same way I have (and in some regards still do): blah blah, latch blah, Loopy_Blah, single-letter variables, internal blah blah, flip-flop blah blah, and more blah blah.  This is just the nature of the beast with the NES -- when it comes to the PPU, the registers in question are not &quot;fully independent&quot; of other features/things because of how the hardware was designed.  It's like this on even older consoles too (ex. Atari 2600), where everything was even more bare bones.  This document:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/The_skinny_on_NES_scrolling">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/The_ ... _scrolling</a><!-- m --><br /><br />...is a lot more revealing in what all goes on, but it's way too much for the &quot;standard programmer&quot; to take in -- it's overkill in a lot of ways.  But if you read it (and even if you don't understand it all) you'll see that there are continual mentions of what everyone has said -- that $2000, $2002, $2005, and $2006 all share an intricate relationship behind the scenes.<br /><br />There are other consoles where this this stuff is less of a &quot;problem&quot; (for the programmer), and it's one reason I still to this day prefer to code on those other consoles.  IMO, nothing PPU-related on the NES is simple.<br /><br />Since you offer some kind of &quot;online course in NES programming&quot;, I fully support you writing programmer-focused documentation that gradually introduces people to these nuances.  You will end up touching registers even during simple tasks that you didn't think you needed to -- and aren't obviously apparent to your students, prompting them to ask &quot;Why are you doing that?&quot;  You'll have to say &quot;For now just trust me, it's needed&quot; and cover the reason in a later chapter/section (advanced PPU operations, etc.) with references/links to the above stuff.  You can see that the PPU-related parts <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Programming_guide#Tutorials" class="postlink">of the tutorial section of the Wiki</a> are lacking (this is due to people not having the time -- documentation sucks up a lot of time, I speak from experience :P).

Do not let anyone here tell you &quot;it's simple&quot;, because these people already have great familiarity with it -- don't be disheartened by their words.</div><br />I don't have all that much understanding of how the underlying hardware work, and I disagree on saying this is complex, at least not as much as what loopy says (unless you want to know the underlying hardware).<br /><br />All you have to memorize is that the scroll can be seen as two sides of the same same coin.<br />1) The X / Y offset. This is the usual way to understand scrolling. X = [0; 511] and Y = [0; 511] (some of the range of the Y scroll are discouraged as they will display the attribute table as name table, but you probably don't want to do this - but that's another story). Registers $2005 (and lower 2 bits of $2000) view the scroll from this viewpoint.<br />2) The VRAM address. This is a single word that goes ADR = [$2000 ... $2fff]. Reigster $2006 view the scroll from this viewpoint. Note that this very logical since $2006 is used to set VRAM adresses.<br /><br />Now if you want to scroll to a certain position you can either write the X/Y scroll via $2005 or the VRAM adress via $2006, and both of those methods works.<br />HOWEVER, each of those methods have huge drawbacks :<br />$2005/2 (vertical scroll) writes only works during VBlank, so this method is problematic during the frame.<br />$2006 writes can't set the fine scroll within a tile, because you address whole tiles.<br /><br />If you change the scroll outside of VBlank, you can choose between $2005 and $2006. $2005 (and $2000) is good for changing horizontal scrolling, $2006 is good if you want to scroll whole tiles.<br />Now if you want to both change fine scrolling and vertical scrolling, you have to mix $2005 and $2006 writes in a weird way, because only $2005/1 and $2006/2 writes will be taken in account. All other writes will simply be &quot;latched&quot; and have no immediate effect. This is the only part that is &quot;complicated&quot; but it's really quite simple. Just write the values you'd write if you were only writing to $2005, and only to $2006, and it'll work perfectly. You don't have to understand what is the V and T latches or other bullshit to make this work, I can guarantee this to you.<br /><br />I hope this was clear enough to get my idea ^^<br />Everyone on NESDev has been overcomplicating this for years when I figured out that it was in reality quite simple. The only &quot;complex&quot; thing is $2005/2 and $2006/1 writes being ineffective before a $2006/2 write happens.<br /><br />EDIT : Ok I'll have a practical example. Let's say you want to set the scroll to Y = 9 and X = 12 (I just picked random values). This correspond to nametable adress $2021 (one tile left and one tile down).<br /><br />So if you were to write $20 then $21 to $2006 it'd set Y = 8 and X = 8 (in reality it'll set Y = 10 but forget this for now*).<br />If you were to write 12 then 9 to $2005 it'd set X = 9 and Y will remain unnafacted.<br />Both are not what you want.<br />But if you mix them in some way, for example :<br />$2005(/1) = 12<br />$2005(/2) = 9<br />$2005(/1) = 12<br />$2006(/2) = $21<br />it will work.<br /><br />Another alternative would be<br />$2006(/1) = $20<br />$2005(/2) = 9<br />$2005(/1) = 12<br />$2006(/2) = $21<br /><br />or why not<br />$2006(/1) = $10*<br />$2006(/2) = $21<br />$2005(/1) = 9<br /><br />All of them should work, and if they don't there is probably some other orders that will. As long as you keep writing $x0 to $2006(/1), $21 to $2006(/2), and 12 to $2005(/1) and 9 to $2005(/2), you can try any order, and many of them will work. Just trial and error. No need to understand loopy's doc.<br /><br />*) This is another thing to know is that the fine vertical scroll is given by the high nybble of the VRAM adress (normally used to differenciate pattern tables and name tables and palette), I never understood why, it's damn stange, but it's that way. Can only work for scroll values 0 to 3 unfortunately, 4-7 won't work.
