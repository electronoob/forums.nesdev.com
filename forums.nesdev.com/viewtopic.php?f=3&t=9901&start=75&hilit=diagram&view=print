I have a theory which may or may not make sense, but here it goes <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />.<br /><br />The pattern of behavior for the PPU is basically the following:<br /><br />dots: 0-64    = clear S-OAM<br />dots: 65-256 = fill S-OAM with data for next scanline.<br /><br />at the same time:<br /><br />dots 0-256 = render background and sprite pixels for the current scanline.<br /><br />But, as far as I understand that means that there is a possible conflict if this is done naively. If sprite 0's x position is say 32 pixels into the scanline, that means that its data will be overwritten with $FFs well before it is rendered, making it end up as garbage!<br /><br />My hypothesis is that the 4 pixel delay for rendering is enough to allow an algorithm (which I have not thought of the specifics yet) to avoid this conflict.<br /><br />Thoughts?</div><br /><br />Like tepples said, the contents of secondary OAM doesn't matter while sprite zero hit detection is taking place. There are eight internal sprite output units (my terminology - can't think of anything clearer <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />) that handle the actual sprite drawing - the secondary OAM is just a list of sprites with which to initialize them (during ticks 257-320).<br /><br />What I suspect is going on is that the first pixel leaves the shifters at h=2. The palette entry for the pixel then needs to be looked up, which takes another two ticks, so that the first pixel is drawn at h=4. (Sprite zero hit detection only needs to know whether the pattern bits are both zero, and so doesn't need the palette lookup.)<br /><br />Edit: &quot;Sprite drawing units&quot; would be a bit clearer. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

Shouldn't it be 1-256, 321-336?</div><br /><br />Bit busy with moving at the moment, but I'll leave a quick reply for now without double-checking stuff in Visual 2C02.<br /><br />When I say that the shift registers shift &quot;during&quot; a particular dot, I mean that the <em>effect</em> of the shift is seen at that dot (in the real thing there'd also be a short transition period at the beginning of the dot before things settle down). Dot 2 is the earliest tick where you see the shift registers shift, and dot 257 is the last tick. If you completely ignore transition delays (like the simulator usually does), I guess it would be most accurate to say that the shift registers shift <em>between</em> dot 1 and dot 2, etc.<br /><br />Suggestions for how things could be rephrased to be less ambiguous would be welcome. I'm primarily a SW guy, so it's possible that I'm missing some standard terminology.<br /><br />(Note that the above usage is consistent with things being loaded or cleared &quot;at&quot; a particular dot meaning that they change at that dot, etc. Perhaps it would be clearer to use &quot;at&quot; instead of &quot;during&quot; for the shifts too.)
