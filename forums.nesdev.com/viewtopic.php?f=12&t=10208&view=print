G_0584.JPG</a><!-- m --><br /><br />It was the GB Flasher to SNES prototype I was working on.<br /><br />I'm a little older now, and more organized, less hackish, I want to potentially mass market a new SNES game. That's quite down the road though. Let me just ask my question.<br /><br />I was going to buy a TSOP flash to DIP package that I will placing into a pre-existing SNES cart that I gutted the ROM from. I plan on getting the TSOP shipped with Mario World ROM or some SNES ROM (without emulator header).<br /><br />My question is this: Is there anything that should be noted of the flash process? Is the ROM simply stored linearly into the flash chip? what about the ROM header, anything special with that? Or can I simply send a raw ROM to the gents and tell them to &quot;throw that on there&quot; <br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br />Bazz<br /><br />p.s. any insight at all helps!

The ROM image had better be exactly 1045876 bytes. That's why they're called ROM images, byte for every byte they're a 1:1 copy (an image).

Also, some games may have copier checks that will fail if the ROM is not mirrored.  The alternative would be to ground the upper address pins, then you wouldn't need to mirror the ROM.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Never leave an address line floating. If you can't find a small enough flash chip, ground the upper address lines.<br /><br />In the game itself, you could do what GBA games ended up doing: Just design the program to never look at the upper memory. For example, a 4 Mbit LoROM would look at only $008000-$0FFFFF or $808000-$80FFFF (for fast ROM). That's why, for example, most GBA games could still work after being &quot;trimmed&quot; to less than a power of two and put in a flash multicart. To be sure, put an emulator breakpoint on memory areas you're not using.

Address lines and CMOS inputs are not designed to operate in that manner though.<br /><br />But there's something to it I'd say since how Nintendo came up with an elaborate mechanism on the original SNES that wouldn't allow you to remove a cart without turning off the console first.  That whole rig certainly wasn't cheap, so they must have seen some value in it.
