I'm using this to detect masking, but it fails to detect Castlevania 2's swamp for now.  I couldn't imagine making a moving platform 8 sprites wide with contiguous sprites that appear before any other sprite in the sprite table.

Reading again maybe that's what you want to do. I'd say good luck, hacking is a lot of work.<br /><br />&gt;All of these games would need to have their background rendering code heavily hacked. This would need to be done for each game individually, it can't be done at the emulator side.</em><br /><br />Sooooo... it's an individual process that involves a lot of modifying and hacking. I figured as much.<br /><br /><em>&gt;Even if you hacked game by game, there are certain things that would be hard to adapt. For example, what to about boss fights that happen in locked screens? Will there be invisible walls keeping sprites in the center of the screen or will they be able to use the extra space? What if the mechanics of the fights depend on the layout of the background?</em><br /><br />Yup. I wouldn't know what to choose between those two options. Well, if it's like falling off a platform, for example, the space would need to be extended on each side to accompany the fixed background?<br /><br /><em>&gt;Here is a thought. Is there any way to heuristically deduce that a sprite overflow is intentional or not? If its intentional then hide the sprites, if not, then show them. Obviously wouldn't work in all games, but is there a way that would work for many?</em><br /><br />That would be fantastic if it were possible.<br /><br /><em>&gt;I mean that enemies/objects tend to appear and disappear just before they enter the screen, new tiles for scrolling backgrounds can be done long before or just before the edge of the screen.

I would love to take a go at doing this if I had the know-how to do so.</div><br />If you wanna learn, this is not a bad starter project. There are plenty of game making tutorials out there!<br /><br />Start by learning the game's map format. Figure out where the map data is in the ROM and how to decode it. If this is too daunting for you, then just fine maps online and duplicate them in a form that is useful to you. This is the first step in making your HD port. Once you have a map that you can put on the screen, you're now free to make your view as wide as you like (i.e. 16:9).<br /><br />Now that you can view a level, start making the other things. Put in the main character. Give it gravity and collision with the world. Let the player move around in the game's natural way. Try to get the feel correct. If you're ambitious you can disassemble the game and try and duplicate its behaviour perfectly.<br /><br />By the time you've made it that far, the rest of it should come easier. Make enemies. Add sound effects, music, level transitions, scoring, tile and ending, etc. It's a lot of work to get all the way finished, but it can be quite satisfying.
