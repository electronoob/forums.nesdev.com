Hey thanks, it was the protruding edge or "lip," as you say, in both my NESs. I asked over at nintendoage as well and they said the same thing. Thanks! Now both my NES's are perfect. I knew there had to be something I was doing wrong! Now I can use those washers for something else. What, I don't know.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Tue Jan 05, 2010 7:52 am</p><hr />

Are you sure that you've placed the cart carrier correctly? It sounds like you don't have placed that little protruding edge on the front under the motherboard. Look at the first picture on this side:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/Projects/copynes/asm2.html">http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/Project ... /asm2.html</a><!-- m --><br />See how that edge near the spring that "locks" the carrier down goes under (over?) the board.<br /><br />I accidently did this one time and got the same effect that you describe. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=109">Kinopio</a> — Mon Jan 04, 2010 11:15 pm</p><hr />

One thing that comes to mind is that the screws holding down the connector are 2 different lengths, are you sure you put them in the right place?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Jan 04, 2010 8:07 pm</p><hr />

Well that's helpful. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I was hoping to find others who had the same problem. This evening, I took apart the 2nd nintendo I installed a 72 pin connector in. I tried replacing the 72 pin connector temporarily with the one it originally had, but to no avail. When I slide on the 72 pin connector, it makes the cart carrier "angle up" slightly. When you screw down the front part of it, it bows out, and then you can't close the outer casing properly. So my solution is to just leave the front screws of the cart carrier loose so it doesn't bow out, and then allow the outer casing to be loose also, using those washers I mentioned. I studied and studied everything I could have possibly done wrong, but I was careful to make sure every screw was in the same place it originally was. There must just be something subtle I missed but I haven't yet discovered what that is.<br /><br />So I mean, I have a pretty good solution to this issue, but it isn't ideal. It'd be nice to get everything screwed together all flush and perfect like when it came out of the factory, but I just can't seem to get it to work that way.<br /><br />I did notice however that the 72 pin connector from my original NES was actually shaped ever so slightly differently from one of the new ones I got. It made me wonder if different revisions of the NES actually had ever so slightly different form factors for the 72 pin connector so only people with NES's of a certain age would see the problem (probably younger NES's, I got mine in the mid 90's brand new).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Mon Jan 04, 2010 7:09 pm</p><hr />

I've installed two 72 pin connectors into two NES's thus far, and both work great. However, both cause the cart carrier (the push click part) to have to be loose on the front a little bit in order for the cart to push all the way down. In turn, this requires the outer casing to be loose. I haven't yet discovered anybody who has had this same experience, so I thought I'd ask here.<br /><br />My solution has been to buy 6 small rubber washers to place on the screw pilons in the outer plastic casing. This separates it just enough to keep the entire unit feeling solid but allow the cart to push and click into place.<br /><br />I thought maybe I just did a shoddy job the first time, but now that it has happened a second time (and I was careful this time) I thought there must be a reason why it warps the cart carrier. Has anyone else had this experience?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Sun Jan 03, 2010 3:51 pm</p><hr />
