The PPU output is high impedance and unable to drive any TV directly, the transistor is just a simple buffer to beef up the signal. The weak signal from PPU will pick up noise form address lines etc. particularly notable if you just press you finger against the video out and some digital I/O line... the signal is very weak.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3483">TmEE</a> — Wed Jun 01, 2011 3:06 am</p><hr />

I agree this thread is so messy. First there is so much conflicting info. Many people show how they did complicated things like adding an external amplification board or did a stereo mod or wathever. This is completely unecessarly - the video is already amplified just not impedence matched, and the NES was designed to be in mono.<br /><br />Removing the RF was a major pain for me, but I had to do it because it wasn't compatible with european RF standard so I had to AV mod it to get any sound.<br />The impedance was much higher than 75 ohm if you just remove the box so you also have to change the reistors so that the impedance matches.<br />I don't think there is ANY capacity/highpass-filter involved in the video. I guess the PPU already outputs the correct voltage amplitude, at an offset of -0.7 V to compensate the BJT transistor. The only reason the transistor is needed is for impedance matching. I guess it wasn't possible to make the DAC which is inside the PPU directly with an output as low as 75 ohm, this is just a guess though. Maybe connecting the PPU directly could even work hehe.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue May 31, 2011 1:11 pm</p><hr />

Until someone provides a replacement circuit (amplification board) that <strong>doesn't</strong> require pieces from a NES front-loader, like I said, most people aren't going to go through with this mod.  I also cease to understand why one has to "harvest parts from a front-loader"; I have a very hard time believing that replacement parts can't be purchased from numerous vendors.  If people know what the parts are, what they do, their specs, etc. then getting replacements shouldn't be a problem -- unless, of course, someone doesn't know what the specs are of the parts, which makes that amplification board questionable at best.  Make sense?<br /><br />Additionally, consider the fact that top-loading NES units are being sold on eBay for between US$200-500.  Ask yourself if you'd bother to mod something that expensive (at this point in time) when there's absolutely nothing concrete in said 11-page thread.  Yes, I see some sort of <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=35154#35154" class="postlink">horrible-god-awful "document"</a> that requires me to "open autorun.exe" -- good luck getting me to ever download or run some random executable like that.<br /><br />Furthermore, there are other posts -- <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=73759#73759" class="postlink">example 1</a>, <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=73777#73777" class="postlink">example 2</a>, <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=73778#73778" class="postlink">example 3</a> (be sure to see my <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=73812#73812" class="postlink">rebuttal points</a> to the design in example 3) -- which are newer/more recent and reference what appears to be an alternate amplification circuit.  But since I can't read circuit diagrams I can't determine if they require parts from a front-loading NES or not.<br /><br />So again: until something concrete/sane is written up, and well-documented in a commonly-used format (read: HTML or Wiki page with images/photos and diagrams, NOT some random executable), most people are not going to risk destroying their top-loader.<br /><br />In my opinion, what needs to happen is a merge of the two modifications: example 3 provides a circuit that apparently uses standard parts (read: you do not need to "harvest" anything from a front-loader), while examples 1/2 provide a wiring diagram that goes to composite (RCA) out.  Combine these two things and you end up with a circuit that uses standard parts which goes to a composite (RCA) out.  That is what people are looking for.<br /><br />Effectively what we have right now is a "very informative thread" (not really) that <a href="http://jdc.parodius.com/lj/apc-cable.gif" class="postlink">resembles this</a>.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Mon May 30, 2011 3:57 pm</p><hr />

As far as I know they only upgraded units that were sent in for repair and changed the motherboard to either the RF or AV interference free output. The RF upgraded board I have is the only one i've heard of, but that most likely because not many people take them apart if there aren't any annoying lines in the video output.<br />I've had units with really low and really high serial numbers and the upgraded RF mobo I have was not a high serial number unit. In fact the only difference i've seen is the 800 number sticker on the back, but most of the repaired units i've seen had a new sticker put over the old serial number sticker, usually a NN900...<br />I wrote all this up on my <a href="http://www.game-tech.us/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Nes/NES-101Intro" class="postlink">webpage</a>.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4082">akaviolence</a> — Fri May 27, 2011 7:22 pm</p><hr />

The 'VERY VERY rare' NES2 boards also have the same multi-out port as the SFC/SNES/N64. I'm pretty sure I've narrowed down the specific source of interference and exactly where its path brings it to cause the lines. As I said, when I'm positive, I'll post about it in detail.<br /><br />The lines shouldn't exist on a RetroDuo; but they have to come from the same source, else they wouldn't look the same.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Tue Jan 11, 2011 4:11 am</p><hr />

<strong>---<br />MOD EDIT: This discussion was split from <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7362" class="postlink">Retro duo Nes top loader vertical line issue</a><br />---</strong><br /><br />The problem in the nes2 was iirc interference from other parts of the board. This happend near the ppu's composite output and thus causes lines. Later nes2 boards (VERY VERY rare) fixed it by moving the ppu away from the interference.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3369">Jeroen</a> — Mon Jan 10, 2011 5:12 pm</p><hr />
