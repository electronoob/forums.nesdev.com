I got my game to work with a system where hit-detection is done 1 pixel later than before. Non-technically speaking, the snakes now have slightly more time to turn before it crashes into something. I think the control feels better now. After a deal of work, i also fixed up and improved other things. So i release version 1.2, this is a final one, no more polishing. (1.1 is the DreamEmulation version)<br />Oh, and the PAL release also.<br /><br />NTSC version:<br /><br /><a href="http://geocities.com/matrixz15/nn2_ntsc.zip" class="postlink">http://geocities.com/matrixz15/nn2_ntsc.zip</a><br /><br />PAL version:<br /><br /><a href="http://geocities.com/matrixz15/nn2_pal.zip" class="postlink">http://geocities.com/matrixz15/nn2_pal.zip</a><br /><br />I cant log into my elazulspad.net account right now, so there's geocities links temporarily.<br /><br />Complete list of changes from the initial release:<br /><br />Version 1.1<br /> * Crash Detection and Direction Turn is aliged 1 pixel later, like ideally<br /> * Vs. Draw Game doesnt say "Team Wins!" anymore<br /> * Switch hit flash effect<br /> * Screen no longer jumps at display enable (level start / switch draw)<br /> * Animations doesnt pause when snake is restored / crashes<br /> * Fixed problems if both players are waiting to be replaced in Vs. Mode<br /> * ScoreAdd processes unpaused at "Get Ready" blink<br /> * Improved font based on the old one<br />Version 1.2 final<br /> * Revisited hit-detection (AI / Crash-detect)<br /> * Score is reset at title screen (not hi-score)<br /> * Fixed replace hit-detect wait procedure<br /> * Fixed bugs when removing snake in replace state<br /> * Improved random generator - produced static values in rare cases<br /> * Fixed 2-Player BGM arrangement data<br /> * No "hacky" effect when player is replaced in 2P mode<br /> * Fixed status-bar palette bug from version 1.1<br /><br />I know this is a bump, but it should be harmless.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=30">Matrixz</a> — Wed Sep 07, 2005 2:57 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, the Aladdin was a cool idea.  But it seems kinda dated today, from when ROM strictly meant read-only.  I think a flashcart is a better continuation of what the Aladdin did best, which is lower reproduction costs for future games.  In fact, using Flash lowers that to the cost of perhaps a CD-R at the least.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Aug 14, 2005 8:28 pm</p><hr />

Aladdin Deck Enhancer looks like a FC to NES adapter except instead of passing through the CHR bus, it contains an 8 KB CHR RAM. Something like the Aladdin Deck Enhancer means we'd be limited to the functionality of UOROM (iNES #2), but as a start, that might not necessarily be a bad thing.<br /><br />Here's a <em>really</em> oddball idea: make something like the Aladdin Deck Enhancer mixed with the GB Bridge. It would take NES ROMs stored on a readily available GBA flash cart and translate between NES PRG bus protocol (8-bit data bus and 16-bit address bus at 5V) and GBA cart bus protocol (24-bit address bus muxed with a 16-bit data bus at 3.3V). This translation would probably need a few latches and level converters, but I'm sure it could be done within the timing requirements of both the NES CPU and the GBA cart.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Aug 14, 2005 9:42 am</p><hr />

This might sound totally nuts, but why not bring back the Aladdin Deck Enhancer?  If it is too rare, then clones could be made of it using lockout chips from very common carts.  This seems to make the most sense, as it factors out the lockout chip and mapper:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nesplayer.com/features/aladdin/aladdin.htm">http://www.nesplayer.com/features/aladdin/aladdin.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The cost of individual homebrew manufacturering would be minimized as there isn't much plastic involved in the small shell, and the PCB is tiny and simplistic.  There would be more upfront cost for the enhancer though because it needs a cart socket in addition to a custom plastic shell.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=94">Jagasian</a> — Sun Aug 14, 2005 8:33 am</p><hr />
