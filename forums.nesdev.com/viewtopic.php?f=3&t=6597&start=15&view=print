<br />
<br />I just busted out my Apple IIGS and wrote some code that confirms what I've said.  I'll have to record a video of myself typing in the program + explaining what's going on (since I don't have a video capture card and I don't want to use an emulator for testing my claims), but it basically rejects tepples' "don't try it in production code" statement.  However, I don't have a way of forcing a hardware IRQ on the IIGS (at least none that I know of), so I can't test that claim.  But I *can* verify what gets pushed onto the stack (status register-wise) when BRK is executed.  Apple II buffs will appreciate this for sure.
<br />
<br />EDIT: If someone knows of a way to generate a hardware IRQ (such as touching a wire from something to a specific pin on the IIGS CPU), let me know.

If you had lots of system calls in a program, BRK could reduce its size considerably. Maybe some scripting system or something. And of course there's the use on PROM where you can always set a byte to zero. I believe some NES games use BRK as well.

<br />Yes, this is putting it quite nicely. SOMETHING gets pushed to stack, but it's not a Flag in the same sense as Carry, for instance. It is the signal called D1x1 on that big schematic. There is no provision (or need) for software to set, clear or restore D1x1.
<br />
<br />We're discussing this matter in <a href="http://forum.6502.org/viewtopic.php?t=1634&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0" class="postlink">a thread</a> over on 6502.org. We start on a closely related topic and end up discussing <strong>nitty gritty details of interrupts</strong> (including BRK), at the schematic level.
<br />
<br />As for D1x1, maybe I shouldn't try to summarize this, but here goes. If I botch the summary you can still refer to the actual discussion!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> 
<br />
<br />A 6502 hardware interrupt works by forcing the Instruction Register to all zeroes: ie, the BRK opcode. But BRK invoked in this fashion (IRQ, NMI) needs to execute slightly differently than the software version of BRK that we're already familiar with. D1x1 is what causes the difference; ie, it distinguishes $00 caused by software from $00 caused by hardware. D1x1 comes from a flip-flop that's set throughout the instruction cycle during which a hardware-induced BRK (ie, interrupt) executes. It is also the bit (yes, bit 4!!) that gets pushed to the stack in the Flags byte.
<br />
<br /> Maybe this will help shed some light. If it simply duplicates info already present here on NESDEV then I apologize; I'm a new member here.
<br />
<br />regards to all you 6502 fellows,
<br />
<br /> Jeff

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's interesting how it does interrupts. Reminds me of how most mechanisms in biological systems work, where one thing is re-used to do something else similar, because it uses less wetware. The 6502 is very much like this all over, as I understand it, and was one reason it was so thrifty on transistors in comparison to other processors at the time. Was the reason for the so-called hardware bugs, for example JMP ($01FF) or LDA $FF,X where X is non-zero, which were really intentional tradeoffs made to reduce cycle count of instructions and use less hardware.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />hiya, hijacking this thread a bit, since it wouldn't make much sense creating a new one.
<br />
<br />If I run blarggs' instr_test-v2/official.nes I pass all tests successfully,
<br />
<br />however, whenever I run the stand-alone ROMs (with a few exceptions) my CPU goes in to an invalid state when the program jumps to 0x03A0. This address is frequently used by the test(s) and all prior jumps work out fine. But somehow the wrong value gets stored there somewhere along the way. 
<br />
<br />I've been tracing my log versus a valid log (fceux) for days now, without making any real progress. From what I've seen in the log, my emu spends a lot more time waiting for $2002.7 to be set. could this NMI-missing be the culprit? (my PPU is not really accurate). Do these stand-alone ROMs contain any "illegal" opcodes?
<br />
<br />
<br />if not, this indicates a pretty serious flaw in my CPU implementation...
<br />
<br />
<br />I've yet to see a game that fails in a similar fashion, though.
<br />
<br />any help would be much appreciated.

<br />
<br />When I run official_only.nes  (v2) , I can see by examining memory $6000 that it says 13-rti passed, but then things freak out encountering opcode FF at A231 over and over.
<br />
<br />When I run the individual test rom singles I can run successfully roms 1,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 (I cannot run 2-8 since I dont have all the undocumented opcodes working yet. I've started adding the undocumented opcodes so I can run all the singles.)
<br />
<br />I am also unable to run the official_only.nes in fceux or nintendulator, which makes me think that since I can run it, maybe my MMC1 mapper is different (and likely wrong) which is why the ROM lets me partially run for a while.

<br />can someone please tell me where i can find this test, i need all the cpu instruction tests i can get since i think my emu still has cpu problems after passing kevtris's nestest.nes
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />okay after searching these forums i found someone linked this page:

<br />i assume instr_test on that page is blargg's test the OP is talking about.
<br />so finally found it xD
