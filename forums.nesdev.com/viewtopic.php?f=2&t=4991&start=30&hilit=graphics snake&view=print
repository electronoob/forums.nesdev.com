CNROM seems to suit my needs for the time being, but when I feel better about my coding (and maybe even plan things ahead of time a bit better), I'm sure I will go ahead and venture that way hehe
<br />
<br />If someone wants to REALLY limit themselves, there is always the minigame compo. I feel like I pulled off a decently fun game for being limited to 4k, so anything is possible really. I mean hell, Memblers pulled off a 1023 byte game, and I'm not lying when I tell you that my son and I have a blast playing that game two-players haha Button mashing goodness ; )
<br />
<br />So, the way I see it, if you want to challenge yourself, limit yourself to the extreme, otherwise, do as you please.

<br />
<br />There's a game as enjoyable/fun/good looking as say, Battletoads on Atari 2600?
<br />
<br />I personally find the Atari to be so limited that games really aren't that fun on it. Pitfall! is a miracle (basically the equivalent to, if not superior than SMB1's condensation) but I don't enjoy it as much as I could. Honestly, if they had another 4k to work with that would be great.
<br />
<br />And I don't agree with the argument that SMB1 is a special case and we can't replicate that. True, it's an extraordinary display of compression, but your muscles are capable of moving in a manner that would type that same code, so you <em>can</em> do something similar in terms of compression. But it's true, this is basically the only NROM game that did anything that impressive, and there comes a point where you can't do anything else.
<br />
<br />I like to think, what would someone who has a NES really like to see? Someone who doesn't have an SNES or anything else; what would they like to see? Well, I know they don't want to see anything boring like Lunar Pool or the other NROM games; not even another SMB1. They want to see something with good <span class="posthilit">graphics</span>, sound, and gameplay. Something that's not so limited/repetitive. I can take this MMC3 board which allows for more PRG space and a scanline counter; that, I could really work with. The only thing is that it -has- to be for the NES. The rest is up to me.
<br />
<br />Most of us do NESDev to see what the <em>NES</em> can do. That's the one thing that we don't expand on/change. We all love our NES, and we don't want to move away from the system itself. That's why we come up with all these things to improve the quality of games we make on the NES. And it's a fact: certain things cannot be done with NROM that can be done with other mappers. A powerful mapper <em>does</em> improve the <em>possibilities</em> in terms of overall quality for a NES game. It does not improve the quality by itself.
<br />
<br />I do find this argument rather thought-provoking. It does make sense to ask: why develop with super mappers when you can just develop for a more powerful system? Doesn't that take the fun/point away? But the answer is: because we love the NES.

<br />It's very similar with Apple, whose products distinguish themselves in the subtle refinements of their designs. Other companies make mp3 players that look similar, but subtle elements are left out. For a sidescroller, perhaps the single biggest thing that affects the feel of the game is the physics of the jump. Even within Nintendo games, a Mario jump is very different from a Samus jump (especially Super Metroid), where Mario is much more constrained by momentum.

<br />But there's still no reason to prevent those that can program good jumps from also using background animations, more detailed sprites and an occasional parallax effect. A good community mapper would give homebrew programmers all the possibilities.
<br />
<br />I think that the programming of a game is mostly mapper-independent. No mapper will do your physics for you, or the scrolling engine, or anything else. Sure, having extra RAM or ROM might have an impact on how you design the code, but the logic will be basically the same with or without a mapper. Mappers simply allow you to polish things up a bit, something that shouldn't be frowned upon. The NES is still doing all the work.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay everyone seems on a NROM vs MMC5 debate here.
<br />Personally most of my favourite NES games (Castlevania, Mega Man 1-2, Contra, Dragon Warrior, Final Fantasy, Battletoads) uses mapper 1, 2 or 7, which uses some mapper, but not some extremely powerful mapper and managed to be absolutely awesome IMO.
<br />
<br />Sure I love Castlevania 3 and Just Breed which uses MMC5, and I like many games (SMB3 and Mega Man 3-6) using MMC3 pretty much, but they are <em>sequels</em> to games with simpler mappers.
<br />
<br />But if I were to nominate a "super mapper" to be available, I'd definitely vote for a MMC5 clone. It has everything, all bankswitching modes thinkable, <span class="posthilit">graphics</span> extansions, large amounts of SRAM and a fast multiplier. Everyone seems to think about the MMC3 but I think it's over-rater, altough it can allow smaller CHR bankswitching than the MMC1, and have a crappy scanline counter, it's about all it can do better than it. If you use CHR-RAM you don't want to worry about the former, and the scanline counter is really limiting, but it's true that in some case it would still be better than sprite zero hits if you are having more than one split point on your screen during gameplay. Also it lacks MMC1's 32kb PRG bankswitching and one-screen mirroring, which could be essential.
<br />
<br />Anyway it is pretty clear that the mapper have a strong influence on :
<br />- Amount of different <span class="posthilit">graphics</span>
<br />- Amount of levels and music present in the game
<br />- Whether or not you can save your game
<br />- The presence of on-boad SRAM can increase possibilities of the game engine
<br />
<br />The following elements are not affected by the mapper :
<br />- How detailed the <span class="posthilit">graphics</span> are drawn
<br />- How good your levels are
<br />- How good the music is
<br />- How fun it is to play the game
<br />
<br />Hironically, today the most advanced homebrew NES game ever made is NESnake 2 by Matrixz which uses NROM !! It has very great music, very good gameplay and is very fun. It does also have quite good <span class="posthilit">graphics</span> for a snaks game. It looks better than SMB in fact, but it doesn't make any sense to compare a <span class="posthilit">snake</span> game and a platformaer.
<br />
<br />Know why so many of us can't release a really great NES game ? We really are thinking too hard instead of just throwing creative ideas straight in a programm ! Everyone on this thread is thinking way too hard. I want's until I came here, but now I'm thinking too hard instead of acting.

<br />Lack of time, probably. I always see people saying how great NES programmers back at the time were, but there was nothing special about them. In fact, today we have more knowledge and better tools to make games better than they could. The big difference is that they were paid to do it, and invariably dedicated quite a few hours of each day to their projects. I have to squeeze a couple of hours at the end of the day whenever I can to work on my project, and that's why it's so hard to finish it.
<br />
<br />IMO, the difference in complexity between NROM games and mapped games (that are similar in gameplay) is negligible. You'll just spend more time generating data for the project with more CHR and PRG, but getting the basic engine working shouldn't take longer. It's simply not true that games running on simpler mappers are easier to make. It can in fact be the opposite, such as in cases where more ROM and RAM would allow you to store data in a more friendly way for your code, and without it you have to use tricks to achieve the same goal (do more with less).

<br />This is one thing.  For example, I'm lucky if I can even put 1h per day on my project.  These days, that hour is mostly taken for making my map editor and I can't wait that it can get out of the alpha stage. But once it will be stable enough to generate data, I may not have the time to make some crazy code to compress everything since I don't have the luxury of time.  
<br />
<br />The extra space may allow me to make a game without worrying too much about fitting everything in the smallest space possible.  Of course it may sound sloppy and I do agree with that but since I'm doing it for fun and today we don't have to worry about the cost of chips and everything: who cares?  My goal is to have fun making a nes game first and I'm more than happy with that.  If I can optimize it latter to fit in a smaller space then I will be even happier. And if this allow me to take a simpler mapper or even none then even better.

<br />A professional would do that 40 hours per week, but I'm glad if I do 2 or 3 in average, so we would take about 20 times more time to complete the project than a professional.
<br />
<br />But also each time you wonder which of the many possible way you'll handle something instead of just handling it the first way that comes to mind is lost.
