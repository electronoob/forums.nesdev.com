		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Often whenever I do any sort of work (which I've been getting a lot as of recent because spring break is coming up), as with many people, I like to listen to music, except unlike most people, it's almost always a video game soundtrack (because I'm a weirdo). One thing I thought about though, is that while I like a lot of PSG, FM, and even sample based video game music, there are only a handful of games from the PS1 and onward (excluding the N64) where I find the music good enough to be memorable. I don't know quite what it is, but the music just feels a lot &quot;weaker&quot;, and I know I'm not the only one who feels this way. There are, however, a few game soundtracks that do stand out to me as really good:<br /><br />Super Monkey Ball 1-2; the electronic instruments really sell me; it's so delightfully funky, but also kind of atmospheric somehow.<br /><br />F-Zero X; it's an N64 game, but if I'm not mistaken, the music is actually prerecorded (the music being mono would certainly suggest this). I think F-Zero GX is the better game overall, but the instrumentation can be pretty bad. (Like, wtf is this? <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObJePb8A53E#t=0m46s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObJePb8A53E#t=0m46s</a><!-- m -->)<br /><br />Super Smash Bros Melee; I don't typically like &quot;orchestrated&quot; music, but it's just done really well here. I think the synth and guitars are what do it for me.<br /><br />Splatoon (1); I could do without the garbled nonsense, but it's surprisingly hardcore; enough so that many of the songs lend themselves well to metal-covers (one of the songs is even called Metalopod). Splatoon 2's soundtrack, on the other hand, is a dumpster fire. <span style="font-size: 50%; line-height: normal">Much like the rest of the game, lol.</span><br /><br />Honorable mention to Burnout (1); It's of the most stress-inducing things you could ever listen to, whilst sounding cheesy as all hell.

In that case, Shadow of the Colossus has an amazing soundtrack.  I don't usually go for the overdone orchestral soundtracks that blight 21st-century gaming.<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you were hoping for CDs from the '80s, then as we said, TurboCD is for you, as well as others in the link that I posted.  Ys I-II, Monster Lair, Valis II -- these are from the '80s and are pretty good.

Most Gamecube games seem to have used a softsynth, but a significant number of Wii games stored audio in &quot;brstm&quot; files.<br /><br />I do like the &quot;soft piano Kirby covers&quot; that're present on Kirby's Epic Yarn.

Where did you find that most GameCube games actually mix the music? Most PS1 games didn't go through this effort, and they were only half the size. The GameCube even has 16MB of ram that was likely meant for storing music, as it's too slow for anything else.

Using dolphin to look for soundtracks in my own discs, roughly half seem to use pre-recorded audio and half don't.<br /><br />The GameCube hardware is claimed to support mixing 64 audio channels simultaneously, so I misspoke when I said <strong>soft</strong>synth. It's more like the SNES, PS1, and PS2.<br /><br />—<br /><br />If we're including indie games, I really enjoyed the Closure, Expand, and Valdis Story soundtracks.
