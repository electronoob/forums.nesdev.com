<br />Well if it's for small quantities anyways, it won't make such a big change.

<br />Oh and aren't 3D printers very expensive ? Maybe if you have one at your work anyways you could use it for stuff like that.

<br />
<br />If you buy a complete turn key professional unit they are very expensive.  I'm going to be building the reprap which is an open source design with most parts easily sourced.  If I do EVERYTHING myself and stay away from kits I should Be able build it for under $400.

Ideally you'd have a 4.7uF or 10uF cap where the power comes in to the board, and a 0.1uF cap near the power pins for every IC used.  It would always be good to put that on the board, even if you don't plan on building the cart with them.

<br />
<br />However, those are to compensate for the imperfection of the board, the lines resistance, inductance, cpacitance, etc.... If you don't put a capacitor near the power supply of the IC, the power supply will be noisy, and sometimes it can be so bad circuits stops to work altogether.
<br />This is especially important if you work in higher frequencies, such as the 5Mhz the PPU uses for it's bus acesses.

<br />
<br />Yeah I had similar confusion at one point.  Really it's all filtering, the issue is high frequency noise causing issues.  So the capacitance has to be low to short out the high freq noise to ground (filter).  Big caps are used more as a "reserve" to help maintain voltage.  Both big and small caps are helping to maintain smooth power supply to the IC in different manners.

<br />
<br />Usually it's 1 capcitor for every 2 chips on Nintendo boards. It's enough and cheaper than 1 per chip...

<br />
<br />Most games I own have 3 caps.  One big 22uF and two smaller ones don't let those resistor color banded components fool you, they're caps.  But yes every time I've tried they work just fine without any of them.

Consider that Nintendo was busy building a reputation for its products being so reliable they're Tonka Tough (see <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonkaTough" class="postlink">TV Tropes article</a>), especially after the recall of the first run of the Famicom.
