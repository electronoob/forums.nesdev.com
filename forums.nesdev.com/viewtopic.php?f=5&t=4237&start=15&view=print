<br />When I 1st bought the powerpak and ran into the RGB nes compatibility issue he said he would assist.  After the 2nd email he never wrote back. I have been as polite as I could be in every email.  I final solved the problem on my own as you can see in a post I started here.
<br />
<br />When it comes down to money he should be prompt. I at least got my item.
<br />If I did not I would really be pissed.
<br />I have had way better treatment from so so Chinese shops.
<br />
<br />He is a smart guy but his social skills suck.  If he is that over loaded with projects or personal things he should just say so, finish up what he started and take a break.. get laid, what ever helps.

<br />
<br />I am stunned that this happened. You should see how nice all of my messages have been. Not stunned that I never received the item I bought, but that he is deliberately ignoring me. For what reason?
<br />
<br />All of my messages to him were like this; I am a nice guy, I know first hand mistakes happen, that is a non-issue, I don't care about that. I just want to establish communication with you so that I can continue to buy more of your stuff.
<br />
<br />Communication is essential. But I guess I'm not privileged enough to actually communicate with him.
<br />
<br />Whatever, I'll wish him well, but must say this is what is know as being rude among gentlemen.
<br />
<br />You have to admire and respect with he does, there's no doubt. But there's no excuse for the absence of common courtesy.
<br />
<br />(I'm just being silly now, sorry. Just blowing off a little steam. I have no hard feelings.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If one is in business to make a profit, one wants to keep customers. If there is a competitor, then customers will choose whichever has better service/prices/etc. (competition). If there is none, one has a monopoly. If customers need the goods/services you provide, then they have no choice, and thus you have little incentive (profit-wise) to improve.
<br />
<br />The thing is, I don't think bunnyboy, kevtris, and others sell/sold NES-related products primarily for profit, so I don't think the above applies. In fact, I think they'd probably be happy to let someone else offer the same products, if it meant both better service and an opportunity for them to focus on NES development rather than having to run a business. The goal was for these things to be available to NES developers, and they are/were the only ones in the position to provide it.

<br />
<br />kevtris on the other hand this probably  true of him
<br />
<br />Naturally noboady wants there work stolen and have outhers profiting off there back wether or not they intend to do so themselfs or not so......

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The reason he didn't want neoflash or similair to rip him off. Is cause they tend to just steal hombrewers work and run with it. Specificly for  profit. Unlike people as bunny who just like doing it. (he probably wouldn't mind if someone made a replica as long as he didn't do it for profit and made his own thing (Not copy his totally)
<br />What I meant with my argument earlier is that it takes money to do this stuff so another "evil genius" is not likely to come by.

<br />So, that guy seems very strange... as most of you are trying to justify his position of ignoring customers. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
