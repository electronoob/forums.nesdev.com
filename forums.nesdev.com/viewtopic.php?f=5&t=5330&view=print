		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I decided to take the plunge and get my first famiclone today.  The Pocket boy FC-360 is a portable famiclone with a case design copied from the PSP.  It got a 2.5 inch color screen and can connect to a TV. The retail price is 5000 yen, which is more or less 50$ US.  
<br />
<br />Since I knew (even thought I didn't test any) that famiclone are crap, I was not expecting too much.  Once I arrived home, the first thing I did was to test has much game as I could.
<br />
<br />I general, most game were working, which I was suprised a little bit.  The sound was off for the square channel (must be the same bug as most famiclone) and some of the colors are off. For example, Mario skin color is more brownish, some blue of megaman are more greenish, etc.  In some game the color looks fine. In other case, they look like crap.
<br />
<br />Regarding the AV out, it works but it blurry, more than a famicom RF.  The color are better than the one seen on the LCD screen which seems to imply that the color issue is not only caused by the clone but the screen too. In my case, the AV quality was not an issue since I bought it for games on the go.
<br />
<br />More complicated mapper didn't work (VRC6), which was expected but some game like Seirei Lickle (Little samson) didn't boot. Most games that I threw at it booted (Ninja gaiden, double dragon 1/2/3, megman 1/2, olympus no tatakai, gun dec, contra, super mario 1/2/3, datsugoku, Top secret, Mitsu ga tooru etc). Even my own MMC3 dev cart with flash eprom was working, which I'm quite happy for testing on the go.
<br />
<br />Verdict. No great but not as bad as I expected.  Would I recommend it? Too early to tell since I don't know the failure rate of that thing.  If it was 30$, I would say yes.
<br />
<br />Good part:
<br />- It's cheap (price)
<br />- For now most game worked
<br />- Very light
<br />? You can use a GBA AC adapter for power
<br />
<br />Bad parts:
<br />- It's cheap (as in quality)
<br />- There is no head phone jack!
<br />- Already one dead pixel 
<br />- AAA batteries arg.. And 3 of them!
<br />

<br />
<br />One blog as more picture but all the publicity on the site is porn.. So if you have an issue with that, don't look at the link <a href="http://blog.livedoor.jp/geek/archives/50760322.html" class="postlink">here</a>.
<br />
<br />I now have a portable test machine.

<br />
<br />I'm not too knowledgeable about portable famicom but this model came out a few months ago in Akihabara if my memory is good. For my first trial, the compatibility seems good. Quality... that's hard to judge since I never tried the other portable clone.  It's very slim, almost same thickness as a famicom cartridge.  The control are average.
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />After cleaning some cartridges, some games started to work, other doesn't. So the compatibility is good for now.  The ones that didn't work could be because of the connector, who knows.

<br />You could just as well be reviewing the PokeFami. Everything you said is true for it too.
<br />
<br />The PokeFami however has a very strange thing going on when using the LCD. Whenever a game disables rendering, a colorful mess is seen on the display. This happens mostly between screens, when the whole screens needs to be redrawn, but also happens on sections of the screens that are disabled during gameplay. This doesn't happen when the TV is used for output. Does this happen with your clone too?
<br />
<br />This seems like a better choice than the PokeFami though, which is kinda big (fat, actually) for a portable system.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />- Heh, for years, I though the square sound output  would be the correct, since here in Brazil we had famiclones for sale. The official Nintendo came later, but it had a short life of business. When I listened the emulators output I though they were obviously wrong. ^_^;; Funny that the square wave "bug" is still up on present days.

I used it on the train today and it was fine. My only gripe is the no earphone jack (damn you! game without music are not game!..) and gamepad is not great (I'm very picky on that).  And now the AC adapter socket is already loose but I'm not really surprised.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Fx3 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> Funny that the square wave "bug" is still up on present days.</div>
<br />
<br />Since it doesn't make the machine fail, I don't think they will care to correct it. 
<br />
<br />It would be nice to have someday a good quality (by quality I mean frabrication) famiclone but I don't think it will ever happen.  Carts are becoming older and they tend to not work and it's not the fault of the famiclone in that case.  In the future, emulators may be the only way.  I'm getting interested in that new gadget now, the dingoo thing. Seems nice.
