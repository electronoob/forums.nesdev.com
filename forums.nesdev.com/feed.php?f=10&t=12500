With the MMC5, if you use 8x16 sprites you can use two whole pattern tables for sprites without interfering with BG (with other mappers you'd still need one pattern table, or at least part of it, for BG). So you can have 8 different banks switched in, probably as much as the number of object you'll show on screen at once. So you can have CHR-ROM and just switch banks in as needed to display your sprites dynamically, being able to show any sprite form the game anywhere with few limitations. Just Breed does exactly that. It's pretty amazing, with other mappers you cannot really do it that way.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Mar 18, 2015 1:20 am</p><hr />

Sorry that I came off as lazy. I'm currently busy with school, but I'm procrastinating and wishing to make a project XD I have a final school project with a microcontroller and a compiler that's too stupid to see difference between program memory and data memory and has internal errors (thanks to being free and made by volunteers). Heck, NES does it better! I was thinking if I could maybe use NES as an alternative to the project if it fails. ...which is an extra/alternative argument for me to why make an NES game XD plus, it's very interesting to see the little retro style console do awesome stuff.<br /><br />Anyways, I never mentioned bankswitching CHR-RAM anyway. I was just making sure that I can do this:<div class="quotetitle">8bitMicroGuy wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Alright. Which MMC5 cartridges have all 64KB of WRAM or at least 32KB AND a battery?<br />Do these 64KBs of RAM at 6000h-7FFFh interfere with the 8000h-9FFFh, A000h-BFFF and C000h-DFFF?<br />My configuration is this:<br />0x6000-0x7FFF = Minecraft World save data, must have as much Save RAM as possible!!!<br />0x8000-0x9FFF = RAM for saving processed sprites (e.g. player with or without an armor)<br />0xA000-0xBFFF = I don't know, if I'll need, I'll use this for something<br />0xC000-0xDFFF = PRG-ROM bank that keeps changing on demand; contains most of the game ROM.<br />0xE000-0xFFFF = Always the same PRG-ROM bank with context switching algorithms for interrupts, bankswitching functions, basic functions, math constants, etc.<br /></div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Even if you don't. It lets you take pages away from sprites or background and use them to for frames of animation somewhere else. Say ... 2 KiB of fixed background data, 2 KiB of fixed sprites, and the remaining 4 KiB (and two background slots) can be used for two different speeds of bankswitching four frames of animation of background tiles.<br /><br />It would be a different story if we didn't have 8×1KiB banking.<br /></div>Thanks. Well I was thinking that all newly allocated sprite animations are copypasted into CHR-RAM from PRG-ROM. Using that instead of bankswitching is good because imagine having a zombie from one bank, enderman from the second and villager from the third. It's impossible to have all 3 from different banks! But with copypasting, it's easier. Upon initializing an entity, I'll just have it wait 5 frames until all sprites are copypasted. I won't be copypasting each frame because that would take too much time per every single frame so instead, I'll just copypaste the whole (meta)sprite sheet of the entity which would only have some little unseen delay while the entity is being created; it will just appear on screen when it's ready.<br /><br />Players, however, would have constantly copypasting sprites per animation frame because the sprite sheet will be long and two players need to simultaneously have their sprites shown even from different banks. If I'd use 2 bank spaces for each character, I'd have just 2 banks left for other things; 3rd for the enemies and 4th for explosions and that just wouldn't be enough. I'd need 2 banks for enemies. That's why I'll be using the first bank for copypasting player sprites. Now, because the player sprites are to be processed; like if an armor is used or a transformation happens; I'm using a PRG-RAM bank just for them to stay there so that CHR-RAM bank can get them when needed.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">CHR Bank Space for Sprites 0: Constant CHR-RAM bank (no need for battery): Players, their items and dropped items<br />CHR Bank Space for Sprites 1, 2: Constant CHR-RAM bank (no need for battery): &quot;Heap&quot; for enemy sprites<br />CHR Bank Space for Sprites 3: Animationally switching CHR-ROM banks: Animated stuff, explosions, effects, floating score, etc.</div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6924">8bitMicroGuy</a> — Tue Mar 17, 2015 8:14 pm</p><hr />

Using &quot;SRAM&quot; for Save RAM is just completely wrong. SRAM is a well known and widely used acronym for Static RAM.<br /><br />Using SRAM is ambigious because there is many SRAM chips in the NES system and in the cartridges, PRG-RAM is more explicit you're talking about the one on the PRG bus of the cartridge, as opposed to CHR-RAM.<br /><br />And as you say there is many confusing terms, it's not your fault for being confused.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Mar 15, 2015 2:33 am</p><hr />

Part of your confusion probably stems from terminology (from what I can tell), and that's not your fault.<br /><br />What you are essentially wanting is &quot;battery-backed RAM&quot;.  Most cartridges implement the RAM part using SRAM (static RAM).  But colloquially people for a very long time have used the term &quot;SRAM&quot; to mean &quot;Save RAM&quot; (i.e. &quot;battery-backed RAM&quot;).  Welcome to why I hate acronyms and wish people would just say what they mean.  :-)<br /><br />But then further complication is added: throughout the Wiki (and some other documents) the term &quot;PRG-RAM&quot; is used to refer to &quot;RAM that's on the cartridge&quot; (usually wired to $6000-7FFF).  Whether or not that RAM is battery-backed or not depends on -- you guessed it -- if there's battery on the cart (historically a CR2032), powering the RAM even when the system is shut off.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Sat Mar 14, 2015 8:27 pm</p><hr />
