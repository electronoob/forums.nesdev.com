<br />
<br />Added search-and-replace functionality, renamed Find-in-Files to Search since it encompases more than just "find in files" now.
<br />
<br />Added support for Vaus Arkanoid controller.
<br />
<br />Added function-key shortcuts and menu options for emulator control (play, pause, step cpu, step ppu, reset).  Makes debugging easier.
<br />
<br />Fixed empty-path problem when creating a new project.
<br />
<br />Added search bar hooks to Graphics Bank editor.
<br />
<br />I did not add functionality to tell you whether or not you have an appropriate version of CC65 toolchain installed as I realized this would lead me down a quagmire of version string management of packages that are beyond my control.  There really isn't an "inappropriate" version because even an old CC65 will work it just won't give you source level debug capability.

<br />I think that as long as the user is at least aware which version NESICIDE is using, by printing the version during the build for example, it should help.

<br />
<br />I used to force the outputting of version strings but weirdly they come out on stderr which I had defaulted to the color RED in the output.  Not wanting to see RED in his build output if there wasn't any errors, someone <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /> mentioned just not including the version information.  If you want you can add -V to the "Additional options" fields in the linker and assembler tabs of the project properties.  That will give you the version information during the build.

<br />
<br />That info doesn't jive with the info on the wiki.  Also, did you play with the Trim Pot settings (for the Vaus) in the Emulator Preferences?
<br />
<br />EDIT: Well you're right about the edges.  Cut-n-paste error on my part.  Fixed (and updated at the download location).  As for the range, you can play with the trim pot in the settings to adjust it.
<br />
<br />EDIT2: Oh, and thanks for the test ROM.  Would you mind if I add it to my git repository of <a href="http://gitorious.org/nesicide/nesicide/trees/master/test_roms" class="postlink">test ROMs</a>?

<br />
<br />That should have been fixed .... if you re-download the installer.  Let me know.  Sure I'll put the source in there too if you provide it.

Anyone with a paddle and a powerpak/NROM-128 dev cart up for testing this?

<br />That's the page I was getting my paddle info from...I implemented the trim pot.

<br />
<br />I don't know it made perfect sense to me...the paddle pot range is reported in $A0 steps (160 steps).  At minimum trim the pot range is $0D to $AD (which is again $A0 distinct steps).  At maximum trim, $5C-$FC, again, $A0 distinct steps.
<br />
<br />There is of course the distinct possibility that the information on that page is wrong and thus both mine and other emulator's implementations are wrong.
<br />
<br />What do you do with the paddle other than write test ROMs?  Are you working on a game that uses it?

<br />Seems to work fairly well, I guess I'll pat myself on the back and declare Vaus emulated.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Thanks for the challenge.
