Yeah, the assembler you pick is kinda like the mapper you pick: its quality doesn't dictate the quality of the software. Some people can do a lot with very little and others can't do shit no matter how much they have.<br /><br />The truth is that in the end a game is just a sequence of bytes. The tools used to generate that sequence of bytes will vary from people to people, each one will use whatever they are more comfortable with. There is really no limit to what each assembler can do, it's the person making the game that has limitations. I for example can't seem to figure out how to configure the professional assemblers, much like I'm not able to make a game using an hex editor, but maybe some prodigy kid out there can make a game by just typing raw opcodes...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Jul 12, 2010 10:25 pm</p><hr />

Yes, if you don't understand the features they won't do much for you in the end. So it all ends to a matter of preference and goals.  It's up to the programmer to decide if the tool is adequate to the project he's working on.  <br /><br />For big projects, I see (personally) a lot of potential in ca65. For small quick test, I would like to see what asm6 can do someday.  But some big projects were made in nesasm so in the end, it doesn't means much <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  All lies in the end of the programmer that is ready to invest time in the tool he's using.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Mon Jul 12, 2010 9:59 pm</p><hr />

What good is that if you don't understand what's going on? I imagine that if a person can't do that on their own they'll hardly make use of the wonderful features you guys are talking about.

STA (Pointer, X) will add X to Pointer (as opposed to the value <strong>at</strong> Pointer, like happens with STA (Pointer), Y) in order to get the actual pointer, which means X is not indexing <strong>data</strong>, it's indexing <strong>pointers</strong>.

Actually I think this is the least used addressing mode of the 6502, it's not very useful.<br /><br />Do you really need a pointer for outputting the decompressed data? I mean, it's understandable that you use a pointer for reading the data, since maps can be scattered across the whole ROM, but often we have a specific area in RAM where they are decompressed to, and this area is up to 256 bytes large you can use absolute indexed addressing (STA Map, X), no need for pointers.<br /><br />If you actually need to use a pointer (which is the case if your maps can be decompressed to an area larger than 256 bytes), you'll have to use Y. And since Y is also used for reading, you'll have to constantly save and load Y in order to use it for both reading and writing.<br /><br />The only other way I can think of is if you keep X as 0 when doing STA (Pointer, X) and increment the low byte of Pointer instead of incrementing X. If X is always 0 when these write occur, it will not make a difference when added to the pointer.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Jul 12, 2010 6:13 pm</p><hr />

I dont know the exact syntax of this wrt NESASM.<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: cyan">**************<br />DecompressRLE:<br />;**************<br /> LDX  #$00<br /> STX  mapBuffPtr<br /> LDY  #$00                 <br />RLENxt:<br /> LDA  [mapPtr2],y<br /> BMI  RLInit               <br /> LDX  mapBuffPtr        <br /> BEQ  DecompRLEExit  <br /> <strong>STA  [mapPtr1,x]</strong>        <br /> INX<br /> JMP  RLRepeat<br />RLInit:<br /> AND  #%01111111   <br /> CLC<br /> ADC  mapBuffPtr<br /> STA  targetPos         <br /> INY               <br /> LDA  [mapPtr2],y     <br /> LDX  mapBuffPtr      <br />RLLoop:<br /> <strong>STA  [mapPtr1,x]</strong><br /> INX<br /> CPX  targetPos<br /> BNE  RLLoop<br />RLRepeat: <br /> CPX #$00               <br /> BEQ  DecompRLEExit<br /> STX  mapBuffPtr       <br /> INY                         <br /> JMP  RLENxt<br />DecompRLEExit:<br /> RTS</span><br /></div><br /><br />EDIT: Okay, the docs I found online are flat out wrong (thanks again GBAGuy!  Sheesh...), so I found the <a href="http://www.magicengine.com/mkit/" class="postlink">official site for NESASM</a> (it's part of MagicKit) and read the docs.  DOC\NES\CPU_INST.TXT states:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">    Operand syntax<br />    --------------<br />        A        accumulator<br />        #i       immediate<br />        &lt;n       zero page<br />        &lt;n,X     zero page indexed by X<br />        &lt;n,Y     zero page indexed by Y<br />        &#91;n&#93;      indirect &#40;*&#41;<br />        &#91;n,X&#93;    indirect pre-indexed by X &#40;*&#41;<br />        &#91;n&#93;,Y    indirect zero page post-indexed by Y<br />        r        relative<br />        n        absolute<br />        n,X      absolute indexed by X<br />        n,Y      absolute indexed by Y<br /><br />        &#40;*&#41; can be zero page or absolute<br /></div><br /><br />This syntax is a joke.  This assembler is also 10 years old.  Let's hear it for DOS.<br /><br />I would recommend getting rid of this assembler entirely.  Peruse the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Tools" class="postlink">relevant section of the nesdev Wiki</a> to find an alternate you like.  Matter of personal preference, but I can't stand cc65.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Mon Jul 12, 2010 9:23 am</p><hr />

Can somebody please point to me to a better assembler(download link  please). I have seen in a few posts that asm6 is better?? <br /><br />Cheers.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4104">Nadia</a> — Mon Jul 12, 2010 9:03 am</p><hr />
