Your code should be well structured enough to only write to $2005 and $2006 in pairs, so resetting the latch isn't really necessary. Acknowledging the NMI (another function of reading $2002) doesn't seem necessary either.<br /><br />In my Sonic game I am reading $2002 though. I need to extend the vertical blank by a few scanlines in order to have more time for video updates and to cover up scrolling glitches at the top of the screen. Since I want the top scanlines to be blanked in PAL consoles too, before enabling rendering I read $2002. If it's still in VBlank this means it's a PAL console (this is a pretty easy way to detect a PAL or NTSC console), so I wait some more (a lot more!) until the border is the same size as it would be on NTSC. Yeah, it sucks that all that time is wasted, but at least the frame is properly rendered in both types of consoles.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Nov 27, 2009 6:24 pm</p><hr />

Firstly, thanks for apologising -- sorry if I sounded pissed off (I wasn't that upset, just generally displeased and disappointed), but given the history I've had with the community, I guess my reaction was understandable (not the same thing as justified.  :-) )<br /><br />Equally as important, thanks for taking the time to explain to me the mistakes.  I really <strong>really</strong> appreciate it!  Getting an answer to something that's bugged me for 5-10 years is rad -- again, thanks!  :-)<br /><br />I spent a couple hours tonight looking through Parasyte's IPS patch.  He changed all the JSR references from a Square routine I called _ZEROBG, which did nothing other than:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">_ZEROBG:<br />        LDA #$00<br />        STA $2005<br />        STA $2005<br />        RTS<br /></div><br /><br />...to his own routine, which was:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">L_F810:<br />        LDA #%10001000<br />        STA $2000<br />        LDA #$00<br />        STA $2005<br />        STA $2005<br />        RTS<br /></div><br /><br />The $2000 modify sets NT=$2800, and enables NMI at start of VBLANK (I believe the game sets this itself much earlier when the ROM starts too).<br /><br />Sure enough, the intro appears to work in Nintendulator (the emulator which previously exhibited said graphical glitches which resembled that of what an actual NES showed).<br /><br />I took a look at the nesdev Wiki to not only remind myself of what the bits in $2000 did, but to see if there was something I was misunderstanding.  Sure enough, just as you stated...  :-)<br /><br />My routine was intended to set the X/Y offset of the screen to 0,0.  I thought setting PPUSCROLL ($2005) was enough -- nope, PPUCTRL ($2000) is also involved.  I had no idea.<br /><br />Your explanation of the problem (writing to $2006, then resetting $2005 to $00/00, but not adjusting $2000) makes perfect sense.  I can correlate it all with the Wiki too, which at this point is a godsend.<br /><br />I never took the time to look at the NMI routine -- I simply made the assumption Square would be using it.  That is absolutely my fault.  So let's talk a bit about that...<br /><br />When the ROM loads, the NMI vector is set to $0100.  By default NMI on VBLANK isn't enabled, and the code the RESET vector points to disables it too right off the bat (via $2000.7).  I'll have to go through the rest of the code (it's been 10 years!) and work out what goes where, since there's some mapper #1 (SNROM) PRG switching and so on.  It's not that I don't believe you, re: $FEAD, but I'd rather work it out for myself too.  :-)<br /><br />For a final time -- thank you so much for the explanation.  I think I'll spend some time this weekend re-implementing the entire intro (including use of NMI) and go from there.  If I have any questions I'll likely start a new post.

Sorry for writing the previous post in a rush I din't mean to be instulting or anything I just wrote it in a rush for some reason, I'll take more time to explain what went wrong as an apologize.<br /><br />$2002 polling isn't completely wrong, in the sense that a loop that wait for $2002.7 bit to be set WILL exit when a VBlank has started, but it won't always the <em>next</em> VBlank. So it will frequently miss VBlanks. For this small intro it's probably not a big deal, but the proper way is to rely on NMI.<br /><br />Square apparently likes to have a NMI routine that does nothing but return, and the game engine calls a routine that enable NMIs (via $2000.7) and does a endless jmp here. When a NMI happens, the programm discards the pushed adress / status register, and returns to the main game engine. (note that this is probably form the FDS bios, as Square's first games were FDS, and then they kept this system for their other games).<br /><br />So all you have to do for a "proper" NMI wait is call the routine I mention above, which is simpler than polling $2002 and more reliable, which in the case of FF2 is located at $fead. So just a jsr $fead will be like polling $2002 but more reliable.<br /><br /><br />About the name table problem, by writing to $2005 during NMI, you can only change the lower 8-bits of both horizontal and vertical scrolling. The 9th bit of both are the lowest 2 bits of $2000. Because the scrolling registers are also used to adress the PPU, when you write to $2006 in order to do VRAM updates, it overwrites the scroll completely, including the 9th bits.<br /><br />For that reason, a "complete" scroll initialisation in NMI should write twice to $2005 and to $2000.<br /><br />So the reason the into looks wrong is because it does $2006 writes, and then reset the lower bits of scroll via $2005, but don't write the proper nametable bits to $2000, so the wrong nametabl is "randomly" shown.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Nov 27, 2009 7:20 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Your intro have been fixed several times, including once by me, look at romhacking.net<br /></div><br /><br />This is the first I've ever heard of anyone fixing it.  Why hasn't anyone talked to me about it?  Yes, I'm incredibly hard to find, aren't I?  *sigh*<br /><br /><a href="http://www.romhacking.net/trans/139/" class="postlink">http://www.romhacking.net/trans/139/</a> mentions nothing of the problem, and the only reference I can find is <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/453/" class="postlink">here</a>.  Quoting the readme:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The patch for Final Fantasy 2 also fixes the intro so that it work on real hardware (it orininally had glitches in the intro), and make sure the mapper is effectively MMC1 not mapper 2 (it shouldn't hurt if it already way MMC1), because a mapper 2 hack distribution was (and still is) very common, and it's not possible to make a cart out of it. For this reason, it's not recommended applying the PAL fix patch before the english translation because it's not likely to work. But it should work with other translations in various european languages based on this english translation as well (there is plenty of them).<br /></div><br /><br />Your fix/patch is highly focused on re-working Square's code to work on PAL consoles, with the "added bonus" of "fixing my intro".<br /><br />EDIT: I did find another fix-up of some sort <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/149/" class="postlink">here</a>, released in 2006.  I don't know who Parasyte is or what was truly changed, other than what the readme says (which includes other changes as well).  I haven't looked at the IPS to work out the differences between what Demi released and what the patched version does.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The error was that you did writes to $2006 without writing a correct value to $2000, and the wrong nametable was shown when plalette fading, because only $2005 was reset. Another error was that you used $2002 polls to wait VBlank instead of using the reliable NMI waiting routine.<br /></div><br /><br />Let's expand on this, because none of the above helps me to the extent that it should.<br /><br />1) People seem to be intentionally forgetting that this intro was written in late 1997.  That means it was based on what the community (that included me at the time) knew 12 years ago.  Getting all in-my-face in 2008 is a little ironic, given that the console itself is from 1985 to begin with.  :-)<br /><br />2) You sound outright annoyed by my request; I read what you write and it gets translated into "tons of people have already fixed your fucked up code, you don't know shit, go away".  If I'm interpreting that correctly, wonderful -- I don't even know what to say to that, because I've already been down this road with the nesdev community in the past many times over.<br /><br />3) Since when do you have to write to $2000 before writing to $2006?  None of my intro code writes to $2000, and why should it?  I have a feeling this circles back to bits #1/#0 of the register (Name Table selection), but again, see Item #1.  Please expand on this.  Point me to thorough documentation.  I wouldn't ask for help if I knew what the problem was.<br /><br />4) Regarding "only $2005 was reset" -- same comment as #3.  This very likely relates to loopy's "skinny on NES scrolling", which further complicates matters.  I think I've already stated on this forum a few times now that all the explanations are highly cryptic and that something concise/easy to understand/examples needs to be written before people will truly understand such PPU details.  I'll also point out Item #1 again, which is when none of this information was available.<br /><br />5) Regarding polling $2002 for VBlank status -- yep, I do that, specifically monitoring D7 (VBlank status).  The code in question therefore becomes something like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">-   LDA $2002<br />    BPL -<br />    LDA #$3F<br />    STA $2006<br />    LDA #$09<br />    STA $2006<br />    ...further palette modifications &#40;writes to $2007&#41;...<br /></div><br /><br />Can you expand on what's wrong with this?<br /><br />The reason I wrote what I did was because I did not want to have to re-write Square's NMI routine -- given that VBlank lasts a certain number of cycles, I didn't want to risk screwing up their routine and making a mess of the actual game itself.  It's difficult enough working with cramped ROM space to begin with.<br /><br />I can see some mistakes based on what Disch has said in the past, specifically setting $2006 to whatever address first, then writing $0000 to $2005.  I say "mistakes" because I think the order you write to the registers affects how the PPU behaves internally (circling back to loopy's skinny on the PPU again, causing me to point out Item #1 again...)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Fri Nov 27, 2009 5:38 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I guess it's to make sure the BG color is the right one, and all games I've ever seen does this after changing the palette. Altough if you wrote the whole palette, the pointer should be at $3f20 which is a mirror of $3f00 so it should be allright.<br /></div><br /><br />Hmm... I have lots of questions about this.<br /><br />Not to hijack the thread for my own use, but -- is there anyone willing to sit down with me online (IRC, Live/MSN, AIM, Yahoo, ICQ, whatever) to assist me with actually fixing what's broken in my FF2e intro?  *looks complacently at Disch*  :-)<br /><br />I'm almost certain it's something to do with the $3F00/0000 stuff, in addition to resetting $2005 to $0000 (which I still don't understand, re: loopy's scrolling skinny).  The intro works fine on (most) emulators, but what happens on an actual NES is different; someone once recorded me a video of it, so I know exactly what it looks like.  I do have a ROM image that exhibits (visually) on emulators the exact same problem as the NES, so I'd be more than happy to send someone that as a test.  The issue only happens when the text fades in/out, indicating the issue is probably within my palette fade routine.<br /><br />Please let me know, either privately or in this thread.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Fri Nov 27, 2009 4:47 am</p><hr />
