For all <em>practical</em> purposes, windows is usually &quot;free-as-in-beer&quot; for a home computer because of the way it's sold.  That said, there are a few important places that it's not free, but linux is:<br /><br />1. Used computers. I've bought used computers with no legal windows license, or something ancient like XP. To get a modern OS on them, I'll use linux since I don't want to pay for a modern version of windows. <br /><br />2. Servers and VMs.  If I want to run some web service on a windows server, that's going to cost me money for the OS. I can run a linux server without paying for the OS.

C has no built in bool type, and on many C++ compilers the size of a bool is the same as an int, so the only gain from using bool is the type information, not storage size.<br /><br />Ref: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type#C,_C++,_Objective-C,_AWK" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type#C,_C++,_Objective-C,_AWK</a><br /><br />2. Most people would complain about using #define for constant values when unnecessary. #define has a whole host of potential unwanted side effects, and a const value has very few.<br /><br />Ref: <a href="https://www.baldengineer.com/const-vs-define-when-do-you-them-and-why.html" class="postlink">https://www.baldengineer.com/const-vs-define-when-do-you-them-and-why.html</a><br /><br />C++11 also offers <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constexpr" class="postlink">constexpr</a>, which can more strongly enforce &quot;compile time only&quot;, if you need it.

(stdbool.h)<br /><br />(Yes, I know you could use bitfields)<br /><br />Most computer architectures don't support direct addressing of individual bits as opposed to explicitly using longer constants to emulate the same behavior. At that point, it's faster to just the full word instead of whatever subset anyway.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Eh, I dunno. I'm of the opinion that you shouldn't learn just one programming language anyway. I know quite a few devs that are uncomfortable outside of their only language. (ex: Unity/C# or HTML/Javascript) Many of them consider C++ to be black magic even though they've never used it. I did a Global Game Jam game last weekend for NES, and it blew a few peoples minds that I wrote a dozen lines of assembly to handle music selection. Not that these are bad people, but don't be like that. :p<br /><br />Be ready to use Java if you are hired to work on Android, C# if it's for MS, Swift if it's Apple, C if it's for Linux, etc. (Yeah, I know there are overlaps and what about JS/Python/etc, I'm just sayin'...) The more adaptable you are, the more valuable you are. If you are learning a language, figure out what makes it unique, and it will make you a better programmer in other languages even if you don't like it.

Something that teachers love when they're under pressure to make their grades look like a bell curve.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sadly at the schools I went to in the UK wayyy back, no-one ever taught us how to program. Which was a shame but they did at least have the goodwill to give us access to the Basic family of things in secondary school (BBC Basic, QBasic and Visual Basic)<br /><br />No lessons as I said, but the I.T. rooms were always open during break times and were frequented by me and a few others a lot. <br /><br />At University much of the teaching was very hands-off so you'd just go and learn your own style through research and practice. My course wasn't strictly a programming course, more a mix of design and coding but you get the picture.<br /><br />Recently there's been a push for more visual programming langauges such as Scratch for kids around theage of 8 years old which is fine. It's an entryway into programming I guess, you can set up logic loops, etc which is cool. Very bare bones but a good starting point.

Kids start using tablets/phones when they're only 2 years old nowadays, and they're probably capable of doing much more advanced stuff by the time they're teenagers than the things I was doing when I had computer classes at that age.
