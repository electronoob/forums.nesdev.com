As ShaneM pointed out, there was an issue with springs being the wrong color on some worlds in my MMC3 version (related to the same problem with red piranha plants).

Dumping the ROMs isn't hard at all. But the only game I've seen was Mr Gimmick which had been slightly modified so it would not function on a normal FME-7 mapper. <br /><br />I'm not sure what you are &quot;fixing&quot; in Loopy's version.

So, instead of using his version, I used a pirate version to match the Retrousb version since the one without the titlescreen was closer to Retrousb's version to begin with. Neither of those has a World/Level select feature. Why not just use loopy's version as a base you ask? Well, because I'm also an SMB2J collector (both physical and ROMs), and I was lacking this dump. Well, I still am but I made it virtually identical. The thing is, Retrousb's ROMs are not so easy to dump and I hear it's near impossible, though I've never attempted.<br /><br />You've also discovered my secret project... I'm fixing loopy's version to make green springs on Worlds 2, 3 and 7! Apparently, he forgot to do those. --<strong><em>ShaneM</em></strong><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5262">ShaneM</a> — Fri Nov 21, 2014 11:36 am</p><hr />

EDIT: Oh yeah, I made it to start off with eight stars, too, on the titlescreen. (Though it was unnecessary, as A-D are playable on this version without needing stars.) I just added stars for the integrity of it.

I realize that Retrousb stopped making their SMB2J repro two years ago. It is sought after by gamers and collectors because it has a very unique function: A level/world select option. So I thought to myself, I'm a fan of the game and a collector, though I prefer the real deal FDS version, many gamers are being robbed by not having this gem and Ebay enthusiasts are taking advantage of this fact with prices. So since the game is discontinued and nobody has a ROM dump of it (including myself; also because of its strange mapper) I thought what if I hacked a common pirate version to remake it? So that's what I did! I made this for two reasons:<br /><br />1) To get this extinct item back into circulation<br />2) To complete my SMB2J ROM collection (yes, I own a physical Retrousb copy, which is how I was able to find the differences through gameplay)<br /><br />It is based on the version without the titlescreen. The ROM that was used as a base is called: &quot;Super Mario Bros 2 (Lost Levels) (Unl).nes&quot;. (Screenshot below.)<br /><br />It took me about 4 hours to hack everything to make it match. I'm glad I own a physical copy to be able to find key differences. Some were having green piranhas throughout the game, except upside down ones. MARIO/LUIGI names being replaced with SCORE on the status bar, being able to select World 9 with three lives (hard thing to pull off, heh). Fixing bunnyboy's 8-4 ERR. 01 message (the only real glitch fix I made in this version). Red colored springs throughout. That strange L:S symbol replacing the star on the Flagpole on non-X4 stages. So yeah...it matches the rarely sought after Retrousb version to its fullest. But this is the good part: I used a different ROM than the one they used (I think; not sure what bunnyboy used if even an NES ROM. From what I hear he put all relevant FDS hardware on the PCB). Though the gameplay is 100% identical to that version, I am 100% sure the code isn't. So go out there all you SMB2J lovers and make a repro of this version to your heart's desire. I ask that you just don't charge for it. I spent 4 or so hard hours working on this and I give it to you all freely. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> --<strong><em>ShaneM</em></strong>, ASM Master<br /><br />PS: With this, I now own every single SMB2J version, whether it be pirated, repro-ed, FDS or VC version. My collection totals to 18 different versions in total (minus hacks of this game, including mine). I'll post the names of all of them, soon. My question is, do you all think I should make a separate patch of this that fixes glitches, similar to my FDS SRAM verson (the one with SMB1 on Side A)? Would that be something sought after? <br /><br />DOWNLOAD: <span style="text-decoration: underline">SEE MY FINAL LAST POST</span><br /><br />Also, a link to the discontinued item: <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=31&amp;products_id=93" class="postlink">http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=31&amp;products_id=93</a><br />Original pirate ROM I used CRC16: 7F10<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5262">ShaneM</a> — Thu Nov 20, 2014 11:51 pm</p><hr />
