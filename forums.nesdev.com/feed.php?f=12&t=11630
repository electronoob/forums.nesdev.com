I think though that probably the real reason behind this argument is more the fact that the docs can be used to make <em>new</em> stuff (which Nintendo indeed wouldn't care about), and there isn't much point taking them down it to stop emulation of old games because, well, they're already emulated anyway (so the docs are really only useful for new stuff at this point).<br /><br />The real issue is that Nintendo is known to be extremely strict and will be willing to sue whenever given the chance.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4526">Sik</a> — Fri Sep 19, 2014 12:53 pm</p><hr />

Alright Koitsu<br /><br />I respect your opinion. And won't be one to wreck what you have going on here. You're right about the scent of money, and the &quot;fact finding&quot; that goes on pretrial, and that it would most likely be a Civil vs Criminal case. And that Civil cases are almost rigged to come to some sort of settlement that makes the defendant pay something.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4151">whicker</a> — Thu Sep 18, 2014 9:42 pm</p><hr />

I've brought this up before in another thread, but I'll mention it here:<br /><br />I don't believe for one second that because these are classic consoles from 20+ years ago (read: not being sold any more) that Nintendo doesn't care.  I ask folks to keep an open mind (I know I am), but hear me out:<br /><br />There was a period of time after the SNES's downfall (essentially with the release of the GameCube, *possibly* the N64 but I think that's still too soon) where there wasn't anything going on publicly (or within companies) involving classic consoles.  However, folks need to remember that with the GameCube and GBA, Nintendo released an officially classic games on them (Zelda 1/2 on the GC, and all those classic first-gen NES games on the GBA).  Emulation and classic games were starting to make a comeback then -- emulators were really ramping up, lots of people (including myself) pissed off with quality of 3D games and/or just didn't like 3D (also includes myself).<br /><br />What Nintendo (and not just them either) did was re-establish a socially proliferated form that those classic games and classic systems still play a very important role with regards to both their income (not literally any more, but indirectly) as well as their intellectual property.<br /><br />If you haven't noticed, it's still actively going on.  Things like the Virtual Console (I think it's called that?) and some other things on the 3DS as well.  They're *still* doing it, and it's not going to go away.<br /><br />So if someone tells you &quot;eh they don't care about classic consoles any more&quot;, IMO, think again.  And I can assure you that in a legal case (though I am not a lawyer) against someone who dispensed private/internal documentation from 20+ years ago, that point would be brought up as at least one justification point.<br /><br />No I don't think Nintendo (or other companies) have some kind of conspiracy theory going on (i.e. release classic console games on present console to retain IP ownership etc.) -- I think their focus is on the money and how that *does* make them money.  But in the United States, anything that makes money, when it comes to courts/legal cases, plays a huge role in the case.  &quot;Oh, so the person distributing 20+ year old stuff basically causes your company to lose money today?  Well then, that changes everything!&quot;<br /><br />Anyway that's the opinion I've held for quite some time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Thu Sep 18, 2014 9:18 pm</p><hr />

ugh.<br /><br />Nintendo police and their black helicopters in whisper mode.<br />No I think they're focused on their current-gen consoles and anything marketable. Best to leave that stuff alone. <br /><br />They've also opened up a lot about their past development process in the Iwata asks articles... and recently gotten slammed for it by some of their investors. And not for divulging secrets, but being in their opinion ineffective marketing. It's all about $$$. How can you cause Nintendo to lose money? That's what they're focused on.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4151">whicker</a> — Thu Sep 18, 2014 6:25 pm</p><hr />

No the site isn't a certain Chinese site starting with a B, but I'm certain you could find stuff there too.  ;)  (I guess my 4 years of Mandarin comes in handy once in a while...)<br /><br />And I doubt Nintendo would actually ask me *where*, I think they'd more likely just go through usual legal means and send C&amp;D or subpoena information from the site owner (WhoaMan) who wouldn't know jack squat (really) about any of it.  I mean what would they ask him for, the IPs of us all?  That doesn't really tell them anything about where the docs are or who hosts them -- but they ain't hosted here (I can assure you that, 100% honest).<br /><br />If they did bother me, I'd respond (at least first time around) something to the effect of &quot;Seriously?  They're available using Google, no joke.  Takes only a few minutes to find the site, then about 5-10 to find the actual part on the site that has the docs&quot; while following up with a call to my attorney just as a cover-your-ass procedure.  And it looks like they might have originated out of France anyway, not the US, but that's semi-speculative on my part from basic (read: stupid) forensics.<br /><br />Important thing is: none of it is hosted on the nesdev site, and nobody's provided links to anything publicly, so this thread so far is clean as a whistle aside from some of us saying &quot;sure, we've seen those docs&quot; -- but so have a ton of other people.  The issue is more of who &quot;hosts&quot; the docs and then using DMCA to take them down.  Like I said, they got third-party companies to do all that sleuthing work, so if they ever go digging, I'm sure they'll find 'em.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Wed Sep 17, 2014 11:59 pm</p><hr />

Ragnarokandroll,<br /><br />Hope you didn't get scared off.<br /><br /><br />Part 3 - SNES CPU data isn't out in the wild.<br />(talking about explanation of CPU Terminal functions, explanation of fuctions). Granted there are better opcode books directly available from the company in Irvine, CA that made the chip. However, the SNES CPU has some really obscure pins, typically not connected to anything or connected to ground, but it still would be nice to know those official pin names and functional description.<br /><br /><br />But like Koitsu asked, are there any dates on the pages or a document version?<br /><br />Also, do you have any additional appendixes?<br />What is available already (paraphrased) is:<br />A The video chip memory locations<br />B The main processor locations<br />C The sound chip<br />D and transferring to the sound chip.<br /><br /><br />Do you know what's often most valuable? Hand scrawled notes of frustration about a passage being wrong, or extra pages added in that don't look like the others. Any of that?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4151">whicker</a> — Tue Sep 16, 2014 5:52 pm</p><hr />

The information being discussed is already available in PDF format on a particular site.  I don't like &quot;publicly&quot; disclosing where that is because I'm certain the day Nintendo finds it it'll disappear.  The PDFs consist of two books: the first covers console behaviour/features, MMIO documentation, review of SPC700 (audio/sound) and its behaviour, a small overview of the CPU, and some general example code as well as official ROM submission sheets / compliance forms.  The 2nd covers the SA-1, the SuperFX, the DSP1, accessories (Mouse, Super Scope, MultiPlayer input, etc.), and that's about it (the TOC implies a little more, but it's missing -- someone either didn't have it, pages were damaged, or who knows).<br /><br />And I also have a printed hard-copy of documentation that alludes to what's been mentioned, including CPU opcodes and so on (which we already know -- nothing new/surprising here).  The PDFs don't have that.  So for me, a combination of the two is effective.<br /><br />The official documentation went through numerous revisions, and at some point was split into separate &quot;books&quot; (literally the cover pages say that).  Earlier documentation didn't have that -- it was just a gigantic tome.<br /><br />What really matters is what version/release date of the documentation is that you have.  Some releases (older) contained a datestamp on each page or every other page (I'd have to check -- my printed manual has this for example), while the PDF versions I mention have none of that, but have a copyright date as late as 1995.  To my knowledge the PDFs are the last version that were ever provided to dev companies.<br /><br />Finally, I'll state that I'm already out on a limb even stating any of this at all.  Nintendo got &quot;sensitive&quot; back in the 90s about my public-domain documentation (I've mentioned this before in a thread here, byuu was curious what all transpired I think) -- they sent me a legal notice of sorts.  It wasn't anything definitive like a C&amp;D, but more along the lines of &quot;you're treading on thin ice, we don't like this, choose wisely&quot;.  And while that was maybe 16-17 years ago, I'm certain my name coming up <strong>again</strong> would ring some bells with them.  If they ever bothered me, I'd give in and comply with whatever they demanded -- I am not in a position (especially health-wise) to withstand any kind of legal battle of any sort (because even if you win the battle in court, you're still financially destroyed for the rest of your life).<br /><br />I can assure you that public disclosure of their documentation would result in legal action <strong>period</strong>, assuming they can track you down (for example, if they read this thread, they would almost certainly subpoena the site owner (WhoaMan), and if I remember right he hosts this stuff at his workplace, and I can assure you that would not look good).  Nintendo, along with lots of other companies (Sega, Namco, Atari, etc.) hire third-party companies to do this kind of sleuthing (I've already seen it in action back when I ran Parodius and we got a takedown notice regarding a homebrew ROM with Pac-Man sprites in it).  They themselves don't even do the work, they just say &quot;go find the source of this&quot;, the companies go and do the heavy lifting, return the results, and legal departments do the rest.<br /><br />In short what I'm trying to say is: I'm glad you come bearing gifts, but doing so publicly probably isn't a wise idea.  The way documentation like this got distributed in the 90s was through underground means, and purely done via word-of-mouth or someone approaching a specific individual who they felt they could trust and would say &quot;I'd like to send you a three-ring binder of something you might find helpful&quot;, giving them an address, and magic things appear in the mail in a couple weeks.<br /><br />So, I guess along the same lines as what Nintendo effectively told me, I'll pass on to you: choose wisely.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Tue Sep 16, 2014 4:37 pm</p><hr />

It could happen that some anonymous person who happens to have the same docs happens to upload them somewhere. And once they're out there, there's no taking them back.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=80">thefox</a> — Mon Sep 15, 2014 8:35 pm</p><hr />

By the way, I don't want you to feel like I'm pushing you to release this stuff. I don't even have a dog in this fight, as I don't do SNES dev. I'm only offering my opinion on the severity of the risk you would be taking, which I think is rather low.<br /><br />Anyhow, I certainly find no fault in preferring zero risk to a non-zero risk in this case.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Mon Sep 15, 2014 8:30 pm</p><hr />
