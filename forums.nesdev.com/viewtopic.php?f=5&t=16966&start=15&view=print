Replace &quot;a dozen&quot; with &quot;occasional&quot; and there shouldn't be quite as much of a problem.</div><br />Doesn't matter. If people here said that your thread was a <em>little</em> bit spammy, but that it's alright if it's only occasional, then you would have a point.<br />But instead, your thread basically had a 100% approval rating, with people thanking you and defending you. So, why should it be a problem if I frequently post those useful and approved threads that people are so grateful for?<br /><br />That's like saying: &quot;Occasionally posting interesting newly found NES hardware quirks that help people understanding NES programming is alright, but doing it too often is not good.&quot;<br /><br />Or, the other way around: Saying that posting these kinds of threads too often is not good means that you admit that your thread does have a certain uselessness to it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">About ten years ago, we indeed had a problem with someone who would flood General Stuff with talk about his own psychological problems.</div><br />Well, as long as I don't actually repeat the same topic, but each thread is a completely new independent topic (one day I post an article about Coca Cola, the next day I post something about the influence of the hippie movement, the next day it's about cloud formations etc.), there shouldn't be an issue. Your thread was 100% defended and regarded as 0% unnecessary and clickbaity. So, what's the problem in posting 10 threads per week of 100% usefulness?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I had thought about mentioning that in my first post to the topic, but I just barely decided that it wasn't yet the ripest point in the discussion to mention it.</div><br />You didn't lack a ripe <em>discussion point</em>, you were lacking a whole <em>discussion</em> since your contribution consisted of nothing but posting an article with a little comment and then never intending to come back to the thread.<br /><br />There was literally zero reason to post this, other than the stupid pun regarding the word homebrew. If game homebrew was instead called &quot;self-cultivation&quot;, you would have never posted a beer thread.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Should it be made a rule of General Stuff that any thematic connection between an off-topic post and the overall NESdev topic ought to be disclosed in the first post of a topic?</div><br />You have a very strange way of perceiving things. This question sounds like the question a computer might ask.<br /><br />No, it's not necessary that these kind of things &quot;ought to be disclosed in the first post of a topic&quot;. Just use your common sense and write your thread titles in a way so that they actually represent what is talked about and don't write clickbait headlines like those moronic YouTube assholes, just to lure game developers into a thread that has nothing to do with game developing.<br /><br />That's like me saying:<br />&quot;Interested in getting a date? Here's how you should do it.&quot;<br /><br />And then:<br />var date = new System.DateTime(2014, 05, 27);<br /><br />And if not writing a clickbaity headline defeats the whole purpose of creating your thread in the first place (since you didn't want to inform about beer and simply wanted to use a lame pun), then <em>don't create the fucking thread</em> because in this case it's just <em>spam</em>.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I guess a second thing that led me to post this topic was frustration with my boss at my day job (Phil's Hobby Shop), who is so busy with the craft brewery that he just established and with which I am not involved (Hop River Brewing Company) that he has very little time left to attend to managing my programming work.</div><br />Sometimes I'm really perplexed at how your line of thought is:<br /><br />&quot;My boss is so busy with his stupid beer brewery, that I just <em>had</em> to post an article about how beer brewers were treated wrong by superstitious morons in the middle ages.&quot;<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<br />
	</div><br />And let's not ignore: You complain that your boss cares for his beer and not for your programs, yet you write a thread in a programming forum that sounds like it's about programming and then in the end it's just about beer.<br />Do you manage to see the irony in this?

Good luck!<br /><br />I asked you what you actually want, now that you've made your complaint, and your answer is that you want to create spam, but have been repressing it?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">DRW wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Don't pretend that you wouldn't be pissed if this stupid thread came from me instead of your beloved tepples.</div><br />I would have liked this thread coming from you, too. That's not pretending. The actual content was very interesting to me, and I ended up doing further reading on it and discussing it with several other friends.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">An entry by pubby to the most recent NESdev Compo. When <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&amp;t=17085" class="postlink">I suggested a more honest description</a> of his entry's premise for use in the multicart, other users supported pubby and his right to insist on a description of his entry that intentionally misleads players in service of a twist that occurs in the first minute of play. Once I realized the parallels between the Star Evil controversy and this very topic, I realized my own hypocrisy and questioned if I am still the best person to continue to maintain the Action 53 project.</div><br />I thought the &quot;homebrew&quot; joke was good enough for a thread to begin with, but then it got backed up with some really fascinating stuff. Honestly I can't think of a better way to title this thread, and don't think you've done anyone wrong by it.<br /><br />As for Star Evil, I also liked Pubby's joke, and wouldn't like to see it edited in a way that blunts its effectiveness.<br /><br />In a parallel train of thought, if you weren't already a mod, I wouldn't want to see this thread's topic title edited by a mod to appease DRW's complaint, and I feel the same about Pubby's game and lidnariq's complaint.

There just wasn't enought continued interest across enough members to sustain a lengthy conversation. It's as simple as that. I believe you make the mistake thinking that because it held no quality to you, it holds no quality whatsoever.<br /><br />You were misled by a thread title in the general forum. Sometimes i click on threads i think they might be interesting, but then find aren't (to me). Hardly a reason to bump an old thread to cause a ruckus, let alone using rude language/symbolism.<br /><br />Clickbait is frowned upon because its link leads you directly off-side to some ad farm, troll attempt, ploy, gossip, fake news, non-news, scam, or something of that magnitude. This was not the case here. Hence, the thread title is <em>harmless and not a problem</em>.

Nobody ever said that, so why do you even feel the need to bring this up here? <em>Your</em> thread title <em>alone</em> and the fact that it was posted on an NES <em>homebrew</em> forum was the clickbait.
