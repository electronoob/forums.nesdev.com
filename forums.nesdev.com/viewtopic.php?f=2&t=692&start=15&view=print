<br />I'd be happy for it to be added along. I'd be buying one copy since im a fan of all of this.

<br />Maybe you could make some minor customizations for the Garage Cart version of NeSnake2?  For example, different sound effects, music, color scheme, or title screen.  Just enough to make the Garage Cart version of it more collectible, as the ROM on the cart is different from the free one floating around the net.

I already have ideas of different themes.

<br />All those = only 4 for a Quest Game <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />I could simplify it down to 2, why not.

Maybe later editions can have different colored PCBs?  That seems to be a trendy thing in computer hardware and in mod-chips.

<br />
<br />Speaking of demos, if anyone has any I could put on here, that'd be cool too.  I already have some PAL-only stuff, so it could use something NTSC-flavoured.  Maybe I could repair the RTC demo or something.
<br />
<br />Matrixz:
<br />Cool, it'd be great to have nesnake on there.  Looks like I probably won't need the source since it uses all it's memory already, not much left to optimize.
<br />
<br />Jagasian:
<br />Yeah, the pcbs will be new.  They aren't made yet, I'm still doing the layout and other stuff.  Not sure what color I'll use, but yeah, changing it when a board is re-ordered is no problem (Midines is using yellow Squeedos now).
