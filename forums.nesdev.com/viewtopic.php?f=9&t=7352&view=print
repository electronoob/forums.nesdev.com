		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I want update the satellite with RF technology, but i'm not sure where to start. Does anyone know if its possible to just swap the IR communications with RF? My ultimate goal is wireless NES controllers, but this would be easier and quicker to achieve if its as easy as connect up a transmitter and reciever to the right traces inside the satellite components. Like <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=260711375468&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT" class="postlink">these</a> maybe.
<br />My thought is you can still use your favorite nes controller, just from about anywhere within your house.
<br />A battery upgrade would also be expected and easy to implement inside the satellite.

<br />
<br />For example:
<br />PIC16F628 (it has two internal clocks, so you won't need additional parts) on the controller, and another PIC (PIC16F877 clocked with NES CPU frequency, for example) on the NES to control both gamepads
<br />
<br />And remember that you should also implement a way to switch from RF to wired controllers, in case you want to use, for example, a NES zapper
<br />
<br />Or you can buy simply a NOAC that uses RF and mod it (I'm unsure if that exist, but you can try searching on the net)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If i'm thinking correctly I dont need controllers at all, they already exist in the satellite transmitter and reciever. Already pulled some datasheets for some of the chips in each module, trans has a tmp42c70 and the reciever has a tmp42c60p, both 4bit mirco-controllers. What i'm saying is the satellite already has "protocol" in place for communicating, I just want to change the method (from IR to RF) not the language it uses to communicate.
<br />I'm starting to wonder if those need to be dumped in order to be sure of what pins are used for data in/out. Maybe just retracing the IR LEDs traces will lead me to the right pin?

At worst, one of the two expects/produces modulated data and the other expects/produces demodulated data and you'll have to replace them anyway.

<br />Unless you bought the limited edition controllers that came in tins with the receivers, you couldn't use them with a regular NES.  The messiah has the receiver built in.  And since the console sucks, I wouldn't be willing to buy one just to tear it apart and see if the wireless component can be isolated from the main components.

<br />
<br />Keep us all posted dude! This would be an awesome mod for the FC with its 3ft cords, although P-II may be a b!tch (i.e. analogue mic signal).

<br />But the <a href="http://img220.imageshack.us/i/nexreciever1.jpg/" class="postlink">RF board</a> looks like a complete module supplied from someone else. The RF chip is nRF2401.
<br />Anyway, this won't help me with my project i'm afraid.
