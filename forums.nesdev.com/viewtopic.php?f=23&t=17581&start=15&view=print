The thing that had kept most people (if not everybody) from doing that is that the installation stuff relies on having a bunch of wires connected to parallel port (and with some more wires you could also upload software via cable, at speeds faster than wifi's 2Mbit/s).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">There is WiFiMe, usable with a FlashMe'd DS (to skip DS Download Play's RSA check). But I think that requires a USB WLAN adapter with a certain Ralink chipset.</div><br />Could be nice... if there are more than a few people having compatible WLAN adaptors. And I guess one would additionally need a flashcart or other hardware for patching the firmware's RSA check (unless there's a way around that, I guess could find exploits in rsa-signed games, or use the rsa-signed menu from demo stations).<br />Anyways, the thing that I am interested in would be transfer protocol. Is there any source code for WiFiMe? Or are there homebrew single-cart multiplayer NDS games? It would be nice to know how to make such games (though they would work only when patching the RSA check at receiver side), and it would be nice to implement the receiver side in DS Xboo firmware someday.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Apache Thunder wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Ok noticing a minor graphics issue when booting a cart via the cart loader.</div><br />Might be because I haven't cleared all vram and palette memory. I could have a look at supporting those flashcarts - if you could upload rom-images for the flashcart bootmenues somewhere.<br />I should probably also clear main ram and wram (though commercial games seem to do that themselves). But I don't like the idea of zerofilling 16Mbytes of memory. I guess something SwiCpuSet could be relative fast, and DMA might be a bit faster, probably clearing 4 bytes per clock cycle at 33MHz, so 16Mbytes would take 125ms, plus some more time for wram &amp; vram : /

You probably wouldn't need all of them)<br /><br />I can rom dump the Cyclo iEvolution but I bet it may be an issue with the game it's pretending to be while in TWL mode. Look to see if you have issues booting the Cooking Coach game it is pretending to be. If the real game works...not sure why the iEvo one wouldn't I could rom dump it but that wouldn't help It would just be the same one the real game uses. (it's exploit code is in the save file. I can probably dump that if you want it)<br /><br />I have the decrypted boot menu for iEVo too. I was able to boot the cart with that and skip loading the game. But it fails to boot any DSi Enhanced roms though. I think there's something the exploit code in the save file of the spoofed Cooking Coach rom may be setting up first maybe?<br /><br />Anyways the R4 works fine.<br /><br />I think you just need to clear VRAM/Palette data and it will be fine. Clearing main ram is probably not a good idea.. It would break the soft-reset data region some apps could use to make Launcher auto boot things.<br /><br />I've attached the rom dump of the DS-X below:<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Many thanks! I'll remove the unknown chip warning in next version. The picture is clear enough, in fact the resolution is a bit overkill, but the chip's part number is pretty well legible:<br />ST, NAND02G, AH0LZC5, HH563 8Y, KOR 99 935<br />Going by similar datasheets (for non-eMMC chips), the &quot;02G&quot; stands for 2 gigabit, and the next some letters should be package/temperature/voltage/bustype and the like.<br /><br />That ST chips appear to be quite rare. There've been only two people reporting the unknown eMMC warning message showing up in unlaunch; showing these values:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;AC XX XX XX XX 30 36 35&nbsp; ;\CID<br />&nbsp;32 43 4D 4D 4E 01 FE 00&nbsp; ;/<br />&nbsp;00 40 8A E0 BF FF 7F F5&nbsp; ;\CSD<br />&nbsp;80 59 0F 32 01 2F 90 00&nbsp; ;/<br />&nbsp;80 80 FF 80 00 04 00 00&nbsp; ;OCR etc ...<br />&nbsp;00 00 00 00 01 00 01 00<br />&nbsp;00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00<br />&nbsp;00 09 00 00 00 01 D0 40<br />&nbsp;00 00 01 00</div><br />The date code in first byte can be AC or BC (the one in the above photo has value AC), with C meaning year 1997+12=2009, and A/B meaning october/november. So it seems that nintendo has used that ST chips only for a short period, close to the launch of the DSi XL console (unless other people have ST chips with other datecodes).<br /><br />The differences in the CSD value translate to:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Samsung&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Samsung&nbsp; &nbsp; ST<br />&nbsp; bit&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;name&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; KMAPF0000M&nbsp; KLM5617EFW NAND02GAH0LZC5<br />&nbsp; 112-119 TAAC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 26h=1.5ms&nbsp; &nbsp;27h=15ms&nbsp; &nbsp;2Fh=20ms<br />&nbsp; 96-103&nbsp; TRAN_SPEED&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2Ah=20MHz&nbsp; &nbsp;32h=25MHz&nbsp; 32h=25MHz<br />&nbsp; 79&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; READ_BL_PARTIAL 0=No(?)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0=No(?)&nbsp; &nbsp; 1=Yes<br />&nbsp; 62-73&nbsp; &nbsp;C_SIZE&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 77Fh=240MB&nbsp; 77Fh=240MB 3D5h=245.5MB<br />&nbsp; 59-61&nbsp; &nbsp;VDD_R_CURR_MIN&nbsp; 6=60mA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6=60mA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7=100mA<br />&nbsp; 56-58&nbsp; &nbsp;VDD_R_CURR_MAX&nbsp; 6=80mA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6=80mA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7=200mA<br />&nbsp; 53-55&nbsp; &nbsp;VDD_W_CURR_MIN&nbsp; 6=60mA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6=60mA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7=100mA<br />&nbsp; 50-52&nbsp; &nbsp;VDD_W_CURR_MAX&nbsp; 6=80mA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6=80mA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7=200mA<br />&nbsp; 47-49&nbsp; &nbsp;C_SIZE_MULT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6=256&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6=256&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7=512<br />&nbsp; 42-46&nbsp; &nbsp;ERASE_GRP_SIZE&nbsp; 1Fh=32x32&nbsp; &nbsp;00h=1x32&nbsp; &nbsp;1Fh=32x32<br />&nbsp; 32-36&nbsp; &nbsp;WP_GRP_SIZE&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;09h=10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1Fh=32&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;00h=1<br />&nbsp; 26-28&nbsp; &nbsp;R2W_FACTOR&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 05h=32x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;03h=8x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;02h=4x<br />&nbsp; 14&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; COPY&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1=Copy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1=Copy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0=Original</div>

Filling the whole VRAM via STMIA opcodes takes around 6ms, which is more or less acceptable. Filling Main RAM is pretty slow, and timings depend on how it's done:<br />- 120us for filling 2Mbyte via STMIA opcodes (if destination is uncached)<br />- 54us for filling 2Mbyte via STMIA opcodes (if destination is cached-with-writebuffering)<br />- 49us for filling 2Mbyte via DMA transfers<br />So filling 16Mbytes (for DSi titles) would take about 400ms, and filling 4Mbytes (for NDS titles) would take 100ms. That's even slow than I had thought (parts because I forgot that main ram is using 16bit databus, not 32bit, and because there seems to be some further overload, maybe the hardware inserts extra cycles after each 16-byte snippet or so). Anyways, 400ms is too slow.<br /><br />The three different eMMC chips are now accepted without warning (but the warning is kept in there, in case some consoles have yet different chips).<br /><br />The unknown camera warning is also kept in there - but so far nobody has reported it being triggered, so it seems that nintendo has never used the unknown camera devices, and all consoles contain the same aptina cameras. But who knows, maybe some rare/early consoles have the unknown cameras in there.<br />Btw. speaking of those cameras, their initialization sequence is documented here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm#dsialternatecamerasfromunknownmanufacturer">http://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm#dsia ... nufacturer</a><!-- m --> does anybody know a camera/datasheet matching that sequence? Register [03h] is apparently some &quot;bank&quot; registers for accessing more than 256 registers, and there are other characteristic things like writing an array with 22 increasing numbers to [1:8Dh+(0..21)]. I guess anybody who has ever worked with that cameras will immediately recognize them.<br /><br />I could/should also add warnings about Chinese iQue DSi consoles having an &quot;unknown firmware&quot;, as well as early japanese ones with firmware v1.0 (assuming that that version did actually exist). Or, if somebody has already dumped such firmwares, please let me know. I would be mainly interesting in getting a filesystem tree with filenames, filesizes, and crc32's, for checking if there were different or completely missing system files on that consoles.

I think that probably this is still related to the fact that i cannot boot into system menu with versions after 0.8, interesting fact, i tried some old ones, and while the 0.6 works, the 0.7 has the same issue. Also i tested this version on my nand backup used with no$gba, and it works...</div><br />Yeah, my launcher patches did hang when loading firmware v1.4.5 in most unlaunch versions. That issue occured in v0.7 and v0.9-v1.1. But it should work okay in unlaunch v1.2. But you have got it installed, and it's showing the correct versions string for v1.2 (NOCASH UNLAUNCH.DSI V1.2) and just hangs there? Well, then that would be some different issue unrelated to the patches...<br /><br />You have made a eMMC from the non-working state, and that's working in no$gba? And you have the Reset/Startup Entrypoint option set to &quot;GBA/NDS BIOS&quot;, so it's showing the Unlaunch loading screen, and then boots into the official boot menu?<br /><br />If that's working then it seems to be more a hardware issue... I've tested unlaunch with both wifi board versions and they are both working okay. Different eMMC chips probably shouldn't cause problems (but I've only the KMAPF0000M-S998 one for testing). Uhm, or different Console IDs... that might be a problem if you have used a firmware from a different console (like trying to run a european firmware on a japanese console)?<br /><br />PS. The wifi issues... which games are affected by that? And are that NDS games or DSi(-enhanced) games? And do you know which DWM-W0xx wifi board version you have in the console?<br /><br />EDIT: Found a terrible mistake: Skipping wifi init was supposed to be done when pressing button Y, but I've somehow assigned it to button B, ie. the same button as for booting from ROM cartridge slot - so that should explain wifi issues for ROM cartridges.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The iEvo SRL I was able to manually rebuild to a version that System Menu can use. It loads arm9 to an address higher then the normal 0x2000000 so I was able to offset it to account for a blank secure area without issue. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> (By simply having load address 0x800 lower then entry address so the entry address is still at the original location)<br /><br />Anyways the cart doesn't even show the Cooking Coach boot logos. Just blackscreens. I guess not much can be done about it if you have the original game it's spoofing working. The cart is still going for $40+ on the one flashcart site that's still selling it so yeah it's still expensive to get. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />As for my DS-X. I did post the rom image for it in a previous reply. You must have missed it. Here's the link to it I had attached to that reply:<br /><br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/download/file.php?id=13190">download/file.php?id=13190</a><!-- l -->

As for the firmware, i didn't do nothing of those things, i only installed unlaunch via flipnote and that's all, i didn't modify my nand in other ways. I could send pics of my console if needed
