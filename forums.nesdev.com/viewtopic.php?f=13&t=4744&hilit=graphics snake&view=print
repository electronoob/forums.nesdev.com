<br />
<br />And even that is not an advertisement per se.  It's an achievement post; look what he accomplished, that's pretty cool, he posted it because some people were interested in news on how his game was going.  He didn't say "*NEW* FOR SALE BRAND NEW NES GAME NEVER BEFORE SEEN ONLY $29.99 MAKES GREAT GIFTS FOR THE WIFE AND KIDS.  ORDER NOW AND GET IT AUTOGRAPHED!"
<br />
<br />This thread is even less of that.
<br />
<br />We can get really, really picky with the rules too, but I don't think anyone wants to go there.  No pirated software?  There goes all source code discussion.  Somebody could compile the SMB disassembly and play it illegally.
<br />
<br />Bregalad you are generally a cool and helpful dude and I don't want to make you mad at me, because there are not a lot of regulars here and you guys are all very smart.  But I don't think we should be calling for someone's posts to be removed because they are showing off a game they're working on.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />

<br />
<br />I'm not sure that would fall under it... especially when you consider that the PowerPak is a very useful tool for development on the NES, whereas a commercial game, uh, isn't.

Also, it's really helpful to know when PowerPak is in stock. We should be able to talk about/show off new games we're making, because we all came here to make games and have other people play them. Probably no one will know about them unless we show them off here. So I think we should all just calm down and eat some fruit or something*.

How about Grand Theftendo, Neotoxin, maybe Time Conquest, if anyone remembers that one.  Those, and certainly most NES homebrew projects have something in common - they never get finished and released properly.  If releasing it on cart helps it get completed, then great.
<br />
<br />When I took a reserve list for Garage Cart #1, I don't think I even mentioned it here.  I knew noone here was making money doing NES development, so who'd have $35 to spend on that rather than any kind of dev tool?  It turned out to be a really good deal for the original buyers, but that's besides the point.
<br />
<br />Definitely it's not an ad, it's not for sale, it's not even done yet.  It's certainly interesting though.

<br />#1 - Yes, I do intend to put any and all games I make on real carts and actually sell them.  This game is no exception.  But in reality, I don't expect to make lots of money off this.  Any little cash I can make is certainly nice.
<br />
<br />#2 - This is hardly a commercial or ad.  It just showed some stuff in the game.  I want people to know what's being developed.  There's a long way to go before the end of this.
<br />
<br />#3 - I do very much hope to finish this.  I don't have any reason not to.
<br />
<br />#4 - The most important news:  Progress continues!  I'll be making a first boss battle soon.

<br />For some reason I missed that one (maybe because of the thread's name), but if I read it back then I would probably have complained as well.
<br />
<br />And yes it's really annoying to see people make money on what I take hours to do for free. And yes there is many unfinished projects but I can't complain as I haven't finished any of mines yet.
