A little fun nostalgic story concerning emulator development. I remember back in the late 90's me and my pal started to code on our NES emulator for AmigaOS. At this time there wasn't much techinfo available but rumours claimed this Y0Shi guy had his nestech.txt with all sorts of valuable information. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br />I contacted him but he declined to give me the info unless I had some kind of proof we were developing a NES emulator. I am not sure about the reason for this.. Anyway, we didn't have a properly working emulator at that time but when we had something working I got back to this guy and finally got access to the document. It was located on some sort of secret-server. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=353">oRBIT2002</a> — Fri Feb 27, 2015 5:21 am</p><hr />

The fact is that the textures on both the PlayStation and the N64 are the same size. I think the N64 one looks better because even though the textures are the same, the textures are smoothened, even if they are blurrier.

(mostly) It's kind of weird, but I think that the PlayStation had better looking games when the N64 came out, but I think the N64 eventually started beating the PlayStation late in its life. (Thanks to people like Rare and Factor 5.)<br /><br />Here's an article from Wikipedia about the N64 I feel like showing: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64_programming_characteristics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_6 ... cteristics</a><!-- m --><br /><div class="quotetitle">Wikipedia wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />SGI's default microcode for Nintendo 64 is called &quot;Fast3D&quot;, which some developers noted was poorly profiled for use in games. Although it allows more than 100,000 high accuracy polygons per second, this microcode is optimized more for accuracy than for speed, and performance may suffer as a result. Nintendo's own &quot;Turbo3D&quot; microcode allows 500,000–600,000 normal accuracy polygons per second. However, due to the graphical degradation, Nintendo officially discouraged its use. Several companies, such as Factor 5,[3] Boss Game Studios and Rare, were able to write custom microcode that reportedly runs their game engines better than SGI's standard microcode would<br /></div><br />I really don't care how &quot;bad&quot; the polygons look, If I had to choose between 100,000 or 500,000–600,000 polygons, you bet I'll go for the one that's got 5-6x as much, even if they are only &quot;normal accuracy&quot; (Whatever that even means.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tomaitheous wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />There are only a few games I can play from that generation because of this (and yet NES graphics look beautiful to me).<br /></div><br />I think that's a bit of a stretch. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> I think 2D graphics became &quot;beautiful&quot; around the 16-bit consoles, (PCE might as well be.) but everyone's got their own opinion. Out of the three, I personally think the Genesis looks the ugliest out of the three because it kind of got a double whammy when it comes to colors. The PCE has a lot of colors onscreen, the SNES has a lot of colors total, and the Genesis has neither. (And has even less colors onscreen than the SNES.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tomaitheous wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Sure, that's subjective, but that's usually what it comes down to anyway.

About Majora's Mask, I never really liked it either. Some people act like it's the holy grail or something, but I like Ocarina of Time better but I definitely wouldn't call it &quot;the best game ever&quot;. I like a Link to the Past better.<br /><br />To sum it up, this is how I see both consoles: The PlayStation is more well rounded and just designed better overall, and even though the N64 was more powerful, it was a bit more poorly designed than the PlayStation. Basically, even though the N64 was quite a bit more powerful, the PlayStation didn't look much worse and was still a good competitor. It kind of reminds me of the GameCube vs. the original Xbox (The fact that I have to say original is just ridiculous.) with the GameCube being the PlayStation and the Xbox being the N64. For the longest time, I actually thought the GameCube was more powerful.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6683">Espozo</a> — Mon Feb 23, 2015 1:38 pm</p><hr />

Which is why games were designed with simplistic and small textures (and IIRC, overlaying them) to keep the texture access in cache as much as possible. Maybe the n64 had a higher poly count, but didn't look like it back then nor does it now.

The &quot;Vaseline&quot; effect you're seeing comes from two . One is the N64's 4K texture limit. The other is  the N64 RDP's use of bilinear texture filtering instead of nearest-neighbor resampling. In similar situations, the PS1 would have gone all blocky. I wonder whether preferring the aliased look of PS1 textures is related to preferring the aliased look of bilevel rendering of TrueType fonts or preferring the aliased audio resampling in GBA games over the Gaussian filtering in Super NES games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Feb 22, 2015 9:40 am</p><hr />

I remember playing the N64 for the first time and thinking how wonderful it looked (I had a PS1). I had borrowed it from my brother, along with Zelda and Mario 64. It didn't take long to realized that games really lacked in textures, while PS1 games consistently made advancements in textures for games. Going back to a N64 after a while, and the difference was jarring. It was like someone smeared vaseline over the TV screen (composite). It was weird to see Nintendo, once this incredible juggernaut, get demoted to one of those loyalist-by-name only systems. I mean, the game library was pathetic in comparison to the PS1. I was an adult by then, but I only knew of one friend who actually owned the thing. He would consistently try to convince all how superior it was hardware wise; as if that made the difference. We got to play all these wonderful PS1 games, and he got to play... well, N64 games. And being an adult, a lot of us had PC gaming rigs as well (LAN parties were awesome). I kinda felt bad for big N, in a way, and was excited about the Gamecube. At least it was a much better run of games than the N64, and the vaseline effect was gone.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3645">tomaitheous</a> — Sun Feb 22, 2015 9:09 am</p><hr />

I remember getting very far in Banjo-Kazooie. I believe I was at the first witch battle basically at the end, but haven't won that battle yet. So one day I turned on my N-64 and for some reason didn't turn on my tv. I thought &quot;im so good at this game and know it so well that I could probably navigate my way all the way to the witch battle without even seeing any video and basically doing it blindly. <br /><br />So I imagined walking through the castle and the rooms and doors and such and when I felt that I had finally gotten to my destination I turned on the tv to see how close I was. <br /><br />When I finally turned on the tv I was shocked. I never even made it past the select screen and your not going to believe this, but I had actually DELETED my save file while I thought I was playing the game!!!<br /><br />I couldn't believe it when it happened. All my work and progress... all gone.

I know I'm a bit bias, but I mean, come one. I've seen people who say that the PS1's blocky textures look better than the N64's smooth, but blurry, textures. It's been said that the N64 has some sort of &quot;microcode&quot; or something that kind of controls how the system functions and apparently, the one that Nintendo supplied was terrible. Eventually, companies started making their own and that's how you have games like Conker's Bad Fur Day, which in my opinion, looks better than anything the PlayStation ever outputted, including the Crash Bandicoot games. Another great looking game that comes to mind is the Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine. Rare and Factor 5 were really good at making good looking N64 games. Oh, and another good looking N64 game is Hydro Thunder. The models for the boats look amazing for an N64 game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6683">Espozo</a> — Mon Feb 16, 2015 6:10 am</p><hr />

I remember back in 5th grade when I proudly supported the N64 as one of the best consoles ever when I got into a small argument with and I still know his name today, Dennis. <br /><br />Dennis said that the graphics on the N-64 made everything look like a polygon and that the PlayStation had way better graphics. Its true that some PlayStation games had CGI cut scenes which looked fantastic, but usually those weren't part of the actual gameplay. And since both PS1 and N64 both used polygons to render characters and such I never saw the whole point of his argument. <br /><br />I distinctively remember this because I was in shock that someone actually had the guts to say that PS1 was better than N64 in terms of graphics because at the time I certainly believed that the N64 was far superior than the PS1. <br /><br /><br />I also remember when I first saw the PlayStation 1 in a Toys R Us store and saw the fighting game Tekken for the first time. I was totally blown away by the CGI movie scenes, but for some reason never felt compelled to actually want one as a kid. <br /><br />I guess my thinking at the time was... I'm a kid so I don't have a lot of money and I already have an SNES and since there wasn't any particular game that I was interested in playing I just never got a PS1 until many years later. <br /><br />What's really funny is when I told my friend about the PlayStation 1 that I saw at the store. I told him that I saw a very cool new video game system and that it was called the PlayStation. His reaction to the name of the console is mind blowing when I think of it as of today. My friend literally said &quot;PlayStation? That sounds like a little kids toy hahaha&quot;.<br /><br />So yeah, there you have it, my friend and I were in the 3rd or 4th grade and he seriously made fun of the PlayStation name and thought that the name of it sounded like a babies toy. Looking at this in retrospective is just hilarious! <br /><br />Who would have known that PlayStation would have been such a HUGE thing that is one of the big players in the console market today? We were just in 4th grade and it was just brand new, we didn't know how big it was going to be. <br /><br />But just the thought of a little kid actually making fun of the name PlayStation is ironic, because at face value without ever seeing the console or anything it might as well be some little kids toy, but almost nobody regards it as a little kids toy today. <br /><br />I'm guessing my friend thought PlayStation meant something like this:<br /><br /><img src="http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f246/finaltheorygames/Educational-Toys-Super-Maze_zps5m3g7ozf.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Does anyone actually remember what these were called? The balls on the wire rigs? I swear that the big ones which were more like a table were called Playstations. Because it was like a station where you played at, like at a doctors office.<br /><br /><br />For me the only thing that mattered was Super Mario 64. Even though PlayStation looked cool I was just blown away by the N64. I used to get my mom to drop me off at my local blockbuster for hours just to I would play the N64 on display. I remember that every second that I held that controller in my hand and zoomed around the camera and jumped and controlled Mario was just the coolest thing I had ever experienced in my life. <br /><br />I actually remember renting an N64 before I got one, yes renting, remember when Blockbuster used to rent consoles? LOL. And on Christmas day that year I finally got one and it was the GREATEST thing ever in my life! EVER!!!<br /><br />Ironically when the GameCube came out I played Super Mario Sunshine, but just didn't have that same experience that I once had with Super Mario 64 when it was brand new. So because I wasn't blow away with the Gamecube I never got one. <br /><br />I honestly still don't know exactly why I felt the way I did when I played the Gamecube. Was I not as interested because I was getting a little older and &quot;grew&quot; out of video games? Was it because the leap from the SNES to N64 was so dramatic where as the leap from the N64 to the Gamecube wasn't so much? I still don't know and I still don't own a Gamecube to this day either.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6785">Erockbrox</a> — Sun Feb 15, 2015 11:07 pm</p><hr />

I have tons of stories so let me see if I can't think of any off the top of my head. <br /><br />I remember when I was in 3rd and 4th grade going to school in the early to mid 90's. I had my own room with a color tv and an SNES with a library of around 15 games. My friends Nate and Chris also lived very close to me on my street. Chris also had an SNES and Nate had a Sega Genesis. <br /><br />We would all hang out and do stuff together like roller blade, play basket ball and of course play video games. I remember seeing Zelda a link to the past for the very first time at Chris's house. It wasn't his game, but actually his uncles game. I remember just watching some of the game play and apparently his uncle had already beaten the game as he was at the pyramid where you fight Gannon. I also remember seeing all of those items on the menu when you press start, it was mesmerizing! The first thoughts that came to my mine about Zelda 3 for the SNES were &quot;this must be a big boys game&quot; as if it were for older players since his uncle was playing it. I soon told my parents about Zelda and I eventually got a copy and its still one of my favorite games of all time. <br /><br />I guess now is a good time to plug something. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />So many years later I came across Zelda Parallel Worlds and was very inspired to create my own Zelda hack. Parallel Worlds actually introduced me to romhacking. This led me to contact Gamemakr24 who has been working on his own Zelda 3 hack for years. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.questforcalatia.net/Zelda3C/diary.html">http://www.questforcalatia.net/Zelda3C/diary.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />And just to let you guys know, I've been designing and making things for this Zelda 3 hack Quest for Calatia for around 6 years. But progress on Gamemakers side is slow due to his real life.<br /><br />Now back to the story <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />When I was young it just seemed as if everything in the world were different. I remember when Nate and his sister would come over to my house to play some SNES games. We would play Mario Paint a lot and we would make sex jokes with the sounds in the music composer editor were if you pick the sun face thing and put it down as a low note you hear &quot;uhh hun&quot; like as if people were having sex! lol<br /><br />Nate and his sister would always have to be home by a certain time and I remember telling them that my clock was fast just so we could have extra time together playing games even though my clock wasn't fast at all. lol<br /><br />Since Nate and I together had the Sega Genesis and SNES we seriously had the best of both worlds. In fact there times when I would even go over to his house when he was gone when my family would go out for the night and I would rent a Genesis game and have the whole system to myself. <br /><br />Some of the greatest moments in my life were seriously sitting on a wooden bench next to my friend Nate playing Sonic 2 on his Genesis in his garage room. I would always be Tails and he would be Sonic and I would get killed and lost and left behind, but the experience was so cool that I didn't even care that I was Tails. <br /><br />Nate's parents were strict Christians and wouldn't let him do things that other regular parents would. Like he couldn't even say the word &quot;hell&quot;. Nate couldn't listen to music that was curse words in them and so he always had a bunch of Christian rock music around. I don't know why, but one day I actually brought a VHS tape with Beavis and Butthead recorded on it we played it in the living room and his parents HATED it, but Nate loved it!<br /><br />We would then secretly rent the Beavis and Butthead games and play them. There was this one day when I brought over the Genesis version on Beavis and Butthead which I had rented and we were trying to find a way to play it without his parents knowing. So we first tried to play it with the volume really low, but it wasn't any fun, but then we remembered...... the Sega Genesis headphone jack!!!<br /><br />So we played Beavis and Butthead at his house even when his parents were right in the next room over and it was a thrilling experience because we played in at the edge of our toes because we always had to be on guard to quickly turn off the game if either one of his parents should come into the room.  <br /><br />When I think of more stories I will post them. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6785">Erockbrox</a> — Sat Feb 07, 2015 11:56 am</p><hr />

I recall when my brother and me asked &quot;Santa&quot; for &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; (NES) for christmas and we were so excited about it. We knew where our parents hid the presents for christmas and we were thinking about how we could figure out if Zelda was in one of the packages (they were all wrapped). And I got this idea, the Zelda-box had a hole in it! And of course, I secretly searched through the presents for a suitable wrapped gift and see if I could locate the hole with my fingers.<br />And yes, finally I located the Zelda-present. <br />Our parents never caught us. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Another story, we got &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; for christmas (still my favourite game), it must have been 1987/88 or so. I remember me and my brother played it alot. The highest level we got to was 68. It's insane how I remember that. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Anyway, a few months back I brought my NES + Mario Bros to my parents house, I expected my brother to be there aswell, he didn't knew I brought this stuff. So I finally got there and showed it to him and of course we played it once again together (it was probably 30 years ago since we played it together the last time)! We never made it to level 68. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />Two weeks later, he purchased himself a NES once again. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Here are two photos from the 80's:<br />Some of the games we got.<br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2590713/NES/boxes.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Me in the late 80's with some games. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2590713/NES/boxes2.jpg" alt="Image" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=353">oRBIT2002</a> — Wed Feb 04, 2015 5:19 am</p><hr />
