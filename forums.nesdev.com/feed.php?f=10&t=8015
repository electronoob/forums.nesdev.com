I was wondering if there is a better method than this.</div><br /><br />This is actually a pretty standard method, but you may end up writing more code to work with this system than you would to just work with separate handlers for each purpose. I'm assuming though when you say there's the high byte, low byte, then tile data, you're talking about drawing a horizontal row of tile data, correct?<br /><br />If this is the case, you'll end up using a lot of buffers to draw an image with more than one row. Depending on the size of images, what may help is to have a system where you have the PPU low, high, width, and height of the image, and THEN the tile data. If coded efficiently, it could save time and space while still being general purpose.<br /><br />But honestly, I would recommend just coding separate handlers. For scrolling, have one that updates single rows/columns of tiles (this way you won't need bytes saying how long the row is because you would probably be updating all 32 or 30 tiles that come on screen as a new row or column is revealed). If you need to update a few miscellaneous tiles, just have another handler that does those.<br /><br />Going a little off topic, if you find yourself trying to do a lot of BG updates for things like moving trees, stars that flicker, moving water, etc., you may want to consider using CHR-RAM instead of CHR-ROM to update the tile images themselves rather than the entire background with new pre-defined tiles.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Wed Aug 03, 2011 7:44 pm</p><hr />

I often have a bunch of custom code for this, because I'm a little more ambitious with the amount of bytes I transfer to VRAM than most people, so I really need a few unrolled loops.<br /><br />One advice I have though is that you allow the program to pick different VBlank handlers. In my game, the main gameplay needs the specialized code I mentioned earlier, but the rest of the program can do with a standard handler, so I just switch as needed.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Jul 31, 2011 6:10 pm</p><hr />

If you use this for nametables also, you will want to have the 'VRAM address inc-by-32' feature available for drawing columns.  There's a lot of ways to optimize the buffer-unloading code, but it probably only matters if you're wanting to rewrite tiles during vblank (16 bytes per tile adds up fast).<br /><br />In my NMI routine, I normally rewrite the palette every vblank, copying from RAM.

You just have to do whatever you need to make your game world move one step/frame forward. During this process you'll also have to buffer video information (such as sprite data and background data) that will be written to VRAM during the next vertical blank.<br /><br />Common tasks such as reading the controllers, clearing sprites, etc. can be put into subroutines, so that they are easily accessible from any part of your game.<br /><br />The last part (audio and video updates) can be shared among all the game sections if you want to. If you consistently use a standardized buffer system that satisfies all parts of the game you can utilize it for the whole program.<br /><br />To move from one game section to another, just jump between them. You can JSR to a new section (which will actually be a sub-section) if you plan to return later (something you would do with an in-game menu, for example) or just JMP to it (like when you die and go back to the title screen).

There are many ways to do it, but here's a quick breakdown of how I structure my code (this is from a LoZ type game I'm working on):<br /><br />I tend to keep my main states (states that are not really related to each other) separate and use absolute JMP/JSR to get there. "RESET" actually falls into "Sub_TitleScreen" and then into "Sub_MainMenu," but they could be jumped to from anywhere in the code. The name entry screen is contained within "Sub_NewGame."<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">RESET:<br />   ; init hardware, variables<br /><br />Sub_TitleScreen:<br /><br />   ; reset variables<br />   ; do title screen stuff<br />   ; loop until player presses start<br /><br />Sub_MainMenu:<br /><br />   ; do menu stuff<br />   ; loop untill player makes a choice<br />   if &#40; choice == 0 &#41;<br />      jsr Sub_NewGame<br />   else<br />      jsr Sub_LoadGame<br />   jsr Sub_GameplayMain<br />   jmp Sub_TitleScreen<br /></div><br /><br /><br />This is my main(), and also where I start breaking things down into gamestates and use <strong>jmp ($n)</strong>.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Sub_GameplayMain:<br /><br />   ; init gamestate<br /><br />_loop_gameplayMain:<br />   ; check player-&gt;actor collsion<br />   ; run actor ai<br />   ; scroll camera if needed<br />   ; check area transition<br />   ; run map script<br />   ; fill oam<br /><br />   lda #TRUE<br />   sta frameFinished<br />_loop_wait:<br />   lda frameFinished<br />   bne _loop_wait<br />   jmp _loop_gameplayMain<br />   <br />_loop_exit:<br />   ; death scene or game ending<br />   rts<br /></div><br /><br />frameFinished is cleared in the NMI handler after the vram buffer has been written and sprite dma is finished.<br /><br /><br />Moving actors (players, enemies, etc) is done in "run actor ai." Text boxes are a substate of the player. The reason for choosing to structure it that way was because the player should not be able to do anything but acknowledge the text box when it's on screen. This may not work for your design, I know there are some RPGs that let you walk around while being talked to. This is how I handle the state of actors:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">   ldy Object_Type, X       ;<br />   lda objAI_ptrlo, Y       ;   get pointer to object<br />   sta t0                   ;   state table<br />   lda objAI_ptrhi, Y       ;<br />   sta t0 + 1               ;<br />   lda Object_State, X      ;   get object state pointer<br />   asl                      ;<br />   tay                      ;<br />   lda &#40;t0&#41;, Y              ;<br />   sta IndJump              ;<br />   iny                      ;<br />   lda &#40;t0&#41;, Y              ;<br />   sta IndJump + 1          ;<br />   jsr Func_IndirectJump      ;   goto ai handler<br /></div><br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Func_IndirectJump:   jmp &#40;IndJump&#41;<br /></div><br /><br />Scripting of any kind is handled in "run map script." A pointer is set when an area is loaded and is jumped to every frame.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=187">never-obsolete</a> — Sun Jul 31, 2011 1:51 pm</p><hr />

Thanks. I've actually got the RTS/Jump trick implemented in that ROM.<br /><br />I suppose the way to do it is to have multiple gameloops and then have a pointer to each one. Then, at the end have a <div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">jmp &#40;gameloopPointer&#41;</div> and just switch the pointer between modes. Am I on the right track?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4959">booker</a> — Sun Jul 31, 2011 1:01 pm</p><hr />
