		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That is kind of a valid point. I presume there are two kinds of mishaps that may happen to the perfectly good square wave signal:<ul><li>Emphasis of spikes at edges</li><li>Trailing bias towards average (appears as smoothing and slanted lines)</li></ul>Possibly a mixture of both. An of course, addition of a DC offset.
<br />Aside from the DC offset, I am not sure how to precisely model these mishaps. I.e. how do I write a capacitor in code. Sure I have done all the R-C-τ calculations when I was in engineering school, but it has been years. I still remember R = 1÷√(2πFC)… But not what it was used for.
<br />Perhaps someone could contribute a good square wave function that models these effects with parameters, like:<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">float GetSquareWaveSample&#40;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; float wavelength /* the signal repeats at these intervals*/,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; float offset /* offset into the signal; if wavelength=2, then offset 0..2 represents a single and complete wave with the top and the bottom, and 2..4 repeats it */,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; float spike_emphasis /*Some measure how much the transitions are over-emphasized. */,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; float smoothness /* A value of 0 produces a perfect squarewave &#40;assuming no spikes&#41;, a large value produces a signal that slowly approaches the desired signal level, with the edges starting a bit closer to the middle-level than they should */<br />&#41;;</div>
<br />
<br />In hardwareguy's oscilloscope dump, it appears that there is no spike overshooting effect, but the signal level settles to the desired level in a perfect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_circuit#Time-domain_considerations" class="postlink">RC curve</a>, as in every 10th of the wavelength it changes by 70% of the difference of the current and intended signal level or something like that (rather than the 100% currently simulated by my algorithm).
<br />Now, the question is, at which step(s) does the degradation happen? This is particularly important with the de-emphasis bits: If the signal controlling the effect of the de-emphasis bits is analog rather than digital, the problem of how to decide the de-emphasis attenuation level is back and stronger than ever.
<br />
<br />The current model does reflect accurately the color signal as it is in <em>some</em> stage internal to the NES PPU. I am not sure whether the goal of accurate emulation should be to emulate the purest source signal as it is generated or all the myriad of possibilities it can get damaged on various hardware. I tend to lean on the side of the former, but that may be just laziness.

<br />
<br />And why I don't like that approach. I did it mostly for fun and to get palettes that matched my tv's output. I would prefer a really good palette generator instead, but it seems that they also have problems if there isn't any standard ("correct") way to decode colors. And probably no way(?) to get them to generate palettes that match my captured palettes without knowing how my video card/tv decodes colors.
<br />

<br />
<br />EDIT: And oh, there is then another, far more serious problem if you seek accuracy: RGB without color management is &lt;insert negative attributes here&gt;. To quote Wikipedia: <em>RGB is a device-dependent color model: different devices detect or reproduce a given RGB value differently, since the color elements (such as phosphors or dyes) and their response to the individual R, G, and B levels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, or even in the same device over time. Thus an RGB value does not define the same color across devices without some kind of color management.</em>

<br />You will be surprised: inside PPU. This shots are taken direct from 21 pin of PPU. Closer:
<br /><a href="http://savepic.su/433471.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://savepic.su/433471m.png" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />And even more closer:
<br /><a href="http://savepic.su/421183.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://savepic.su/421183m.png" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />So, some integrating circuit are present in it. I think, they are made on purpose to reduce spectrum of color subcarrier, and do not allow our decoder go mad (many, many color spikes in B-Y channel will be present, believe me, I had experience to build digital PAL coder. :3).
<br />So, where is your God?

<br />
<br />The DAC in the PPU is one big resistor with a number of taps. Modellable as a shoddy R2R network probably, but the deemph attenuation is controlled digitally -- it's just another tap on the thing.
<br />
<br />There's going to be two main sources of distortion in the output. Internal to the PPU, there's probably some slew rate limits on the output, probably combined with RC effects. External to the PPU, there's the video filter circuit, which probably smooths things out even more.
<br />
<br />I would suggest that the canonical emulation would be for the post-filtered AV-out video, since that is what 99.99999999999999% of the audience would be comparing to.
<br />
<br />
<br />@HardWareMan
<br />
<br />The 12 phases should be evenly spaced, since the 21 MHz clock is nominally 50/50. The filter should be phase-agnostic as far as output, since they're all at the same frequency.

<br />In theory - yes. In practice - it depends on the implementation of the divider. Here are 12 phases (6 lines and 6 inverse):
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">21M _-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-<br />PH0 ______------______------<br />PH1 -______------______-----<br />PH2 --______------______----<br />PH3 ---______------______---<br />PH4 ----______------______--<br />PH5 -----______------______-<br />PH6 ------______------______<br />PH7 _------______------_____<br />PH8 __------______------____<br />PH9 ___------______------___<br />PHA ____------______------__<br />PHB _____------______------_<br /></div>
<br />We see that the need to build the first 6 phases, 6 secondly - it is the inversion of the first. 3 phases is generated at the rise of masterclock and 3 at descent. Depending on the implementation possible additional phase shift between them if masterclock are not 50% duty cycle (wich hard to get in simple generator, wich used in NES). Furthermore, if the inverted phase signal a formed by simple inverter, they will be delayed for a delay time of inverter. It's obvious. The only true way to learn how to form the 12 phases of the color subcarrier and calculate their delay with respect to each other is decapsulation and research of the PPU's crystal.

<br />Yes, but an RGB palette in an emulator (whether constants or generated) is just RGB values without any information about how they are to be interpreted. Information that would allow displaying them on different monitors / other devices in the same way.

<br />Both major PC operating systems tend to assume that RGB unadorned with color management information should be interpreted as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB" class="postlink">sRGB</a>. So the final step of a palette generator would involve translating from whatever color space to sRGB.
