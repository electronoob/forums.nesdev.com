<br />There is currently no backup system, copier, or dev kit for the NES.  However, there are 4 projects in the works, one of them is already finished actually, but it is only for music and sound effects development.  Your best bet for the near future is the Squeedo flash cart.  The main limitation of making a copier for the NES is the fact that there are 100s of different circuit boards for different games.  Hence there is less of a distinction between software and hardware than we are used to these days.  So in order to recreate a game, you need more than a NES and the game ROM(s), you also need the cart's circuitry.  One project listed below is doing just that for every circuit!
<br />
<br />1.  Squeedo: A NES flash cart made by the admin (Memblers) of the NESDev site and these forums.  It should be available for sale later this year.  It will support a few of the official Nintendo mappers such as UNROM and CNROM.  The Squeedo also has a very powerful co-processor that can be used alongside the NES's CPU for whatever you can imagine.  <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=15" class="postlink">More info here.</a>
<br />
<br />2.  MIDINES: A NES cart for audio developers.  It lets you use your NES as a musical insturament via the standard MIDI cable.  Probably not what you are looking for, unless you are really into NES music and sound effects.  <a href="http://www.wayfar.net/" class="postlink">More info here.</a>  You can sometimes find them on Ebay too.
<br />
<br />3.  NES Maxicart:  Not anywhere near being completed, AFAIK.  I am not sure how many official mappers it will support, but I think it will support more mappers than the Squeedo cart.  <a href="http://www.vgwiz.com/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=6&amp;sid=c6258ff1194b1ad631f8d79be3d6b6d4" class="postlink">More info and even some pictures of the cart</a> are in this forum.
<br />
<br />4.  Kevtendo:  This is probably the coolest of the bunch.  It is a pixel-perfect cycle accurate clone of the NES and all of its hundreds of mappers.  The project started out as a universal flash cart for the NES and morphed into a complete clone of the NES system.  It will be able to use official NES peripherials such as lightguns, controllers, R.O.B., Power Glove (so cool), etc... and it plays games off of small standard SD flash cards.  <a href="http://forums.cherryroms.com/viewtopic.php?t=3618" class="postlink">More info here</a>.

<br />As you can see, if you can mimic MMC1, MMC3, UNROM, NROM, and CNROM, you can play the majority of NES games. Of course there are games that use specific mappers that I need to play. (Punch-Out, Akumajo Densetsu, and all the FDS games).

<br />Camerica can probably piggyback as a variant of UNROM, and NROM is the special case of CNROM with the upper CHR address lines not connected to anything.

<br />
<br />Note that for Squeedo, it's normal way of operating would be similar enough in some cases, but not all them.  It's the other way around unfortunately, the game would have to be compatible with Squeedo, heh (4-screen mode).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />thanks tepples, that's about as good as it comes.  Converting that info into a schematic is pretty easy, just need a good way to verify the design.  I think I can probably test the mappers independently of everything else, which will help give me confidence it will work when I put it all together.  I'll just remove the MMC chip from some cart, wire in my test implementation from the FPGA and plug it into the NES.  I just have to pick a game that uses most of the functionality of the MMC, because I don't want to have to do that too many times!

<br />
<br />Any CPU would be too slow.  Mappers don't have much time to work with (think 10's of nanoseconds).  So everything has to be done in parallel.

<br />
<br />No, there doesn't seem to be such an animal.  Most FPGA's I looked at claimed to be "5V compliant", which is a bit of a disappointment.  You need to be above 2.7V for a 5V TTL signal to be considered "high".  This means using a 3.0V output pin from the FPGA you can drive a 5V TTL input on your old hardware.  However, this doesn't work the other way.  Driving 5V into a 3.0V input is a fantastic way to make your apartment smell like burnt plastic.  So I'm using some bus level shifters to do it all, about 80 channels worth of it.
