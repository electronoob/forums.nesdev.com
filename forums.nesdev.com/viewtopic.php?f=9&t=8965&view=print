		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, I pretty much understand how to do this after researching, but I'd just like to confirm this information with the veterans here.
<br />
<br />I understand that Mother can be reproduced using TK-Rom boards, but I'm just plain unwilling to give up my copy of Deja Vu.
<br />As I understand it, a TN-ROM is suitable except for the lack of a battery to power the WRAM when the system is off.
<br />
<br />What I have is a copy of Tetris 2 I'm willing to offer up as a sacrifice, and a ready supply of diodes, capacitors, resistors, and batteries.
<br />
<br />After doing some research and tracing the paths from my copy of Deja Vu, here's what I've come up with:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Adding Battery backup to TN-ROM boards:<br /><br />Supplies Needed:<br />2 Diodes &#40;lowest forward voltage&#41;<br />1 1kiloohm resistor<br />1 2.2uf 5volt electrolytic capacitor<br /><br />1&#41; Clip pin 28 on WRAM, solder 2 separate wires to hole 28 and pin 28.<br />2&#41; BATTERY POSITIVE - solder to DIODE &#40;clear end&#41;, &#40;DIODE banded end&#41; to RESISTOR; RESISTOR to CAPACITOR POSITIVE --AND-- to WRAM Pin 28 -END-<br />3&#41; 5V &#40;hole 28's wire&#41; to DIODE &#40;clear end&#41;, DIODE &#40;banded end&#41; to WRAM Pin 28' wire<br />4&#41; Solder BATTERY NEGATIVE to CAPACITOR NEGATIVE</div>
<br />
<br />Is this how it is supposed to work?
<br />I understand the concept and what each part does (diodes block system 5v from exploding the battery, or making the battery power the cart, capacitor smooths the transition between system power and battery, and resistors act as voltage magnets).
<br />
<br />from what I can see on my copy of Tetris 2, Wram pin 1 has no connection (maybe I can have battery in on pin 1 and leave system voltage on 28 without clipping pins?), and there is already a 2.2uf capacitor on board to the left of the MMC3C (negative connects to ground, positive to 5v).
<br />
<br />Can I simplify this by using parts already on the board?

<br />
<br />If I wanted to make money, I'd be using donor boards that didn't require $5 in parts.
<br />
<br />This is just for me, I have no intent of selling it.
<br />
<br />You don't seem to have any problem with other reproductions on this board.
<br />I can see at least 5 threads on page 1.

<br />
<br />Your basically asking someone to explain the entire process for you.  I don't know how to answer your question other than do all the reasearch myself on the differences between the two boards and create a schematic for you and then tell you how to assemble everything.  I nor anyone else is likely to get any enjoyment out of doing all that leg work for you.
<br />
<br />My suggestion: Research.  Draw a schematic.  Assemble it.  Troubleshoot.  Play.

<br />I already have my plan posted above, I already explained that I know HOW it works and WHY it works.
<br />
<br />I just want a simple "yes" or "no" from someone who has already done this, and if I can use the capacitor already on the board.
<br />
<br />did I get it right? if so, cool.
<br />if not, I'll go back to doing my own research like I did in the first place.
<br />
<br />I know it will save data and keep the WRAM safe, but will it last as long as a normal cart, or did I screw up the wiring and cause the battery to drain too fast? I can't test that any way besides running the console for hours.
<br />
<br />Here's the damned schematic.

<br />Exactly. If you don't pullup these signals to backup power, your data can be corrupted. To be honest, you must build this schematic:
<br /><img src="http://savepic.net/2916787.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />Or use some specific IC, for example BA6162:
<br /><img src="http://savepic.net/2908595.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />And your data will be saved for years. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> I have Light Crusider cartrige for Megadrive and save files are works after 5 years from last use.

<br />
<br />While that circuit is probably drastically better than the original circuit most people don't have issues with the original one provided you do put the pull ups/downs on /CE(CE) respectively like you pointed out.
<br />
<br />One thing is your circuit doesn't affect the lifetime of save data in regards to years.  It protects it when inserting/removing and power on/off the cartridge which is where most problems arise.  But the lifetime (years) a that the data will be maintained mostly depends on the static power consumption of whichever SRAM you choose, and the shelf life and quality of the battery.
<br />
<br />I've had data maintained with Nintendo's standard battery backing last from when I played as a kid nearly 20 years ago.

<br />Exactly. But we assume that SRAM is a low power one and battery is good one, isn't it?
