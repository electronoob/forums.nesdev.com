Having an emu on this thing could present a decent opportunity to release homebrew NES games without (or in addition to) the hassles of cartridge release.  Or even a full out console game for those interested in more hardware than the NES has to offer.  Pretty cool to see this thing being supported so well.

That will help in building a large user base of both developers and gamers. A console with specific hardware and controllers that is easy to pick up and plug in and play, and easy to develop for. I think it's a great idea. Of course there are other android based devices, and noone is stopping anyone from developing more.

The average, non-technical home user doesn't mind the lockdown; otherwise, there wouldn't have been a console market for the past quarter century. There has to be some lockdown in order to reassure professional developers that they'll be able to sell more than one copy of their works, as opposed to selling one copy to a member of the warez scene and having everybody else download infringing copies from a warez site.

That just means the platform holder wants to make money out of every piece of software that gets released.

It may allow sideloading without rooting, after all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">There has to be some lockdown in order to reassure professional developers that they'll be able to sell more than one copy of their works, as opposed to selling one copy to a member of the warez scene and having everybody else download infringing copies from a warez site.</div><br />If this was the case computers would have been killed for gaming soon after they started being used for that purpose. How many decades ago was that?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Same-screen multiplayer is the big hole in the PC's game lineup. If people were more willing to connect a device that ran PC games (even if not a &quot;PC&quot;) to a TV, there'd be a market for indie games that support same-screen multiplayer. But right now, same-screen multiplayer is stuck on consoles and indie gamers who aren't alumni of a mainstream studio are stuck on PCs, which means indie developers are locked out of entire genres. This frustration is why Ouya exists.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was talking about locking down devices, though. You were talking like if the device isn't a walled garden then it's doomed to failure because developers aren't guaranteed games won't get copied (even though that happens on pretty much every platform, even iOS). Computers are pretty much the prime example of why that is wrong.<br /><br />And same-screen multiplayer on PCs was killed since pretty much the beginning due to lack of suitable input devices, not due to not being able to use a TV, by the way. Getting two players on the same keyboard gets tedious and key ghosting completely ruins it. Joysticks would have fixed this, but unlike with other home computers they weren't considered the standard device for gaming and most people never had one (that's more of a recent thing and even then it's usually just one).<br /><br />And Ouya seems to be trying to go for console gamers anyway, not PC gamers - and honestly, even big developers are trying to squish same-screen multiplayer away from consoles (so every player is required to buy a copy of the game along with whatever DLC is required).
