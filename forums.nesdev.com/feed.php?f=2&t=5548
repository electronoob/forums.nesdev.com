The exact solution I found can't be seen in any existing games or tutorial on the internet.<br /><br />For the objects however, I couldn't think of anything better/faster than what I presented here.

I move my rays across the grid a step at a time, and it's working pretty well. I have a resolution of 28 columns (much less than 320!), meaning that I have only 14 relative angles for which the "cosine correction" is necessary (the right side is a mirror of the left side), So I actually pre-corrected all the distances in my distance table for the 14 possible angles, so I don't need to do anything to get rid of fish eye distortion either.<br /><br />I'm not really worried about objects/enemies right now, I'm just happy because I got the walls working on the NES and it's not dead slow, it's actually pretty playable. So I'll spend some time polishing that part up before I try to place any objects in. I still welcome suggestions of course, so if anyone has any I'd be glad to hear about them.<br /><br />PS: I'll soon make a thread to display my achievements with this, and I'll let everyone play the demo by themselves once it's a bit less messy.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Oct 01, 2009 6:11 pm</p><hr />

The classic raycaster design sends out 320 rays, one for each column of a PC monitor in 320x200px display modes. The length of the ray determines how big the column is drawn. But a quicker and more physically correct way to determine distance to a wall is to dot-product the ray from the camera to the wall with the "forward" ray; this method has the "cosine correction" built in as well.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Oct 01, 2009 5:01 pm</p><hr />

Also, ask yourself if you really need to calculate the distance.  If you are just using this to determine if something is within a certain distance, you can avoid that by comparing the distance squares instead.  instead of 2 multiplications, an addition, and a square root, you could just have 3 multiplications, and one addition.<br /><br />If you really need the distance, I can't really see a way around the square root.  As to the angle, what are you using it for?  Sometimes people use angles to determine what side something is compared to another.

Would anyone by any chance have any ideas about how to find angle "a" and side "h" knowing only sides "b" and "c"?<br /><br />The best I got so far is:<br />1. divide "b" by "c" to find the tangent of the angle;<br />2. binary search a table of tangents to find what angle has that tangent;<br />3. divide "b" by the sine of "a" to find "h";<br /><br />The bad thing is that 2 divisions are needed. Pythagoras wouldn't be much better for finding the hypotenuse, as two multiplications and a square root can be quite slow, and there will still be the angle.<br /><br />If I can't find any better way to do this, I might end up doing it like this anyway. It's not like there are as many objects as wall slices in a room, so if the object count is low enough it might not have such a great impact on performance. Also, if the angle indicates that the object isn't visible (it's behind the player), the second division isn't necessary as it won't be displayed.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Sep 02, 2009 1:37 pm</p><hr />

I seem to have calculated correctly the 512-byte table that can be used in a binary search. I have tested all possible values for the variable (which represents the distance to a wall) and the search result always matches the actual division.<br /><br />This method actually has the cool side effect of returning 255 (the largest possible wall height) in case the distance is too small, so I don't even have to specifically check and correct that.<br /><br />If anyone is curious about the table or the search routine, let me know and I can post it here or explain it better.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Sep 01, 2009 11:49 pm</p><hr />

Sometimes you can come up with interesting tricks and approximations, too. Depends on the number.<br /><br />(N / 7) - (N &gt;&gt; 3) ~= N / 56. As for dividing by 7, one could make a lookup table like: 7^1, 7^2, 7^3, etc and loop subtraction.<br /><br />There are also approximation algorithms that have rounding errors of +/- 1, like multiplying and then shifting the result right.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Tue Sep 01, 2009 7:48 pm</p><hr />
