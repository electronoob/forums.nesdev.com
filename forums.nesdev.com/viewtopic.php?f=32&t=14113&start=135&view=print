I'll edit a link to this post into the first post on page 1.<br /><br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>We need to set a date, but 3 months isn't long enough for preparing a quality entry in spare time. A December 31 deadline isn't helpful because holidays are hectic. We're thinking June 1, 2016, through January 31, 2017.</li><li>Anything substantially finished and widely available to the general public before the compo is disqualified. According to NESHomebrew, this rule is &quot;intended to exclude entries that had already been 100% completed, available to the mass public for distribution, or released on cartridge (not including one-off prototypes or small runs for friends etc).&quot; We may still need to fine-tune the wording for this.</li><li>To attract a greater volume of entries, use participation prizes, such as a physically distinctive copy of the resulting multicart or a T-shirt or some (inexpensive) developer hardware. We're still offering cash for entries that win (#1), place (#2), or show (#3), on the order of $250, $150, $80, or $256, $128, $64. If you win a category, you cannot place or show in the same category, and if you place, you cannot show.</li><li>A way to share progress with the public without disqualifying one's entry is desirable. It helps to identify entries that cannot be included for a legal or other serious reason. This could be rewarded with bonus points at judging time or a hardware prize at halfway time.</li><li>A category with a mandatory &quot;theme&quot;, such as a harsh size limit or playing as a bee, would <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=14177" class="postlink">probably not be popular enough</a> to draw entries. Stick with a 64K discrete category (N/CN/UN/AN/BNROM) and anything goes, but possibly add bonus points for meeting an optional theme.</li><li>The 2011 and 2014 compos didn't produce the expected 512K of material for a cart, and carts were delayed until out-of-compo homebrew releases could be found to fill them. We may want to run compos more often to produce one cart from two compos' entries. This may encourage more polished work, as a work can be delayed until a later compo, but may also complicate funding the prizes.</li><li>B00daW wants an original 2A03-only music compo, encouraging engine innovation rather than just exporting NSF from FamiTracker like <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/styles/subsilver2/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" class="postlink">232 out of 275 Famicompo Pico entries did</a>.</li></ol>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the summation Tepples.<br /><br />I think part of the confusion is this is more of a 2016 nesdev compo &quot;survey&quot; or &quot;brainstorming&quot; thread than an announcement thread.  The announcement thread will come soon enough as a conclusion of this thread.  I think my proposal to iron out details and announce official compo rules by the end of this month still is a good goal.  Major decisions are similar enough to past compos that people are welcome to start development now if they don't want to wait until final announcement.

They aren't really meant to be a secret, although many people in the past have preferred it that way.  I think for the first compo we were a little more strict with this. I'm sure having a project posted to the forums for 6+ months will give you a lot of feedback that will improve the quality of the submission.  In the past there had been some frustration from people waiting on the judging process, and just wanted people to see their projects. Making a thread for your game(s) is a way to avoid this frustration.<br /><br />Depending on how we deal with submissions this year, I'd also advise holding off until near the end of the competition to submit your entry. We allow revisions, but in previous years I had some people submit 10+ updated entries fixing bugs etc.  That gets a bit messy on my end, and I have to make sure I have the most recent build.<br /><br />We also haven't decided on the judging criteria yet, so you might want to make some tweaks based on that as well.
