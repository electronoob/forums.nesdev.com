I believe that game engines run based on a more consistent timer and the video system renders as many pictures of the game world per second as necessary for the display.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There is a semi-recent game (circa 2003 to present) that is tied to refresh rate (well not monitor refresh, but a specific redraw interval), where the game mechanics are tied directly to that interval: Final Fantasy XI.  The PC version is capped at 30fps, which is the same cap on the version for the PS2, and that's intentional.  People have found registry hacks to do things like increase texture resolution, draw distance, etc. but nothing for the framerate cap.  Someone supposedly did hack some exe/dll that removed it and their character ran around at 2x the speed, resulting Square/Enix banning said person.  My guess is that this is due to the game being coded questionably for the PS2, then ported to the PC with the same &quot;design requirement&quot; being applied to ensure everything is consistent.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Now that you mentioned it, I do remember reading about other recent (post PS2) games being locked to low framerates. I honestly don't know what the deal is with present-day game development, but you'd imagine that by now they'd be handling gameplay speed and framerates the &quot;correct&quot; way, since the hardware is so powerful.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />By &quot;correct&quot; do you mean no time quantum at all, that time is a floating-point value? If so, that has caused issues where behavior differs from one machine to another. For example, <a href="http://www.funender.com/quake/articles/fps.html" class="postlink">in Quake 3, players could make jumps when the engine was running at a specific frame rate</a> that they couldn't make at other frame rates. (The form on that page requires a genuine Windows operating system because it is written in VBScript; the article below the form is useful elsewhere.) This was caused by the engine approximating the jump trajectory as a polyline with one side per frame, where the number of sides differed from one machine to another, and trapezoidal/Euler integration produces different results with different step sizes. Quantizing game logic time at least assures consistent behavior between machines.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think that so long as the graphics hardware supports reporting Vsync, it's not a bad way to time a simple game, like a 2D platformer or some such. The ease of making a game with no tearing that runs smoothly and allows characters to move at n-pixels/frame is a great advantage.<br /><br />Then again, there are <em>terrible</em> drivers like nouveau that don't properly implement Vsync, and games relying on it will run far too fast and must fall back to timer-based game timing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There's nothing at all questionable about a fixed time step for physics simulation, koitsu. It is a completely valid technique, for modern games or otherwise. There are lots of situations in gameplay design where this becomes a requirement, for various reasons, most of which I think tepples has covered so I won't reiterate.<br /><br />Physics simulation with a variable time step is also quite valid and in common use. It has its own set of advantages and disadvantages.<br /><br />Neither is the default or more correct way to do it; it is a significant choice that affects gameplay, so you need to use the appropriate technique.
