		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In anomie's apudsp.txt it states:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">apudsp.txt wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">0. Voice steps: 0:V5  1:V2<br />     Tick the SPC700 Stage 1 timers, always for T2 and every 4 samples for<br />      T0 and T1.</div><br />I understand the frequencies at which the 3 timers tick and why I'm ticking T2 twice every 32 clock cycles and T0/T1 only once every 4 samples. No problem there.<br /><br />However, one part confuses me.  The doc seems to be stating that <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>immediately out of reset</strong></span> in SMP clock cycle 0 that the stage 1 timers should tick. This seems a bit weird from a hardware design perspective because it seems more likely that the stage 1 timers wouldn't produce their very <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>first</strong></span> tick until either 15.625us have passed (for T2) or 125us have passed (for T0/T1). If it ticks immediately out of reset then it is essentially producing ticks before any time has passed at all.<br /><br />I can implement it either way but I just want to be sure that I'm understanding it right before I go changing my code. Right now I have it where the first ticks don't happen until 15.625us or 125us have passed. In other words, my stage 1 timer is a simple up counter that counts the appropriate number of clock cycles and then &quot;ticks&quot;. So my stage 1 timer would never tick immediately out of reset - instead there would be an appropriate delay before the first tick.  Is that incorrect behavior?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That doc just shows the relative timing of things. So if you tried to implement things without that doc, you'd eventually ask, &quot;When, relative to the DSP sample cycle, do the timers tick? I see 32 possibilities.&quot; and it would answer it. Or at least what the SPC-700 I was testing on did, and what some timing tests I wrote test for.<br /><br />Most/all of the timing in that doc was gleaned by software alone, no hardware tracing. So use it as a guide where there are multiple ways of doing things that software could detect. If it's an issue of how to do it in hardware, where software couldn't see a difference, then the doc has almost nothing useful to say.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, that timing chart shows relative timings, that get repeated every 32 cycles. It doesn't claim to know if /RESET got released on the 1st or 2nd or some other cycle.<br />Although, there <em>should</em> be some (still unknown) relation between /RESET and those 32 cycles (the SMP and DSP chips are both using the same clock source, they should start ticking on reset, and keep running in sync after reset).<br />I have some similar timing chart here, <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/fullsnes.htm#snesapulowleveltimings">http://nocash.emubase.de/fullsnes.htm#s ... veltimings</a><!-- m --> based on Anomie's doc, and some of my own verifications &amp; findings (including attempts to match the memory access timings to the hardware's /OE /WE /CEn signals).<br />Note that I have numbered the cycles differently (my T0..T31 are shifted one step in relation to Anomie's numbering), since they are relative one could number them as pleased. The &quot;T0-point&quot; in doc just looked best to me - and, judging from scope tests, that point should match the rising edge of the hardware's LRCK signal, so it seemed double-reasonable to me to assign it as &quot;T0&quot;.<br />Most of the info in the chart is based on software tests, it should be hopefully correct, but it's hard to test that things. For example, the hardware may do something in cycle, and the CPU may not see it until the next cycle, so it's difficult to assign in which of that two cycles the operation has actually occurred.<br /><br />PS. The time that has ellapsed since /RESET would be unstable / don't care. The main CPU and apu CPU have different clock sources, so there's no chance to upload/start program code on the APU at specific time after reset.

It would be valuable to be able to run code and know what cycle each part of the instruction is running in and when the things actually happen in hardware at each point. With just the software tests one is left wondering which of the many possibilities is the case. When you have lots of software results, you are itching for a unifying model that offers a simple explanation, but there is more than one that fits. Even if you do hardware tests, it might still not be clear how its timing relates to the software.
