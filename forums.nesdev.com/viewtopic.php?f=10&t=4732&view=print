		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello,
<br />
<br />first of all my apologies to everyone for asking the same old question that you probably have heard millions of times. There should be a sticky or something about this. I have used the search function read all the other topics I found about this but I just can't fit it in my head. I don't understand anything about programming. Not even a single bit.
<br />
<br />Now the ultimate newbie question, how on Earth do I <strong>transfer a ROM image from my PC to a NES cartridge?</strong> Could this be explained in <strong>simple English</strong> and in clear steps. I have a ROM image (.nes) on my computer and I want to put it onto a NES cartridge <strong>permanently</strong>, I don't want any flash carts like the PowerPack. <strong>I want the cartridge to have only one game</strong>. I collect games and I want the single cartridges to be in my shelf just like the real deal would be. 
<br />
<br />What do I need to do this and where can I get the stuff (I live in Europe, so the website selling the stuff must deliver worldwide, not just the U.S.)?
<br />
<br />And please, if possible in <strong>simple English</strong>, so even a dummy like I could understand and finally be able to transfer ROMs into cartridges. All I know is that I need to sacrifice one game in order to transform the old game into a new game. But that's it. No idea how this is done.
<br />
<br />Again, sorry to ask this old question.
<br />
<br />
<br /><strong>[Subject Fairy was here --MOD]</strong>

<br />I'm sorry, but I think it doesn't really make sense. If you make a repro, it will just be like a pirated cart (altough it's for personal use). By definition, collectors would typically wants only real carts. If it was a game you really like and hope to play it on the real hardware in your language, it would make much sense.
<br />
<br />Anyway, we can't help you much without you to tell use the title of the game you want to reproduce. It may be very easy or downright impossible depending on the mapper the game uses. If you really don't want to give the title to us for some reson (why would you anyway ?) you must at least copy the iNES header so we know the size and mapper of the ROM.
<br />
<br />To copy permanently, in the best case you need :
<br />- A donor cart
<br />- Some way to crack the cart open without damaging the plastic case
<br />- One or two EPROMs
<br />- A soldering iron, solder, and a disoldering pump
<br />
<br />In the worse scenarios, depending on the mapper you will also need some of these:
<br />- Wires and a cutter to cut traces (very likely).
<br />- A very rare famicom donor cart which is annoying to find and has a ridiculous price thanks to collectors
<br />- Other electronics parts to add to the cricuit
<br />- Modify a Famicom to NES adapter and modify your NES to get extra audio
<br />
<br />Oh, and if you don't understand english well, but understand french better, I can help you, else I can't.

<br />
<br />steps:
<br />Program you program onto rom. This process depends on your burner and software
<br />2.) Match the pinout of the (e)eprom with the mask rom in the cart and see what you'll need to rewire
<br />3.) bend up the pins that you need to rewire and solder in the rom
<br />4.) use wire to rewire the pins that had to be rewired
<br />5.) test it
<br />6.) ???
<br />7.) PROFIT!

<br />but I really wouldn't like to cut the cartridge like that. Is there any way to fit the chips in the cartridge?

<br />How about the EPROM programmer, do I need to have some specific programmer or will any do? And how hard is it to use them and how is this done?

<br />Any will do, and this is usually very easy to use, but expensive. Probably cheaper programmers are harder to use.

All these NROMs, CNROMs, SNROMs, I have no idea what these even are! How do I recognize these? And when it reads somewhere to bend some pins of the chip, does it mean they need to be bended so that they are not touching the circuit board of the cart? 
<br />
<br />Wow, I feel stupid when asking all these questions. But I think I'm starting to understand a little bit. I might sound annoying with all these newbie questions that have been asked forever, but try to bear with me.

<br />
<br />As for rewiring, you need to compare the old pinout (the one that is on the board you use, such as SNROM) and the new pinout (the one of a 27Cxxx EPROM), and change the pins that doesn't match by cutting traces (or bending pins) and add wires. Yes of course they shoud not touch the PCB so that they don't make contact.

<br />
<br />The only reason the chips stick out and require a hole in the cartridge is that the instructions I pointed to are for making a REprogrammable cartridge (which involves soldering a socket onto the board and then simply inserting EPROMs after, to allow for updating the ROM during development; the socket and EPROM together are too large to fit in the unmodified case). Since you are interested in simply programmable cartridges (with permanent EPROM attachment), you can forget about the socket and solder the chip right to the board. The chips without the sockets are low-profile enough to fit into a cartridge without requiring modification. 
<br />
<br />(It may be possible to find low-profile sockets that would allow you to make the reprogrammable setup in an unmodified case, but I think the holes also allow for easier replacement of the EPROMs, again for development. But since you're not interested in reprogrammable carts, this doesn't really matter)
<br />
<br />But again, what is the point of "collecting" a bunch of home-made carts with ROMs ripped from the internet? It seems like a collecter would either be interested only in the game (and in that case emulators or a flash cart would be much easier/cheaper) or the cartridges themselves (and want to find originals of the games). Why do you want a bookshelf full of these home-made carts? Just wondering. Anyway, good luck!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />If you tell us which game it is or if you write it's title in <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/" class="postlink">Bootgod's database</a> chances are that you will be able to get better information.

<br />Although both are good games, I just don't like multicarts even though that one is popular and licensed etc. I have Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt seperately on my shelf and I prefer them so. I do have the multicart, but I don't use it. If I want to play MB or DH I pop in the cart with just one of them, not the multicart. I don't know, it's probably some kind of psychological thing in my brain, who knows. I like single game carts. Some understand, others may not. I have lot of other "weird" habits but let's leave them aside.
<br />
<br />But as for the main subject, I think I got the idea. At least a little. Thank you very much for everyone helping a newbie like me.
