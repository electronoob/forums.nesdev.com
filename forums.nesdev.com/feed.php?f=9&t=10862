I guess in the interest of keeping people informed who have been involved in this thread I decided to update it. <br /><br />I tried using a different computer and it in fact worked differently. I wonder if something happened that caused different results?<br /><br />I managed to erase the chips, although to be honest I did it several times in a row just to ensure I properly erased them. I burned a PRG to the chips and the game still came up garbled. I tried the online software recommended to strip the header out, still got the same results, I tried a different rom, and I got the same results, garbled graphics. <br /><br />Now I will be the first to admit I am completely new to this sort of thing, but I did manage to make a repo that had a .PRG and .CHR file just fine, the first time through, since there is nothing to burn a .CHR file to, assumed that all I did was write the .PRG file and call it good, is there something else you have to do to files that lack both the .PRG and .CHR files? <br /><br />All of my other games work, the 72 pin connector was recently scrubbed clean, bent pins and then boiled, so I doubt it's that and the pins on the PCB are in good shape too. <br /><br />Paul went ahead and e-mailed me asking for close ups of the board, so I sent him some pics after work. I'll keep people updated on what's going on and if it gets resolved.

Let me be perfectly clear, I didn't imply that your text file did not suggest removing the header. I was actually saying a old guide for solder method from another site did not say anything about the header. Sorry for the confusion.<br /><br />As far as doing what you've asked, I'll do it when I get home, as I'm at work right now, but looking at the anago software looks a tad confusing.<br /><br />I'm also thinking about trying on another computer just to see what happens. Computers can be so fickle some times.<br /><br />On a side note, have you considered updating the software for the flash chips to allow for a drag and drop interface, one that'd let you directly see what's on the chips like a more triditional flash drive or something?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6327">Beji</a> — Wed Jan 08, 2014 4:45 pm</p><hr />

Thanks for the response. <br /><br />What you have listed is what I have been literally been trying to do. The entire erasing part goes exactly as you state it should, but as soon as I go to write the PRG file, I always error out. I have tried multiple files, I have tried files with stripped headers, I have tried resetting the programmer, re-installing the drivers, plugging and unplugging the hardware. I cannot get it to write the file.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6327">Beji</a> — Wed Jan 08, 2014 11:52 am</p><hr />

Sorry for the slow response.  <br /><br />Doesn't sound like you're erasing the chip properly.  You're getting indications of failed programming probably because the chip isn't erased.<br /><br />Most people with issues recently have been trying to erase without selecting the header on the pull down.<br /><br />readme cut for your specific needs.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />2) ERASE your chips!!!!   This is currently a very important step...<br />Failing to do this will most likely result in errors when trying to program.<br /><br />a) Select 'header' as file type.<br />b) Click 'load' and navagate to the &quot;ROMS&quot; folder that's in <br />your kazoo folder.<br />c) Select the appropriate ERASE file:<br />-PRG: erases only the PRG-ROM.  Good for development of<br />CPU code, or a board with CHR-RAM like SNROM,TNROM,UNROM.  **AND SGROM! **<br />-PRGCHR: *wrong for SGROM*<br />-CHR: *wrong for SGROM*<br />d) Click 'Write'.<br /><br />***IMPORTANT NOTES***  <br /><br />***Must get the 'Verify OK' message in the text field in the application.  <br />If you don't, reconnect and try again.<br /><br />***Failing to select proper ERASE file will cause issues also.  Selecting<br />ERASE_PRGCHR for a board with CHR-RAM will fail to erase CHR causing errors.<br />select ERASE_PRG in this case.  The software verifies that the flash<br />chip accepts the erase command.<br /><br />***While the chip is erasing, you should see the LED dimly lit.  Once<br />fully erased the light will go out.  This is your signal that it's okay to<br />flash the board.  <br />-NES INL-ROM v2 boards are super fast, you might not even see <br />the light.  Or it may only flicker.  That's okay.<br /><br />***JUST MAKE SURE THE APP SAYS &quot;Verify OK&quot;***  If so then you're ready to flash!<br /></div><br /><br />This is what you should get:<br />Plug in kazzo<br />LED bright RED<br />click test <br />&quot;Tesk OK&quot; reported<br />select header<br />load ERASE_PRG.bin<br />write<br />instantly the LED should turn off<br />&quot;Verify OK&quot; displayed<br />Board is now erased.<br /><br />Program PRG:<br />Select 256KB PRG in pulldown<br />load 256KB .prg/.bin file<br />write<br />watch green bar go across, or 'not responding' message normal.<br />once done &quot;verify OK&quot;<br />LED should NOT come on while programming, although sometimes it may flicker.<br />The light turns on while programming when a byte fails to program.

The 72 pin connector has been recently cleaned and boiled. every single game in my library plays without any hitch and without even pressing down upon.<br /><br />To be honest the first rom I burnt to a PCB, I didn't bother stripping the header and it worked perfectly fine. I didn't even think of it until I read the text file after the second rom I tried to burn didn't work properly. I mean even in the guides for the standard procedure (soldering, donor carts, burning roms) it never mentions anything about stripping the header, just splitting the rom. <br /><br />I mean, you can say it's user error, but I don't know what I am doing wrong. I stick the thingy in the thing, make sure the chips are erased and then try to burn the PRG file, all according to the text read me included with the software. I did it once without any issues so I don't know what I'd be doing wrong this time around.<br /><br />I assumed the upgraded flash chips would allow me to re-flash the board as needed, maybe I am wrong. But I thought even old chips could be re-used several times by using a UV eraser to clear them. <br /><br />It's most likely my fault, but with so little documentation on it, it's hard to even know what's going on. I am gonna wait till Friday and if I don't get a e-mail response through their site, I'll contact them here. The text file has a phone number, but honestly I don't want to call them up.

OK the basics are covered, I know that all the above is covered in the read-me but sometimes restating helps. <br /> To check the size of the flash chip: look for the rectangular chip marked with SST in large print; below that print you should see smaller print that reads 39SF020. this is the flash rom. The '020 is a 256K device; 010 would be a 128K and 040 would be a 512K. <br /> Seeing how you have already flashed a different repo board, the Kazzo hardware should be good, as well as you software install. So this leaves either the flash board or a problem with the ROM file. Have you tested the ROM in a EMU? I assume yes, so you may want to PM INL.<br />Yogi<br />EDIT Just a thought, did you strip the header out of the ROM file, for just a .PRG bin file? Even though it has no CHR file embedded in the NES ROM, the header needs to be removed with Uconn64 or readNES.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6258">yogi</a> — Tue Jan 07, 2014 9:45 am</p><hr />

I'm not an expert, but I have seen the '116' after I do something incorrect <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Try to reboot the Kazzo to reset the firmware. <br />I ran into minor confusion with the wrong 'erase' header ( was the original Anago erase file) or when I had the boot loader switch wrong. <br />Do double check to make sure:<br />1. You have INL's firmware flashed to Kazzo if you'r using the INL GUI<br />2. BL switch to Run<br />3. INL Erase header for installed Flash size, LED will extinguish after erase. EDIT-Rather, PRG erase for a CHR ram board and PRG/CHR erase for a CHR flash board.<br />4. PRG/CHR file size same as Flash chips installed. 128K PRG for 128K Flash chip, or 256K PRG for a 256K Flash.<br />If there is an error at any point, reboot the Kazzo and start over. If I try to continue without, I get error 116. It might help to re-seat the board in the Kazzo connector, a little to the left or right, but with my INL boards they seem snug and don't shift. I have also found that my USB hub slowed things down and/or causes errors, try USB cable direct to PC.<br />I'm sure INL will give more insight, but maybe some of these points might help?<br />Yogi<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6258">yogi</a> — Mon Jan 06, 2014 7:57 pm</p><hr />

Hello there, kind of new to all of this.<br /><br />I wanted to make a couple of repos and found the Kazoo hardware, which simplifies the whole process entirely. I picked up the programmer a month or so ago and managed to make a repo just fine without many issues. <br /><br />I ordered a NES-SGROM board from them and recently got it, with the flash upgrade option; 256 PRG-ROM for CHR-RAM boards option. I got it in the mail today and followed the instructions as followed in the text file included via your site and made sure to erase the chips with the header option before installing anything. Well I burnt the file I needed (I only had the .bin file, no chr file with this one) and it burnt okay, but the cart refuses to boot up, I usually just get a yellow screen and on the off chance it did boot up, the screen was garbled and froze right away. <br /><br />I tried to erase and re-burn the file, but the Kazoo keeps giving me an error-116, no matter what I try. Any ideas? Is there a chance that it's the PCB itself, like it's damaged or was made wrong?<br /><br />Edit: I re-installed the Kazoo and now I've managed to get it to write the header, or what I assume it is, it tests okay and it installs and verifies that it wrote the header, but then the light goes from red to blank and when I try to go and write the 256kb .bin to the chip(s), it's still giving me a 116 error. I've looked around a little bit online and there's barely any information about this or the problems I am having online.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6327">Beji</a> — Mon Jan 06, 2014 4:11 pm</p><hr />
