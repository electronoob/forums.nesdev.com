<br />$28 or $27 are the closest to yellow to exist, but $28 looks like piss and $27 looks like gold, so there is no true yellow I guess.

<br />Colors $37 and $38 would have to be the closest thing to yellow. In your palette, color $37 is very yellow, but I've never seen an yellow like this on the NES.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />tokumaru, I think $2c and $3c in the palette you posted look like almost the same luminance ($3c looks only slightly brighter than $2c), so those definitely need to be adjusted.  Is $1d supposed to be brighter than $0f or exactly the same?  Most have $1d the same as $0f, others have it slightly brighter than $0f.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Changed "your palette" to "the palette you posted", since the palette tokumaru posted isn't his.  Sorry for the misconception, tokumaru.

<br />Technically, $01-$0c oscillate between $00 and $0d, so they do access $0d temporarily.  I guess when used as its own color (not for rendering other colors), the $0d voltage is long enough to cause problems in certain TVs.

<br />I would take pics of my industrial composite monitor I currently have my NES hooked up to, if only I had a DVD player that supported JPEG so that I could display the SMPTE test pattern to recalibrate it...

<br />Well, there are "recommendations" that all TVs should follow, those recommendations also define appropriate voltage levels and timing which apparently have been measured from the NES. So it is possible to get a palette from a perfectly calibrated TV by using the recommendation as a TV.
