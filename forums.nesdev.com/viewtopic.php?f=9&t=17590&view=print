It can't be fully remade until the CPU and PPU are accurately cloned though, but I think it's a step in the right direction. The Famicom/NES is in need of an open source and accurate clone. The idea is to make it in parts that can be mixed and matched in a cheap DIY solution.<br /><br />There are many different needs and wants, and personally I'd want to see an almighty Famirepro that beats the Analogue NT Mini:<br /><br />-Famicom controller ports (microphone compatibility)<br />-NES controller ports (all pins so dual Zappers etc work)<br />-Famicom 15-pin expansion port<br />-NES 48-pin expansion port<br />-Famicom 60-pin cartridge connector<br />-NES 72-pin cartridge connector<br />-NES universal lockout chip (for games that rely on it)<br />-Jailbar-free composite video<br />-NTSC CPU (various versions)<br />-NTSC PPU (various versions)<br />-PAL CPU (various versions)<br />-PAL PPU (various versions)<br />-RGB PPU (various versions)<br />-Famicom expansion audio compatibility<br />-NTSC/PAL modes<br />-Maybe more<br /><br />Or maybe better a port for the microphone so that any standard microphone can be used like on the Analogue NT.<br /><br />Now if there only were open source clones of the CPUs and PPUs.

For difference CPU/PPU versions you can have source codes and compile them for different versions. Also, with NTSC/PAL, and if a FPGA is used then you can upload the configuration for different versions too.<br /><br />Maybe of interest is this document I wrote: <a href="http://zzo38computer.org/textfile/miscellaneous/famiclone" class="postlink">http://zzo38computer.org/textfile/miscellaneous/famiclone</a> However, this is just a draft I wrote some time ago (although I corrected a few mistakes today), and other ideas are possible than what I wrote there.

But I'm not sure about decapping the more rare chips unless decapping technology somehow improves, at the same time they are the ones that needs to be documented the most. For die shrink updates without any differences in logic, I guess there's no reason to record both versions (but you might not know that until they are both decapped?).
