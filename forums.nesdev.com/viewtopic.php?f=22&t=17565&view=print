		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi!<br /><br />I'd like to show you INTO THE BLUE, a new game I just released. It's for the Game Boy, but I hope it is still not a problem to post it in this section. The goal of my project was to create a game that looks and feels like a commercial game from back in the day. The result is a puzzle game that plays similar to Tetris Attack.<br /><br />It's free, so please check it out on my website <a href="https://the-green-screen.com" class="postlink">https://the-green-screen.com</a>!<br /><br />Here are some screenshots:<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/7dml22ol87f71s4/Screenshot1.jpg" alt="Image" /> <img src="https://www.dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/jfgsxujul2c3eo6/Screenshot2.jpg" alt="Image" /> <img src="https://www.dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ni58e8g06iyvdnw/Screenshot3.jpg" alt="Image" /> <img src="https://www.dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/gox2u14qn91gmx5/Screenshot4.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I hope that you like it!

Banks 2 to 5 contain only music and sound data. I use a self-made music engine that stores all the music data uncompressed, so it is plausible that there is a lot of redundancy in these banks. With some compression the whole game would surely fit in 4 banks but I simply didn't care about the size of the ROM file.

The reason for this is probably that RGBDS fills empty space with something else. As already stated, there should only be code and data in banks 0 to 5, the rest should be empty. In banks 2 to 5 there should be some space left over in each bank. This is because I wanted to keep the data for each of the four songs (title screen plus three in-game songs) in one bank. The space after the respective song should be empty (which it apparently isn't).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">zzo38 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">This is cool!

If you want to get better, try to clear panels on the very right or left wherever you can and avoid to clear too much from the middle of the screen.

Catskull cartridges are only 32K and have neither an MBC nor battery RAM, and this limit has led developers of homebrew Game Boy games to omit battery RAM support from their game designs.<br /><br />Or is zzo38 playing on an EverDrive GB X5 or other flash cart with SRAM?
