Considering that the changes affecting the core of the emulator, I have tested many roms (tests and games) and it seems that everything is running smoothly, but if someone were to find some roms that gives problems with this release, please contact me.

	</div>I only had a mapper 218 devcart, but it'll work fine as almost anything (certainly 0, 7, &amp;c) as long as it provides CHR RAM (startup banks don't matter) and the last 2KiB of the iNES image are mapped from $F800-$FFFF.<br /><br />Any time you press a button, it uploads 0-14 bytes during vblank. U/D/L/R change those bytes. The leftmost one is the number of bytes. When uploading 8 to 14 bytes, Nestopia incorrectly shows sprites 0 and 1 reappearing after the frame that the button is pressed, but on hardware they remain concealed (because they're duplicates of sprites 2 and 3).<br /><br />The 2C07 does a bunch of things differently, so this doesn't pertain to it. (writes to $2003 don't corrupt OAM; sprite evaluation can never be fully disabled, and runs from scanlines 21-311. I don't know if the behavior I'm describing here, where leaving OAMADDR nonzero when sprite evaluation starts causes data to be copied over sprite 0 and 1 data.)<br /><br />If you want reference photographs, I can probably get around to that sometime in the next few days.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello, FHorse! I registered on this site to say that you've built quite an impressive emulator and I intend to use it as my primary one going forward. Your hard work is appreciated. I want to compliment you on your sound emulation particularly. Comparing back-to-back puNES's output with Nestopia shows yours to be both better-sounding and truer to a recording of my NES. I humbly have some feature requests/suggestions for you to consider as well.<br /><br />First, I'm surprised no one has asked for custom palettes. A palette editor and being able to save/load ones like Nestopia and Nintendulator allow would be great. That would take away the one real advantage Nestopia has over puNES, at least for my purposes.<br />Second, would it be possible to generate audio at higher sampling rates, most importantly 48 kHz? I wouldn't object to higher numbers being included as well, but 48 kHz is more compatible for many PCs and would eliminate the resampling that must be done on computers which only support that rate (although I acknowledge this number is dwindling) and make resampling much easier and more precise for those whose sound cards are set to 96 or 192 kHz.<br />Third, it was brought up a few times before and maybe you've just decided it's against your goal of faithfulness (relatively) to the real hardware, but configurable stereo panning for the sound channels would be extremely nice and a much better stereo method than channel delay. Plus it seems it would make a number of people happy.<br />And I second Schattenjager's idea for xBRZ filtering.<br /><br />Please keep up the excellent work!<br /><br />EDIT: I just caught a bug! In Tetris 2 + Bombliss, when playing Tetris the screen will screw up for a split second when your piece falls into place. It's rather annoying and doesn't happen on Nestopia. I'm using puNES Portable 0.85.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />FHorse, thanks for your consideration.  <img src="./images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" /> One more potential bug I noticed: is it supposed to continually grow in memory usage each time you open a ROM? With each new game opened it adds about 40,000 KB to my memory usage as displayed by Windows Task Manager and only closing the emulator resets it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Joe wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><a href="http://xkcd.com/386/" class="postlink">However</a>, it doesn't matter what frequency the audio is at if it needs to be resampled. Any good resampler (i.e. without audible artifacts) will end up doing the same work for any input sample rate, with the same precision. If anything, a lower input sample rate means less work because there is less input data.</div>But the math for resampling 48 kHz to 192 kHz is so much simpler than getting 44.1 to there. So, while I obviously have no capability to do any tests with puNES, it may be more efficient to generate more data and resample by simply multiplying by 2 or 4 than it is to generate less data and have to multiply by 4.35374149... I don't think it is quite the same precision as it's going to have to round if the number continues on for infinity. That won't create an audible artifact at 16-bit resolution, but it's less precise and also a problem that can just be avoided if 48 kHz is implemented.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Joe wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Besides, <a href="http://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html" class="postlink">you probably don't need sample rates above 48kHz</a>.</div>Right, I'm well aware of that, I've read Monty's article and watched his videos, frequently lurk HydrogenAudio, etc. Which is why I said 48 kHz is more important to add than any other. And if it were my program and it were easy to make it generate at 192 kHz too, I'd throw it in because why not? Some cards and even onboard audio are made for that and could perform best at that rate (though I doubt the difference would be audible on practically any), it gives some people a placebo that makes them happier with minimal effort, and whatever else. If it did take significant effort, then meh. I'd much rather work on configurable stereo.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
