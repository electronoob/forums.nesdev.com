		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Dendy Chronicles is a web series that tells story of unlicensed NES clones, known as Dendy, in Russia in 1990s and about games for it.
<br />
<br />Kinaman is a 23 years old russian guy and a retro gamer. He started to make retro video games reviews just recently, and already gained some local popularity. Some people call him 'russian video game nerd' and make related jokes, well, he is for sure. What makes him different from other local VG reviewers is the things he is talking about. Instead of just swearing all the time, he reminds us how crazy early console gaming experience was in Russia in the past. Major reason why I like to watch reviews of popular english-speaking VG reviewers is that they show me sort of an alternative reality, because here things were very different. I think it could be interesting for people outside of Russia to see an alternative reality too, that's why I decided to make english subtitles for Kinaman's videos.
<br />
<br />First three episoded dedicated to all the games about Mario that were released for Dendy. There are a bit more games than you could expect.

<br />How to use subtitles in YouTube player:
<br />
<br />You can enable them with the CC button at the bottom right, or, in case of the embed player, with the triangle button at the bottom right and then with CC button in the pop-up menu.
<br />
<br />To make subtitles background opaque that makes them easier to read, press B button on the keyboard. You also can change font size with +/- button, and there are other settings available under the CC button.

<br />It people want to see a Japanese perspective there are the game center CX which are quite interesting when they talk about history of specific game companies. But this is a commercial TV show so sometime you have to take it with a grain of salt.

I never thought they would promote Famiclones with that! Although there are 2 official Saint Seiya games for the Famicom...

<br />
<br />FWIW, the English subs are sufficient about 90% of the time.  Lots of grammatical mistakes, typos, and some phrases that could be rewritten to sound more eloquent -- if they need help cleaning them up, please let me know and I'll be happy to do the editing! -- but overall it was over an hour of total enjoyment for me.  (Oh, and my Russian is really, *really* bad, but there are certain sentences I can understand which I could translate better I guess; I sure as hell couldn't translate the entire thing!!!).  For example, the caption "Stolichnaya" (Столичная) should just read "(Stoli; Russian vodka)", because here in the US those small bottles are usually samplers, and contain different kinds of alcohols.  I doubt anyone would know what Stolichnaya is...
<br />
<br />This gives me a lot of insight to what Landy (of LandyNES) went through.  In fact, just moments after starting the video, I sent him an Email with said Youtube link.  I'm certain it will put a big smile on his face.  :-)
<br />
<br />But thank you for the links -- I had a wonderful time watching these.
