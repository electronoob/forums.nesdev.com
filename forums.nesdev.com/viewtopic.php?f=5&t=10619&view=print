		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I got a couple SNES in a junk lot and im having a frustrating controller issue on one of them. Which is an old SHVC-CPU-O1 with separate sound board and BA6592 encoder.<br /><br />The SNES plays games but controller does not work. <br />I know my controller works, it works on all my other SNES. The front panel is getting power as the LED lights. I tried switching the front panel for another one from a known good SNES, does the same thing. When I try the front panel from this SNES in an other one it works too. I tried reflowing the ribbon connector port on the motherboard. Changed nothing. Tested continuity for all connections between the two boards in case mobo connector is damaged. Still all good.<br /><br />I then verified the trace connections to the CPU and looks like all traces connect, I checked connections to Diodes DA1 to DA10. I tested said diodes with my multimeter and they appear good.  Seriously I fear that this is a damaged CPU. But its weird as everything else seems to work No1. Would be a great console to run Demos..  <br /><br />I am a bit out of other ideas right now so any suggestion is appreciated. Im kind of pissed as I happened to want an original release SNES with BA6592 encoder. <br /><br />I guess I should dig out an other controller and try this just in case..<br />Then will have to check circuit behavior during operation.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, on older boards the controllers are incompatible between regions, or so the internet claims. Those diodes are connected on one side to the clock line, and I suspect they might be in series, in effect turning the clock line into an open collector output, so the controller would need pull-up in order to work. You could look if your board has these diodes. One supposed way to get around the problem is to just bridge the diodes. I have no idea if that has other side effects, though.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://kyorune.com/modding/article.php?id=15">http://kyorune.com/modding/article.php?id=15</a><!-- m -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hmm that's good to know but all my hardware is NTSC-US. <br /><br />I made more tests this morning. I was trying the front panel from the defective SNES in another SNES and when I inserted the controller in the 2nd player port. The console was glitching and making weird noises so I stopped that. I thing There is a fault in the front panel after all. And maybe the thing damaged the SNES. I do not want it to damage another SNES so I put a warning sticker on it. <br /><br />I then tried putting a different, known good front panel in the faulty SNES and then tried Controller 2 with pocky &amp; rocky. The game booted but during the intro screen the game crashed ans screen went black. I reseted, same thing happened. I then Disconnected the controller, same thing happened but third time it left video glitches on the screen and glitching sounds.  <br /><br />And now it does not boot anymore. The LED lights but the console does nothing. Connector is clean and I tried several games. It wont work anymore. <br />I think the Console ( probably CPU? ) just borked <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Ill try it a bit later to see if letting it cool down can do something.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You probably blew the fuse. I think the one in the SNES should reset itself (a &quot;polyfuse&quot;); if not replace it with a 1.5A fast-blow fuse. (it's right next to the power switch). <br /><br />Ideally you'd be able to hunt down what blew the fuse using the finger (&quot;is it hot?&quot;) test. You might blow a few fuses along the way, though. (Better that than permanently killing the SNES). If you can't figure out what's wrong and just keep on blowing fuses, there are diagnostic techniques involving replacing the fuse with an appropriate incandescent light bulb (0.5A-1.5A and 4V-5V) such that when the short happens, the light bulb will brownout everything after it and protect them.<br /><br />At one point in the past I decided I wanted to replace my SNES's red power LED with a blue one (this was before people were putting blue LEDs in <em>everything</em> so it's not completely indefensible), but the front panel is a very solid module and the process of doing so slightly damaged the connectors, so it's been a little touchy. Resoldering all the points there and gently massaging the connectors helped some.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The SNES was still powering up with the LED lighting and all, just it was not playing any games. <br />I tried it one hour later and it worked again! So maybe this is indeed a self resetting fuse mechanism somewhere. <br /><br />I tried pocky and rocky again and it did the same glitch. So I changed game. It sems to work fine ( albeit no controller ) for some games but has problems in some others. <br /><br />Contra 3- No video after intro but sound works.<br />Zombies ate my neighbor - Not working at all<br />FFVI - All looks good<br />DK country - all looks good<br />RnR Racing all looks good<br /><br />The reason I wanted to play Pocky and rocky is because you can start the game with controller 2 but I then found Darius twin and controller 2 worked! At least the Start, arrows and A. But when I start new game it crashes, Black screen again. <br /><br />This SNES is very weird. Maybe there is a cold solder joint somewhere but I have another theory. Something is glitched in the Controller diode scheme on the motherboard( refer to redrawn schematics ) and the circuit acts as if a combination of many buttons are always pressed or even a horrendous binary sequence is sent which make some games glitch but not others. <br /><br />I will try to compare default Logic state of the controller inputs on the CPU to those of a good SNES.

THat is every connection is High minus JPSTR that is low. <br />That is while running a game. <br /><br />JPIO6:   H<br />JPIO7:   H<br />417.D1: H<br />417.D0: H<br />416.D1: H<br />416.D0: H<br />JPCLK1: H<br />JPCLK2: H<br />JPSTR:  L<br /><br />So that should not be what make some games Glitch...
