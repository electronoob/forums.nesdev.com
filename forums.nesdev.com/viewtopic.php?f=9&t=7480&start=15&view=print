<br />The main problem is that new PCs don't come with parallel ports anymore. Last time I was assembling a PC I had a really tough time finding a motherboard with a parallel port, and when I finally found it, it ended up not working with my Willem programmer.
<br />
<br />I believe that there are different communication protocols for the parallel port, and not all hardware and operating systems properly support the one used by the Willem. but still, even in my older PC, where the programmer used to work, it didn't work 100% of the time. There were times when it was hard to get the software to actually detect and acknowledge the thing.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Believe me, it's better to buy something a little more expensive that you know will be reliable than waste money on a paper weight that will not do anything you want it to. Those USB TOP programmers should be better than the parallel Willem. <strong>ANY</strong> USB programmer should be better than the parallel Willem.

<br />
<br />This pretty much hits it on the nose. The Parallel port isn't 1 standard connection. There are many different modes it can be in depending on the chipset of the motherboard (or expansion card sometimes). Many devices will only work properly on a specific mode. Some will work, but experience seemingly random problems. Others will not work at all. 
<br />
<br />In my experience with the Parallel Willem I could never get it to program or read anything for a long time. Then one day I did manage to get it to work on another PC but it didn't work with 27C801 chips, but did work with my 27C010 chips.

<br />Somehow I doubt Windows 7 would run on a 486... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />
<br />
<br />Seriously though qtoyoda, you have a new computer, that doesn't have a parallel port and is running Windows fucking 7. No old programmer will work on your PC, you need a new one, with a USB connection, please get that in your head. And even then not all USB programmers will work on Windows 7, so you have to ask the seller/read the manual before buying. I don't think you will find prices much lower than $50 though.

<br />He didn't say it, but I think this is a safe bet since he said he <span style="text-decoration: underline">needed</span> the 486 to use the programmer. I don't know if 486 computers could even have USB ports... I know that not even my first Pentium did, so I think it's highly unlikely that a 486 would have a USB port, or even a PCI slot where to plug an expansion card. Not fair of me to expect you to know that, since you weren't even born yet.
