		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm trying to get CHR bank switching working in my CNROM game.  Currently it works correctly in mesen, but not in fceux. I won't get a chance to try it on hardware until later this weekend, but regardless if it works on hardware, I'd like to know that it will work as expected on fceux.  Is there anything obvious here that I'm doing that would make it not work right?<br /><br />I've got 2 8k CHR banks, and my header is declared as:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.segment &quot;INESHDR&quot;<br />&nbsp; .byt &quot;NES&quot;,$1A&nbsp; ; magic signature<br />&nbsp; .byt 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; PRG ROM size in 16384 byte units<br />&nbsp; .byt 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; CHR ROM size in 8192 byte units<br />&nbsp; .byt $31&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; mirroring type and mapper number lower nibble<br />&nbsp; .byt $00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; mapper number upper nibble<br /></div><br /><br />To switch banks, I'm doing:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; lda #01<br />&nbsp; sta $8000<br /></div><br /><br />Both mesen and fceux report that it's mapper #3 with 2 8K CHR-ROM.  But fceux doesn't seem to want to switch to the 2nd bank.<br /><br />I'll test on my powerpak later tonight, but regardless, I'd like be able to figure out what I might be doing that makes them differ.<br /><br />Any guesses?

Address $8000 must contain $01 if you want this code to succeed. Most games on boards with bus conflicts just have a table with all possible values that can be written to the mapper somewhere in ROM, and that table gets used for all mapper operations. Some emulators ignore bus conflicts.<br /><br />EDIT: according to that wiki page, bus conflicts involving NES-era CPU and ROMs would result in 0s winning against 1s, so if your program starts at $8000, and you have a SEI there, SEI is opcode $78, a value whose bit 0 is 0, so this wins against the 1 you're trying to write, and the second CHR page never gets selected. Any even value at $8000 would cause this result in an emulator that simulates bus conflicts as suggested in the wiki. Also, as the wiki says, don't count on 0s winning against 1s, because different hardware (such as the PowerPak or FPGA consoles) could give different results.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, iNES mapper 3 is one of those examples where annoyingly there isn't really consensus among emulators as to whether it should have bus conflicts or not. I think there's basically one game that relies on it, and one game that doesn't. (Otherwise the official boards do have bus conflicts but I don't think there's any known bugs where it matters.)<br /><br />Also, &quot;test on hardware&quot; won't help with bus conflicts if your hardware is a PowerPak or something else that's not a discrete logic board, unfortunately.<br /><br />You can use a <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0_submappers#002.2C_003.2C_007:_UxROM.2C_CNROM.2C_AxROM" class="postlink">submapper</a> to specify explicitly that you want bus conflicts or not, but I'm not sure you'll find many emulators that support that at this point.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, if you're swapping to a known bank, that's one way to do it. It's a little less readable though, so if you have a complete bankswitch table somewhere already, better use that for consistency.<br /><br />It's even better for consistency if you use macros to handle mapper operations, since this will make mapper changes significantly easier, in case you want to reuse an engine for other projects or whatever. You could do something like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;selects a constant CHR bank or one specified in the accumulator<br />.macro SWITCH_CHR _Bank<br />&nbsp; .ifnblank _Bank<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; lda #_Bank<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sta BankswitchTable+_Bank<br />&nbsp; .else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; tax<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sta BankswitchTable, x<br />&nbsp; .endif<br />.endmacro</div><br />I have a bunch of these macros using different register combinations (in case I need to preserve certain registers) in a single file, so if ever need to mapper-hack my own programs to use a similarly-featured mapper, I can just change these macros.

Writing to a ROM location containing $FF will always work as intended.

But &quot;CPU wins (appearance of no bus conflicts but still potentially damaging)&quot;, &quot;ROM wins&quot;, and &quot;OR bus conlicts&quot; are also possibilities.<br /><br />If any of the ancient pure PMOS ROMs are large enough and fast enough to work in the NES, I would not assume AND bus conflicts would happen there.
