<br />
<br />I hate to be a pedant, but the RetroDuo <strong>is</strong> an emulator. There's really no advantage to ruling out all special chip games, losing all the standard emulator features (auto SRAM save, save states, rewind, filters, etc), getting lower compatibility and, most importantly, spending all that extra money when you could just use a PC emulator in its place.
<br />
<br />I'd strongly recommend you get a different model SNES off of eBay instead. Would probably even be cheaper given the used condition. No emulator can match the real SNES with a flash cart.

Wasn't expecting it to work on his either because I knew he had the exact same model, so I was surprised when it did. When I got back, I put it straight into my SNES again and no-luck.<br /><br />I remember I got my system new, and it was one of the last available around here. I sold my first in '96 then soon after, wished I didn't! Then there was one last batch of 'control decks' that were being sold brand new around here in 2000 for $40 each. I grabbed one off the shelf without a second thought. I'm guessing that since mine was one of the last, there was probably cost-cutting revisions in the hardware. If this is the case, there doesn't seem to be anything external on the system to indicate it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'd strongly recommend you get a different model SNES off of eBay instead.

<br />
<br />Yes, I will probably do that down the track if I don't have any luck with future software updates. I'm really after a 60 Hz NTSC system, but it is difficult and expensive to get one around here. I can find them easily on ebay but then I'm looking at twice the price of the system to get it shipped over here. I've heard the retro duo has quite accurate emulation, plus it is 60hz and has the option to run NES games, so thought it was definitely worth a look at.

It seems there is a SDRAM error and when i try to load a game, i get all kinds of errors about headers and stuff. I tried alot of games and they dont boot. So what's the problem here? my snes? the CF card they sent me? the powerpak itself?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, got the Powerpak 1.02 for Christmas, but I cannot make it work. I have a PAL SNES, 2/1/3, SNSP-001A(UKV) and a 2 GB Kingston CF (that works perfect with the NES Powerpak). 
<br />
<br />First of all, the CF only "works" if it's formatted to FAT32, because if I format the card to FAT then the Powerpak gives me a "CONFIG file not found" error. With FAT32, I can see the games list, but when I execute any of them, it just shows a black screen or it executes the game with a lot of graphic glitches and then it hangs, even with DMA=0.
<br />
<br />I think it can be a CF compatibility problem, but before spending 30+ â‚¬ in a Dane-elec one, I prefer to make sure this is the problem. Any ideas?

<br />One is SDTV output. PCs with Intel graphics usually don't have it without a $40 VGA-to-composite adapter. Another is the ability to use it and your TV in separate rooms at the same time. So unless it's cheaper than an Acer Aspire Revo nettop and a scan converter...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When I learned of the PowerPak, I was very enthusiastic about the possibilities it seemed to offer.
<br />With some experience of developing games and bootmenus as well as reverse-engineering on the SNES, I even looked into developing my own PowerPak bootmenu while I was waiting for my PowerPak to arrive.
<br />I was a bit disappointed when I received mine and have since not worked on the former anymore.
<br />
<br />I started to get worried when people reported problems with different SNES revisions.
<br />As for Compact Flash compatibility, most people report problems here. Personally, I went through 4 CF cards before finding one the PowerPak eventually decided to work with.
<br />It also fails to work with some SanDisk cards (inventors of the CF standard and usually among the best in spec conformity).
<br />
<br />When you finally find a compatible CF card and SNES, the PowerPak works quite well. ROM compatibility is good, Star Ocean 96M support is great!
<br />Summarizing my experience, I'd say that the PowerPak does not quite live up to the expectations and is a bit too expensive. It's great when it works, but the remaining issues should be adressed before I can recommend it to others without feeling bad about it.
<br />I really hope that these issues can be resolved in the future.

<br />of development the Powerpak is largely uninteresting - it is clearly aimed
<br />at gamers. If you want to do any kind of programming on the SNES get a
<br />quickdev16. At the moment that's by far the best option. Old HK backup
<br />units of course also work but they usually operate over parallel port and
<br />I hate that ;)
<br />
<br />The next thing is the price. I paid the $135 plus shipping. That is quite a
<br />lot of money. When I got the powerpak I found out it doesn't work....
<br />
<br />What do you do when something you ordered doesn't work ? Right, you
<br />mail to support. Unfortunately I didn't get any answers there. I ended up
<br />finding answers here in the nesdev forum. Surely the store website would
<br />be updated soon I thought. Strangely enough that never happened. After
<br />some time I realized that apparently I belong the unlucky percentage of
<br />people owning the "wrong" SNES version which isn't supported - I
<br />wonder if it is supported now, the website didn't say last time I checked.
<br />I sent several emails asking if the problem is going to be fixed soon, if I
<br />can expect it to be fixed at all etc. I never got any answer. I then mailed
<br />that I wanted to return my powerpack. I had to email several times
<br />before I got a reply to that.
<br />
<br />so .. sorry, but : long story short ...
<br />
<br />powerpak is expensive, doesn't work and retrousb service sucks.

I think that people have not read part of RetroUSB's site where he makes it pretty clear that it's a small operation and he isn't a retail chain and thus doesn't have 24/7 support. 
<br />
<br />I do think you are right that the SNES PowerPAK is more aimed at gaming than development. But it's hard to really market a development only device. Right now I use an old Game Doctor SF7 for my SNES needs with the good ol' parallel transfer. It's not the most ideal setup because it requires me to keep an old laptop around for transfers. And since if I were to develop anything for SNES it would still require a jump from my current PC with no parallel port transfer capability, to the laptop to be uploaded.
<br />
<br />I think that given more time the compatibility issues with PowerPAK will be worked out. It just seems it went to market a bit too soon. Although perhaps this will have a positive effect on those that were working on their own similar SNES carts using SD cards to encourage them not to abandon their projects.

What would I need to do in order to run it on my North American NTSC system?

Or will I need to buy an NTSC lockout chip for the PowerPak?

<br />Also, Could someone tell me how I check what 'SNES hardware revision' I am using, and what they mean? Sorry for my ignorance, SNES technology is not something I have really looked at in the past, but I'd really like to get the best experience out of my PowerPak.

<br />
<br />For all the people who can't get this to work, <strong>PLEASE, PLEASE</strong> clean your console connector before complaining. It isn't good enough to say that "my other games work fine".
<br />
<br />I doubt there is a good way to check for marginal physical contact in software. Stuff will fail in strange ways. Welcome to my day-job nightmare. Dirty connectors on communication cables causing just bizarre symptoms. Anyways.
<br />
<br />
<br />And d4s, I disagree with your assertion that the product is overpriced. For being quite a niche item, I doubt he's even going to make a profit for quite a while. Price out low-volume PCB pricing and assembly if any of you are skeptical. Nintendo could do this stuff because they contracted out to have made millions upon millions of these things. Maybe Europe could have been made to wait a bit longer (like they normally do) <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> as things got sorted out, because of the ridiculously high shipping costs.
<br />
<br />Not pointing at anyone, but if I was ever to offer for sale a product like this, there would not be the option of purchase without the media card. Those "people on a budget" are going to drain the most time, energy and resources. Plus, it's doing everyone a favor in the long run.

<br />
<br />To use your PowerPAK on a NTSC SNES you will need to remove the PAL CIC/Lockout chip and replace it with one you would find in a NTSC game cartridge. You don't need to remove any tabs, the cartridge is molded to fit any SNES slot.
<br />
<br />You can get chip revision numbers from some SNES games like the Lion King or Final Fantasy Mystic Quest with hidden cheat codes.
