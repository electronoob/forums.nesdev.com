		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Finally I had the time to test this.<br /><br />Well done, I like the level design. It feels non linear, and incredibly moody. The animations are quite good too, specially the main character's in wolf form. I loved how the camera follows the action, too.<br /><br />I didn't like the way you lose momentum, though. With time I learned how to deal with it, but somehow it didn't feel natural. Or maybe it is not that the player loses momentum completely, but the time it takes to gain it again.<br /><br />Another thing that IMHO should be polished is vertical screen transitions. There are many times when you don't jump with enough strength and you get several transitions in a row, which detracts from the experience. While it's not a perfect solution, I tend to solve such situations in my games by means of boosting vertical velocity artificially when changing screens upwards. That way 1.- it gives the player extra time to look for a landing platform and 2.- prevents such situations where you just didn't jump high enough from the screen below.<br /><br />Great job, nonetheless. The music is superb and the mood and athmosphere is great.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@frankengraphics: Yes, SELECT might be the better key to morph. (why did I change that? I cannot remember)<br />If you're refering to not pixel perfect background collision handling, then you're right. That's done on purpose to save valueable CPU time. Nevertheless, a slowdown might occur if you avoid killing enemies everyone is following you. But it should be rare - it's &quot;calculated risk by design&quot;...<br /><br />@tepples: Yes, I could reproduce the crash. There's a stupid bug in the startup code. Well, actually, the bug is very smart, but the programmer was stupid. Do you want to have a hotfix?<br /><br />@dougeff: No, but almost. It's a bankswitching problem, indeed.<br /><br />@na_th_an: Yes, you should not lose momentum when you continue to press the joypad in one direction. I'm definitely considering a fix, in case I am creating an updated version. Additionally, I tried to design the rooms that you don't have to jump vertically into another room. So hey, DON'T DO THAT! Listen to your mother, walk on the stairs carefully, don't jump on them... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Phew, this NES project is challenging. Thank you all for the feedback!!

It's that sometimes it's off by 8px blocks which means you can stand half inside a grid-bound 16x16 block. I mean to play this again soon (and this time be able to beat it, hopefully!). Would it help if i PM:ed you screenshots and descriptions any such occurrences i may come across?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Phew, this NES project is challenging.</div><br />It's quite an impressive scope this game has - and still, you managed to do it!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Cool game.<br /><br />Minor quibble: The red projectiles shot by the skeletony stone heads are way too dark, IMO. I can hardly see them against the black background with the palette I'm using. I would be worried that this might be an issue on some displays when playing on hardware. I think Haunted Halloween 86 had a similar problem with a deep red used in its backgrounds.
