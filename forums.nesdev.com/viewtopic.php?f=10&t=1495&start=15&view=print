What I meant is like, say you are checking $300-$3FF (What's on the screen when the scroll is #$00) for collision. When 16 pixels are scrolled, You will want to be checking $310-$40F, because it's 1 column ahead of what was just on screen. Do you understand?

<br />Actually... I don't. The way I see it, the character moves within the 2 screens that are loaded in RAM, as if it was a tiny (2 screen) level. Only that this level is updated as you move ahead.
<br />
<br />It's like the player constantly loops through these 2 screens, from the first to the second and back to the first, but by the time you get back to the first screen it has been reloaded with a new map, effectivelly making it the 3rd screen.
<br />
<br />I didn't understand what you said, because in my head, all movement, physics and collision if performed against the RAM screens. So, checking if the player has hit a wall is just a matter of converting the coordinates of the point you want to check from pixel units into metatile units (divide by 16, shift right 4 times) and directly check these coordinates in the loaded maps, to verify if the player hit a solid block or not.
<br />
<br />I don't see why you'd want to do such a broad check within a range as big as $300-$3FF, as you said. It sounds slow, though.
<br />
<br />Unless we are thinking of completelly different collision methods... what are you using?

<br />
<br />That is exactly what I'm trying to say. $300-$4FF act pretty much the same as the Name Tables, exept they have the metatile IDs instead of individual tile IDs.
<br />
<br />My collision code (I haven't written it yet, I'm trying to plan as much as possible before coding) is going to check which metatiles the sprite is around. This will be read through RAM. It's like what you were saying, I think.
