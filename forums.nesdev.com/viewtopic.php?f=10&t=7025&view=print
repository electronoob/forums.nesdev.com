Your program might still work if you don't though, since the stack pointer wraps around, as long as you don't use page 1 ($0100-$01FF) for anything else. But if you plan on using page 1 for other purposes besides the stack, or if you plan on accessing the stack using using index registers (LDA $0101, X; LDA $0102, X; etc.) you have to initialize it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">; Increments X, which rolls X over its max value back to 0.

<br />Yes, this is correct.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, unfortunately many code aimed at new programmers needlessly optimizes it, making the task of learning more difficult. Assembly is difficult enough as it is; save the optimizations until after you've learned how to initialize the NES.
<br />
<br />Another reason is to allow easy access to the stack via indexed addressing. Sometimes you push some things on the stack, and then want to access one of the earlier things without pulling everything back off. You do this by transferring S to X, and then using $100+offset,x to access earlier things. If the stack pointer might have wrapped since pushing those, this will fail.
<br />
<br />A final reason to initialize the stack pointer is consistency of behavior, in case your code ever depends ons value. Having it random makes debugging harder, since it's something that might differ without your knowledge.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, it's redundant. Sometimes you start with code that's known to work, then make changes that you are sure won't break it, and don't mind leaving some inefficiency if it means the program is easier to prove correct. Though here, it reduces clarity, because you wonder why it's doing a clear followed by a fill, whether there is something you aren't seeing.
<br />
<br />If I were doing that, I'd have no problem with using a standard memory clear and avoiding modifying it, and then doing the fill separately later in the code. It's a combination of a well-tested memory clear that you use in EVERY program, and some extra code that's easy to prove correct.
<br />
<br />So the coding style I use emphasizes correctness first, even if that sometimes results in inefficiencies. As long as they aren't in critical sections of code, it might not even have any noticeable impact on the program speed, and thus show that it was the right choice: trade some unimportant speed for always-important correctness and clarity.

<br />
<br />I though I found it on that Nerdy Nights tutorial... But upon review, I couldn't find this error. Perhaps I screwed something up somehow, and in that case I apologize for the trouble.
