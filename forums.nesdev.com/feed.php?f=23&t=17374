But it's a goal to shoot for.  (Also, you'd want some high-quality rescaling tools to minimize manual rework.  These sprite sheets are not small.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I think that at 256x224 the image gains nothing without deactivated scanlines when you have to redraw graphics.<br /></div><br />Your Final Fight example shows identical-sized graphics - no rescaling - with nothing at all of interest in the areas that got blacked out.  (And it still looks nicer without the black bars when rescaled to 4:3.)  Metal Slug is not like that.  When five enemies with bazookas parachute in off the top of the screen, it's better to be able to see them right away.<br /><br />But your <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=17374&amp;start=105#p222697" class="postlink">earlier example</a> was rescaled instead of just chopped.  That way you can fit all the action in, but you absolutely do lose detail.  Losing detail is inevitable because the SNES can't do 304-dot scanlines, and using 512-dot scanlines is impractical for this game.  But keeping the detail loss to a minimum is (I think) a reasonable goal.<br /><br />Letterboxing the screen is absolutely an option.  A slight trim (8 pixels or so) might not even require graphics rescaling.  But it does make the game less accurate and less impressive (and it makes the graphics more difficult to convert because if you have to rescale vertically too, you get attribute clash in both axes).  If it's possible to do a good job without letterboxing, then it should be done without letterboxing.<br /><br />The Street Fighter games on SNES suffered a fair bit of detail loss because they were redrawn for a shorter screen height.  I'd rather not have to do that.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I see an opportunity of having more than 20KB of tile animations per frame, deactivating scanlines, and functioning at 30fps.<br /></div><br />Okay, yes, but do we <em>need</em> that?  Animation delays, animation frameskipping, animation-induced slowdown - all of these combined <em>might</em> be less obvious and intrusive than letterboxing, and result in a better experience.  If they do, then we don't need letterboxing.  If they don't, then we may have to trim the screen.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />640 tiles per frame is terrifying, and i bet all you want that only a very few times you will need to come closer to that cipher.<br /></div><br />The SNES can only address 16 KB of sprite data at a time, unless you change where it looks for sprite data partway down the screen, which is almost impossible to do intelligently except in very specific cases (mostly using sprites as a fake BG layer).  Some of the animation in the game is 30 fps, but a lot of it isn't (and during the crazy sections where the most stuff is happening, the game tends to slow down anyway).  It's entirely possible that 20 KB per frame is overkill for this game.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />How much it will costs to the cpu all that stuff about predictive animation, double buffers, etc?.<br /></div><br />I don't think either predictive animation or double buffering is appropriate for this game.  Double buffering eats VRAM that could be used for more sprites and/or BG tiles, and predictive animation doesn't work properly without double buffering.<br /><br />As for what I have suggested - delaying unimportant animation cels, skipping them if they get delayed too much (and if the previous one wasn't skipped), slowing down to take an extra VBlank if important cels don't fit - I don't think it would be all that onerous.  You'd just have to check every metasprite cel to see if it's important (you could probably just figure it out beforehand and store an importance bit in ROM), upgrade to &quot;important&quot; if the previous cel was skipped, and do the DMA allocation accordingly.  A dynamic VRAM engine already exists (written by psycopathicteen) that takes 20-30 scanlines per frame to allocate 4 KB of sprite DMA; I'm not sure if it spills unallocated data to the next frame or just ignores it...<br /><br />Now, a re-port of Street Fighter Alpha 2 might make good use of predictive animation and double buffering.  It shouldn't be prohibitive CPU-wise; the Haunted games on NES (programmed by tepples) use these techniques in the context of a side-scrolling beat-em-up, and it seems to me that the extra CPU load associated with these techniques should scale more with the number of metasprites being animated than with the amount of graphics data involved.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6595">93143</a> — Wed Aug 08, 2018 4:28 am</p><hr />

I don't know about that.  It's a really obvious glitch, and as far as I'm aware it occurs nowhere in the commercial library (unlike, say, the cheese grater effect, which is acceptable because Konami did it first).  I've only seen it in an early draft of psycopathicteen's Bad Apple video, and it looked pretty bad.<br /><br />EDIT:  Okay, maybe I was wrong.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8ph2OVqZeM" class="postlink">This video</a> seems to suggest that it can happen even in Zelda 3.  I honestly don't recall ever seeing it, but maybe that's because it's never big enough to make it past the bezel, which you really can't count on with Metal Slug...<br /><br />If it were to happen only once every now and then, it might not be too noticeable, but with this game you've got a lot of objects that require continuous animation and stay on the screen for quite a while, so the effect would probably be almost continuous in spots.  Much better to use real letterboxing if it comes to that.<br /><br />In my mind, single-frame animation jitter would look better (you're going to need it anyway if you're spreading updates over multiple frames without double buffering), although I could be wrong and it should be tested at some point.  Slowdown would surely be acceptable too, since players know what it is and are frankly expecting it.  Furthermore, animation-induced slowdown wouldn't need to stack with processing-induced slowdown if the game were programmed right (ie: if the processing took too long <em>and</em> the animation engine was overloaded, you'd still only lose one frame), and I'd expect them to overlap a fair bit in real gameplay, so the impact could be minor.<br /><br />On the flip side, extending VBlank situationally as you suggest might actually trigger slowdown, since it reduces your compute time for the frame, and if you're in a situation where you need it you could well be on the edge CPU-wise too.  In that situation, you'd have been better off just delaying the next frame and taking one more VBlank to finish the updates.  (To be fair, this is a bit of a corner case and doesn't prove much...)<br /><br />...<br /><br />It strikes me that predictive loading would be of limited utility in Metal Slug.  If we aren't double buffering, any changes would become visible immediately, so all predictive loading would do is permit animation frames to be slid both forward and backward in time to take advantage of gaps in the DMA schedule.  But you wouldn't want to load a cel early unless you knew that the <em>next</em> frame was going to be a doozy, and how would you know that before running the frame?  I suppose you could simply project all current animations out to the next frame and see if they overload it, which would prevent all animations from running one frame early during sparse segments...  But is the additional bandwidth leveling worth the CPU cost to do that?  Especially considering that with 30 fps/no double buffering, half the animations are <em>already</em> running one (60 fps) frame early even without predictive loading?<br /><br />It also occurs to me that it's probably acceptable to outright drop an intermediate animation frame, as long as it's already become obvious what the actor in question is doing.  This could free up bandwidth for more important updates if things are really busy for multiple frames.<br /><br />...<br /><br />I sure do like typing...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6595">93143</a> — Mon Aug 06, 2018 1:05 am</p><hr />

All this talk about predictive animation and animation getting out of synch, but how jarring would it be to force VBlank down the screen for one frame, far enough to get all the graphics transfered?

I thought I had shown in a picture that you can use BG3 for the middle layer in that scene in conjunction to a window layer, and you'd have enough color for everything but the rocky edge of the BG layer and a few highlights on the tree trunks that you could use a few 16x16 sprites for. By some stroke of luck, the layer doesn't actually extend up to where the status bar is.<br /><br />Something that's a real pain though is that the wooden fortress is really two layers in of itself. Luckily, you can get by a lot of it by messing with tile priorities, but there are some parts you are going to need sprites for. I think both front and back parts use the same palette, so you might be able to get away with an Equinox style sprite masking system so sprites don't need to be there all the time (so you could potentially save vram space). There is so much layering in this scene that even the Neo Geo even displays sprite pixel per line dropout with the last explosion, but that's also because they weren't smart about lowering it. (The waterfall layer is presumably loaded in its entirety even while most of it is occluded).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6683">Drew Sebastino</a> — Sun Jun 17, 2018 4:11 pm</p><hr />

Sure. With 16-bit M/X, the effects of fast B bank seem to be very approximately equal to fast K bank. And with a standard LoROM cart, you can even use cart RAM with fast timings.<br /><br />But with 8-bit M/X, the benefits of fast B bank are only roughly 1/3 ish of fast K bank. It's not clear whether that difference is big enough to matter.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Sun Jun 17, 2018 4:05 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Unlike on the NES, where there would have been a clear advantage to overflowing regular code into save RAM, on the SNES it's most often exclusively for save data.<br /></div><br />I have a reason.  Speed.<br /><br />My game uses an H-IRQ to pull off an elaborate raster effect, and it needs to run at 6 master cycles per byte to get everything done within the available window.  Right now I use a trampoline in shadow RAM to get into a FastROM bank, but the IRQ plus a full slate of HDMA eats the bulk of the CPU time available during active display, and saving a JML per line plus two master clocks on every byte accessed on the stack might actually be worth it, even aside from the small speedup to regular code.<br /><br />This is obviously an edge case, but it may actually be topical because there's a section in Mission 1 of Metal Slug that seems to want three 4bpp BG layers.  And with the way it's arranged, it may be possible to use a combination of sprites and window masking to cover a scroll split executed with an H-IRQ.  You might say it's overkill to add a custom SRAM configuration just to avoid having to reduce the bit depth of a BG layer, and you may be right.  This particular section isn't even that busy, so it may very well not even be helpful (other than the small general speedup from having fast work RAM and a fast stack, and when porting Metal Slug to the SNES, any advantage is worth looking at).<br /><br />...it may be possible to use sprites for the waterfall once the beam is below the HUD.  There's not much else going on in that section, and the destructible part of the wooden structure is offscreen before the bulk of the waterfall comes into view.  The ship and cliffs look like they'd reduce to multipalette 2bpp pretty well if you gave them a bit of HDMA and maybe some bridging sprites.  This could be a good candidate for an OBSEL split, particularly if we decide to try to use real colour blending on the near-field waterfalls instead of checkerboard dither...  it looks to me like the cliff on the left is out of view before the near waterfalls overlap any part of the far waterfalls, so the latter could be switched back to a 4bpp BG to permit layer blending.<br /><br />I fear the water is going to have to slow down a bit.  Even with tile reuse (and there are repeated elements in that far waterfall), there's just not enough bandwidth, or VRAM, to do 60 fps without butchering the graphics...  wait, could it be possible to use colour math to combine a static 4bpp cliff+water background with mostly 2bpp animation?  With enough tile reuse, the whole animation might fit into a useful amount of VRAM, or at least enough could be cached to leave the bulk of the bandwidth for the foreground.  Still not hitting 60 fps, but might be faster than trying to use 4bpp for everything...  One could also exploit the VRAM gate settings to overwrite half the bitplanes in a 4bpp tile set, but while that does reduce the bandwidth requirements, it also prevents compact tile caching/switching (which there may not be room for).  Also, arranging tiles so they can be replaced selectively without a ton of overhead is harder when using 16x16 BG tiles.  Using 8x8 tiles allows finer colour control but wastes VRAM on map data.  Lots of work to figure out the best way to do this...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6595">93143</a> — Sun Jun 17, 2018 3:43 pm</p><hr />

It uses 128kB of SRAM, but it's split up into 8kB banks because it is using an existing cartridge memory layout.
