Best to leave that stuff alone. <br /><br />They've also opened up a lot about their past development process in the Iwata asks articles... and recently gotten slammed for it by some of their investors. And not for divulging secrets, but being in their opinion ineffective marketing. It's all about $$$. How can you cause Nintendo to lose money? That's what they're focused on.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've brought this up before in another thread, but I'll mention it here:<br /><br />I don't believe for one second that because these are classic consoles from 20+ years ago (read: not being sold any more) that Nintendo doesn't care.  I ask folks to keep an open mind (I know I am), but hear me out:<br /><br />There was a period of time after the SNES's downfall (essentially with the release of the GameCube, *possibly* the N64 but I think that's still too soon) where there wasn't anything going on publicly (or within companies) involving classic consoles.  However, folks need to remember that with the GameCube and GBA, Nintendo released an officially classic games on them (Zelda 1/2 on the GC, and all those classic first-gen NES games on the GBA).  Emulation and classic games were starting to make a comeback then -- emulators were really ramping up, lots of people (including myself) pissed off with quality of 3D games and/or just didn't like 3D (also includes myself).<br /><br />What Nintendo (and not just them either) did was re-establish a socially proliferated form that those classic games and classic systems still play a very important role with regards to both their income (not literally any more, but indirectly) as well as their intellectual property.<br /><br />If you haven't noticed, it's still actively going on.  Things like the Virtual Console (I think it's called that?) and some other things on the 3DS as well.  They're *still* doing it, and it's not going to go away.<br /><br />So if someone tells you &quot;eh they don't care about classic consoles any more&quot;, IMO, think again.  And I can assure you that in a legal case (though I am not a lawyer) against someone who dispensed private/internal documentation from 20+ years ago, that point would be brought up as at least one justification point.<br /><br />No I don't think Nintendo (or other companies) have some kind of conspiracy theory going on (i.e. release classic console games on present console to retain IP ownership etc.) -- I think their focus is on the money and how that *does* make them money.  But in the United States, anything that makes money, when it comes to courts/legal cases, plays a huge role in the case.  &quot;Oh, so the person distributing 20+ year old stuff basically causes your company to lose money today?  Well then, that changes everything!&quot;<br /><br />Anyway that's the opinion I've held for quite some time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Alright Koitsu<br /><br />I respect your opinion. And won't be one to wreck what you have going on here. You're right about the scent of money, and the &quot;fact finding&quot; that goes on pretrial, and that it would most likely be a Civil vs Criminal case. And that Civil cases are almost rigged to come to some sort of settlement that makes the defendant pay something.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think though that probably the real reason behind this argument is more the fact that the docs can be used to make <em>new</em> stuff (which Nintendo indeed wouldn't care about), and there isn't much point taking them down it to stop emulation of old games because, well, they're already emulated anyway (so the docs are really only useful for new stuff at this point).<br /><br />The real issue is that Nintendo is known to be extremely strict and will be willing to sue whenever given the chance.
