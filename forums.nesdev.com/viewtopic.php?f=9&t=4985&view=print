		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Recently I've been finding myself wanting to test my platformer on real hardware more, and my cousin, Tepples, isn't over here with his PowerPak all the time... I want a PowerPak of my own, but the price is upsetting, so I was wondering if an MMC1 board, an EPROM writer, an EPROM chip, and two 8k RAM chips would be cheaper or more expensive than a PowerPak...

<br />$10 MMC1 board with CHR RAM and WRAM (Zelda etc)
<br />$4 Flash chip, socket
<br />$40-50 Flash programmer
<br />
<br />Another option for fast cycle testing would be the CopyNES + PowerPak Lite, but that is still in the price range of the PowerPak.

<br />I see. I do want to have some fun with some other boards too, not just the MMC1, and I'm too sqeamish about taking old, no longer made hardware apart... I think I might still have enough money left over from Christmas for a PowerPak, or at least close to it, after subtracting the money I spent on my TI-84, and there really is nothing else I need to buy at the moment, so I suppose I might as well just get a PowerPak...
<br />...Now to wait until I can get Tepples to help me through getting one.

<br />
<br />For example, in Japan, the only "cheap" rom burner I found was easily 160$. Then you add the flash eeprom that I had to order online because nobody had them around here at 7$ a pop, then you have to get some donor carts, get a soldering iron and remove the chips, put some socket etc.
<br />
<br />Now, if you take into consideration all the time you will need to invest to do your dev carts... If you goal is just to test very fast what you did on a real nes, the powerpak is the way to go.  Only when you need an exotic mapper that you will need to do it with a real cart.

<br />
<br />For multiple-game playback, flash based devices are more suited to consoles which may have a static mapper such as Game Boy. NES is more suited to RAM based devices since the mapper must be reprogrammed from one game to the next and many games require CHR RAM already. Programming a flash based mapper (CPLD) is also slow, (as is programming a flash ROM,) so you wouldn't wouldn't be able to cycle through games as rapidly or with a finite write endurance as thoughtlessly as you would on a PowerPak.

<br />
<br />The powerpak can't handle *all* board types either though, if you want certain board types your only option is a donor board.
<br />
<br />Also, since the powerpak emulates mappers, I believe it is possible that there are differences in rom behavior between running on the powerpak and an actual board.
