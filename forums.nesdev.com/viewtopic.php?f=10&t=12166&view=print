		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello, recently I have switched over to ca65, and need a bit of help. <br /><br />My original post can be found on Nintendoage under the username MadnessVX: <a href="http://nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?StartRow=451&amp;catid=22&amp;threadid=103138" class="postlink">http://nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?StartRow=451&amp;catid=22&amp;threadid=103138</a> but I feel I can get a bit more technical help on this forum!<br /><br />I am trying to setup the Sunsoft 5B mapper, and need to know if I am setting up my configuration file correctly. How I currently have it setup, it assembles without it spitting errors at me, but I still doubt its right. If needed here is what it currently looks like:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">MEMORY {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ZP:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;start = $00,&nbsp; &nbsp; size = $0100, type = rw, file = &quot;&quot;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OAM:&nbsp; &nbsp; start = $0200,&nbsp; size = $0100, type = rw, file = &quot;&quot;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; RAM:&nbsp; &nbsp; start = $0300,&nbsp; size = $0500, type = rw, file = &quot;&quot;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; HDR:&nbsp; &nbsp; start = $0000,&nbsp; size = $0010, type = ro, file = %O, fill = yes, fillval = $00;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PRG:&nbsp; &nbsp; start = $6000,&nbsp; size = $A000, type = ro, file = %O, fill = yes, fillval = $00;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CHR:&nbsp; &nbsp; start = $0000,&nbsp; size = $2000, type = ro, file = %O, fill = yes, fillval = $00;<br />}<br /><br />SEGMENTS {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ZEROPAGE: load = ZP,&nbsp; type = zp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OAM:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; load = OAM, type = bss, align = $100;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; RAM:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; load = RAM, type = bss;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; HEADER:&nbsp; &nbsp;load = HDR, type = ro;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CODE0:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;load = PRG, type = ro,&nbsp; start = $6000;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CODE1:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;load = PRG, type = ro,&nbsp; start = $8000;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CODE2:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;load = PRG, type = ro,&nbsp; start = $A000;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CODE3:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;load = PRG, type = ro,&nbsp; start = $C000;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CODE4:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;load = PRG, type = ro,&nbsp; start = $E000;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; RODATA:&nbsp; &nbsp;load = PRG, type = ro;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; VECTORS:&nbsp; load = PRG, type = ro,&nbsp; start = $FFFA;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; TILES:&nbsp; &nbsp; load = CHR, type = ro;<br />}</div><br /><br />Then i still need to make 8 1KB banks for my tiles, correct? I'm still new to ca65 in general, and just branched off from NESASM due to (I feel like) it being difficult to set up for this mapper. Thanks for your time! And hello by the way!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />First question: why Sunsoft 5B? (extra sound? fine CHR banking? extra simultaneous PRG?)<br /><br />Now a few other things:<br />* Despite the header specifying the amount of PRG as a number times 16KiB, almost all mappers have to be a power of two in size. There are only a very few exceptions; most are multicarts like Action 52. If you simply want more than 32 KiB of code resident at a time, you might consider looking at <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NROM-368" class="postlink">NROM-368</a>.<br />* ca65's linker file specifies what address a given item will be placed at. This is most often different from where in the ROM file it is! This is entire point behind the “mapper“ hardware, it “maps“ certain parts of the ROMs to various parts of the CPU's and PPU's memory.<br />* Similarly, you are not restricted to only the 40 KiB of PRG or 8 KiB of CHR that mapper 69 provides. The .NES format lets you specify as little as 16 KiB PRG (although that would be a little silly) and 8 KiB of CHR, and the hardware allows you specify up to 256 KiB of each.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />$A000 is not a valid PRG size for two reasons:<br /><br />1. The iNES format requires a PRG size in 16k increments, as specified in your header. (This has nothing to do with the 5B specifically, it's just the file format's specification.)<br /><br />2. Actual PRG-ROM chips would be in power-of-two sizes.<br /><br /><br />I would recommend creating one MEMORY region for each 5B bank, and then you can create one ore more SEGMENT to inhabit these memory regions. Since the 5B uses 8k banks, I'd suggest specifying 64k of PRG-ROM in the iNES header, and defining 8 banks in the MEMORY regions:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; PRG0: start = $6000, size = $2000, type = ro, file = %O, fill = yes, fillval = $00;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PRG1: start = $6000, size = $2000, type = ro, file = %O, fill = yes, fillval = $00;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PRG2: start = $6000, size = $2000, type = ro, file = %O, fill = yes, fillval = $00;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PRG3: start = $6000, size = $2000, type = ro, file = %O, fill = yes, fillval = $00;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PRG4: start = $8000, size = $2000, type = ro, file = %O, fill = yes, fillval = $00;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PRG5: start = $A000, size = $2000, type = ro, file = %O, fill = yes, fillval = $00;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PRG6: start = $C000, size = $2000, type = ro, file = %O, fill = yes, fillval = $00;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PRG7: start = $E000, size = $2000, type = ro, file = %O, fill = yes, fillval = $00;</div><br /><br />In this example, only PRG7 needs to have that specific start address. The rest of them should specify the start address where you intend to map that bank.<br /><br />After this you need at least one segment per bank that you want to use. Something like:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; CODE0: load = PRG0, type = ro;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CODE1: load = PRG1, type = ro;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CODE7: load = PRG7, type = ro;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; RODATA0: load = PRG0, type = ro;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; RODATA1: load = PRG1, type = ro;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; RODATA7: load = PRG7, type = ro;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; VECTORS: load = PRG7, type = ro, start = $FFFA;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br /></div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />lidnariq: Yeah, I want to use this mapper mostly for the extended audio. Everything else it can do is a bonus though. <br /><br />Thanks both of you (and Shiru) for helping clarify things. So if I understand correctly, let's say I have a 128K rom chip.(For this project, ill stick with 64k which I think is the max the mapper can take. Still get confused with KB vs kB. Lemme know if this is wrong as well.) I need to specify that size in the ines header. Then I make 16 prg banks in the memory region with the address $E000 being the only one without other banks mapped to the same address. e.g. I can have PRG0 and 1 mapped to address $6000, 2 and 3 mapped to $8000, etc... Then I need to have a segment for every bank of memory. And I assume it is a similar process with the CHR?<br /><br />Once i get things set up properly, I'll need to figure out how to use the Command and Parameter register to bank between these segments. <br /><br />Hope that's right, some of these things I have learned the past year took forever to click with me sometimes. Last question: I see you are making RODATA segments for every CODE segment. Whats the importance of this?<br /><br />Thanks again everyone!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I presumed that you created RODATA because you separate your code from your read only data via segments. If you weren't using your RODATA segment, then get rid of all of them, I suppose?<br /><br />The reason I suggested more than one of them is that it is important which bank any particular piece of data goes into. Make sure the bank with the data is paged in at the same time as the code that needs to access it. If you don't want to worry about it you can put the code and data in the same bank, or put the data in the fixed bank (though that space tends to be precious).<br /><br />Anyhow, nothing wrong with putting your data in the CODE segments if you don't want a separate RODATA segment.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello, I have a few more questions regarding this mapper I'm trying to use. Now that I have the banks setup with ca65, (huge thanks to you guys) I'm having trouble actually using the mapper.<br /><br />As I understand it, I'm supposed to write to two addresses to configure the mapper: the Command Register ($8000) and the Parameter Register ($A000). So if I want to map chr bank $0 to ppu $0000 to $03FF, would I write something like:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; lda #$00<br />&nbsp; sta $8000<br />&nbsp; sta $A000<br /></div><br />But, this leads me to my next question: How does it know which bank is 0? Or in the case of having multiple prg banks mapped at $6000 like rainwarrior showed me, would all I have to write to switch to bank prg1 from prg0 be:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; lda #$08<br />&nbsp; sta $8000<br />&nbsp; lda #$01<br />&nbsp; sta $A000<br /></div><br />Finally, will I need to configure all the banks at reset and every time I wish to swap banks?<br /><br />I tried to follow gimmick in the FCEUX SP debugger, but it seems to contradict what I thought was right. example being is seems to do this: (I just made the program halt at every write to $8000, and wrote down what was being written)<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">$8000 = #$0D<br />$A000 = #$00 irq disabled<br /><br />$A000 = #$80 irq counter enabled<br />$A000 = #$00 irq disabled<br /><br />$8000 = #$0D<br />$A000 = #$00 irq disabled<br /><br />$8000 = #$0C nametable mirroring<br />$A000 = #$0D 1101 = horizontal mirroring<br /><br />$8000 = #$09 prg bank 1<br />$A000 = #$07 0000 0111<br /><br />$8000 = #$09 prg bank 1<br />$A000 = #$1B 0001 1011<br /><br />$8000 = #$0C nametable mirroring<br />$A000 = #$00 vertical<br /><br />$8000 = #$0D irq control<br />$A000 = #$00 irq disabled<br /><br />$8000 = #$0E irq counter lo byte<br />$A000 = #$EADA <br /><br />$8000 = #$0F irq counter hi byte<br />$A000 = #$EADF <br /><br />$8000 = #$0D irq control<br />$A000 = #$81 enable counter decrement, generate irqs<br /><br />$8000 = #$00 chr bank 0<br />$A000 = #$E1<br /><br />$8000 = #$01 chr bank 1<br />$A000 = #$E2<br /><br />$8000 = #$02 chr bank 2<br />$A000 = #$E3<br /><br />$8000 = #$03 chr bank 3<br />$A000 = #$E4<br /><br />$8000 = #$04 chr bank 4<br />$A000 = #$E5<br /><br />$8000 = #$05 chr bank 5<br />$A000 = #$E6<br /><br />$8000 = #$06 chr bank 6<br />$A000 = #$E7<br /><br />$8000 = #$07 chr bank 7<br />$A000 = #$E8<br /><br />$8000 = #$09 prg bank 1<br />$A000 = #$07<br /><br />$8000 = #$0A prg bank 2<br />$A000 = #$18<br /><br />$8000 = #$0A prg bank 2<br />$A000 = #$18<br /><br />$8000 = #$09 prg bank 1<br />$A000 = #$1B<br /><br />$8000 = #$0A prg bank 2<br />$A000 = #$00<br /><br />etc...etc...

The Sunsoft 5 mappers support a PRG bank size of 8 KiB and a CHR bank size of 1 KiB. So you could think about the total amount of available memory as being 32 <em>banks</em> of PRG, and 256 banks of CHR.<br /><br />When you write a number to the banking register, what you're doing is <em>selecting the section of ROM the CPU sees</em>. See wikipedia: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_switching">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_switching</a><!-- m --><br /><br />So when Gimmick! writes $E1 to CHR Bank 0, it's saying &quot;please use bank $E1 when the PPU reads from $0000 through $03FF&quot;, or to multiply it, &quot;please use the 1 KiB of CHR ROM starting at 0x38400 when the PPU reads from $0000 through $03FF&quot;

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Gimmick! specifically has 128k of CHR ROM, so the high bit of the CHR bank choice is ignored. Thus bank $E1 is the same as bank $61 for gimmick.<br /><br />Since CHR is banked in 1k pages with this mapper, the location of the chosen page will be a multiple of 1024 bytes into the CHR-ROM section of your file. Bank $00 will be the CHR-ROM at 0 bytes, $01 at 1024, $02 at 2048, etc...<br /><br />Yes, you will need to set up all the banks after reset or power on. Their state is not known/guaranteed at power on, and likely unknown at reset. After that, they will persist until you change them; you don't have to change all of them at once, you can change just one if you like.
