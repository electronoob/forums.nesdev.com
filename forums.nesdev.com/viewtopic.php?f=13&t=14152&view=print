So this might be a good time for me to rearrange the forums to take advantage of a feature new in phpBB 3: third-level forums.<br /><br />nesdev.parodius.com ran phpBB 2, which had a 2-level hierarchy: a site contains categories, and a category contains forums. are &quot;NES / Famicom&quot;, &quot;Other&quot;, and &quot;Site Issues&quot;. In 2012, when Parodius Networking was wound down, nesdev.com moved to a different server running phpBB 3. A phpBB 3 site has top-level forums, which contain second-level forums, with no fundamental difference between forums at different levels. A &quot;category&quot; is just a forum that has sub-forums and doesn't let users create topics directly inside it. Inside of a second-level forum I can make third-level forums.<br /><br />I was thinking move Reproduction inside Hardware, GB and SNES inside Other Retro Dev, and the Japanese, Chinese, and Middle East forums inside International. Then I could make the compo forum inside Homebrew Projects.<br /><br />Second? Object?

Although that's a homebrew rom, it's specifically music being played with no other interaction.<br /><br />A good rule of thumb is to seek the most specific forum and walk backwards from there, ending at &quot;General Stuff&quot; when there's nowhere else.

A good rule of thumb...</div><br />I didn't literally mean that I needed help choosing a category. My point was that it's annoying because it's relevant to multiple categories, and this is true for <em>a lot</em> of posts on this board. Forcing something into one category hides it from others.<br /><br />I guess my ideal board would filter posts by category tags instead of imposing exclusive organization on the posts themselves. A tree structure would be great for the categories themselves, e.g. any post tagged &quot;2016 compo&quot; would end up in the &quot;homebrew&quot; stream. This is just a pipe dream, though, obviously we must make do with what we've got.<br /><br />The way things are structured here, though, puts posts themselves in very exclusive categories. You don't get to see &quot;SNESdev&quot; posts in the &quot;Other retro dev&quot; stream, they are effectively separate forums, and the tree structure is totally wasted, because the only thing that's really in a tree is the presentation of links between forums. The posts themselves are not functionally acting as if they had a hierarchy.<br /><br />Because of the lack of effective structure for posts themselves, an excess of categorization makes it harder for someone interested in multiple topics to get to the information they want. Though there is the &quot;unread posts&quot; feature that bypasses the categories entirely, it is only useful for people like me who are willing to open every thread; if this board had higher traffic I wouldn't find it a useful feature at all, and I think for people who read this board less frequently that tipping point is much lower. (e.g. <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=14155" class="postlink">this thread</a> about the SNESdev subforum).<br /><br />Though, if &quot;view unread posts&quot; was customizable and could omit undesired subforums, that would be pretty helpful in mitigating this organizational problem.<br /><br /><br />Anyhow, my objection is still weak. I do have an opinion on it, but I don't really feel that strongly about it, mainly because the unread posts feature is still good enough for me (but it's fragile).
