<br />
<br />sorry couldn't resist.
<br />
<br />i have been working on PCM for NES too without much success though.
<br />
<br />I'd link the PCM's i made for NES but i lost the link. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />(they sell plushies now!, its holiday time click thru to buy people presents at the store. just a lil help from me with holiday presents sorry. x.x)
<br />
<br />-edit- will upload a link to my NES friendly PCMs when i find the link sorry!

I threw the 80's Doctor Who theme through Audacity (MP3 &gt; 8KHz 8-bit mono WAV) &amp; then through a DMC converter (had to use DOSemu to get it working under linux; Wine just didn't cut it).  For the few seconds it was, it sounded pretty decent.  Once I get back in school later next month, I'm planning on writing a very quick demo to play through the whole thing (or at least a cut loop), on an MMC3 mapper probably...

<br />
<br />I wrote a PCM player too, but cheating in a major way.  I used a PIC microcontroller to get 4 channels (with independent freq/volume) of output at 22050Hz.  NES just gets a sample IRQ and plays it, like a PC can do with a soundblaster.

<br />Please stop with the personal attacks against me, and bogus quoting.
<br />
<br />You wanted to store several minutes of music on a 256K ROM from what I recall.  *THAT* is what I said was impossible to do.    Obviously it's not impossible to play PCM.  It's simply impossible to store say, 2-3 minutes of PCM at 22KHz and hope to fit it into 256Kbytes, which is what you wanted to do.  3 minutes ends up being around 4Mbytes.   You'd need 16x compression to achieve that.  While possible on a PC, decoding that in real time on an NES is not possible without some kind of DSP on a cart.
<br />
<br />atari2600:   I didn't say it was impossible,  I said that it's useless to try to store alot of music (i.e. a complete song is what you wanted to store, as I recall).  The amount of ROM space would be huge.  And as I recall saying, sure you can do it if you want 2Mbytes of ROM just for the audio.   i.e. it IS possible, but not practical.

<br />But given the amount of repetition in a lot of modern popular songs, it just might be possible using the <a href="http://www.oldskool.org/sound/pc" class="postlink">Space Racer technique</a>. I counted only about 30 unique measures in the first two verses of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Gonna_Give_You_Up" class="postlink">Never Gonna Give You Up</a>" by Rick Astley, known on the internets as the song from the "Rick Roll" fad. At that song's tempo (roughly 112.5 BPM), 30 measures equal 64 seconds of <em>unique</em> audio.
