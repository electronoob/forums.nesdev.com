		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Interesting... but there are a few problems.
<br />
<br />1)  There's more to emulating than just the CPU, and those areas require more CPU time.  You could still make this work if this is just one thread and you do everything else in seperate threads, but you'd still have to sync them somehow.
<br />
<br />2)  It's opcode accurate and not cycle accurate.  So if this method is used to sync with other subsystems of the NES (like the PPU) it wouldn't be as accurate as some alternatives.  Unless you spin in a loop like this <em>per cycle</em> which I guess would work.
<br />
<br />3)  It's criminally inefficient.  You're effectively making the computer spin in a clock checking loop which will burn 100% CPU time.
<br />
<br />4)  Makes fastforward impossible.  Also might have problems with frameskip or if the emu can't run fullspeed.

The only possible practical value it could have would be to handle joypad updates smoother, but since all games (except for one that I know of) poll joypad data once per frame, it's a moot point.
<br />
<br />Nobody will notice if you do all the work for a frame as quickly as the computer is capable.  What the user notices is the frames themselves.  Therefore the generally accepted approach is to do things on a frame-by-frame basis.  Rather than space out individual cycles or instructions, you just space out the frames as evenly as you can.
<br />
<br />I tend to recommend the tried-and-true timestamp and catch-up approach.  Keep a CPU timestamp which you update between instructions (or cycles), and keep timestamps for other systems (PPU, APU, mapper IRQ counters, etc) and use the timestamps to keep them synced up.  Generally you run the CPU ahead of everything else, then when the CPU needs to interact with the PPU, you would "catch up" the PPU by running it until its timestamp reaches the CPU's timestamp.
<br />
<br />You'd just run the CPU until it's timestamp reaches the end of the frame, then catch up the PPU/APU/etc, output your frame of video and audio, <em>then</em> do the timing stuff and wait another 1/60th of a second before doing the next frame.
<br />
<br />A properly designed timestamp and catchup system can be just as accurate as any other approach, and is far more efficient than some other approaches (though it may not be the most efficient -- these days the most efficient method would probably involve multiple threads).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Timing accuracy in an emulator is measured relatively, where one chip should execute <em>x</em> cycles for every <em>y</em> cycles of another chip. For example, the NTSC NES's PPU executes 3 cycles for each cycle of the CPU and APU. Emulators often handle this with a timestamping scheme: the CPU runs "ahead" of the other units, and any writes to PPU or APU registers are logged with a cycle count. When the CPU does anything that depends on the precise state of the PPU and APU, the emulator runs the PPU and APU to "catch up" to the number of cycles that the CPU has run. These include reading PPUSTATUS ($2002) while in range of sprite 0, or executing just before other units are expected to issue an interrupt.
<br />
<br />Accuracy does not depend on how many cycles of the emulated machine are executed for each cycle of the host CPU, except at one point: just before the first cycle of the "dummy" or "post-render" scanline (#240). That's when your emulator should catch up all units and then wait for DirectX (or another platform's counterpart) to make sure it's clear to send the finished pixels and samples for the frame that it just rendered.

<br />
<br />As for multiple threads, PCs have been fast enough for the past eight years that one core can handle a single NES. If you want to make your emulator thread-safe, it might be for handling multiple consoles at once, such as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1vEDKr6F5Y" class="postlink">nemulator's Wii-reminiscent picker</a>.

<br />
<br />Ok that sounds very efficient to me, I will start experimenting with that.
<br />
<br />I would definitely like to work with threads but I want to keep my code portable (language is C) and id especially like it to work in mobile devices as well in a couple years maybe, who knows. Thanks, I'll let you know how it turns out in the coming weeks/months.

<br />I read your post on

<br />
<br />and I had a question regarding your "master cycles" concept.
<br />
<br />I noticed you used 5 for ppu and 15 for cpu. This make sense since the ppu is 3 times the speed of the cpu. What would be the benefit of using 5 and 15 instead of say 1 and 3. Wouldn't 1 and 3 be just as efficient? Or even 10 and 30 to make things even.
<br />
<br />I was just curious why you used 5 and 15 over the other numbers for representing ppu and cpu.
<br />
<br />Thanks in advance

<br />
<br />The NTSC ratio is 3:1.  The PAL ratio is 3.2:1 (CPU is a little slower).  To represent this in integers, rather than dealing with potentially lossy floating points, I use the following constants:
<br />
<br />PPU (NTSC and PAL) = 5
<br />CPU (NTSC) = 15
<br />CPU (PAL) = 16
<br />
<br />This provides the proper PPU:CPU cycle ratio for both NTSC and PAL emulation.

<br />But yeah... I didn't mean to imply that floating points are unreliable -- I'm just saying that for something like this where exact precision is everything, integers just seem like the better option.  Exact precision isn't something you can always get with floating points.

<br />
<br />Though even in interleaved, the framerate would still sort of be 60 Hz -- it's just that you only output half the frame each time instead of the full frame each time.  Interleaved is like a tradeoff -- half the framerate for twice the vertical resolution.

<br />
<br />Interlaced is the correct term here.  Reference material:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlace" class="postlink">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlace</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.labdv.com/leon-lab/video/interlace_en.htm" class="postlink">http://www.labdv.com/leon-lab/video/interlace_en.htm</a>
<br />
<br />Most consoles (including many today!) use interlaced output (odd first, even second, I think -- or do I have the order reversed?).  The assumption made is that the connected device is a TV, or otherwise will do deinterlacing itself.
<br />
<br />Visual example of what I'm referring to:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://videoanimal.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/de-interlaced.png" class="postlink">http://videoanimal.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/de-interlaced.png</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.elurauser.com/articles/deinterlace_weave_lq.jpg" class="postlink">http://www.elurauser.com/articles/deinterlace_weave_lq.jpg</a>
<br />
<br />It's pretty sad how much video there is on the Internet which is intended for computer monitor use, yet remains interlaced.  Most users don't seem to understand that the results look horrible.  :-(
