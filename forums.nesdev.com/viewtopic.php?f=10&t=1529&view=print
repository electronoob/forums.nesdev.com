		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is it possible to set up sine and cosine Look up tables in 6502.  Ive some demos that incorperate sine tables(in think the Copper demo by Quietust).  Ive seen demos that use sprites moving in sinewave fashion on the screen.  BUt i heard that the NES doesnt jive in Decimal mode.  How would you implement  cos 43* (.731353702)?
<br />What about 3d tranforms ive seen some demos that utilizes these, specfically the ELITE game on the main page.  I was wondering cuase it could be possible to rotate a 3d Triangle with a sine wave.  But this all just theory in my head. Anyone know of any sinewave algorithms?

<br />
<br />I use trig tables in a raycaster I'm making for the NES. I think I use 10 bits for the fractional part, but I'm not sure right now.
<br />
<br />The problem with 3D transforms on the NES is not handling fractional numbers, but the ammount of multiplications and divisions involved.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Fixed point routines are how PC, calculators and stuff handle this. I think there is a simpler way that is approximate. Use Binary radians (brad) to show the angles. For example, an angle of 360° would be 256 brad, 90° is 64 brad, etc... So you can get a circle on a 8-bit variable for an angle.
<br />To convert from degree to brad, just divide by 360 and multiply by 256, and to convert from radians to brad, divide by 2*3.141592658979 and multiply by 256.
<br />Results of sine and cosine are always between 0 and 1, and you'll never use them as it, but multiply by other values to get usable numbers. Of course, in binary, results between 0 and 1 are impossible, but you can scale this to 0 and 255, and do all calculation by tables, wich you get a decent speed. Programming floating point routines on the NES would be about half a minute to calculate a sine and eat lot of useless RAM and ROM.
<br />Of couse, sine and cosine results scaled between 0 and 255 would be approximate, but due to the low resolution for NES graphics, that will be perfectly well.
<br />To do this table :
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">SinTbl:<br />define angle=0<br />.rept 256<br />&nbsp;.db &#40;sin&#40;angle&#41;*127&#41;+128<br />.rdef angle = angle+1<br />.endrept<br /><br />CosTbl:<br />.rdef angle=0<br />.db &#40;cos&#40;angle&#41;*127&#41;+128<br />.rdef angle = angle+1<br />.endrept</div><br />You'll note that a value of $80 for sine/cosine means zero, $00 means -1 and $ff means +1. You could change the formula to get another sheme if you like (for example you may prefer keep zero to $00, and using signed numbers).[/code]

<br />Fixed point is quite simple. This name comes from the fact that there is a point, separating the integer part and the fractional part of a number (for example, 67.25). Since the point is fixed, the same number of bits is always used to represent each part.
<br />
<br />If you want the numbers to fit in 8 bits, you have to sacrifice some of it's range for use in the fractional part. You could use a 4.4 format. 4 bits for each part. This would allow you to count from 0.0 to 15.9375, in 0.0625 increments.
<br />
<br />You know how the value of the first bit is 1? And the value of the second bit is 2, the value of the third is 4, etc? That's 2^0 = 1, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, etc. The same is true when you go backwards (towards the fractional part): 2^-1 = 0.5, 2^-2 = 0.25, 2^-3 = 0.125, 2^-4 = 0.0625. You don't <strong>really</strong> need to know that, but it is better if you do.
<br />
<br />Now, multiplication and addition with such numbers work normally. If you do 5.5 + 2.5 (01011000 + 00101000) = 8 (10000000), in our 4.4 format. To round it you simply dischard the bottom 4 bits (fractional part), resulting in a normal binary 8 (1000).
<br />
<br />Multiplication and division will not work directly. Multiplying 2 4.4 numbers will give you a 8.8 result, so you have to divide that by 16 to get rid of the extra fractional part and go back to the format with only 4 bits in the fractional part. Division is the opposite, you'll get a number smaller than you wanted. So you should pad the dividend with 4 extra bits before dividing, to get a correct result within the format you're working with.
<br />
<br />If it sounds complicated (I suck at explaining), look for some fixed point tutorials on the web, I'm sure there are plenty of them. Unfotunately I have none to recomend.
