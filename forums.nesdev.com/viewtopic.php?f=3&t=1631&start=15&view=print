This just seem logical. Some people invokes the argument that emulation could rather lead people to buy more games, but Nintendo looks to disagree. Overall, I found those conclusions. Emulation :
<br />- Promote the sales of sequels of earlier games (if you downloaded and liked a game, chances are that you're interested in buying a sequel to if for a more recent game machine)
<br />- Doesn't influent much sales of new games
<br />- Break down sales of remakes (why buy a remake if you can download the original, wich is often better ?)

<br />
<br />The law doesn't have to be logical, mostly because it's largely historical and updates are kept as minimal as possible. Copyright was originally meant to expand the valuable public domain of intellectual creations by providing further economic benefits to creators, but it's been warped into a means of indefinite profit for the creator. Games which have been dormant can be brought back at any time, for example the ports to Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance, and soon the Wii. The particular format of the games isn't in production anymore (NES cartridges), but the copyrighted work (the code and game characters) is still being maintained.
<br />
<br />I'm always trying to learn more about copyright law, so don't hesitate in correcting me.

<br />I mean... Say there is a fully functional <em>Nintendo Wii</em> emulator for PC's (yeah, right). Nintendo wouldn't want you to buy only the games (even if you did) and play them in your PC. They'd want you to buy the console too. No?
<br />
<br />Also, if emulators are legal for use with PD ROMs and such... are famiclones legal too?
<br />
<br />I don't know... it sounds really weird to me that it is OK to use their architecture (in the form of emulators or clones) as long as you don't use illegal copies of their software.

<br />In some countries, emulators are legal even if hardware clones are not because an algorithm running on generic computer hardware is not patentable.

<br />
<br />Is that still the case? As far as I know, UNISYS' GIF patent was applicable not only in the US but also in European countries. But of course, Nintendo likely hasn't patented any of its algorithms used in their consoles. And they expire. Thank god Disney doesn't make consumer electronics.
<br />
<br />Anyway, since Bleem! won continuously in court, <em>and</em> their work was for sale, I'd say there's strong precedent for even modern emulators to be legal. However, you'd better have more money than the company suing you if you expect to avoid bankruptcy.
<br />I'm surprised more companies don't take advantage of this. Why not have say, Sunny Delight sue Tropicana until they bankrupt? Sue them for made up stuff just to waste time and money until they fold. Hey, it worked great for Sony.
<br />
<br />On a related note, we could bypass the legality of ROMs (at least until they all fail from old age) by creating a USB "cart connector" that you attach real NES cartridges to. And then you'd be able to control the accesses to the cart through the emulator. Is there any reason this approach won't work? I imagine it would also be very helpful for reverse engineering weird special cart hardware.

<br />
<br />You seem to have fallen for the fantasies of many copyright/patent holders. These are state-granted monopolies originally created for the purpose of having <em>more</em> things that the public can do <em>whatever they damn well please</em> with, in the long-term. Neither grant any property rights, just monopoly on some <em>uses</em> of the ideas/implementations. The use of the term "property" in connection with these monopolies is an attempt to mislead people like us into mistakenly applying the concepts of property. They don't apply, since unlike property, copyrighted materials and patentable ideas can't be stolen, only shared and used.

<br />Redesigning a dumper such as CopyNES or IO-56 or the like for USB comms would make this work. Emulators that support such dumpers would make a copy in volatile RAM (more likely to be fair use), apply IPS or XOR patches to it, and then start running it. But how would a homebrew author prove that a given ROM, made from scratch, is in fact homebrew?

<br />Ignoring the obvious reply pointing to its quality, this question can be posed without reference to emulation at all: how would a homebrew author prove that the cartridge he created and sells isn't just an illegally copied commercial game, perhaps modified to look different?

<br />That would be decided in a court of law, using legal tests that are well known among Silicon Valley copyright lawyers. My question referred to a hypothetical emulator that could be used with homebrew but not with commercial games.

The "pirate" originals and some licensed also fall into this category. I should haven't mentioned it at all, since I can now think of several homebrew games I've tried which are of decent quality (your Tetramino and several of the 4K competition games come to mind). I shouldn't badmouth unless I'm specific about it anyway, otherwise I involve unintended targets, so ignore all my blather here. :)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">My question referred to a hypothetical emulator that could be used with homebrew but not with commercial games.</div>
<br />
<br />I see. Perhaps a DRM scheme (oh noes!) where the developer uses a special assembler that digitally signs the result. This would limit play to only those things with source code, though some filter would be necessary to prevent bypass by converting commercial games into a bunch of .byte directives or mass-disassembly and then feeding that to the assembler.

You cannot steal from someone else because it is annoying to him, and after all it is also bad for your own honnor (well, it all depend who you are). You cannot piracy software because it would harm the entreprise that legitimaly produce it and make it run down its buisness, inolving people loose their work, and it would have bad effects on the industry.
<br />Law has not been created to be annoying, it has been created to help one to live with eachother with the least conflicts as possible. At least thats what I honnestly believe.
<br />Then, the law also have to adapt itself to technology. Unfortunetely, theese days the technology go too fast and the law sometimes cannot follow it.
<br />Come on, download NES games doesn't hurt the buisness level of Nintendo. They have enough money to run at least for now, and even if they wouldn't, not downloading NES game but buy used games instead won't change the finnancial situation of Nintendo at all, since they aren't producting it any longer.
<br />Now, effectivly, this may cause the downs of sales for remakes, wich still have the same levels, characters, ect... that in copirighted NES games. But remake aren't innovative and weakens the game industry. For some reason, Nintendo seems silly and release tons of remake and innovate nothing. No wonder why they complain : It's not to an entreprise to submit their custommer and decide wich games they like and they will buy. It's to the entreprise to do their best for their custommers. So if Nintendo wants release remakes people are not interested of because they downloaded the original, and Nintendo claims it is illegal to do so because the remake don't sell, its their fault. Make innovation, sequels not remakes.
<br />By the way, I can like remakes, if they are well done. I bought the GBC version of Dragon Warrior III, wich is much better than the NES one I have on my PC. But this is pretty rare.
<br />I also think I'd never buy Fire Emblem GBA, Megaman Battle Network GBA, Dragon Warrior III GBC, Sword of Mana GBA, Dragon Quest on PS2, Breath of Fire on PS2, and maybe no GBA console at all if I didn't downloaded prequels to the above games for NES and SNES for free, making me like the games and buy their more recent sequels.

<br />Maybe those enterprises are founded on an untenable idea mistakenly upheld through a wasteful law:
<br />
<br /><em>There has grown up in the minds of certain groups in this country the notion that because a man or a corporation has made a profit out of the public for a number of years, the government and the courts are charged with the duty of guaranteeing such profit in the future, even in the face of changing circumstances and contrary public interest. This strange doctrine is not supported by statute nor common law. Neither individuals nor corporations have any right to come into court and ask that the clock of history be stopped, or turned back, for their private benefit.</em> - Robert A. Heinlein
