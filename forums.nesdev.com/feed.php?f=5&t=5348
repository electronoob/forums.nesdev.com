Thank you Memblers.<br /><br />Of course the idiots who make all the fuss by blowing themselves up do get all of the attention, but my main concern is that they voted Hamas as their government, and we all know what they think of the Jews/Israel. So why should they be given a state of their own?<br /><br />I'm not saying that all Muslims wants the Jews dead, but the governments of the surrounding countries certainly do. How many times have they attacked Israel only to be defeated. If I were the Israelis, I wouldn't give those particular Muslims a minute of my time, let alone half my country.<br /><br />Obviously I call for peace/end of discrimination on both sides, but when it comes down to a religious war, there never will be an end.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=191">WedNESday</a> — Sun Jun 28, 2009 2:19 pm</p><hr />

Last time there was a discussion about rules it went full circle, and came back to me declaring there are no rules, other than Parodius' policies and the general concept of "don't be a dick".<br /><br />Yep this is the general forum, seems like some of the sentiment expressed may be that we could use an "NES General" section.  Sometimes this section is kind of random, sometimes it's mostly game related.<br /><br /><br />The Israeli/Palestinian conflict is probably something a lot of people don't think about.  Out of sight, out of mind.  I think there are small groups of idiots on both sides that get all the attention, and by far the vast majority of normal and sensible people are living in the middle of it, quietly.<br /><br />I think this kind of disconnect between people can be started by some kind of screwed-up doctrine, and fueled by racism and ignorance.  Look at the history of north america, people (including my ancestors) have lived here basically forever, but they were turned into refugees in their own homes.  Treaties were signed and broken immediately.  It was a lot of bullshit.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Jun 28, 2009 12:21 pm</p><hr />

Well my opinion is that I'm 100% neutral and that people should stop to conflict because of misinterpreated religious ideals, especially if the religious ideal in question tell people to not conflict with others. Does this answer to your question wed-nes-day ? Why are you asking that in the first place ? Because of recent trouble in Iran ?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Jun 28, 2009 7:05 am</p><hr />

I've asked a <em>sensitive</em> but also <em>serious</em> question in the 'General Stuff' forums and you guys have had to make this into another one of those 'WedNESday is an arsehole/idiot/flamer/joker' again.<br /><br />Yes I do like to goof around sometimes for fun, and yes my last 10 or so posts have been for fun, but the 440 odd before that weren't (save a few). The reason I haven't made any NES related questions for a while is that I haven't had the time to program much recently.<br /><br />Yes I could ask this question in another forum, but I know you guys better than I know anyone else (forum wise), so I would appreciate your comments more than somebody else's.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=191">WedNESday</a> — Sun Jun 28, 2009 5:21 am</p><hr />
