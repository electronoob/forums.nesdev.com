<br />A glitched part of the tile map is not a valid part of the level map, it's just a buffer of sorts. That is different from what I said. But enough of this.

<br />
<br />It sucks that I can't freely use animation without relying on several different methods/tricks to get the best use of animation out of the Snes.  Yes it is possible to pull off 60 fps animation, but you need to design levels in certain ways so that one enemy's animation doesn't interfere with another enemy.

<br />Eh, you could say the opposite is just as silly.  If there's actually data there and the player can normally see it, but you block it just because a few sprites won't look absolutely perfect...just seems kind of petty.  Even worse that the cover up uses a lot of resources.

<br />I absolutely hate scrolling glitches, so I'll do whatever I can to prevent them. Sprites popping at the left side of the screen don't bother me that much... it bothers me much less than hiding a perfectly good column of the level map, so I don't do that.

<br />I think some of you are not respecting other peoples' opinions when you state as fact that a certain thing is stupid or silly, just because they differ from your own.

<br />Scrolling smoothly from the top is possible without an extra mapper too. You could do something battletoads-ish (use forced VBlank for the first 9 or 17 lines, but this complicates scrolling) or use a blank CHR-bank. MMC5's "fill mode" combined by a 8-sprite per line limitation abuse could do it with almost no sacrifices (just 8 sprites and an IRQ).
<br />
<br />What could be possible (and cool) tough would be a mapper that could automatically disable it's CHR-ROM/RAM for the first 8/16 lines without the need of any IRQ, etc...

<br />If this was renamed "31 column screen mode" would you still hate it ? It's not a perfectly good column because sprites popus up....
<br />
<br />I mean there is several good arguments against this (heh I don't use left-clipping in my game) but I just feels like yours are biased.

This replacement would allow negative coordinates (this could work for the top of the screen as well, I guess) and would generate regular OAM data to feed to the NES, and would watch the rendering of the image very closely (kinda like the MMC5 does) and supply the PPU with modified patterns for the sprites that use negative coordinates.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">You could do something battletoads-ish (use forced VBlank for the first 9 or 17 lines, but this complicates scrolling) or use a blank CHR-bank.</div><br />Why 9 or 17? 8 and 16 should work just fine. The fact that sprites can't start on scanline 0 doesn't matter, because if they could they would be completely masked off anyway. I'm blanking 16 scanlines at the top of the screen and it's working great (making the NMI constant-timed was a bit tough at first, but with that out of the way I'm 100% happy).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">MMC5's "fill mode" combined by a 8-sprite per line limitation abuse could do it with almost no sacrifices (just 8 sprites and an IRQ).</div><br />If you use 8 high priority transparent sprites to hide the others <strong>then</strong> you will only be able to see sprites after 17 scanlines.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What could be possible (and cool) tough would be a mapper that could automatically disable it's CHR-ROM/RAM for the first 8/16 lines without the need of any IRQ, etc...</div><br />True.

<br />Of course they are biased, it's my game. I'm just expressing my thoughts, and everyone is free to disagree with them, but in a respectful manner rather than just stating that they are silly/stupid.

<br /> Yeah, maybe it's the language barrier or something. But I don't see how someone can take my comment seriously when I used the word "silly". Using the word "silly"... is just silly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you really wanted to minimize visual scrolling glitches, I'd recommend to go with vertical mirroring (like Milon's Secret Castle).
<br />
<br />Maybe it's because my locale uses NTSC, but the topmost and bottommost scanlines are *always* off screen (as much as 8px on each edge, too!), whereas the leftmost and rightmost column of tiles is usually visible. Therefore, I could conclude that it'd be situationally easier to mask vertical glitches than horizontal.
<br />
<br />Also, setting the scrolling mid-frame (i.e., after a forced vblank) isn't tricky at all, you just write $2006, $2005, $2005, $2006. You'll need to offset the Y scrolling to compensate, but that's a very trivial matter, and even though that last write to $2006 requires a little bit of bit shifting to calculate, that can all be calculated before the screen split.

<br />I already solved all my scrolling issues. I use vertical mirroring and manually blank the top 16 scanlines of the image.
