Simply have one copy of the sound driver in the ROM, then have copies of a series of three pointers (six bytes total) corresponding to your music that will be loaded at $208 in SPC700 RAM. When you switch banks, you'll only have six bytes plus the filesize of whatever music you're using to load. The code to load data is defined in a way that makes this real easy.</div><br />Very cool, this definitely sounds like it's worth a try, as does your idea with leaving samples in audio RAM, even if only to speed up song loading. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />BTW KungFuFurby, do you happen to know how to add <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panning_%28audio%29" class="postlink">panning</a> information in SNESGSS? As it seems, the software ignores panning data in MIDI files for whatever reason. And I couldn't figure out how to do it when editing the song.<br /><br />About the song crashing issue, I've been aware that all emulators (including higan-accuracy) tend to freeze after repeatedly loading any of the three songs, but I never encountered any issues on real hardware so far. Will have to look into the matter some more. As SNESGSS is very poorly documented, I had a hard time figuring out how to proceed when loading a (new) song at all. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /> <br /><br />Here's how I'm currently doing it – not sure if this is 100% correct (with an initialization of the SPC700 done earlier, of course):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LoadMusic02:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jsl music_stop<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A16<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda.w #SCMD_LOAD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta gss_command<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;stz gss_param<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jsl spc_command_asm<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A16<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #:spc700_code_02<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta DP_SPC_DATA_BANK<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #spc700_code_02+2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta DP_SPC_DATA_OFFS<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda.l spc700_code_02<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta DP_SPC_DATA_SIZE<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$0200<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta DP_SPC_DATA_ADDR<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jsl spc_load_data<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A16<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda.w #SCMD_INITIALIZE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta gss_command<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;stz gss_param<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jsl spc_command_asm<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A16<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda.w #SCMD_LOAD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta gss_command<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;stz gss_param<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jsl spc_command_asm<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A16<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #:music_02_data<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta DP_SPC_DATA_BANK<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #music_02_data+2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta DP_SPC_DATA_OFFS<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda.l music_02_data<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta DP_SPC_DATA_SIZE<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda.l spc700_code_02+14<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta DP_SPC_DATA_ADDR<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jsl spc_load_data<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A16<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$00FF<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta DP_SPC_VOL_FADESPD<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$007F<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta DP_SPC_VOL_CURRENT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jsl spc_global_volume<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A16<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda.w #SCMD_MUSIC_PLAY<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta gss_command<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;stz gss_param<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jsl spc_command_asm<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A8<br />rts<br /></div><br /></div><br /><br />I looked up the code for the sound driver.

I've been thinking about making my own SNES tools but I'm not much of a programmer (they'd be made in Processing, which is built on top of Java at this point, and then I'd probably port them to other platforms). <br /><br />I've been trying to use Schism Tracker as well and then converting with snesmodlite, but the results are a little unpredictable (ie how samples get converted), not horrible, but unpredictable. I feel like Schism Tracker is a bit better suited for production (does SNESGSS actually have the ability to edit multiple patterns?)<br /><br />I'm hoping elix put out their tracker maybe at some point: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-VfFzOQRDk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-VfFzOQRDk</a><!-- m --><br /><br />or bazz does more work on his<br /><br /><br />That being said I quite like the demos, my only advice is that the walking furry character seems a bit asymetrical (ie like he is limping).
