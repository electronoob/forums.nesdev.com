<br />
<br /> Many things in art can be created in randomness. It's up to the artist to choose it, use it, massage it, tweak it, etc. I guess it's viewed a little differently since the code has to reproduce the 'effect' everytime (and emulators don't get it right, per se. Given the benefit of doubt, I'd say the demo maker specifically relied on the real hardware since that's what I would assume would be used in the compo). The fact that it's 'unstable' is irrelevant.

<br />It could throw some fake stray writes on the screen, then suddenly they would persist instead of going away, and form patterns or designs.  That could have been cool, this just looks like bad noob code.
<br />
<br />Edit: The worst thing about this demo is that it can't keep a steady music tempo, and just sounds terrible.

<br />Sorry but I can't let you get away with this.
<br />This is a glitchy and crappy program and you call it art. Are you serious ? And you mean this is intentional ? You are the retarded one.
<br />There is nothing cool or impressive about this. Action 52 is impressive because they dared to sell it, but here it's not even this.

<br />
<br />Second, I'll say this is impressive to me. Not from an NES / 6502 coding standpoint, but from a creative standpoint. It is sort of like authoring a Milkdrop visualization. You just keep adding random stuff until you get something interesting out of the randomization. That said I think you can accomplish the same thing by using a random ROM corrupter on the SMB1 ROM. There's no real coding skill <em>displayed</em> here other than the first few lessons of the Nerdy Nights tutorials.
<br />
<br />Now, with all of that said, I agree with Koitsu. You'd have to be stoned to think this was cool. Believe me, <em>I know</em>.

<br /> Hello. Your reading compression level is apparently not currently at an adequate enough level to generate a proper reply <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> As Shiru pointed out, see the quotes around the word art. I'm not using it as my word, but in general/broad context. And I knew exactly what the demo was about and <em>I'm</em> the retarded one? Go figure. Also, I never said it was impressive or cool. If <em>that</em> part didn't apply to me, you should've put that in a separate paragraph or added some lines of space to differentiate it to the reply of my post. Thanks for trying, though <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> 
<br />
<br />
<br /> As for demos, I think <em>most</em> demos (not in the context of a "game" demo) do fall under what most consider 'art'. They're more than just a boring representation of some effects (not that some aren't). The music/sounds, the theme, colors, style, etc. The whole presentation. Whether it appeals to someone's tastes or not, is irrelevant. You can draw a personal line as to what you think is art, but that is just personal preference of skill in presentation (being it painting or drawing or whatever). Or rather, the artists skills. Poor or lacking skills doesn't mean a work of expression <em>isn'</em>t art. It just means that it's probably below your standards of enjoyment/reception/Ican'tthinkoftherightfuckingword,meh.   
<br />
<br />
<br />  What's the whole point in finding out what the code does? Or whether it's up to snuff or not? I mean, unless you're still hooked on the whole "I'm not so sure the glitches are really intentional". The probability that the code did glitch due to bad coding *and* the programmer played it off on the spot like it was support to be that way, is pretty damn low IMO. Especially since this is a known genre/area of demo making (I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't originally inspired by the "bending" scene. The style, I mean. Then again, I remember making such demos as a kid in BASIC, in the 80's. I wasn't the only one either). There's a much higher probability that he/she/they either accidentally glitched it at some point and decided to stick with that, or they purposely glitched it in specific ways until they were happy with the end result. Both come to the same result; the persons or group entered it into the compo knowing full well what the output and presentation should look like.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />koitsu:  Heheh, a while back I had already passed the point where I could look back on the stuff I did a long time ago and realize how crappy most of it was, my friend Andrew and I were talking about that too, we worked on a lot of tracked music and game designs together, including such NES masterpieces as Retard Adventure, Urban Acid Zombies, and Hot Seat Harry.  A lot of the music if it had an interesting part, was usually surrounded by all sorts of weird stuff - and lots of parts left in because it sounded funny.  But I made a genre called "industrial trash music", so things were mostly coming out as expected. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I've seen other demos visy has worked on (some great ones), so I realized (well, after trying to select NTSC/PAL) that it had to be glitchy intentionally.  I thought it was cool, I didn't like the jumping screen feature much, it'd be a challenge to get more annoying than that.
<br />
<br />For making a glitchy demo I think the NES can do some interesting stuff.  I'm still waiting to see someone do all their graphics entirely by enabling/disabling the monochrome bit, heheh.  AFAIK Final Fantasy (when getting an orb) is the only program that did something like that (essentially making an extra transparent layer of graphics).  But it would be nearly impossible to do that in a clean-looking way.

<br />That's an interesting way of putting it. I had to stop and ponder that for awhile. I guess it is.
<br />
<br />I suppose it's a little like how a compiler can parse high level code and make it into machine code.
<br />
<br />Maybe many people look at some sort of artistic expression and see it as a waste. It's not perfectly compliant code.
<br />
<br />What do people aim for when they express? Do they express something that can easily be comprehended by a wide audience? Do they express something more perfectly synthesized, but difficult for almost anybody to ever comprehend? Do they make something that is easily comprehended by a fringe audience, but challenging for most?
<br />
