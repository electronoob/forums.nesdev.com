<br />This NES game maker is fake. Someone needs to go and make it real. And I expect to work on a side-scroller maker after I 1. finish the Missile Command clone that Jeroen put me up to, 2. figure out how to efficiently test collision of a game object against a sloped surface, and 3. play through the copy of WarioWare DIY that I bought today to see how to make a game maker's UI.

<br />Klik &amp; Play had a better UI, since you did not need to drag in order to place objects.  After selecting the object you want to place, Left click to place one object, right click to place more than one object.  Perfect.
<br />It was also lacking a tilemap editor for tile-based games.  Seemed to be more oriented towards classic home computer single screen platformers than NES/SNES style games.

<br />
<br />Personally, I think a combination of RPG Maker (tile-based map editing), and KnP/TGF/MMF (overall handling of... everything else?) would make a pretty decent UI for an overall console-style game maker.
<br />
<br />The thing that bothers me, however, is the fact that many of these "Game Construction Kit" programs lack a good way to compose music, and this is actually something I've been trying to put a little research into. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />Edit: The way I solved the lack of tilemap is by turning on the grid, and forcing everything to snap to it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />What's the objective difference between being crazy and being crazy with a mental disorder? This is a serious question. I ask because it sounds like the distinction between the letter C and an ink mark in the same shape; does the letter C posses something that the ink mark in the same shape doesn't?

<br />The letter C can be represented in a way that is accessible to multiple ways of using text, such as text to speech, braille, or searching. A group of pixels representing the shape of this letter can't, at least without OCR. In addition, the letter C is easy to distinguish from c or [ or ( or С (Cyrillic for the letter S) or Ⲥ (Coptic for the letter S) or ⵛ (Tifinagh for the letter Sh) or ᑕ (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Aboriginal_syllabics" class="postlink">Canadagana</a> for the syllable DA) or Ꮯ (Cherokee for the syllable TLI) or ር (Ethiopic for the syllable RE) or ල (Sinhala for the syllable LA) or Ⅽ (Roman numeral for 100).
