I have finished scalers 100% and that is done, so I started on the scanline generators.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.kevtris.org/blogfiles/hdmi/scanlines/latest/">http://blog.kevtris.org/blogfiles/hdmi/ ... es/latest/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I ran into a problem which I knew I'd have on 1080p (and PAL modes).  That is, each NES scanline requires a non-integer number of scanlines on the HDMI display.  Namely at 1080p, each NES scanline needs 4.5 HDMI scanlines.  <br /><br />This means that the height of each subsequent NES scanline alternates 4/5/4/5/4/5 HDMI lines. <br /><br />To counter this (you can see an example of what this type looks like, see below) I came up with a scan line generator that &quot;free runs&quot; in relation to the NES video, instead of trying to &quot;scanline&quot; each NES line on the HDMI display.  The results of this method are in the above /latest/ directory.<br /><br />There's also a scanline generator that is tied to the actual NES scanlines, but it can look bad (especially on PAL) due to the afore-mentioned problem.  Those are here:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.kevtris.org/blogfiles/hdmi/scanlines/">http://blog.kevtris.org/blogfiles/hdmi/scanlines/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />the filename describes how &quot;Deep&quot; the scanline effect is.  0 = no scanlines at all, FF = maximum.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Considering the high resolution of the upscaled image, having black lines the size of the upscaled line would probably look bad compared to thinner lines that don't fall exactly between NES scanlines. Plus wouldn't it simulate an older display better that way as the lines you'd see in a CRT aren't going to match up with every NES line of pixels. <br /><br />Either way, I think kevtris made it clear it'll be full of options for everyone's tastes.

Scanlines look fine at 720p. But the NES's 240p picture height doesn't divide evenly into 1080p. Our attempts to make a 4.5-pixel-tall scanline pattern have looked like Venetian blinds, where the 2-line repeating pattern sticks out like a sore thumb. Kev would love to be proven wrong about this.<br /><br />PAL is even hairier to scale. The PAL NES and Dendy PPUs generate a 288p picture with 240 lines of background and sprites plus 48 pixels of combined top and bottom border. Each NES line corresponds to 2.5 720p lines, 3.75 1080p lines, or 4.167 1200p lines.

I'm not going to go into how CRTs look. We all know how it looks on a CRT. This is just about putting filters on to make it more your taste. I didn't spend a lot of time studying the pictures shown. <br /><br />The lines that don't exactly match up that I may have been thinking of may have been the aperture grille or shadow mask.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A lot of people have misconceptions about scanlines and why they are there - they are just gaps between the areas the beam normally strikes that would normally be hit on every other field. To have scanlines superimposed on a generated image is pointless if the spacing of the scanlines does not equal the spacing of the output image's pixels vertically. How wide they should be, how soft / strong, etc. is a matter of taste, but if they don't match the number of lines then you might as well superimpose any horizontal lines and call it a day. <br /><br />It's not that the lines should be the same size, it's the spacing and number of lines that matters. To fit it properly into 1080 lines, an integer scaling of 5 might not be inappropriate. At first this seems too strong, as 240 * 5 == 1200 which is too tall for 1080. However, most standard NTSC TVs only saw ~224 of these lines, and many backdrop mappings and HUD placements are made for an even safer zoning. Chopping off a few lines on the top and bottom wouldn't be so bad. If you take 224 and scale it by 5, the resulting height is 1120, which almost fits into 1080. Definitely not the ideal solution, but it would allow clean scaling at the expensive of one row of tiles (when compared to a 224-height image). Perhaps something like that could be an option.<br /><br />EDIT: I'm a bumbling moron when I explain stuff, here are some images I made.<br /><br />This image is a rough approximation of a scanline filter I whipped together over Super Mario Bros. The important detail is that the dark regions, simulating the gaps between the CRT beam trails, is on the transition point between the pixels. The intended appearance is that the line, the lighter part, looks more like a slightly fuzzy beam going from one side to the other. The dark areas separate the rows.<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lK7h5mG.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />This second image is the same source image, but the scanlines being overlaid are spaced a little further off of the pixel spacing, giving an interesing moire pattern. The scanlines no longer emphasize the vertical spacing of the pixels, and it just looks like a goof put window blinds over the image. This is what a lot of people do with the Gonbes RGB adapter paired with a scanline generator PCB:<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZTUGhHS.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />In my opinion the first looks a lot more like what a CRT is doing. I hope that clears up what I'm trying to say.
