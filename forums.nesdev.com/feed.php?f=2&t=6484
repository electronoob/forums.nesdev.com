So this is basically the NES equivalent to the C64's stable raster IRQ, except with no IRQ? Brilliant. Now if I could just figure out something similar for the Megadrive, could do some fun things by changing values in VDP registers (that don't require writing to VDP RAM).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=325">LocalH</a> — Sun Jun 20, 2010 4:50 pm</p><hr />

OK, you've convinced me to carry this all the way through. PAL shouldn't be nearly as difficult because of the way VBL is synchronized with CPU cycles more firmly. Basically the only thing there to deal with is the variable NMI latency. The current technique will carry over easily for that.<br /><br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> working perfectly on PAL now too (kept hitting reset to be sure it works with all possible PPU-CPU synchronizations). As predicted, it was much simpler to do there. Now to write a clear explanation and clean demo code.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sun Jun 20, 2010 3:07 am</p><hr />

OK, it took a few days to be sure I had all the timing worked out. Now I've got a little simulator program and understand it well, along with working test programs. But I want to be sure it's worth documenting and putting together demos for. I'm not that familiar with all the mid-frame PPU things you'd want to do, and which ones have tricky timing, so I'm seeking input on these. I'll describe what the requirements are and what it provides.<br /><br />Basically what this new technique provides is synchronization with the PPU as best as is technically possible. It is as if you cycle-timed everything. This means that with rendering enabled each frame, you can have a particular CPU cycle fall on one of two adjacent pixels in each frame. It will jiggle between them every frame, as this is a hardware limitation. So if you're doing raster graphics, the image will hardly shake. If you're doing timed writes during the frame, they won't jump around by several pixels. You will always fall on one of two particular adjacent pixels in the frame, since the PPU is synchronized with beforehand. The two pixels your write can fall on are the SAME regardless of PPU-CPU synchronization after power/reset.<br /><br />The requirements:<br />* NTSC NES only at the moment. If this proves a useful technique, I'll look into putting it on PAL.<br /><br />* Before enabling rendering, you call a synchronization routine. This takes about 18 frames on average, and blanks the scrreen while it's synchronizing. You can call this again to re-synchronize later, if necessary.<br /><br />* After synchronizing, you must enable NMI and enable rendering by the next frame and leave it enabled from that point.<br /><br />* Every frame from that point, you must increment a frame counter. If you don't need synchronization for a particular frame, you don't need to do anything more.<br /><br />* During frames you need synchronization, you must do sprite DMA during vblank (unlikely you aren't already doing this), and run about ten instructions of synchronization code at the end of vblank, just when the vblank flag is being cleared. All code in vblank before that point must be cycle-timed.<br /><br />* The loop that waits for NMI must be a HERE: JMP HERE style, and it must be executing when each NMI is triggered. No special NOP sequences are required, as I originally figured.<br /><br />* DMC samples can't be played, since they introduce too much jitter. MMC3 or similar scanline interrupt seems like the only way to get around this.<br /><br />The main question is how useful this might be.

Success! It was failing before because I was disabling rendering too soon, dumb bug on my part. Now to clean it up and add a page to the Wiki. A PAL version should be possible, and it will be simpler as PAL doesn't have short frames.<br /><br />It's kind of sad, because I had put so much into this completely-cycle-timed palette demo I'm making.

I think I'm going to get this working to where your wait-for-nmi loop can be made of a normal JMP loop.

In fact with a mapper that trigger an IRQ at a very predictable PPU clock (such as MMC3 or MMC5 but NOT any VRC series, FDS, N106, etc...) it could use the double interrupt method :<br /><br />Interrupt 1 prepare field for interrupt 2 the next scanline, and then go into a long string of nops, that are interrupted by interupt 2. Inside interrupt 2 you get 2 cycle error (which is 6 pixels NTSC and 6.4 (7 ?) pixels PAL, both fitting into 1 tile if you're lucky).<br /><br />I know they managed to somehow kill that remaining 1-cycle jitter on the C64 (which has a built-in scanline counter that can both trigger IRQs and be read at any time), however I don't know if that could be possible on NES. Maybe rely on obscure $2007 read behavior ?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Jun 16, 2010 6:23 am</p><hr />

Haha, right. This wouldn't be useful for code that isn't <em>entirely</em> cycle-timed. I'd be very surprised if you could even reduce the jitter to three pixels with such code, as it would require landing on the same CPU clock each frame. Have you actually managed to do this? The best I can think of is an NMI routine with the CPU sitting in a series of two-cycle instructions (like a long string of NOPs), which would synchronize you to an accuracy of two CPU clocks (6 pixels).<br /><br />Hmmm... with this approach, if you could somehow determine whether your NMI code took an even or odd number of clocks, you could add an extra and synchronize down to the CPU clock, and use the scheme I described. Determining even/odd might be possible via a sprite #0 hit or something near the end of the frame. Argh, now I'm going to have to experiment with this at some point. It'd be pretty cool to be synchronized exactly to the PPU every frame...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Wed Jun 16, 2010 5:52 am</p><hr />

There's a description on the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Full_palette_demo" class="postlink">Wiki page</a>. You still have the three-pixel jagged vertical edges, but this latest version reduces the horizontal shaking to one pixel, which isn't very visible, basically just making the edges slightly softer.<br /><br />I'll attempt a more concise [er, longer it seems] version, covering some details I know you know but for the benefit of others.<br /><br />The PPU has long and short frames. Long frame is 341*262=89342 PPU clocks, or 29780 2/3 CPU clocks. If rendering is disabled, you get all long frames. Looking at where CPU cycles fall on the first scanline, it cycles through three positions:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">0--1--2-- frame 1<br />-0--1--2- frame 2<br />--0--1--2 frame 3<br />0--1--2-- frame 4<br />-0--1--2- frame 5<br />--0--1--2 frame 6<br />...</div><br />So with rendering disabled, there's no way to avoid the image shaking quite noticeably, with the jagged edges slowly moving along.<br /><br />If rendering is enabled, you get an alternation between long and short frames (a short frame is one PPU clock shorter than a long). This causes the position of the CPU cycles on the first scanline to only toggle between two positions:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">0--1--2-- frame 1<br />-0--1--2- frame 2<br />0--1--2-- frame 3<br />-0--1--2- frame 4<br />0--1--2-- frame 5<br />-0--1--2- frame 6<br />...</div><br />So it seems you can just enable rendering during the time where the PPU skips a clock every other frame, and have the image not shake. But the problem is that your code also has to delay one CPU cycle extra every other frame, as the average length of a short and long frame includes half a CPU cycle fraction (29780.5).<br /><br />So your code is delaying one extra CPU cycle every other frame, and the PPU is skipping a pixel every other frame. When you delay an extra clock, you effectively move your image three pixels to the right. On long PPU frames, the PPU effectively moves the image to the left by one pixel, and on short, to the left by two pixels. You have a choice as to which PPU frames you delay an extra CPU clock on, either short or long. You want to delay the extra clock and move your image right three pixels on frames that the PPU moves it two to the left, so that they result in only one pixel shift right.<br /><br />If you do it wrong, you'll move the image three pixels right when the PPU moves it only one to the left, resulting in it moving a total of two to the right. Then on the next frame, the PPU will move it two to the left, and you'll have much more noticeable shaking.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">0--1--2-- frame 1<br />--0--1--2 frame 2<br />0--1--2-- frame 3<br />--0--1--2 frame 4<br />0--1--2-- frame 5<br />--0--1--2 frame 6<br />...</div><br />So in the code, I run long frames and synchronize to the PPU clock, then enable rendering and figure out whether the next frame is a short or long one, and delay one extra frame if necessary, so that everything is synchronized.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Wed Jun 16, 2010 2:46 am</p><hr />

Well Blargg, congratulation for this demo which was implemented in an incredibly clever way.<br />If I understand way, you managed to get completely rid of all jittering (or get only 1 pixel jitter I haven't understood exacly).<br />How did you manage this exploit ? I always got ~9 pixels (3 CPU clock) jittering at best (NTSC).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Jun 16, 2010 1:32 am</p><hr />
