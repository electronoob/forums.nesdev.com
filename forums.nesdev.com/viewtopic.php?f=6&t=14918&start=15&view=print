		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some MOD formats implement linear pitch (logarithmic frequencies) as discrete steps, I think commonly 64 per semitone? You could implement something similar with a table of 12 note frequencies * 20 divisions of the semitone, and apply octaves through bit-shift operations. This would make linear pitch slides very simple, though granular, but I wouldn't expect the granularity to be a significant problem.<br /><br />If you're talking about tool/UI notation as well, most musical editors I've seen generally treat a pitch slide as an effect applied to a note that otherwise appears &quot;flat&quot;. MIDI piano roll editors will often just show a note as a straight horizontal bar, and a pitch bend would be an effect applied to the channel (visible on a separate control track below the note field, sometimes). With MOD trackers similarly you just play a note and then apply pitch changes in the effect column. I mentioned with lilypond how you just write <em>\glissando</em> between two notes for that, etc, which seems fine for text-based input.<br /><br />PXTone does a piano roll, but I think it actually notates pitch bends with a bent note bar to show where it ends, which is pretty cool. (I don't have it installed or I'd take a picture.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />With formats such as MOD/IT/XM/S3M, there are two common kind of portamento which can be &quot;Amiga portamento&quot; (meaning working with period values) or &quot;linear portamento&quot; (meaning working with a logarithmic scale). There are then commands which apply portamento up or down by a specified speed. AmigaMML (which compiles into MOD/XM) supports two methods of specifying portamento, which are command envelopes (which are almost direct MOD/XM commands), and auto-portamento (only for XM with linear slides) which are indicated with a slash between notes (but I don't know if any other program does something similar to the way AmigaMML does it).

If, after having designed the sound engine, it really turns out to be too slow, you can always optimize it using tables later. You can also do the (a+b)^2 - a^2 - b^2 trick, which makes some types of multiplication very fast on the 6502.<br /><br />Also for the pitch table granularity trick, I think 21 pitches values per semitones could be a useful values as it prevents the octave table to be more than 255 entries. It is not as intuitive as using a power of 2 though.

In an engine targeted at NSFs and stand-alone music ROMs, such as FamiTracker's own engine, I could get away with fairly complex arithmetic. But Pently is targeted at real-time games. If I were to make a rule &quot;portamento is permitted in menus and in turn-based games, just not in-game during real-time games&quot;, that would just turn into &quot;Could you make portamento faster?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In particular, the problem is the extreme dynamic range expected of a portamento effect. Some compositions using portamento want a rate of multiple semitones per frame, while others might be as slow as one semitone per second.<br /><br />Pitch bend in MIDI sends the equivalent of one update per frame. <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">Ex yy zz</tt> sets the pitch bend for channel x+1 to z*128+y, where that value ranges from 0 (minimum) through 8192 (centered) to 16383 (maximum). The range from minimum to maximum is implementation-defined, but PC-based MIDI implementations appear to default to a range of four semitones (center plus or minus two), and some synths allow changing the range using &quot;registered parameter&quot; control messages. But this representation is probably too data-dense for NES use, much like the rest of the MIDI and Standard MIDI File formats.<br /><br />Trackers offer three models for pitch bend, all of which add or subtract a particular amount per frame as long as the effect is in operation. All support the period model; XM and IT also support a logarithmic model with 16 units per semitone.<br /><br /><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li><strong>Open-loop portamento</strong><br /><tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">1xx</tt> (MOD, XM, FTM), <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">Fxx</tt> (S3M, IT): Slide up.
