		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, VirtuaNES is my emulator of choice if the there are people using the TV, and I can't use the NES. To me, it's by far the best emulator in terms of speed, and still keeping updated enough to be worth something. I've been using v.092 though, because my old retrousb controller wouldn't work with v.092, so I never bothered updating.
<br />
<br />I don't know why Nestopia runs slow on my system, because it didn't use to. I have a 3200+ AMD processor and 512 of RAM, so I don't know what gives. I do know that the accuracy of the games has been surpassing Nintendulator though, as when I was developing Tic-Tac XO, I found a problem with the way I was doing delays back then. I was actually doing a <em>very cruddy</em> way, which I didn't know at the time, where I was constantly waiting for vblanks. Of course vblanks get missed, but the side effect is that even playing music in the NMI causes the tune to drag. This wouldn't happen in Nintendulator, and the only way I found this happening before testing on an NES was through testing in Nestopia.
<br />
<br />More recently, my minigame compo entry !Clik! has a problem with saving a high score on reset, which apparently has something to do with the way I handled CHR-RAM. This only happened in Nestopia, but then was confirmed on the NES itself from two different people. 
<br />
<br />So, this is why I use Nestopia as my "test before hardware test emulator". It just seems to have surpassed Nintendulator in that respect, though I wish it wouldn't have, because Nintendulator runs so much better on my system.
<br />
<br />I can't say I ever had any input lag on Nestopia though. It's just an issue of having to set priority on it, for me.
