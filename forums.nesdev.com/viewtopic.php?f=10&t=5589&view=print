		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am just trying to figure out how sprite manipulation is done in my favorite NES rom.
<br />
<br />The point in the game I am looking at is after the ball has been snapped and the players are moving around.
<br />
<br />I set a breakpoint for writes to $2003 and I see that 00 is written there each frame.
<br />
<br />I do not see any writes to $2004.
<br />
<br />I do see a write to $4014 every frame. So it appears to be accessing SPR-RAM via DMA.
<br />
<br />At the breakpoint, the FCEUX debugger gives the line:
<br />00:C153:8D 14 40  STA $4014 = #$FF
<br />
<br />This means that $FF is in the accumulator, right?
<br />
<br />So this should cause the 256th page to be written to the SPR, which would be FF00-FFFF?
<br />
<br />I can't get it to break for any writes to this range. This would be mapped to the ROM?
<br />
<br />Any ideas what is being done here? Is there some mirroring involved?
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />Fredrick

Rather, you need to find the field in the debugger that shows A, note what the contents are as it executes that write.  But you could almost surely tell by looking at the instruction right before STA $4014.
<br />
<br />I would hazard a guess you'll find it on the $0200 page (seems to be a favorite).  But it will almost definitely be in $0200-$0700 range, and always use the same page.  If you're familiar enough with sprite RAM organization it's super easy to spot the page in a memory viewer while the game is running.

<br />I want to say I remember a homebrew game updating sprites from ROM, but I'm not sure. It should be possible though, unless the NES only considers the lower bits of the data written to $4014, which is unlikely.
<br />
<br />Anyway, 99% of the games use $4014 and never touch $2004. And 90% of those use page $02 as the OAM buffer. I've seen $2004 used as a crude scanline detector (in the game <em>Super Cars</em>), but never for updating sprites.

<br />Yeah if it is REALLY static and if you use all spites, which is unlikely.
<br />
<br />But I don't see a reason not use a page of $6000-$7fff SRAM for sprites, just that I've never seen any game do this. Maybe they were afraid about the fact to DMA from the cart instead of internal RAM ?

<br />Exactly. If such a screen uses lots of sprites (close to 64), it's better to just load the data directly from ROM than to waste space with code that copies it to RAM just to upload to OAM from there.

<br />Hell, most programmers seem to be afraid of using anything but page 2!

<br />Tetris 2 uses a title screen full of sprites so that the cutout in the brick wall isn't restricted by 16x16 attribute limitations. I haven't traced it, but I'm guessing it copies the table to RAM first so that it can have a sprite pointing to "1PLAYER GAME / 1P VS 2P / 1P VS COM". It's only nine bytes to do so:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">:<br />&nbsp; lda sprite_table,x<br />&nbsp; sta oamBuffer,x<br />&nbsp; dex<br />&nbsp; bne :-<br /></div>
