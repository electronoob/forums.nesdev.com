<br />You won't get the full dump when dumping it as NROM. That would be just used to dump the menu part, which you/somebody would then need to reverse engineer to find out how the menu selects different games, and then write add support to TapeDump based on that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />-F10 is not necessarily needed for 1200 bps, but it may be for 2400 and 5200.  After I record at a lower bps, I usually remove any pops at the beginning of dumping and then normalize the waveform to maximum volume.  Thus, adjusting the offset (DC bias, really) is not necessary.  Anyway, for 5200 bps, the waveform is much more rounded and misshapen, any kind of massaging can help KCS to decode it.

It'll be great if someone can do this... Thank you!

<br />EDIT: I have flipped the mirroring switch on my tapedump cartridge and recorded the thing again, now I got a smaller file...??? Here's the decoded <a href="http://jpx72.detailne.sk/upload/ROCKNEW.NES" class="postlink">FILE</a>. 
<br />EDIT2: although on second try, I got the same file as I got before switching the mirroring. This second file must be some mistake.

<br />You are getting different results semi-randomly because the lower bank registers of the mapper start at random values. For figuring out the mapper this doesn't matter, only the last 8K of the ROM matters in this case, so both ROMs are fine. As for why the graphics are garbled, the CHR banking regs are random at startup as well. This also doesn't matter for this task.
<br />
<br />I'll see if I can find time to take a look at this later.

<br />
<br />Looks like it has atleast 3 control registers, 5010, 5011, 5012.
<br />
<br />This is a data table of the values written when loading games. The first value goes to $A000, then to the 50xx in order. It writes these registers from a small code segment loaded into the 2K WRAM which then clears RAM, resets various registers, and does a JMP ($FFFC).
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">$A000,$5010,$5011,$5012<br />XX,00,00,20, Menu, CHRROM?, 8K PRG?,8K CHR?<br />00,22,10,55, Rockman, CHRRAM, 128K PRG<br />80,21,20,AA, Rockman 2, CHRRAM, 256K PRG<br />00,11,30,20, Rockman 3, CHRROM, 256K PRG &amp; 128K CHR<br />80,20,40,55, Rockman 4, CHRRAM, 512K PRG<br />00,01,00,00, Rockman 5, CHRROM, 256K PRG &amp; 256K CHR<br />80,20,60,AA, Rockman 6, CHRRAM, 512K PRG</div>
<br />
<br />And it seems the games are in order they appear on the menu. So to read any game, the MBR can be set to these values, and then you read all the banks as though they are MMC3 games most likely.
<br />
<br />The most interesting thing about this being dumped will be seeing the MMC3 hacked Rockman 1 and 2 since the rest of the games all use MMC3. 
<br />
<br />Update: I added some info next to the table incase anyone wants to speculate what the values written likely do.
<br />
<br />$20 to $5010 seems likely to enable CHRRAM. The lower nibble could be related to PRG Block size, x0 being 512k, x1 256K, x2 128K.
<br />
<br />Not sure what the deal with $A000 is since that is the MMC3 mirroring register and they only write clear or set of the highest bit.
<br />
<br />If you are using TampDump via PowerPAK you can edit the TxROM plugin and remove something not needed, like detecting Mirroring since we know it'll be mapper controlled, and add in code then to set the MBR (5010,5011,5012, and maybe A000) and then have the plugin try dumping each game normally as if its TxROM.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />$5011 could be selecting a block of a large PRG-ROM if they mirror Rockman 1 to 256K I think. $5012 maybe CHRROM page with junk values for the CHR-RAM games?

<br />Yes, thank you I am now aware of that and I'm thankful that you released those. Nevertheless I must try to find someone who will help me edit them, because I simply don't understand that. All I want is to dump this pirate for anyone who's interested.
