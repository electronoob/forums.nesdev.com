<br />
<br />I'm starting a new topic because the old topic is bloated.  To sumerize and add information:
<br />
<br />I have a famicom to nes adaptor that I have moded to pass the extra famicom sound to the expansion slot.  On the expansion slot I want to connect pin 3 (audio in) and pin 40 (connects to pin 18 on the cart which is the cart pin I use to pass the famicom sound).  
<br />
<br />I wanted to find some sort of connector, but there doesn't seem to be one that will work without a lot of work.  Since the adaptor mod isn't very complicated, I also want this to be simple enough for anyone to do.  I want to do it without moding the nes itself.   Here is my current solution:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://img149.imageshack.us/img149/9792/attemptone8xq.jpg">http://img149.imageshack.us/img149/9792 ... one8xq.jpg</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />as you can see, I'm just mutilating very small alligator clips.
<br />
<br />Drk421 mentioned using a a 100K resistor in series with a 4.7uF non-polarized cap as part of his famicom sound mod.  I decided to put the cap and the resistor on the famicom to nes cartridge adaptor so that the expansion port mod could be as simple as possible.
<br />
<br />The only real problem is that it's still not small enough for the expansion port cover to go back on.  I'm sure that I chop the clip up a bit more and that it will then fit fine.  It's also a bit tedious to count pins and get the clips on right.
<br />
<br />Questions:
<br />
<br />1.  Does anyone have some sound files of how castlevania III famicom is supposed to sound that I can make sure mine sounds correct?
<br />
<br />2.  Anyone have any ideas to improve this expansion port connector?  Since I've given up on a plug, does anyone have any other ideas of how to connect these two pins without modifying the nes?  Please let me know of any better smaller clips!

<br />
<br />I haven't a clue what kind of port that is - even the docs here on the site are without much info.  One doc, and I forgot which one, did mention that the connectors for this are very tough to find, and may not be made anymore.
<br />
<br />Your best shot is to painstakingly measure the dimensions of the pin pitch (center-to-center measurement), number of pins and 'board thickness' of the port and see if you can find a match with something online.  My guess is that it might match some small cart edge connector types with metric dimensions of some kind.
<br />
<br />Your other option is to just do a permanent hack, and solder up some stuff, possibly with a switch (in the case of some carts not having the expansion pins properly isolated. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm currently modifying an NES for this very purpose. However I'm soldering wires. I'm also modifying a 60-72pin adapter as well. Unfortunatly my adapter has the expansion port pins left off so I'm going to have to use an external cable instead of doing it the easy way. I'd probably give making my own cartridge adapter a shot but who knows where to get those parts. 
<br />
<br />I did discover that in order to use an external sound source, say the output of a CD player, you not only have to ground it properly, but you have to put a 100 ohm resister between the ground and the audio output. I'm not sure if this is required or not for famicom carts but if it is that's not a problem. I can do it. Without the resistor it's bairly audible. Of course this mixes with the standard NES audio so unless you're developing some sort of external NES device for storing games then this information isn't worth much. 
<br />
<br />I don't understand why american game developers didn't take advantage of the extra sound input on the expansion port and the fact that you can access it from the cartridge slot. A simple jumper pack on the expansion port and they could have used enhanced music on their NES games. 
<br />Heck they could have included an enhanced sound chip on the pack and it would have worked as well. No more complicated than installing the expansion pack on the N64 really.
<br />
<br />By the way, if you haven't found a way yet, I can provide the music for Castlevania 3. let me know.

<br />Because Nintendo was likely not willing to manufacture such a jumper pack, and unlicensed developers likely did not know about Famicom sound or the expansion port.

<br />
<br />So did the stock 2A03 audio, and it probably got used more because there was no way to add extra audio chips. I personally find Castlevania III's music much more enjoyable than Akumajo Densetsu's muddled saw wave crap. Namco 106 music doesn't fare much better either.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Maybe so. That's a matter of opinion I suppose. 
<br />But Lagrange Point's music was good. Not just an enhanced version of the standard NES sound but some nice FM Synthesis audio. 
<br />There were creative things done with the 2A03 audio, but few can argue that there aren't benifits to being able to add upgrades. The FX chip for example. But even with the Super NES's ability to add chips in the cartridge you still had games like the DK country series that didn't need them. So there are also definatly benefits to being creative with the system's normal abilities. I suppose the question is would developers tend to  ignore the system's normal abilities if they had the option to add an upgrade? I'm not sure they would. Very vew games used an enhanced sound chip on the famicom, and very few games used the FX chip (or any other upgrade chip) on the SuperNES. 
<br />They're pretty much novelties. Just fun for a few games, not good for all games. And it would have been fun had some games had some enhanced sound.

<br />I agree. I don't really know why, but I found the music in Casltevania III sounds more "limpid". In Akumajo Densetsu III, they used more channels for Chrous and echo effects, but not for actually more channels. They just rewired all triangle stuff on the saw wave channel. The advantage is that the VRC6 saw vave has volume control. But I still prefer Castlevania III.
<br />However, you have to admit that the music in Just Breed is awesome, and that two identical additionnal square channels are quite good.
<br />
<br />The same goes for the super FX chip on the SNES : All games using it are pure crap. I prefer good 2D games than 3D games with terrible graphics. All the best SNES games does have no special chip.

<br />Including <em>Yoshi's Island</em>, which used the Super FX for GBA style sprite rotation and scaling rather than for making a true 3D world?

<br />Oh yeah. But I think it is do-able without the Super FX chip. Scaling at least, Chrono Trigger and Tales of Phantasia does this without the FX chip. Rotating would be a bit more tricky, but few sprites if any rotates in Yoshi's Island. Actually I don't like it too much either. The graphics are so odd... But everyone seems to love that game. Whathever. A good use of the FX chip would be 3D characters in a pre-rendered 2D or 3D isometric world. However, the output polygons looks like crap.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Also the FX chip wasn't the only special chip. The DSP chip for example was in alot of classics like pilot wings and mario cart. The SA-1 Chip was also in the Kirby games and Mario RPG, and the C4 chip was in the later Megaman X games. Streetfighter Alpha 2 and Star Ocean had a chip called S-DDP which was just a decompression chip. It was cheaper than adding more ROM space. Most of these games except for pilot wings and mario kart are 2D. And those just use the DSP chip for enhanced mode 7 which isn't true 3D anyway. 
<br />
<br />Also, Doom used the FX chip and it wasn't bad. It wasn't the greatest but it was a decent port for a 16 bit system.
