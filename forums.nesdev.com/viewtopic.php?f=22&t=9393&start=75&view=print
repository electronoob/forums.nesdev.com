Is Streemerz v02 the official version we'd like in the bundle?<br /><br />Some updates on my end:<br />I purchased all the electrical components I need, and have them ready to go.  I'm going to start programming the CPLD/mappers this week.  I'll be ready to program EPROMs whenever the official ROM is ready.  Not at the point where it's holding me back or anything.  That point shouldn't be for another week or two.  Any last minute details we still need to iron out on the ROM?<br /><br />I purchased the cases online today for $4.09 each including shipping.  EPROMs were $2 each, I'll have to go back and check but everything I quoted previously should have been accurate in my costs.<br /><br />I've got a source for labels at no charge <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Nobody's stepped up to the plate on designing the graphic for the label still.  Assuming this doesn't happen this week I'm planning on working on something myself this weekend.<br /><br />Still on target, and hoping to have everything assembled and up for sale via my site by the end of the month. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I'm going to talk with Jim's Cool about how his multi-region CIC is coming along.  So far I can only assure the sale of NTSC CICs.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Alright getting down to the nitty gritty here.  <br /><br />I don't claim to be an artist, but since there weren't any that stepped in I broke out the MS paint skills...<br /><br />It's a little busy, but I got most of the contributions included since I didn't feel the need to pick favorites <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  I figured it was easier to add now and take away later if desired.  Something's could probably be better arranged but it's late and I wanted to atleast get a draft posted ASAP.<br /><br />I sprinkled in Twaite everywhere partially because it was easy and also because it was the compo winner.  And the biggest was Streemerz since it was the main feature.  Everything is a direct screenshots from the game, didn't scale anything besides the upside down label at the top.  If someone has a better image or version of what to put on the top label I'd be welcome and appreciated, my version is admittedly pretty lame...<br /><br /><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/18341918/Action53%20label.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />If everyone's cool with the label I'll order those before the end of the week.<br /><br />I have 50 clear cases on hand thanks to Retrozone for selling those to us at discount.  Ended about the same as free shipping in the end.<br /><br />I've started assembly on the boards and would like to wrap them up this week.  I'm to the point now that a final rom would be of use so I could start programming these EPROMs and get em soldered in to finish things up.<br /><br />Only item that needs to be resolved for some is CIC regions.  Currently only NTSC is tested on the JCIC.  Any one concerned about shipping out CICs to PAL or other regions that isn't fully tested?  Perhaps someone (hopefully with a AVR programmer) could volunteer in each region?  Then any one with concerns could be shipped after verification.  I'm open to ideas/solutions here.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I reverted to FCEUX 2.2.0. Between 2.2.0 and 2.2.1, the mappers were reorganized, and #28 was inadvertently dropped. I was then able to make the first release candidate build: &quot;R.C.#1&quot;. The change from beta 4 is the use of the final streemerz-v02 ROM. If this ROM works on the final production hardware, I'll release a tool that takes the chosen RC and generates a serially numbered ROM to burn onto a cartridge. I'm using serial numbers because there's someone on NA who likes to have #37 of every release or something like that.<br /><br />Should we think about a manual?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Everything works on the final boards.  BUT streemerz no longer supports exiting back to the main multi menu.  The option isn't even there, so I'm guessing it's just an issue with integrating the mulit-version into the latest streemerz version.<br /><br />As for the cart numbering.  I think it's a cool idea for this batch of 50, making them unique and all.  Not sure I'm interested in having people fighting over numbers or keeping track of who's supposed to get what specific cart...  But if it's just the one guy or a few others I don't have a problem with making sure they get the desired number.  If it becomes a headache I'll quickly loose interest and name them all #37 as rainwarrior suggested. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />I have played around a little with my programmer.  I REALLY don't want to have to load a new file into my programmer app.  I can easily modify the ROM image from within my programmer app though.  So if you just give me a specific byte to manually increment with each EPROM it'll be nice and easy for me to handle.  I see streemerz is in the first banks, I assume your the multi engine is in the last bank and there appears to be some unused data near the reset vectors.  So something like $7FFE0 would be a good place that's easy for me to navigate to.  <br /><br />Additionally as discussed previously part of my testing of each cart is to dump it with the kazzo and verify the checksum.  I'll whip up the mapper dumping script for it.  But the checksum will be different for each ROM.  You had mentioned calculating the checksums via a python script, something like that would be nice but not required I can always manually calculate the checksum with my hex editor if need be.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, where will the build number be displayed when playing on the NES?

The hex to ascii conversion is visible in the same pane so that helps out.<br /><br />Does we need thefox to supply a multi version (with exit to menu) of the latest build of streemerz for us?
