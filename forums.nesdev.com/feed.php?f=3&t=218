While we're somewhat on the subject of Micro Machines... I'm noticing it relies on oddball bg color behavior to draw it's multicolored bars.  If you just use palette[0], ugly black patches get placed in their stead.<br /><br />I recall that games have to reset the palette address before using the PPU address.  I've seen code like the following in several games:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDA #$3F<br />STA $2006<br />LDA #$00<br />STA $2006<br />STA $2006<br />STA $2006<br /></div><br /><br />I'm guessing the first address set resets something relating to the palette which specifies palette[0] to be used as the background color... and the second write moves the ppu address away from the palette so that further PPU action won't change the BG color.<br /><br />Am I close?  I've tried using varying background colors in attempts to get the bars showing up in Micro Machines.  I've gotten close to correcting it with the following logic:<br /><br />On the second $2006 write - set the BG color to (PPU_Address &amp; 0x0C)<br />On writes to ppu $3F00-$3FFF (through $2007) - set the BG color to the same after the increment.<br /><br />This gets the bars dispaying properly, but doesn't reset the BG color back to black like it should (messing up the BG color for later in the frame).<br /><br />Anyway... I know I'm barking up the right tree with this.  I've been tinkering with several ideas but I just can't seem to get it to work right.  How exactly is the BG color determined?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any help any of you can give me.<br /><br /><br />EDIT  ---<br /><br /><br />Thanks to some info by Hyde, I've been able to get it working!  I'm using the methods above... along with the same implimentation on $2007 reads... but I'm only using that BG color when BG rendering is disabled.  When BG rendering is enabled... I use $3F00 regardless.  This seems to fix the problem.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> â€” Wed Mar 02, 2005 11:41 pm</p><hr />
