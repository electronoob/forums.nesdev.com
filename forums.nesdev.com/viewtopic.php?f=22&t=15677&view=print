		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's been a while since I've posted I guess. Anyways, after four years of learning to program I have finally (mostly) finished my first real project, Spook-o'-tron! It is up on Kickstarter at the moment <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1115970826/spook-o-tron-a-halloween-themed-homebrew-game-for" class="postlink">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1115970826/spook-o-tron-a-halloween-themed-homebrew-game-for</a>.  That link has a better video than I can really post here, and there is also a ten level demo. It is a Robotron-like game and features a full level editor. I'm using KS as a way to get community involvement with the building of levels, as that ended up being one of the most enjoyable aspects of the project. I had planned on submitting part of the game to the Compo, but the deadline kind of came and went.<br /><br />Besides really coming to understand how sprites work, the one big thing that I wanted to do with the game was find a way to use the Virtual Boy controller to create a unique gameplay experience. I'd guess that a lot of people knew that it could be done, but I don't think that anyone has created a game to use it in this way. Spook-o'-tron also features SNES controller support.<br /><br />NESDEV has been an invaluable resource when learning things, and as I have come to understand more about programming (zero prior experience) I have spent more and more time here. At first I was just kind of pushing numbers around and rearranging the Nerdy Nights, and then getting a lot of instruction on the side from people (KHan, Memblers, bunnyboy, MRN, etc.), but now I can actually read the resources and make sense of them <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />. Well, most of the time anyways. I am also returning to some of the questions that I asked here years ago for my next project, and am finally able to make sense of the answers that you guys gave me (mid-frame palette swaps, lighting effects). It has been a fun journey, and thanks for all of the help along the way, it has not gone to waste!<br /><br /><img src="https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/815/422/c34e4920819766f988fa81be94785bbd_original.PNG?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1489159128&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=46f97b563fa5a828d136f0c8ee93fb19" alt="Image" />
