Can someone please point me in the right direction on how to wire up 2 x 801's please?<br /><br />Thanks<br />MS

I am hoping that you speak on behalf of yourself as others might be willing to go a bit further. Also I'm not sure why your treating this question as a &quot;trade secret&quot; I obviously can use a 2A3B/3M board etc. I have however a few BA3M boards which I would hate to waste so I want to make best use of these if possible.

Pin 31 goes to hole 26, and pin 24 goes to hole 33. You do this for each chip.<br /><br />The MAD-1 is left completely alone&quot;<br /><br />can you at least clarify your comments; <br />where does pin 26, hole 24/31 go? these seem to be abandoned and not used if i follow your comments above<br />thanks in advance

This group is more about --- do your research and while we (this group) won't just hand out an answer, but will do is push you in the right direction so that you can learn what you want to know and <em>maybe</em> get confirmation on your questions at that point. <br /><br />Without tooting my own horn, there are other new repo pcb boards avail than just those mentioned in the prev post.  <br />Good luck!

Damm!! Even hexadecimal numbering was considered a thing of another world!!<br />I ended learning the basics of it at university, on the architecture &quot;chair&quot; (I don't know how the parts of a university course are called, so I'm using the word &quot;chair&quot; that is what it's called here...).<br />I ended up learning a lot more here in the forums. But still there's a huge amount of things i need/want to learn!<br /><br />Good luck!
