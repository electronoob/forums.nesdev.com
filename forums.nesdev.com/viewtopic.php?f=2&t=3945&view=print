		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've made a programm who can perform scaling and rotating on the NES on a small 64x64 pixel zone unsing CHRRAM and matrix multiply and on both bitplanes. The source and ROM image are uploaded <a href="http://jonathan.microclub.ch/rotation/" class="postlink">here</a> (it assembles with WLA-DX).
<br />Scale the picture with up and down, and rotate it with left and right. A reset scaling and B reset rotating.
<br />
<br />However, due to the slow CPU of the NES, it currently takes about 90 frames for the CPU to process the image (the CPU should perform 4096 times the process of matrix multiply, ROM acess/bit shifts to read the poper pixel, and then write it on the ouput buffer).
<br />I recommend using an emulator with very high frameskipping features (like VirtuaNES) for now.
<br />
<br />If anyone have idea how fast this up (exept making the mode 7 zone smaller), by all means say it !

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, what you said should probably work better for scaling only, but when if comes to scaling+rotating, I don't know if this method is any better effective than matrix multiply. The approach is different, instead of having a fixed output pixel position and calculate it's corresponding input pixel, you do the other way arround, take a fixed input pixel and calculate where on the output it should be. This will need much less time when it comes to reading original pixels, but you'll need a huge routine calculating where those should be put on the output buffer anyway. Also you'll need to buffer the whole frame at once doing it like this.
<br />
<br />I just wanted to do the matrix approach to do it like the SNES does, but if I were to implement some kind of scaling in a game I wouldn't do it as it because it's way too slow.

<br />Once, I investigated scaling for 32x32 pixel sprite cels, but my back-of-envelope cycle counting showed that it would run way too slow for what I wanted to do with it. Precomputed rotation is probably the only rotation that can be done in real time on the NES, but I'd love for someone to prove me wrong.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, EXACTLY like Elite. That is the game I was thinking about. But I don't know how that game does it's line function. Actually, I made a wireframe simulator in Qbasic using a combination of the line function and the raycasting equation. I was thinking I could transfer it to the NES someday like Elite. However, I'm just wondering about the line function itself and how it works. It seems incredibly difficult to deal with slopes and whatnot when you're working with 1 dimension. This concept could be applied to rotating a block of graphical data.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Honnestly, I'd say wireframe doesn't look too good for a game. I'd look good on the screen of a computer inside of a game or something like this, but a game (or miniagame) made entierely of wireframe like Elite would become quickly annoying.
<br />
<br />To draw a line, I guess the easiest way is to have your start point and ending point, and then start drawing the start point, increase X by some amount and Y by some other amount (the amount is some fraction of the vector made from the differences of the coordinate between your start point and end point), and continue like that unltil you reach the end point. The problem is that if you may loose presision and "miss" the end point.
<br />
<br />Acess the CHRRAM on a pixel based fashion is incredibly confusing and slow (in fact my Mode7 ROM doesn't do this, it acess the CHR data in ROM in that fashion, but the way to acess it is exactly the same).

<br />Look up Bresenham's line algorithm. It's fast, doesn't use multiplications or divisions and uses only integers. This is as good as it gets with lines.
