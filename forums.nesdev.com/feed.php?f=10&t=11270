Even though it's not technically a part of the cartridge, if you ever used the CIC chip, or used any cart to PC hardware, you would need to know the clock, so it makes sense a PAL/NTSC flag is in the header, as the hardware is dependent on that. But also, you forgot the vaus+normal controller set up, my game can use all 4 combinations, and if I decide to add my mini game, my game will support 6 input configurations. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Tue May 27, 2014 7:18 am</p><hr />

Well, I look at it similarly to how I would treat a PAL/NTSC flag. This flag tells you what configuration the cartridge is intended to be plugged into. It's a default setup, not necessarily a list of all things it could use. Unless overridden by the user, an .NES flagged as PAL should start up in PAL emulation mode. If the ROM supports both, the user will need to select the non-default option manually. (Would 3gengames suggest doing PAL detection by CRC too? It's certainly not part of the cartridge.)<br /><br />For all three cases you mentioned, the standard 2 controller setup (most likely identified by the number 0 in this scheme) is a perfectly appropriate default. If desired, one of the setup entries could be &quot;multi&quot;, which defaults to 2 controllers but is letting you know that this game has multiple peripheral configurations.<br /><br />A &quot;multi&quot; option most likely doesn't make it easier or harder for an emulator user, but it might help organize your ROMs with automated tools (e.g. display all zapper games).<br /><br />Back to the PAL flags, it looks like the current spec has: 0 NTSC, 1 PAL, 2 both but default NTSC, 3 both but default PAL. I think the lack of Dendy is a glaring omission, but ignoring that for the moment, this does cover all the non-Dendy use cases. NSF has the same two-bit field, more or less, and it led me to give the user 6 options in NSFPlay: 0 use default, 1 prefer NTSC for dual, 2 prefer PAL for dual, 3 force NTSC, 4 force PAL, 5 force Dendy.<br /><br />For peripheral setup, I don't think a bitfield would work very well. There'd be too many bits (at least 32?), and the number of useful combinations is very sparse (~30?). NSF made expansions a bitfield, and the homebrew music crowd made a horrendous and/or wonderful mess out of it-- this bitfield was probably a mistake (but a fun one). I think an indexed registry like we have with mappers would work well. Something like:<br /><br />0 - 2 controllers (generic, neither microphone or controller 2 start is essential)<br />1 - multi (2 controllers default)<br />2 - zapper in 2<br />3 - 2 controllers NES (start on controller 2 is essential)<br />4 - 2 controllers Famicom (microphone is essential)<br />5 - track and field pad<br />6 - family basic keyboard<br />7 - R.O.B. gyromite mode<br />8 - R.O.B. stack up mode<br />9 - power glove<br />10 - family basic keyboard<br />11 - miracle piano<br />etc... (a lot of these will be one-offs)<br /><br />Unlike mappers, it's also very optional. The user should normally be able to override the suggested setup, and a minimalist emulator author could ignore it entirely.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Tue May 27, 2014 5:44 am</p><hr />

How would you handle games that can use more than one type of controller? SMB/DH needs a controller in port 2 for Luigi in SMB1 but a Zapper in port 2 for Duck Hunt. SMB/DH/WCTM needs even more setups. The first Action 53 multicart can use controller, controller+Zapper, Zapper+Zapper, controller+mouse, or (I think) mouse+mouse. Would an entry in a controller registry be needed for each combination?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon May 26, 2014 9:13 pm</p><hr />

The wiki lists about 20 potential input devices, and most of them are really only used in one configuration; we don't need every permutation, just the ones that were used by games.

So what if it's not part of the cartridge? The NES zapper is a part of the game Duck Hunt just as much as the cartridge is. It's not playable without it. The famicom keyboard came in the package with Family Basic. The SNES mouse came packaged with Mario Paint. They're not the slightest bit inessential to emulating these games properly.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Mon May 26, 2014 8:42 pm</p><hr />

Clearly, the emulator authors using a CRC solution thought it improves usability to automatically select the appropriate controllers to use instead of having their users manually configure them upon switching games.<br /><br />I'd tend to agree. Instead of 1000 users being confused about why Duck Hunt doesn't work, you have 2 users confused why some Duck Hunt romhack doesn't work.<br /><br />A suggested peripheral setup in the header would alleviate the issue entirely. The other great thing about emulators is that they have options. If you want your emulator to allow someone to play the Duck Hunt ROM with two controllers instead, it can ignore the suggestion, or allow it to be overridden.<br /><br />Having more information in the header doesn't simplify emulator development if you don't want to use it, sure, but in the same situation it doesn't complicate it either (just another byte to ignore). That's not the goal, though, the goal is to simplify the user's experience. The number of users is orders of magnitude larger than the number of people developing the emulator. (Also, if the emulator developer was frustrated enough by the problem to put in a CRC based solution, clearly this <em>will</em> simplify it for them.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Mon May 26, 2014 2:44 pm</p><hr />

Many emulators use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function" class="postlink">hash function</a> to identify ROM images of individual commercial games so that the emulator can plug in reasonable settings without the user having to go to the trouble of setting up the emulator himself. When you make even the smallest change, the hash function produces a different value. For a user using only well-known commercial games, this provides the best user experience at the cost of a poor user experience when using ROM hacks or original homebrew games. Some emulator developers consider this an acceptable tradeoff.<br /><br />It might be easier for you to understand if I provide a worked example. Applying the CRC32 hash function to the PRG ROM of <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=307" class="postlink"><em>Hogan's Alley</em></a> produces the value $8963AE6E, and applying it to the CHR ROM produces $5DF42FC4. The database shipped with an emulator may have an entry to the effect &quot;When the PRG ROM is 128 Kbit with CRC32 $8963AE6E, and the CHR ROM is 64 Kbit with CRC32 $5DF42FC4, emulate a Zapper plugged into port 2.&quot; When you edit the tiles, the CRC32 value changes to something other than $5DF42FC4, causing this rule not to trigger.<br /><br />You might have to manually enable the Zapper in your emulator. The process for doing this will vary from one emulator to the next. Have your users read the manual of the emulator that they use.<br /><br />Have you tried your modified game on an NES with a Zapper and a CRT SDTV?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun May 25, 2014 8:47 am</p><hr />
