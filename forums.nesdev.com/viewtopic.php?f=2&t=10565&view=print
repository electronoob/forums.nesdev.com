		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi. I joined this forum to help get me an answer to<br />an nes cart idea thats been rolling around in my head for awhile. (unless its been done)<br />Yeah, its roomier then it looks  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />To start with, i know little about 6502 assembly (and programming in general),<br />but was considering makeing this my learner project. <br /><br />My basic idea was a rom (eventually made into the necessary cart EPROMs) that could<br />store passwords (like the 5+ i use online) in battery-backed ram. Nothing more<br />complicated then, say, 16 alpha-numeric characters (upper/lowercase, possibly some special chars)<br /><br />A further development would be to use the 6502 to sudo-randomly generate said passwords. I'm<br />not exactally sure how random it would be, as I'm fairly sure the NES's 6502 lacks anything as sophisticated as a modern cpu's random number generator. However, to add randomness to said generation, one could solicit input from the user (couple of sprites dancing on the screen and button presses, or even use the zapper)<br /><br />Even further developments beyond that would be a master password with x number of attempts<br />before the battery backed ram (I believe its SRAM) is wiped. For even MORE sneakyness, possibly<br />hide it somehow inside an existing game.<br /><br />I kinda like this idea because i never write down passwords and believe in never staying signed in.<br />Also at 36 my memory is already developing bad sectors  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> <br /><br />Again, I'm not sure how much of this is even possible. I did a few quick searchs of this forum and google but found nothing. However i should mention that my forum search-fu and google-fu are horrible...<br /><br />Anyhow, thanks in advance!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The NES contains an LFSR to generate noise. By itself, it's only a fancy timer. It takes either user input or analog noise input to make an actual random number generator. Fortunately, the NES has both.<br /><br /><strong>User input:</strong> Play a 1-byte sample with the DMC IRQ at rate $F (54 CPU cycles per sample, 8 samples per IRQ). This causes nearly 69 IRQs per frame. In the IRQ handler, read the controller, increment a seed, and add this seed to your entropy pool if a button is pressed or released since the last read. Mash buttons until enough entropy is collected, for about 16 bits per press and release. Rainwarrior's demo does this, just without the IRQ handler.<br /><br /><strong>Analog noise input:</strong> A technique that kevtris and I developed produces a few bits at power-on by exploiting analog effects of bus conflicts caused by reading $2007 while rendering is on. The &quot;Pretendo&quot; demo in <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=9796" class="postlink">topic 9796</a> demonstrates this. In the same topic, blargg suggested hashing the power-up state of OAM.

I think the percentage of people that still remember how to use them is small enough to consider this &quot;safe&quot;.

If someone might see it, use steganography, e.g. numeric passwords in the same format as phone numbers. If you want secure password generation, flip a coin multiple times for each character.

What if the guy wanted the cart ROM emulated?  There's no way to know if the emulator developer intentionally randomizes memory.<br /><br />He may have intended real hardware and real NES system only.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, polling the controller continuously will generate far more entropy on hardware than on an emulator. It wouldn't be hard to emulate this though, by choosing a random time during the frame for the new button state to take effect. Would add half a frame of latency on average though.
