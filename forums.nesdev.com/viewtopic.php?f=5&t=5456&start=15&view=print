A sport is something you do, not something you watch. A few guys are paid huge cash to play a game while a bunch of people that get absolutely nothing out of the victory of either team keep running this billionaire industry. There are even people killing each other because of teams.<br /><br />Here in Brazil it's some kind of crime to not root for any soccer team. People look at me like I'm an alien when I say I don't have a team. Everyone really goes "what's your team?", like not having one isn't even an option, I find it retarded. But it's true, 99% of the population roots for a team, including 90-year-old ladies.<br /><br />I guess people just like to watch other people doing things instead of doing them themselves for some reason. Stupid reality shows like Big Brother are big hits, and there's nothing really interesting going on, it's just a bunch of people doing regular things. Sex is another thing that's much more fun to do than watch, yet porn is... well, everyone knows how popular porn is.<br /><br />I don't mean to offend anyone here who does like (watching) sports, it's just that I don't get it. All I think this really does is create a world where a guy is paid millions to kick a ball around.</div>I agree, it's the same way in America depending on where you live ("which team are you on?").  I think the worst part is when kids end up sacrificing their education for an unlikely dream.  Sports players at many schools get to coast, due to pressures from coaches on other teachers to give them A's so they can remain on the team.  And then they graduate with neither knowledge nor a hope of playing professionally.

<br />There's no problem. "Grown-up toy" stores that sell radio control airplanes and helicopters made by Great Planes often sell copies of a flight simulator program called RealFlight, published by Great Planes. As far as I can tell, it's for fans of R/C planes to train during the off-season.

<br />I think if one were raised to be a hardcore worker, then that person would view any non productive object (Solely for entertainment purposes of course) as a toy.

<br />I dunno what the opposite would be, damn.
<br />Maybe I got the theory backwards. 
<br />
<br />My dad's a hard worker, I'm pretty sure he raised me to be one.

<br />
<br />That was my point. It's something you do.
<br />
<br />
<br />I mentioned sports because 'It isn't a job, and it isn't a toy neither... It's a game."
<br />
<br />
<br />Oh and when I mentioned "football" I didn't mean a football, I meant the set of rules and everything that revolves around a football. The game was the focus.
<br />
<br />
<br />Note: A "pigskin" was the football I was referring to.
<br /><img src="http://blog.evite.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/09/11/pigskin_invite.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />not the white one that resembles a toy.

<br />Yeah. I believe sports are games meant for recreation. But the number of people that made a recreation out of watching other people playing created the illusion that playing is a job/profession, but I believe that in the core they are still games.
<br />
<br />For the record, I guess video games are toys, yeah. But who says toys aren't important? Recreation is just as important as many other things in life for someone that expects to be happy. Grown ups can play with toys, why not? If it brings enjoyment and doesn't hurt anyone, it's fair game.

<br />Using them does seem pretty fun! =)
<br />
<br />But "wrecking ball" has the adjective in front of the noun to make it clear that it's a very specific type of ball, one not originally meant for recreation.

<br />And the whole reason I brought up sports was to define the contrast between toys and games.
<br />
<br />
<br />I'm a doer not a teacher, so I can understand why some of my examples are being brought out of context.

<br />I agree: those are "works", not "toys".
<br />
<br />A "game" is a stylized method of competition, usually involving playing with toys. Hockey is a game; the puck and sticks are toys. Chess is a game; the pieces are toys.
<br />
<br />A "video game" is a computer simulation of toys and of a game involving those toys. But the player need not play the game; there's an article on Slashdot right now about <a href="http://games.slashdot.org/story/09/08/08/0345231/Finding-New-and-Unintended-Ways-of-Playing-Games?art_pos=3" class="postlink">players who play their own games with the toys, not the intended game</a>. For example, a sandbox video game has plenty of toys, and the player can play the "game" (mission) or not. In SimCity, the player can put down zones (toys), and the player can choose to make a game out of it (scenarios) or not (marathon mode). In Grand Theft Auto 3 and later, the player can go steal cars (toys) and do sidequests (games) with or without entering the main mission (game).
