There must be something about the 2.2.1 release that had something weird to it, as I can see you're testing with older versions.<br /><br />As for not supporting MMC3, I'm talking about their reproPak boards (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=24&amp;products_id=42&amp;osCsid=e4673c1a06b54c488afed6c14e71dc37">http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.ph ... c14e71dc37</a><!-- m -->), which only support mappers 0, 2, 3, and 7. I can't buy MMC3 chips from a retailer so I don't want to use them. Unless I'm missing something.<br /><br /><br />Edit: the glitch was the whole scrolling section also scrolling vertically, which made no sense at all and I simply could not pinpoint the issue.<br /><br />Edit: I just checked version 2.2.0 and it works fine. I redownloaded v2.2.1 to have a clean folder and tested, and the glitch is there. The problem is definitely that specific version!

Thanks for the link.<br /><br />However, a nearly $10 production cost increase per cart is not exactly a small matter, especially considering the negligible cost of discrete parts. Though the ease of use of those boards (pre-built, more compatibility, etc) could be worth it in the end.

I ordered his flasher and a couple of upgraded boards already!<br /><br />I have converted my code over to MMC3, and while it was an interesting learning experience to write and test a generic scanline counter for splits, having a built in counter that doesn't waste my cycles is already a boon. And with battery backed RAM in addition to double the ROM size, everything I require for sweet NESsing is on the INL board! Pretty pumped.

Linux for example wasn't considered platform for gaming because no one made games for it and no one made games for it because no one was gaming on Linux. Until recently.<br /><br />It'll take some time until major players except Valve goes to Linux as target, but I'm digressing.<br /><br />I guess what I'm trying to say is that lack of ability to do something often inhibits any tries to do so. And often it's the other way around than you might think. Like with Linux gaming.

Don't denigrate others for choosing a slightly different set of limitations than you did. This is silly.

True, having MMC3 boards available is a good thing, but big games still need more effort, and beyond a certain point, artists want to be compensated in some manner. That and there's a fixed overhead of making each cart, and small games on discrete mappers make it easier to take advantage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling" class="postlink">bundling efficiencies</a> in much the <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2008/06/are-newspapers-doomed--posner.html" class="postlink">same way as the sections of a newspaper</a> by building a multicart.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Cost is definitely a huge thing, if not the biggest thing when it comes to the actual product and production. I am a jack-of-all-trades who needs a lot of graphics for this project, so something like the MMC3 is ideal, and I don't have to pay an artist because I'll be doing it myself. But discrete parts are super cheap (like 20 cents per chip) and if all you need is 8 kb of CHR ROM or something then using MMC3 &quot;just because&quot; is just throwing your money away. Not only that, but when I was working with the UNROM format, I learned a lot while trying to tackle the various issues I was having with its limits, which of course is invaluable.<br /><br />The main reason I am developing a new game for the NES is BECAUSE of the limitations. I find they force me to think in ways that I otherwise would never have given the virtually unlimited freedom of, say, PC development or Flash/Air. The constraints are what drive me to push the limits of the console as well as my own limits of creativity and problem solving.<br /><br />Either way, at the end of the day, Super Mario Bros is NROM. Enough said.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" />
