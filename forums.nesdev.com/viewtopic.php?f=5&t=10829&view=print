		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I used VS2010 for most of the development for Ghost in the Machine, then moved to VS2012 late 2013. The game also has been built for Linux and Mac OS X, and my C++ is 100% the same across platforms. Of course the build environment was different on each (g++ for linux until I switched to clang++, OS X using Xcode with clang). I'm sure you can find situations where your code will only work in VS, but I've noticed a lot of that comes from some slight laxness in implementation. By following standards, everything has worked without anything being VS / Windows specific.

So, the errors are opportunities for you to improve the code.</div><br />There are many non-compliant things that Visual Studio does, but most compilers are guilty of this to some degree. The most glaring to me are that MSVC lacks many parts of the C99 standard, such as initializing an array length with a variable, structure initialization with named members, stuff like that. There are also some minor differences in CRT implementation, how macros with variable arguments are implemented, etc. which can often be a source of cross platform compiler errors, even though there is no logical problem with the code itself.<br /><br />All that said, though, it's perfectly reasonable to learn what to avoid and develop cross platform code. I'm just saying that there are a lot of things you must do to achieve this that have nothing to do with &quot;improving&quot; the code, and more to do with appeasing the arbitrary whims of the compiler gods.

So, the errors are opportunities for you to improve the code.<br /></div><br /><br /> It's possible; I won't deny that. I did a lot of coding with lcc-win compiler over the years and the syntax was so forgiving that I picked up some bad habits. I then switched over to Gcc and had to correct a lot of stuff. I thought I was writing valid C++ code, but all my experience and learning has come from looking at examples on the 'net. Everyone thinks they're right and their way is the right way. It's hard to tell who's right and who's wrong. I've had compilers where I could predefine an array with a size of say 16megabytes inside main, and then later I would get a segment error (without show what gave the segment error) because the compiler updated and wouldn't allow such a size inside main. This happened a few times. If I moved the defined array into global area, everything was fine. I've had people tell me that you should dynamically allocate that memory. And maybe so, but the compiler allows you to setup such an array - then it should have no problem creating it at run time and destroying it on exit. I understand the purpose of allocating memory and de-allocating memory, but isn't always needed especially when you only need a few arrays for something simple. What is considered 'good practice' tends to be highly opinionated. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> Do you write games or other applications?</div><br /><br /> Right now? Just apps. But I have future projects that need game like engines (for prototyping console development on PC) as well as some emulation stuff.
