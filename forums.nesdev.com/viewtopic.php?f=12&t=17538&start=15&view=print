Maybe it would have been unreasonable to expect better under reasonable time and budget constraints, or for an affordable price.  Maybe it was a corporate afterthought or a contractual obligation and didn't get a reasonable schedule or budget.  Maybe the RAM-limited nature of the next-gen consoles made devs wary of pushing the SNES too hard for fear of making the PlayStation look bad.  Maybe the programmers were just lazy or incompetent.

These things are intimately related, and I think it's possible to fix all of them at once with a high-bandwidth HDMA streaming scheme.

I'm guessing it's because Star Ocean has been extracted and can be cloned without an S-DD1, while SFA2 hasn't.)<br /><br />Can an FPGA beat those prices?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Can the SD2Snes can run the SDD1 games?</div><br />They're still on the incompatibility list.

My way of doing it was dumping all and any S-DD1 compressed chunk and then, re-inserting each one as decompressed data. That is tedious, but you get the minimum ROM size.

If you have time, it'd be interesting to read what causes a particular kind of graphic to be compressed more or less than average, or comparison with the rate performance of the SPC7110 (another context-adaptive arithmetic decoder). At least this might help inform design of pure-software tile codecs for Game Boy and Super NES.

Scared me for a moment.<br /><br />Metal Slug seems to have 16 MB of C-ROM, based on the MAME manifest (though the MAME ROMs add up to more than 193 Mbit, so some of them are probably partly empty).  Could be 14-15 MB rescaled to SNES resolution, since the graphics probably won't reduce by the full 256/304 ratio because of tiling.  If that compresses down to about 7-8 MB, and audio can be squeezed down quite a bit because the SNES can re-pitch samples, it may be possible to do the game in about 9-10 MB, maybe with 8 MB behind the S-DD1 and 2 MB in parallel.  At worst I imagine 12 MB would be more than adequate, and by the time the S-DD1 came out the N64 was on the cusp of hosting games that big.<br /><br />SFA2 has 20 MB of graphics and 4 MB of audio data.  The former could easily be well below 16 MB when rescaled to SNES resolution, and since a lot of it is cartoony with a bunch of flat colour it might compress better than Star Ocean or Metal Slug.  Even if it doesn't, 7-8 MB is still a plausible estimate.  The audio should compress to about 2 MB with BRR, and we're left with a very similar scenario as with Metal Slug.<br /><br />So they should both work about as well as I had thought.  Thanks for the estimate.

He left untouched the first 48Mbit (the original ROM) then used 3 bank to make a big lookup table for pairing each compressed address with new uncompressed location in expanded ROM. Then added all of Dejap's GFX packs in the rest of the ROM.<br />The fact is the original 48Mbit can be exploited because part of it is S-DD1 compressed data (about 18 MBit aprox), and hundreds of Dejap's GFX chunks are not valid, so they shouldn't be included in the expanded ROM.<br />If you make the calculations, the original game has about 35 megabits of uncompressed data; 18 Megabits of that uncompressed data can be allocated in the original ROM, and the rest of if, in the expanded space: 48Mbit (original) + 17 (expanded) = 65 Mbit.<br />You can check this in the ROM layout document I uploaded to RHDN.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">93143 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Metal Slug seems to have 16 MB of C-ROM, based on the MAME manifest (though the MAME ROMs add up to more than 193 Mbit, so some of them are probably partly empty).

Everybody who might contribute, including me, is busy doing other stuff.<br /><br />But it's certainly fun to think about and talk about.  And there is one member here who arrived harbouring the intention to port Metal Slug to the SNES, and has given it a lot of thought, even if he now feels it would be too big a task for him alone.  A few other members are known to have been working on stuff that could be applicable to such a port, such as predictive animation, dynamic sprite VRAM allocation, and HDMA audio data streaming.  Not to mention an FPGA implementation of the S-DD1...  I can't rule out the possibility that this project may get off the ground someday.

You say you don't know if your implementation will work on hardware, so... which hardware did you run SFA2 and SO?<br />As for ROM access, 3 master cycles is the miminum for FastROM, since that means 139ns time access. FastROM is slower than 120ns, so 3 master cycles is the proper time access for SDD1 core.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />Ok, taking a look to the source code you provided, that implementation <strong>CAN'T work</strong> neither in real hardware nor in any other platform. The design lacks of 3 signals needed to manage the ROM output, and what's more, there is no SRAM_CS at all, so Star Ocean wouldn't work: if there is no SRAM present in the cartridge, audio engine stalls and the game freezes.<br />Still wondering how those videos were recorded...
