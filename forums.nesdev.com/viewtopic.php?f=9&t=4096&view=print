		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's been almost four years, and I decided it was about time to dig this all up and release it. It's collected quite a bit of dust on my hard drive and will need a little tweaking to get it working again, but it's almost all there.
<br />
<br />The Devtendo hardware requires both the communication software for the NES and PC. The package just released includes the full source code. It will need a few tweaks as some stuff is hard coded, but otherwise is good to go.
<br />
<br />NES cartridges can be read/written with it, and the software supports many different mappers. In addition, I built a Game Boy adaptor, so the software even supports GB carts fed through the NES!
<br />
<br />You should now have everything you need to make and use your own Devtendo (with a few tweaks)!

<br />Ive been visiting your website off and on for a couple years waiting for Grandtheftendo to be finished will it ever see the light of day im sure a few others are curious aboot it too.
<br />
<br />It was also quite a surprise to see you live on the other side of the pond too.

<br />That's only suitable for new NES-like PC homebrew though using CHR RAM. If you want to play other games you'd have to give it more RAM and a FPGA to cover CHR bankswitching unless the card can be written at a speed of 12KiB/Vblank to emulate bankswitching.
<br />
<br />The reason video card output isn't good is because it's generally scaled to 480 lines and interlaced. If you have/get a 15 kHz RGB display, try the ArcadeVGA which can actually output native game resolutions.

<br />A data rate of 12 KiB every 1/60 s is less than 1 MB per second, well under the limit of classic PCI or even USB. Yes, this assumes that VRAM is writable while rendering is on. That can be solved: steal a cycle from sprite processing like the GBA does.
<br />
<br />But seriously, ArcadeVGA is probably the way to go if you want to send 240p or 288p video to a CRT. Are there any cheap circuits for turning ArcadeVGA's RGB output into YPP ("component") output for TVs?

Another way may be to directly connect the RAM to the PC to write CHR RAM and VRAM and switch it back to the PPU for the rest. <br /><br />Is there a way for mid-frame bankswitching to be compensated for?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But seriously, ArcadeVGA is probably the way to go if you want to send 240p or 288p video to a CRT.

<br />The parts can come to under $20 not including shipping:

<br />
<br />To create the -5V a 7905 could be used. 
<br />
<br />Here's another circuit for reference:
