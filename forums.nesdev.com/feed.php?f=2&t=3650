Maybe the NMI just updates PPU, APU, and joypad status, while the main thread has 2-3 gameplay threads to be swapped with each other.  Framerate could alter between specific threads within the main thread instead of altering the framerate of the whole main thread.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3329">strangenesfreak</a> — Wed Oct 24, 2007 2:54 pm</p><hr />

You don't HAVE to do it, as the sprites will remain the same one frame to another as long as the screen is turned on so that the DRAM won't fade, and the scrolling won't budge if $2006 is not acceded during VBlank. However, if you want smooth animation on screen, you have update at least sprites and scrolling each frame. If the game slows down and you stop to update them, the screen won't mess up but the game will effectively slow down (no surprise).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Oct 24, 2007 1:10 pm</p><hr />

Most Konami games (probably all of them in fact) does everthing in the NMI routine. All 3 Final Fantasy games does everything in the Main thread and the NMI does nothing but return.

Most games will double a displayed frame if processing is taking too long. I'm assuming that after they finish processing, they poll a frame counter until it changes, then trigger a screen update. They have to do this since graphics updates are usually either done for a particular 1/60 second, or not done; they can't be delayed or half-done. Some games just give up and run in 30 FPS all the time, and suffer for it. One that comes to mind (with no excuse for running half rate) is Rambo.<br /><br />An interesting approach would be to dynamically adjust movement of some objects on screen, moving them smoothly if enough processor time is available, otherwise every other frame. I'm pretty sure Solomon's Key does this on rooms that have lots of enemies (without making player movement less-smooth). I posted a <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1292" class="postlink">multi-threading</a> demo a while back, which could be a basis for something like this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Tue Oct 23, 2007 5:28 pm</p><hr />

What would be a good method to incorporate framerate changes for "too long" frames, say, change the framerate from 60Hz to 30Hz when a frame of gameplay needs two frames?<br /><br />Would it be as simple as always running NMIs at 60Hz that update a frame counter, then during the second real frame of a gameplay frame, finish everything then don't do anything else until the next frame - like frameskip?<br /><br />Maybe one could run code in NMIs that will never use up a lot of time.
