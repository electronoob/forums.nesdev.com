What you do is overwrite data for screens you left behind with data for new screens, so the 3rd screen overwrites the first, the 4th overwrites the second, and so on (of course this can happen in the other direction as well, unless your game is like SMB1 and you can't scroll backwards).<br /><br />So, if you're decompressing collision data to ROM, the principle is the same. If you set aside enough memory to hold the collision data of 2 screens, once that memory is all used up you wrap back to the other end and start overwriting the data.<br /><br />You can often use the AND instruction to find out the corresponding places of game world coordinates in the name tables or collision tables in RAM. If you want to know where in the name tables to draw metatile column number 237 of your level, you just mask off the bits that are outside of the range of the name tables. If the metatiles are 16 pixels wide, you can have 32 columns of them in the 512x240-pixel space provided by the name tables. You need 5 bits to count from 0 to 31 (those are your 32 columns), so anything past the 5th bit should be masked off. Since 237 AND %00011111 = 13, you know that column 237 of your level map will be drawn at column 13 of the name tables. With a few more calculations you can even convert that into addresses you can write to $2006 for updating tiles/attributes (but that's outside of the scope of this message! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />).<br /><br />The exact same thing happens with with collision data you keep in RAM. If you've been progressively decompressing it there and overwriting the data you don't need anymore, you can be sure that masking off the unnecessary bits from the X coordinate relative to the game world will give you the correct coordinate for the data you're after in your RAM table.

I am assuming that you know that that works... tepples, Kasumi, tokumaru, thefox, Shiru have any of you successfully used a larger than 256 byte variable? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />   Was it fun? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Ok  I'm so looking forward to tomorrow figuring this out... must be up at 6:55am tomorrow.

So as a shortcut you can just do <strong>AND #%11110000</strong> instead of <strong>LSR LSR LSR LSR ASL ASL ASL ASL</strong>. It works the same. Stop thinking about math as you learned in school for a minute and try to see it as the 6502 sees it (which is much simpler than what you learned in school, IMO).</div><br /><br />Ok... now my row metatiles per row is 32... but <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">AND #11100000b</tt> isn't right because <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">LSR LSR LSR LSR ASL ASL ASL ASL ASL</tt> it wasn't shifted right <s>32</s> <span style="color: #FF0080">five</span> times.   I think <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">AND #11110000b ASL</tt> would be fine... right?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0080">edit.</span>

But you also have to take into consideration that the base unit is the type of element you are accessing, in this case, metatiles. If you have pixel coordinates, you have to first convert them to metatile coordinates, hence the need to divide both X and Y by the dimensions of your metatiles before applying that formula.<br /><br />Another thing that will affect how you apply the formula is how your levels are stored in RAM/ROM. If you store it screen by screen, then ElementsPerRow will always be the same, because the number of metatiles per screen doesn't change. If you don't divide your level in screens, then ElementsPerRow will be the length of the entire level, and it will vary from level to level. IMO, things are easier if you divide the levels into screens, because the metatile offsets will always fit in 8 bits, and the multiplications/divisions can be easily done with shifts.</div>Aaaahhhhh, yes now I understand what I'm doing wrong... there are 32 ElementsPerRow so I need to use 16 bits.  In your opinion things are easier if you divide the levels into screens, because the metatile offsets will always fit in 8 bits... and that makes sense!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I kindof agree right now, but now that I seem to know what to do to make 32 elements per row work I'm kind of excited too!!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" />  <strong><span style="color: #00FFFF"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Thank you tokumaru!!</span></span></strong>  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
