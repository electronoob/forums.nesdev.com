<br /><strong><em><br />1. When using the mapper do it write a new bank of code (.org $E000) above the NMI routine right under my $8000 bank.</em><br /></strong>
<br />2. What is this mean?

<br /><strong><em>3.  Since ill be switching to the next bank in my demo.  writing to these must done in nmi and with flag to swap back if i need to.  Right?<br /></em></strong>
<br />4.  i read somewhere that in this mapper reg 0 and 3 are used for the PRG
<br />while 1-2 are for CHR.  Is that true.  Should i use Reg 3 ($E000 - $FFFF) for my new bank to swap when needed?
<br />
<br /><strong>any help would rock thanks in advance.<br />el</strong>

<br />
<br />The NESASM directive to declare two 16k areas of PRG ROM is:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; .inesprg 2&nbsp; &nbsp;; 2x 16KB PRG code</div><br /><br />Then you can define the banks like so:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; .bank 0<br />&nbsp; .org $8000<br />&nbsp; .bank 1<br />&nbsp; .org $A000<br />&nbsp; .bank 2<br />&nbsp; .org $C000<br />&nbsp; .bank 3<br />&nbsp; .org $E000<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Sounds like you may just be going over the boundary from the $8000 8k bank to the $A000 bank. I think NESASM is just trying to squish it all into the 1 bank where you could actually just relocate some subroutines into the next bank (bank 1) and jump to them there.

<br />But for the lack of SRAM, I'd be using UNROM in my own project. And I'm sure that a lot of SNROM games might have been UNROM for the same reason, especially those that needed to save things.

<br />
<br />Pretty much and I agree on MMC3. If only the MMC3 didn't have a command register, and didn't have the retarded setup of 2 2K banks and 4 1K Banks. I mean seriously would it have killed them to make it 8 1k banks? 
<br />
<br />Mainly I don't like the MMC1's Shift register issue. Takes more cycles than I'd like, and more bytes of space than I'd like. If you're going to develop a game now, why limit yourself? Why not use the best thing you can get? Well, atleast something better than MMC1. I wouldn't advise scrapping MMC5 games unless you're going to make the most badass NES game to ever be created. :p

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />sweet.  you think its possible to use more than 8kb of memory.  i lookin for about a least 8 times this space.  would it be possible to link a 64k SRAM to the addressing pins of my PRG ROM and just transfer about less then for 4KB at a time to each bank at a a time (ie. $1000,$2000,$3000,ets.... ) to the SRAM using the OE CE and WE to bypass a write to the PRG ROM.  
<br />i thinking its possible using all A0-15 pins of PRG ROM.  i mean the WRAM on the MMC1 is tied to the addressing lines on the PRMROM and the NES.  so why not just tie them all and not just ones that decode 6000-7FFFF?

<br />MMC1 is the best thing you can reasonably get without sacrificing donor carts.  If you are just targeting emulators and maybe a couple repros instead of a full new game release, you could look at the VRC series.  Most (all?) of them use 1KB chr rom banks, have 8KB prg banks, irq, etc.  The FME7 chips also have similar specs without the different sized chr banks of the MMC3.
<br />
<br />So far MMC1 is even overkill for my game ideas.  UNROM seems to be my mapper of choice for size and manufacturing.

Takes more cycles than I'd like, and more bytes of space than I'd like.</div>I agree that it's a bit awkward, but the overhead it's not really noticeable unless you've got code and data stashed all over the place and need to swap in every other function. The benefits of MMC3's finer bank-switching granularity and raster IRQs are *far* larger, but if you don't need them then I'd go for the minimalistic setup whenever possible.
<br />
<br />Actually I've sped up my own MMC1 switching a bit by relying on the dummy writes of the RMW instructions. That is INC/DEC/ASL/LSR (and some of the illegals) first rewrite their original value before writing the new one which can be exploited by placing some strategic constants in the $E000-$FFFF range and working on it with the right instruction. The big drawback is that you can only write an even number of bits this way and the shift register needs to be fed five. If you can design your code to place two switches in a row then you can write six bits the first time around, thus latching in the first bit of the next bank as well, and only the last four the second time.
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;asl c00 ;; write %00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;dec c03 ;; write %01<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;inc c00 ;; write %10<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;lsr c03 ;; write %11<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*= $e000<br />c00&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte %00000000<br />c03&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte %00000011</div>
<br />This amounts to 18 cycles per switch with a LDA #/STA pair for the final bit, or 15 cycles on average if you can combine two switches. Naturally you'd want hide away this entire mess into some nice macros in any case.
