VirtualDub has a way to auto-concatenate a stream of sequentially named images, so you don't even have to funnel it into an AVI stream yourself or anything (though that itself can be pretty easy too, e.g. Windows' crusty VFW API).

Moreover, this was a PC monitor, no idea how different are TVs in that sense.<br /><br />Make what you want out of that, but basically trails shouldn't last longer than a handful of frames at most.

This means that the correct constant (with this TV) for the expression I gave above is k=1/13. This is low enough that on the NES, the effect will only ever be visible when transitioning to black pixels. So here's an animated gif, simulating same:<div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

	</div>It's <em>really</em> subtle, especially without any of the phosphor size blur. You'll also want to enlarge it; I can't see anything when it's at 100dpi.<br /><br />And after manually capturing 17 frames from FCEUX, here's how I processed it:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">for i in `seq 0 16`; do <br />&nbsp;pnmarith -maximum $i.ppm previous.ppm &gt; n$i.ppm;<br />&nbsp;ppmtogif n$i.ppm &gt; n$i.gif;<br />&nbsp;pnmgamma -ungamma 2.2 n$i.ppm | ppmdim .077 | pnmgamma 2.2 &gt; previous.ppm;<br />done<br />pnmcat -tb n*.ppm | ppmtogif &gt; all.gif<br />gifsicle --use-colormap all.gif -O3 -V -o anim.gif -d2 n{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16}.gif</div> Note that I'm fixing up the gamma; if I hadn't, it'd be even harder to see.<br /><br />I suspect that standard 24-bit displays are not actually deep enough to show this in a compelling way; after two refreshes (1/13)² even full scale content is just 1 LSB.
