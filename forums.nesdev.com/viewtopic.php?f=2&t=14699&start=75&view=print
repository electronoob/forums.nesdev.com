		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Having worked closely with a textile industry museum, i get horrified by the amount of t-shirts getting produced, how many tonnes of t-shirts are thrown away, and how many there are in the average wardrobe. The social and environmental aspects aren't pretty to look at. When youtubers sell their promotional stuff, i cringe. That said, a nesdev tshirt/piqu√© isn't quite like a company/event/promotional tshirt. It'd be a small run, and i'd wear it for as long as the fabric holds. Better have a good look at materials, quality and production, though. I don't mind paying for something that'll last.

And I don't know why it's so convenient to offer t-shirt, if they did the same for all kind of clothes with an equal frequency and not just t-shirts it'd be much more useful. For example these days raincoat would be more useful than yet another tshirt.

It seems every five seconds I hear people competing for how Nerdy they are because they watch Game of Thrones or whatever.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />
