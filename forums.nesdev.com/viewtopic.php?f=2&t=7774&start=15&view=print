<br />I think you'll find that on every platform, not just the NES. Every team-based game development effort I have been a part of has had two fracture points:
<br />
<br />1. The coders spend most of their time going in circles over the "architecture".
<br />2. The artists get bored and wander off.

<br />
<br />Nice to see someone's putting together that all in one IDE/debugger. I hope they see it through to completion!
<br />
<br />Yeah you really have to enjoy the business side or at least be able to suck it up because it takes a lot away from the actual development unless you have someone else doing it. I often think about how much more impressive RCR would be had I been able to spend all that time on polish/development. Without the biz though it wouldn't be on track for the console releases nor would there be all the awareness/anticipation.
<br />
<br />qbradq: It's true. building a team is very very difficult because few people have the drive to see things through. Every contractor I dealt with or tried to work with started off on the same page "this is the greatest project ever! I'd be on my deathbed and still working on it! Then a week later they're no where to be found. The worst were the few that were lazy, late and greedy all at the same time. The importance of setting up proper contracts and delivery guidelines are critical. In some cases they wouldn't perform to even a sufficient level despite their apparent qualifications. It's been a horror story trying to get help, but I'm not alone, happens to everyone. I'm lucky I'm not in the position of some friends of mine running larger studios where shoddy contractors/employees end up losing them hundreds of thousands or more. I'm lucky I was able to find some awesome audio guys and an awesome artist in the end to help out.
<br />
<br />tepples: I recommend anyone unable to move near game development studios to then start making/shipping their own games, whether it be iOS or PC. If PC, push hard to get it into Steam, because that's getting towards the prestige of consoles and will impress the console makers. The important thing is shipping. If you can show them that you've shipped games they will take you more seriously. Risk is their #1 concern, and if you prove that you've seen projects through to completion that puts them at ease. You can also look into doing contract work remotely for other game studios, although it'll be far harder to do that for anyone other than PC developers and most want you to be on site even if a contractor.
<br />
<br />3gengames: By industry experience I mean working for a game studio developing games. BTW, XNA is neat but unless you rip off minecraft (which you shouldn't do) you're not going to be able to quit your day job on XBLIG. WinPhone7 is also a tiny market. Thing is, these markets are so small, if you're going to spend all that time making a great game, you're better off targeting Steam or such. Making a portable game and releasing it on multiple platforms is always the best, but by developing in XNA you're really limiting your ability to do that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, it's been echoed in this forum a few months ago that XNA is just a toy compared to real stuff. PC development would be something within my relm I should look into more, maybe get away from the NES for a while. Although I feel a lot more at home doing HTML5 and Javascript, so maybe a web game would be nicer to work on.
<br />
<br />And yeah, that minecraft clone is terrible. And the good games there are pretty much the only ones with a good idea that is well implemented, so it's more of a matter of a good idea XNA can do good. Miner Dig Deep is one I love, and possibly look at even trying on the NES, which would be cool but probably too much.
<br />
<br />Never really had true info about the game development industry or from anyone [About to be, more so.] in it, very cool. Thanks for taking the time to come back here and not forget us....err, everyone else who was here. Gives us all hope inside I think. If you can do it, it shows it's possible. Just gotta have the drive as you said to get it done. Very uplifting and cool. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />one question about the console ports: is your game being emulated on consoles or how did you port it over?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's not emulated, although the core engine (primarily graphics) was built like an emulator. Basically instead of emulating 6502 it ran native code (written in C) which poked at the graphics engine to change the tiles/pals/sprites/etc. When I first started the non-NES version I was writing it in such as way that I could've ported it back to the NES by translating the C to ASM when the project was done.
<br />
<br />Eventually though gameplay took the focus, as making a fun game for the masses is more important than achieving a technical feat if you're going to invest as much time and money as I have into the project.
<br />
<br />I eventually had to take some liberties, primarily because of localization. Things like leaderboards just don't display nicely with 8x8 tiles (not enough room for rank+gamertag+entries) and certain languages have excessively long words. As a result, I had to add a variable size font layer over top, but unlike the horrendous Mega Man 9, it still looks authentic unless you're paying attention to the tile grid for fonts.
<br />
<br />The engine itself enforces the NES limitations and doesn't even let me render stuff at a higher resolution or such. I did get flexible though on the sprite limits and number of sounds playing simultaneously for gameplay reasons. It also still has the proper NES palette fading, etc. (again, unlike MM9).
<br />
<br />I also ended up transitioning the C over to C++ as it's a lot better language/more structured/cleaner.
<br />
<br />Despite these liberties, none of the other NES-style games that've come out for XBLA/WW/DSiWare/etc. enforce the limitations as much as RCR does.

<br />That's not really a liberty in my opinion, unless perhaps you're talking about MMC5's lack of support for CHR RAM. Compare an <a href="http://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=File:Lorem_ipsum_NES_VWF.png" class="postlink">actual NES screenshot</a>.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Your open source work would get you a gig at a game company (heck, I got my initial job in the industry because of all the free software/game stuff I'd been developing). Only hitch is that most devs (at least console devs) now expect all programmers to have 3D math skills, etc. for most positions, but you can get into working on frontends/UI/etc. first if you don't have that. It's funny because 70% of the work on these games really doesn't require you to know all that stuff, but AAA devs at least expect it.
<br />
<br />The open source stuff likely won't get you a dev license with Nintendo though. Sony on the other hand is great to work with an you may be able to get a PSPminis license, a program they opened up to help out smaller developers and not make them jump through so many hoops. The only thing required to ship a PSPmini game is to buy the devkit and get an ESRB rating. The rating's about $500 now for downloadables (used to be far far more, but they've finally smartened up). Worldwide ratings would cost you a lot more though. 
<br />
<br />Running even a 1 man studio is tons of work though, so I recommend everyone work for another studio until they feel ready to go on their own. The amount I learned at other studios was critical. I really would've have been able to get where I am today without the experience (even if I somehow did get the console licenses). All the stuff I didn't know I needed to learn like the production process, working with artists, etc. --I had no idea how much more there was to it than me just sitting in a chair and coding. Each console also has a thick BOOK on all the little certification requirements and these can take a month alone to code (ie. must display EXACTLY the correct message when saving a game, must display for N seconds, what happens if they pull out the card before, during, after, what happens if someone tries to start the game with controller #2, HUNDREDS of these things --for each console). It's a lot more relaxing to be able to go home at 5 without the weight of everything on your shoulders. This thing's a 7 day a week job and I haven't had a vacation in years (all my money goes towards keeping afloat until this thing ships, even had to cash in my retirement savings and have a mortgage on the line).
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Cool, nice demo! I had actually avoided simulating CHR RAM until recently due to character customization. The pedestrian CHR are generated from pieces (heads, bodies, colour mapping) and I used to do this in the pipeline. However, since I added character customization (the character can select something like 80 different heads) I needed to make it dynamic (wasteful to store every animation pre-generated for every combination).
<br />
<br />I also simulate a small bankswitched area of the BG CHR for water, etc. This would've been a pretty sweet mapper lol.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Very cool info. And open source work will possibly get you a small job? That's good to know it's not too hard to at least get into somewhere. And how it still semi-emulates the sprites and stuff is awesome. I'll have to replay Megaman 9 though and see what it looks like, I thought it was awesome looking. Even for maybe going with too many colors and small details like that, I think that game was a great idea at least. The demo was awesome.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Many companies will relocate you (even fly you down for an interview), but it's most likely if you've been in the industry for a while. I was lucky in that when I started, I got a job working on those Jakks TV Games systems which was very much like an NES/Genesis so my skills at the time were very applicable. Following that I worked on PS2 Genesis emulations then PSP Arcade emulations then worked up to original titles like Sonic Rivals for PSP. They company was in town though, also fortunately.
<br />
<br />You've got the skills to get a job in the industry. Just certain positions like gameplay programmer on a AAA game will probably be harder to nail without further industry experience.
<br />
<br />tpr is the right site. Probably just down because of the PSN issues right now. It's very easy to port stuff to the PSP though so if you did plan on doing a PSPmini game, you can just work on something with the same screen res until it's back up. I'm not sure how PSPminis sales are though. In this day and age you generally want to hit as many platforms as possible and make your code/art portables/scaleable.
<br />
<br />Haven't seen the Mac guidelines but it's about a month of work first time through. In addition to all the proper messages, controller states, etc. (ie. on Xbox you need to support goofy things like the "Big Button Pad" as well as the controller and remote for at least the core operations), you also need to make your code somewhat asynchronous for cases such as writing to the leaderboards and waiting for it to complete. 
<br />
<br />Starting a company, developing a game, handling all the cert requirements, game ratings, marketing, etc. is a lot to bite off at once without a team and some prior experience. You can do it, but just a fair warning not to underestimate it all.
