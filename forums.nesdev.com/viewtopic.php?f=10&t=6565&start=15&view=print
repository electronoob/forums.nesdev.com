<br />It's kinda like that. In order to run programs, some old computers (and all new ones BTW) first copied ("loaded") the code to RAM and then executed it from there. But the NES was a simpler machine, with only 2KB RAM, so it ran code straight from ROM.
<br />
<br />Any CPU needs to be connected to some memory, from where it will run programs from. This memory can be RAM, ROM or both. The NES CPU is connected to a RAM chip (visible at $0000-$07FF and mirrored a few times after that) and a ROM chip on the cartridge (visible at $8000-$FFFF).

<br />
<br />Oh, so OAM memory is not physically located in the CPU Memory?  And I need to create a separate memory variable like memOAM[256]?

This doesn't make any sense - the CPU is a chip that fetches instructions from other memory chips (internal RAM, SRAM, PRG-ROM). There is no memory in the CPU, there is just several registers.
<br />I'll make a table to make things hopefully clearer :

<br />but it will execute MUCH faster, as the CPU will "skip" all fetches, so it will just read, write and repeat 256 times (and somehow an extra cycle is added, that's where the 513 cycle number is from).

<br />Come on Bregalad, we have always used the terms "CPU memory" to talk about the memory that the CPU sees and "PPU memory" to talk about the memory that the PPU sees. We also talk about "palette memory" and such, because they are separate memories. We could also use WRAM and VRAM, but we must be able to identify them as separate memories.

<br />
<br />So, given your example, the address found in $2003 (not shown, but assumed) would be that of the OAM which is located in the PPU?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, exactly. However - I'm not exactly sure about $2003. $2003 and $2004 are somewhat obscure registers. Most games write just $00 to it before writing to $4014, and some (Final Fantasy) don't ever write anything there. Yet all sprites always show up correctly, so I guess $2003 is "zeroed" automatically at reset or something. So I'm not too sure about it in fact.

<br />No - not really. Memory that is on the CPU bus isn't CPU memory to me.
<br />
<br />If the whole CPU and PPU adress ranges pointed to a single area of shared memory (like it's the case for the C64) then I'd be okay for it - but the NES is different. For example, if $4136 is open bus, it's not a part of CPU memory, because there is no memory. So it's important to specify which memory you're talking about, not just which chip's bus it's wired to.

<br />
<br />Hmm, that is very odd.  I did just read in Marat Fayzullin's document about the Sprite RAM being separated from the CPU and PPU memory.  Anyway, thank you both for your help.  I'll leave you guys alone for a while.  I don't mean to be a bother.  I'm annoying even myself at this point.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Noah's Ark reads from SRAM ($7F00) for sprite DMA.
<br />
<br />(Sorry for resurrecting the old thread, but I just fixed this bug in my emulator. This post might be useful for other emu authors trying to find out why sprites aren't working in this game.)
