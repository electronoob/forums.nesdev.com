		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi. I know this is going to be a flaming thread, and I apologies in advance.
<br />
<br />Facts :
<br />- People comes very regularly to the Nesdev formus creating a new account for the sole purpose to ask how they make a booleg of their faviouite NES or even SNES game
<br />You see a DAMN LOT of threads like "hello I'm a total noob but I want to make myself a *** cartridge, how do I do that ?" such as <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7149" class="postlink">this</a>.
<br />
<br />- Those people usually leave as soon as they got their answer, and have no apparent interest in NESdev altogether - all they want is a copy of a cart either to sell it or to play it
<br />
<br />- They don't even "make it belive" they want to do a dev-cart
<br />
<br />- All info for making bootlegs is already widely available arround (such as the Nesdev main page and Nesdev wiki)
<br />
<br />- If they want to play their game and care about legality they could buy the game instead
<br />
<br />- If they want to play the game and don't care about legality they could just play the ROM instead
<br />
<br />- If they want to paly it on real HW at all prices, a powepak is about the same price as an EPROM programmer, but much more user friendly.
<br />
<br />- There is a rule on all emulation-based forums that nobody can ask for ROMs or they will get locked threads/warned/banned.
<br />
<br />-&gt; I see no reason asking for bootlegs should be tolerated when asking for ROMs isn't. It's pretty much the same thing (getting a copy of a game you didn't own) exept that in the bootleg's case they are able to sell it (not that they will, but they *could*), while nobody risks to sell a ROM. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Therefore I propose a poll, if we should introduce a rule that people who ask for bootlegs will see their topic locked and will be warned, like people who would ask for ROMs. Of course this don't apply to people who ask to modify carts to run their own programs.

It's like with people writing emulators, first trying to get their favorite games working, then becoming interested in accuracy for its own sake. Do you have links to more threads from the past showing that people asking for this information are just a drain on this board? Even if they are, locking and banning people might have unintended side-effects that are worse than those of these people being allowed to post and get replies. I just don't see a big problem, and would like some evidence.

Playing the ROM does have some drawbacks. For one thing, most PCs that I've seen don't have a composite video output, unlike an NES or a modded Wii, and most people aren't 1. aware of Sewell Direct's VGA to SDTV converter or 2. <a href="http://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=HTPCs_are_for_geeks" class="postlink">willing to put a PC behind the TV</a>.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">- If they want to paly it on real HW at all prices, a powepak is about the same price as an EPROM programmer, but much more user friendly.</div><br />As I understand it, PowerPak support for more obscure mappers is still iffy. The topic you linked refers to <em>Castlevania</em> series games, and any hack based on <em>Dracula's Curse</em> will need MMC5 support. Even some widely distributed versions of MMC3 for PowerPak have problems where PRG ROM bankswitching registers also control PRG RAM, visible in M.C. Kids and Crystalis.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">- There is a rule on all emulation-based forums that nobody can ask for ROMs or they will get locked threads/warned/banned.</div><br />The rules in effect on Nesdev.com currently include the <a href="http://www.parodius.com/policies/" class="postlink">Parodius.com AUP</a>.

<br />But at what point do we draw the line between "their own programs" and a bootleg? Total conversion hacks of commercial games? Homebrew games using commercial game sprites as placeholders?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've thought more about this, and banning/locking is a drastic approach that should only be used when the person/thread is a significant threat/drain. Using those tools for anything less means everyone is a potential target, which is clearly harmful to a board. Misuse of admin power due to personal distaste for some topics is unhealthy to discussion. Links to ROMs, trolling that starts big flame threads or unrest, or repeated postings that nobody is interested in might qualify for banning/locking. But asking for help with putting EPROMs in a cartridge? That's on-topic. If there are too many people asking, it's a sign that documentation of how to do so needs to be improved, not that threads need to be locked/people banned.

<br />
<br />You just can't treat all cases the same, because while trying to avoid the people who are trying to make money out of what's not theirs you also get rid of a lot of honest people.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Nothing against him, but the guy who asked how to make a repro with some famicom cart or something had it for sale on NA. I'd feel better if he'd of kept that one to learn and made another, but I doubt that happened. I learned about making repro's and stuff via posting a topic. It made it alot easier, since there's not one guide that brings everything together in one place easily. Once you learn, sure, make them all you want, I'd like people to make at least keep a couple before I'd buy a repro off somebody, too. Do it for yourself first with a game you want and will keep.Then maybe do it for money later if you want a reason to keep doing it since you find some fun in it. (Like me, but I don't make repro's, just more devcarts) Experience also gives a better quality repro. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />
<br />And if we had more information for repro's and making them that WASN'T the forums and was easy to find, maybe it'd help. If I can, in my free time, I'll put a guide together to finding donor carts, how to make them take EPROM's, etc. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I'd also give it to you guys to add more and take away as you wish. A wiki of sorts. Just a webpage though. I think that'd be nice. Shouldn't be too hard to explain why you need different carts, how the chips inside are different, and stuff. Just getting it all thogether might be a tad hard.

Especially because those of us who have been here the longest, have answered these same kind of threads dozens of times before, and it can get tiresome.
<br />
<br />I don't care if people make their own carts or whatever, whatever they do is their own problem.  Even if people want to sell them, it's best to try to not be judgmental of anyone because of it.  In a sense, they're meeting a market demand that no one else will fulfill.  In the same way it doesn't make much sense to get shitty at buyers for buying something in the only way it is available..
<br />
<br />If a rule like this was enforced, it would only be fair to also ban most discussion of the PowerPak (PiratePak).  I seriously can't believe someone would use that exclusively for homebrew development (swapping CF cards is no more convenient than swapping socketed FlashROM, except that it's easier to set up the first time), and clearly it was designed to be the ultimate user-configurable bootleg multicart.  As much as I complain about the PowerPak's faults and shortcomings, I have one and I like it for what it is.
<br />
<br />I noticed too that RetroUSB recently moved their bootleg carts and homebrew carts into separate categories.  That makes things at least <em>look</em> less shady.  I know myself, I'm biased towards self-publishing for many reasons, but there is just no way I would have a game of mine released there to be produced and sold alongside bootlegs.  But at the same time, my own standard is something that I can only hold myself to, and I can't fault anyone else for doing something they believe in.

<br />Walmart* carries CF writers but not DIP flash writers. And you don't need to take that bar off your front-loading NES's cartridge slot. And you don't need to rewire.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah that's pretty much what I meant by it being easier to set up the first time.  Instead of using a screw driver to remove socketed chips, use 2 stacked sockets - it gets a good connection but can pop out with less force than a CF card.
<br />
<br />For a front-loader, you can put the cart in first, then put the ROMs in afterwards, and not have to remove the cart from the NES.  But a toploader is easier all around, with a bare PCB.

<br />I kinda do. My CF card has only a dozen or so pirated games, which I don't ever play. 99% of the times I use my PowerPak it's for development purposes. It's still easier than swapping FlashROMs and using my EPROM programmer. I do believe I'm an exception among PowerPak users though.

<br />Likewise here. My cousin, on the other hand, uses his PowerPak mostly for running ROM hacks and a few (J)-only games like Gimmick and Cocoron.

<br />
<br />Now, I'm not judging anyone, but it seems that Bregalad opposes to anything that results in a person making money using knowledge acquired in these boards, like Sivak asking for ideas for his next commercial game.
<br />
<br />To me, the NES has always been a hobby, and at first it may look wrong that people are making money from it, but it shouldn't be wrong if the person has actually worked hard for that money. Sivak has put a lot of effort in his games, it's not like someone here gave him the entire source code and he just compiled and claimed it was his. Making a full game is a lot of work, and he probably deserves his compensation if others will benefit from the final product.
<br />
<br />I do notice that Sivak doesn't give much back to the community though, as I rarely (never?) see him helping others with the knowledge he has, he mostly shows up to ask questions for his own stuff, or to promote said stuff. Since his games aren't free, the least he could offer is free knowledge to newbies, like he got from us.
<br />
<br />As for bootlegs, like it's been said, there is a market. If there are people willing to pay for such products, that means they are not capable (or willing) to make these carts themselves, and it's good that someone else is selling what they want to have. No harm done if both parties are happy, I guess. A big problem would be people selling these repros as something they are not, like rare prototypes or something, there is no excuse for that.
