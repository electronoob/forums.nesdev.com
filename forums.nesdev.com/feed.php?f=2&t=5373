Yeah, this is pretty cool to see what people are doing. Unfortunately my site is under "inactive construction". By that I mean like when a street is under construction, but everyone's gone home for the day and there are still a bunch of cones and machines sitting there (and it's a huge mess). I was amidst redoing my site to look nice and be up-to-date when I got lazy and stopped, after I'd deleted pretty much everything so I could start from scratch <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.<br /><br />And as for attributes... I don't want to write an article about them! I hate them so much it makes me want to die. They have been the reason behind so many scrapped projects. The worst was an all-directional scroller I made that had these annoying, random attribute glitches that I could never figure out. If it weren't for that one little 4x2 attribute chunk on the bottom... They are definitely the hardest thing to deal with in NES programming, I think.<br /><br />I'm currently working on a platformer too. Perhaps I'll get the time to get my site back up so I can post more information about it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Wed Jul 08, 2009 10:42 am</p><hr />

That's pretty cool, MetalSlime. Subscribed to the RSS feed as well.<br />I'll be closely following the development, it's a pretty interesting read so far.<br />Attribute nightmare, hehe. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I've started blogging about my project, too, but for the reasons Banshaku mentioned I refrained from telling people about it. Not as in-depth as MetalSlime's and not as frequently updated either, but here it is in case anyone is interested: <a href="http://morphcat.de/blog/" class="postlink">http://morphcat.de/blog/</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1377">miau</a> — Wed Jul 08, 2009 8:58 am</p><hr />

Thanks for the support <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.  It's been a lot of fun writing posts for the blog (I got the itch after writing some wiki articles).  It keeps me thinking about my game too, which has motivated me to code more often actually.  Btw, <a href="http://www.tummaigames.com/blog/2009/07/08/explorer-3-room-data/" class="postlink">wrote up a new post today</a>.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">ZomCoder wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />maybe more of us should create blogs...there seems to be a lot of development going on here but not very much show &amp; tell as it were. It'd be fun to see what more people were working on.<br /></div><br /><br />I'd love to read about other peoples' nesdev projects too.  Of course I read about them a lot in these forums, but they are more Q&amp;A rather than logs.  I've always wanted to see somebody's thought process making a game from start to finish.<br /><br />Btw, if you were thinking about starting a blog, I'll definitely read it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Banshaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Maybe people don't want to talk about it because they're not ready yet to show it. ...

Tons of people announced large and ambitious projects and screenshots and blog like things and then very few of them got done (none that I can even remember)....not pretty.
