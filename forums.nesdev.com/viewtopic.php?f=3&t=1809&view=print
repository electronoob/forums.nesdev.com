		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is a spinoff of what was starting to be discussed in <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1807" class="postlink">this thread</a>.
<br />
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">The general idea:</span>
<br />
<br />To update the iNES format and create an auditing utility to solve various iNES ambiguities, and to correct common iNES header screw-ups (I can't tell you how many games are headered wrong).  All while retaining backwards compatibility with prior versions of iNES.
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Why not just go with UNIF?:</span>
<br />
<br />The obvious question.  Since UNIF ROMs are pretty much all labelled properly, and leave nothing to question... why bother with updating iNES?  Why not just go with UNIF?
<br />
<br />UNIF has some difficulties which prevent it from (ever?) becoming a full replacement to iNES:
<br />
<br />- UNIF board name list is incomplete.  While it's true that most US releases have a proper UNIF dump, many foreign games, and some rare games do not.  Therefore an iNES-&gt;UNIF converter won't be able to convert every ROM... making iNES a remaining necessity
<br />
<br />- ROM hackers and translators use iNES pretty much exclusively.  Even if UNIF were a full replacement, its floating block format is incompatible with IPS (another depricated, yet widely popular format).  In addition, every NES ROM editor on the planet is built to work with iNES roms.  I'm not aware of any that have UNIF support.  So unless every hack, translation, and ROM hacking utility are updated to work with UNIF, there will be a large portion of the emulation community who will refuse to switch.
<br />
<br />- Many ROM sites distribute iNES, but not UNIF.  Some of the more "major" ROM sites even keep current with GoodNES sets.  If we can just take over the next GoodNES release from Cowering, there's a good chance the new ROMs will get injected into the emulation community and begin circulating.  UNIF, which has already been around a while, still hasn't really got anywhere.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">What do we want out of the updated format:</span>
<br />
<br />Blargg brought up a very good point in that other thread:
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The most important thing is to limit the scope of what is being attempted. As I understand it, the goal is to remove the ambiguity in specifying which mapper is being used (and possibly some extra hardware). Attempting to throw in a kitchen sink would definitely ruin the effort.</div>
<br />
<br />I couldn't have said it better myself.  UNIF aready does the job of ironing out every tiny thing you can think of.  All we're trying to do here is get the ROMs playable <em>without</em> game specific hacks or runtime CRC checks.
<br />
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">What this thread is to accomplish:</span>
<br />
<br />I'd really like to outline ideas on what you think will be the best way to approach this.  We're stuck with a 16 byte header, of which several bytes are already used.
<br />
<br />The things we need to do with this format are:
<br />
<br />1)  Create something like a "sub-mapper" number which differentiates incompatible mappers which share the same mapper number.  For example, MMC3 might be 004:0, while MMC6 might be 004:1  (aaa:b, a = mapper number, b = mapper sub).  Most 071 games might be 071:0, and Fire Hawk (1-screen) might be 071:1.
<br />
<br />2)  Actually get things headered right.  Fix ALL the damn mirror mode errors present in 30% of the iNES ROMs floating out there.  Remove that DiskDude crap, etc.
<br />
<br />3)  Actually get a space which tells on-cartridge WRAM and CHR-RAM sizes.  None of that "0 defaults to 8k" stuff that's in iNES.
<br />
<br />4)  Reliable NTSC/PAL/Dual value
<br />
<br />5)  Perhaps a "Bus Conflicts" flag like the one in the 'unofficial' update listed on the wiki?
<br />
<br />
<br />That's pretty much all I can think of that the new format should cover.  If iNES did all that I'd be perfectly satisfied with it.
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">But that's not all:</span>
<br />
<br />A new format is useless unless we have everything organized!  We can shoot the breeze and talk about how awesome this would be all day, but that wouldn't change anything.  SO -- in addition to outlining a new format... we need to do the following:
<br />
<br />
<br />1)  Outline <span style="text-decoration: underline">DETAILS</span> of the mapper number for <span style="text-decoration: underline">every known ROM dump out there</span>, and assign a mapper number:sub for <span style="text-decoration: underline">each and every one of them</span>.  This is where UNIF falls short in a big way, and if this format update is to have any snowball's chance in hell of working, this is really where we need to have a jump on.  If we just slap together something vague, we'll just be back here again in a few months with all the same problems (assuming the format even got anywhere).
<br />
<br />2)  Get these mapper numbers documented!  This probably even has to be done before #1.  Register descriptions, differences in sub mapper numbers, etc all has to be layed out clear as day.  There HAS to be an official list of mapper numbers, and it HAS to keep current.  This is where iNES went to hell, and we have to stay ahead of something like that happening again in the future.
<br />
<br />3)  All ROMs in the new format should be properly headered.  There's no excuse... I don't know how iNES went to hell... but that is really unacceptable.
<br />
<br />4)  <strong>WE NEED AN AUDITOR WHICH WILL CONVERT ROMS AND UPDATE HEADERS</strong>.  Without one, this project is a pipedream at best.  I'd like to say I'd be willing to write one if I could get a list of CRCs for ROM dumps, but my job is keeping me pretty busy so I doubt I'll be able to.  But if we can't get someone to write an auditor we might as well just stop now before we waste our time.
<br />
<br />5)  We need to get in touch with Cowering and tell him to either stop updating GoodNES, or hand off GoodNES to us so that his work doesn't conflict with ours.  But of course before we ask him to do either we'll have to have our shit together.
<br />
<br />
<br />That's about all I have on the subject.  I'm too lazy to come up with a propsed new header format right now, but I might later once more ideas are on the table.  What do you guys think?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As Disch said, iNES is established, so improvements to it are much more likely to be successful than replacements. I don't know about all the esoteric mapper issues and how complex they are, but in my mind iNES is close enough to being sufficient that a replacement would have to dead-simple to handle otherwise it wouldn't be able to justify itself.
<br />
<br />If this were carried out successfully, the current special case code in emulators would move to the iNES header upgrade tool ("auditor") and the emulator would then rely on the iNES header for unambiguously specifying the cartridge hardware. The additonal bits in the header should be defined in a way that minimizes the changes during updating, in most cases requiring no changes to the header. So in the MMC3/MMC6 case, an extra flag could be added that caused mapper 3 to be treated as MMC6. This seems preferable to defining a new mapper number, because it makes keeps the file usable in current emulators.

<br />
<br />Exactly what board names would you assign for unlicensed games which <em>don't actually have meaningful labels</em> on the cartridge PCBs? Acclaim boards and custom-made Konami PCBs have fun "names" such as 351258, 351298, 351908, 352026, 51555, 53361, 54425, 55741, 56504, and many Famicom cartridge PCBs don't have <strong>any board names at all</strong>. This is what doomed UNIF to failure.

<br />
<br />Yes, this is one of the biggest problems. A lot of the UNIF board names just get "made up", especially pirates and the like.
<br />
<br />This is a little OT, but I have been assigning the same names that Kevin Horton made up for non-standard boards.  Often he assigned unlicensed boards like "UNL-CompanyAbbrBoardName" like UNL-TEN800032 for a Tengen 800032 board.
<br />
<br />Rather than prefixing with UNL, what do you think of prefixing it with a company abbreviation instead? For example:
<br />
<br />TEN-800032
<br />AVE-NINA-06
<br />CAM-BF9093 (actually Camerica boards are labelled BIC-xx, but as stated above, that is insufficient)
<br />
<br />You could do this for the funky Konami and Acclaim boards too:
<br />KON-351908
<br />ACC-55741
<br />
<br />I don't really think it's all that neccessary to always stick to board names. For instance, Color Dreams/Wisdom Tree/AGCI/etc. have many boards, all with odd names or no names at all, but the differences all have to do with lockout-defeat methods. So rather than having to support 10 different Color Dreams boards, you could just use CDR-LS377 instead.
<br />
<br />Ideally this sort of thing should be discussed before just winging it and slapping whatever name in there. That's pretty much the same as just going ahead an assigning something to an "unused" mapper number.

<br />Since most people does think iNES work fine, and most people already have iNES roms on their PC, most people will just not care about the format, because most people are pissed about the SRAM sizes, CHR sizes, bus conflicts and whatever since their favourite games works.

<br />You won't be able to tell to everyone "delete all your ROMs and download new ones, those have a fixed header system". They won't follow you.
<br />
<br />Also, to fix every ROM out there, that'd be a lot of work. There is a long official list of licenced NES games in america, but I found none for Europe or Japan, and I think there is hundreds of FC only games that are small, rare and totally unknown, especially if their title is in japaneese.
<br />Pirate games are even more unorganized than licenced games, so the only real purpose of this would be homebrew devloppement ?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Fixing hacker memory maps in ROMs so emulators don't have to rely on CRC databases is a respectable goal, but rather unrealistic.
<br />Have you considered ever consolodating an online CRC32+MD5+SHA-1 database for all games that can be downloaded in several formats and with tools and libraries in multiple languages (c, c++, vb, etc) for calculating the checksums and selecting the appropriate game? Since this is predominantly an emulator problem and not a user problem, you're likely to make a lot more progress this way.
<br />Then if all of the top emulators were to start throwing out warning messages when a game doesn't match up in the CRC database, this would encourage fan translators and hackers to start using a new header system that bypasses the need for a CRC lookup.
<br />I'm hesitant to make a database that includes CRCs for translations, as that will only lead to hacks being included pre-patched at ROM sites lacking any and all readmes that came with the original work, a method most ROM hackers do not want their work distributed. The ROM sites can still go out of their way to acquire these unofficial works and include them with the "hacker headers", but at least the indexing project is no longer taking a direct role in promoting the behavior.

But of course before we ask him to do either we'll have to have our shit together.</div><br /><br />Perhaps we're speaking of a different Cowering, but if it's the same one who wouldn't remove a single translation I was responsible for from his piracy database: you stand a snowball's chance in hell of convincing him to step down from an entire system because you have a slightly updated header format. However, I can't say I directly know him so maybe you really can convince him to do this. If so, I wish you luck. One less GoodTool is a GoodDay indeed for emulation.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Not if their favourite emulator suddenly 'stops working'.

<br />
<br />With how many popular NES emulators there are, do you think you could get at least an 80% majority to outright block an old format from playing at all? If you have less than that, you'll only make another emulator more popular. Remember, end users don't care about accuracy or quality, so long as their favorite ten popular games "look" right and run full speed on their ten year old computers.
<br />If you can get an alliance to do this, then you have your best chance of getting everyone to upgrade their ROM headers right there. But remember, any emulator that pops up and doesn't block these games will suddenly have a desirable end-user feature your emulator doesn't. And I would suspect open source emulators would end up with "patched" binaries floating around that bypass the block.

The current romset (GoodNES 2.01) would work as well as it does now on Nintendulator; an emulator without a built-in database or header corrections. Games with bogus headers, or games like Startropics wouldn't. 80% is too much (people still use the inactive NESticle and FCEU), but if Marty of Nestopia joins in, which I think is currently the most popular active NES emulator, it could succeed.

<br />Excluding PD programs entirely would mean that you're including only pirated programs, which might get the developers indicted for "inducing" piracy. My policy is include those that work on NES hardware and exclude those that don't. For instance, include Tetramino but exclude GNOME vs. KDE and Mouser. But at least PD programs can display a URL of the manual.

<br />Nope. They'll keep the old version of their emulator on their PC with old ROMs, and say the last version of the emulator suck. A few of them will complain to the author, and he will additionnally recive lot of messages that are annoying to him

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i think if by adding more to the ines file format will just add to the mess that it is now.  i am not familiar with the famicom games, but if they dont have a board number, then perhaps bump the unif version and add a section MMC, where that could state the mmc controller used in the event the board name will not work.
<br />
<br />or, if you must add to the ines format, put unif chunks at the end of the file.  either check to see if there is data at the end or use one of the unused bits in the ines header indicating unif chunks are at the end.
<br />
<br />actually both these methods might work.
