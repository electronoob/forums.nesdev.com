		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Before I even start, I should say I already PM'd the creator of this hack about this, but figured others might have some valuable input as well.<br /><br />I have a Famicom Power glove that is going into an NES that is modded to have a Famicom EXP port. The Power glove works fine with every game I try except for Super Glove Ball, which being a US release, did not have support for the Famicom EXP port. I have modified the ROM to allow the Famicom EXP port to be used and it works off of my Everdrive now with the glove, however during seemingly random moments, the screen blanks out and comes back and I see some graphical bugs at the bottom for a split moment, then things return to normal. If this was once every once in awhile, I could deal, but it happens too often and ruins the game. Is there any hope of getting this issue to stop or should I just invest in a US glove instead (or maybe a Famicom...). It should be noted that my Everdrive is a Chinese one and although I've never had an issue with that fact, in theory it *could* be related.<br />Seriously any suggestions would be helpful. Cheers!

This problem doesn't seem to affect other people with the Everdrive (maybe I got unlucky), but it's an annoying thing that happens to me with it. Maybe try it with a different flash cart, if possible? Does Bad Street Brawler work?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, so I know this topic really only effects like... 3 people ever at most.. BUT. I fixed this issue. I wrote at least a dozen or so patches for this game to make it work with the J glove with no luck until I caught on today that the music reset to a previous point in the game when the flashes occurred. Well.. This clued me into the fact that the game was moving between points in time I.E. states. My flash cart (Everdrive N8) apparently supports save states, which I was unaware of. The issue here is that the input read by the &quot;center&quot; button on the Power Glove happens to trigger the save state combo and the load state gets triggered through the various movements involved in Super Glove Ball. <br /><br /><br />Long story short: Disable save stating on your Everdrive N8 with the patch made by Rainwarrior and you will be able to play this game flawlessly with a Japanese Power glove assuming you have either A.) A European Famicom or B.) An American NES modded to take in the Famicom EXP port as input. I sincerely hope this helps one of you dodge this issue in the future. Thanks to any of those that put any degree of thought or input into this thread.
