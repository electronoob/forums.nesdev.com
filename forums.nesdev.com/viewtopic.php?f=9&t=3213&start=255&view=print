<br />Actually, the biggest differences are in the mapper emulation, as far as I can see.  Even the MMC3 hasn't been fully 100% accurately emulated yet.  Since the PowerPak isn't using a real MMC3 for it's mapper 4 emulation, I can imagine that it too will not be 100% accurate.

<br />The good thing about the PowerPak is that it doesn't need to emulate things outside the game cart.  But there are and will be many bugs to fix inside the PowerPak in the foreseeable future.

<br />Why would you assume there are logic "bugs", especially in MMC3? If he didn't want to, bunnyboy wouldn't even have to design his MMC3, he could just use FunkyFlash's which clearly is 100% working despite the implementation being a little strange.

<br />I can think of several sources for MMC3 problems.
<br />
<br />* Support for both MMC3 and MMC6 without CRC detection or NES 2.0 headers will require ignoring $A001 writes and always having WRAM available at $6000-7FFF.
<br />* At least one game out there (name escapes me) will not work if WRAM is present.
<br />* On some carts, writing $00 to $C000 will cause only one IRQ to occur, whereas other carts will generate IRQs on every A12 clock.  I think Nestopia has to address this difference to get one or two games to work right.
<br />* Don't know if any games are affected, but on some carts if $C001 is written after the IRQ counter is reloaded but before the next A12 clock, the counter will be OR'ed with $80 on the next A12 clock.  (Kevin Horton found this behavior a while back IIRC.  Might be related to the $C000 thing listed above.)
<br />
<br />I'll be darned if the first set of drivers for the PowerPak can handle these issues, especially when NES 2.0 hasn't matured (and I doubt it ever will, unless Kev actually gets around to publicizing the mapper and submapper assignments).

<br />All of these problems would be from shortcomings of iNES, not bunnyboy's flawed MMC3 logic... You know everything doesn't have to revolve around iNES and iNES 2.0, PowerPak could let the user decide what to do in an ambiguous situation. PowerPak is already far more difficult to use than an original game, I don't think it would be unreasonable to leave a few options to the user.

<br />The name is Low G Man, and this is even worse programming as above.

When the feature was designed, there was a clear intent to try to avoid RAM corruption due to a software bug.  (That said, most if not all MMC3 games leave WRAM fully enabled at all times because the WRAM is used for more than just saved game data.  That same cannot be said for the MMC6, however, but that's only two games and I don't know if either game has any bugs that could corrupt saved data if WRAM were left on.)<br /><br />I will also point out that the PowerPak is being marketed as a development tool.  A developer working on an MMC3 game would like to know whether or not his work will function on real MMC3 hardware.  You can't know 100% without testing on the real hardware, but part of the drive towards accuracy is to mimic the real hardware as clase as possible (which is what sparked this discussion to begin with).<br /><br />If I were designing the MMC3 implementation of the PowerPak, I would ignore $A001 writes.

<br />Thanks for the game title.  I could be wrong, but I think there's also an SNES game that relies on open bus at a certain address to function (I remember a BSNES update needing to address this issue a while back).  It's a rather primitive form of copy protection, not a particularly good one for the reason you cited, but copy protection nonetheless.  Nintendo did require developers to submit any special copy protect schemes their software used when requesting approval for a game.  I guess Nintendo had no problem with using open bus as a means to do this (either that or the developer managed somehow to slip it past Nintendo).

<br />
<br />Developing an MMC3 (real MMC3) game sounds like a highly impractical move to me, anyways.  I would really advise against it.  The only source of MMC3 chips is existing carts, and getting to those would involve a whole lot of desoldering and/or rewiring.  What's more, is that there's several revisions of the chip.
<br />
<br />I never understood why people want to write new programs using the MMC chips (besides the convenience).  Sounds like the road to madness. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />My ideal cart would have 32KB of CHR-RAM that could be mapped to the 8KB of pattern tables in small chunks (1KB probably) so that I'd have the benefits of CHR-RAM and be able to do CHR-ROM-like tricks (large background animations), up to 1MB of PRG-ROM, divided in banks of 8KB (the last bank could be hardwired), 32KB of WRAM, and a cycle counter that triggers IRQ's. Oh, and mirroring selection. I would be able to do anything with that! =)

<br />
<br />I can think of one reason, game hacks.  There are countless number of web sites dedicated to game hacks.  A lot of those developers are currently using emulators to test their patches.  I'm sure many would love to see their creations on real carts.
<br />
<br />The ideal PowerPak will give them the ability to test their patches during the development cycle.
<br />
<br />With the PowerPak, issues like the now infamous "Mario Adventure" not working on a real MMC3 cart shouldn't happen again; as long as the MMC3 emulation on the PowerPak is 100% accurate.
<br />
<br />That's what I was hoping for when I first wrote that comment.

<br />
<br />Historically, it's been simply easier and cheaper to use existing PCB boards that were mass produced to develop and distribute homebrew. (According to Wikipedia, 33-45 million NES games were sold in the US alone!)
<br />
<br />Even if the PowerPak supported custom uploadable mappers, mass producing  PCB's to sell these games would be a daunting task for most developers.

<br />If I undersand what I read on another site about Mario Adventure, it won't work on real hardware because it relies on a emulator bug to work.  Could a tweaked version of the MMC3 code be made so it could work on a real NES via the PowerPak?

<br />
<br />From an emulation standpoint, the less accurate "H-Blank trigger" for MMC3 IRQ's is easier to implement, because an emulator can easily predict in advance when the IRQ will fire in that model.  However, in the PowerPak an H-Blank trigger will be harder because you only have access to the PPU address and data buses, and you'll have to do a more complex analysis of the PPU's activity to determine when H-Blank occurs.  Such a mechanism will only be reliable if the PPU isn't turned on/off mid-frame.
