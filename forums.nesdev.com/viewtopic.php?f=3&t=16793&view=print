Currently looking into a bug preventing Key Repeat checkbox check'iness.<br /><br />I've started working on improvements for the VICE/C64 emulator connection and support for C64 projects and running/debugging C64 PRG files [and disk images]. I know this isn't specific to the NES community, but I am not happy with how the IDE/emulators are tied together at the moment.<br /><br />What bugs prevent you from using NESICIDE [besides build/deploy madness]?<br />What features aren't there that prevent you from using NESICIDE?<br /><br />Yes, I recognize that IDEs aren't for everyone. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />I appreciate any feedback! PM or public. Thanks!

What would it take to adapt Qt-MFC to 0CC-FT?</div><br />If OCC-FT and JSR-FT are the same source basis at some point in the past [which I believe they are but I hadn't been following OCC to closely], it shouldn't take too much effort to get OCC in Qt. I'd just need the source. The whole point of the Qt-MFC layer is the source should air-drop as-is. Granted it's not absolutely perfect but it hasn't required too many tweaks as Famitracker went from 0.4.1 to 0.4.6.<br /><br />EDIT: Found/cloned GitHub source. Will do a comparison and see what's what.

Maybe do a ROM music &quot;record&quot; or a very simple space shooter accompanied by the same.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />howdy, <br /><br />i've been using NESICIDE to make a pretty sizable project for the 2017 compo ( <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&amp;t=16785">viewtopic.php?f=33&amp;t=16785</a><!-- l --> ), and one problem i encountered multiple times was with using multiple source code files. it's been a while so i may have done something wrong or  maybe i am slightly mis-remembering, but basically:<br /><br />if you have multiple files, the 'extra' files (anything beyond the first one) don't seem to properly update when the project re-compiles. for example, if i move all my zero page declarations into a separate file, i can't actually make any edits to that new file - they simply don't take place. again, maybe i was doing something wrong? <br /><br />other than that, i think more than new features, NESICIDE needs better documentation (again, maybe i have missed something). for example, the first time i opened tepples' HELLO WORLD program and tried to run it, i compiled it, then pressed play on the emulator. nothing happened! i had failed to load the ROM. i stumbled about until accidentally discovering i needed to load the ROM first. <br /><br />i had a similar issue adding extra graphics banks - the functionality is there, but i couldn't find a documented way to do stuff, so i just tried a bunch of things until one of them worked. worse, i have no idea which method eventually worked so i'll need to repeat the process next time i need to add more graphics. <br /><br /><br />all of these complaints aside, NESICIDE has been essential to me! i'm a pretty technically minded person who has been hobby programming for 20 years, and i was having a lot of trouble getting into other toolsets. NESICIDE was exactly what i needed to kickstart development in a way that didn't feel completely janky. so, thanks so much!

C++17 versus clang on OSX.<br />I know I should praise people that keep up with the latest trends in language development (Swift, anyone?) but using features from a standard that isn't finalized?!
