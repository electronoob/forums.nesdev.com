		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The games that use the MMC5 and 4-screen mirroring, 
<br />
<br />Bandit Kings of Ancient China
<br />Castlevania III - Dracula's Curse 
<br />Gauntlet (Licensed or Unlicensed) 
<br />Gemfire
<br />L'Empereur
<br />Laser Invasion 
<br />Nobunaga's Ambition II
<br />Rad Racer II 
<br />Romance of the Three Kingdoms II
<br />Uncharted Waters
<br />
<br />don't work well with the Game Genie at all.  For the MMC5 games, the background is entirely grayed out, only the sprites are visible.  For the 4-screen games, all the graphics are extremely corrputed and barely noticeable.  For After Burner, the graphics are only slightly corrupted.  These are the only licensed NES games that have any trouble with a Game Genie.  Could anyone tell me why?
<br />
<br />Also, recently I bought a NES Clone based off the Neo Fami.  Instead of the 60-pin cartridge and 9-pin gamepad connectors, it uses 72-pin cartridge and 7-pin gamepad connectors for NES cartridges and peripherals.  Unfortunately, all the above games fail to with it.  The MMC5 games suffer from severe graphics glitches or stall very early in the game, the 4-screen mirroring games suffer from wrong tile placement, and After Burner suffers from missing tiles.  I believe this has something to do with the unusual ways these games manipulate Nametables.  
<br />
<br />Interestingly, the Neo Fami, the clone upon which this device, (FC Game Console USA Version by Yabo) claims on its compatibility page that it can run After Burner and MMC5 games without a hitch.  (I don't know of any Famicom games that used 4-screen mirroring.)  Also, with the Game Genie and any one of the above games inserted into the clone, the Game Genie will display normally, while it would not on the real NES.  
<br />
<br />Now, if the Neo-Fami can run these games and the FC Game Console USA Version cannot, I would guess two reasons why.  First is that the FC Game Console USA Version is using an older version of the Nes-on-a-Chip which didn't get this behavior right, or that there is a wiring error from the 72-pin connector to the NES-on-a-Chip in the FC Game Console USA Version, which could potentially be fixed.

I also wish they sold an all dull-black version, like they did for the Neo Fami.  It looks allot nicer.  Too bad they didn't keep the controller ports standard, even on the USA Version, as the individual port shape is just as important as how both ports are placed next to eachother.
<br />
<br />So apparently these NES-clones are less accurate than emulators?  That is a pretty sad state of affairs.  Even worse yet is that the Kevtendo clone, which is supposedly super accurate, might not ever see the light of day.

<br />
<br />It just seems like he isn't willing to make Kevtendos himself by hand, find an investor to mass produce Kevtendos, or sell the intellectual property to somebody else who is willing to mass produce systems based on the IP.  I seriously pray for the day that I am proven wrong, but as each day goes by, I become more and more discouraged.  I would pay $300 for a fully functional Kevtendo, no questions asked... I would Paypal the money immediately.
<br />
<br />The Kevtendo is something that I almost wish I never heard of because now I know exactly what I won't be able to own.  Before, such a thing was a pipe dream.  Now, it is like the ultimate Nintendo Entertainment System cock-tease.  I also figure that if he does make a few by hand, that I would probably be pretty low on the priority list to be given a chance to buy one <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />Anyway, I realize that you know Kevin personally, so if you know something that I don't know, drop a hint or two... make my day a little brighter.  Or maybe you could steal the prototype that he currently has and sell it to me <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />
<br />
<br />You know, if he totally wanted to be a tease, he could demo the Kevtendo at the Classic Gaming Expo and other gaming conventions... get everybody drooling... then tell everybody that they won't be mass produced  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  I guess that could be a health hazard.

It really doesn't cost much, but it takes some time to modify the carts, and round up the rare ones (that no one wants to play so they are cheap, for now).
<br />
<br />I also bought a FDS RAM adapter (a HUGE thanks to Brad Taylor for his FDS Loader), constructed the cable so I could play all the FDS games.
<br />
<br />VirtuaNES can be set up, so its almost 100% authentic, and you can even find adapters these days for the controllers.
<br />
<br />I also built a MAME cabinet that uses a TV (hacked it for RGB), and it looks just like the arcade units, you can't tell the difference.
<br />
<br />I was thinking it would be super cool, if someone could adapt a current NES emulator to use the mame video drivers in DOS, so you could have 15khz output, and use an arcade monitor, it would look totally authentic.
<br />
<br />In fact you could even get real dot crawl, by using a RGB -&gt; NTSC encode. (google AD724).

It is not so good at running PAL NES games or games programmed by European companies like Rare and Codemasters (Micro Machines, Dizzy).  I don't think it supports the Game Genie (I'm not sure about VS System games.)  It has scanline glitches in games like Crystalis and Bad Dudes.

<br />Somebody needs to port Nintendulator to the Xbox.  The old FCE Ultra port is looking a little shabby these days.  I need more accuracy.

<br />FCE Ultra has one feature few other emulators can match, its ability to display at a variety of resolutions, including user defined ones.  I appreciate the ability to get a full-screen stretch without ugly interpolation artifacts by manipulating pixels while keeping integral ratios.

<br />I agree with this vertically, but horizontally, the linear interpolation artifacts make it look more like a TV. I tend to play in 3.636x by 3x scaled window on a 1024x768 LCD panel.

<br />
<br />Dunno.  Doom 3 crawls on an 800mhz PIII system, but it runs quite well on the Xbox.  There are too many variables for the comparison to work.  I guess it would at least be nice to have the latest FCE Ultra source ported to the Xbox, as that would drastically improve the current status of NES emulation on the Xbox.

<br />
<br />Apples to oranges.  Most of the levels required significant rework, and some features needed to be disabled or removed (notice the flashlight doesn't generate shadow volumes) to make Doom run at a decent clip on the Xbox.
