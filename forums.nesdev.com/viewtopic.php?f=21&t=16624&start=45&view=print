But this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wYXXtHgY9Y" class="postlink">video walkthrough of the AVS's video options</a> doesn't show such a filter.

You'd only need one copy of the tiles because the sprites could move up/down/left/right as needed, and the coarse background tiles would not need to be updated frequently (could probably get away with changing only one tile at a time as the horizon moves).<br /><br />The left/right motion would need some way to cut off the sprites behind the background, but there's multiple ways to accomplish that. (e.g. placing the sprites behind an opaque background, or if you can spare a third sprite on the scanline you can use a blocking background-priority sprite to hide it, or you could use horizontal tile permutations for the cutoff and only shift the sprites vertically.)

You can see a lot of diagonal groups where it's discoloured, but it complements the texture nicely there, esp. because the angle of the artifacts is the same as that diagonal direction anyway.<br /><br />The regular dither patterns above the flat stones, though, you can see how the varying emphasis the the regular shapes there produces strange grouping patterns. This will shimmer and stand out very strongly as soon as you start to scroll as well. (Especially note how about just below the middle of the image, there's lines of 4 pixels that are emphasized. That will change with scrolling, dimming and brightening every 3 pixels.)<br /><br />If you want to try it out without using an emulator, you could make 3 images with the tool, each with 1 more column of pixels on it to adust the phase of the artifacts. (Note: the phase changes only when you scroll-- when standing in one place it will not shimmer, so it's going to be driven by player movement, rather than being a continual animating thing like this GIF.)<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

	</div><br /><br />It's a subtle problem, though, not necessarily something you have to worry about. Unless you cover big parts of the screen with blocks of checkerboard, I think it's reasonable to just ignore, even.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">One last thing is in the way of making this scene work as a vertically scrolling room, and it's the 2D concaveness of the cross-section perspective (type B).

The parallaxing hanging chain is a nice touch (but doesn't really have to do with the curve). The tilted window feels weird to me without already trying hard to imagine that it's curved, and similarly the curved dark background bricks feel more like random variation / uneven stonework than a suggestion of curve.<br /><br />I like the attempt, but the effect isn't strong enough to unambiguously say &quot;curved tower&quot; to my brain. At the same time, though, I probably wouldn't want to spend as many extra tiles as it would take to imply that more strongly anyway-- as a square tower it already looks great. (...and I probably wouldn't even think twice anyway if there was an external long shot view showing that it was really curved from the outside. A square inside would be an acceptable fiction in this context?)

Then again, it might be too attention grabbing if it did cycle all the time. <br /><br />I guess the misty highlights along the floor could be tamed just like the sky gradient, but again at the expense of hogging a few more tiles.

It might be that my intention and preknowledge has got me fooled. I'll have to think about that. I'm pretty sure i can do a better job, but i think i'll let this scene rest for a while, and see what comes naturally later on. <br /><br />This is all very helpful, i really appreciate it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Normally, the NES PPU skips one dot before every second video field in order to make the dot crawl pattern appear stable. But it doesn't skip the dot if rendering is turned off. So to get that shimmering on an NES, you could leave rendering turned off for the first scanline for two consecutive frames out of every eight, ten. This may be tricky to time and may cause (invisible) flicker artifacts in the top overscan, I'll admit.
