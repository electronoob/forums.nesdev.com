They're often very hastily implemented (i.e. cheaply, and using the programmer with the least experience), added quickly and with displeasure for everyone involved, only because the publisher demanded it or had some other contract requirement to do so.<br /><br />A lot of &quot;splash&quot; screen style stuff is streaming video these days, too, which kinda works against the idea of using it to cover loading. ;P On one project a major publisher insisted that showing their video logo be the very first thing we implemented, and that is must appear in any build that was delivered to them (e.g. QA builds). I disabled it in my own build 'cause I'm a programmer, but most couldn't or didn't, and I thought it was utterly stupid how many collective man-hours were being lost on that project because of others waiting for this useless video to play on every restart.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I thank both of ya'll for your offers. Spent the last few months working on the Cowlitz Gamers Adventure sequel. Really excited about it as I pitched a sequel with a new artstyle and mock-up and it seemed to have been well-received by the programmer, so we're working on it together. Finished all the stage layouts and art assets about a month or so ago. Don't want to show much yet in case some parts end up getting cut from the game, but here's the title screen (for which I used thefox's tool to do palette and layout tests):<br /><img src="http://files.mteegfx.com/cga2TitleScreen.gif" alt="Image" /><br />The lettering style is based off of the hand lettering that I did for the first game's <a href="http://www.mteegfx.com/post/142657773444/cowlitz-gamers-adventure-packaging-shots" class="postlink">box art</a>.<br /><br />Here are a few things from Isolation as well:<br /><br />A computer terminal in a wall panel, player can move finger cursor along number keys only:<br /><img src="http://files.mteegfx.com/kga2052.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />A ladder-climbing cycle:<br /><img src="http://files.mteegfx.com/kga2062.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />And, I decided to go with #2D with emphasis bits set for the lights-out office screen I had previously posted about&#058;<br /><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/e6ccc363115d18ca39aa52218e1c8f06/tumblr_inline_oi0avwKJkz1t3povm_540.gif" alt="Image" />

I think emergency exit signs ought to be powered through separate lines and should be lit. <br /><br />The lone finger feels a little E.T. all on its own, but it is clear what it does. <br /><br />I just saw your bike trip animation, that was extremely good. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />  Top tier good use of the resources available. Have you studied classic film animation?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It looks good (especially the blackout, like what WheelInventor said) but there's always one thing in whatever you draw that aggravates me. The lone finger is a little odd (you could have possibly drawn the tips of knuckles) but the problem to me was how flat the finger looks across the keyboard when there is no way for that to be possible without the other fingers to be showing, unless they were cut off. I tried to fix that and make the finger look more natural overall, not being perfectly straight and reducing the size of the fingernail among other things. I don't know if you like it more, but my OCD was killing me. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In regards to the finger cursor, I haven't been completely satisfied with it, but the bottom 8 pixels will be cropped by most players anyway (That's the full, 240 px height shown there). So, I don't think adding some sprite tiles for the other knuckles would be worthwhile. However, you're right, the main reason the finger looks weird is that it is shown flat--not angled down toward the keyboard . I'll definitely re-approach that. Thanks for pointing it out.<br /><br />(The keyboard, by the way, is being held in the air by the character's other hand, as the keyboard is shown previously being stored in the vertical slot to the right of the monitor)<br /><br />@WI<br />Thanks. I took an animation elective in undergrad but didn't major in it and I'm not comfortable with it (frequently having to check resources like Preston Blair books or google walk/flight cycles as reference, etc.<br /><br />As for the exit sign, my early drafts had it on, but it shares palette with the green cube, and I'm worried that it might draw too much attention as neither are gameplay-relevant when the lights are off. May reconsider it though.
