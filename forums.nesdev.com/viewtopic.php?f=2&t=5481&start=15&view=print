<br />
<br />Which leads me to believe that...
<br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">You could always write your own extended assembly language that compiles to a .s file for ca65. That's arguably what Dennis Ritchie did in 1972 when he invented C.</div>
<br />might be a good idea. However, I'm not sure I want to add that program to all my sources or want to force people to download or even compile it themselves.
<br />
<br />So I'd rather write my own assembler from scratch OR a true cc65 replacement.
<br />Maybe I should first try if cc65 really is as bad as everyone says or if it's actually pretty usable if you take advantage of the things described above (parameters, code structure, etc.), but still write most of the code in ASM.
<br />
<br />On that note... with all the dead projects you usually see I thought, for some reason, that cc65 wasn't being updated anymore either. The last snapshot is from a few days ago, though. I better try contacting the author about my ca65 problems.

<br />
<br />My source had been in ASM6 until recently. I tried to break up my code and .include the other files into the main file, but then I got some dependency issues and I had to know the proper order to include the other files in. CA65 eliminated this problem.

<br />I've been pondering a bit more after your comments. I'm definitely going to switch to the file-scope, source/header, .export/.import way as there aren't any arguments against it except... laziness.
<br />
<br />I can still use macros the way I want, just need to have more elaborate variable names and .export them. My previous solution was definitely worse. So, yep, I'd consider my problems as solved for now. Thanks for everyone's help and suggestions. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />As for local symbols in ca65: I agree, they make code so much nicer to look at.

<br />
<br />Hmmm...  For some reason, there is big warning sign that comes to my mind when I see this.  I will elaborate.
<br />
<br />Defining an extra symbol for your function is fine but doing it for temp variable. hmm.. I feel debugging nightmare will ensue.  There is good chances that you will have only a few of those temp variables that you will use often so this is where it could get messy.
<br />
<br />Let say I have 2 temp variable and let's call temp Temp1 and Temp2 to make it simpler.
<br />
<br />For example, I decide for function A to rename Temp1 as a::param1 and Temps2 as a::param2.  For function B I decide to do the same and call Temp1 b::specialParam.
<br />
<br />Many weeks of coding later,  for some reason I decide that from method A, I have to call method B.  But... I forgot that a::param1 and b::specialParam are actually the same temp variable.
<br />
<br />I finish the code but now for some reason, function A doesn't work properly anymore and I cannot understand why.  There is some good chances that my scoping will be defined in the header files so I will never see while scanning the file that b::specialParam is now overwriting the content of a::param1 because when I read the code: I see 2 different variables. I will have no clue that they're using the same address, so is the next person that will read your code that doesn't know your code base.  
<br />
<br />You could always argue that "I know my code! I will remember that fact after 2 months", maybe. But what about the other guy that may use your code and doesn't not yet about that?  What if I have 15 temp variables that I shared under different names the same way?  I don't think that you will remember all the possible combination of those scoped parameters for the 15 temp variable used N time in your program.
<br />
<br />For now I feel it's not a good idea to share temp variables that way unless someone can prove me otherwise.  It may have seems a good idea at first but after analyzing it, I can only see pain during the debugging session <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />But in many cases you can't entirely avoid this problem. Imagine functions that work with temp vars internally, not as parameters.
<br />I wish the stack was more useful. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />Anyway, it's usually the first thing I check for when encountering an error that, at first sight, makes no sense to me.
<br />Just be sure to comment your parameter usage well and use different temp vars in NMI and you'll most likely get away without problems.
<br />
<br />It might be a good idea to write a utility that checks for such errors. Jump tables will still be a problem, though.

<br />
<br />It seems to me this is more than acceptable for an NES game. I can't imagine many situations where calls would be nested more than 2, or 3 times. It seems as though it should be very easy in most cases to correct mistakes where routines are trying to use the same temp vars. And of course if you "run out" of temp vars, you can hard code using the stack to save/restore these values. I'm trying not to worry too much about emulating higher level concepts while working on my project, except that which is practical. To me, practical means:
<br />
<br />1) easily navigable source code. Not one monolithic file
<br />2) concepts are seperated clearly
<br />3) you have a very good debugger like FCEUXDSP so at any point you can trace exactly what your code is doing at any point
<br />
<br />beyond that, we might as well code in C.

Already just defining local temp variables (file scope) will reduce the amount of code you will need to check if something goes wrong.
<br />
<br />If you have 15+ global temp variables that anybody can use at any time, the risk of having a bug that will be hard to figure out increase.  And if you use different names for the same memory location for temp variable, even more difficult to figure out.

<br />
<br />I'm going through all my code trying to scope everything and I found this thread, which is great btw.  I'm not familiar with using .h files.  I was just wondering what you guys stick inside them.
<br />
<br />Right now my .h files consist of only .import and .export commands.  For example, my sound_engine.h file looks exactly like this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.export sound_init<br />.export sound_play_frame<br />.export sound_load<br /><br />.importzp temp_ptr1</div><br /><br />and my sound_engine.asm has a line at the top:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.include &quot;sound_engine.h&quot;</div>
<br />
<br />Is this all I should include in my .h files?  Or do you stick things like constants/defines in there too?  I just want to know what is common practice.

<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.ifndef EXAMPLE_H<br />EXAMPLE_H = 1<br /><br />.global some_function<br />.globalzp some_zp_var<br /><br /><br />SOME_CONSTANT = 123<br /><br />.macro some_macro<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br />.endmacro<br /><br />.endif<br /></div><br /><br />Then, example.s would look like this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.include &quot;example.h&quot;<br /><br />.segment &quot;ZEROPAGE&quot;<br />some_zp_var: .res 1<br /><br />.segment &quot;CODE&quot;<br />.proc some_function<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; rts<br />.endproc<br /></div>
<br />
<br />That's similar to how you'd do it in C. The .global statements work like forward declarations in C, which is quite convenient, they're equivalent to .export when included from example.s (where the actual function or variable is defined) and equivalent to .import when included from anywhere else.
<br />
<br />No idea if that's the best way, maybe it could be done more elegantly in ca65... I'm not 100% familiar with all of ca65's preprocessor commands.

<br />in .asm file:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.export decodeMap<br />.proc decodeMap<br />&nbsp; ;code<br />.endproc<br /><br />.export testMapCollision<br />.proc testMapCollision<br />&nbsp; ;code<br /><br />.endproc</div><br /><br />in .h file:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.ifndef MAP_INC<br />MAP_INC = 1<br /><br />.import decodeMap<br />.import testMapCollision<br /><br />.endif<br /></div>
<br />
<br />I like doing it this way because it gives me max control over what gets exported and imported. Plus, having the .export right above the definition of a symbol makes it easier to maintain, and then the inc file is just a long list of imports.
<br />
<br />I have some header files that only contain commonly used structs, constants, macros, etc. These I have in a seperate directory from the sort of header file described above.
<br />
<br />*edit* now that I think about it, it may be a good idea to move structs/macros/constants that are primarily associated with a particular module into that module's header file.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I changed my stance recently on renaming temp variables.  If done properly, it can make the code more readable. 
<br />
<br />One way I do is like this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.proc subGetMetatileAttribute<br />;---------------- Parameters definitions ----------------<br />.scope Param<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;posX&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;= zpParam1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;posY&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;= zpParam2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;direction&nbsp; &nbsp;= zpParam3 <br />.endscope<br />.scope Local<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;metatileRow&nbsp; &nbsp;= zpTemp16Bit<br />.endscope<br />;---------------------------------------------------------<br />...<br />.endproc<br /></div><br /><br />At first I was finding it messy but actually there is a good point of doing this.  When you want to find if a temp variable is used, you don't have to scan the complete code but <strong>only the top</strong> of the function definition. This makes it easier to find where they are used.<br /><br />So in the function, when you want to use a parameter you do:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;lda Param::posX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;stx Local::metatileRow<br /></div><br /><br />when you call the method and want to set a parameter, you do<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;lda someValue<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta subGetMetatileAttribute::Param::posX<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Yes, I know it makes the statement bigger but it's now quite obvious by reading the code what you're trying to do.  This is one way that I use scopes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />you gave me an idea:
<br />How about, in zp, instead of individually defining a bunch of temp vars, just reserve space for "locals:"
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;in zp<br />locals: .res 32<br /><br />;and then for a proc:<br /><br />.proc MyProcedure<br />.struct Params<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;x .byte<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;y .byte<br />.endstruct<br /><br />&nbsp; lda locals+Params::x<br />&nbsp; lda locals+Params::y<br />&nbsp; rts<br /><br />.endproc</div>
<br />
<br />I guess the problem with that is how can you export (or, not really export but define for where you are using the procedure) the params struct for your procedure? You'd probably have to do something like .struct MyProcedure_Params in the header file for the module. Maybe that wouldn't be so bad. Next to every .import, include a struct for the params of the module. I think I might try this or your method. Thanks for the idea!
