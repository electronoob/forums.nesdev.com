Even better, it had fantastic other features like referring to the year 2000 as 19100 and basically having every security hole known to man.  We should definitely run that, because as we all know, solving social and behavioural problems with technology totally works!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Threaded discussions used to be popular on really old internet message boards. Nowadays, pretty much only Reddit uses it. Even Facebook did away with it (for more than a single level down).<br />I can see the appeal, but in practice it makes it hard to follow the discussion. It's very helpful for the people who branch off into a different discussion, but for someone like me who just likes to browse through all the discussions for an entire community (or search through archived threads), it's a huge useless mess.

In particular, nobody wants to have to click on each message separately. <br /><br />I am talking about simple hierarchical indentation of the actual message bodies. I suppose that view is called &quot;nested&quot; rather than &quot;threaded&quot;. That keeps the flow of a discussion while optically separating digressions.

It naturally breaks giant discussions down in a bunch of different sub-conversations. But for smaller conversations and communities, flat mode lets you feel a lot more invested in the entire conversation. Which I like.<br /><br />(I didn't include Soylent News because as best I can tell, it has about 10 active users, and doesn't really benefit from a threaded view)
