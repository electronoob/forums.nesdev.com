This gives you 160 characters, all of which have unique names and appearances. But every time you start a game or continue, it saves a flag in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_read-only_memory" class="postlink">PROM</a> stating that you have used up this character. Once you run out of "quarters" on the PROM, you need to buy a new copy.

<br />
<br />The thing with NES games is that they're all hard until you figure them out.  Once you figure them out then they get a lot easier.  With that in mind:
<br />
<br />Things I disagree with:
<br />
<br />- It mentions MM1.  None of the NES MMs are particularly difficult.  I guess MM1 can be thought of as hard because it doesn't have E tanks.
<br />
<br />I can still beat all 6 NES MM games with my eyes closed, without dying, without using E tanks.  Under that criteria, MM5 is definately the hardest, IMO.  But it still doesn't belong anywhere on a top 10 list... or even on a top 100 list.
<br />
<br />
<br />- It mentions Battletoads.  I can't beat it without dying, but I can beat it without warping and without any game overs.  The thing that makes this game seem hard is that every level is very different, so even if you figure out how to be really good on one level, you have to start all over on the next level.  But once you get it, it's really not that hard.
<br />
<br />- It mentions TMNT1.  
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />- It doesn't mention Linus Spacehead (either the stand alone of the Quattro one).  Have any of you tried this game?  It's impossible.
<br />
<br />- It doesn't mention any Dizzy game.  Fantastic Adventures of Dizzy in particular is ridiculously hard.
<br />
<br />- It doesn't mention Rolling Thunder.  This game's difficulty is very often overlooked.  And while I can't say that it belongs on a top 10 list, it certainly a lot harder than some/most of the games mentioned on that list.
<br />
<br />- There are a ton of J-only games that were pretty much impossible... like Holy Diver, Bio Senshi Dan, Wing of Madoola.  Though granted I guess those were Famicom games and not NES games.

<br />This is the exact same man who wanted your Playstation console *literally* explode if your character died or the game ended.  I'm paraphrasing (I can't remember the exact quote), but the gist of it is that he wanted either the physical game cartridge or the console itself to literally explode/melt down/whatever forcing you to buy a new one.
<br />
<br />I don't know why people find this guy "revolutionary" -- he's simply out of his fucking mind.

<br />PlayStation and PlayStation 2 consoles have two slots for EEPROM cartridges on the front panel, just above the controller ports. A game using this "$40 game = 160 quarters" concept on a PlayStation platform would have required specific memory cards that track which player characters have died.
<br />
<br />Someone needs to make a patch to Silver Surfer to make it playable. Such a patch would replace dying on contact with walls with wall-eject.

<br />Sorry, I should have said disc.  I was told said story back in late 1997 by a professional game developer (also happened to be my roommate), stating Kojima had done an interview where he explained either game development or consoles -- I can't remember which -- weren't sufficient for what he wanted.  He wanted a 1:1 relationship between the in-game character and the real world; if the game ended, he wanted that to be the end of the game PERIOD, as in you have to go buy another console/copy of the game/whatever.  I'm pretty sure I remember the focus being that he wanted the console itself to explode/burst into flame/whatever.
<br />
<br />I've been scouring the net for the past half hour trying to find said interview but I can't find anything concrete.  I've found a couple references citing Kojima's intense interest in "consequence-based gaming", but this mainly refers to situations where the player does thing X which has Y consequence later in the game.
<br />
<br />I really don't find him to be a genius.  He's just a weird dude.  I always imagine this guy going into his office at Konami at 02:00 in the morning, ripping off all his clothes and slapping his dick against all the PS3 consoles across the company; then going into the nearest bathroom, smashing and tearing down one of the stall dividers, standing horse-stanced (each foot in a separate toilet), and masturbating with a curling iron.  Basically I think he's one step away from becoming a member of Gerogerigegege.

<br />
<br />One could argue that the game leaves a very small margin of error, but it's certainly not unplayable. It's a pretty boring game though. The only positive thing about it is the music.
