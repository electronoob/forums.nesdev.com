Another recap: well, &quot;iNES&quot; is an emulator. <strong>blargg</strong> said that history is irrelevant, but perhaps not much. The &quot;iNES header&quot; and &quot;iNES mapper&quot; terms came from the iNES emulator, perhaps by its (name?) popularity (???) or the <span style="text-decoration: underline">only emulator at 199x that used the .NES standard format</span>. We had other formats, do you remember? Pasofami is one example in mind, the separated .chr and .prg (and .hdr?) files for loading, or .PAS files. So, &quot;iNES&quot; was the reference for mappers and the header, plus Marat's NES hardware document x Yoshi's one.

We use iNES because everyone keeps using the iNES terminology, which is &quot;wrong&quot; from another view point. iNES is an emulator.<br /><br />I remember of my own emu in early times. It was from &quot;xNES&quot;, but a few people was saying that the &quot;x&quot; would be a standard for linux/unix, and a name change would be good. So, that's RockNES today.

In fact there is nothing preventing that, this has been the case for about 15 years, and all of suddenly you want to enfore it to be named &quot;NES&quot; instead of &quot;iNES&quot; by modifying other people's posts and the wiki.<br /><br />But I'll tell you NES is a console, so you can't use this name either. You'll have to come up with a brand new name, such as qwio£w$iwi§en, which has probably never been ever used by anyone before.<br /><br />Now seriously, what about &quot;iNES&quot; itself is being disambiguated by the context, when it make sense it's the emulator it's the emulator and when it make sene it's the header/format then it's the header/format.<br /><br />If it's like : &quot;I tried iNES on my recent PC but I couldn't run it even with DosBox&quot;, do you think I am talking about the emulator or the header/format !?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />We have years of precedent of calling the header iNES, and this term appears in countless documents, emulators, past forum conversations, and elsewhere. New users regularly read these things and adopt the term as they see it used. To break from common practice on the wiki and nowhere else obfuscates the wiki. It doesn't matter if you think it's &quot;wrong&quot;, it's just the term that is used. This is communication, not a history lesson.<br /><br />The use of iNES to refer to the emulator is obscure (with apologies to Marat, but it's true).<br /><br />Incidentally, the wiki <em>is</em> a good place to put the history lesson as well. It is the perfect place to put notes explaining the history and etymology of terms used. It is, however, a very wrong place to rename things and start enforcing new terminology for purely ideological reasons.

It's just &quot;iNES 2.0&quot; for the extension described by kevtris that's not correct.

I think the lead should prioritize the iNES format description and not muddle things by talking about the emulator in the first sentence, but the amount of content about the iNES emulator on the page is fine.<br /><br />Emulators don't typically have a page on the NESDev wiki anyway. There's no dedicated page for more popular emulators like Nestopia or FCEUX. What would you even say about iNES that is relevant to NES development anyway?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, I fixed the iNES page. The lede reads better to me, and more of the information about the iNES emulator is moved to its section on the page. I added a section about the name of the file format. I also moved the information about the popularity of the format to the lede, keeping the file format section focused entirely on the format of the file.<br /><br />As explained in the section about naming, we have three different things:<br />* .nes files, which could be in iNES or NES 2.0 file format<br />* The iNES file format, which most .nes files are in<br />* The NES 2.0 file format, which emulators are adding support for.<br /><br />Thus, calling something the &quot;.nes file format&quot; is ambiguous, as a .nes file can be in either of the two formats. Once NES 2.0 becomes more common, to a layperson the &quot;.nes file format&quot; will be NES 2.0. Currently &quot;.nes file format&quot; probably means the iNES file format to most people. Thus it's best to think of &quot;.nes file format&quot; as something constantly shifting, representing whatever the most commonly-used files in the .nes format are in.<br /><br />Consider an emulator listing compatibility:<br />&quot;Supports .nes and NES 2.0 files.&quot;  <em>Huh, what's the extension of NES 2.0 files? I've only ever seen .nes files.</em><br /><br />&quot;Supports .nes and NES 2.0 .nes files.&quot; <em>Uhhh, aren't those the same things?</em><br />&quot;Supports .nes files in the .nes file format and the NES 2.0 file format.&quot; <em>Wait, how can a .nes file NOT be in the .nes format?</em><br /><br />Even putting the above technical issues aside, Marat may have referred to it as the .nes file format (and specified the layout), but it was the emulation community that ultimately got to decide what to name it. It came up with iNES, and many people call it this. That Marat called it a .nes file is irrelevant, because he doesn't define what is correct or incorrect; the common usage does. People who don't know the name of the format call it a .nes file, but this isn't a name so much as a description because they don't know a proper name. It's certainly important to explain the file extension used so someone who doesn't know the name can find information about. In effect, iNES file format became the more formal name, and .nes file format became the informal name. They coexist and the existence of one doesn't make the other invalid or incorrect.
