Yeah well I'm not native but since the words sounds, either very unjapanese or makes no sense for other reasons, unless you combine the diacritics with the character before them, most people probably learn fast that diacritics has their own character square in these texts (even though it looks a bit awkward). Of course depending on how comfortable you are with Japanese, it might not always be so easy to figure out if it's a real word or not.<br /><br />Dragon Quest uses vertical spacing for the diacritics in dialogue text, but not for the hero's name input. And since the hero's name comes up in dialogues there is a mix of the two types of diacritics, if you use diacritics in your name that is.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6013">Pokun</a> — Tue Jun 06, 2017 4:32 am</p><hr />

Yeah, horizontal diacritics are awful though. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />I'd guess that happens most often from the opposite direction of translation, being stuck with a English-centric system that has no gaps between lines but having to translate to Japanese.<br /><br />...though <a href="https://tcrf.net/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_III:_The_Manhattan_Project#Cheat_Codes" class="postlink">TMNT3 did some horizontal diacritics despite having gaps between lines</a>, so probably natives will do it too in a pinch. I'm not sure if it's just in cheat codes or if the regular dialog does it too.

Screen space is a big one. Since Japanese is typically shorter it does tend to take up less horizontal space, but at the same time it tends to require extra vertical spacing between lines to accommodate diacritic marks. Hiragana especially is hard to fit in an 8x8 box, so a blank vertical line in between also makes it easier to make them legible, so you can use all 8 lines instead of 7, leaving one blank for spacing.<br /><br />The Castlevania 2 retranslation ROM-hack efforts took advantage of this; I think reclaiming those blank lines (not used in the official English translation) let them put more text in that box. Some of its notoriously poor translation might have partially been due to cramped screen space because of requiring longer English words but having the same every-second-line text system in place.<br /><br />Though, applying to Zelda 2's title screen, I don't know if any of those constraints really mattered. It seems like the scroll split would have made it feasible to stick the katakana set on the other PPU page if they'd wanted to use it. It might very well have been that they just wanted it in English for other reasons already mentioned in this thread, and not technical ones.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sun Jun 04, 2017 12:10 pm</p><hr />

The fact that English is all over the place in Japanese culture always seems to surprise native English speaking people, but no one else (because it's all over the place in our cultures too). Bergalad and Sumez got it right, though it's about culture imperialism I say (which is something Japan also are often &quot;accused&quot; for, what with anime and video games and the like, but they are still way behind US in that regard).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Great Hierophant wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I know the Zelda 2 U.S. manual tells the story in a grammatically correct and perfectly intelligible manner, I assume the Zelda 2 Japanese story does the same for speakers of that language.<br /></div><br />It does, and the English translation of it is very accurate too from what I can tell.

It is expressing a shorter &amp; simplified idea, and expecting the reader/listener to fill in all the gaps under ideal circumstances, with the attendant comical mistranslation and misinterpretations</div><br />But besides the fact that Japanese sentences often can be kept short, I think that since kana have more characters and each character contains more sound than latin letters does, must play a part in making it shorter too. I mean you can express (very roughly) the same sounds with less characters. Now of course Japanese sometimes has quite long words, so I'm not sure how much it actually saves, and it can't be compared to kanji which of course do save a lot of space when long words can be written with just one or two characters.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Kanji usually takes a 16x16 cell to display legibly<br /></div><br />Ninja Gaiden games has 8x8 kanji, although I don't know how legible they are since I don't read them ^^</div><br />They are quite hard to read because 8x8 requires sacrificing many details in most kanji. Ninja Gaiden gets away by only using either less detailed kanji like 木 (tree) that doesn't suffer from the low resolution, or by using only very common kanji that are easy to recognize despite lots of details are missing. The brain kind of fills in all the missing details automatically. When I was a beginner student of Japanese, I had a very hard time reading 8x8 kanji, and because you can't see all the details exactly, I couldn't look them up in dictionaries either.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6013">Pokun</a> — Sun Jun 04, 2017 2:51 am</p><hr />

What's in English in this game apart from the intro, ending, and interface stuff (which is traditionally <em>always </em>in English in Japanese games, with only very few exceptions)?<br /><br />It's pretty common for Japanese games to have English intro scenes, too (more common with text scrolls like the one in Zelda 2, than with actually narrated cutscenes a la Ninja Gaiden). When there's otherwise Japanese text in the game, I think that rules out practical technical reasons, but I think it's very likely an English intro comes across more &quot;cool&quot; and movie-like to a Japanese audience.<br />Even though their English normally isn't the best, English language movies are very popular over there. Same as where I live, foreign movies aren't dubbed there, but shown with subtitles in cinemas, so they hear the language a lot, and I recognize the tendency from my own culture, where English is pretty much the &quot;movie and TV&quot; language. I know for a fact that they went with English vocals and Japanese subtitles for the Super Metroid intro to make it feel like a movie.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7819">Sumez</a> — Mon May 29, 2017 12:29 am</p><hr />
