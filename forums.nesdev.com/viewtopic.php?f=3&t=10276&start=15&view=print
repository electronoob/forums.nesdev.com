		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's a good question.  Apparently the answer is no.  Vs. Dr. Mario, for example, skips the check for two frames. Vs. Castlevania skips the check for 8 frames (probably due to loading CHR data).  So there are some opportunities for missing a coin, but they would be pretty hard to hit in practice since they're no longer than a handful of frames.  Some may in fact be impossible to hit if the coin switch is closed long enough.  It would really be helpful to know more about the coin switch timing.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To briefly drag this up from the past: I looked around for what seems to be the common name for these counters (&quot;electromagnetic counter&quot;) to try to figure out what any of them said about the timing.<br />What I learned is 1- Almost none of them talk about minimum on-time or off-time requirements; 2- A large number of them can be run off either 50Hz AC or DC; 3- Most of them are specified for a maximum number of counts per second; most values I saw for modern counters are rated in the range of 10 to 15 counts per second, with a few DC-only counters at up to 20 CPS; 4- Omron (one manufacturer) says that the maximum possible speed happens when given a 50% duty cycle, but they no longer make electromagnetic counters.<br /><br />#2 means that the on time must at least 20ms, or else these counters would do the wrong thing when fed AC. #3 implies the total on+off time doesn't have to be more than 100ms. Real-world game data implies that the on time doesn't need to be more than 50ms.<br /><br />So it looks like the right recommendation is &quot;3 vblanks on, 3 vblanks off, per count&quot;

It's in a single-screen Playchoice cabinet (not a conversion kit), that I currently have converted to VS SMB.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It took me far too long to do this, but I have gotten around to writing a set of simple tests for the Vs system.<br /><br />The one enclosed here explicitly targets a board that already has Vs SMB; I reuse its CHR and use the palette of the 2C04-04. It should be relatively easy to retarget it to any other PPU and existing CHR with a reasonably complete set of alphanumerics, although I'm currently cheating in a few places and don't currently have a hexadecimal-to-chr lookup table.<br /><br />There are five tests:<br /><ul><li>The VS system mainboard has a watchdog circuit made of a 74'123. The timeout should be <em>somewhere</em> around a second, but it'd be nice to know the actual value, and how consistent it is.<br />If the watchdog fires, a 6 digit hexadecimal number will display, <s>of which the bottom 20 bits are</s> displaying the number of counts it took before the watchdog triggered. <s>The topmost nybble should always be F.</s> A count averages to just a little over 8cy, or about 4.5µs.</li><li>How long does it take for a coin to fall through the coinbox?<br />Each time a coin is inserted, a 4 digit hexadecimal number will be added to the screen. Here a count averages to just a little over 11cy, or about 6.2µs.</li><li>The schematic implies that the coin counter is mirrored across the entire range of $4020-$5FFF. Is that true? We read from $5FFF and $5020 to attempt to cause it to count.</li><li>Is the extra memory for the Dual System available to us? It should be if we're in the master slot on the mainboard.</li><li>How fast can we drive the coin counter? The default (50ms on/50ms off) is guaranteed to work, but can it reliably go faster?</li></ul><br />In the archive is <span style="text-decoration: underline">e000.bin</span>, which can replace the corresponding 'PROM (1A or 6A) in a board that already contains Vs SMB. There is no need to replace any of the other 5 'PROMs.<br /><br />The code's a bit of crap, especially when it came to managing my time to not overrun vblank, so I turn rendering on and off too much. I have tested it in Nintendulator and Nestopia.<br /><span style="font-size: 70%; line-height: normal">This might be the first 100% original homebrew (i.e. not romhack) that both has and needs a NES2.0 header (due to specifying which PPU).</span><br /><br />EDIT: the previous version (.nes CRC of 4356ab7b, .nes date of 2014-03-26 20:22) had a stupid bug that didn't ever display the watchdog timer. Attached version now fixes that, plus the other idiosyncracies I've struck out above.

If in 6A, was the master 2A03 (2J) not populated?<br /><br />This is very exciting: the numbers are fairly consistent! The watchdog resets the system after 1.23 to 1.33 seconds without a read from $4017; a coin takes about 65ms to fall through the coin drop (but sometimes as little as 50ms); and at least <em>this</em> coin counter can apparently run about as fast as 25Hz!
