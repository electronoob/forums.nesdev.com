C64, Amiga, NES, SNES, Genesis, and any other system where the programmer has full control at the cycle level. Those extra VBlank lines really help out, especially on a system like the Genesis where you can write heaps more data to the VDP RAM during non-active scan.

<br />The PAL NES seems to be fun for demos, but I kinda fell like what I fell about using MMC5. A bit like cheating. Maybe even worse. You see, there's the PAL system and the NTSC system, but they are the same videogame, the NES. If you make something that only runs on half the NES's around, it doesn't fell like a NES game anymore. How come there is a NES game that doesn't run, and can't even be converted to run, on half (most likely more than half, no?) of the NES systems? Just doesn't feel right using all that VBlank time, you know?

<br />That's the main reason why I always devlopp games with NTSC in mind even if I'm from a PAL country. The second reason is that the NES is a japaneese console basically, and that the original japaneese NES is NTSC. The PAL NES is just a "port" of it.
<br />However, the whole PAL VBlank could be used in a game where several frames are needed for some thing to be written to the nametable/pattern table and cause slowdowns, but could be fast up on a PAL system by taking less frames. This would "compensate" the fact that the system runs 5/6 slower.

<br />What part of bit $2002 bvc :- lda #0 sta $2001 don't some PAL-to-NTSC porters understand? If you limit your NTSC version to 192 scanlines, using either sprite 0 or the mapper's timer or both to detect the top and bottom of the window that you want to use, then you have just as much vblank time as any PAL NES has.

<br />I agree. If you're improving something, I guess that is OK. The wrong thing is when you can say this about a game: "This will not run on a NTSC console, never, ever, no matter how much you change it".

The way I understand it, the hiding of those 16 scanlines was more a function of NTSC overscan rather than the NES not outputting them. An NTSC Genesis has 224 addressable scanlines, but 240 total outside of blanking, however it's impossible to see those 16 lines of border on most NTSC sets (but it is possible to view them on an underscanned monitor), so the system doesn't even give you access to them (it's possible to switch a PAL MD to 240 lines of addressable screen, but this doesn't work on NTSC).

<br />The only part of this I can't figure out is how to generate an actual /write pulse for the VRAM.

<br />The 21.5 MHz master clock is visible on the cart edge, right? After a PPU read cycle, you could wait a few 21.5 MHz clocks and then generate the /write pulse. Or are you talking about pin count?

<br />
<br />Nope, at least not on top-loading NES's and Famicoms.  So that's no good.  I dunno where to get the pulse.  If I took CHR /RD and put it through a delay line maybe that'd work, but that'd cause the dumb situation of having VRAM updates not doable during vblank.. heheh.  And delay lines are expensive anyways.
