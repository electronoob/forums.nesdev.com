		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I have my ROM that i'm attempting to put onto a NES cart by burning the CHR and PRG ROM onto new chips. I have everything ready... except the initial ROM separated into CHR and PRG.
<br />
<br />I am using HEX Workshop and trying to follow the instructions <a href="http://nintendoallstars.w.interia.pl/romlab/prepare.htm" class="postlink">posted here</a>... but it does not tell how to save the files, what to name them, what format to save them in, and what part of the file is PRG and what part is CHR (although I believe that the PRG is the first part of the ROM).
<br />
<br />Any help would be great. Thanks.

<br />Normaly, this would be the end of the ROM file.

<br />Name the files as you want. Usually, PRG.bin and CHR.bin are done, but that doesn't matter, as long as you burn the good ones.

Is there a simple way to understand it?<br /><br />If the file (after removing the header) is 524288 bytes, can't you just go to line 00040000 and cut everything above it and save that as the CHR (if both PRG and CHR need  to be 256k)? That's half... right?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Name the files as you want.

<br />That I got. I didn't know they needed to be in '.bin' form to burn.
<br />
<br />I'm really sorry for sounding so noobish, but I was hoping that there would be a simpler way to understand this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So tokumaru emailed me this, and it helped me understand a bit better.
<br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">As that page says, if the game uses CHR-RAM, all that follows the header is the RPG part, there is no CHR part.<br /><br />If you are not sure about the sizes of PRG and CHR of the game you are using, open it in an emulator like FCEUXD, NINTENDULATOR or NESTOPIA that tell you how much memory each part uses. Of course you can read that from the INES header yourself.<br /><br />After you know how large the PRG is, convert it to bytes (you'll probably get that information in kilobytes, so you multiply by 1024 to convert to bytes). Convert that to hex and you'll know what to select in the hex editor. After you have the PRG part saved, the rest is CHR.<br /><br />I don't use that hex editor, but based on those instructions, you can delete the header and then save two copies of the rest. With the first copy, you delete the CHR, with the second, you delete the PRG. For a simple NROM game, for example, PRG is 32kb and CHR is 8kb. so the ROM file is 40kb + the 16 byte header. If you do it like I said, you'll remove the header and save 2 40kb files. With one of them, select from $0000 to $7FFF (32kb) and delete. Save that as "chr.bin" or something like this. With the other file, delete from $8000 to $9FFF (8kb) and save as "prg.bin".<br /><br />Program always comes first, and CHR comes righ after it, if it exists.</div>
<br />Now, I understand it a bit better, but i'm still confused about those $ you all put in front of letters and numbers. I can't see those on my HEX editor. Here's an image of an NROM (DK3) I opened. I can't see the $8000.

<br />
<br />So would I be correct in thinking that the PRG and CHR for Moon Crystal would be 256 each, that I would remove $0000-$3FFF for the CHR and remove $4000-onward for the PRG?

<br />You mean $3FFFF and $40000, right? If so, you are right.

<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.snakeyes.org/util/nes.php">http://www.snakeyes.org/util/nes.php</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />When you run it, have the .NES file in the same directory/folder. After you load up the ROM, you'll see a few options. Covert it to Pasofami format. You will be left with three files: .PRM, .PRG, and .CHR. You won't need the PRM - I'm guessing it's just header info in a different file. You can just use the PRG and CHR to burn right to your chips.
