I did my testing back in world 2 in a spot without access to deathpits, so the long time before an iceblock disappears stymied my efforts.<br /><br />Besides, doing a running jump off of an up-B-placed block to a midair down-B gets you far enough for everything I could find. I suspect the world 1 level showing vertical transitions could be skipped about thusly.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> as long as it's not so &quot;useful&quot; that the entire game ends up being played like that, and as it's still somewhat difficult to pull off.</div> It doesn't work without a deathpit (or lava/water, but either means you can just use icepower to walk across) and iceblock power is mostly unavailable until world 3 (…outside of the shop, hmm. But, at 30-40 a pop, and no currency multipickups, it's not cheap.) On a spike pit, it already acts like Shovel Knight's Mobile Gear, intentionally [as we've had that &quot;something cool&quot; secret behind onesuch] so…<br /><br />Also, iceblock power doesn't kill enemies, only stuns, which is a surprisingly large drawback!

I probably should go and make statistics for the amount of money in each level so I can get a feel for what the average amount is.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You're probably gonna have to revamp the shop menu anyway, since it's <sup>close to</sup> full-up now (once you add more abilities). Probably break into sub-menus.<br /><br />An addition that currently might make sense: eat-in (that is, immediately applied) <s>riceballs*</s> pizza. Even if you do normally refill health between stages, an eat-in XL would make sense [starting with 8 rather than 4]. Of course, a small discount would apply compared to take-out.<br /><br /><strong>Bug report:</strong> You can reorganize the pause menu on page 2 with select, but it doesn't move the actual actions (at least, not Exit Level- I moved it to the bottom, and it did nothing there, but empty slot 1 then would still exit level). It also doesn't save the new positions…unsurprising as I don't think this was quite intended.<br /><br />hey, the shop menu doesn't wrap horizontally. That would reduce the maximum number of presses to get to any item by 3, y'know.<br /><br />A buy-multiple (10?) option would be nice?<br /><br />The shop doesn't tell you &quot;you can't have more of those&quot; when you try to buy more than 99 of an item, though at least it doesn't charge you.<br /><br /><strong>Bug report:</strong> fireballs can stick in ground. Bounce a normal shot from an exactly four-block-high drop [there's one in last room of 1-1…but no fire enemy] and it'll stick into the lower ground. (Five doesn't work.)<br /><br />Huh, world1's music is gone. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />*<span style="font-size: 75%; line-height: normal">Eat your hamburgers, Apollo.</span>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ten abilities seems like a good number to me. Kirby's Adventure (for comparison) has about 20 normal ones, with weird duplicates like fire/burning and ice/freeze that I would have combined. You're right that there isn't a lot of space for potential additional items of any sort in the future though.<br /><br />The eat-in could make sense for fixed-inventory stages, giving you a little help since you can't carry outside items in.<br /><br />I took out the music a long time ago because a &lt;30 second loop that plays throughout the entire game got a little annoying. I'll probably actually use that theme a bit later in the game.

The controls feel a bit too slippery for me, though, even with the slow setting.<br /><br />I found a bug: if you slow down just before falling off a block and turn back while falling, you &quot;zip&quot; back up. I created an animated GIF. (This bug may already have been mentioned; I didn't read the whole thread.)

Since it provides some leniency that might be helpful, but I also get complaints about it.<br /><br />I'm not sure what I should do about the slipperiness, probably provide a mode that turns off acceleration completely? But I think instantly jumping between speeds of 0, 2 and 4 pixels per frame might not be very good for a game that requires a lot of accuracy. There's the &quot;fast&quot; acceleration mode at the very least, which doubles acceleration and deceleration speeds.

The original had a bug allowing sticking to a wall and jumping from it, and I recast it as the ability to grab a ledge and scoot up like in <em>Prince of Persia</em> or <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> My version added a tradeoff between mobility and offense: ledge grabbing can't be used while tossing blocks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My goodness, it's been a long while since I updated anything on here, hasn't it?<br /><br />Nova the Squirrel is <em>still being developed</em>. I think I have about 7 levels and 4 bosses to make before I think I'm satisfied with the gameplay aspect of things (for a total of 33 regular levels and 7 boss ones), which I expect to be able to finish this year? Though I continually said that the other years too. Really the hardest part throughout the whole game's development has just been level design which pretty much requires me to solve a puzzle in reverse. The remaining levels are mostly action-oriented so that should help a lot. Aspects that don't require a lot of creativity should also be quick.<br /><br />I <em>am</em> most likely going to push past 128KB into needing a 256KB cart, but not by much and that'll give me space to play around with just freely adding stuff without caring about size. I have ideas for stuff I'd put in that wouldn't take long, like a level editor, a copy of DABG, concept art, maybe two music banks, etc.<br /><br />After the gameplay I'm going to want to add a lot more polish and I need to put in a soundtrack and everything. Some of the polish I've been focusing on has been making the game just look better (especially on the first world) so I can convince people to keep playing and get to world 2, where the real fun starts.<br /><br />I should also think about the eventual cartridge release; I'm gonna have to commission a cartridge label or something at the very least, find a publisher willing to manufacture SNROM carts (and people are insisting on green shells), write a manual...<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AnKj1nQ.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/zM0wy0f.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/fykCy9S.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wPD08uh.png" alt="Image" /><br />Level screenshots<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/x131liR.png" alt="Image" /><br />I'm adding more tilesets to make the game more visually appealing and I'm trying to add a lot of graphics if I can. These giant trees reuse already existing metatiles which works nicely because I'm not running up against the engine's 256 metatile limit. Though, I have ~50 left anyway, and the game's getting close to done so it won't matter.<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XDTXyld.png" alt="Image" /><br />A cloud theme for levels that are set up high in the sky.<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d638EiI.gif" alt="Image" /><br />Animated water. I guess I need to learn how to <em>draw</em> animated water now, preferably with more than two frames of animation. Maybe other things would make sense to animate?<br /><br />There's <a href="https://i.imgur.com/4eSi7u7.gifv" class="postlink">fake parallax</a> using sprites in some levels too now.<br /><br />I've also been adding a lot more mechanics like <a href="https://i.imgur.com/9PjhMjy.gif" class="postlink">laser beams</a> that are blocked by obstacles and that act as walls, blocks that can spawn in enemies, and other stuff. There's now a one-per-level collectible that is usually behind some sort of challenge.
