Newer thought of selling any botlegs. Until now ... just kidding. I collect games just for myself. <br />I have read many topics about why not destroy games to make other games. Simillar to that are people that buy Sonic and Knuckles cart just to rip out the connector for their Radica mod. <br />But ok, I will change my plans if you are saying that this particular game isn't a common one. Haven't got a clue about that. I newer wanted to destroy a not common game. Really. Japanese only RPG's are something that I never have considered rare. I think it's obvious for somebody not able to read japanese texts.<br /><br /><strong>EDIT:</strong><br />ok I've scratched the project, can at least somebody tell me whitch ips patch should I apply to the original J rom to have the MMC3 version, untranslated and closest to the real thing? thanks (I already mutilated one SMB3 cartridge for SMB2j so this one is lost anyway)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4580">jpx72</a> — Mon Nov 01, 2010 2:26 am</p><hr />

It often annoys me how people on the internet like to lecture others about the importance of their stuff.

Fascinating? You swap out the ROM chips for something else. Not really that amazing. What do you mean apply contra IPS patches to it? Not that it's the end of the world that you destroy this game to make a bootleg, but the problem is there are lots of people that are all thinking the same thing.
