When I get there the last byte of the sample used for synchronization in <strong>begin_dmc_timer</strong> is still playing, meaning the first write to $4015 queues up another sample and the second write to $4015 has no effect at all.<br /><br />Similary, there's a call to <strong>time_code_end</strong> (alias for <strong>end_dmc_timer</strong>) at the end of <strong>test_</strong>. <strong>end_dmc_timer</strong> starts with<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.align 64<br />end_dmc_timer:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;; Restart<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$1F<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta SNDCHN<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;nop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta SNDCHN<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;; Rough sync<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ldy #-$45<br />@coarse:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;nop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$10<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bne :+<br />:&nbsp; &nbsp;dey<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bit SNDCHN<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bne @coarse<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;; DO NOT write to memory.

However, (428*7)/16 = 187.25 and (428*8)/16 = 214, meaning y will either end up very small or underflow. For y &lt;&lt; 4 | x to have the expected value of ~528 y would have to be about 32 though, which seems impossible.<br /><br />Any ideas? Is this some off-by-one error? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" />

So SNDCHN bit 4 will be cleared 54+428*7=3050 cycles later. Thus if the loop finds it clear the first time through, it's been at minimum 3050 cycles since the earlier BIT SNDCHN, or 2976 cycles of user code between calls. 2976/16 = 186, so Y should be 186 if the coarse loop never iterates. -$45 is 187, and the DEY always executes at least once, so this gives the correct Y.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; -1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ldx #-$2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; 2<br />@sync:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; lda #$1F&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; 2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sta SNDCHN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; 4<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; 4 DMC DMA<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; lda #179&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; 3402 delay<br />:&nbsp; &nbsp;nop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; nop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; nop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; nop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; nop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; nop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sec<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sbc #1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; bne :-<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; inx&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; 2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; lda #$10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; 2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; bit SNDCHN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; 4 reads 3424 cycles after BIT SNDCHN in coarse loop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;&nbsp; &nbsp;then every 3423 cycles<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; beq @sync&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; 3</div><br />The fine sync loop reads at the same relative time to the DMC sample ending as the coarse loop, thus it always reads after the sample ended on the first iteration and loops back at least once. If the user code took 2976 cycles, it will find the sample not ended on the second iteration and exit the loop, leaving X at 0 as desired.<br /><br />If the user code took one cycle more, the two loops would have read one cycle later, and the fine sync loop would have run one time more, leaving X one greater at 1.<br /><br />I think I used negative initial values for X and Y because I tuned this empirically; I started out with 0 for X and Y, timed some zero-cycle user code, then took the resulting value, broke it into the high 8 bits and low 4 bits, negated these, and put them in Y and X, so that I'd get 0. I never did the above careful timing analysis, because in my experience it's time-consuming and can easily overlook something critical, while empirical testing and tuning is efficient and reliable since it involves writing edge-case tests to be find the stable range. It was fun to verify this by careful analysis though, so thanks for the opportunity.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Started digging into the circuitry a bit, and it looks like the 2A03 handles <strong>rdy</strong> for OAM DMA and PCM reads in a pretty clever way. Rather than just pulling <strong>rdy</strong> low for a fixed safe &quot;minimum&quot; time, it first pulls it low and then waits for a CPU read. Once it sees a read, it knows <strong>rdy</strong> must have kicked in, and moves on to doing the transfer.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In case it's helpful to future people pulling their hair out over this one:<br /><br />To pass, it's important that the first $4014 write lands on an even cycle (and so only adds a single dummy cycle). Since the test synchronizes to the DMC, getting this right depends on the DMC clocks happening on even cycles too, which in turn depends on the power-on value of the DMC timer (the one counting down and getting reloaded with the period when it reaches 0). On the real thing, I think the power-on value is 428 (or the equivalent at least - it uses a linear feedback shift register), though only the even/oddness should matter for this test.<br /><br />If you get 528,527,528,527,... instead of 527,528,527,528,..., that's likely the problem.
