<br />
<br />It was a new LCD HD TV and when the image would scroll, the image would be blurry, like it doesn't refresh fast enough.
<br />
<br />Do plasma TVs do this too?
<br />
<br />Maybe the higher end LCD TVs don't blur as much?

In low detailed 2D games like NES games, when scrolling you'll notice this weird blur that stops when the scrolling stops. I'd guess it's response time related but I'm not really sure. 
<br />
<br />Some HDTVs may be better than others, it could be related to a number of things. However I don't remember Donkey Kong Country being a game to notice that effect on. Ofcourse I play my emulators on my PC with scanline blitters. 
<br />
<br />For retro games, I recommend you get a good CRT TV or Monitor. I play my NES games on an original gray toaster system with a Sony PVM Monitor. For SNES I use my Super Famicom with the same Sony PVM via RGB. The games look the way they were intended this way. But you know you just gotta figure out what works for you. 
<br />
<br />I also find a modded Xbox is a good way to emulate retro games as you can set the video mode to 480P which should improve image quality alot.

<br />If someone owns a HD-LCD TV why would they want to use an xbox for there emulation needs when a PC can connect to one stock? Yes they are quite usefull for CRT TV's but dont seem to make sence for HD.

But 80 ms is different.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If someone owns a HD-LCD TV why would they want to use an xbox for there emulation needs when a PC can connect to one stock?</div>
<br />Because you'd have to buy another PC to put in the same room as the TV.

<br />btw for those who want a consoles emulated on consoles the Wii is comeing along quite niceley in that department and the newley finished  (Not actually finished but works well and is quite nice) <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=6ji2imug_bc" class="postlink">homebrew</a> <a href="http://hbc.hackmii.com/" class="postlink">channel</a> makes is convinient to launch stuff.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The blur is caused because liquid crystal molecules just don't move fast enough. So, you have white on one frame, and black on other, the molecule starts moving to get the color change, and it will not end its moving by the next frame, so you'll get a grey, which will end up as black if the next frame is black too... if next is white it just will end up being some tone of grey... that's what causes the blur and there's no way around it.
<br />
<br />LCDs are slow but high res, Plasmas fast and high res too, but die too soon, CRTs are really fast, live long but the "res" depends on the size of the screen.... one alternative would be organic LED TVs, but that techology needs to evolve... they have excellent properties, but have too short lifetime and have other issues.

<br />
<br />I really wish someone made modern CRT HDTVs.  These limitations are such a drag to a retrogamer.
<br />
<br />Are there any sites that compare the least blurry sets out there?

<br />
<br />Oh I'm glad I'm not alone on saying how new monitors are bad. Tough I don't know if they are THAT bad, but I just find the colors looks so much better on CRTs than LCDs... Altough the GBA is LCD and is still very playalbe (altough I got some dead pixels).

<br />That's exactly what they do, though they're not applying an NTSC filter, they're just plain decoding the NTSC signal, since that is the only way they can get the image. Unlike an emulator, they don't have the original ideal image.

<br />
<br />the only reason they make non-HD look so crappy it because they are pushing HD... kind of like nintendo tactics... they weren't running out of Wii's they just repeated what they did with the NES ROM's (orchestrated a fake shortage)
<br />
<br />basically what will happen is some people will get mad and do something about it... like atari <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> but i think they will have a hard time trying to stop someone from perfecting video signal conversion
