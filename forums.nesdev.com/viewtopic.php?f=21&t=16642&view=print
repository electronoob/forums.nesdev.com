I've found a number of tools, but some are quite old and appear to be unmaintained.<br /><br />Ideally, I'd like to sit down with a handful of tools and evaluate them, but I'm not sure which of them should be on the short list.<br /><br />Thanks for any pointers!<br /><br />-Mick

It doesn't matter that they're not NES-specific, once you know the rules of what the NES can do it's easy to make NES-ready art in most good graphics programs.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/119/" class="postlink">YY-CHR</a> is also popular because it can edit graphics tiles directly from a ROM, but it hasn't been updated in many years and it's not really that capable as an art program. I don't like to use it because once you learn to get the data out of or into a ROM, there's no advantage left for YY-CHR.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If NESST was great when i began a year and a half ago, it's indispensible now with the lasest added features. I really recommend reading through the readme/changelog because there's quite a few neat features you might miss otherwise. <br /><br />The only feature i think i &quot;miss&quot; frequently at this point is something like a &quot;save selection to file&quot; + &quot;load file to clipboard&quot; combo so i could easily cut and paste between several NESST instances. <br /><br />Since i need the adobe suite for other things, i'm also using PS and AE for some stuff, especially for trying out sprites/animations on top of backgrounds and see how they fare.

(I'm sure <span style="color: #60FF60">tepples</span> has automated this part).<br /><br />And I open it in NES Screen Tool, and make metatiles and metasprites. Export the metasprites. Screenshot to save a pic of the metatiles. Crop in GIMP.<br /><br />Use Tiled to construct the levels from the screenshot of the metatiles. Export csv. Use a python script to compress the data. Import into game.

Haven't really gotten to the point where I use its sprite facilities, but the few times I've messed around with it, I've found it easy to use.

I share this image a lot: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://i.imgur.com/qigHvaN.gif">http://i.imgur.com/qigHvaN.gif</a><!-- m --><br /><br />But it also doesn't really allow one to work with palettized images.

If you can get used to its UI, it is very powerful, and also allows tilemap editing. <br /><br />And for good measure, one obscure program which fixes some of Pyxel Edit's tile problems, but I still end up preferring Pyxel Edit: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=14983.0">https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=14983.0</a><!-- m -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm amazed people mention GIMP for drawing things. That program seems like it was designed to be impossible to use from the start. I once tried to use it to resize an image, but even that simple task is almost impossible to do with GIMP (at least not without looking up a tutorial) so much is this program counter-intuitive. I can't imagine <em>drawing</em> anything with that.

(I used <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/" class="postlink">Paint.NET</a> instead, which is a pretty good simple paint program but it's not very powerful.)<br /><br />Then I watched this tutorial, and it really got me started:<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PONe4IIYSnQ" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PONe4IIYSnQ</a><br /><br />Since then I've been pretty comfortable with it.<br /><br />So, in case anyone is interested in learning GIMP for pixel art, I highly recommend that video. (Otherwise there's plenty of other good art tools. I just happen to like GIMP.)<br /><br /><sub>Sorry, I linked it already in my post above, but it was kind of buried as a footnote.</sub>
