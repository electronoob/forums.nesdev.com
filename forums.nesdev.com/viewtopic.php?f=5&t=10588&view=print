		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm in the market for an NES, and while I'm certain I could find one at a swap meet if not on ebay/amazon, I'm curious about the Retrobit line of aftermarket consoles. I see consistent reviews that the sound and even the color is off. It is apparently very light in weight. And the top loader on at least one version has multiple reviews of a very tight fit for NES carts. <br /><br />Out of all those things, the sound reviews bother me most. But have any of you tried it? What did you think?

(A lot of clones can't run PowerPak, MMC5, or Rad Racer 2.)<br /><br />But I have used a Retrobit replacement controller on an authentic NES, and its Control Pad was fairly mushy. And when a Control Pad is mushy, it becomes difficult to press straight to the side without inadvertently hitting a diagonal.

The controllers are, as tepples mentioned, forgettable.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, that's about what I've gathered. They're a cheap, cheap company.<br /><br />Instead of buying a Retrobit, or even an NES, I ordered a Raspberry Pi. I would have an enormous smile on my face if an NES just appeared on my desk, but between spending on that or on something that could run NES, C64, and everything else (and could even be used to &quot;fix&quot; a broken NES later on), the RPi won.

Software is naturally free (until it's fenced off with a proprietary license) but hardware has supply and demand. Practically, I view these systems more as virtual machines which also have dwindling supplies of supporting (and often worn) hardware. Obviously, if it's genuine hardware you're after, NOAC is not what you want anyway.

Are we hoping for a new run of hardware in the &lt;$100 USD range? I'd absolutely love that, but I don't see it happening. <br /><br />But yes, an emulator should be as accurate as possible to the hardware it's emulating... And the emulator is the virtual machine.

All of these things can help with the emulation and with designing hardware clones.<br /><br />You can design a game even if you have no intention to put in the cartridge and put in a real hardware, but if so you should still be aware that someone might do so, and if designing a NES/Famicom game it ought to be designed to work on a real hardware too in case someone is going to do that (I have designed a very small subset of the MMC5 mapper for precisely this reason).

And the ones that cost less almost assuredly have some significant difference from the original silicon.
