There's a bunch of kids in the Ask Capcom forums... and while I don't reply for them, there are some nifty and ugly things enough to get on my nerves! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />- I've played MM7 in 1995, but it wasn't as fantastic as MM6, perhaps because of a "bigger" world. A guy said that this game "kickass". I wonder if you share the same opinion about the game... ^_^;; Even another kid has requested a MM11 with MM7 gfx, lol.

<br />Story-wise, it wasn't memorable
<br />
<br />Gameplay-wise, it was good.
<br />
<br />It seemed to be lacking in the Rock 'n Roll musical inspiration the earlier MegaMans had... but I liked Slashman's theme. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> 
<br />
<br />Overall it was fun, &amp; the bolt-collecting was a real plus.

I'm not all that great a gamer so I'm not sure how the rest of you fared, but I know it took me many tries, beating all 8 bosses and finally arriving at Wily with enough energy tanks to beat his final form. The first form is ridiculously easy, I found I could beat it without losing any energy.
<br />
<br />For me, while the sound track was decent, it didn't have the incisive awesomeness that the 1-6's soundtracks had, or Mega Man X 1-3.

<br />
<br />What's strange about the MM7 fangame is you have to use a keyboard emulator to play with a controller.  Some guy takes the trouble to create a Megaman game and he's like, oh yeah they'll love playing this with the arrow keys.

<br />I agree 100%
<br />Bosses were so hard because both Mega Man and the Bosses were so large they took a significant space on the screen.
<br />
<br />Most bosses are hard to impossible to beat without their weakness, while on the NES games, using their weakness is doing it the "cowardly" way.
<br />Another issue is the quite a few things are ripped from older MMs. (Cloudman's stage is ripped from Air Man's for example).
<br />
<br />On the plus side, call me crazy or wathever but I like the music in MM7 much better than it in MMX series. I also like the style of game-play.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />idk about impossible to beat without there weakness. Ive only beat the first 4 bosses but so far with most of them all you gotta do is slide under the boss when there jumping and avoid there projectiles. I agree the game play is not as good due to the oversized characters though.

<br />That's strange,but I liked Springman theme.
<br />I choose second option in poll.
