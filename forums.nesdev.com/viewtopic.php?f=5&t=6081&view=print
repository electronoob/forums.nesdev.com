		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My only obstacle to installing linux right now is that a lot of my custom tools for NES development were written in C#. I don't know for sure if these tools would work with Mono, or not. In addition, from what I've read and have found, FCEUXDSP 1.07 is only for windows, and it is the only version of FCEUX that has its symbolic debugging feature fully working (as far as I can tell). So I'm wondering if it works with Wine. If I could verify that those things would work on linux I think I'd switch and say goodbye to windows forever.

<br />
<br />Sadly, I've realized that there were no accurate nes emulator with debugging options. As I don't like to use Wine, I've installed a virtual machine with Windows XP.
<br />It works well, and the only problem I've found so far is that the nes sound is really bad (so i muted it).
<br />
<br />I use Virtual Box.

You will have to tinker with it to do what you want it to do, however if you do something stupid like delete /dev/hda or /dev/sda like I did once... you will be screwed. Irrecoverably.

It would be faster to go ground up using the server distro they have which is just a barebones install, and by then it seems pointless when you could install Debian instead. I also had problems with X crashing. No matter what I did it would eventually crash(just logging in would do it). That said, it is a great distro for first timers to GNU/Linux, but after a while you may want to try something new(Been on Debian for 3-4 years now, Ubuntu for a6 months or so between that and some other ones .

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, I've recently installed Ubuntu linux. I have pretty much all of my NES development stuff up and running, except a debugging emulator. FCEUXDSP 1.07 runs in Wine, but just barely (sound is horrible). Famitracker runs ok in wine, but only on the lowest possible sound quality (which is not a problem for me) I was able to compile &amp; run Nestopia and FCEUX natively on linux, but neither of these seem to have any debugging facilities, not even the ability to inspect memory. 
<br />
<br />Any linux users care to share how they're able to debug NES programs while developing under linux?
