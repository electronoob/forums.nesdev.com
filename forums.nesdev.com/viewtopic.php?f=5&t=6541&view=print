		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well anyone else have a batch file that opens up all necessary deveopment files? As when I goto work on my programs, it takes FOREVER to find them all in my file folders, then open them with the correct program, then start to compile and such. Well I am making a batch file for it to open up everything I need when working on a game but I am having a problem getting FCEUX to work with it.....I have no idea why, but it just opens up another command prompt 0_o
<br />
<br />
<br />Well here's my file so far first 2 work, but for the 3rd line to even attempt to run you have to close notepad?
<br />
<br />
<br />explorer.exe C:\Documents and Settings\Buba\My Documents\NES Development\CustomGames\Kaboom!
<br />notepad.exe C:\Documents and Settings\Buba\My Documents\NES Development\CustomGames\Kaboom!\Kaboom!.asm
<br />start "C:\Documents and Settings\Buba\My Documents\NES Development\Emulators\FCEUX\FCEUX.exe"
<br />pause
<br />
<br />
<br />Anyone have any idea why FCEUX doesn't work? I've tried it with and without quotes and many other thing so yeahhh.....I have no clue why it doesn't work.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />
<br />
<br />Okay sorry guys, I got it to work. I should have used CALL instead of START? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />Well here's my batch file, if anyone needs hep with maybe making one post here or let us know what yours does? IDK <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />
<br />explorer.exe C:\Documents and Settings\Buba\My Documents\NES Development\CustomGames\Kaboom!
<br />notepad.exe C:\Documents and Settings\Buba\My Documents\NES Development\CustomGames\Kaboom!\Kaboom!.asm
<br />call "C:\Documents and Settings\Buba\My Documents\NES Development\Emulators\FCEUX\fceux.exe"

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If the path is quoted, start.exe assumes that it is the title to display in the window title bar, not the path to the program, and it opens a command prompt with that title. To work around this, add an extra pair of quotation marks before to set the title to nothing.
<br />
<br />Wrong:
<br />C:\Documents and Settings\Pinocchio&gt;start "C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"
<br />
<br />Right:
<br />C:\Documents and Settings\Pinocchio&gt;start "ie" "C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"
<br />
<br />You aren't going to want to "open up everything [you] need when working on a game" once your program grows from one source code file to a dozen. If you want to work on missile movement, for example, you won't want to open a couple files related to CHR decompression and the title screen. Instead, I recommend 1. associating .asm to your editor of choice and then 2. writing a script for GNU Make to reconvert the .png files to .chr, recompile the .asm files, link the whole thing together, and start the emulator.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ahh yes tepples thanks <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I messed up the start command by not having empty double quotes there, I did not realize that it needed them since I never have actually done anything besides simple run one file programs from it.
<br />
<br />
<br />As for now this game will only have one small file so it's all I need and I'm sure other will be able to expand upon it for their needs. I just brought it up because I know others might be tired of opening up all their files seperate.
<br />
<br />
<br />Well now that I got this done I think I'll work on another later to assemble it and run it to the emulator for me,if possible.
<br />
<br />
<br />Also, I don't know anything besides HTML,Javascript, and very very very little command prompt so I have no power/knowledge to create .exe files or any server side or client side stuff besides that sadly <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not sure how related this is, but I like to use the NppExec plugin in Notepad++. You can basically set up batch scripts in there and hook them up with key commands. At the moment, hitting "F9" will build my current project and then run it in Jnes, F10 is Nestopia, F11 builds my rom, creates debug files and runs FCEUXDSP 1.07 (great for debugging),  F12 is Nintendulator.   As for opening all files in the editor related to the project, I generally just leave them open and notepad++ restores the session next time I use it.
<br />
<br />As for trouble making emulators run from a batch script, Notepad++'s NppExec had a couple of hiccups the first few times I used it. It seems to capture all output of any process it starts, including windows, so to make an emulator actually pop up from a script in nppexec I've had to do this (here's my script for FCEUXDSP 1.07):
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">cd $&#40;PROJECT_DIR&#41;<br />make clean<br />make -j2 debug<br />cmd /c &quot;C:\NES\Emulators\fceuxdsp-1_07\fceuxdsp $&#40;PROJECT_OUTPUT&#41;&quot;<br /></div><br /><br />BTW, I have another script in there called "Set Project Vars" which sets the couple of environment variables you see there. I have it set up to run any time I run notepad++. So, if I want to switch what project I work on, typically it is a matter of changing one word in the Set Project Vars script, after hitting F6. Very convenient! Here's the Set Project Vars script&#058;<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">set PROJECT_NAME = nomolos<br />set PROJECTS_DIR = C:\NES\Projects<br />set TOOLS_DIR = C:\NES\Tools<br />set PROJECT_DIR = $&#40;PROJECTS_DIR&#41;\$&#40;PROJECT_NAME&#41;<br />set PROJECT_OUTPUT = $&#40;PROJECT_NAME&#41;.nes<br />set GRAPHICS_EDITOR = $&#40;TOOLS_DIR&#41;\Graphics\NESGraphicsEditor\NESGraphicsEditor.exe<br />set LEVEL_EDITOR = $&#40;TOOLS_DIR&#41;\Graphics\NESLevelEditor\NESLevelEditor.exe<br />set MUSIC_EDITOR = $&#40;TOOLS_DIR&#41;\sound\ft_v030\FamiTracker.exe<br /></div>
<br />
<br />I have key shortcuts setup for running the graphics editor, level editor, and Famitracker. Having all these things makes Notepad++ feel like an IDE for NES development!
