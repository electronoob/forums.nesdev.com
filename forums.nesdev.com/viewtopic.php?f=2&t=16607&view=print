Sometimes just replacing some capacitors helps; sometimes more is necessary.

I fixed it by hooking the RF cable up to my TV (even if I wasn't actually using it, as I was using composite output for video).<br />I think what was happening was that the extra connection to the TV helped the console being a little bit better &quot;grounded&quot;.

Another PPU, another Q1. previously I had tried another Power box and changing all non ceramic caps<br /><br />I think @lidnariq might be into something. I have disoldered PPU a13 and the jail bars were completely gone, (even though the image was logically badly broken. I have followed a13 to a resistor array i have changed but still no effect.<br /><br /><br />I’m not sure what more I can do but I feel I’m missing something really simple. Any idea ?<br /><br />Thanks ,<br /><br />Romi
