<br />
<br />My first impression would be no but I just want to confirm before I launch myself into this.  There is many different type of cartridge that I can salvage from hardware shop in the junk section for 30/100 yen (especially baseball game... there must be millions of them here) that I guess I can find all kind of mapper combination if I look properly.

<br />
<br />We could always confirm it since I do have Rockman 2. As long as I don't have to break the sticker on it, I wouldn't mind to open it and take a picture.
<br />
<br />What I forgot to mention is I want use it mostly for development but I may want to reproduce a few cart that never came to Japan. For example, game like Kick master, Rollergames, low-g-man, strider etc. Ok, not all of them are great game but I can't buy them here and would love to try it again in a non emulated form (the worst is that I had all of them.. I should have never sold my american cart collection before moving here).  Is there any restriction to make reproduction cart from an american game on a famicom cart?

<br />Great! Now I just need to go hunting for generic baseball carts with the mapper I'm interested in and get wild then  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> 
<br />
<br />But, regarding the repro-carts, japanese cart have extra hardware that limit which one will work properly in an american one because of an extra sound chip or something similar.  I don't think there is any issue the other way around?  Except I read one part about the nes has a raw mode for sound that the famicom doesn't have. Could that be an issue with a few games that I may be interested to make available in a famicom format or some coding that I could do?

<br />The consoles are for all practical purposes identical, and it's even easier to make Famicom carts because there isn't a lockout chip.

<br />
<br />Sorry, my comment was not clear at all. I write a little bit too fast because I'm doing it during some break time at work.
<br />
<br />Great, for repro-cart the process is the same, thank you for confirming it.  What I meant is if there is any american game that are not compatible on the famicom? I guess not since the famicom came first? 
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />Worst case I just buy a nes-to-famicom adapter (if I can find one) and buy the game back.  I want mostly to use the cart as a dev cart anyway.  To play a few game I cannot get here was just a plus.

<br />Perhaps the games that require a non-standard controller (e.g. Miracle Piano) or a Four Score accessory (e.g. Smash TV) because those differ between the Famicom and the NES.

I can't remember if the famicom lightguns would work with a US game either. But without add-ons, they should work fine. Nintendo used the same circuit board types--just in different formats.

<br />I guess the information about the rom pinout must be on the wiki? For now I found the one regarding the mappers, cpu , ppu etc but not the rom.  I will try to search more, I must have not looked at the right place.
