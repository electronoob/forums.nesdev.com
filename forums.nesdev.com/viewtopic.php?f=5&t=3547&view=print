<br />
<br />What is quite clear is that the only place known on the net to host things like LandyNES is an in-accessible directory, due to it being on a private directory since 1996. 
<br />
<br />Best chance is to find an FTP site at this point.  Most "Internet" sources are useless now for most of those.  Of course us emu-collector types have lots of stash from the day <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />It is fascinating how some of these emulator projects started out.

<br />
<br />The whole reason I want to see LandyNes in action, is that it isn't available anywhere normal on the net, it has this whole legendary story yet you cannot try it out. With Landy working with Marat on the whole creation of the iNES format I want to see how he interpreted it in his emulator attempt.
<br />
<br />Of course I have not tried contacting them.  Most authors of single works have a long history of losing their work due to things like hardware failures.  Besides, the chase is what makes it so exciting <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />on the topic of this guy's older emulators, what the hell is up with this?
<br />
<br />i think byuu(?) said once on rhdn there was a version of super pasofami that would just shit all over the windows installation if it wasn't a japanese version or something equally insane.
<br />
<br />anyway, i really like reading about the really early emulaiton scene although there doesn't seem to be many pages on the topic.  seems that alot of the early authors were in it for the money haha.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It may be Super PasoFami that I'm remembering and not Pasowing.
<br />
<br />The program would delete the entire contents of your C:\WINDOWS directory if it detected that it had been cracked.  I don't remember the technical details of how it determined that, but my guess is that it had a self-CRC check and if the internal CRC it compared against wasn't changed along with the crack, it would nuke C:\WINDOWS.
<br />
<br />And yes, many people got bit by this.
<br />
<br />There's also some emulators and tools for console development stuff which are Japanese-only in the sense that the author(s) do not want them made available to non-Japanese individuals.  There's entire Limewire-like services which do the same thing (deny access to everything except for network blocks that are verified to be in Japan).  I can't say it's a form of racism, but it is a form of discrimination.  I don't pass judgement on some Japanese being this way either -- why not?  Try to imagine what would happen to something like Nico Nico Douga once Americans got access to it -- in a matter of days it'd become like Youtube and SomethingAwful combined.

<br />By the way, there's an emulator you're missing: VeNES, which Mr. Snazz and I worked on.  Wikipedia states it's "unreleased", but Mr. Snazz did release it on his website some years back:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.joshmckee.com/~jmc/shoebox/venes/" class="postlink">http://www.joshmckee.com/~jmc/shoebox/venes/</a>
<br />
<br />But don't blame me if it doesn't work -- Borland Pascal had <a href="http://www.brain.uni-freiburg.de/~klaus/pascal/runerr200/" class="postlink">this wonderful bug</a> where it would crash (divide by zero error) on machines with bus speeds &gt;33MHz (e.g. 486 DX/50).
<br />
<br />I'll have to edit Wikipedia with a link.  :-)
