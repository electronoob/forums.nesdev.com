It's really tedious to check the several byte values against the data for example in the Bootgod database.<br />So, if there isn't a program that can correct the header automatically per ROM, is there at least a list of the &quot;original&quot; headers for each game, so that I can compare the values 1:1?

What's so bad about using bootgod anyway?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I know that the headers aren't part of the original ROM. But that doesn't change the fact that there are right and wrong headers, right? I mean, the real world physical &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; cartridge is set to vertical mirroring. If the header in the ROM file has the value for horizontal mirroring, then the header is obviously wrong. Not wrong from a purely technical point of view, but wrong in relation to the real cartridge.<br /><br />I guess general cleaning (for example replacing the string &quot;DISKDUDE&quot; with zero values) wouldn't be enough here. The tool would need to know the actual data for each specific game.<br /><br />Using Bootgod isn't bad per se. It's more the general dislike of having to manually go through a bunch of ROMs and check their headers. Especially if you're not that fluent in headers and the Bootgod website merely provides the human-readable data. You have to convert it in your mind: &quot;O.k., the game has horizontal mirroring. What values was that again? Zero or one? Oh yeah, zero. Alright, next value: What was that byte good for again? I have to check the documentation again.&quot; You know what I mean? It's tedious and error-prone.<br /><br />There is a program that helps you to find out which ROMs you have, renaming them. I.e. the program knows the hash value of every ROM in existance. Why isn't there a similar program for fixing the header? If GoodNES can find out that your &quot;smb.nes&quot; is &quot;Super Mario Bros. (JU) (No Title Hack)&quot;, why isn't there a program that can tell you that the header in your file doesn't correspond to what the game really was like?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree that there are right and wrong headers, as we've defined them.  I was just taking exception to your use of the word &quot;original.&quot;<br /><br />There's absolutely nothing stopping a bootgod backed header cleaning application from being created; it just hasn't been done yet (to my knowledge).<br /><br />You CAN use the goodnes data to fix headers, and there is a program that does this already.  I'm not terribly familiar with the internals of goodnes, but look for something called &quot;fixnes&quot;?  The goodnes data is not as accurate as more current bootgod data; but it encompasses more things than bootgod does.

Do you have something like that? (Because otherwise, having no time to write a program would be the least problem. I guess having no time to manually write down the header data of 1000+ games would be much more of an issue.)<br /><br />If you can send me the header data in any format or tell me where to find it, I might write such a tool.
