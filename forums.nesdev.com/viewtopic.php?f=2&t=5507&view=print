		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was playing through this game recently and was impressed by some of its special effects (not to mention that the game is a pretty solid isometric shooter in its own right).  There are two effects in particular that I wanted to point out.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJiCi1f1SXE" class="postlink">This youtube clip</a> contains both:
<br />
<br />- Around 1:55, the background begins to move in a sinusoidal pattern.
<br />- Around 4:05, the boss (which looks great) tears apart and seems to 'smear' the graphics between the two halves.
<br />
<br />So, any input on how these effects were achieved?  Any similar examples from other NES games?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Isolated Warrior is TLROM, which has an MMC3 chip.
<br />
<br />The sinusoidal pattern is probably timed writes to the horizontal scroll register. The MMC3 scanline counter makes it easier: put in the number of the scanlines until the next time X is supposed to change, and the mapper will trigger an IRQ.
<br />
<br />Tearing apart is likewise writes to the scroll register, resetting the VRAM address . You can tell it's using the MMC3 scanline counter because a pattern repeats every 2 scanlines. (This mapper's counter can't trigger on successive lines.)

<br />Not many games where the fourth boss is harder than the fifth through seventh combined.

<br />The NES equivalent to the C64's FPP (Flexible Pixel Position), which is used to place lines wherever you want them, including repeating them. Once again much easier with more than 8 pixels of hardware scroll.

<br />Like mentioned above, once you lose your power up.. The game became quite hard.

<br />Isolated Warrior always was pretty impressive, technically, and it looks a lot like Recca in terms of design.  So, after a little checking, <a href="http://gdri.smspower.org/wiki/index.php/Company:KID" class="postlink">it's true</a> since they had the same developer.
<br />
<br />KID-developed games always had a unique art style, and many were also impressive programming efforts.  (I have no idea where they went wrong on Low-G Man, however.)
