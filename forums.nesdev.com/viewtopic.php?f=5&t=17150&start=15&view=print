Sometimes it's just impossible to get along with another person, the problem might be you, it might be them, it might be a combination of both.  The best solution is just to ignore it -  even if you wanted to make it &quot;right&quot;, nothing you do or say will truly fix things.<br /><br />In the end, it's the internet, you can't expect everybody to like you. (especially when you consider how readily people will start badmouthing others on the internet, yay for anonymity.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'll come out of the woodwork to say that I'm extremely thankful for the research, development, projects, and just how this place has been a valuable resource for the silly hobby of programming a 30 year old game console.<br /><br />I've had my differences though, and there's been plenty of &quot;really guys?&quot; moments and &quot;yep, not touching this one&quot; moments. I don't agree with &quot;burn it down and salt the earth&quot; though, nor singling out one user and/or one thread and making a sweeping generalization about everyone who's contributed here.<br /><br />About my reply, my criticism was that I couldn't understand some of the behaviors around here, yet they were considered &quot;normal&quot;. Understanding that we're a bunch of nerds here and probably aren't experts in communication nor social interactions/issues is what got me past that. Saying that the community is &quot;thankless&quot; is unfair, I know, but that's really how I felt when all I wanted to do was help out and it appeared that nobody was paying any mind. Maybe I was going overboard and giving advice when it wasn't called for, but it feels bad to repeatedly feel like you're being brushed off, you know?<br /><br />I don't have any qualms about this place, and I don't have any issues with Xkeeper. I meant it when I said I ignored eccentricities and focused on the projects and development related things, that combined with the &quot;understanding&quot; from earlier is what helped me feel better.

Even tepples is doing the pronouns thing.
