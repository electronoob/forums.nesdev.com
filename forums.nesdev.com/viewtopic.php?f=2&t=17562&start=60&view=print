Less or no financial involvement, ease of distributing versions. <br /><br />and of course, at that price point you’re bound to filter out a good deal of casual NES owners unless the game really hits a string within that demographic.<br /><br />The PAL region might be maybe 10-20% (guesstimate) of your cartridge market, which isn't all that much, but it aint getting bigger if you ignore it. And it's a lot less work than doing a famicom release (where the thread started).

But if you want to play your NES games at the correct speed, you get an NTSC NES. &quot;Retro gamers&quot; for whom it matters have known this for decades. For the rest, they don't care anyway.

Timed code is a main culprit to look out for. Emphasis bits is another, since someone thought it was brilliant to switch red and green. I explored ways to make palette animations smoother for a horror game for Orab. Just using all bits, and/or just the blue bit in tandem with palette compensations works great for lights on/off. <img src="https://frankengraphics.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/lightsonoffdemonstration.gif" alt="Image" />  But if i wanted to use the red bit for sunset coming through a window or warning signals, that'd require a region detection feature. <br /><br />For game speed compensation, see the Project Blue case. Games are variably better or worse at the slower PAL speed. Most are fine/good enough. Castlevania works because of on/off movement. Super Mario Bros. works because of open space, relatively free range movement, scrolling, and that the player is mostly either at max running speed. Project Blue has a *lot* of roadblocks, turns of direction, wait for the right moment tricks, no scrolling, screen switching - that you're riding the de/acceleration curve far more than SMB. They're kind of in opposite ends in that matter. Note that both these games initially had the exact same acceleration curve before PB got snappier + got the physics tweaked to fit both NTSC and PAL. SMB feels alright, but PB was initially more noticeably slow.<br /><br /><br />btw it's not all that dark for PAL. Whenever a game runs out of Vblank on NTSC is a moment where PAL excels.. provided the software doesn't forcibly cancel updates under the assumption of the Vblank being &quot;NTSC narrow&quot;. Again in project Blue, you sometimes run out of bandwidth during the boss fights on level 1A &amp; 1B, due to the numerous bullets, causing some visual artifacts. Not so on PAL; it's stable as a rock.

In my experience, a buffer spanning the unused part of the stack page, such as $0108-$01BF, happens to be about the right size to fill NTSC vblank, and there isn't a lot of RAM in the system to store a bigger buffer. So a bigger buffer would likely need to be stored either in ROM (such as copying uncompressed tiles) or in WRAM at $6000. Where are you storing the source data for an update buffer bigger than 192 bytes?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some updates don't need a buffer, such as patterns that go straight from the ROM to VRAM. Things that are constantly animating, such as the player and the background, will most likely not use compression, so you can copy them directly, instead of wasting time and space copying them to a buffer first.<br /><br />Another example is my raycaster, which renders columns as fast as it can, and during vblank, as many columns as possible are copied to VRAM. The bigger is larger than what can be copied in one NTSC vblank, so the renderer doesn't need to be stalled, which would cause slowdown. PAL consoles can make even better use of the larger buffer by uploading more data (the whole buffer, in fact) to VRAM each frame.<br /><br />My VRAM update system keeps track of how much buffer space is left, as well as how much time is left. Space is the same for NTSC and PAL, but the time is significantly increased for PAL, so that updates that don't need much buffer space can take advantage of it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm honestly not quite sure what makes the PB boss fights on level 1 solid on a PAL NES, or what nmi/main topology it is using. I have never bothered asking for a look at the source. I'm just assuming that since NMI strikes less frequently, game logic manages to finish up all the metasprite handling before the OAM buffer is uploaded, even in more crowded scenarii. Mostly, rooms are designed to avoid sprites flashing up in the wrong places on NTSC, but there are a few exceptions where other goals were prioritized. This game doesn't need to update the nametable frame for frame since it doesn't scroll, and all bg animations are palette based. <br /><br />Tokumarus' example sounds like the ideal NTSC/PAL-aware implementation for NT updates, though. <br /><br />Else, wRAM isn't costly (~1$?), and might be an option if you're thinking about blowing the internal RAM budget anyway or about having battery saves (~1-2$ for battery and battery clip?).

The issue here isn't the PAL standard, but the fact that PAL was always second fiddle to NTSC on the video games market.

A cart that works with both is a useful thing in this situation. (It's also good for the user who doesn't know the difference.)<br /><br />The situtation for us here and now is a lot different than Nintendo in the 80s, where they controlled distribution pretty tightly and were actively working to maintain region locking (which was an important component of their business strategy). Multi-region detection <em>is</em> an anti-region-locking device; there would definitely be no encouragement from Nintendo for any licensed developer to do this.<br /><br /><br />PAL vs NTSC (vs Dendy) <em>is</em> something that is very reasonable to detect, IMO, and seems it can be done robustly across clones and emulators too. The test strongly correlates, and isn't particularly prone to error. (Mainly because CPU overclocking isn't much of a thing with NES and its clones, since it breaks so many games.)<br /><br />Maybe worth pointing out though that the only thing typically done with a PAL/NTSC detection is directly related to the <em>thing you detected</em>. You measure the <em>framerate</em>, and you do something to compensate for that <em>framerate</em>. It's pretty much worthless for determining tangentially related things like language, for instance.</div>I fully agree!<br />Although I think it may be a good idea to give the user options to manually set the flags you use to compensate these things, in case the user is using a setup not covered by the detection routine somehow. For example can you test things like emphasis flags? I don't know if all UMC-based Famiclones are using PAL emphasis or if only the PAL ones (like Dendy and Pegasus) do. Then there is the RGB PPU that I'm not sure if it can be detected at all.<br />If the game isn't using any way to save it might get tiresome to set the options every time you start the game though.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Timed code is a main culprit to look out for.

NTSC NES, Famicom, PAL NES and Dendy seem to be mostly consistent, though there are some rarer but official RGB variations of the PPU which implement emphasis in a very different manner too. Other clones, who knows, and also a <em>lot</em> of emulators don't have different emphasis colour for PAL. (I suspect there are quite a few emulators that don't implement emphasis at all, actually.)<br /><br />Since there's no direct feedback of this information from the PPU itself, I agree the most appropriate thing is to ask the user. It's very common in modern games to do gamma correction configured by the user on first play. &quot;Adjust the brightness until (something) is barely visible.&quot;<br /><br />Since flash ROM is common, you might be able to use this to save settings, though you have to give up a whole block to that save ability (depends on flash type, maybe 4k).
