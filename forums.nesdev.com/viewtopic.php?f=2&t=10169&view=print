Such as the memory map, registers, descriptions of the CPU (that it's basically a 6502 without decimal mode), PPU (general graphics info), and APU (general info about the sound hardware).<br /><br />It's unlikely there was any development kit as we would imagine one today. Just basic information. Probably among the programming relevant info would have been some hardware info like a cartridge pinout. <br /><br />Other developers were known to make their own pc programmable dev boards.

Everything else is just speculation.  There are articles/interviews online with Famicom (not NES) developers if you want to read those; they're about as good as it gets.  There are some articles/interviews on NESWorld as well, but with smaller developers.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">hugemikeyd wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Did Nintendo provide any hardware/software for this? How about any manuals/documentation?</div><br />I'm under the impression Nintendo did give out some kind of software (I think I read somewhere about them providing an assembler and that's it) -- not sure about hardware -- but it was very sub-par in quality, causing the majority (80-90%?) of companies to write their own.  Since you mention Capcom, it's safe to say you're wanting to know about the &quot;big boys&quot; -- all developed their own tools.<br /><br />Regarding manuals and documentation: yes, documentation was provided.  I have only seen a single page of the documentation issued to developers in the United States, and it was atrocious (a very, very bad Japanese-&gt;English translation job; I'm under the impression it was done by Nintendo of Japan, by someone of Japanese descent who had a very basic (and bad) grasp of English).  Remember: everything back then tended to be done hastily and with severe monetary focus (especially when it came to hardware: ICs were expensive).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">hugemikeyd wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I know folks have reverse engineered several processes to homebrew today, but I was curious what it was like back in the day.</div><br />Many companies did reverse-engineering back then as well, and I'm not just referring to Color Dreams, Tengen, etc..  I imagine there was a **lot** of &quot;try this and see what happens&quot; type of development as well -- similar to reverse-engineering but by trial and error.

Sunsoft did a lot of their graphics editing directly on the Famicom w/ a TV!

The development teams weren't near as big as I would have previously thought.  It does present a stumbling block if a coder can't draw, but at least you don't have to be able to write music.  It would probably help to have making games as your day job, but who needs sleep anyways?

Typing (and editing) takes a lot of time, and it's a lot easier to just have a small office space with small rooms (with doors on them) where people can work, or yap with one another when needed.  Online, there's just too many distractions, IMO.

The original NES developers didn't have such a music/sound engine available to them. They had to make it. Similarly there are graphical editors we have that they didn't. And in general computers are better, and we have emulators with debuggers.

Far as I can make out, it seems to be similar to a CopyNES, but made from discreet logic. And it makes me wonder what other designs for 'homebrew' hardware developers back then came up with. No standardized kits, not exactly the great wealth of info we have available today, they must've had to get quite creative.
