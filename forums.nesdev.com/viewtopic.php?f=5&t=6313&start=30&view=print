He is either ignoring what we say or he really has some sort of cognitive dysfunction.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So I guess he either gave up before trying, or is too attached to the misguided notion that someone else is somehow going to program it for him.</div>
<br />I don't think he is willing to go as far as learning to code himself, his mind is really set on finding someone to do the dirty work for him. Maybe if he actually started learning how to code he'd realize how far-fetched his goals are.
<br />
<br />Honestly, to me it doesn't look like he is capable on focusing on something as much as is needed for programming, so I don't think he has what it takes to be a coder. Actually, he doesn't look very smart either.

<br />- A NES ROM maker would be AWESOME, DUDE
<br />- An awesome thing gets plenty of donations
<br />- Money is the only thing you need to get things done, so someone will code this for all the money I'll get from donors
<br />- Voil√†, I present you to the NES ROM maker!
<br />(Dark secret real objective: I can easily plagiarize the NES games I like without a single assembly line woo hoo)
