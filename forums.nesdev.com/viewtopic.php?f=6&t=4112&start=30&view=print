<br />
<br />1. You didn't include stages music tracks in the package. ^_^;;
<br />2. As I said, you should apply the FE (or FF) to stop the music. Some game transitions become weird if you don't do this... but fine.
<br />3. Think about creating an INI file to save custom tracks. The user could change the default music track by another file, it would be cool.
<br />4. The next "natural" step would be gfx enhancement...

<br />
<br />1. Well, under the circumstances, I really <em>couldn't</em>.  The intention from the beginning was to release this directly to The Megas and their fans...and I'm sure they wouldn't be too happy with me distributing pirated copies of the album.  Given that that was the target audience, though, there really wasn't a problem, because everyone would have their own legal copy.
<br />2. I still can't think of any particular examples in game at all...if you were to try to apply these techniques to another game, that might be an issue, but in MM2, one ends when another starts.
<br />3. Probably a good idea, as far as generalizing the code goes.
<br />4. Gfx is a whole other ballpark, really, I'll let someone more experienced try to tackle something like that.
