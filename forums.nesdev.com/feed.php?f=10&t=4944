Hey guys ok well i decided to sell off my original panesian games, and i want to have a copy of each just to play. i have successfully made reproductions of super contra 7, super mario 2 jap. But thats about all the dev experience i have. got into it about 2 years ago then took a long break. Anyways im back now trying to learn alot about it and these are the next games i wanna try and figure out how to make for a little project i wanna work on. (dont worry they wont look anything like the originals, im a collector as well so i like to keep the integrity of the hobby. <br /><br />Anyways. So Ok i only found one thread about this that taskforce posted, and some say it can defintely be done with a Cnrom board. So i got that covered but now thats about all i know. so a few big questions to get me started&gt;<br /><br />1. To do this cart will it need to have a PRG and CHR split on each chip and mirrored up.?<br />2. Do i need any additional parts besides my eproms (512kb) 32 pin eproms,  Eprom programmer (willems) , wire, wolder, solder pump etc.<br />3. Is there any step by steps on this anywhere?? or would someone be nice enough to do a step by step for me, (in dummy terms that is lol)<br /><br />BTW yes i know you can get pirate booty at retrousb and i think thats cool but i wanna have them on separate carts cause i wanna make a little custom made cart for them. <br /><br />Any advice would be so awesome.<br />thanks everyone!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2262">parpunk</a> â€” Thu Mar 12, 2009 9:12 am</p><hr />
