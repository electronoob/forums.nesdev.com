Replied to help, but nothing really forward after that...)<br /><br />Since around a month, I started to work on it again, with proper timing information etc...etc...<br />My goals are multiple :<br />- Put it in open source.<br />- Have the code *as clean as possible* for anybody to maintain, proper documentation of trick or implementation details.<br />- Not bloated implementation. Minimalist.<br />- May be able to use the EXT port and create a nice modern extension for existing console. (For that, my implementation is currently limited to the DOT CLOCK. I plan to use DDR pumping to output the Hires512 mode)<br /><br />Language used is VHDL. I noticed that other user on the forum have started their implementation too, they are welcome to contact me.<br /><br />It will probably always be a *in progress* work, as documentation can always be improved, but anybody could do it from the source, or find issue and update the doc and the implementation.<br />Same for optimization or removal of redundant logic. For now things are getting pretty good.<br />I am entering the debug phase, my first goal is having first most of it working and then fine tune the details.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope I am welcome here, and also hope to get the support from people around here about various details.<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br />Laxer3A

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah... But I will wait until I get something fully functionnal until release or if I get fed up, at least it wont be lost.<br />(As I wrote earlier, putting it open source hasn't resulted in anything before...)<br /><br />I have some questions (from many to come).<br /><br />1/ I do remember somehow that sprites(Objects) are NOT displayed during the first scanline, am I correct ?<br />(I just browsed the Snes9X code, is like : int startline = (IPPU.InterlaceOBJ &amp;&amp; GFX.InterlaceFrame) ? 1 : 0; )<br />And also, is it the same during interlace ?<br /><br />2/ From the second scanline (BG Y=1), is the sprite line 1 is displayed or line 0 ? (lag of one line in coordinate)<br /><br />But would be better to have an accurate and straight answer instead of writing test program / look at source code of emulators...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Line 0 is used to initialize the sprite engine. Before HBlank the sprites for line 1 are determined, and during HBlank their tiles are loaded from VRAM. Neither sprites nor backgrounds are displayed in line 0.<br /><br />Afaik when a background has a vertical scroll value of 0, its first line would've been in screen line 0, but is skipped because line 0 is not displayed. I'd guess the same goes for sprites.

(No BG 1/2) Pixel reversed (H Flip not implemented + wrong pixel decoding order (stupid self, duh !)<br />- Fix pixel order.<br />(-Fix bug in tool that did not dump correctly the scroll register, was pointing to wrong map area)<br />- Desactivate pixel computation pipeline. (So implementation is shutoff to check that ALL pixels are coming.<br />- Fix bug in priority logic.<br /><br /><br />So here is the list of known bug yet not fixed for now :<br />- Loading state machine generate some glitch, that would explain the buggy tiles.<br />- Pixel pipeline is not working fully properly.<br /><br />Let's see if I can keep the pace of fixing the glitch.<br />Hope you enjoy the progress as much as I do <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
