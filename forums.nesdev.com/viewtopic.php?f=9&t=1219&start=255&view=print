<br />
<br />I was looking at the die pics and was figuring out what was an input and what was an output pin.  That's when I noticed that pins 3 and 4 were inputs, while the other 8 "unused" pins were outputs.  I then traced those outputs to the ROM address lines and other various places, via 2 to 1 muxers.  The rest kinda fell into place from there.  I think Loopy figured out pin 4 was the output enable for those 8 pins.
<br />
<br />With dumps of the internal state as it executed, we were well on the way.

<br />
<br />Yeah... might be a good idea to look anyways.  We've gone through just about every other region and checked now.  The other region in question is Korea, but I suspect they use a 3196 like HK and the "asian version" does.

<br />
<br />Yeah, I meant the 3193 and 3195 appear to use the same algo as each other... with a changed constant or two in the initial hashing loop to set up the seeds, before the 4 bit word is transferred from the lock to the key.
<br />
<br />So it looks like 3195 is PAL B, and 3197 is PAL A.   That just leaves 3194 as the big unknown.

<br />That's great. So both of them can definitely be included in a single MCU, that would act like a 3193, and if a reset signal is send a bit later act like a 3195 or something like that.
<br />I think if we could put all 3193, 3195 and 3197 in a single MCU it would be just great ! I don't think 3196 are very common anywhere (since all asian countries uses pirated famiclones instead), and I really don't see how anyone would have use of a famicombox today (with that stupid coin counter). BTW I don't understand why famicombox games were written specially for it... It's not famicom games anymore, if you see what I mean.

Either I'm doing something wrong (quite likely, as I don't have much confidence in what I'm doing at the moment), or the algorithm timing does not match, in which case the algorithm must have changed.  If the algorithm changed, the log data will be virtually useless without a dump of the ROM and better knowledge of the hardware.
<br />
<br />I'm hoping I made a mistake here, as I'd much rather see the algorithm unchanged (in which case we easily have enough data to determine the seeds, through brute force if nothing else).
<br />
<br />EDIT - It was my mistake.  The timing is actually the same for the 3195, so at least that much of the algorithm was left unchanged.  Hopefully the rest is unchanged as well....

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I decided to try to crack the "lock" seed (the one in $11-1F, which stays constant regardless of the 4-bit initialization transfer) using a brute-force attack.  I only had the program do a small number of hashes (around 8 or so), and to stop if it found more than one match.  It didn't take long for a match to be found, and almost immediately thereafter a second one showed up.  So I figured I needed a larger data set.  I kept adding transmission details (ignoring timing, since I'm only doing one seed by itself), and I kept getting the same results - the same two matches showed up over and over with each test.
<br />
<br />I then added a piece of code to output the initial seed and the result of the first hash, as well as the number of cycles required on the actual CIC to complete the job.  It turned out both seeds took the same amount of time to hash, and both yielded the exact same result as well.  No wonder I wasn't able to narrow down the results by adding additional data.
<br />
<br />I may later scan all possible seeds to see how many yield the correct result, and if any take a different amount of time (again, I can't verify accurate timing at this point because I'm only doing half the work the real CIC does).  I can verify at the moment that at least 8 different initial seeds can be used, all of which take the same amount of time to hash.
<br />
<br />The eight seeds are:
<br />1. $17BEF0AF5706617
<br />2. $17BED2AF5706617
<br />3. $17BEB4AF5706617
<br />4. $17BE96AF5706617
<br />5. $17BE78AF5706617
<br />6. $17BE5AAF5706617
<br />7. $17BE3CAF5706617
<br />8. $17BE1EAF5706617
<br />
<br />The result of the first hash is $6EF162D81783986.
<br />
<br />Can someone double-check these results?  There have been times before when I've made a really dumb mistake in coding that yielded faulty results.
