<br />1) Because I don't do parallel ports any more.  The year is (nearly) 2010, not 1991.  I'm not going to deal with direct I/O "passthrough" drivers/SYS/DLLs on Windows either.  USB or nothing -- and yes, I've worked with it (USB stacks, that is).
<br />
<br />2) It's difficult to discern if the software is really up to snuff.  If I remember right, a large portion of it is based on QBasic... come on.

<br />Hmm... I'm a little confused at how this actually works.  Well, that is to say, I understand what the device *does*, but I'm confused as to how one would, say, use it to develop an MMC3 game for example.

<br />
<br />Nah -- I have no real problem with EPROMs, just that I've been down that road when it comes to development and it's tedious; a lot of wasted time, especially when debugging is required.
<br />
<br />My point is that it's 2010 and overall development tools/processes should have improved.  Just because we're working on a device from 1986 doesn't mean we have to do development like back then.  :-)

<br />
<br />For MMC3 you would have to make a RAM cart (easy) and uploader plug in (easy).  For many simple mappers and MMC1 I have the <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=24&amp;products_id=35" class="postlink">PowerPak Lite</a>.  Then just like the Quickdev16 you just upload your game over USB and play within seconds.  
<br />
<br />A separate USB RAM cart would be a benefit for easy installation, but then the mappers problem hits.

<br />Has anyone implemented this successfully?  I always assumed the powerpak lite was the only cart compatible.  Then again, I haven't done a whole lot of research on the project.  All I've seen is what is on the product page.  
<br />
<br />I probably would have considered a copynes sooner if I knew you could make other mappers supported.

<br />In that case, would it be possible to add a built-in USB CF reader to another version of the PowerPak, in much the same way that the EFA flash card for GBA has a USB port on it?

<br />
<br />Several years ago I made a cart that supports UNROM, for 256kB FlashROM that works with CopyNES.  kevtris wrote a plugin for it.  I imagine that plugin should work with the USB version as well, but I haven't tried it yet.  I have the parts for those, so I could always supply those as kits or built ones if there was enough interest.  But the PowerPak Lite would be better for development, writing Flash is much slower than SRAM.
<br />
<br />I had a ROM emulator before I had a CopyNES, so I never really used it for development.  What really bugged me was the idea of having to navigate through a GUI to program the cartridge, I'd rather have a command-line program.
<br />
<br />Back to the original topic though, that Quickdev16 looks awesome.  That is the best approach for a devcart, on the NES though everyone gets tripped up by the mappers.  So I think a seperate ROM emulator makes good sense for NES, since there are some many different boards.
