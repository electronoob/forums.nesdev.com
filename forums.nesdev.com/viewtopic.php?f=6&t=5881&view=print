		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I didn't really know how to phrase this
<br />
<br />but basically what I am asking is
<br />
<br />for NSFs, has anyone made a tracklisting telling what certain tracks are, and/or what stages they are from?
<br />
<br />I have had requests on YouTube to make Xexyz videos, for example, but the problem is, I don't know what stages the different music are from without playing through the game - which is obviously not possible without much time and frustration (that game is rather difficult!)
<br />
<br />any information on this is appreciated, and if it's not possible, I apologize for asking
<br />
<br />this would be a cool project for someone to undertake, though
<br />
<br />
<br />edit:  I did a little more searching, and found out about NSFE files, but don't know much about these
<br />
<br />I am going to google NSFE and figure out some more about it, but any help is much appreciated <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />another edit:  I think I figured out pretty much all I need to know about Xexyz in particular after doing a little research
<br />
<br />but someone tell me how to use NSFe files - can you do it in winamp?
<br />
<br />if I figure that out, you can just delete this thread <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />
<br />There is the NSFE archive here - <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://slickproductions.org/nsfe.php">http://slickproductions.org/nsfe.php</a><!-- m -->
<br />but it hasn't been updated in a while and I've tagged a bunch of stuff since then.  You'll find everything I've done here -

<br />
<br />You can also check <a href="http://theshizz.org/forum/index.php?/topic/24425-nsfe-collection/page__st__120__p__747256&amp;#entry747256" class="postlink">these</a> <a href="http://theshizz.org/forum/index.php?/topic/24425-nsfe-collection/page__st__180__p__775924&amp;#entry775924" class="postlink">couple</a> posts, because it includes more tags done by a friend as well (and shows what isn't up yet on the archive). If you have any more tracklist requests let me know, we can always use suggestions for things to tag.
<br />
<br />Oh and if you see any repeats, grab our versions because they will be improved / fixed versions of something older from slickproductions. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />needless to say, I'm currently going through a phase <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />my next project is possibly going to be the game Stinger, which I'm currently digging up information on
<br />
<br />I haven't found a NSFe file for that in your links, but I'll keep looking around 
<br />
<br />if there isn't one, I'll just watch a speedrun and try to figure out which music is which

<br />
<br />Yeah, for making an NSFE, I often look to see if there is an existing playthrough of the game. Most of the time though I just wind up playing through a game anyways. Although this is usually pretty easy to figure out, a runthrough may not show secret / bonus areas, game overs, life lost jingles, alternate good / bad endings... stuff like that. It's also always a good idea to double check gamefaqs and see if a game has a sound test. Sometimes you can dig up official track titles that way. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />If you come up with any track lists, be sure to let me know the titles and track order you come up with.

<br />
<br />I left out the game over and pause themes (and one other theme, I think that was too short, I felt, to be included in the video list)
