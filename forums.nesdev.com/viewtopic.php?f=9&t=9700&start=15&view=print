Are any components besides the ICs necessary? It would be nice to do this with minimal modifications to the NES itself. We obviously need to unground the EXT pins and connect them to the board, but I'm unsure of what kind of modifications would be necessary to decode the address as necessary (and there's also the possibility of &quot;bankswitching&quot; the slave PPU so it can make use of the sprite DMA).

You could basically create a whole new PPU, with several background planes, sprites, rotation... The only drawback would be the 4bpp result. Still, I think that a 16-color image could look more colorful than a 25-color one with the severe color distribution restrictions the NES has. It would still be possible for the master PPU to overlay some sprites on top of it all, and one large object/boss using the background.<br /><br />I wonder if the master PPU still lets EXT pixels go through when rendering is disabled... If this is the case, you could update at least 4 palette entries per scanline and have a more colorful picture.<br /><br />But I guess this rout is just too hardcore. I imagine that a device that syncs to the PPU and generates a whole picture would be pretty hard to make, specially with all those graphical features. Two PPUs should be much easier to sync, so I guess that would be an interesting first test.

It could be the &quot;main&quot; layer, and the normal NES PPU would handle the sprites, and the &quot;top&quot; layer used for text, status bar, or whatever else. It would look like the Megadrive really I think, maybe slightly less colours but who cares ?<br /><br />An addition of several features for the extra PPU, either mode-7, offset per tile, or a second scrolling background, would kick everyone's ass so hard. The only problem is that all of this can't be done only with the expansion port, internal modification to the NES is necessary.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Perhaps Nintendo never acted on this because a lot of the features that a second PPU would provide could be done just as easily with hardware on the cartridge that blasts pixels to the regular PPU. (See: Wide Boy and Super FX.) I still believe it's possible to make a TV tuner for the NES, which would allow Xbox 360 level graphics.

I understand that you want to jump back and forth between the two video outputs, but I don't get how watching for values 0, 4, 8 and C would help with the switch.
