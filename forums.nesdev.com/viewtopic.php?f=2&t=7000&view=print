It is <a href="http://laughtonelectronics.com/arcana/Kimklone_short_summary.html" class="postlink">a co-processor that extends  the 65c02 architecture</a>, and it provides <em>new registers and new instructions</em> that are fully as fast and flexible as those of the legacy CPU. One of the main benefits is a 16 MByte address space, implemented without the constricting &quot;window&quot; arrangement that's the mainstay of ordinary memory expansion schemes.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the article! All feedback (and questions, especially if anything stated is unclear) are welcome.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Jeff<br /><br />Edit: Updated link; snappier blurb  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />
<br />And why are they flipping out over all this C stuff? I'd never write C on such a understood and good chip as that.  6502 != C.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Imagine putting one of these in a NES and writing C programs for NES!.....I bet games would run at , eh, 2 frames a second. Portability FTW.
<br />
<br />
<br />BUT ANYWAY....
<br />
<br />That project you have is pretty amazing.....I'd be more amazed if I understood hardware at all. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> But it seems epic. Keep on adding, man! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />ARM.
<br />
<br />As for C on 6502 family, NovaYoshi claims to have evidence that Koei's turn-based war sims were written in C, or at least in mixed C/assembly. Specifically, he ran <a href="http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?strings" class="postlink">strings</a> on a ROM and saw *printf() formatting commands. This would have allowed the same simulation to get compiled for 6502, Z80, GB-Z80, MC68000, and 8086, with different assembly language front-ends for each platform. In the modern era, use of C++ allows the same game with the same maps, physics, and NPC behaviors to get ported to i686 (PC 32-bit), amd64 (PC 64-bit), ARM (DS, iOS), PowerPC (Wii, 360, PS3), and MIPS (PSP), again with platform-specific front-ends.

<br />True, but that's not necessarily the compiler's fault. That's because whenever people need a certain feature they use a library for it, a library that does what they need plus tons of things they <strong>don't</strong> need. That adds up quickly.

<br />Sometimes the 20 MB allows for far more generality, allowing your program to reach a larger market. Arabic in particular reorders glyphs in the line and changes their shape based on their neighbors, and PC libraries have to support this behavior. Chinese has thousands of characters, and PC libraries need glyphs for these. PC screen resolutions and pixel depths vary from 640x480x8 bit all the way up to 1920x1080x32 bit and beyond; libraries have to support scaling of background and sprite textures, vector rendering, and color space conversion, and data needs more detail if the game isn't intentionally <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux" class="postlink">retraux</a>. PCs (apart from the far smaller market of home theater PCs) have smaller screens designed for one person per machine, and libraries have to support networking to communicate among copies of the program on separate machines.

<br />
<br />I think that the KimKlone was a really neat idea.  The design seems really nifty.  Definitely ++ geek points.
<br />
<br />The only thing even remotely like it that I've come across was a guy who built a dual-processor 68B09E computer.  The 68B09E uses a dual phase clock (phi-0 and phi-1, 90 degrees out of phase).  The CPU only drives the bus when one of the phases is active (I forget if it is high or low).  So the designer put both chips is parallel, except that he inverted one of the phases for only one of the CPUs.  The CPUs shared ROM and most RAM, but did have a small, per-CPU RAM bank (for stack and private vars).
<br />
<br />So it is similar to the KK in that the CPUs run in parallel on the SAME BUS, but totally different in that the KK's extra "processing" augments the existing CPU and is not SMP computing.

<br />
<br />CoCo3 was released in 1986 and was using software rendering, with a smaller resolution and smaller color palette than the Amiga which was released the same year.  As a result, the 68000 looked God-like because it was used in systems that used powerful graphics chips, whereas the 6309 was made to look like a cheap and crappy cpu because it was used in a few bottom-of-the-barrel computers.
<br />
<br />What did the 68000 have that the 6309 didn't?  Sure the 68000 was capable of being clocked at slightly higher Mhz speeds and had a few more internal registers, but for everything else, it gets its butt kicked by the 6309.
