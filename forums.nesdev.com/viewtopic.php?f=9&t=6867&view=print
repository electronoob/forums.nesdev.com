<br />
<br />theres a european nes with model number: NES-001E (that uses the blue cord and NES-004E controllers)
<br />
<br />and then you have the european fourscore models
<br />NES-034A   &lt;--- from sweden (scn)
<br />NESE-034 Ver. 1  &lt;--- only support NES-004E controllers
<br />NESE-034 Ver. 1.1  &lt;--- same as Ver. 1
<br />
<br />have seen in some nes docs that it might be a 75/300 Ohm and 300/75 Ohm converters for nes too (never seen those though)

<br />
<br />BTW the RF switch is absolutely identical in my imported USA NES and my european NES, only the RF connector changes (I have 4 RF switches now I think I don't know what to do with so many of them ! (for 3 consoles, don't ask me where I got the fourth) ).
<br />
<br />Also, with my SNES I bought used the AC adapter was an unofficial one, using DC voltage instead of AC. (it doesn't belong to the list, but I just wanted to say unofficial hardware was kind of common I guess).

<br />
<br />The Super NES in Europe uses the same PSU as the SFC, which is the same as the Famicom... +9VDC, whereas the USA NES power supply is +9VAC. The USA SNES also uses +9VDC, but has a different termination in order to prevent users from plugging in the NES +9VAC adapter in error and damaging the system.
<br />
<br />The NES can also run on +9VDC anyway, so one adapter with the correct rating will work on many systems. I wonder why Nintendo went with the +9VAC transformer in the first place, considering that the NES is the only product that ever used it. 
<br />
<br />What is special or different about the NES-004E controllers?
<br />
<br />Also, do you have photos of the blue-tip PSU or NES-004E control pads?

<br />
<br />Well, in 1985, I can't think of any console that used AC input. The VCS, InTV and CV all use DC as I recall. The CV was discontinued in 1984, and you couldn't plug a NES PSU into the VCS or 5200.
<br />
<br />I figure it was some weird cost-cutting or regional management issue. Maybe there is no legitimate answer... I certainly can't say for sure, but it is an oddity of the NES console on which only the original designers can shed any light.
<br />
<br />Moving back on-topic, I would like some photos of the Euro stuff, and any other EUR marker part numbers to add to the list. I need to know the ratings on the blue-tip PSU to note them on the list, and I need to know what makes the NES-1004E control pads different from the standard pads.
<br />
<br />Once I have this data, I will add the new entries.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i cannot verify if the blue topped PSU is 9VDC or not, all i know is that none of my FRG NESs and SNESs can be used with any of the (nes and snes) SCN PSUs i have, the inner diameter of the plug is wider on FRG than the one SCN and NTSC units uses (SCN and NTSC units uses the same diameter)
<br />
<br />I really don't know why FRG consoles are like this but it might be some kind of regulations/standard in the area
<br />
<br />as for the NES the graph looks like this(using Graphviz syntax):
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">digraph NES &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FRG_CONTROLS -&gt; FRG_SYSTEM;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FRG_CONTROLS -&gt; SCN_SYSTEM;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FRG_CONTROLS -&gt; NTSC_SYSTEM;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; SCN_CONTROLS -&gt; SCN_SYSTEM;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; SCN_CONTROLS -&gt; NTSC_SYSTEM;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; NTSC_CONTROLS -&gt; SCN_SYSTEM;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; NTSC_CONTROLS -&gt; NTSC_SYSTEM;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FRG_PSU -&gt; FRG_SYSTEM;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FRG_PSU -&gt; SCN_SYSTEM;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FRG_PSU -&gt; NTSC_SYSTEM;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; SCN_PSU -&gt; SCN_SYSTEM;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; SCN_PSU -&gt; NTSC_SYSTEM;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; NTSC_PSU -&gt; SCN_SYSTEM;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; NTSC_PSU -&gt; NTSC_SYSTEM;<br />&#125;</div>
<br />
<br />and i guess same graph would apply for SNES as well
<br />
<br />I have some fourscore photos of backside + PCB (all the components are still on tho) that i can mail you if you want, just PM me your mail but i think the difference is inside the IC
<br />
<br />I can check the controllers for you when i get home after work

But by using an AC adapter you're stressing the on-board power supply more (mostly the electrolytics C67 and C63) because of greater voltage ripple.
<br />
<br />So you might not want to do that <em>all</em> the time.

<br />
<br />Is there an RGB version of the cable? I thought that the SNES didn't support RGB out...
<br />
<br />They are the same cables/connectors used on the N64, Super Famicom and Famicom A/V as well. Not too expensive on eBay or on the 'net if you look around. I don't have many sets, not am I sure if I have cables meant for PAL stuff. The standard A/V shouldn't be system specific, but if you want SCART or RGB, that's another matter.
<br />
<br />If you go for composite, what you really want is the Japan-only S-Video cable. This may have been released for the N64or GC in other markets, but the SNES/SFC era version was only made for the SFC. These will give you the best audio and video short of actual RGB out. 
<br />
<br />I can try to find an original one for you if you really want one and have problems getting it via my distribution contacts in Nippon...
<br />
<br />You can wire the 'black box' RF modulator into an S-V out module by cutting the traces from the SNES tot he RF coils, and then adding the A/V lines inside the black box. If you want to have even more fun, you can add a switch on the traces to go back and forth between modes this way.
<br />
<br />If you want to go crazy, or want to avoid spending the money, you could also hardwire A/V, SCART or S-Video connectors to the outputs on the multi-video-out jack (directly to its solder joints) and run the wires out through a tiny hole, giving permanent, high-quality video-out. If the SNES supports RGB, you could wire that in directly as well.
<br />
<br />I have a PAL SNES (Australian version) and can can open it and photograph the areas you'd need to use if you want. 
<br />
<br />I don't know if you are good at soldering, but this is a very easy mod and requires around five solder points for S-video (ground, chroma, luma, audio-left, audio-right). 
<br />
<br />As an anecdotal note, the SNES/SFC/N64 video multiport is a slightly modified version of the Famicom Disk System COM port. You can modify this port to make FDS adapters and I <em>think </em>that the video cables can plug right into the FDS COM port as-is.
<br />
<br />Lastly, I agree that running the SNES on +9VAC is probably a bad idea... I didn't know it was even possible, but it doesn't shock me that Nintendo designed it this way, in case of accidental cord mixups. 
<br />
<br />if you ge ta chance, please add a list of the part numbers on all of your Euro stuff that you can so I can udate the list. if you feel up to opening the SNES and NES, I could use the internal part numbers as well, such as the SNES logic board part number for your SNES (and its region code to match). 
<br />
<br />I'm going to do this with all of the FC, NES, SNES and SFC stuff that I own in my collection.
<br />
<br />Eventually, i will add the codes for every NES, SNES, FC and SFC game cart too, but that'll take a lot of time, and I only have one (slightly damaged) set of hands. 
<br />
<br />I'm going nuts with the FlashTrack and FlashStick PCBs... Right now, the trackball works, but each pulse  also pauses/unpauses the game. that is, pressing A or Right works, but also pauses or unpauses the game int he same instant. Either I have a wiring error, a bad part, or a bad solder point. 
<br />
<br />My horrible eyesight doesn't he,p the process, so I'm going back to my trusty old breadboard and do some testing that way instead of just soldering from my schematic on a through-hole PCB. It'll make it much easier to debug, as I won't have to jumper connections on a 2cm square PCB.
<br />
<br />I also need a new source of both stranded and solid-core wire, in at least ten colours, but preferably thirty (solids and stripes) at 26-gauge and 27-gauge sizes.
<br />
<br />I'm suck of the limited colour choices at local shoppes. Any suggestions for a good supplier that has 26+ colours of wire in 26 or 28-gauge? I need both stranded and solid-core, the latter of which is nearly impossible to find these days, but is required for jumpering, wire-wrapping, and breadboarding. To a certain extent, it makes prototyping easier, but not production stuff. 
<br />
<br />Fr the NESpander, it would be nice to have 48 different selections of colours and colours+stripes. The way I'm doing it now, I have to number-flag each wire, and trust me, there are plenty of them.
<br />
<br />146 solder points in all, if memory serves, on a two-sided tiny PCB. At least, once I have the initial prototypes finished and tested, I can work out a finished PCB design CAD file and send it off, which will lower the amount of work dramatically to build them for other people to use. 
<br />
<br />I have about 70 solder points left on the current proto Dev board, so I should have it finished in a couple days, at which point I will upload the entire project gallery foe you all to view, and try to make a little video if I can borrow a video camera to demonstrate it in working order. 
<br />
<br />Don't forget to send me all the Nintendo part numbers that you can find, each with a short description of the part. Send me your name (or the name you want to appear in the credits) along with the data too if you want me to credit you for your additions. 
<br />
<br />When this is closer to done, I'd like to have an admin add it to the NESdev Wiki for everybody to use. I think that adding my NES EXP port to FC EXP port wiring pinout comparison to the Wiki would be a good idea for now...
