		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is looking great! Except Startropics, i get a strong Ys vibe from it, which is really nice. It captures the sense of adventure well, and i look forward to exploring the whole world. Well done!<br /><br />A few things came to mind, though:<br />-The trigger area for the great owl to appear in the forest is kind of easy to miss. I think it needs to be expanded as this is the very beginning of the game and players may be unsure exactly what to do, despite hints in town. <br />-Monsters drop 'health seeds' so often that chests feel kind of redundant. A minor tweak may help, even if it raises difficulty a little. This side effect could be mitigated by longer invincibility after hit time, if needed. <br />-I'm not too sure about having to swap the owl's attack for utility, or having to swap utilities for the sake of keeping at least the basic rush. Could perhaps every other move involve a 'basic' rush instead?<br />-I agree with Bregalad, specifically in one case. The own sweeps have a lengthy sound effect, and so i think it needs a bit lower volume. <br />-Rooms that lock until enemies are defeated should IMO do this only once per dungeon visit. Then the room should be opened for the remainder of the time while being in the dungeon. You could probably fit every bit needed in a temporary byte, if manipulating level data isn't an option.

As mentioned above, there was an auction on NA for a LE and soon there will be an SE. I tend not to plug commercial selling of my games, here, though, as I don't think that's allowed. The game is done and you will be able to find out about it at my website, <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gradualgames.com">www.gradualgames.com</a><!-- w -->, or gradualgames' Facebook or Twitter, when the SE is released.
