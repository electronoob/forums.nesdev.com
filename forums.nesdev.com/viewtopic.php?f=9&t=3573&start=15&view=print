<br />
<br />If you want to go through with it, you've got two real options: digitally allow only one cartridge to be enabled at a time, but this still requires you to power each and every cart at a time. The other option is to use relays to connect VCC and use tri-states on the rest of the pins, this will cost an insane amount! It's necessary though since you certainly cannot just use a switch on +5V and leave everything else connected.
<br />
<br />Why don't you buy a PowerPak and keep your real games in storage?

<br />Nintendo produced a six-slot jukebox during the NES days for use in store displays. But imagine a jukebox that uses something like an Exabyte tape robot to swap one of 200 Game Paks into a Game Pak slot.

<br />
<br />1) you cannot switch VCC to the carts to select one. 
<br />2) using floppy cables is a bad idea 'cause the length and capacitive coupling will eat your signals alive.
<br />3) This is an extremely NONtrivial device you're trying to build.
<br />
<br />
<br />By far the easiest way will be to plug your carts in 1 at a time like normal, or get a powerpak.  The famicombox has 16 cart ports on it, and they use switching for every 5 carts (15 on the front, 1 inside for the menu).
<br />
<br />To enable/disable the carts, they operate the /CE lines to the cart's ROMs (CHR and PRG), swap the CIRAM stuff separately, and they should've run IRQs separately but didn't.
<br />
<br />Again this is a pretty complex project to undertake, and even doing it the way I suggested (and the way nintendo did) isn't foolproof.   They still have a problem with games that map stuff below 8000h, like zelda or SMB3 or anything else that uses WRAM or registers down there.
<br />
<br />btw that animated avatar of yours is incredibly annoying.

<br />
<br />When I thought of the concept, it sounded pretty easy - the more I read on, the harder it looked - And I LIKED it.  The chanllenge is exciting,and there are a lot of problems yet to solve.  It's not always about what the easiest way to solve a problem is - half the fun is solving the problem.  I COULD just buy the powerpak and load roms onto it, but I woulden't feel the sense of pride I would when (if) I have a finished, home-made cart-switcher set up in my entertainment center.
<br />
<br />I'm also bound to learn a lot in the process, and the knowledge I gain might give me ideas for projects that you might find less pointless.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I'm sorry you aren't very interested in this project, and I hope to change your mind about it if I can pull it off.  
<br />In any case, thanks to everybody that's been piping in with suggestions and pointing me in the right direction.  It's given me a lot to think about in this last week. (Actually, it's been a little distracting during class.)
<br />
<br />I probably won't have time to work on any hardware until next weekend, but I have a few hours in-between classes on tuesday, so I might draw up some "cosmetic" design ideas in illustrator to get a feel for how i'd like the final unit to look.  If you think of anything helpful before I get started, but sure to let me know, and i'll read up on what I have to.  
<br />
<br />(Also, I was gone over the weekend, so that's why I didn't respond to the last little conversation.  Went to yosemite and did some hiking/fishing. Fun. Tired. Good to be home.)

<br />Many people feel the same as you, that's why they backup their very own game carts legally... If you want a project, creating a game dumper is a very good one. It's also a lot easier for someone without a bit of digital experience. To do the digital selector, you'd need:
<br />
<br />1) to make n of those connectors, which would be pretty insane when you can probably buy 72 pin edge connectors (normal ones, not ones for NES) for like $3 each from China.
<br />
<br />2) Either a CPLD or discrete logic circuit to select the games, if I had to do it, I would debounce a push button connected to a counter connected to a 7-segment decoder connected to the cart select logic (which selects which cartridge gets to access addresses &gt;$4017 and the PPU control lines.
<br />
<br />3) A cartridge + ~60 pin ribbon cable to the selection box.
<br />
<br />4) A Power supply that can power n game cartridges because games aren't guaranteed to have a low power mode. Maybe 200mA per game. If you did 16 games, that would require a ~3.2A power supply, very hefty unless it's a switching supply. The best option would be to reuse a PC power supply which would be overkill. Altogether it's pretty frivolous and wasteful of electronic resources since even after you switch games you'll have to get up and press reset unless you modify the NES as well.
<br />
<br />5) Perfboard to put components and connectors into.
<br />
<br />BTW, to be really moral you wouldn't buy any used games because the developers only see the initial sale. Today to still support the developers that are still around, you would have to stick exclusively to titles on the Wii's Virtual Console.

Today to still support the developers that are still around, you would have to stick exclusively to titles on the Wii's Virtual Console.</div><br /><br />As far as i'm concerned, a used product is a used product - extra copies of it arent being added to the market without the consent or knowledge of the creator.  Unless stated in some sort of sale contract or terms of use, i'm pertty sure that nintendo has no legal right to object to the resale of legitimate copies of video-games.  In fact, there have even been a few lawsuits in Japan that sided with the right to resell used games.<br /><br />In line with this, I don't consider "rom dumping" something I would feel comfortable with.<br />I figure the most ethical thing for me to do is respect Nintendo's opinion in the matter, as seen at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nintendo.com/corp/faqs/legal.html">http://www.nintendo.com/corp/faqs/legal.html</a><!-- m --><br />However, I have noticed if you read cafefully, the mostly forbid downloading a game from the internet and playing it, not dumping it yourself - later on that page they directly call game copiers illegal. It's been said they cite "Mask Work" laws to set their prodcut outside of what is allowed to be legally copied. -They also condemn emulator use for any and all reasons - a stance I disagree with, seeing how useful they are for homebrew applications. <br /><br />----<br /><br />An interesting, but unrelated veiwpoint on came/movie/music copying in the modern world has very much to do with the format it's in.  In the past, people have asked how downloading a movie or Mp3 is any different than recording it on a tape from a friend - and if it's not different, whats the fuss?  The difference, as it turns out is actually in the quality - every copy of a copy on an analog source degrades. Companies still objected to this kind of piracy, but at least they knew the only wa one could obtain a high-quality copy of their work was from the source - in digital format, there is no loss or degredation - the 100th copy is as clear as the first.  This kind of thinking has helped me get my head around copywrite violation objections.<br /><br />To bring the discussion back to NES games, the games age and function less well over time if not cared for - some games (such as Zelda) require maintaince and battery replacements to function properly after an amount of time.<br /><br />I'm not going to go out, find people, and berate and condem them for their rom dumping, emulator use, or copying of games (I'm looking at you DS flashcart guys with every major DS game avalible on one cart), but I certainly don't approve, and if it comes up i'll talk about it.<br /><br />Uh, anyway - you said something else that interested me.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> 1) to make n of those connectors, which would be pretty insane when you can probably buy 72 pin edge connectors (normal ones, not ones for NES) for like $3 each from China. </div>
<br />
<br />Whoo. Tell me about it, i'm not looking forward to building all of those, but what else can I do?  Before I started this project, I spent awhile googling around for such connectors, but coulden't find any at a price point I was satisfied with - most places I found wanted at least 7 per connector, and they were NES style, not generic China style. You woulden't have a link, would you?  It might cost me a little more, but the time it saves MIGHT be worth it. I'm still planning to build at least two of them to run some tests with (and because I think it's just plain neat that you can do that with old floppy cables)

If you can find a wholesaler/manufacturer of 72-&gt;60 pin adapters, they might be able to hook you up. Also, you ONLY want a generic perpendicular 72-pin connector, there is no suitable way to use Nintendo connectors unless you make edge finger boards for every game, which would be the worst idea ever.
