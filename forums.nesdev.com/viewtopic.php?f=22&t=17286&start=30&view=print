The multidirectional scroll is a modification of the original engine of Doug Fraker, which has also been adapted to work with the mapper MMC3 (to achieve plane effects). I found the music by chance in a forum dedicated to famitraker, and it was developed by MovieMovies1 for the mapper MMC5. Obviously, I have adapted it to work in the MMC3.<br /><br />It works perfectly on a real NES using flashcard and other methods.<br /><br /><strong>If you want to use it on PC or smartphone, the VirtuaNES emulator is recommended.</strong>

Even if it does work on real hardware (although it seems that different MMC3 implementations in flash carts are still disagreeing), and theoretically the original console has the final word, the fact that slight deviations from the real hardware are causing visible problems could mean your code is barely working, and under certain circumstances could still break.<br /><br />A lot of these emulators are pretty accurate (unlike VirtuaNES, from what I could find online) and can handle all sorts of games just fine, so they should be able to handle your effects without problems too. I think the effort of making this game/demo work well across different emulators is worth it, as you'll end up with a more robust engine overall.
