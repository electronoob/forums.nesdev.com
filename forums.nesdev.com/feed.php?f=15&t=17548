Apple marketing can rebrand and resperglord the name all they want. The fact of the matter is, just like in that thread as is in this one, <span style="text-decoration: underline">we all know what's being referred to no matter if you say Mac OS, OS X, or macOS</span>.  This is pure name/word pedantry.<br /><br />When Apple decided to call their 10th major revision of operating system &quot;Oh Ess Ten&quot; (or &quot;Oh Ess Exx&quot;, which would sometimes get you socially reprimanded), I don't remember any Mac pundits asking &quot;why are they doing that&quot; -- probably because it seemed obvious: marketing-driven silliness compounded with the general overall essence of importance/ego as a brand.  I'd occasionally run into individuals who would chastise me for spelling it &quot;OSX&quot;, by the way -- in the middle of a discussion about how to get something to work, or functionality, there'd be this &quot;and it's OSX, you're calling it the wrong thing&quot; non-sequitur thrown in; Stockholm syndrome is a strange thing.  Again: you know what product/thing I'm talking about, it's not relevant to the subject at hand, so why are we discussing it?<br /><br />Thus, it seemed funny that as of late 2016 when Apple decided to start calling it &quot;macOS&quot; -- almost identical to the original syntax -- again, nobody asked the question of why the change, or better yet, what that meant about the decision to call it &quot;OS X&quot; in the first place.  Both have the same answer as the previous time.  :-)<br /><br />There is some irony in this: the operating system still as of this writing is still major version 10 (10.13.6), so semantically, &quot;OS X&quot; is still true.  It won't be true when they release version 11, so calling it &quot;macOS&quot; or whatever, makes the most sense.<br /><br />Lisa almost certainly used the same line endings all Apple products of that time frame (doesn't matter if Mac or Apple II): byte 0x0d / carriage return.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Tue Jul 17, 2018 9:38 am</p><hr />

Phil Karlton's two hard things in computer science are &quot;cache invalidation and naming things&quot;. So I'm taking a digression in a topic about <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=221312#p221312" class="postlink">emulators on macOS</a> to a new topic. I seem to remember these being the official names:<br /><br /><ul><li>1.0-7.1: System </li><li>7.5-9.x: Mac OS </li><li>10.0-10.6: Mac OS X </li><li>10.7-10.11: OS X </li><li>10.12-10.13: macOS </li></ul><br />And as I understand it, versions prior to 10.0 ended up retroactively called &quot;classic Mac OS&quot; after Classic, Apple's virtualizer to run Mac OS 9 inside Mac OS X 10.0 through 10.4.<br /><br />Would &quot;Designed for OS X 10.9 through macOS 10.13&quot; sound too pedantic?<br /><br />I also have a pet peeve about certain text editors' name for &quot;Macintosh&quot; newlines (CR, 0x0D) to contrast them with &quot;Windows&quot; (CR LF, 0x0D 0x0A) and &quot;UNIX&quot; (LF, 0x0A) newlines. &quot;Macintosh&quot; newlines are used on classic Mac OS, not Mac OS X 10.0 and later. The sequence appears to have been inherited from ProDOS on the Apple II. (What did Lisa use?) I guess text editor developers could rationalize it in that Apple transitioned from &quot;Macintosh&quot; to &quot;Mac&quot; branding sometime around 10.0, when it adopted UNIX newlines. If I had my way, they'd be called &quot;ProDOS&quot;, &quot;CP/M&quot;, and &quot;UNIX&quot; newlines. (<a href="http://neilrieck.net/docs/openvms_notes_text_files.html" class="postlink">VMS text files</a>, on the other hand, appear to be sequences of Pascal strings: preceded by a 2-byte little-endian byte count up to 32767, followed by 0x00 if the line length was odd, with length -1 meaning end of file.)<br /><br />What newlines did Mac's predecessor Lisa use?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Tue Jul 17, 2018 6:32 am</p><hr />
