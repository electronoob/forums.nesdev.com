The whole &quot;uncanny valley&quot; thing. 3D faces always freak me out. They keep getting further and further up the asymptotic graph towards &quot;actual reality&quot; but somehow I feel they will never actually reach it, it'll always just look weird like some satanic puppet that has come alive. Keyframe animation and movement in particular ALWAYS looks fake to me. Too smoothed and tweened. I'll take hand animation and pixel art any day over this kind of stuff...<br /><br />So when games intentionally remain more fantastical, like Zelda, I appreciate it a lot more because it isn't <em>TRYING</em> to look real, so it doesn't freak me out and it remains appealing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When isn't there music? Every village has its distinct theme (those are the best IMO). Fighting big baddies like stone golems and ogres has a memorable hook. Riding has a song (this gets old after a while if you ride much). Stables have a song. The labyrinth and dark forest have a good common song. There's the shrine song, the tower song (this one is maybe classifiable as a long fanfare, but memorable all the same)... Even cooking/brewing has a memorable drum jingle. The bard plays songs, naturally. <br /><br />The region songs are a bit toned down, leaning more on ambience.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><a href="https://youtu.be/Z_YdGxq9sKI" class="postlink">This video</a> of the new Samus Returns game perfectly illustrates my problem with modern game soundtracks, contrasting it with Metroid 2 on the gameboy. (or some remake of it I guess)<br /><br />I would take the fascinating, otherworldly, engaging and heroic melodies of yore 1,000x over the ambient soundscapes of today. My guess is Full Sail or others have graduated 1000s of people who are like &quot;HEY I CAN CLICK IN MUSIC SOFTWARE AND ACT LIKE I AM A GAME COMPOSER&quot; but, very very few of them are actually composing <em>music.</em> Oh well...I'm old, maybe melodies are anachronistic anymore...movies largely have the same problem. Everything just putters on with something recognizably played on instruments but, where's the next Star Wars theme? Where's the next Indiana Jones theme? Where's the next Super Mario Bros. theme? Where's the next Star Trek theme? Where's the next Labyrinth soundtrack? Where's the next Dark Crystal? Where's any music at all?<br /><br />Maybe its lack of piano lessons? No idea. But it appears to be a dying art. (even though there seem to be thousands of people writing chiptunes, their talents don't wind up in modern games for some reason)<br /><br />I just don't understand. It's not like having a greater palette of possible sounds makes it impossible to write melodies. Composers just <em>aren't doing it.</em> On the whole, anyway. Shovel Knight is a rare exception. OH! And Undertale 's soundtrack was utterly amazing.<br /><br />It's probably more a trend than anything else. I hate trends.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I mainly have a problem with Western games. America has always been un-creative when designing Video Games. They make a whole bunch of shooter games because they sell well, and are afraid to try anything new. I mean, we have Halo, Call of Duty, Overwatch, Gears of War, Battlefield, and Destiny. American Video Game companies, who have billions of dollars, are scared to have 1 game fail. What happens if the mass gets tired of shooter games? These companies will have already based their entire company off of shooter games, and they could possibly all fall under.
