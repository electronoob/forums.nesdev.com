		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the correction. That reminds me that an additional fix is very likely needed. (If what we're talking about is actually the issue.)<br /><br />Should the NMI interrupt before all three values (scrollX, scrollY, $2000 shadow) have been updated, the suggested fix might cause some slight visual issues because the three values are out of sync. A way to fix this would be to store them to three new bytes of RAM in addition to the registers in the NMI itself, then use that new RAM to restore them in your hacked NMI. In this way the values are guaranteed to be exactly what the NMI put there before your IRQ changes it. They would not subject to being changed by the game loop during a lag frame and becoming out of sync.<br /><br />Edit: Worth noting a thing like the above would be why Metroid doesn't update those registers on a lag frame.

I tried three different extractors just to be sure. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I read I should backup $2005 &amp; $2000? what is the proper way of loading and storing those values?</div><br />Yes, you probably should. My last post explains the proper way. You want to store what the NMI actually writes there. So break on execution starting at the real NMI. Then break on writes to $2000/$2005. Those are the values you want to store to RAM. You want to store them to RAM directly after the NMI writes them itself.<br /><br />To restore, you read that RAM and write to $2000/$2005 at the beginning of your hacked NMI in place of this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDA $FF;Seems to be a shadow Metroid uses for $2000, assuming<br />STA $2000;Your IRQ code is correct<br /></div><br /><br />Edit: Alternatively, just as a really quick check you can write the horizontal/vertical scroll values to $2005 directly under the code above. That &quot;fix&quot; will still have some rare problems, but if it mostly works then it's up to you to find free RAM and space to actually preserve these values in the NMI.<br /><br />I can't say what the cause of jitter crazy might be since I can't see it. I'd assume it's because of the exact same thing, though. As stated before, just the write to $2000 is not a full fix.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What I hope happens is that the game then renders from the correct nametable, but the scroll is always 0, 0. (In which case, much like how I suggested you rewrite $FF to $2000 at the beginning of your hacked NMI, you'd also need to rewrite the X/Y scroll values to $2005.)</div><br />In your video, the scroll is 0, 0. So just the write to $2000 would be fine there. As you travel eastward, the horizontal scroll would be changing, but your IRQ still changes it to 0,0 and your stubbed NMI doesn't fix it. So the nametable would be correct (related to $2000), but the scroll would not be (related to $2005 which you haven't backed up yet.) It could be something else too, who knows?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It seems your edit caught it. Yes, because $2005 is a double write register you need to write both $FC and $FD to it.<br /><br />However, again, that alone is still prone to problems. (Though they'd be rare.) You do need to store both values the NMI writes to $2005 and the one it writes to $2000 to unused RAM to be really, really safe. The reason your first attempt (with $11E and $11F) did not work is because it only saved the Y value of the scroll. (Which actually was then stored as the X scroll, since the first write to $2005 writes the X scroll.) <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_registers#Scroll_.28.242005.29_.3E.3E_write_x2" class="postlink">You can read about $2005 here.</a><br /><br />Still glad you're pleased with the result.

I have yet to edit the actual nametable drawings when traveling horizontaly. The game makes it vertical mirroring when traveling horizontal, and makes it horizontal when traveling verticaly. So you will see the HUD disappear when I move back and forth enough distance. The HUD I have occupying the $2800ppu nametable at $2B40,$2B60,$2B80,$2BA0. Idk if the asm I borrowed and srtipped down (from SMB3) is causing my writes to $2B#0's not to write there, cause you will see block tiles to the far left of the HUD. This im simply going to overlook, cause I'm going to add that black line that is vertical down the entire leftmost part of the screen, once I get the nametables writes altered. The palette attributes for the HUD are not set, so it's all looking bland. But again, it's just to demonstrate that I finally got the IRQ working. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK new update. <br /><br />I'm messing with the original engines mechanics, on how it draws to the nametable, so I can have my irq split not be overwritten during the scroll. When moving left to right, Metroid performs Vertical mirroring. But Im forcing the game to write horizontaly when moving left/right, just like Super Mario Bros 3.<br /><br />Now, I am no expert in this field, so I've been altering specific things to make this work, and it's about 98% to my desire. <br /><br />Now, I know that with horizontal mirroring, I will get nametable writes appearing to the far left of the game, (yes I know I need to alter the ppu to have it draw the vertical black bar to hide it) but I also know (from smb3) that there are tiles that are drawn to the far right of the screen as well when moving left. In SMB3, if you move ever so gently to the left, it shows only a 4 pixel width of vertical tiles on the right side of the screen. But with my hack, it's showing an 8 pixel width of vertical tiles on the rightside of the screen, looking quite awful. Idk if there is a trick to making only 4 pixels appear than the 8 im experiencing?<br /><br />And the main reason for this update is....<br /><br />If my horizontal scanline stops on a #7 or #0 after traversing either left or right, and want to turn back the other way, the scanline will not update correctly, thus, leaving the vertical line of gfx still on the screen. If the scanline lands on any other value, and you turn the other direction, the scanline properly updates the tiles within the nametable.<br /><br />I've uploaded 2 very quick videos, demonstrating my issue. The 1st video is Samus stopped on scanline #6, this shows the far right set of vertical tiles properly update. The 2nd video is Samus stopped on scanline #7, this shows the far right set of vertical tiles NOT properly updated.<br /><br />I apologize, the old embedded code has been removed from youtube, and the embed they give me isn't working. :-/<br /><br /><strong>video 1</strong><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-Ruf8NtV6g&amp;list=UU2RNcDW2wla6JlAqE-pvsDg&amp;index=2" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-Ruf8NtV6g&amp;list=UU2RNcDW2wla6JlAqE-pvsDg&amp;index=2</a><br /><br /><strong>video 2</strong><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0R_f5fy67M&amp;index=1&amp;list=UU2RNcDW2wla6JlAqE-pvsDg" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0R_f5fy67M&amp;index=1&amp;list=UU2RNcDW2wla6JlAqE-pvsDg</a>

Idk if there is a trick to making only 4 pixels appear than the 8 im experiencing?</div><br />This probably happens because the game updates 2 columns of tiles at once, and since only 8 pixels are hidden on the left you get more visible trash. To fix this you have to update only 1 column of tiles for every 8 scrolled pixels, instead of 2 columns every 16 pixels. You will probably have to buffer the second half of the column and update it at a later time (after 8 more pixels scrolled).<br /><br />I'm not familiar with the Metroid engine, but changing the mirroring of a scrolling engine can be a very complicated task, depending on how early new tiles are drawn to the name tables. Some Capcom games for example draw big 32x32-pixel blocks in advance, which would overwrite a big chunk of the opposite side of the scrolling direction. That would be hell to convert to horizontal mirroring.<br /><br />The issues you're having are certainly related to this. A second column of tiles is drawn in advance, because with vertical mirroring they'd be completely hidden. Walking the other way probably doesn't trigger name table updates because the engine doesn't expect that data to be overwritten, since it wouldn't be with all the horizontal room of vertical mirroring. With horizontal mirroring you are overwriting the tiles though, so you probably have to find a way to trigger the rendering of columns every time a column boundary (8 pixels) is crossed. Not trivial at all, IMO.
