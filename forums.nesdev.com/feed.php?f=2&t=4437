This is not a bad idea, in some cases. This might save you a good amount of time if you're dealing with lots of objects.<br /><br />However, for precision bits, I don't think this is a good idea. Most objects are going to move to a new pixel almost every frame. Moving to a new 256x256 chunk happens a lot less often though. So you'd probably want to use your method for something like that instead of using it for things like precision bits.<br /><br />One way you could do it is:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">clc<br />lda XCoordL<br />adc #5<br />sta XCoordL<br />bcc +<br />inc XCoordH<br />+<br /></div><br /><br />If you're dealing with absolute addresses, that optimization would save you 7 cycles if you weren't increasing the high byte. For ZP, it would save you 5, but that's still good. It would take one cycle less if it wraps around for ZP variables than a 16-bit addition would. It would take two less for an absolute 16-bit addition. Very good in some cases.<br /><br />But this assuming that you're doing 16-bit 8-bit addition, meaning you're adding an 8-bit number to a 16-bit number.<br /><br />Also, you might have some problems if you're dealing with signed numbers. Lots of people prefer to add a negative number instead of subtracting a positive one. I like doing this myself. This example I don't think would work for that though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat Oct 11, 2008 6:56 pm</p><hr />

Unless you want to rewrite everything when you do a game that scrolls or port your game to another system with higher resolution, it's way better to use 16-bit cords.<br /></div>I won't deny that switching from eight to sixteen bit precision throughout the game halfway through the project would be nasty. But then adding scrolling to a game fundamentally changes large parts of the code, beyond just the coordinate system. And believe me, the hardware differences between the NES and a C64 are large enough to make direct ports of anything but the simplest of games virtually worthless.<br />Don't waste too much time trying to accommodate features you might potentially need in the future, or limit the code in order to be compatible with other hardware you might wish to port to. That kind of programming is simply too restrictive for 6502 games wanting to make good use the hardware, not to mention time consuming.<br />The best advice I can give is to design your game ahead of time, and try to stick to it. Study other games to see how the handle things, figure out what the tricky hardware bits are and write prototypes, sketch out little dummy routines for doing common tasks with the system you're envisioning before deciding anything, and last but not least don't go overboard with the fancy features (not that I've ever managed to follow that last bit of advice myself.)<br /><br />By the way my current C64 shooter project uses 8-bit x coordinates for the most part despite the 320-pixel wide screen. This is handled by using the trick I mentioned earlier of shifting up the coordinates by one bit.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Probably just because it's easier to have a line of 4 bytes for each metatiles than to have 4 arrays with one entry per metatiles.

The problems come when you need to store additional attributes (say, collision or palette data) for the meta-tiles or when you need more than 64 of them. Anyway, I don't know what you're doing with the unused bit-pairs (palette attributes perhaps?) but you might get away with storing the tiles premultiplied instead.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Yet it's true that maybe I should split some arrays, after all this isn't that long doing it by hand or with a small programm (but writing it would probably take longer than doing everything by hand unless I have really big arrays).<br /></div>Feel free to use <a href="http://doynax.googlepages.com/interleave.zip" class="postlink">my tool</a> if that would help. Properly integrated into your makefile/build script it shouldn't be too intrusive.<br /><br />Occasionally it might be inconvenient or just plain impossible to shuffle external files around, usually when referencing labels defined inside of the ROM itself, but I've found that with a bit of macro abuse you can at least avoid any repetition and keep the structures together.

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />My advice is to go for 8-bit precision if at all possible. Not having to bother with 16-bit coordinates everywhere makes so many things so much easier that it's not even funny. A fractional fixed-point byte beneath the screen coordinates occasionally comes in handy as well, but there's no need to burden all objects and algorithms with it when only some of them care. Besides, you can often fake sub-pixel movements in other ways. Personally I like to keep a set of "frame counter mod n" variables handy for such things.<br /></div><br />No, no, no.

There aren't any INXs or shifting/adding at all. It's simply load and store. I see no reason good enough to do it the other way.<br /></div><br />Well, it's true that in that particular case, the second version is much more optimized takes less bytes and less time. Yet, most of my game engine's code looks rather like your first example. I bet I could optimize a lot of things I haven't yet, I'd have to look for it.<br />Probably just because it's easier to have a line of 4 bytes for each metatiles than to have 4 arrays with one entry per metatiles. And the array is less than 256 bytes so no [¨],Y needed so it woud just save 2 ASL instructions to split the array. I could do that after I wrote all the metatiles of the game if I feel like it but meh... (but there is other things that metatiles like that too).<br /><br />However, I've been optimizing stuff for about 2 years and make very slow progress to the project (because when I lack ideas I improve what alredy exists). If I do it forever my game will never be released, and I don't want that to happen.

True, there are several optimizations that you could do like the one shown. But you know, this:<br /><br />ldx Index     ;4<br />lda PointerListL,x     ;9<br />sta TempAddL     ;12<br />lda PointerListH,x     ;17<br />sta TempAddH     ;20<br /><br /><br />Takes a lot less time. Yes, yes, I'm sure you know. Oh, and you could snap it to start on a page boundary, and use ZP indexes, so it would take:<br /><br />ldx Index     ;3<br />lda PointerListL,x     ;7<br />sta TempAddL     ;10<br />lda PointerListH,x     ;14<br />sta TempAddH     ;17<br /><br />3 cycles less. Though it's really not that much different, it's 30 cycles if you do this 10 times. And 20 even if you can't use a ZP index. Though it would in probably a lot of occasions be less cycles if you didn't snap the arrays to page boundaries, it's safe to assume it's going to take 5 cycles for the LDA PointerListL, x rather than 4.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Wed Oct 08, 2008 7:09 pm</p><hr />

To be fair though this particular example can be optimized a bit even with non-interleaved arrays.<br /><br />With branches (25 cycles):<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">   lda index<br />   asl<br />   tay<br />   bcs +<br /><br />   lda list+$000,y<br />   ldx list+$001,y<br />   bcc ++<br /><br />+  lda list+$100,y<br />   ldx list+$101,y<br /><br />++ sta data_ptr+0<br />   stx data_ptr+1</div><br /><br />Or a preinitialized list pointer (32 cycles):<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">   lda #&lt;list<br />   sta list_ptr+0<br />   .<br />   .<br />   .<br />   lda index<br />   asl<br />   tay<br />   lda #&gt;list<br />   adc #0<br />   sta list_ptr+1<br /><br />   lda &#40;list_ptr&#41;,y<br />   sta data_ptr+0<br />   iny<br />   lda &#40;list_ptr&#41;,y<br />   sta data_ptr+1</div><br />Then again you often have to deal with more complicated lookups than that. Not to mention that code size/complexity and register pressure/restrictions are significant drawbacks of manual pointer arithmetic. Besides, I'll go for the optimization over simplicity pretty much every time on the 6502 ;)<br /><br />My tip is to abuse your macro processor and write yourself a simple interleaving tool to take care of this for you. Then at least you won't have to go through the error-prone process of spreading out and maintaining interleaved tables. Come to think of it I wouldn't mind a bit of direct assembler support for this kind of thing. I believe I could modify ACME's incbin directive to take an interleave factor easily enough.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">doynax</a> — Wed Oct 08, 2008 4:54 pm</p><hr />

I'm for interleaving data, and I don't see why you wouldn't unless you were using 128 pointers and not 256. Let's see here... Here is some sample code of loading a pointer in an un-interleaved array to a Temp Address.<br /><br />lda PositionInArray<br />asl a<br />sta TempAddL<br />lda #$00<br />adc #&gt;PointerList      ;If the position in array is more than 128, the carry will be set, thus adding 1.<br />sta TempAddH<br />clc<br />lda TempAddL<br />adc #&lt;PointerList<br />sta TempAddL<br />ldy #0<br />lda (TempAddL),y<br />sta TempAdd2L<br />iny<br />lda (TempAddL),y<br />sta TempAdd2H<br /><br />That's one way you could get a pointer out of the array. Though you could modify it if you force the array to start at a specific location and save time. But to me, that's a big shindig. Why do that when you can do this:<br /><br />ldx PositionInArray<br />lda PointerListL.w,x<br />sta TempAddL<br />lda PointerListH.w,x<br />sta TempAddH<br /><br />That's so much less dinking around! There aren't any INXs or shifting/adding at all. It's simply load and store. I see no reason good enough to do it the other way.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Wed Oct 08, 2008 4:08 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Well I've never see a programm to split arrays into multiple arrays.

It's just a natural order and access of data on an 65x.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3645">tomaitheous</a> — Wed Oct 08, 2008 3:09 pm</p><hr />

My advice is to go for 8-bit precision if at all possible. Not having to bother with 16-bit coordinates everywhere makes so many things so much easier that it's not even funny. A fractional fixed-point byte beneath the screen coordinates occasionally comes in handy as well, but there's no need to burden all objects and algorithms with it when only some of them care. Besides, you can often fake sub-pixel movements in other ways. Personally I like to keep a set of "frame counter mod n" variables handy for such things.<br /><br />Granted, sometimes 8-bits simply isn't enough. With the clipped display being 248 pixels wide already there simply isn't enough wiggle room to smoothly move 16-pixel objects out of screen easily, and that's surely necessary for horizontally scrolling  games even if you might get away without it in single-screen designs. Still, even scrolling games rarely need to deal with off-screen pixels. Not by more than a couple of tiles anyway. So instead of introducing a bunch of extra precision on top of the normal eight bits it's often enough to simply add a ninth bit, and keep the former LSB together with the fixed-point fraction in another byte.<br />That way a single byte is still enough for most tasks, like collision detection or fast-moving bullets, even if it cannot address odd pixels. And putting together a real pixel position for, say, the sprite position is only a matter of a single shift. For a scrolling game the question still remains whether to keep the coordinates screen-relative, or have them be world-relative and let the nine bits wrap. Either way is potentially problematic and the best choice likely depends on the genre and how you interact with the background map.<br /><br />By the way, if the benefits of a SoA layout is still somewhat unclear then consider how you'd deal with a list of game actors and their properties (assuming that the array is larger than 256 bytes, but that ought to be true for most any game.) How would you access the property fields to write general game logic? How do you move from one actor to the next? What about following a pointer? And what happens if you need to work with two actors simultaneously?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">doynax</a> — Wed Oct 08, 2008 1:37 pm</p><hr />
