		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've come up with a much better explanation of this after spending some time on it.<br /><br />There are two primary ways ROMs can be mapped on the bus:<br /><br />Mode 0:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">00-7f:8000-ffff -&gt; 40-7f:0000-7fff<br />80-ff:8000-ffff -&gt; c0-ff:0000-7fff</div><br /><br />Mode 1:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">40-7f:0000-ffff -&gt; 00-3f:8000-ffff<br />c0-ff:0000-ffff -&gt; 80-bf:8000-ffff</div><br /><br />The lefthand side reflects the native area, where ROM is mapped to linearly (each address is one byte further into the ROM.)<br />The righthand side is the &quot;secondary&quot; area.<br /><br />Mode 0 <em>never</em> connects A15 to the ROM address lines. So the address is {A22-A16, A14-A0}<br />Mode 1 <em>always</em> connects A15 to the ROM address lines. So the address is {A21-A0}<br />By not connected, I mean the bits in the address are shifted right to compensate, so it's like A15 does not exist at all.<br /><br />So in mode 0, the effect is that Bus 008000 = ROM 000000, Bus 018000 = ROM 080000, etc for the left-hand side. And Bus c00000 == Bus c08000 == Bus 008000, etc.<br /><br />And in mode 1, the effect is that the left-hand side is linear: Bus c00000 = ROM 000000, Bus c08000 = ROM 008000. And the right-hand side has A15 always forced high because you can only access ROM in $xx:8000-ffff there. So Bus 008000 = ROM 008000, Bus 018000 = ROM 018000, etc.<br /><br />Now of course, there are special case variations to this. Different PCBs will change where RAM is mirrored, some won't map anything into c0-ff:0000-7fff, some won't even map c0-ff at all (SuperFX), etc.<br /><br />But we can narrow down LoROM vs HiROM to whether or not A15 is connected to the ROM pins. We don't need the complexity of &quot;linear&quot; and &quot;shadow&quot;, or all that LoROM and HiROM entails. We simply need to provide where the ROM appears on the bus, and whether A15 is used or ignored. And that's enough to describe every commercial board ever released.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />byuu, you're such a programmer <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />I kind of consider what has been said incomplete and overcomplicated; technically LoROM can straightforwardly map up to 63.5 Mbits.<br /><br />Heres my explanation:<br /><br />LoROM / Mode 20: 00-FF:8000-FFFF (except for the two RAM banks where /ROMSEL isn't asserted), mirrored into 0000-7FFF on many banks (40-7F, C0-FF) where /ROMSEL is asserted because of partial decoding via A15.<br /><br />HiROM / Mode 21: 00-FF:0000-FFFF (the entire address space, except for the 33 Mbits where /ROMSEL isn't asserted), this has a consequence of mapping ROM into banks (00-3F, 80-BF) where 0000-7FFF is not accessible so it must be accessed at a mirrored location where it is or significant ROM is forfeited.<br /><br />The vectors in HiROM games must be placed at FFF? in ROM, LoROM needs them at 7FF? like a NES game.<br /><br />All other mapping is achieved through secondary address decoding (partial and/or full) and scheme mixing.

How could those responses come from internal RAM, depending on the cart design? Rather, I would think that the SNES' wiring, before the cartridge even comes into play, should forward read/writes to the cart slot or to RAM based on the particular address requested.
