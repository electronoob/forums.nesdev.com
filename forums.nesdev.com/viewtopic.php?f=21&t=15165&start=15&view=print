It was just a general observation of the SD-artstyle.<br /><br />Contra is drawn in a realistic style, but for RPGs and the like you often want to cram in a full character in a small low-resolution sprite and still see the facial expressions (as you mention yourself in those links), and in that case the SD-style is the natural approach I guess, besides it being cute.<br />Of course many games use it even if they don't really need to do it for technical reasons. It's just a very lovable style of art.
