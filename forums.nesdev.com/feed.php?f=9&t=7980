That's interesting.  I would be curious if the dump is the same although based on what you're saying it really shouldn't be.  I'm curious why they would make the two different boards.  Perhaps you're right about excess chips or something, but they still have the added cost of the '32.<br /><br />The wiring should be fairly straight forward.  Just connect all the corresponding pins.  You'll have to lift pins or cut traces but you should be able to just copy the SLROM setup.  Bypass the single OR gate that's being used if you want, apparently that the only difference between wiring on the two boards.  If you're confused about the control signals post pics of the pinouts and I'll explain here.<br /><br />My real concern is space though...

OK I did a little more looking around and I found out that the extra 74HC32 on the SL1ROM is actually to combine A13 and RD of the CHR data into one enable signal on the smaller 28 bin 128k chips nintendo used instead of having them seperate as they are on a 32pin 128k chip. Funny they have a 32pin PRG slot but not for the CHR and they added an extra chip to keep to the 28 pin form factor on the CHR side. They must have had an excess of 28 pin chips or something I dunno.<br /><br />I just took apart the last 3 Operation Wolf carts I own and I did finally find one that is on a normal SLROM versus this dreaful SL1ROM but after finding out that the 74HC32 is combinding the signals from A13 and RD of the CHR chip I doubt dumping the chips is worth while.  I'm near possitive the code will be the exact same on 32pin CHR chip from the SLROM vs the 28pin CHR chip on the SL1ROM cause it looks to be a hardware modification here not a software change of any sort. I will still dump them if anyone is intrested in compairing the code for shits and giggles. <br /><br />Needless to say, This is getting a little out of my league now trying to figure out  how to get a 32pin 27c010 onto a SL1ROM but if anyone else does figure it out I'd love to see a diragram and\or a schematic of how to do it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3870">nintendo2600</a> — Wed Jul 20, 2011 10:23 pm</p><hr />

Yeah there are both  32 pin and 28pin versions of the 128KB ROMs, the 28pin version uses every last pin while the 32 pin has some unused pins tied to Vcc and whatnot.  Making that work should be just a matter of matching up the address and enable lines are connected properly.<br /><br />But the other issue is that extra OR gate that slapped in on the SL1ROM board.  I don't know the details of what it's doing as I haven't drawn out the circuit yet, but I'm sure it'll prevent SLROM games from working.  Not sure about that though, it may depend on the game.  Unless there was a SL1ROM and SLROM version of Monster party that game works on both boards apparently.<br /><br />If it something you're not willing to take on yourself I could help you out.  I converted a UNROM to UOROM and TSLROM to TSROM for @coinhaven.  In return he let me keep the repro I ended up making.  I took scans of the board and description of how to make the change so he could replicate it.  Speaking of I need to post those up here for others to see also.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Mon Jul 18, 2011 9:39 pm</p><hr />

Looks as though the big difference is the SLROM lacks the '32 set of OR gates that the SL1ROM has aside from the CHR size difference.<br /><br />Interestingly I checked one of my SL1ROM games Monster Party and turns out my version is actually a SLROM when all 3 of bootgod's are SL1ROM.  <br /><br />I've gone through and reverse drawn the circuit for SLROM previously but not SL1ROM.  I do plan to, perhaps I'll do it sooner vice later if you could make use of it. <br /><br />It looks as though only one of the OR gates is actually used.  I'm a little confused though you're saying that SL1ROM is limited to 64k (byte I assume) and you want to put 1meg (bit i assume ie 128KByte)<br /><br />But it appears all SL1ROM boards are 128KByte (1Mbit) according to bootgod's data base anyways.  So it would appear SL1ROM normally uses 128KByte like you're wanting it to...
