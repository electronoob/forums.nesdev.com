		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I believe this is <span class="posthilit">a</span> fairly good example of &quot;cultural ignorance&quot; per se, where person from country X has no familiarity with the realities of country Y.  Bregalad presumably works in Switzerland, so <span class="posthilit">what</span> their laws are I have no idea, but I <strong>can</strong> tell <span class="posthilit">you</span> <span class="posthilit">what</span> the real world is like in the United States:<br /><br />Most US businesses (medium or large, but same issue can apply regardless of size) work like this: if anyone -- **ANYONE** -- catches <span class="posthilit">you</span> doing that here and reports it or if someone concerns gets wind of <span class="posthilit">what</span> <span class="posthilit">you</span>'re doing, <span class="posthilit">you</span>'ll either be fired or reprimanded (severely).  If <span class="posthilit">you</span>'d like to see <span class="posthilit">a</span> copy of <span class="posthilit">what</span> <span class="posthilit">you</span> sign when starting at <span class="posthilit">a</span> software company in the US, let me know and I can dig up some examples (or even scan some of my own agreements, with all surrounding context blacked out), but in most cases it states clearly that anything created by <span class="posthilit">you</span> during work hours is the ownership of that company.  Violations of that, barring pre-agreed-upon exceptions (PRIOR to signing the agreement) -- ex. working on open-source and contributing patches back to the community -- can/will result in lawsuits.<br /><br />Now, if <span class="posthilit">you</span>'re inclined to say &quot;so <span class="posthilit">what</span>?&quot;, let me explain to <span class="posthilit">you</span> <span class="posthilit">what</span> really happens in this situation commonly:<br /><br />* <span class="posthilit">You</span> lose your job, so <span class="posthilit">you</span> no longer have income.  <span class="posthilit">You</span> are usually eligible <span class="posthilit">for</span> unemployment, but in the US unemployment is often too small/low to live off of reliably or <span class="posthilit">for</span> very long.  The way the system works, the previous employer can also refuse to agree to pay unemployment, and then <span class="posthilit">you</span> get to go to court to appeal that situation (this is separate from the below legal stuff),<br /><br />* The next job <span class="posthilit">you</span> apply at will ask <span class="posthilit">you</span> &quot;why aren't <span class="posthilit">you</span> with Company X any more?&quot; and <span class="posthilit">you</span> will either have to lie to them (and risk being fired and/or sued if they find out <span class="posthilit">you</span> lied -- there are many examples of this happening, even some recently at the CEO level where someone lied about their credentials), or <span class="posthilit">you</span> have to tell them &quot;I was fired <span class="posthilit">for</span> fucking around on company time&quot;.  So by doing this <span class="posthilit">you</span> risk people not hiring <span class="posthilit">you</span> <span class="posthilit">for</span> the rest of your life, hoping someone cuts <span class="posthilit">you</span> some slack / gives <span class="posthilit">you</span> <span class="posthilit">a</span> break (I've heard of some people actually pleading with interviewers as well, especially if they've been out of work <span class="posthilit">for</span> <span class="posthilit">a</span> while given these circumstances, e.g. &quot;Look I know <span class="posthilit">what</span> I did was wrong at the old job, but I REALLY need this job, please...&quot;),<br /><br />* <span class="posthilit">You</span> get sued by the company who <span class="posthilit">you</span> worked <span class="posthilit">for</span>, and depending on &quot;how&quot; they choose to react within the legal system, <span class="posthilit">you</span> may end up with police at your door one day (not kidding), and if <span class="posthilit">you</span> get hauled off to the local jail, <span class="posthilit">you</span>'re also going to need <span class="posthilit">a</span> very large sum of money <span class="posthilit">for</span> bail (judges will likely consider <span class="posthilit">you</span> <span class="posthilit">a</span> flight risk given the nature of the situation; US$5000 is not uncommon),<br /><br />* <span class="posthilit">You</span> begin to undergo constant anxieties (often mental stress-related problems (i.e. health problems)) due to the amount of pressure of the lawsuit; <span class="posthilit">you</span> think about the case every day, worried sick until it's over -- <span class="posthilit">you</span> even reach <span class="posthilit">a</span> point where <span class="posthilit">you</span>'re thinking &quot;I don't even care any more, I'll just plead no contest, I just want this to end&quot;.  It is not <span class="posthilit">a</span> &quot;zzz boring&quot; thing, it weighs on <span class="posthilit">you</span> constantly, <span class="posthilit">you</span> fear answering the phone or answering the door sometimes.  This goes on <span class="posthilit">for</span> months, and in many cases <span class="posthilit">a</span> year or more (US legal system is slow),<br /><br />* If <span class="posthilit">you</span> lose the case, the complexities/problems there are almost limitless,<br /><br />* If <span class="posthilit">you</span> win the court case, <span class="posthilit">you</span>'re financially fucked <span class="posthilit">for</span> decades from all the lawyer fees.<br /><br />Think I'm overdramatising?  I've actually been to court vs. the state of California (this was back in 1996 or so).  I will not discuss the nature of the case or the situation -- my point is that I speak from experience.  This is <span class="posthilit">what</span> <span class="posthilit">a</span> person risks by doing that.  Of course, there's the chance the employer will say &quot;lol whatever&quot; and turn <span class="posthilit">a</span> blind eye, but if <span class="posthilit">you</span> signed <span class="posthilit">what</span> <span class="posthilit">you</span> signed, legally they can screw <span class="posthilit">you</span>.<br /><br />TL;DR -- Keep work at work, keep home (e.g. hobbies) at home.

Examples include front desk receptionist during the graveyard shift or (in this case) an underemployed engineer.

Or is there some prevailing corporate best practice to always deny such requests?

Not quite that bad, but <span class="posthilit">you</span> all seem to have big boy jobs that would make me lose my mind!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />I have two part time jobs, one <span class="posthilit">for</span> the luvs, the other <span class="posthilit">for</span> the bills.<br /><br />First is at <span class="posthilit">a</span> Comic Shop. I LOVE it. I've always loved comics, and <span class="posthilit">for</span> <span class="posthilit">a</span> time (i still <span class="posthilit">do</span>) was actively trying to write them. (Unable to draw <span class="posthilit">a</span> straight line with <span class="posthilit">a</span> ruler, or pay <span class="posthilit">a</span> decent artist <span class="posthilit">a</span> fee was <span class="posthilit">a</span> hinderance.) In any regards, my interest in that lead me to read alot about how the industry works, the viewpoints and needs of creators, publishers, distributors and retailers. As such I became really good friends with the owner, and as soon as I got back into playing Magic the Gathering he had convinced me to run the tournaments and with that it just kinda slowly took over. I started doing the orders <span class="posthilit">for</span> magic, then board games. I started putting in more hours, instituted <span class="posthilit">a</span> POS system, and have helped the owner with comic orders (He's <span class="posthilit">a</span> generation older than me, so he's kinda out of touch with <span class="posthilit">what</span>'s &quot;hot&quot; today). I've basically become his 2nd hand, going to retailer summits at conventions and helping him institute pop culture signings (We recently had Jeremy Bulloch who played Boba Fett, and are getting Ray Parks who played Darth Maul, and hopefully getting Christopher Llyod who played Doc Brown in Back to the Future. Pretty cool, since we're <span class="posthilit">a</span> not super large town in Iowa!) As <span class="posthilit">you</span> can probably tell it's exciting and I love it, but it pays crap  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  (Comic shops, despite the popularity of the movies, are not super profitable. We have to compete with places like amazon and their profit margins are too low to get buy. This is further compounded by the fact that our stock is not returnable and theirs is. I could go into more depth, but that's probably the biggest issue.)<br /><br />My 2nd job is doing desktop support at an aerial mapping company. I got it through total nepotism, haha.  My friend worked there and he's <span class="posthilit">a</span> Linix/Server guy and they needed someone part time to help out with desktop support <span class="posthilit">for</span> Windows since that's the whole office and it was consuming too much of his time. I had actually gone to college <span class="posthilit">for</span> IT with these certified Cisco courses. It was fun, but it became clear after the first year that i really didn't want to <span class="posthilit">do</span> <span class="posthilit">what</span> they were aiming <span class="posthilit">for</span>, managing servers and databases all day. I took <span class="posthilit">a</span> programming class and it drove me mad, haha. No offense guys, I'm in total awe of your power, but it's too structured <span class="posthilit">for</span> me, if that's even the right word. Anyways, i really loved working with hardware though, had been building computers from spare parts since i was in the 5th grade at home. I finished up the courses and thought i would get <span class="posthilit">a</span> job fixing computers but that didn't happen. So there i was <span class="posthilit">a</span> decade later and took <span class="posthilit">a</span> job doing <span class="posthilit">what</span> i didn't want to <span class="posthilit">do</span>! It hasn't been too bad. I don't deal with the server stuff, mostly just fixing blue screens, and driver problems, other basic user stuff. I did however about <span class="posthilit">a</span> year ago get the opportunity to fix some monitors! I had to learn to solder, and replace caps and it was tons of fun! since then I've fixed <span class="posthilit">a</span> dozen or so tv's or monitors <span class="posthilit">for</span> friends and family and it's lead me here! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br /><br />Now as <span class="posthilit">for</span> the topic of doing hobby stuff at work, in my experience it can largely be affected by How well <span class="posthilit">you</span> and your boss know each other, and how well he understands <span class="posthilit">what</span> it is <span class="posthilit">you</span> are actually doing. Most Managers have <span class="posthilit">a</span> mind set of needing to cut money where ever they can, even if it's not necessary. They DON'T want to pay someone create <span class="posthilit">a</span> product on company dime that won't profit them. Also if they don't understand <span class="posthilit">what</span> <span class="posthilit">you</span> are doing, they could easily fear that it's malicious.

It's <span class="posthilit">a</span> pretty significant risk.<br /><br />And, hey, maybe it's <span class="posthilit">a</span> risk worth taking. It depends on the situation-- tepples was just coming at it speculatively, I think, but the kind of stipulations <span class="posthilit">you</span> get in <span class="posthilit">a</span> lot of work contracts very often take explicit ownership of stuff like this, and depending on the company it could be <span class="posthilit">a</span> huge risk to try and <span class="posthilit">do</span> stuff like this on the clock. (Under <span class="posthilit">a</span> lot of contracts, it's <span class="posthilit">a</span> risk to <span class="posthilit">do</span> this kind of stuff at home too. Last time I was looking <span class="posthilit">for</span> <span class="posthilit">a</span> job, I turned down an otherwise decent offer because they wanted ownership of my creative output at home as well as at work. It may sound weird, but I know <span class="posthilit">a</span> ton of people that have accepted contracts like this.)</div><br /><br />I'm pretty sure thats not legally enforceable. Not that <span class="posthilit">you</span> wouldn't have to take it to court to prove it, but still - just because its in <span class="posthilit">a</span> contract doesn't mean its enforceable. <span class="posthilit">For</span> example, in california I'm 100% sure that is totally illegal <span class="posthilit">for</span> them to <span class="posthilit">do</span> whether <span class="posthilit">you</span> signed it or not.
