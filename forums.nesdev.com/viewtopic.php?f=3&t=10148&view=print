Translating a game from a system into a native binary of another system can help the target system to run said game under limited resources or processing power, and still deliver (mostly) accurate playing experience of the original game. Though of course most modern platforms (computers, smartphones, TV sets, refrigerators, whatever, etc.) are capable enough to have a Famicom emulator, this concept may be applied to games originally designed for more demanding systems (e.g. arcade games, games for more &quot;next-gen&quot; consoles) that lower-end modern devices are still struggling to emulate accurately (even in the case of Famicom games, running a Famicom emulator on a modern smartphone can drain your battery in no time). In fact, as far as I have heard, apart from purely emulated games (such as Nintendo's Virtual Console, those old games in PSX store, etc.) some accurate arcade ports for recent consoles (by recent I meant from Playstation/Saturn onwards) are actually done by abstracting the original arcade systems into components, emulating logical components such as graphic and sound generation like the original boards, so that the games can use directly the data files of the original systems, but instead of emulating the CPU (could be one of the most demanding part, especially during the PS1 &amp; PS2 eras and recompilers weren't that common) the code part was completely refactored into native codes of the target system (either by reverse engineering/decompiling/deassembling the ROM files, or if the developer happened to possess the source code of the original game they could just recompile it for the target system). This is similar to how some people made SMB to run on the Mega Drive by using the deassembled codes of the game.

At various points in the history of Apple's App Store, iPhone and iPad were examples of such platforms. Or a game is being ported to a platform that can only run programs written in one language. Xbox 360 is like this: unless you have tens of thousands of dollars and a relationship with an established publisher of disc games, you have to stick to Xbox Live Indie Games, which requires all games to be written in C# using the XNA framework, and for various reasons, XNA isn't exactly designed to be an emulator host. (The actual requirement is no native code, no unsafe constructions, and no Reflection.Emit, but no unsafe constructions rules out languages like standard C++, and no Reflection.Emit rules out IronPython.) It's not quite as necessary on a platform like Ouya, where both emulators written in Java and emulators using the NDK should work.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: Errors are made.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Fairly pointless in practice, but looked like a fun learning experience to see how LLVM worked and such. Long as he had fun making it, it doesn't bother me.<br /><br />But yeah, the answer was obvious from the beginning. The more accurate you get, the more optimizations you lose, and eventually a theoretically perfect static recompiler would end up with enough dynamic hooks (like generating instructions from 6502 code placed in RAM) that it's effectively equivalent to a traditional emulator anyway. Only much more complex for likely no speed benefit.<br /><br />Traditionally, static recompilation is just one more way to cut corners for speedups. Which is great if you're writing a game emulator for limited resources. Not so great if you want compatibility with any theoretically valid software program.

I'm not sure of any using static recompilation, though things like jump tables and such can easily fool recompilers (otherwise disassemblers wouldn't have any issues reverse engineering any program all on their own *sigh*).
