		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think it'd be much better to focus on ways to make the (vastly more capable) OLPC cheaper, and thus more widely available, than to hack up a 25-year-old video game system. Architectural limitations aside, wouldn't the latter require a separate TV for each unit? Along with increasing the overall price, it kind of throws the OLPC's goals for portability, power efficiency, durability, and aesthetics right out the window.
<br />
<br />I think maybe nostalgia is clouding these guys' better judgment. The average household in the poorest third-world countries is still a far cry from the average American household of the 80's, and I don't think giving them a bunch of TVs and Chinese game consoles is going to change much.

<br />
<br />The last time I strolled the mud households in Egypt, many MANY households had a television &amp; famiclone, &amp; in the cities it wasn't uncommon to see 8-bit computers.  It was like 5 years ago, back when I was collecting 2600 stuff rather than NES, so I don't remember &amp; didn't  really care to look what the 8-bit computers where clones of / based off of.
<br />
<br />Egypt was &amp; is a sozialist state, so it follows the cliche of large cities &amp; poor mud villages, etc...
<br />
<br />yeah...

<br />
<br />Without some form of cheap rewritable storage media I don't see how this computer will be too useful.  With out a floppy or cassette it is harder (aka more expensive) to store documents, write new programs, or distribute programs.  Sure it has a cart slot but thats not useful for starving marvin to send a program he wrote to his friend.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />SD cards can be operated with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus" class="postlink">SPI bus</a>, which has four signals:
<br /><ul><li>clock </li><li>host out </li><li>device out </li><li>chip select </li></ul>Three of these map fairly cleanly to NES controller port 2:<br /><ul><li>clock = CLK </li><li>host out = OUT </li><li>device out = D4 </li></ul>
<br />This leaves chip select (/CS) as the major remaining problem. The NES ordinarily leaves both controllers selected at once and clocks one of them at a time. Perhaps the SD interface could reconstruct /CS by requiring the host to clock (read $4017) a few times first.
<br />
<br />The "expansion port", on the other hand, has a few more signals that can be used.
