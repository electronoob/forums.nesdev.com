OAM cycling is a bit weird for me, because sometimes I need to preserve the priorities between the sprites of an object (and sometimes even between different objects). To solve this, instead of "randomizing" the sprite slots, I randomize the order in which the objects are processed and rendered. I'm not sure if this looks better or worse than the other way, I haven't tested it much.<br /><br />I also have 2 virtual sprite layers. When objects call the sprite rendering function they specify whether the sprites should go on the top layer or the bottom layer. This causes the function to output the sprites to the bottom end or to the top end of the OAM buffer ($200-$2FF). Since the top layer has priority, I avoid putting sprites there unless they absolutely need to be in front of all other objects.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Nov 10, 2011 11:29 am</p><hr />

The other way, as used by Super Mario Bros. series, is to make each map a list of (x, y, thing) tuples: one byte for x and y, and one for what's at that location: it could be a block, a row of blocks, etc. If you can draw concepts for later maps, I might help you figure out what kind of map representation would work best.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Mar 24, 2011 7:12 am</p><hr />

This is pretty cool! You may find <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7579" class="postlink">this thread</a> of interest for background collisions. I recently struggled with this myself. For your game you won't have gravity, and your velocities may be constant, but the sequence of steps needed for correct background collision and response is there.<br /><br />Also I admire someone that can come up with a good, unique idea for a game and implement it without a mapper.

Cool, more homebrew stuff.  Always good to see people having fun and making stuff no matter how simple/weird.  Well, except for tepples, who is just downright weird.  ;-)<br /><br />Also, something technical: your format for the gamebackground data could be significantly compressed without using RLE or anything as well.  I don't know what range of values you need (in your example you're only using $0 to $2), but I'll assume you need values $0-$F (0-15).

Something to think about, especially given the ROM space savings per screen.<br /><br />Of course, if you actually need more than a nybble ($0-$F) for your tile numbers this won't work.  In that case you might consider a simple RLE method.  What I used in the FF2e/j intro was pretty simple and made a huge difference when there were lots of repetitive tiles of the same value.  Had to use this in my case since there wasn't enough free ROM space.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Thu Mar 24, 2011 6:24 am</p><hr />
