What I've used is this roll of extremely thin label-protection protection tape.  I bought it a while back off someone who was using it to make NES cart labels, I forget who.  It's thicker than what the original labels used, but from looking at it I think it's the exact same stuff.  It's polypropylene, uv resistant, and has an acid-free adhesive.  The thickness makes it look a little more shiny, but I think it would be a little more durable maybe.  It's not the easiest stuff to work with, but it looks cool.  <a href="http://www.parodius.com/~memblers/nes/squeedo/pics/testlabel-angle.jpg" class="postlink">http://www.parodius.com/~memblers/nes/squeedo/pics/testlabel-angle.jpg</a>  Of course the paper underneath is matte (and inkjet, but I think this stuff protects it enough from water if you use a safe adhesive).<br /><br />I know somewhere recently there was a drawing made of the NES cart board dimensions.  I thought it got put in the wiki.<br /><br />edit: well it was on the wiki, but the links are dead. <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_cartridge_dimensions" class="postlink">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_cartridge_dimensions</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Mar 31, 2010 7:35 pm</p><hr />

right. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> i'm talking about a gloss laminate top layer, as opposed to a glossy paper. i'd guess that they all used paper labels at the time, i don't think any were vinyl back then. to sum it up though, i don't think the SMB2 label was any different than the others. i'm sorry that i don't have any carts here to compare.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4315">jbuonacc</a> — Wed Mar 31, 2010 5:31 pm</p><hr />

"Gloss" does not mean != Paper, you know. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />It just means that it has a coating applied to the paper.  As for the "Leprosy" look, let me find a picture of such a label...<br /><br />*edit<br /><br />Damn people refusing to own up to having marred carts.  I can't find any except for "Extreme" cases, like where somebody tried to peel a label off. <br /><br />The "leprosy" look is best imagined as to what would happen if you attacked the label with 500 grit sandpaper, and partially sanded through the color layer. (small islands of discoloration where the paper texture of the label has created raised areas that got ablated by friction.) The result is a sort of "Patchy" appearance to the sticker, and a loss of gloss.<br /><br />This weekend I will visit the flea market and bring my camera. (Wichita has Kansas's Larges flea market in it. It is only open on weekends though. There are at least 3 used games dealers that are regularly there.)<br /><br /> I'll look for some lepritic carts then. (probably buy one for up-close examination. It seems that the detailed physical information about NES carts and cartridge system boards is dead-linked in the wiki to a dead go-daddy domain. Means the information needs to be re-created. Since I am the one asking, I might as well...)<br /><br />In the meantime, yes-- we did derail.

I dunno.. I remember that SMB2 had a paper label. (as opposed to a vinyl label)<br /><br />the problem manifests when storing the carts on a shelf that is tightly packed, like storing hard cover books. (the problem is lessened by using the plastic dust sleeves, but those are hard to find these days, short of a trip to a flea market.) This causes the paper to get "scratched" as the carts are rubbed against each other, resulting in the "Leprosy" look. (then there is always the issue with smokers in the house... I am fairly sure that retrobrite would be bad news on the paper labels.)<br /><br />The whole issue would have been easily corrected by reducing the depth of the label area 1mm, then filling the space with a clear plastic insert after the label was put on.  Granted, then the clear plastic window would get scratched up, but that is replaceable. The label is not.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4301">Wierd_w</a> — Wed Mar 31, 2010 3:35 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Wierd_w wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />... Most of the problem with NES carts was that the labels were just colored glossy paper, which gets eroded over time, and the cart ends up looking like it has leprosy.
