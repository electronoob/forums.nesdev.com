<br />He talked about the PowerPak Lite before.  As I recall, it's an SRAM-based cartridge programmed through CopyNES that supports (I believe) 8 mappers.  It's essentially a stripped-down version of the PowerPak for those who have CopyNES and don't want to shell out the money for the high-end version.

The distinction between a reproduction and a counterfeit is a reproduction presents itself as not the real thing, while a counterfeit tries to fool consumers into thinking that it is the real thing.  Considering that the reproduction of the NWC uses a plastic cart shell and PCB that both look very different from the real thing, it is definitely not a counterfeit.
<br />
<br />But how can they sell copies of the NWC software, which is surely copyrighted by Nintendo?

<br />This reproduction (and ALL repros) is illegal because of the copyrighted code.  Even translations are illegal, they still contain the majority of the original copyrighted program.  If Nintendo complained I would have to shut it down immediately.  The damages would be debateable because it was never for sale publically but the copyright still stands.

Back then you were making them with 3rd party SNES controller clones.  Earlier this year I bought two NES RetroPorts, which I like much better than the Retropads, as they don't involve destroying classic hardware.  The emulation crowd would love RetroPorts that supported direct access to the raw peripherial data, so that support could be added for any console peripherial, via emulation software.  Again, just an idea for another product that you could mark the price up on and sell it as a "pro" version, while all you have to do is change the firmware.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">bunnyboy wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">This reproduction (and ALL repros) is illegal because of the copyrighted code.

<br />
<br />You might want to re-think how you approach the reproduction business, so that you can sell reproductions without violating copyright.  If your reproduction business functioned as a Kinkos, where you merely let customers "print" their ROMs to carts, then you can have the customer email you the ROM they want printed... placing the copyright burden on them.
<br />
<br />Since you are a USB expert, for a future product, consider making full fledged console copiers, like the old SNES copiers.  A RetroZone copier could be shaped like a Game Genie with a USB port, which supports USB drives as well as direct linking with a PC.

<br />It is a risk bunnyboy is willing to take.  Unless Nintendo plans on releasing the NWC on the Wii Virtual Console, the risk is arguably very small since Nintendo isn't likely to suffer much in terms of damages.  If Nintendo does complain, bunnyboy could theoretically ask for permission to sell the cart and share the profits therefrom with Nintendo (not that Nintendo would go for such a deal, but there's no reason he can't ask).  I wouldn't ask Nintendo first, though, as it will grab their attention which otherwise may never come about.
<br />
<br />The Ciclone chip is also a potential for legal action, but again I doubt Nintendo would bother because they wouldn't have much to gain.

<br />Did they really sell out that fast?  Or are they simply not available yet?  Here is the link in question:

<br />Please give us a heads up before you start selling the PowerPak.  I'll cry if I miss the first batch  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  Also, another idea for a NES related product would be a new motherboard and case for toaster NES / Famicom ICs.  It could be what the NEX should have been, but built using official Nintendo made ICs, ripped from old toaster NES and RF Famicom systems.  The two biggest things that the NES scene has been lacking for all of these years are a good means for playing ROMs on a real system and a console that has all of the benefits of the toaster NES and AV Famicom combined.
