I was pointing that on the PRG0 PAL version, during the last (well, one before last) boss, the whole screen flickers completely (the tiles that are supposed to be the ground shows up on the top every other frame I guess), and I was saying this is REALLY unacceptable (as opposed to little glitch tokumaru mentions).
<br />
<br />You seem to like to talk about financial things. Is it right that Capcom would "spend" thousands to have employees fix the minor glitch above Shadow Man's face ? Put that way, yeah it's accetpable. But is it right that a player spends I have no idea how much for a game that is not beatable because the whole screen flicker on the last boss, because Capcom's employees didn't port the game to PAL proprely ? No it's not - I want to buy functional games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Bregalad: You are right. Tokumaru was talking about "small glitches" and saying that was unacceptable. I am quite sure Disch (I've read that the C is for Cool) was responding to him, not your statements about the PAL version which I agree are unacceptable. I am also responding to such statements about smaller things.
<br />
<br />Edit: No wait. I reread it. My bad. He addressed PAL as well. He's on his own there.
<br />
<br />Edit 2: Since I don't think a video of the PAL version of this glitch was posted, and to make amends about my mistake about Disch's intentions, I offer this: <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/MegaMan3_eu_SS_4808" class="postlink">This is what we're dealing with at (47:00)</a> (No need to download, there's a streamed one)

<br /><div class="quotetitle">Disch wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I see people on these boards talking about how they wouldn't be satisfied if <em>one pixel</em> was out of place in a scene.</div>

<br />I'm reminded of the single wrong pixel in EarthBound. 
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img824.imageshack.us/img824/381/pixeloutofplace.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />I must have played through the game 10 times before I even saw it. Someone else must have noticed it because it was fixed in Mother 1 + 2 on GBA. 
<br />
<br />I'm pretty anal about little imperfections in the game I'm working on now. A lot of what's in my current known "bug list" are things the player would not notice, or would write off as a one-off thing. (For instance landing on a very specific pixel in between two specific slope heights would force the player slightly to the left and up. I know it's there, and it's still really tough to do.) I'm not anal about it because I think the end user will be bothered, though. I'm anal because it bothers ME as the creator of the game. If I had a deadline, you can bet I'd stop caring about that kind of thing, and move onto the big stuff. 
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;if you don't want to read a lot about bigger glitches<br />&nbsp; jmp postshorten</div><br /><br />I'm actually really forgiving about glitches in other games. I understand they had deadlines and all that. And I love glitches and oversights. When I heard about the debug functions on player 2's controller? My first thought was, "AWESOME! I GOTTA TRY IT!" The wrong scanline? I noticed it, but didn't care, just like I don't care about the wrong pixel in EarthBound. To me it's funny. Something to giggle about and tell your friends. I think a lot of gamers are like that. It might be a programmer's mindset that looks on these things with disdain. But look up a video of someone who's discovered some glitch. They're laughing about it. These things happen. Crashes? Sure, that's unacceptable. It totally frustrates the end user. Bad code that makes the game more difficult than it'd be if it was done correctly? Also unacceptable. Glitches that affect multiplayer? Also pretty bad. People then get into fights about whether or not to use the glitches, and that also frustrates some of the user base. Single player stuff is fine. It's easier to not use a glitch you know about, than to play against people who won't use it to gain an advantage "for honor". (I like Wavedashing in Smash Bros. Melee. People got frustrated when I did it outside the tourney scene sometimes. Meanwhile there are similar things in other games that I DISLIKE and would rather not use or play against.) Other glitches? Eh... whatever. If it isn't bothering the end user, I don't see it as a problem. (If it's in a game I'm playing and not making)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q7v4F8r9Og" class="postlink">Here's one (Not NES) I'd be embarrassed about if it showed up in a game of mine. But the gamers were not disappointed a bit. They're having fun with the oddity.</a> <br /><br />Minor graphical things don't even phase me. The first game I noticed NES' tiles being the wrong color on the sides of the screen was in Kirby's Adventure. It wasn't even the first time I played it. I just... noticed it one day. I thought it was interesting. Now that I know how much trouble they would have had to go through to make it NOT happen, I don't hold it against them, not that I ever did. The same goes to scanline issues in Megaman. (Not the PAL version by the way. I would have been put off even as a youngster.)<br /><br />I don't think the developers did a terrible job when glitches are found, even game breaking ones like invincibility in Battle Kid, or screen warping in Link's Awakening. I can't say whether or not I'd have avoided creating those glitches if I had been in the position to make either game, but I can say with CERTAINTY, I would not have found them through play testing. So it's totally forgivable.<br /><br />Whenever I hear about a glitch, I think, "Well, okay, why does this happen? How can I avoid it in my game?" I don't mind, because I might have made the same mistake, if they hadn't made it first. Even when I young, I loved glitches, and trying to figure out why they did what they did. I can get game cube's Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3/Sonic the Hedgehog/Super Mario 64 DS/Yoshi's Island (well... kinda)/many others to consistently crash and while that's bad, I have to be TRYING to make it happen.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">postshorten:</div>
<br />
<br />I can see nonstandard (so tile attribute NES stuff/sprite flickering doesn't count etc. It comes with the territory) graphical problems during fairly normal gameplay in Ristar/Earthbound (above, heh)/Sonic 3&amp;K/Pokemon Red and Blue/Super Mario Bros. 2/Super Mario World (I'd have to double check that one)/others and I have never been bothered by them. It's kinda like in a sitcom how sometimes the microphone above the actors drops into the camera's view. It happens. 
<br />
<br />When you guys worried about this MM3 scanline thing see this stuff, is your first reaction really one of (seeming) disgust? If so, dang, I guess I really do need to fix every little thing to please you. I'm pretty sure most people aren't like that, but that thought worries me...

<br />
<br />In MM4, the "shooting" sound is off, as is teleport, and especially the "charge" sound.  During Dust Man's level the scrolling area is handled identically to the NTSC version, buggy scanline and all, but not flickering madly.

<br />This is why I'm gradually abandoning software development as a form of income. Several times I had to settle for less quality because of deadlines, and I don't feel good with myself because of that. I'll try to use programming exclusively as a hobby, so that I have full control of what I do, without ever having to settle for less because of others.

<br /><div class="quotetitle">RushJet1 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">In the MM3 PAL vid i noticed some weird stuff.  More of the Wily map song plays than in the NTSC version</div>
<br />That's probably a side effect of fixing the music's tempo... it plays at the same speed as the NTSC version, but the rest of the program runs slower because delays, distances and such weren't adapted for the slower frame rate, so as a consequence the music gets out of sync with the video. Most of the time this isn't a problem, but there are a few timed events that will expose this.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure, as a game developer, of what would be the best way to handle this. If you adapt everything that's related to gameplay (delays, distances, etc) to PAL, the game might play at the same apparent speed, but it might end up behaving differently because of fixed-point rounding errors. And there are some aspects that are tied to the frame rate because of VBlank use (such as CHR-RAM updates) that wouldn't work even if the timing was fixed. Of course PAL has a longer VBlank and could easily accommodate video updates for 2 frames, but the logic to handle that would not be trivial, and RAM usage would increase significantly.
<br />
<br />All of that was to say that I can't think of a good way to make NTSC and PAL versions of the same game play exactly the same (from a player's perspective). But this is probably a subject for another thread.

<br />I once managed to fix every single one that ever existed in mm3 originally. 
<br />
<br />yea basically every single IRQ the game has, has cycle timining issues or whatever. I eventually found out how to fix every single one 100% purely perfect so none of that little pixel shaking stuff would ever happen in any major battles and such. 
<br />
<br />I dont remember what i had done though since it was a few years ago. I think it was usually simply changing what scanline number the irq happens at by 1 scanline up or down, which would fix most or all of them.

<br />Well I'm not saying you're wrong, but a small graphical glitch or lack thereof isn't what makes a game good or bad. Capcom always tried their best to make very good games - and didn't want them to be just "good enough". Okay I know there is also some bad games from Capcom, but Mega Man 3 is objectively a very good game. The fact there is some graphical glitches is a shame - especially for the PAL version - but it doesn't prevent the game from being very good. If you're still hesitant about it, play AD&amp;D - Heroes of the Lance, Action 52, Ghost busters, or and you'll see what I mean.
<br />
<br />However, now that I've throught about it - Dish' reasonment that "Capcom didn't want to pay $xxxx for fixing the glitch" doesn't hold very well. If you'd think like that - you might say you don't want to pay $xxxx for having a lot of music tunes, and compose only a song for the whole game. Then you don't want to pay $xxxx to have different graphics in different levels, so you only have one tileset. Etc, etc.. and it ends up like Ghostbusters.
<br />
<br />Video games are in the gray zone - they're art but still an industry.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wow the PAL version of Mega Man 3's boss glitch is terrible. I would say that is unacceptable behavior. While I disagree that it makes the sequence impossible to complete, it certainly is annoying. As I said before, minor graphical glitches are acceptable to a point. Even modern games have them.
<br />
<br />I think that Capcom should have spent the money to fix the PAL version of MM3, or atleast improve it. But the NTSC version clearly didn't need the extra polish. Also leaving the P2 controller debug cheats on was not a huge deal. I suppose it's not very professional but it's realistic to how mistakes can be made when there are deadlines. 
<br />
<br />I don't think your comparison with 1 song holds up well. That is related to game play standards of the day. A game with just 1 song in MM3's time frame would not be acceptable. Ultimately whoever decided not to spend extra time on fixing the minor glitches (or in PAL major) probably was nothing more than a management person who asked, how much more time would you need? And given they answers they got they said no we aren't doing it.

<br />Come again? No PAL MM1/MM2 cart or ROM image I've ever encountered has showed any PAL fixing. MM3 I can't remember honestly... but none of the early Capcom games I know of fixed the music, except for the ones where the work was outsourced to other companies. (Ghost n' Goblins by Micronics comes to mind, just wish they had spent some more time fixing visual glitches instead before the deadline ;)

<br />
<br />If you take it to extremes, of course it no longer makes sense.
<br />
<br />If they didn't want to pay $xxxx to make the game at all, they would just be selling empty cartridges.
<br />
<br />The company has to choose where it's going to spend money.  Sometimes there isn't enough money to fix every single problem.  So you have to prioritize and pick which problems are most severe.
<br />
<br />Apparently the execs thought that money was better spent elsewhere in the game than on fixing a few graphical glitches.  Or maybe the developers simply ran out of time.

Sometimes there isn't enough money to fix every single problem. So you have to prioritize and pick which problems are most severe. <br /><br />Apparently the execs thought that money was better spent elsewhere in the game than on fixing a few graphical glitches. Or maybe the developers simply ran out of time.</div>
<br />I fully understand that. Another point is that Capcom's programmer likely didn't have half of the knowledge of the NES hardware that we have - and had no idea of how the PPU was fetching tiles. They just figured that writes to $2006 could change the tile shown and exploited that in their games.
<br />Other comanies (Squaresoft, Rare) obviously took more time to examine the NES hardware and it's tricks (so they probably took the choice to pay employees to do that). That doesn't necessary make them do better games, but games that exploit more the hardware.

<br />Swiss watch makers can get away with charging luxury prices for the level of engineering that goes into a luxury product because there's definitely a segmented market between a Rolex and the Casio on my wrist. Video games, on the other hand, have a nearly uniform retail price. Except for games that come with dedicated controllers, virtually no game disc for a current console costs more than 60 USD per copy (excl. VAT) in the United States.

When he played the second Dr. Wily boss in Megaman 5 that you use two sections of its body as platforms, the sections stayed in place but the collision still worked, so he had to fight the boss blind.  I'm guessing the mapper hardware was faulty and the scanline irq didn't trigger.
