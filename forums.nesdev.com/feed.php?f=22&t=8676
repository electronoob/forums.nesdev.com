I'm guessing that because most mapper 0 boards didn't have PRG RAM at $6000-$7FFF, the emulator should emulate open bus at $6000-$7FFF. Family BASIC is a mapper 0 game with PRG RAM there, but its PRG RAM is smaller than 8 KiB, so that might be what you're seeing. If you want to force a particular PRG RAM size, use an <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0" class="postlink">NES 2.0 header</a>.<br /><br />Anyway, you can't count on an emulator or even the actual hardware to initialize RAM to $00, $FF, or any other known value when creating the .sav file.

Great job!<br /></div><br /><br />Thanks a lot!   <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">infiniteneslives wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />This is what it looks like everytime I die on FCEUX and the NES as well.  It's not an issue of things being saved after power down, it's an issue of not being able to get them to save in the first place.  When I play the non-battery version it works fine on both the NES and FCEUX.  I'm Thinking it might be an issue of the RAM initialization data.  Nestopia assumes one thing and FCEUX and I initialize differently?!<br /></div><br /><br />It works with the newer FCEUX 2.1.5 - also with the older FCEUXDSP. But not with 2.1.4a for some strange reason. I couldn't find a detailed changelog for 2.1.4a&gt;2.1.5 so I did a lot of testing. I looked inside the hex editor of FCEUX 2.1.4a during runtime and saw that the PRGRAM location is changing the bytes in a constant interval (but only if you do something inside the endless loop, e.g. loading a byte into the accumulator). I wonder why. It does the same when PRGRAM bit is not set, so I assume it just ignores the wram bit at byte 6 for the NROM mapper while the new version accepts it? But what is the PRGRAM location used for if there is no PRGRAM? I didn't found any info on this.<br />For example, taking this very simple example:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">  .db &quot;NES&quot;, $1A<br />  .db $01, $01, %00000010<br />  .db $00, $00, $00<br />  .db $00, $00, $00<br />  .db $00, $00, $00<br /><br />  .org $C000<br /><br />NMI:<br />  RTI<br />RESET:<br />  SEI<br />  CLD<br />  LDX #$FF<br />  TXS<br /><br />PPUWarmup1:<br />  LDA $2002<br />  BPL PPUWarmup1<br />PPUWarmup2:<br />  LDA $2002<br />  BPL PPUWarmup2<br />  <br />  LDA #$50<br />  STA $6000<br />  STA $7000<br /><br />FOREVER:<br />  LDA #$01<br />  JMP FOREVER<br /><br />  .org $FFFA<br />  .dw NMI, RESET, 0<br /><br />  .base $0000<br />  .dsb $2000, $00</div><br /><br />In this simple case all bytes in PRGRAM switches repeatedly from value $01 to value $C0. In version 2.1.5 it saves $50 in $6000 but not in $7000 (so i would assume that it does only reserve 4kb). My game needs only a couple of bytes in $6000 so that's the reason why it works with 2.1.5. In FCEUXDSP and Nintendulator this works as expected.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4665">Yggi</a> — Mon Mar 05, 2012 2:21 pm</p><hr />

It's not an issue of things being saved after power down, it's an issue of not being able to get them to save in the first place.  When I play the non-battery version it works fine on both the NES and FCEUX.  I'm Thinking it might be an issue of the RAM initialization data.  Nestopia assumes one thing and FCEUX and I initialize differently?<br /><br /><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18341918/pogo_cats_death.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />No offense, but I think it's silly to use batteries to save high score.<br /></div><br /><br />You realize he made a version that doesn't save right?  So if you don't like the save feature he implemented than you can use the standard one.  The other thing is the real point of playing this game is to get a high score, not an adventure killing off baddies and getting points you don't care about in the process.  So to me it makes sense if you really enjoyed playing the game to somehow be able to permanently save your high score.  Who cares if you "waste" data space or 8KB of WRAM and battery to do it, it's your CHOICE to use them or not. I for one am very happy you chose to implement this option because it gives me a chance to test some things out on my hardware.  <br /><br />Also as far as the game goes I wanted to say it looks really good and clean I like the graphics and artwork.  I also like the mechanics and physics of the game especially those tornadoes!  It was also a nice touch to have the background move up and down when they jump and land it has a nice way of giving the illusion of jumping.  Great job!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Mon Mar 05, 2012 10:13 am</p><hr />

When I play in nestopia everything works as I guess you're hoping seeing the value for the highscore.<br /><br />I'm not sure if fceux doesn't recognize the wram in mapper 0 but I would think that it does.  Also for what it's worth I didn't put any logic in for what your header was, I just used the code above for all times in mapper 0.  So I'm not sure fceux is more accurate here and that's why I'm seeing the same this as it or if it's just a coincidence and we're both broken.<br /></div><br /><br />Not sure if I did unterstand you correctly (my english is bad). Do you mean there is a visible glitch inside the main screen? If so, could you tell where exactly this happens? I didn't have any problems with fceux .<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">miker00lz wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />it's a fun game, but after a few minutes it gets a little repetitive<br /></div><br /><br />Thanks for the feedback.

The NES standard is that either you have a lot of data to save, then you use battery, either you don't and you use passwords, and if you just have highscores, the standard is to init them to 5000 (or another value, it doesn't matter), and then have them reset-presistant so that the high scores are preserved when you reset the game, but lost when you turn it off.<br /></div><br /><br />The battery-version is just for emulator-users to avoid the use of save states. If I'll do a cartidge version I would probably make just a simple NROM-cart.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4665">Yggi</a> — Mon Mar 05, 2012 9:32 am</p><hr />
