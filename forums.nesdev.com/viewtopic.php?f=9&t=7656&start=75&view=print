<br />
<br />This mapper sounds like a good one for developers to have more options. I hope you succeed. No mapper is going to please everyone as there will always be some features missing that someone wants. As you said it's a nice upgrade over mappers 1 and 2.

<br />Care to take a look at the Verilog and help us out? It's all open-source <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nesdev1/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fmappers" class="postlink">Web SVN Link to Mappers Directory</a>
<br />
<br />The registers by themselves fit just fine, but the logic takes up quite a few as well. Again this is my first Verilog design, and I really do not know what I'm doing here  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />

<br />I am begining to think that using a new mapper is a flaw in the plan. It might be best to develop a dev board compatible with the already available production carts from RetroZone. That way we can leverage the production scale and services that RetroZone offers.
<br />
<br />As long as I can fit DIP sockets on the thing for sel-programming I think this would work out quite well. Thoughts?

<br />What sense does that make? I don't know about everyone else, but to me the whole appeal was the more capable mapper, not the fact that this is a "development system".

<br />
<br />Yup.
<br />
<br />However, every project has to start someplace.  Getting a 1.0 project into beta, polished and shipped is an important step in making a 2.0 project.  Although some of us would like to see a more capable mapper, it might be more beneficial to qbradq to focus on <strong><em>_a_</em></strong> mapper first (instead of many different ones).

<br />Again, a new mapper would require plug-ins for debugging emulators on all major PC platforms. Being "compatible" with an existing emulator is a means toward not needing to make new plug-ins.

<br />
<br />I'm sure the full FME7 will fit into a '144 (I tried it again and I fit a 1M/1M FME7 into a 108), you just need to see what the "platform" (hardware) implementation view or whatever shows and rework and rework until it's decent.
<br />
<br />I think this project should be a XC95144XL TQ144 w/ 2x 32-pin sockets (for &lt;=27c080), 2x 28-pin sockets (for &lt;= 62256) + LDO linear regulator.

<br />So you cripple the mapper instead? Why not contact FCEUX or Nintendulator crew to help with this.
