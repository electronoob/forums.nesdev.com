<br />not yet but i will try it at weekend.
<br />Could u also explain me why when the PowerPak loads the rom, the first time appears "bad filesize or checksum" and on the second try it works?

I also have a SanDisk Extreme III 4GB 30MB/s card, but it doesn't work with FAT or FAT32 formatting. That's not a huge issue though. 
<br />
<br />Prior to the 1.03 update, however, none of my cards worked. I assumed that I had a faulty PowerPak, but apparently it had something to do with my SNES. My SNES is not a mini so I thought that it was strange it wasn't working. It's an NTSC American SNES with 2/1/3. In any case though, it's fixed now. 
<br />
<br />On a side note, would it be possible to add Pro Action Replay cheat support in a later firmware? I understand that more ROM addresses can be modified with the Pro Action Replay than the Game Genie. If not, it's not a problem. Game Genie codes definitely beat Gold Finger codes. Thanks for your hard work!

<br />Ah, my mistake. That makes sense. It was late and I didn't pay attention to my statement. ROM is read only so it can't be changed. Thanks for the clarification.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, I just ordered a PowerPak. Planning to pick it up from my brother's house when I'm in the US in May.
<br />
<br />Given all the SD/CF cards are made here in China, I think I can get several to try cheaper than I could in the US. Hope one in three will work OK assuming they were not ghost-run.
<br />
<br />I had a question about the SNES mini/Jr.
<br />
<br />As of last night (Feb 26) the <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=24&amp;products_id=84" class="postlink">RetroZone</a> page said:
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">System Compatibility List:<ul><li>Works on full size Super Nintendo and Super Famicom systems from </li><li>NTSC and PAL regions with correct lockout.</li><li>Works on the Nintendo SNES mini, aka SNES Jr.</li><li>Works on the RetroDuo and FC Twin clones, no lockout needed.</li><li>Other clones untested, likely to work.</li></ul></div>
<br />
<br />Is this a new update or has it always been there? Given how many problems were reported in this thread with the SNES mini/Jr failing to work, should I assume compatibility is fixed in the latest BIOS?
<br />
<br />Or has bunny just never updated the page to say that console doesn't work?
<br />
<br />Asking because I was planning to take an SNES mini back with me. If it's still known not to work, I'll try to pick up a Japanese Super Famicom on the local second-hand market.

<br />It is indeed fairly new (a month or so ago, I guess); I actually bought mine never expecting to be able to play it on my SFC Jr. There were issues, but they were fixed starting with the 1.03b mapper pack (nothing to do with the BIOS/firmware).  Others have confirmed that it works with the SNES 2, and I have personally confirmed that it works with the Super Famicom Jr. (the Japanese equivalent of the SNES 2).  CF card compatibility is also apparently improving.  So shop with confidence.

<br />
<br />Indeed,
<br />
<br />On my FC 16 GO, the reset button shut down the console.
<br />
<br />But I found a way to be able to save:
<br />
<br />-Press and Hold the ON button
<br />-Now, press and hold the reset button for 4 seconds...
<br />-Release the reset button, the powerpak message prompt for the save appear.
<br />-Navigate where you want to save, validate...
<br />-Then release the ON button, the fc 16 go shuts down, but your save is saved.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Heya,
<br />I bought the SNES powerpak a few weeks ago with the 2gb Dane-Elec CF card that comes with it.
<br />
<br />Sadly, I cant get any of the games to work for more than a few minutes. The cartridge boots fine, seems to copy the selected game without too much trouble. But depending on the game, it either just freezes at some point (black screen) or the graphics glitch out badly.
<br />I have tried with DMA on/off, tried formatting FAT16/32, tried using old mapper versions (though I went back to 1.04 afterwards) and nothing has fixed it.
<br />
<br />Lastly, It doesn't seem like the games always glitch at the same point. I can't tell if its time-related (heat?) or if the rom file has been miscopied. My SNES is a SNES Mini (aka Snes Jr.)
<br />
<br />Any ideas how to fix the problem? Thanks.
<br />
<br />Edit: Also tried using a Transcend 1gb and a Sandisk Extreme III CF card. The former wouldn't boot (FAT16/32 error even though it was in that format) and the latter gave me some weird error (Sectors Left = 1).

<br />Which mappers are you using? Try the latest 1.04 mappers and see if that works. I know that some Sandisk cards have errors with the PowerPak. I've not been able to get my Sandisk Extreme III working. When I first got the PowerPak, none of my three CF cards worked, but after I upgraded to the 1.03 mappers, two out of my three cards have worked.
