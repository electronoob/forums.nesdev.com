		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just got my INL retro dumper and a SXROM flash card. Having trouble with my first session trying to flash the card. <br />So Far:<br />On a XP Home lappy, couldn't run INL retro-prog v1.1beta, 'Failed to Init'. Anago seemed to work, dumped a SNROM PRG but couldn't work out the ram save. But ATM this can wait.<br />Installed on to a XP Pro SP3 PC. Did the Inf generator, INL hardware installed and found in Device Manager.<br />INL retro-prog v1.1beta boots and 'Test' fine. Writing 'Header' with  'erase header.bin' I get 'verify OK'. Changing to '512kB PRG' and loading my 512K PRG bin file, I get 'error 116'. Tried several times, tried reloading INL firmware (worked fine), tried 'shifting' the cart but there really isn't play, tried doing the erase/PRG flash but still getting error 116.<br />Any help would be great<br />Yogi<br />EDIT: well I think I've worked it out. For the erase, set to 'Header' and use the ./ROMS/ERASE_PRG.bin instead of the ./bin-rom images/erase_header.bin. After doing this  the LED went out. Then I set it to '512kb PRG' and loaded my SXROM PRG 512K bin. Write completed with 'Verify OK', Wahoo! now to pop the card into a case and test!!

Thanks for pointing that out, I can see how that would have been confusing.  I pulled that whole folder from the release dir.</div><br />  Well... IF I had read the readme closer I could've avoided the confusion. Really, very cool boards and 'Thank You' for the great work you put into them. The flashing app is clean and simple, very good. Really like'n not having to deal with the Mapper scripts!<br />  Been looking over the V2 board, so very excited seeing the ATMega footprint. Judging from the solder bridges, cart edge uC flashing? In another thread you mentioned mapping the uC onto the data bus @ $5000 and $5001, is this the design? One last question, is the second CPLD need for the uC or can the single CPLD handle the uC address decoding as well as the mapper logic?<br /><br />  I know you don't recommend or support the Anago softs; but I have been trying out the GUI and have found a 'weird-ness' that might be useful to other users that want to manage Saves. <br />  On the Workram page, top and bottom sections for Read and Write. The file browse buttons seem to be reversed. The top one, associated with Read, only allows user to search and select a file. The bottom one for Write, allows the user to name and store a new file. This could be a language/translation issue, but I assume Read to mean 'Read WRAM and store a file', and Write is 'Load a save file and upload to WRAM'. I'll be testing to see what is crossed up.<br />Yogi<br />EDIT: The Workram Read and Write buttons work as expected, but the browse buttons are reversed as noted; so you need to enter the path and name of a new sav file in the Read file window for wram dumps. If you select a existing file in the Saves folder, I think it will overwrite it, but you could select a sav file and edit it with a new name in the file window, before you dump it.<br />  I was testing with a SNROM pak using the MMC1 SUROM script and it dumped a 8K bin, as expected. The bin was test with Nestopia, seemed like a good copy.<br />  Next I need to test the SXROM's 32K ram; the command line tool allows you to specify the # of banks, I.E R4 for the 4-8k banks of the SXROM (if I understand the readme).
