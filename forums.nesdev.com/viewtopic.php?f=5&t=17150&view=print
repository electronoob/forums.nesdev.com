I guess she doesn't take the positives into consideration when she says it needs to be burned to the ground.<br /><br />I mean... compare with certain subreddits which serve to create virtually nothing but spews a lot of intentional hate.<br /><br />I think &quot;concentration camp&quot; was insensitive given the explicit theme along with the pun and that sometimes finesse should trump puns, but to quote what you wrote in another thread:<br /><br />from __past__ import drama.

Besides, aren't you quite active in the hardware subsection? <br />And if you weren't, by comparison i've lurked here since 2008 on and off without registering until recently so i mean.. in that case, i have quite the backlog to contribute myself. <br /><br />Btw guys please don't call people names if you have it in you to avoid it. Meeting &quot;swastika apologist/piece of s...&quot; with &quot;c*nt&quot; isn't the answer, my 2 cents.

Be your own person, Tepples.  Don't change &quot;for&quot; other people, change if *you* feel you become a better person by doing so.  You're an introvert -- harness your introspective nature and ponder it yourself.  You don't need anyone's approval to change or to *not* change.  Be you.<br /><br />Said person has me blocked too.  I don't know why.  And that's OK.  It's their right, and I fully support their right to do so.  I don't feel the need to be everyone's friend.  I'm not going to look at their Twitter profile, or &quot;figure out who they are&quot;, or bother them, or &quot;work things out&quot; (whatever that encompasses).  I respect their privacy, their lifestyle, their right to an opinion, and their right to voice that opinion (without imposing on others) -- no matter if it's the same or different from my own.  But I also am a strong proponent of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtWrljX9HRA" class="postlink">the right to offend</a>, because it's part of responsibly supporting the double-edged sword that is freedom of speech: you have to accept there will be people who say things that you disagree with, or that may even offend you.  I'm perfectly OK with being offended.  I'm OK to listening to an opposing opinion, doing my best to understand the logic behind it, but still saying &quot;I see, well, I guess we just disagree then. Hey, you like tea? Let's get some tea&quot;.<br /><br />In this day and in age (in the United States particularly), we now have a very small -- but extremely vocal -- minority of folks who are &quot;hypersensitive&quot;, &quot;become triggered&quot;, require &quot;safe spaces&quot;, and/or believe in postmodernist thought (the media loves this because it's an infinite supply of drama, and for whatever reason a lot of Americans love drama).  Everyone is welcome to their opinions and right to express them, but I always choose the side of balance and neutrality.  It's why I've always been politically independent, for example.<br /><br />I could pontificate on this subject, especially when it comes to folks who are teenagers or 20-somethings (read: not entirely generational, but rather point-of-time-in-life) and how you learn to hone your opinions + be more selective in where/how you spend your time and energy, but it's extremely off-topic for this board.  And I'd rather spend my energy/time doing other things, especially if my words would fall on deaf ears.  It's part of getting old -- learning how/where/on what to spend your energy.<br /><br />This will be my only reply in the thread.  If you have questions, ask me on Twitter, ask me in a PM, whatever.  I might reply, I might not.  C'est la vie.
