<br />
<br />Well im pretty happy for my first Dev cart 
<br />
<br />
<br />Im posting the pics for you to tell me if i did okay for the MMC1 Chr socket.
<br />&amp; wiring.
<br />
<br />
<br />like i said i recheck what you said &amp; it seem to make sens &amp; i compared again the pins like you told me to
<br />&amp; it was okay
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />there is 2 wire i needed to ''add an extention , solder an other peice of wire &amp; put electrical tape''
<br />
<br />Here is is.

<br />Did they send you a sheet of paper? Somewhere it points to a jumper that has to be changed in order for 29C256's to work.
<br />
<br />Please check the sheet looking for this... Maybe you didn't see it?

<br />I tryed rad racer today
<br />
<br />I had bad graphics on it ...
<br />
<br />metroid the same Thing...
<br />
<br />Broken graphics but i hear the music &amp; can see items moving.....
<br />
<br />I thing maybe it could be 1 bad wire i know maybe which it could be
<br />
<br />could you check the PRG on your cart  ( the right side  first wire the one with 2 connections on the wire  (where does it go exactly? a ground?)
<br />
<br />
<br />I just unsolder my connection to make it connect into the third hole.. (wich was a bent pin (that would be Hole 28 of the PRG chip)
<br />
<br />tell me if it's correct now...
<br />
<br />I retryed it still broken graphic maybe it's the test chips im using .. 
<br />the 29ee010
<br />
<br />let me know
<br />thanks!

And if the tiles are garbled, there certainly is a problem with the CHR socket. You'll have to check again all the rewiring work of the CHR socket.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">i don't know where to look for the problem , that would be mostly a chr prob?</div>
<br />I'd go back to comparing the pinouts, and rewrite the rewiring instructions. Then check if that matches to what was done.
<br />
<br />The problem is definitely in one or more wires of the CHR socket. Double, tripple check it.
<br />
<br />At least, having the PRG running correctly is more than half the job done, since if it didn't run correctly, you couldn't even know if the CHR part was OK.

<br />
<br />I checked my chr tobe sure

<br />Iw as right &amp; you were right
<br />
<br />2 of my wire were miss placed
<br />
<br />so i changed it
<br />
<br />boom Ninja gaiden booted but now....
<br />Im facing an even more Weird problem (the graphic problem is coming after 5 mins of game play....)
<br />
<br />then i just hit the cart on top of my nes &amp; sometimes it comes back ........
<br />
<br />sometime it just dies there... in broken graphics...
<br />this is Really odd
<br />I even changed the Cart so it doesn't move that much inside the case....
<br />
<br />this is really weird it happens after a certain period of gaming time Or usually when i die....
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />it seems maybe to be the way i entered the cart in my nes....
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />by the way : Is the Chr-ram games compatible with the wires i installed?
<br />
<br />like rad racer, metroid, megaman 2, ?
<br />I recall you say no but someone then explain that it may be possible to be done.

<br />Hm... normally, no. But maybe you can check the pinouts of a RAM chip (which you'll have to take from some other cart) and maybe it's not that different from the AT29C? If so, then maybe you could drop the RAM chip ther when playing CHR-RAM games.
<br />
<br />However, the RAM chips need an extra pin that ROM chip's don't use, the write signal, that indicates that data is to be written. ROMs don't use it because they can't be written, of course.
<br />
<br />So, you'd have to pick that signal from the cart's edge and connect it to the chip.
<br />
<br />I haven't compared the pinouts yet, so I can't really tell if it would be possible to use the same cart for ROM and RAM.
<br />
<br />BTW, as far as I know, the chip used for CHR-RAM is the same used for WRAM/SRAM, so you can pick those and use as CHR-RAM without problems.
<br />
<br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thinking about it a bit more, I believe it would be possible to use the same cart for ROM and RAM. You'd have to place your RAM chip on a socket (permanently) and have wires between the RAM chip and the socket attached to it to make the pinouts of the socket compatible with the socket installed on the board.
<br />
<br />Of course, since you'd have to get that extra write signal from the cart's edge, that would have to be permanently connected to you RAM-chip-socket-monster-thing, and when using ROM games that would be just hanging there.
<br />
<br />So, it would not be a very elegant or simple thing to do, but I believe it would be possible.
