		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, I was looking for a donor cart to solder a rom socket so I could test my NROM games... I looked inside a pirate fami cartridge, and since I saw a package-like chip, I opened the cart. It's a pretty board for what I can tell, since there's a 6264LD + PAL16L8ACN (pirated mapper?) plus a 3V Panasonic CR2032 battery (SRAM?!?)... however there was no ROM to be found except for these stupid globtops (three). Interestingly enough there's a circuit line near the center globtop marked &quot;VCR7&quot;... is that what I think it is?<br /><br />So anyway, my question is: is it possible to do something with this cart to accept an EPROM? Is there a way to melt this globtops away?<br /><br />thanks.

That said, although NTSC games usually work on a PAL NES, the music may sound terrible (out of tune).

If you wanted to somehow remove them intact, you'd need to use rather nasty chemicals (e.g. <em>boiling</em> fuming nitric acid).
