After the discussion (with no answer) about &quot;who's the creator of the header&quot;, I though it's better to avoid such term for a single reason: there's no &quot;iNES&quot; header. As you say &quot;iNES&quot;, you are referring to the emulator created by Marat. With all my respect, of course.

And there are other header formats out there, I know the iNES is the most (if not only) used one these days but saying &quot;NES header format&quot; sounds like it is official, something that's present on physical ROM cartridges, or an unique/absolute/ultimate format.

From Marat's page:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><strong>What is iNES?</strong><br /><strong>iNES</strong> is <span style="text-decoration: underline">a program that emulates Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Famicom videogame consoles on your computer.</span> It plays NES games on PCs, PocketPCs, Macs, Unix boxes, etc. The idea to write a NES emulator originated from Alex Krasivsky who found some Famicom programming information on the Net and wrote the initial code. At some point, Alex lost interest in the project, while I eventually rewrote the code, made it closely mimic the quirks of the original hardware, and expanded it to support many different cartridge types and hardware add-ons. At the time of iNES release in 1996, there was only one other NES emulator, Pasofami, written by a Japanese author and really difficult to use. iNES became the first NES emulator usable by a non-expert, and also the first emulator to use <strong>the .NES cartridge file format.</strong></div><br /><br />See what I mean?

It's what people know it by, and thus what it means. If the issue is giving credit, then the appropriate thing to do is put the information out there, perhaps on Wikipedia (with citations), not to try to rename iNES.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I apologize for the language, but seriously, what the fuck ?<br /><br />Two individuals (Zepper + Tepples) randomly decided that all references to &quot;iNES&quot; should be changed into &quot;NES&quot; on both the forum and the wiki, and for no other apparent reason, other than &quot;it creates confusion&quot; and &quot;it sounds like iFad&quot; (of which I have already debated in my previous post).<br /><br />The iNES format has been known, used and named as such for at least 15 years now. Why does two individuals want to change that in just a day ? I makes no fucking sense at all. Well you guys do what you want with your lives, but I'll remain calling it &quot;iNES&quot; and &quot;iNES 2.0&quot;, no matter how you guys like or don't like it. And please don't edit my post to change it  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Those methods are reminiscent to how communism viciously infiltrated eastern Europe in the 40s.<br /><br />EDIT : I just noted how Nestopia calls them &quot;Standard iNES&quot; and &quot;Extended iNES&quot; respectively. I really like this appellation, as it perfectively shows the purpose. The standard iNES itself is just a chain of backward compatibility issues (originally supported 15 mappers, was extended to support up to 255, and yet later extended to support a &quot;PAL only&quot; flag), and then extended iNES came out and tries to fix all the compatibility problems with standard iNES. I really like it, it makes total sense, and I'll stick to this appellation.
