Once the address of the pointer is calculated ($XX + x) and the pointer is used, the target is a single byte. There's no way to access any bytes after that one. If you do wish to access the next bytes, you have to manipulate the pointer itself (INC the lower byte, if it overflows INC the higher byte), which is terribly slow.</div>
<br />But if you do have an array of pointers, such as one pointer for each sound channel, and you only consume a few bytes per frame, 10.02 cycles per increment (INC ptr,x BNE :+ INC ptr+1,x : ) isn't <em>too</em> much slower than 5.02 cycles per increment for (d),y (INY BNE :+ INC ptr+1 : ).
<br />
<br />EDIT: cycle count corrected per tokumaru's clarification

Also, incrementing the pointer is more like <strong>INC prt, x BNE :+ INC prt+1, x :</strong>, because if you knew what pointer to increment there would be no reason to use <strong>(ptr, x)</strong>.

<br />I'm talking about <a href="http://exifpro.com/utils.html" class="postlink">this</a>. It's a 6502 simulator with integrated debug features. You write some code, assemble it (to memory, no files are generated), and then you run it and use a multitude of debugging features to analyze what the program is doing.
<br />
<br />I used it a lot when I was first learning to program in 6502 assembly, to make sure I completely understood how the CPU worked. I wrote all kinds of test code to understand how the carry and the other flags were affected, how the addressing modes worked, subroutines, the stack, everything. Later I practiced by making some useful routines, such as multiplication and division, to make sure I got the hang of it.

<br />That's like killing a fly with a bazooka. As I see it, This is geared towards people researching more obscure behaviors of the 6502, things that haven't been properly documented yet and that until recently required expensive equipment and a real 6502 to test. It is, however, very demanding on computer resources and doesn't offer particularly friendly debugging controls. For a newbie that's just trying to get the hang of how each instruction works, Michal Kowalski's tool is much more appropriate IMO.

<br />
<br />Wow THANK YOU so much tokumaru! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />   I tried this code
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; .org $0000<br />temp .DB 0<br />grate .DB 7&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;.ORG $1000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; LDA #$03<br />&nbsp; STA temp<br />&nbsp; INC temp<br />&nbsp; LDY #101<br />&nbsp; STA &#40;$34&#41;, y<br />&nbsp; INY <br />&nbsp; INY</div>
<br />
<br />But the only thing that seems to work is it puts a 7 in address $0001.
<br />What is the problem with the rest of my code?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Guess I have to read some instructions. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />

Did you put unused sprites off-screen? You must put sprites you are not using below the end of the screen (use a Y coordinate of 240 or more) in order to hide them, otherwise most emulators will put the sprites at the top left of the screen (coordinates 0, 0).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">In <span style="color: red">nintendulator</span> it pops up a small box that says "Bad opcode, CPU locked".

<br />The program is crashing, just like it was before. You have to solve this the same way, tracing the code and finding out where it derails.

<br />Just for the record, this specifically means your program has hit an invalid instruction. It usually happens when your program counter runs through data instead of code.
<br />
<br />This should be a fairly easy one to debug by logging, because it's pretty likely the program halts very soon after the issue, instead of a wild goose chase when it could be anything like before.
