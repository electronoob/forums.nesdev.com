I know it's supposed to be 8 x 8, but when i look at many other sprites there seems to be a lot more pixels involved. I was mainly looking at Megaman and FF1 sprites when i made this. I used the dimensions of Megaman standing sprite which were w20 x h24. Is this a reasonable approach? Would this guy work?</div><br />Yes, it works. The 8x8/8x16 limitation is the size of one HARDWARE sprite, your guy (what Shiru called "a metasprite") can be composed of multiple 8x8 hardware sprites. To cover a 24x24 pixel area at most 9 hardware sprites are needed.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Anyway, here's what i came up with.

<br />I think it looks pretty good. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> In the future you might also want to post a scaled down version of the sprite (maybe about 10-15% of the one you posted) which resembles what players would see on the screen more.

<br />
<br />Yeah, the background would be transparent, so black, white and grey are my 3 colours.
<br />
<br />I think i'm getting the way in which they can be constructed. If he's within the rules, I'll probably develop it a bit, do a little sprite sheet for him to get the feel of things, and then maybe move onto a different style of drawing, try out a few things and see what works the best.
<br />
<br />And thanks thefox, that's a good idea. I'll post up a smaller one alongside him next time
<br />
<br />Thanks again!
<br />
<br />EDIT - thanks for that advice on pixels/colour too 3gengames. Yeah that makes sense. I'll probably go along this route for a bit, and then perhaps making a version with slightly heavier 2px outlines.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Three tips:
<br />
<br />First, when saving pixel art to be posted to a forum, use PNG format instead of JPEG. PNG is designed for pictures with large flat areas. JPEG is designed for gradients, and it can add noise to edges of flat areas.
<br />
<br />Second, when blowing up pixel art to be posted to a forum, resize it to an even multiple multiple of 100%. Preferably resize it by a multiple of ten (e.g. 1000%) or four (e.g. 400%, 800%, or 1600%). You resized your graphic to 1489% or something oddball like that. For <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Overscan" class="postlink">various obscure reasons related to the exact clock speed of the PPU</a>, the most authentic resize is 800% by 700%.
<br />
<br />Third, if you're willing to make your character just a bit smaller, you can stagger the sprite grid to fit odd shapes like the brim of the hat.

<br />
<br />Left: Unoptimized graphic, requiring eight sprites to cover it.
<br />Right: Shrunk just a tad so that I can completely cover it with six sprites.
