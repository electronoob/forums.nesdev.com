<br />
<br />So I don't see why we should have to tolerate the people regularly come here for that - because we don't want to help them doing anything illegal.

<br />It doesn't look like this guy is going to develop an amazing home-brew anytime. Again he's just an example of yet another troll, we have dozen of others.
<br />
<br />He can play it on hardware with the Power Pak if he really wants to.

<br />If you're not 1. writing software and testing compatibility with a mapper, or 2. trying to sell copies, then it might be cheaper in terms of your time just to play these games on a PowerPak. It might sound expensive at first, but time is money too: how much do you make an hour? And it'll let you play any other homebrews and dumped prototypes you come across.
<br />
<br />Or hook a PC up to your TV and play on an emulator. This is even cheaper than a PowerPak, involving one cable ($10 VGA-to-VGA for an HDTV, or $40 VGA-to-composite for an SDTV), and a USB gamepad.

<br />Are you sure that's legal? It seems virtually identical to putting it on EPROM and soldering into a cartridge, from a copyright point-of-view. Besides, it might be more expensive for him, or he might want to make an actual cartridge.
<br />
<br />I have my own objections to helping this guy. His initial posting is poorly organized. Maybe English isn't his native language, but that doesn't change the fact that there is going to be a barrier to understanding. He doesn't seem to be interested in learning more about NES development, so time spent helping him is not a very good investment. Since we have limited time, we should invest it where it gives the most benefit to the community. For example, we might spend the time working on the Wiki.
