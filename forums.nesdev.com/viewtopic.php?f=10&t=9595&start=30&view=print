You'd have to do some tricky offset math to make the cursor appear at the correct spot on the screen. It's such a pain.

How would inheritances multiple levels deep work? For example, in something like:<br /><br />Animal<br />- Mammal<br />-- Dog<br />-- Cat<br />- Bird<br />-- Robin<br />-- Penguin<br /><br />Instead, couldn't one instead include a Mammal object in a Dog object, and an Animal object in a Mammal object?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think I theorized about Solomon's Key using some kind of threads. It probably doesn't use ones with separate stacks, but it clearly has something sophisticated. When there are lots of objects on screen, they sometimes slow down, even though Solomon doesn't. At the very least, it's limiting the number of objects which get to run each frame. I suppose it's not much more than this, because running objects takes roughly constant time per object, and thus the time taken can be estimated accurately by number of objects.<br /><br />As for vtable representations, for single inheritance, there's usually a single pointer in the object that points to the vtable for it. Thus only one vtable is needed per class (rather than per object), and it can be in ROM. Derived classes' vtables can have more entries than base classes'. The base classes don't need dummy entries because you can't call the additional functions with a pointer to the base class (static typing).<br /><br />Sometimes when this machinery is implemented by hand, one just stores the vtable in the object itself, and sets the virtual function pointers in the object's constructor. This has the benefit of allowing per-object replacement of functions, possibly even during the object's lifetime. This allows changing an object's state by just changing a function pointer, e.g. the &quot;run&quot; function from &quot;waiting&quot; to &quot;moving&quot;. This cuts out some branches and can thus be more efficient.<br /><br />Multiple inheritance involves multiple vtable pointers in an object, one for each ultimate base class. Its complexities are one reason some languages don't support it. Let's not even get into virtual base classes... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In my engines, actors only have one function in their class. Each actor has a variable that determines what &quot;kind&quot; of actor it is (a Mario, a fireball, a Goomba, a Koopa, etc), and &quot;kind&quot; is used as an index into a table of pointers which point to jump tables, specific to each possible &quot;kind&quot;. There's another variable, &quot;state&quot;, which is used as an index into the jump table.<br /><br />So, when I tell an actor to runAI(), it first fetches the appropriate jump table depending on the actor's &quot;kind&quot;, and then jumps to the appropriate code from that jump table, depending on the actor's &quot;state&quot;.<br /><br />Every frame, I run a loop that looks at all of the actors, and for each actor who isn't disabled, their code gets run.<br /><br />On an interesting note, in my sprite handling code, &quot;state&quot; is also used as the animation number. I grabbed that idea from Capcom. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
