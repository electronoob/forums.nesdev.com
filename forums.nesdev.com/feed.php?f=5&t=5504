That sounds like a fun project. I think I may attempt it some day. Since my toaster nes still works perfectly though I don't think I'll try it just yet.

I've thought about building a tiny emulator box as well. Not necessarily in an NES case, though. Shouldn't be that expensive. A small amount of ram, a relatively weak processor, TV out, USB ports... Instead of a mechanical HDD or an SSD I'd preferably let it boot off a CF card if that's possible. Cheaper and easily available in smaller sizes while still not too slow.<br /><br />How long would booting a minimal linux system take if you disabled all unnecessary kernel options and skip services and programs you don't need? Not more than a few seconds I'd hope.<br /><br />If not then you might consider using hibernation mode instead of completely shutting down/booting the OS each time. Should be fairly fast since you won't need to have a lot of ram anyway for a minimal OS that isn't really expected to do much multi-tasking and only run a few emulators.<br /><br />Just brainstorming. I've been looking at tiny mainboards and weaker, low-power-consumption CPUs in the past, but I'm still missing a bit of essential information, so I better do some more research first. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1377">miau</a> — Sun Aug 16, 2009 6:06 pm</p><hr />

It would be cool if by then the hardware had been cloned 100% accurately. Either that or someone will have produced a board which is a more powerful modern computer totally dedicated to running an on-board copy of Nestopia or something like that. Seems like it might not be difficult to build a PC which boots linux and just enough software to run a NES emulator or something. Esp. when solid-state hard drives become more prevalent, then it might boot really quickly. Haha, well hopefully this won't be much of a concern since I'll probably be dead before the NES stops working completely. Fun to think about though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Sun Aug 16, 2009 3:38 am</p><hr />

The most sensible part of NES hardware is without a doubt its crappy connector. Then comes the controllers which can be damaged if one doesn't keep much care. Maybe the TV RF modulator would come next. I'm pretty sure the CPU and PPU and other 74 chips are really robust and won't break before say 100 years if you don't do anything bad to them. Electronics were just SO more robusts in the 80s than they are nowdays tiny SMD crap which breaks after 2 years.<br />Also electrolytic capacitors tends to dry out but they can be easily replaced.<br /><br />And yeah that's basically one of the reasons why we have emulators, one day all NESes in the world won't work any longer, and we'd be glad to still play NES games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Aug 15, 2009 11:40 pm</p><hr />

This may seem a silly question, but I've been wondering how long will our toaster NES's last, despite our best efforts to maintain them? How long do microchips in general last?

I thought I had heard several accounts of it being almost as good as the NES itself, and my god were they wrong. It's absolutely terrible (the sound, which is very important to me). Not only was the sound terrible, I had trouble getting the damn thing to boot. My toaster NES has less trouble than that, hardly any since I got the new 72 pin connector.<br /><br />I was thinking that some day if it does stop working, I'll just have to stuff a PC or other computer hardware in the box and stick an nes emulator on it, to preserve the nostalgia =)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Sat Aug 15, 2009 8:02 pm</p><hr />
