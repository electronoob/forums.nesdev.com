But in this case, I must install python to try some scripts for this one program. Non portable is 15 meg, then install. One of the really cool things about NESdev is downloading for less than a second, and getting a totally cool program. <br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Or what alternative to Python should I have been using?</div><br />I like command line apps, but I realize that's certainly not worth the trouble for you if you want to be cross platform. (Indeed, another really cool thing about NESdev is it's pretty cross platform.) Lack of python isn't even something I'd mention if it hadn't been asked about, because I realize how stubborn I am about this sort of thing. I'll probably just write a PyxelEdit to editor program when I need some conversions.<br /><br />Re: Tint bits. Any chance they could make their way to the palette editor? This way one could see their effect on the entire palette without closing it and reopening it to see every change.<br /><br />Re: Copy/Paste. Because the block disappears as you're moving it quickly, sprites around it would be neat. Also, because if I copy a bunch of sky tiles to &quot;blank&quot; an area, when I'm moving around a map that's mostly sky I can't see where I am at all until I end up overlapping something.

If I do make a version that uses bankswitched CHR RAM as work RAM, would you prefer that the screen be turned off during operations using a lot of random access to work RAM, causing flicker? Or would you prefer that such operations be made dog-slow, as in <em>Videomation</em>?

Instead maybe try having 2 displayed bounding boxes, one for source and the other for destination, kind of like in the days before window compositing when a outlined box was showed when moving windows.<br /><br />Moving in the zoomed tile preview is going to be tricky, as I think it should not blink. It might just be acceptable to leave it 3 times as slow (2 frames to load the tiles for each row, and 1 frame to draw them), but if there's enough RAM for a 6x5 tile window (480 bytes) then maybe the tile fetching part can happen in idle frames while the cursor is moving around.
