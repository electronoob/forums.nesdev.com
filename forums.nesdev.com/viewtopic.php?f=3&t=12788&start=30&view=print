To isolate chroma from the rest of the signal, use a bandpass filter centered about the carrier frequency. For NTSC, this might be a bandpass allowing 3.0-4.2 MHz.

I know where it is, and how to get it with &quot;perfect&quot; stuff, like fourier transforms etc. But analog device does work completely different. It can't see future, to perform perfect bandpass. And as you should know bandpass is equal to lowpass+highpass. Also, lowpass is enough to get Y component.<br /><br />I know what is QAM and how to decode it in &quot;perfect&quot; maner again, but it's analog device, it works different. For example no ringing on borders (steps), only glitch transition, but no after-effects except maybe some particular cases.<br /><br />That's why I'm asking about analog lowpass, comming in TV, and how other things made there in most of cases.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The bandpass in analog decoding of NTSC and PAL is made by demodulating first, followed by a sharp lowpass. Even in discrete time versions, because you ultimately need the baseband version of U/V/I/Q, you still usually demodulate first.<br /><br />Simulating analog decoding on a computer is an exercise in frustration—in practice you're going to end up with something that ultimately is discrete-time anyway. Regardless of whether you're working in continuous or discrete time, you can fake an anticausal filter with a delay line—and, in fact, proper PAL decoding requires a delay line anyway.<br /><br />P.S. you need a much sharper filter than just a first-order one.

(frequency is just some random chosen because I don't remember exact value)<br />2) Any analog low-pass filter introduces delay in signal, so does it synced after?

LC contour used for subcarrier restore and can oscillate even from some quick Luma level change. That's this happens with BW contour:<br /><img src="http://savepic.ru/7798317.gif" alt="Image" /><br />[2]<br />I can say more: color U/V decoder adds delay too. That's why in Luma channel there are Luma Delay Line after separating repeater, to eliminate the effect to color decoder input. <br /><img src="http://savepic.ru/7785006.png" alt="Image" /><br />That's right: subcarrier notch filter enabled by color decoder when it detect suitable color signal at input. This was done in order to compatibility to BW television with more frequency in Luma channel (BW contain more details in picture comparing to color).<br /><br />In DSP era video processor delays output signal, so it has some time to predict color and push the limits eliminating some analog color decoder artefacts. It's true even for CRT TVs with DSP (f.e. with PiP or Teletext abilities). DSP can decode color even by one scanline.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">fcism wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Color 0c/1c is greenish cyan on hardwareman's NES,it is wrong ,this color should be azure.</div><br />It can be sort of AVerMedia TV Tuner decoder artefact.

I guess it's just to &quot;understand&quot; to have some imagination.<br />Is it really has two separate LC-circuits?<br />1) one for subcarier separation: high-pass filter or band-pass filter (didn't check what LC-cicruit able to do).<br />2) one for notch filter: low-pass or band-stop filter. <br />That actually mean just opposite to fist one, and easies way to implement it just select other output. It's always in this way: if you connecting in &quot;this way&quot;, you'll get low-pass, and if you connect to same, but in &quot;other way&quot; you'll get hight-pass. But you can connect in both ways at same time, so you'll get two separate signals: low and high pass. Same with band-stop/band-pass.<br /><br />That's why I really doubt, about two separate LC-cicruits. But if they are, then there should be reason to do this exactly in this way.<br /><br />Also, according to this diagram, notch filter does not affect Y (luma) at all. It looks wrong.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">HardWareMan wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">That's right: subcarrier notch filter enabled by color decoder when it detect suitable color signal at input.

More details please. <br /><br />Reason of delay from UV detector is simply phase-response of filters. Yes? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

C25C32L5 ciruit connected right before Luma Delay that marked as DT2. There two electronic switches maked by two transistors marked as VT2 and VT3. They controlled by color decoder and when any of it opens the LC chain connected to the Luma path and can affect to it. There should be 2 different LC contours but USSR engineers cheating with one L and two C for frequency adjust.<br /><br />Notice that there is DT1 64us delay line for color decoding. Feel free for asking any tech info.<br /><br />PS Ah, L5 is SECAM notch. PAL notch situated in A2.1 area, L2C1 circuit. Connected to the &quot;A&quot; point of the luma path.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's easy. <br />1. They bleed as far as LC contour doing damped oscillations. So, you can play with this to find out most authentic visualization.<br />2. Color of bleed is phase of BW luma change respect to chroma burst. As we know that BW luma change aligned to pixels and in PAL case there are 6 scanline shift cycle. So, you can calculate the bleeding HUE to any pixel position. It can be done by measuring or result observing on authentic CRT TV.<br /><br />In fact, those bleeding is artefacts and engineers trying to rid off them. I recall that correct adjustment of the decoder reduces them to a minimum making it imperceptible. In the opposite case, they can be even brighter than the color. Like that rainbow effect in Sonic or Shinobi games on MegaDrive/Genesis.<br /><img src="http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/6063/28117145.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://i1060.photobucket.com/albums/t449/sonik_br/IMG_20130101_223542_zpsaaccae99.jpg" alt="Image" />

I use a sine function for generate UV signals (technically, I generate three signals: R-Y, B-Y and G-Y. G-Y can be restored from R-Y and B-Y, but in this case it same shifted sine) . This what I've got:<br /><img src="http://savepic.ru/7825811.png" alt="Image" /><br />It's rough approach but it's clear that this method is right for PAL (and may be NTSC because they almost the same). Only index of color are used (as color box coordinate) and two luma level used as it in PPU. Discuss.<br /><br />PS Blurred:<br /><img src="http://savepic.ru/7801237.png" alt="Image" />
