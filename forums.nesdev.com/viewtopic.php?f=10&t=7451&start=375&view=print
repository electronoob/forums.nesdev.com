<br />
<br />I defined them interleaved like that (i.e. all the top left tiles first, then all the right left tiles, etc.) because it's easier/faster to access them that way. If they are not interleaved, you can't use the metatile index directly for reading tiles, instead you have to multiply it by 4 (since there are 4 tiles in each metatile). Also, because of that multiplication, you can't have more than 64 metatiles (256 indexes / 4 tiles = 64 metatiles) unless you use Indirect Indexed addressing (LDA ($XX), Y).
<br />
<br />If you can still keep them interleaved in the file you are incbin'ing, great, but you'll have to do something like this to set up the labels to access each of the 4 tiles:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">MetatilesStart:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.incbin &quot;metatiles.bin&quot;<br />MetatilesEnd:<br /><br />MetatileCount = &#40;MetatilesEnd - MetatilesStart&#41; / 4<br /><br />MetatileTile0 = MetatilesStart<br />MetatileTile1 = MetatileTile0 + MetatileCount<br />MetatileTile2 = MetatileTile1 + MetatileCount<br />MetatileTile3 = MetatileTile2 + MetatileCount</div>
<br />And then you can use the 4 labels normally.

<br />After me thinking and praying about what to do, my sister and I chatted about what yall have told us for around 2 hours!  It was a great time; we finally decided to not try to <span style="color: violet">.incbin</span> the nametables because of all of the consequences.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  We also decided to try to not make mistakes during the conversion process; it was that or to accept using a faster-and-slower-more-confused-programming way of thinking about this collision process ("faster" bcause there would be no conversion-of-every-nametable time spent).  But, she wawnts to convert our nametables to the new format that tokumaru mentioned because she had run out of game-work to do due to my lengthly programming stumbling along... way.
<br />
<br />tepples, it was fun to think about doing this Nintendo's way. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />Why would you say each metatile uses 6 bytes?  Each byte in the first metatile is for a 16x16 area, except the MetatilePalette byte that covers a 32x32 area.  Wouldn't each metatile use 5.25 bytes?   edit: <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />, I dont know if 5.25 bytes  would be the correct number... that is what my sister and I came up with; I am trying to figure out how to fill the MetatilePalette parts of our NametableCollision files.

<br />
<br />If you don't want to be restricted to only 64 metatiles, you can do *exactly* like SMB and have the palette bits double as metatile bank selectors. That way you can still have 256 metatiles, but divided in 4 groups of 64, and all the metatiles of the same group use the same palette.
<br />
<br />It's a fairly compact format, and should work well for most games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />An "index" is a number you use to access something. Since metatiles are dfined in the ROM sequentially, you can use numbers to access them. The first one is index 0, the second one is index 2, and so on. So if you are gonna use the metatile indexes to specify palettes, you just have to pay attention to the order in which you define them. Metatiles that use palette 0 must be between 0 and 63, metatiles that use palette 1 must be between 64 ans 127, and so on.
<br />
<br />If you really plan on having only 64 metatiles at a time, you can have your screen array use only one byte for both the metatile index (6 bits) and the palette index (2 bits). That way you just have to mask out the bits you don't need depending on the info you want to use. For example, after calculating the position of the metatile in the screen array:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;;calculate the position of the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;metatile from its coordinates<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda metatileY<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;asl<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;asl<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;asl<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;asl<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ora metatileX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tax</div><br />You can do this to load its index (which you can then use to read tiles or collision information):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;;get the index of the metatile<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda screenArray, x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;and #%00111111 ;remove the palette bits<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tax</div>
<br />Or you can AND the value with %11000000 instead to keep only the palette bits, which you'll need in order to compute the attribute table data.

<br />I'm having a new problem... the attribute bits are bothering me because I must have more than 64 metatiles.  So I thought maybe since the two attribute bits are important I could store 4 pairs of attrilbute bits in a byte... in my head i would need 15 rows of 4 bytes to hold all of it.  So that is close to the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_attribute_tables" class="postlink">8 byte by 8 byte attribute table representation</a> in the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com" class="postlink">nesdev wiki</a>.  Why does the nametable attribute table need 64 bytes?   I think it should have 60 bytes.   But it needs 64... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />

I think it should have 60 bytes.   But it needs 64... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></div>
<br />Yes, there are unused bits in the attribute tables. The reason why the PPU uses 64 bytes rather than 60 is because the attributes are arranged in squares. The bottom half of the last row of squares doesn't have correspondent tiles in the name table, because the name table is only 30 tiles high, so there are indeed a total of 32 bits (4 bytes) that don't do anything, but they are still part of the attribute tables because they share bytes with bits that ARE used.
<br />
<br />I'm not gonna lie to you, attributes can be pretty hard to manage. Having to shift and combine bits to for the attribute bytes is not something you can easily do without some good amount of planning. So take your time, draw it all on paper and think hard about it, eventually you'll find a solution that works for you.
<br />
<br />As I said before, quite a few NES games used 32x32-pixel metatiles, because that's the exact size of the area affected by an attribute byte. This means that the program can easily write the attribute bytes straight to the attribute table, without any sort of processing. I'm not saying this is the best solution for all cases, but if you're really having a hard time with attributes, this is the easiest solution there is.
