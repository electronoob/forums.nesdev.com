<div class="quotetitle">UncleSporky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />This way you do not have to touch $2000, and the second write to $2006 copies T to V, implementing that new scroll.<br /></div><br />Please don't think of setting the scroll with $2005/$2006 as a "shortcut". You may "not have to touch $2000", but it's still slower and more complex than using $2000 and $2005, which is the correct, safe way of setting the scroll.<br /><br />The correct way to set the scroll is selecting the desired name table by writing to $2000 and then specifying how far into that name table rendering should start with 2 consecutive writes to $2005, all of this still during VBlank. This is the correct and safe way to do it if you are a nice boy and like to play by the rules.<br /><br />But if you like adventures, and for whatever reason you absolutely <strong>need</strong> to set the scroll outside of VBlank, you have to use those tricks.<br /><br />The PPU has this internal register it uses to read and write information in it's address space. We control this register by writing to $2006. Curiously enough, the PPU appears to use this same register to keep track of what's displayed during rendering. The conclusion is that, as long as we obey the format in which the PPU handles that information, we can alter what is fetched for display as the screen renders.<br /><br />That's it. Obey the format the PPU uses, and use whatever combination of writes to put the information where you want it. Do this at the correct time during rendering and you'll successfully manipulate the scroll mid-frame.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Jul 31, 2009 5:19 am</p><hr />

Look at Blargg's doc. The value in V, along with the 3 bits in F, make the current scroll position. This is what V must hold in the end: 0yyyVHYY YYYXXXXX<br /><br />You just have to use whatever combination of writes to put the coordinates you want in that format. This is why loopy's and Blargg's documents are important, they tell where each written bit ends up. If the first write to $2006 didn't clear the top 2 bits it would be much easier, but since it does a more complex approach is necessary. Personally, I write in the following order:<br /><br />1. ----VH-- to $2006;<br />2. Y scroll to $2005;<br />3. X scroll to $2005;<br />4. YYYXXXXX to $2006;<br /><br />Once V is fully formed, it doesn't necessarily become 0, 0. That V will be used from the point it was set onwards. That is, if you write $00 to $2006 twice by the middle of the screen, you'll see the top of the first name table at the bottom half of the screen.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Jul 31, 2009 5:01 am</p><hr />

I was just about to try to respond to that. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />No need to use $2000 if you are using $2006 to set the scroll (which you should only if setting the scroll outside of VBlank).<br /></div><br /><br />How do you use $2006 to set the scroll?<br /><br />EDIT: I had a guess above that was incorrect.  Let me try again.  As Disch showed us in the other topic, you use $2006 and $2005 together to assemble the full T register according to the scroll you want.  In this case $2006 is not being used for an address, but merely as a way to write the nametable bits into the 16-bit register (since $2005 alone can't do that).  This way you do not have to touch $2000, and the second write to $2006 copies T to V, implementing that new scroll.<br /><br />One other problem with Blargg's doc is that we have the useful information of what $2005 does (sets X/Y scroll) and un-useful information for $2006 (sets the high bits of T?).  When written that way I immediately think of "sets" in terms of setting a flag, or set carry, meaning it writes 1s.  But from other documents I see you're usually entering in an address to access with $2007.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3438">UncleSporky</a> — Fri Jul 31, 2009 4:35 am</p><hr />

As loopy explained it the PPU has a few different address registers of sorts. The names I remember would be Loopy_T, Loopy_V and FineX. When you write to $2005 or $2006 it changes a piece of Loopy_T, which is not where the Loopy_V points to, and Loopy_V is where the PPU is pointing to currently. Only on a second write to $2006 I believe, is Loopy_T put into Loopy_V. You also need to understand there is a flip-flop bit that determines a 1st or 2nd write to $2005 and $2006 to determine High or Low write, and that it is shared between them. That means if you write to $2005 and then $2006 that will change Loopy_V. <br /><br />Another thing is that you need to set the scroll values every frame. So during your NMI you should read $2002 to reset the flip-flop and then do your VRAM updates, and finally set your scroll position so that when the PPU begins rendering it begins from the proper place. You shouldn't set it once and assume it will stay like that. I suppose it might stay like that if you do not make any writes to $2005 or $2006 so that the Loopy_T never changes as if it does Loopy_T will be copied to Loopy_V at the beginning of the frame causing a scroll you didn't expect. <br /><br />Hopefully that all makes sense, if not read loopy's document on NES scrolling magic. It's not that hard to understand and it explains everything you need to know.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Thu Jul 30, 2009 1:33 pm</p><hr />

(This is from NES101.)<br /><br />But I agree with you on the rest, I thought I was all set.  Clear $2006 twice, set the H and V scroll when you need to and you're fine.  Apparently not!<br /><br />Although upon rereading the part you quoted, it does make sense to me: think of 2006/2007 as a normal register like "a."  Once it is done being used, the leftover data is still inside, so I need to set it again.  At least I think so...but then again I'm still not accessing $2005 at all.  What else could be messing with the scroll values?  Hmm.<br /><br />Anyway I will experiment with it and see if I can stop the bouncing.  I would like to know more certainly if this problem only cropped up because I am out of time and need to start optimizing, though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3438">UncleSporky</a> — Thu Jul 30, 2009 10:25 am</p><hr />

What never made any sense to me is why people say things like this:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The VRAM read/write port (PPUADDR/PPUDATA, $2006/$2007) uses the same register inside the PPU as the scroll position (PPUSCROLL, $2005). So yes, after you upload new data to the PPU, you need to reset the scroll position.<br /></div><br /><br />Not to sound crass, but this is the equivalent of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWWbPb7-ZnQ" class="postlink">this video</a> -- "Give him the stick... DON'T GIVE HIM THE STICK!"  Meaning: the statement has never made any sense to me... but then again, I've never understood loopy's document.  That is to say, I understand the concept of the PPU itself having its own addressing bits which $2005/6/7 controls in unique ways, but I don't understand *how*.<br /><br />More specifically, when someone says "you need to reset the scroll position", my answer is: to what?  How do you know what the scroll position *should* be?<br /><br />I've seen code where people do what UncleSporky does -- set $2005 to $00 twice.  I've seen this in FF2j (for sake of example too).  But I also remember being told to do stuff like "set $2006 to $23C0 before the end of what you're doing" (supposedly setting the internal PPU address to that of the attribute table), and my first response was "why?" yet no explanation given would make any sense.<br /><br />Sorry if I sound like I'm ranting or pissing on people's efforts/explanations -- it's just that the one-line answers really don't explain anything, especially when they're made to be simple like "reset the scroll position" (again: to what, and how do you keep track of it?)<br /><br />EDIT: Okay, <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=5455" class="postlink">this post</a> helps shed some light on things, but it's also a good example of folks (including myself) not understanding the Why, When, and How of this beast.  It's a recurring topic.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Thu Jul 30, 2009 9:47 am</p><hr />
