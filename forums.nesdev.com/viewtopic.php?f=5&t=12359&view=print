XP is badly outdated, not even being able to use all the RAM and other resources we have available today. It is a 14 year old OS afterall.<br /><br />I wish I had the balls to switch to Linux, but my experiences with it so far have been pretty frustrating. I can't install new drivers even if my life depends on it, and when I do get everything working, the OS will randomly break and become unusable after updates.

I don't know in the long run though. Someone (I don't know how trustable he is) told me Gentoo has the best update system, as it does not uninstall anything and cause trouble like other update system does.

There's a lot more I tweak than just this, sadly, and I really need to keep a list of it because the list is quite long compared to what I tweaked on XP (or maybe on XP it's just second-nature to me by now).<br /><br />The only one in your list I hadn't gotten to was disabling gadgets, which AFAIK Microsoft decommed anyway citing security concerns.  I'll have to do that.<br /><br />I had to resort to using Aero.  All my testing (weeks/month) on a VM showed that Classic or Basic worked fine, but on actual hardware etc. it appears that Classic/Basic has a problem with &quot;excessively refreshing/redrawing&quot; portions of an application window when something in that particular object/text changes.  You can actually see it flicker.  In Aero, with the same app: doesn't happen.  *sigh*<br /><br />The disable ClearType + font smoothing (which are separate things) settings I do too, but I spent almost 5 hours yesterday fiddling with web browsers and trying to get shit to render/look like it used to on XP (i.e. GDI).  I found way too many <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8612266/why-cant-directx-directwrite-direct2d-text-rendering-be-as-sharp-as-gdi" class="postlink">Stackoverflow</a> + Reddit posts talking about this exact problem, and nobody has a good solution other than &quot;turn on ClearType&quot; (I'm not doing it, period.  I HATE text looking blurry).  And the thing is, the behaviour varies per browser.  I use Firefox (or Pale Moon) for personal stuff, and Chrome for work, so those are the only two I cared about.<br /><br />The biggest problem I have is with downloadable fonts.  Sites like Google+ are a great example -- they use a font called &quot;Roboto&quot; which is apparently designed around ClearType or subpixel whatever, so when you don't use that <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=137692" class="postlink">it looks like complete dogshit</a> (see picture on left).  That's how a lot of downloadable fonts look in Firefox too.  So this is what I managed to use as a workaround for both browsers, when ClearType is off + font smoothing is off:<br /><br />Chrome 40 -- chrome&#058;//flags then disable DirectWrite (note that the toggle is called &quot;Disable DirectWrite&quot;, so to disable it you actually have to set the setting to &quot;Enabled&quot;)<br />Firefox 35 -- about&#058;config then set gfx.downloadable_fonts.enabled=false<br /><br />The result in Chrome is good -- downloadable fonts look like they did on XP (which to me was tolerable).  The result in Firefox is also good, but the downside is this: there are tons of sites that use downloadable fonts with special Unicode glyphs within those fonts (usually for stupid things like little arrows, emojis, or whatever else -- Wordpress.com's editor is a great example), so by turning off downloadable fonts, on Windows 7 those now just appear as a box.<br /><br />To be honest going to 7 is pretty awful.  I feel like I've taken a serious step backwards in usability in a lot of ways.  There are other things I do like, like how disk I/O is insanely fast compared to XP (even with an SSD + AHCI on XP), and the taskbar improvements are nice (I'm used to those from my old job), but there are a lot of other things that make me cringe and I'm just going to have to force myself to adapt.<br /><br />Oh, the one last thing I'm fearing having to deal with because I don't know what the hell Microsoft did with it: figuring out what exactly happened to &quot;My Documents&quot;.  On XP, you had a &quot;My Documents&quot; folder which defaulted to <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">C:\Documents and Settings\accountname\My Documents</tt>.  If your desktop was set to show that folder, you could right-click on it and <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310147" class="postlink">change internally where that pointed</a>.  And I always did -- I reassigned it to <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">D:\Important Documents</tt> because my C: drive is &quot;sacrificial&quot;, meaning an OS reinstall (format, etc.) would lose all data on C:.  So pointing it to a folder on D: makes a lot of sense.<br /><br />On Windows 7 I have no fucking idea what they did to all of this.  Now I'm left with a folder called accountname on my desktop, which apparently is some kind of &quot;Library&quot;.  I have no clue what that is, how to manage it, etc..  The reason this concerns me is that I have games that have save files, important documents (taxes, PDFs, bills/debts, etc.) that I store in a centralised place (see above), and now I have not the slightest idea how I'm going to centralise all of that onto my D: drive.  Why Microsoft changed this is beyond me.  I see absolutely nothing good from it.<br /><br />Edit: Oh, and because I use small desktop icons, I had to use this registry tweak to make the shortcut &quot;icon/overlay&quot; arrow much smaller (like on XP), because otherwise the shortcut arrow ends up covering practically 1/4th of the icon:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br /><br />&#91;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Icons&#93;<br />&quot;29&quot;=&quot;%SystemRoot%\\System32\\SHELL32.dll,29&quot;<br /></div><br /><br />Microsoft!!! *shakes fist*
