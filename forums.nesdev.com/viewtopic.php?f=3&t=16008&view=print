Or you could add 4 more bits to the spec and wait for somebody to make the 1GB ROM that breaks it. :S

The only few Nintendo-made game that combines EPROMs combines two of the same size. On the SNES it was done frequently.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Action 52 used 3 PRG ROMs. That's the only one I know of but there might be others. That's actually why I said 9 useful values instead of just 8.<br /><br />Though, even that one is fine with theoretical power of 2 multiplier scheme I just proposed as a whim. The multiplier would just change the smallest representable multi-ROM unit from 16k to some other power of 2 size... you could still specify e.g. 113 * 1MB ROMs, for example, if that somehow wasn't insane. What's the downside? Overdumps if some very strange multi-ROM combination ever comes up? Is that even a real problem? We already have to do that for one <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=1808" class="postlink">8k Famicom ROM</a>. Any non-power-of-2 ROM size is going to be a custom mapper anyway to specify what happens to the &quot;missing&quot; address space (duplicate? open bus? used to control something else? ignored?), what does it matter if the ROM has slightly more data than necessary in it...? It'll just be zero fill that compresses to nothing anyway.<br /><br />Anyhow, I'm not really proposing to change iNES 2, I'm just pointing out that it's already &quot;not good enough&quot; for one real homebrew, for basically the same reason OP started this thread. (How many existing ROMs are relying on the extended PRG size bits at this point anyway? Is it not too late to change? Would anyone want to?)

Bytes 14 and 15 are still undefined. If Byte 14's 8 bits were defined to be bits 13-20 of the PRG size field, then NES 2.0 would be able to specify 16 <em>gigabytes</em> of PRG. If we wanted to split byte 14 between PRG and CHR, then growing PRG's size field from 12 to 16 bits would still specify up to gigabyte of PRG.
