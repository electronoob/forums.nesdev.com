I haven't priced shirts in a while so I'll have to double check, but I remember the prices being around $2 for a cheap shirt up to around $5 for a nice t-shirt like an American Apparel. Maybe another dollar or so for consumables. The setup of burning a screen for each color is the biggest consumable expense for what I'm assuming is going to be a pretty small print run.<br /><br />I don't know about anybody else, but I'd rather go for the more expensive shirt. Especially since I'm not aiming to do this for profit.<br /><br />It's a hobby I haven't done for a while, but I think I'm pretty decent at it. Here's an example of a shirt I designed and printed:<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<br />
	</div><br /><br />That one consists of two separate color discharge underbases, one being blue (underbase for metal) and one being light brown. (underbase for wood, difficult to see in photo) There are also two halftone layers printed in water-based ink for the details of the image. I like to work almost exclusively with discharge and water-based inks, because I'm not a fan of plastisol or the way it feels.<br /><br />My press is limited to 4 colors, but I think there's a lot one can do with 4 colors if they're creative.<br /><br />If there are people who might be interested in buying a shirt rather than getting one as a reward for contribution, maybe it would be worth considering printing extras, and putting the profits toward rewards. I'd be happy with that if all of the proceeds go to the compilation.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Great ideas so far guys.  I will agree that changing it to a &quot;game jam&quot; doesn't really fit.  I think that two categories would be good. NROM and Anything Goes.<br /><br />There had been previous talk of a theme, which is more of a game jam type of format.  I think for game jams, it helps to have a theme since you have to JAM as much content into such a short period of time that you don't have time to keep changing your mind on what you are going to do.  Honestly I think this fits pretty well with the NESDev compo.  As others have said, spending your spare time working on a project for 7 months there is plenty of time to procrastinate.  Keeping a goal in mind I think would be useful.<br /><br />I'd be glad to help again with the organizing, voting and such. I plan on totally revamping the <a href="http://nesdevcompo.nintendoage.com" class="postlink">website</a>.  Hosted on Nintendoage... lets keep it clean people  <img src="./images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" />

This would combat the time constraint above.

I agree with better quality shirts too, sounds like in all $10 will cover everything then?  That seems like a good price to me.

Others will probably find a half-way contest to be helpful though, so I say aim high and do whatever you think will work.<br /><br />Bounties offered by non-organizers would be an interesting way to handle this. People would put up their own money for games/programs they'd like to see made, and then when the contest is over they would get to decide the winner of their prize.</div><br /><br />My idea of a half-way point wouldn't have to include submission of a WIP rom.  A progress thread that's showing general progress of the game would satisfy my thought.  The half-way point 'check-up' had two intents. Firstly to prevent issues like we have had previously were we can't accept submissions due to copyright or other reasons.  This would allow feedback to the developer early enough to allow them to modify their game.  Secondly that was when I had planned to distribute something along the lines of a 'hardware dev kit'.  So it could be made use of during this year's compo.  Doesn't sound like such a kit is of interest here which might make be due to none of us are new-comers.  <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I like this idea in general; however, I don't know if New Year's day would be the best option, due to parties and/or possible hangovers. :p<br />The 7-8 months deadline sounds reasonable enough.</div> Yeah new year's day probably isn't the best choice.  The months of Dec/Nov didn't sound good either as people are usually busy with holidays, travel, and/or end of semester obligations.  Sometime mid-late January would be good.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It says 8k and 64k enteries, with a list of compatible mappers, but it's not clear to me how CHR-ROM is handled....</div>All CHR-ROM games are converted to CHR-RAM in the creation of the multigame. Contestants still submit standard NROM .nes files, Tepples has handled the conversion for everyone in the past.<br /><br />I would like to keep the standard submission category a limit of 64KB like we did last time.  The final hardware has CHR-RAM so no good reason to artificially limit developer's use of it's benefits by requiring all submissions to be NROM.  We can have the limit of 64KB with all possible mappers, but recommend/suggest NROM as it's the popular choice.
