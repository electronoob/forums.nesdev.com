Not really beneficial over using RAM though.<br /><br />But yeah, I think it's very important to be aware of all sorts of concurrency issues that can arise even in the seemingly simple scenario of two threads (with a special case where only one of them (vblank) can interrupt the other) on a uniprocessor system.

But if you're using a scanline counter, I'm not sure why you'd need to turn off nmi? Nevermind, I don't know enough details about what you're doing. Still, I don't think one should ever need to turn off nmi. graphics, yes, nmi, no. You can just make your nmi a no-op if you need to. (swap out an indirectly called routine?)<br /><br />...I forgot one more point about making music bankswitching interrupt-safe, and that's if you do ever have moments in your game that cause slowdown---it protects your game from crashing when the sound update continues to run at normal speed every frame. Not that it absolves one from having slowdowns---it's just good to try to make code bullet proof if possible.

After the player chooses a game from the multicart's menu, it blanks the screen and silences the APU before decompressing 8192 bytes of CHR data.

But bankable data cannot be tracked by the same way at build. Perhaps Lua scripting of the recent NintendulatorDX would be able to at least verify that the correct bank was being accessed and alert you if banking code was needed, though unless every code path was taken it wouldn't be able to prove that banking wasn't needed at a given point in code.
