My projections could be wrong on this, but it's a pretty safe bet volume 3 and beyond will earn us more than volume 1-2.<br /><br />volume1 was limited in it's earning potential due to the fact it was limited to 150 loose cart copies alone.<br /><br />I believe volume 2 was limited in earnings because we opted to exclude a limited edition version making the clear copies available to contributors alone.  That paired with the high cost of printed materials that was just barely recouped.  On top of this it took a couple years from compo to publishing as we didn't have enough entries from the 2nd compo to fill the cart.  This overly long delay didn't help sales IMO.  Sales for volume 2 seemed rather low IMO, but I'm not too surprised all things considered.  <br /><br />Volume 3 is larger than both previous versions, and we'll be having 100 limited edition clear cartridges being sold to help offset the cost of printed materials.  I expect we'll recoup printed material costs within an hour of release compared to ~1year after the fact with volume 2.<br /><br />Volume 4 is on track to be 1MByte in size again, and the level of polish and depth of the games from the recent compo is much greater than we've ever seen IMO.  We're finally getting into the annual rhythm we were after from the start and I'm expecting we will be able to publish this year's entries before year's end.<br /><br />One idea I did have based on the assumption that volume 3 will easily outsell volume 2 would be to offer a discount for purchase of volume 2+3 bundled together.  But I'm also not sure if this may conflict with intentions of releasing a compilation cartridge of all volume's titles now that we've hit the 53 mark.  I may create a poll thread to gauge thoughts on this idea.  I think it's safe to say people will be coming to buy volume 3 who don't own volume 2, and a bundled discount might be appreciated.  Something like offering the CIB at loose cart pricing might be nice as we have a much more volume 2 boxes than we'll likely ever use.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Wed Mar 21, 2018 12:41 pm</p><hr />

First off, I've sent out an email to cash prize placing entrants requesting payment info, so prize money will be going out soon.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">NESHomebrew wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle">infiniteneslives wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What carries the weight is what the community wants to spend compo funds on.<br /></div></div><br /><br />On this topic, I think a donation to NA/NESDev to help with hosting was discussed at one time.  Should we poll that, or is it a no-brainer?</div><br />From what I recall NA has an annual fund raiser for hosting fees, anyone know when that is?  I've reached out to whoaman in the past, but it's worth doing again.  <br /><br />I'll put together another financial report ~month after action53 volume3 release.  Not much has changed in earnings since the <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=14015#p196999" class="postlink">last report</a> where we had ~$2k, only a few volume 2 cartridge sales since.  We spent a close to $1k on printed materials for upcoming volume 3 release, and we're dropping ~$1k for cash prizes now.  I purchased the sega/famicom bitboxes as well, but I won't count that as an upfront cost, I'll just bill it into the per cartridge earnings like I do with all other cart costs.  So effectively at the moment we're probably pretty close to zero balance.<br /><br />Moving forward I'm sure volume 3-4 and subsequent carts will bring in significantly more funds than volumes 1 &amp; 2 did.  To date vol 1&amp;2 have funded the upfront publishing costs of vol 3, and prize cost of vol 4 which is pretty impressive IMO.  We don't have a lot of spare funds at the moment, but that's due to the double whammy of not getting past volume released prior to next compo ending which falls on my delays in publishing.  Not a big deal, that all will soon change with volume 3 release.  I'm also going to be pushing harder to get vol 4 released prior to this holiday season.<br /><br />So once I put out the post vol3 release financial report we can evaluate diverting some of those funds to hosting fees and such.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Also, could someone with forum superpowers make a 2018 compo category.

I guess part of it is, personally I'm not really looking for more ways to earn funds as the action53 cartridges earn plenty of money to fund the compo.  If a project of that (or any) nature were in need of funding and the community wanted to divert action53 funds towards a separate project I'm perfectly fine with that.

If we were to do an auction like this I would prefer the auction proceeds go to charity.  The compo funds could cover the material costs and then donate the items being auctioned so 100% of earnings would be going towards the charity.

It will be a several months before the majority of it's user base will be able to touch NESmaker.  I wouldn't recommend anyone looking to learn 6502 assembly to pay for tutorials with all the high quality free resources already out there.  Part of that is based on my feeling that it's more important to be motivated to learn assembly by actually doing it, than having a top notch tutorial.  There's a significant difference between being motivated enough to pay something on the order of $50 to learn assembly, and being motivated enough to invest the time needed to learn it.  There are lots of skills I would happily drop a couple grand to know like Spanish &amp; Japanese, but none of that matters if I don't want devote the time to learning it.  But if someone were to make a top notch tutorial which people valued it enough to pay for it, then more power to them.  For something of this nature it probably makes more sense for the tutorial to prove it's value and effectiveness prior to investing in publication of it (especially when digital publication is near free). <br /><br />NESmaker related projects aside, I'm always open to putting the compo funds to financing of projects which the community believes to be a worthwhile expense of the funds.  In the end I don't feel my personal opinion carries much weight on it's own.  What carries the weight is what the community wants to spend compo funds on.  If there were a specific project in mind a way of getting this approval would probably be to list poll threads on nesdev &amp; NA with the proposal specifics.  I used this method in determining if we would be publishing action53 vol3 CIBs with traditional cardboard boxes, or bitboxes and it seemed to work out well.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Tue Mar 20, 2018 12:40 pm</p><hr />

I understand completely. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />So it needs to be clear that this is an arrangement between you (the developer volunteering time) and them (game development manager?).<br /></div><br />Oh yeah, definitely.

I could give him some donation alternatives (nesdev, na, shirus' charity) instead like you suggested.<br /><br /><br />As for other ideas, someone on that new nesmakers board mused that people would likely be willing to pay for an asm6 tutorial. Personally i wouldn't feel comfortable taking personal gain for anything like a plain tutorial when the knowledge is out there for free if you know where to look. Also almost everything i've learned is thanks to the efforts freeware culture. I do recognize that freeware has its limits at the same time - it requires a special effort and skillset seeking everything out as it is fractured and spread out, which is kind of out of scope for many nesmaker users or else they'd be using asm6/nesasm/ca65 already. So there might be a space for curated knowledge. Maybe a proper e-magazine (pdf, some 32 pages or something per issue) with illustrative figures and articles written with newcomers in mind would be a good way to help them. Maybe charge a suitable (ie low) fee per issue for the benefit of the community. I don't even know if it is feasible, but morals first: yay or boo?

The only financial support of the compo I can recommend is for them to purchase an action53 cartridge.  There isn't a dedicated paypal account for the compo, I'm not sure I feel comfortable with someone donating cash.  Additionally, nesdev isn't it's own financial/legal entity so I effectively have to maintain the funds as a portion of own my business.  It then starts to look like people are donating money to my business which isn't something I want to support nor give the idea that I encourage it.<br /><br />I'm not sure there's still a means of doing so, but I would rather recommend donations be made to web hosting costs of nesdev or NintendoAge.  Additionally there are a number of legitimate charities that could better use donations than the compo, there's a few out there which are gaming related as well and help children in need.<br /><br />Above all else I don't want to give any reason for people to think there's a suggested/required donation to compete.  So it needs to be clear that this is an arrangement between you (the developer volunteering time) and them (game development manager?).  Trying to prevent it from looking like an arrangement between them and the compo is part of my resistance towards accepting donations.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Mon Mar 19, 2018 1:59 pm</p><hr />

Honestly, just happy that the competition let us get exposure along with so many other great titles. It's good company to be in, for sure.<br /><br />I'm super excited about what more Wolfling has to offer, and have added LightShields to my regular multiplayer rotation.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5942">M_Tee</a> — Fri Mar 16, 2018 10:49 am</p><hr />
