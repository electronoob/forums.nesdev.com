But time might be a tad easier to come by than ROM, unless you can (say) combine two 64K entries into one 128K ROM that only actually uses 96K, or unless you think you can flesh it out for a solo cart release (like <em>Twin Dragons</em> from last year).

The map is pretty huge.</div><br />I think that the FOV is fine, it's the vertical scaling that's off. Walls are too tall when you're far away and too short when you're close. Even if you touch your node against a wall, its entire height matches that of the viewport. You shouldn't be able to see the entire wall if you got your nose up against it. Anyway, the disparity between vertical and horizontal scaling is what's distorting things... The horizontal scaling is correct because the rays are spreading properly and hitting the correct blocks, but passages look narrow from afar because the walls are way too tall. How are you calculating the height of the walls? What I do is divide a constant by the distance from the player to the wall. I try to calculate the value of the constant so that blocks look square when faced straight on, but I end up tweaking it a bit until it looks right to me. There's quite a bit of leeway due to the low horizontal resolution and the console's PAR.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">lol @ the description of my art <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> With the 3d view taking most of the available tiles, it couldn't be that detailed, and I liked the way it got.

And it clashes badly against the beautiful art found in the rest of the game. It looks like you have what, around 34 tiles for that GUI? That should be enough for a nice stonework pattern and some decorated borders for the text boxes and the like. That would also fit the game's ambiance much better. The map could maybe be drawn in sepia tones instead and be framed like a traditional fold up map. Just some ideas.

Just turning to look around takes 8 seconds.<br /><br />The enemies have WAY more HP than you have attack power. When I found the exit, I had an attack power of 5. I was fighting enemies with over 100 HP. That is a slow, slow, slow battle. It was ok at 800% speed. Maybe I was supposed to level up more? Or find some special weapon?<br /><br />I had no idea where I was. Maybe you could use color to differentiate different areas of the map. Like, start area is green, another area is red, or gray, or darker green.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, 5 attack power is low... you need to look for more chests and use better weapons and cast some spells. If you encounter enemies that are too strong (even if they technically can be defeated), it's better to run and try to find some gear that will boost your attacks, defense and magic. But i'm also going to admit that the time we had for balancing was cut short.

Press it at the right moment when attacking or when being attacked in order to do critical damage or block. It takes a little practice to get it right somewhat reliably. I wanted to text this one way or the other in-game (maybe by enemies showing it is possible by them blocking and criting, maybe with a gauge, maybe with a plain instructional text) or else describe it in a manual, but as it stands, i can see it is currently unintuitive.
