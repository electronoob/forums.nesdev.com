		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here's a rather unusual question that occupies my mind lately... what negative health effects might there be from consuming alcohol mixed with ROM chips in it?
<br />
<br />The background is I've lately been dressing up as a pirate at masquerades. And as we all know, a pirate's favorite drink consists of rum... which is actually spelt "rom" in Swedish. I guess you can all see the extremely geeky pun by now <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />And while having a "bottle o' ROM" filled with NES ROM chips and some worn-out EPROMs is geeky enough, it's not very drinkable and leaves me with having to keep a bottle of actual rum as well. 
<br />
<br />So I am considering going against all "never mix, never worry" warnings and mixing my drinkable rum with the ROM/EPROM chips in one unified bottle... but am worried that the health effects might be worse than a damaged liver.
<br />
<br />Anyone got any thoughts on this?

<br />The materials used to change the conductive properties of the silicon in IC's are poisonous, arsenic is one of them. Also non ROHS compliant ones will contain lead.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Definitely don't do anything like that. Even putting the chips in liquid and then drinking just the liquid is a bad idea. While it won't necessarily make you drop dead right away they are unlikely to be harmless. Particularly if you haven't cleaned the objects first. Given there age and where they have been who knows what trace amounts of bad things are on them. And alcohol might actually be worse than water alone to be drinking after putting old dirty ICs in it.

IDK if such a thing exists, but maybe somebody does. You could make a pretty cool bottle with the chips glued (in whatever way) to the sides of the bottle in random orientations. You know, similar to how they put <a href="http://indianmirrormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/SNAKE-AND-DRINK-copy-182x300.jpg" class="postlink">snakes and stuff</a> in booze bottles in some countries.

<br />
<br />Jokes aside, it sounds like those chips are just as poisonous as I feared... I keep wishing there was some easy way to de-toxify them though... thefox's idea sounds decent, but I also wouldn't know of any obvious material that would be thin enough for coating the chips nicely, without being damaging to your health by itself.
