		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi,
<br />
<br />I have a little question about the quantities of graphics we can use in our game: 
<br />
<br />In every source code I studied, there is always only 1 sprite sheet for the foreground and 1 sprite sheet for the background.
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.bank 2<br />.org $0000<br />.incbin &quot;foreground.chr&quot;<br />.incbin &quot;background.chr&quot;</div>
<br />
<br />The sheets have to be 128x128 right? So, beeing newbie, the question that pop in my head is : How did they fit all needed sprites for Final Fantasy in only one 128x128 sprites sheet?? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />
<br />
<br />I didn't study much about memory mappers yet but, is that how ?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle">Edgyr wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The sheets have to be 128x128 right?</div><br />The dimensions don't really matter, as long as there is a total of 256 8x8 tiles.<br /><br />It's true, the NES can only "see" 256 tiles for sprites and 256 tiles for the background at a time. However, carts can contain much more than that, they just have to "show" different parts of it to the NES at different moments.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I didn't study much about memory mappers yet but, is that how ?</div>
<br />Yes. Mapping memory means making a certain piece of memory visible/accessible at a certain address range. This means that although the NES only has a small memory range defined for graphics, memory mappers can make small sections of a much larger block of data visible at that range.
<br />
<br />It works somewhat like a book. You can only see two pages at a time, but the book can have hundreds of them. You can see everything by flipping the pages (bankswitching), but at any given moment you can only see 2 of them.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Forgot to mention that there is another way to have more graphics than that, which is by using CHR-RAM instead of CHR-ROM. That basically means that the cart does not contain a chip for graphics and a chip for code, it has a RAM chip in place of the graphics one. This means that the graphics can be changed by the program as it runs, allowing for more than 256 + 256 tiles.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Final Fantasy games uses CHR-RAM, so the programm can rewrite the tiles at any time. It's still limited to 512 tiles by screen, but the sprites graphics can be changed from a place to another, and of course they are changed when entering into battle.
<br />
<br />Final Fantasy 2&amp;3 went one step further and changes the sprite graphics loaded on the fly during the battle. This is possible but the amount of tiles that can be rewritten for each frames is greatly limited by VBlank time.
