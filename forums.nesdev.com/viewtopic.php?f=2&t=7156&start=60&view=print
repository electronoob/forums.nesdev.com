<br />What about if I already had data made that way before I even planned to have it compressed ?
<br />Otherwise you're right, you'd want it in plain text with marker for end of every message/map that the compressor should use to make a "break".
<br />
<br />It's this "break" ability, necessary for any practical use, that all compressing tools so far lacks badly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Someone could probably to huffman on paper.  Maybe a savant could do it in his or her head.  Just saying...
<br />
<br />But seriously, do and experiment.  Create a simple, custom file format and write a compression tool in your favorite qucik+dirty language.  I like C/C++ and perl.  Tepples like Python.  One of my coworkers writes simulation software in BASH (slower than sh*t though).
<br />
<br />Do you store your (raw) strings in Pascal format (first byte = strlen), or in C format (terminates on NULL)?
<br />
<br />Have your tool compute how many bytes would be consumed by the raw text + lsm/msb pointers.  Have it compute the byte size of the output and compare to get a "percent space saved".
<br />
<br />Then figure out how many bytes are taken up by the decompresser in 6502.
<br />
<br />This could make for an interesting competition...
<br />
<br />Bregalad, I don't need text compression at this time. However, if you come up with something easy to invoke from a Linux tool build chain (ie, works well with Make and runs on the Linux CLI), then I would be happy to consider it when the time comes for me to use compressed text.
<br />
<br />However, I think that if you were making a tool for the "community" then you should consider that some people develop on Macs, some on Linux/bsd/solaris and some on Winblows.  "EXEs" are probably not the best bet.  Perl and Python are portable (enough) and writing parsers in them is sooo much easier than in C/C++.  Java seems like overkill to me.  I don't even have a jre/jdk on my dev box, and hope to avoid needing it.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Another consideration for NES text compression is decompression speed and code size.
<br />
<br />Also, in my reverse engineering of Crystalis I noticed (but never fully delved into) that the text is largey dictionary compressed.  There is a dictionary of sorts.  (from memory, so I may be wrong): Certain words were stored in plain text.  Some were only represented by a token, and some were mixes of tokens (word fragments) and normal letters.
<br />
<br />One would want to extract individual sentences from a corpus of text.  But compressing each sentence / paragraph on its own would be inefficient.  Personally, I think that NES text compression would be best with a global word + word fragment dictionary (like Crystalis), and then compress that token stream with something else.

<br />
<br />Basically, they used three five-bit characters per two bytes, with an indicator bit left over that marked the end of words.  Dictionary compression was also used, if my memory serves right.  These games had absolutely massive amounts of text and achieved a relatively impressive text compression (obviously nothing as efficient as DEFLATE or something like that, but still very nice) that could be implemented with minimal computational power.  It's worth giving a read, at least.

<br />I just wonder if there is a better way to encode LZ78 so it isn't so big.
<br />
<br />I hope I'm not jumbling terms here, I'm just referring to all explicit dictionary-type compression as LZ78.

<br />I don't think this is LZ78... to my knowledge, LZ78 starts with a dictionary with only the basic character set, and adds entries to it as the data is decompressed. It certainly doesn't allow random access, because of how the dictionary is generated from character combinations that are found along the way.
<br />
<br />I think LZ78 would be a bad choice for the NES, because for it to be efficient a large dictionary has to be used, possibly needing more RAM than the NES has.
<br />
<br />What you described is a generic dictionary compression, that uses pointers to strings defined in ROM, right?

<br />
<br />Interesting.  If by "huffword" you mean: Huffman compression where bit combinations could represent single characters or word fragments or entire words.
<br />
<br />I was thinking of developing the above algorithm, but with a single global dictionary.
<br />
<br />We should probably split this thread, as it is now about text compression and not "Mapper #1".
