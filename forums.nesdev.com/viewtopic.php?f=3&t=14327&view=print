My filter was close to it right before I disabled it (don't use its first revision), there's also efforts by r57shell that should be available at his github gist.<br /><br />If you could figure out how Blargg's filter works and tweak it to meet PAL needs, that's be fantastic too. I even bought a CRT TV last winter just to be able to tell exactly what's going on. And soon I'll be getting an Avermedia tuner.<br /><br />So far, I think the greatest problem with our implementaitons was that it didn't match the outcomes from tuner and TV because of arbitrary samplerate we were choosing. And because we weren't doing proper aspect ratio correction. I have some shots from my USB tuner that show what happens to the same color due to luma peaks not matching the pixels.<br /><br /><img src="http://savepic.su/6215830.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />See some kind of a wave that appears because moire phase doesn't match the pixel phase. You'd think that moire here is a sine wave? No. It's a square one! But the fact that it can't match the pixelrate results in different measures of resulting luma getting into each pixel.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">|00 01 02 03 04 05&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;03 04 05 06 07 08|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 06 07 08|<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 06 07 08|00 01 02&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |00 01 02 03 04 05&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|</div><br /><br />It's the same square wave all the time, but the exact color you see in a pixel is a sum of these 2 values that end up in it.<br /><br />Why am I describing all that?<br /><br />Because it's what you see after you apply a notch filter - at color borders. See how<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13609086/palette%20svideo.PNG">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/136 ... svideo.PNG</a><!-- m --><br />becomes<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13609086/palette%20composite.PNG">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/136 ... posite.PNG</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I was choosing wrong samplerate, so I couldn't get the same result as on the second picture. Also, there's no need to use float conversions, that's not what decoders were doing. HardWareMan has the formulas that let us just substract and add, so probably it'd be fast enough to do all this stuff on the fly, instead of my lookup tables. Then chroma merge emulation will be more or less possible.
