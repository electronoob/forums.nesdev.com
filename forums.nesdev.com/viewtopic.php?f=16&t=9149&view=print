		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'll look at it.  Pretty sure I can figure it out to some degree.<br /><br />Edit: Okay, it's a bug in MediaWiki 1.18.0 which has since been fixed in 1.18.1.  <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Thread:Project:Support_desk/Fatal_error:_Call_to_a_member_function_addWikiMsg%28%29_on_a_non-object_in_/home/username/public_html/wiki/includes/specials/SpecialLinkSearch.php_on_line_82" class="postlink">This thread</a> has the answer -- very bottom of the page, from user Bawolff.<br /><br />The solution is not as easy as just replacing $out on line 62 with $wgOut -- doing that results in an actual exception error due to lack of method LinkSearchPage::getLanguage existing and so on.<br /><br />So I took a look at <a href="http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/tags/REL1_18_1/phase3/includes/specials/" class="postlink">the 1.18.1 tag in SVN</a> to figure out what had changed.  <a href="http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/tags/REL1_18_1/phase3/includes/specials/SpecialLinkSearch.php?r1=104179&amp;r2=107901" class="postlink">Quite a lot, actually</a>.<br /><br />Given what I can see there, it looks like they revamped a very large portion of something (meaning much more than just in that single file).  I think a better idea would be to upgrade MediaWiki from 1.18.0 to 1.18.1 or even newer (latest stable is 1.19.1).  I'm happy to do that, as I think I did the last MW upgrade we had.

I couldn't get the updated extensions for 1.19 when I upgraded pineight.com/mw from 1.16 to 1.18 in late June. But now that I've checked mediawiki.org again today, it may have been fixed.

(Last week was a blur, same with the preceding weekend)<br /><br />One of the main reasons I'm lagging -- quite literally -- is that my Internet connection <a href="http://forums.comcast.com/t5/Connectivity-and-Modem-Help/Recurring-T3-timeouts-since-08-14/td-p/1379219" class="postlink">has been shit for over 3 weeks</a> (next Tuesday will make the start of the 4th week), and I don't want packet loss or drop-outs to screw up something I'm doing (and I hate GNU screen :P).  The issue is affecting multiple people in my area, not just me.  I have a technician (the 3rd one I've seen) coming out Saturday afternoon to hopefully rectify this whole thing, but I have very little faith at this point.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Internet connection this weekend has been complete shit.  In fact, today is one of the worst days yet (see graphs).  On the bright side, the tech who came out Saturday, and his supervisor, were both able to confirm that multiple customers in my immediate area are all having this problem and its been assigned to a network tech for resolution (network in this sense is a US cable industry term and refers to the actual cable network that exists within a city, i.e. equipment and wire up on poles).  I was given a general estimate of 24 hours to resolution, but its pretty obvious that no network tech is going to do shit about this until at bare minimum Tuesday (Monday is a US holiday (Labour Day)).<br /><br />So we'll have to wait on me doing the upgrade until this gets fixed, or unless tepples/WhoaMan wants to take a stab at it.

It's the only way to get shit done, sadly.<br /><br />Supposedly a network tech &quot;resolved the problem&quot; (closed the ticket) on 09/02, except he didn't put any information in it regarding what he did to fix it.  And that jibes with reality, because the situation is the exact same.  Not a single improvement.<br /><br />Comcast is sending out *another* tech this Saturday (that's the soonest they had a spot for; sigh) to try and figure out what in the fuck the previous tech supposedly did, but the vote so far (including from the CSR) is that the network tech who resolved the ticket actually didn't do a single thing.<br /><br />The level of incompetence here in the Bay Area never ceases to amaze me.  People working from 11am-4pm (plus an hour lunch), not doing their jobs, blah blah blah.  Eventually the real world is going to realise this and stop relying on Silicon Valley entirely.  So many worthless douchebags here (tell us how you really feel, koitsu!  ;-) )
