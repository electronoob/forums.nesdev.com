(I even have some ideas for a game...heck, I've even started RAM and ROM maps for it.) I'm not sure where to begin, though...I can probably design most of the game startup routine based off SMW's and the one somewhere on wikibooks.com, but there are plenty of things that I definitely wouldn't know how to do.  I do have the SNES Development manual, but it is, well, kind of the opposite of a "For Dummies" book.  (I will still be using it for some things, but...) Are there any basic homebrew tutorials anywhere, documents and stuff that would be good for that purpose? I've looked around and found some stuff (although pretty much all of it was designed for assemblers that I've never even heard of), but the one homebrew tutorial I found was very incomplete.  Does anyone have any advice, suggestions, or anything?</div>

<br />
<br />If you want to develop homebrew for SNES that's wonderful. But you need to understand 65816 programming. Then you need to learn about how things on the SNES work. Then you need to start practicing by trying to do things probably in small steps. You have to build up. There is no hold your hand tutorial. The SNES Development Manuals are intended for serious developers. That's why they don't hold your hand. There is good information in them but they make the assumption that you are a seasoned or atleast very serious developer. 
<br />
<br />So there is no "for dummies" material for SNES that I know of. You'll have to actually put in serious time into figuring it out. It's really not all that hard. I'd say the hardest part of the SNES would be dealing with the SPC sound system. But then again in general I find having to write an audio engine and tools to be something I don't want to have to do. But the good news for SNES is that atleast 2 public engines exist for playing ModTracker type music on SNES with sound effects. XMSNES and another that I can't recall the name of at the moment.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The NES is very similar, the PPU is simpler to configure (only 8 registers), and there is a lot more source code available.  There are many, many 6502 assembly programming books for beginners (it was the first low-cost CPU, after all).  Old books from the late 70's and early 80s, but it's easy to find old books online, though.  It's 100% applicable to the 65816, but I'm sure there must be some books for the 65816 specifically, not as many though.
<br />
<br />Hacking code and writing code is different, in that hacking you can only see what the code is doing, but can't easily see why the code is doing it a certain way.  It's a great way to learn about data formats though.  You definitely will want your own data format for stuff unique to your game and will have to code it, so it sounds like you've got a good idea of how to start.
<br />
<br />You'll find you can get a lot of really specific help around here, so if you have any questions, research and ask.

<br />Very true.  I plan to try to make everything fairly organized; I have a good idea how a lot of things will work.

Personally I find it's better to learn things as you need them, so you understand why you need them. Opposed to learning about something and not really using it, forgetting it, and then having to revisit it. But it depends on how you learn. 
<br />
<br />You say you are familiar with 65816 opcodes, so I think you shouldn't have too much trouble. I'm not sure if you have done much 65816 programming but atleast you have a bit of experience. It really shouldn't be that hard and there is enough documentation out there. It just isn't wrapped up in a neat package. No "For Dummies" type resources. However you can probably ask here if you have a problem and hopefully someone will be able to help you. 
<br />
<br />As Memblers said, NES and SNES have alot in common and if SNES is too much for you, NES would be a great place to start. If you get good at using the NES then stepping up to the SNES should be no problem. But it's up to you. Do whatever suits you best.

<br />
<br />Few things I've learned.
<br />
<br />-Use height and legnth defined metasprites.  Don't use a LUT for the offsets and attributes for each sprite in a metasprite.  It takes forever doing it that method.
<br />
<br />-If animating the game characters at 30 fps, a good trick is to force every object to be spawned, killed, and animated on even frames.  Take 2 frames to load the character cels on a backbuffer, switch buffers on odd frames, and delay the oam one frame to match the sprite cels.
<br />
<br />-If planing for multijointed sprites in your game, use center based coordinates instead of top left coordinates.
<br />
<br />-Using 16x16 pixel tile background mode can make background manipulation easier.
<br />
<br />-Don't be afraid to blank off the top and bottom of the screen when you need extra v-blank time.  Even if you can fit everything you need within v-blank in the beginning, it makes it harder to add more enemy types and object types without constantly changing half your code.
<br />
<br />-If you do use extra v-blank time, max it out.  Make it up with sprite usage, animation, speed and tight controls.

<br />I think what is perceived as acceptable for an oldschool 2D platformer has changed a lot since it's heyday.  Pixelized graphics and low color count were frowned upon back then, but now they are perfectly accepted for oldschool 2D fans, however choppy animation was perfectly acceptable back then, but not by today's standards.

It's rewarding replacing the sloppy and limited parts of the original game with faster/more flexible.

<br />
<br />I like this, although losing a significant amount of resolution on an already low res system may look kind of icky depending on how many lines you chop off.  Still, I'd take that over 'PAL only' games if I absolutely needed more VBL time and I couldn't just chop up one large transfer into smaller chunks with acceptable results.  If I were to make a 2D fighter with big sprites it'd be pretty much mandatory I guess.
