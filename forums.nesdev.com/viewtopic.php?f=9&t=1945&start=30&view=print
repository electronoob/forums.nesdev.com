Would it be ok to use a 3 amp pico fuse?  Thanks.

That was  10v power supply I am using that is giving me 22v on the famicom.  I just tried a 9v power supply I had and it gave me 14v.....what would be causing that?

A volt meter obviously doesn't supply much load, so you see way more than the rated value.  The power gets regulated once inside the NES/Famicom to keep a constant voltage for the parts.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Interesting.  I didn't know about the Famicom, but I don't think there was a fuse in the NES.  Yes, open is bad.  It means the circuit is broke (disconnected).  I don't know how that would've happened, but maybe it'd be worth a quick check that VCC and GND aren't shorted in there.  A 3A fuse replacement should be OK.  Or just a wire.  As long as whatever fried it is gone.
<br />
<br />22V does sound really high, must be really cheaply made or something.  Should be OK still though.  I have a 12V 1500mA supply from Radio Shack that measues ~14.6V with no load, sounds great by comparison.

I plan on replacing that as soon as I can find one.  A 3amp should work right guys?  I just want to thank everyone again for all their time, guidance, and patience with helping me out with this.  For my next stunt, I am going to try my hand at an AV mod, which shouldn't be too hard at all.  Thank you everyone who helped me with this.

<br />
<br />You should stop using that supply immediately BTW, (22V-5V)/.850A = 20W; I'd be surprised if the RF modulator chassis doesn't desolder itself :)
