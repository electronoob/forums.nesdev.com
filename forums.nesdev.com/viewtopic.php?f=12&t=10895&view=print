		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Alright I have made probably 10 reproductions for myself and have had no issues what so ever. Recently my friend wanted me to make him a copy of Zelda Parallel Worlds. I had the ROM saved from when I made a copy for myself. I am using tsop chips/adapters on type III boards (probably explained that part really bad.) I am using a GQ-3X to program the chips. I checked the ROM before programming in bsnes and it worked fine. The chips ID correctly and programmed. After the chip was programmed I test them before soldering them into the cartridges. I have a test board with a socket attached where the mask rom use to be. I place the chip I programmed into the socket and then <a href="http://videobam.com/RQdeN" class="postlink">this</a> happens(sorry crappy phone quality). Any help would be appreciated.

I'm betting that you either have a bad mounting of the tsop40 or is not programmed right.   Is parallel worlds 32 mbit?  If its smaller, maybe you need to not have the unused address lines float......<br /><br />That's all I can think of....

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I did not do a file comparison, what would be the best way to do this or is there a program that does it automatically? I bought the tsop chips pre installed to the adapter boards. I don't think its an issue with the chips because I have tried a few chips and they all do the same thing. From what I learned before since these are flash chips the entire chip does not need to be filled for them to work. <br /><br />I think it is either something with my programmer or the programming software. Is there a universal software that can be used by any programmer? Or am I stuck with the software that mine came with?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />are you on linux or windows? <br /><br />as summed up by previous posts. The two main important things:<br /><br />1) That the actual file you are flashing is perfect in itself.<br />2) That the actual ROM data on the flash chip, matches your perfect file. <br /><br />Do those steps in order.<br /><br />If you are Linux, I use a program called hexdiff for this purpose.

Open up a command prompt and run the program from there to see what arguments it accepts, and then use it from the command prompt accordingly&quot;<br /><br />If that doesn't like you, then try this binary diff program: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinDiff">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinDiff</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Let us know how that goes

The next step would be to trace the board to see which jumpers go where and what to solder together. iirc the OP said this was maybe not the problem. Still, i post..<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.buyicnow.com/pic/ADAPTER/P00002425.jpg" alt="Image" />
