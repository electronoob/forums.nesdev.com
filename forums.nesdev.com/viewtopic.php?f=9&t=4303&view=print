		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I got my PowerPak several weeks ago, but only got around to trying it out today.  Everything works great except for one thing.  There is a loud humming noise in the audio, even when there are no game sounds playing, e.g., when Super Mario Bros is paused.  The game sound effects and music are perfect, but the background hum is loud and noticeable even when the game's music is playing.
<br />
<br />Regular game cartridges do not exhibit the humming sound.  Any ideas on things I should try, in order to fix the problem?  Maybe it is ground loop noise?
<br />
<br /><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
<br />I think that I may have found the problem.  I left my NES on, but turned off the TV... and I could still faintly here the humming sound!  It turns out that the NES's AC adapter was making the same humming sound as the TV's speakers.
<br />
<br />I recently moved, and so I don't have all of my game equipment... I just have a single toaster NES and a cheap third-party 3-in-1 NES/SNES/Genesis AC adaptor.  I unplugged the AC adapter and the humming stopped, but the AC adapter was too hot to hold with bare hands!
<br />
<br />So maybe it is the cheap third party AC adapter... but that doesn't explain why official NES game cartridges don't have the humming noise.  Does anybody have any ideas?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Obviously, the PowerPak is going to draw more current than an ordinary Game Pak, with the FPGA and CF slot and all, but I wouldn't think it's enough to overload the AC adapter. My guess is that the adapter is just defective (or <em>really</em> cheap), especially if it's getting too hot to touch. O_o

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I got a Nintendo brand NES AC adapter today, and when using it, there is no hum in the audio.  The PowerPak works perfectly, and I love the fact that I don't need to move the PowerPak cartridge in order to remove/insert the CF card.
