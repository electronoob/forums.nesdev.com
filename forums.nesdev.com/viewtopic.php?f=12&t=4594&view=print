		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi all,
<br />
<br />I found a patch that changes the PAL 50hz version of the Terranigma rom into a NTSC 60hz rom. I'm very interesting in having an actual cart of this. No offense to emulators, but I just seem to enjoy a game much more if I'm playing it with accurate graphics, sound, controls, and with no chance of me save state cheating. 
<br />
<br />However, I have no way of doing this myself. I know there are people on this board that are capable of doing it. I'm sure this gets asked all the time, but I'll ask it again; will anyone here make me a US Terranigma cart? I'm willing to pay well for such a service. 
<br />
<br />If no one can do it, or if no one wants to do it, I understand. 
<br />
<br />Thanks for reading.

<br />
<br /> Otherwise you need to get an EPROM/FlashROM programmer, writable rom chips like eprom or flash, a suitable donor cartridge, and soldering skills. People do build SNES reproduction carts like this but it's not that common and I've never found anyone doing it for other people. I recommend you buy the flash cart or copier. It's more cost effective when you decide to play other SNES games.

If you can get such a board and change the mask ROM (and maybe change the pinouts as well) you should be done, but unfortuantely it's probably impossible to find 4MBx8 EPROMs. You'll have to deal with a stack of smaller EPROMs and a '138/'139 decoder.

<br />I looked into the Tototek cart, but since I only really want to play this and maybe Seiken Densetsu 3 I didn't think it justified getting an entire flash cart setup. Plus they are sold out...
<br />
<br />I've heard of the Game Doctor but I'm not sure how it works. Could you explain it a little? 
<br />
<br />Thanks for the responses.

<br />You need to use 3.5" floppy disks.  You plug it into your SNES, load the game from your disk(s), and it stays loaded as long as the power adapter is still plugged in.

I have a 6 foot or so parallel 25 pin straight thru cable that goes from my PC to my Game Doctor SF7 so I can quickly upload roms and avoid the need for floppy disks. Like Memblers said though, you could use 3.5" Floppy disks and only have to load a game whenever you change it as it will retain it's memory as long as the Game Doctor device is plugged into the electrical power. 
<br />
<br />They aren't overly expensive or anything. Since you just want to play those few games you could get a cheaper GD SF3 or a GD SF6. I have a spare GD SF3 but the floppy drive for it is dead so it'd need to be replaced. But Tototek probably has the GD SF3 in stock. Just make sure it has 32 megabits of memory. That what you need for both those games.

<br />Hello MottZilla
<br />How to configure parallel port work with game doctor? require some software?
<br />Thx.

Then you need to find the section that sets the mode of your parallel port. I believe that EPP+ECP 1.7 mode will work but I'm not 100% sure. Other than that you need to have UCon64 and you need to follow the install instructions for the driver to use the parallel port with Ucon64. Ask at the ucon64 forums if you need help.

<br />Actually I personally use 29f032 with a tsop to dip circuit board.  Works really well.

The SNES just has various bank layouts depending on the game I believe. Ofcourse if you wanted to get crafty you could try to do something to support chips like DSP, C4, SFX, etc.

<br />
<br />i've found 4Mb eproms at a lot of places, for more reasonable prices than 8s (i'm actually planning on doing this project, with an ntsc patch on the terranigma rom).  27C040 is the IBM one.  is there a reason you think they're hard to find?  i believe i'm looking at the right ones, but you have me second guessing myself
