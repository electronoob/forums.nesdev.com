Also, I think I was more annoying because I had NO clue what I was doing, and I wouldn't go try and figure out what I was doing, I'd just try and do it with little knowledge. And I may not have come off as someone who plays final fantasy, or even has ever played them. When I find out people like final fantasy, I like them a lot more as well. Not that I don't like people who don't play final fantasy, it's just a plus to me when they do.

<br />That'd be me. If Google Maps is to be believed, Tofte is on the way up to Grand Marais, am I right?

<br />It's pretty cool that you guys got to meet up and hang out, even if for only a few minutes.  What games did you get Tokumaru?

<br />Yeah, it manages to keep a lot of action going on the screen even with the low sprite count of the NES.

<br />I don't think it has so good graphics for someone who don't know the phisics of a NES very well, (well it would just look like any above-average NES game), but is you actually know how tiles and such works, and how amazingly the game uses CHRRAM, you'll end up founding that it has great graphics.
<br />What is even more impressive is the the game is NOT japanese, and it is one of the very very very few non-japanese game that has any decent design.
<br />I still prefer the graphics in Final Fantay games, because characters just look so great in battle, and enemis are so detailed. The enemies in Battletoads lack a lot of detail I found.
<br />
<br />EDIT :
<br />Celuis : Yeah, I'm a Final Fantasy fan before anything else, so about anyone who loves the series is a friend of me. Of course I'm not talking to people that just like FF8 beacause of the love scenes or to people that have just played Kindgom Hears and pretend themselves Final Fantasy fans. I mean any actual Final Fantasy fan, you see what I mean.

Someone once asked my dad, "What's that river we've been following all the way up here from Duluth?" And he was talking about Lake Superior! I don't know how you wouldn't know that you're looking at one of the world's largest lakes! I just thought that was funny.
