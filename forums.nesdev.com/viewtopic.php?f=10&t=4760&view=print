		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Forgive me for asking about something so simple, but I am paranoid about program efficiency.  This is the best way I could come up with to read all the joypad data into one byte...is it decent?  Anything you would do differently?
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$01&nbsp; &nbsp; ;strobe joypad<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $4016<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $4016<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;clc<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #0&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;clear pad 1 data<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;stx #8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;loop 8 times, once for every button<br />-&nbsp; sta pad1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda $4016&nbsp; &nbsp;;get next button state<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;adc pad1&nbsp; &nbsp; ;add the 0 or 1 into pad data<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ror&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;rotate pad data right<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;dex<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bne -<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta pad1</div>
<br />It's really short and simple, but I want to make sure I'm doing this stuff right and not, for example, doing an adc when a cmp would suffice.  I want to start off with good programming practices so I don't end up with a huge mess later.
<br />
<br />Just before I posted it I already noticed one thing to fix, I was able to eliminate one extra load/store to pad1.

<br />
<br />Also notice you don't have to clear "NewJoyPad', because it's shifted left 8 times, completely erasing every old bit in the byte. Oh, and just a tip for basically anything, remember that you don't have to use "adc" to add something like 1 and 2 together. You can just use "ora" if you're adding to cleared bits.
<br />
<br />And also, I just noticed you do lda #0 two times in a row. Remember to look for things like that when optimizing code. Sorry, don't mean to be really picky or anything  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> .
<br />
<br />Oh, also, stx #8 wouldn't do much for you. Ldx #8 I'm sure is what you meant.

<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />
<br />Also @ UncleSporky, your method won't work because $4016 doesn't give you $00/$01 like you expect -- the high bits are open bus which means you'll most likely get $40/$41.  You need to mask out the low bit(s) -- or shift them out, like Celius does.  You shouldn't use the value you get from $4016 in full.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Only bit 0 matters for strobing.  So writing 9 has the same effect as writing 1, with the advantage of setting X to 8 after the dex, so you don't need another ldx to prep your loop.
<br />
<br />Famicom controllers are build in to the system, they weren't seperate things you plug in like on the NES.  This means that replacement controllers or special controllers (like ones with turbo) had to be plugged into the expansion port and data from them is read from bit 1 (not from bit 0, because bit 0 are the built-in controllers).  Therefore checking both bits 0 and 1 makes your program more Famicom friendly.

The non-Famicom version there had a completely unrolled loop, making it about twice as fast as the others. If you want a rolled loop, you can use your shift register as a counter, leaving X and Y untouched:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; lda #%01111111<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sta NewJoyPad<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sta $4016<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; asl a&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; A = %11111110<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sta $4016<br />loop: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; lda $4016<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; lsr a<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ror NewJoyPad<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; bcs loop</div>
<br />NewJoyPad starts out with %01111111 in it, so after the first 7 RORs at the end of the loop, carry is set, and the loop continues. After the 8th ROR, carry is clear, so the loop stops.

<br />It also have a counter that counts automatically '0' to '1' transitions of the B button, for some reason I needed that in my project.
<br />I guess it's pretty much optimal, but maybe one could come with something better, anyway I'm going to use my own routines. Anyone is free to use them for any non-commercial project.

<br />By clock signal, you mean I might read out erroneous data from $4016?  Is this why some games such as Mario 3 do multiple reads, and why most games don't have anything going on while the DMA is playing?
