For the header, you could just look for it at offset (filesize%$8000)+$7FC0/$FFC0. I'm assuming the other header values you mentioned are just for the "is this really a SNES header?" check.

<br />
<br />And yes, they are all still in use, and people will mention it if you don't support them. You can thank the ZSNES team for that. *.bin is my favorite.
<br />
<br />*.smc is also used for Game Park images, standing for SmartMedia Card.
<br />
<br />Headers can also be stored at $40ffc0 or $4010c0.
<br />
<br />You can usually detect a copier header via bool hasCopierHeader = (fileSize &amp; 0x7fff) == 512; but this will fail on a lot of PD ROMs, such as koitsu's.
<br />
<br />RAM size calculation is different for SuperFX games, it is:
<br />ramSize = 1024 &lt;&lt; header[-3] &amp; 7;
<br />if(ramSize == 1024) ramSize = 0;
<br />
<br />-3 is correct, Nintendo revised the header standard to start at 7fb0, etc in later cartridges. So it would be eg $7fbd, $ffbd, etc.
<br />
<br />Detecting a SuperFX game is as "easy" as:
<br />hasSuperFX = (mapperid == 0x20 &amp;&amp; (rom_type == 0x13 || rom_type == 0x14 || rom_type == 0x15 || rom_type == 0x1a));
<br />
<br />I don't know what make_sram is or does, but if its name is not deceptive, different games will break based upon which value you fill SRAM with.
<br />
<br />Ken Griffey Jr's menu doesn't work unless SRAM is initialized to 0xff, and Powerslide FX will crash unless SRAM is initialized to 0x00.
<br />
<br />Geez, why aren't there more SNES emulators, again? :)

<br />Scroll to the top, click "this", then scroll up a few posts. It's a Python program that scans a CF card and makes blank .sav files for NES games that have the battery bit turned on because the FAT16/FAT32 driver in the PowerPak BIOS doesn't write to the directory or FAT. I wanted to extend it with Super NES support. I'm inclined to dismiss Powerslide FX because it requires Super FX, which the SNES PowerPak doesn't handle. Do Ken Griffey Jr. Presents MLB and Ken Griffey Jr.'s Winning Run use the battery?

<br />&lt;3
<br />
<br />&gt; I'll keep that in mind once PowerPak supports Super FX.

<br />Yeah, just wanted to cover the whole spectrum. Feel free to use only the relevant extensions / calculations.

<br />
<br />I don't know, just initialize to 0xFF for now, since we aren't worried about Powerslide FX. As far as we know, that is 100% compatible with all commercially released SNES games.

If NSRT reads the header and gets the information directly from the header, that could be a good start in writing a tool to create SRAMs for ROMs.

I doubt that it looks up games from a database because the program itself is 37KB. I looked to see if it was open source and could be compiled to 32bit, but it appears to be closed source. Maybe the original author would be willing to release the source since it was originally coded in 2002.

<br />
<br />In fact, NSRT does display the information about a ROM based on the information found in the internal game header. Just try for yourself: take any ROM, change, say, the ROM makeup byte and see what NSRT will come up with (in the upper part of the ROM information section).
<br />
<br />AFAIK, the only thing NSRT uses a database for is to clearly identify a ROM as a commercial game, as shown (if this is the case) in the section below the internal header information. If the ROM is not found (i.e., its CRC32 doesn't match any commercial game's in the database), a message will be shown saying that the ROM is probably corrupt.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, NSRT hasn't been updated for a while, so there are some newly discovered games that haven't been added to its database yet and thus cannot be identified, such as Cool World PAL, for example. Still, NSRT is perfect to read and verify a ROM makeup and/or its internal header information. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />(N.B. In some cases, information about a ROM actually can't be retrieved from the internal header alone. To identify e.g. Super FX2 games you need to check the filesize as well, which will be greater than 8 Mbits. Another example is the ST-018 chip, which uses the same byte value as some SPC7110 ROMs. So, in such cases, you need to check multiple things to be sure. NSRT does this for you. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />)

<br />Super NES games are 16-bit and they run on a 64-bit operating system through an emulator. Perhaps you could run CartSNS through a PC emulator: either DOSBox or VirtualBox.
