		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7288" class="postlink">Work</a> on a NES sound engine raised my interest, how much CPU time sound engines from commercial games take. I got idea that I could measure it if I mod a NSF plugin, and tried it. I took Nosefart (was easy to compile, no other reasons) and added a cycle counter into it. I'm not sure it gives correct results, though, because some numbers are somewhat strange. I would understand if the numbers were too large (some non-sound code leaved in a NSF), but they are actually unbeliveable small.
<br />
<br />For comparsion, numbers for my engine are &lt;2000 cycles average, 3866 max (measured with VirtuaNES mod).
<br />
<br />Some results for some games:
<br />
<br />Batman, first stage - 1085, 3780
<br />Battletoads, title song - 482, 1820
<br />Battletoads and Double Dragons, title song - 726, 3344
<br />Contra, first stage - 1090, 4554
<br />Megaman, Cutman stage - 2311, 7639
<br />Ferrari Grand Prix Challenge, title screen - 1583, 4317
<br />
<br />Average here is per 1000 frames.
<br />
<br />Would be interesting to compare this with results from VirtuaNES, through hacking. Experienced NSF ripper could do that rather easily.
<br />
<br />If you want the modded plugin, it is <a href="http://shiru.untergrund.net/temp1/nosefart-2.7-mod.zip" class="postlink">here</a>. It creates a text file after you stop song. When used with Winamp, seems you have to restart the Winamp to reset min/max (by some reason).

<br />
<br />I can only wonder how Rare programmers managed to make so fast player in Battletoads then. And how Capcom programmers managed to make so slow player (at times) with rather simple sound.

<br />
<br />It seems like the maximum would be the main thing to worry about.  With Megaman, Cutman stage that comes out to over 67 NTSC scanlines.  That's a lot of time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My guess is that Megaman engine optimized by data size. Let's say, Contra has 8 songs by ~1 minute long, and three jingles, and it's NSF is 17K. Megaman 1 has about 10 songs with similar durations, and few jingles, and it is just 11K. Battletoads has about 20 songs, but it's NSF is 32K - probably optimized for speed.

Also worth noting is that Tim Follin tunes (Solstice, Silver Surfer, Tom &amp; Jerry) are there in the same ballpark with Rare tunes with around 500-700 cycles avg. SMB3 also isn't too bad, only ~700 cycles on avg.
<br />
<br />Darkwing Duck title tune uses 3,7k cycles on avg.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />

<br />Min 136 Max 4076 Average 479
<br />
<br />Then the semi-completed more complex sound engine I've done (with support of more effects such as vibratoes) has this :
<br />Min 136 Max 7595 Average 3257
<br />
<br />
<br />Which is MUCH less good. It wasn't finished or optimized anyway so that's why.

<br />
<br />Bregalad, low average time is important thing, but peak time is also important, because usually it is few times greater than average, and it could introduce noticeable lag into the gameplay. Battletoads is 482 average vs 472 of your engine, but it has 1820 peak time, which is noticeably lower than 4076, so it has less chances to introduce the lag.
