<br />
<br />One thing I want to do though is install a backlight. 
<br />Is it possible to install a ds backlight. I know I'll have to peel the backing off.
<br />But if it's possible to install that backlight, where are the solder points?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah. I've seen that in the past.
<br />Wasn't too interested. Especially since it involves removing my LED.
<br />Wich would make me very sad.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I guess I'll just go trace the board and look for some solderpoints myself. Anyone got specs on the DS inverter?
<br />I just wonder if it will supply enough voltage. Hmm. Let me think. the GB has 2x2 AA's. So it's probbably around 6volts. Crap I'll tear into the DS and see if the GB will be powerful enough to add a decent backlight.

Like I said, there's a few other things I did and a few other things I'll do, but whatever.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />One thing I'm eventually going to do is swap the cpu with one from a super Gameboy. <br /><br />An smt IC with eighty legs and a pitch that tight is probably a project a bit too risky for the tools I've been using.<br />I'll probably need access to a proper soldering station and maybe a hot air rework station.  <br />Up to now, I've been doing all of my soldering with a cheap ass soldering iron from Radio Shack, a desoldering braid and other basic crap.   <br />Somehow I get by without using magnification and things like helping hands, but I'll probably use a jewelers light for the CPU. I've managed SMT soldering with what I have now, like some stuff I've done to a few Nintendo Wii's, but I'll probably play it safe this time.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mikejmoffitt wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">ironfist61 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I've also biverted this beast.</div><br />People are still using this hurray <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div><br /><br />Quite a few people are. Thanks for bringing a project that is as fun as it is useful to the world, man. ;3

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />(Darn double posts)<br />Well, I did manage to get a SBG CPU in my GB, but I cooked it when I was trying to remove it.  That damn solder just wouldn't melt! XD<br />Oh well, it's not a big deal for now and it isn't a complete waste considering I can still use the port from it in a programmer or something and the Gameboy itself is still doing okay.<br /><br /><br />--<br />Hey Mike;<br /><br />I'm thinking of doing something similar to what you did when you put the SP in a DMG case. Think I should?<br /><br />Edit: I really think I'll give it a shot. I just took a look at the SP board and noticed that the connector was a bit loose and quite a few of the traces were peeling. Pfft! That's kind of funny.
