		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1. Does the cpu check for IRQ/NMI only on the last cycle in an instruction or on every cycle?
<br />
<br />2. Can the dmc suspend the cpu for dma anytime or must it wait until

<br />
<br />3. Is the nes using the same dma-unit for sprites and dmc or does it
<br />have two separate units?
<br />

<br />
<br />Any help is much appreciated.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1. An IRQ/NMI can't interrupt the current instruction. As I understand it, the IRQ line is only looked at sometime around the beginning of the last clock of each instruction. NMI occurs if the NMI line was asserted any time since the last NMI was vectored.
<br />
<br />2. Since instruction execution in the 6502 is always overlapped, there is never a time where it is between instructions. I figure that the DMC DMA can occur any time during an instruction.
<br />
<br />3. The sprite DMA unit is almost definitely separate from the DMC's DMA unit, since the two do significantly different things. I still have more testing to figure out some odd aspects of the DMC DMA, though.
<br />
<br />4. I'd guess that the DMC gets junk data, but who knows.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />According to a 6502 doc I saw a while back, the IRQ and NMI signals are latched at falling edge of Phi-2 (corresponding to the beginning of a new cycle).  The CPU checks the line at each cycle, but will always wait for the current instruction to complete before reacting to the interrupt.  Thus, if the IRQ line went active during an instruction and was released before that instruction finished, the CPU will still handle the interrupt as long as the line was low during a falling edge of Phi-2.  (The doc stated that any hardware wanting to interrupt the processor should keep the line low for longer than one clock cycle to ensure that the change is seen.)
<br />
<br />DMA can halt the CPU at any time.  I believe DMC DMA has higher priority so sprite DMA would be delayed 4 cycles if DMC DMA were to take place, but I have no way of verifying this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I guess from your answers that a dmc dma can occur during sprite dma, but it is unknown what data it gets?
<br />
<br />I thought I had a clear picture of how dma worked in the NES, but apparently not.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />Does this mean that sprite dma also can happen any time during an instruction as long as it writes to 0x4014? Does for example a read-modify-write instruction like ASL activate sprite dma twice? Why you would do ASL $4014 is another question. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> 
<br />
<br />Are sprite dma and dmc dma using the 6502 to perform reads/writes
<br />to transfer data or do they have their own logic to perform them?
<br />
<br />
<br />Finally do anyone know if there exists a patent or document describing the internals of the 2A03 (2A07)?
<br />The ppu patent (U.S.#4,824,106) helped me a lot when trying to understand how it works.

<br />A quick test shows that INC $4014 and ROL $4014 apparently only initiate one sprite DMA transfer.

<br />That sounds like a plausible explanation. The sprite dma waits one cpu-cycle before it kicks in so the second write doesn't activate it again.
