<br />I'm glad to hear that  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> 
<br />
<br />I was surprised to see that someone else had also manufacture the same test card Super Nintendo. It took me a long time to design it, but ultimately it's really useful and easy to use.
<br />
<br />Your site is very interesting, even if it is in Japanese, it is easy to understand, there are lots of very useful information.

<br />Any luck with posting the PCB?
<br />
<br />Also, I'm following the other <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=8153&amp;start=0&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc" class="postlink">thread</a> on the TSOP adapters. Is it true that the Type I ROMLAB style boards can't be programmed directly? Or rather, to state for clarity:
<br />
<br />Which boards can be used for writing to the EPROM through the adapter? What steps need to be taken to ensure this is possible? "Why?" is also good to know! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />I know that my adapter works fine for Type II boards, I have never owned a Type I, so I cannot speak for those, but I do not see why it wouldnt if the jumpers on the end are set correctly.

<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.retrohacker.info/pcb-cads/WillemSNESAdapter.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Here is a link directly to the CAD files:  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.retrohacker.info/pcb-cads/WillemSNESAdapter.zip">http://www.retrohacker.info/pcb-cads/Wi ... dapter.zip</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Laen's PCB service located at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://dorkbotpdx.org/wiki/pcb_order">http://dorkbotpdx.org/wiki/pcb_order</a><!-- m --> is a great place to have these made up.  It should cost right about $8 to have 3 boards made up from this design.
<br />
<br />This adapter is also useful for reading back original Mask ROMs,  that is how I verified my Seiken Densetsu 3 rom file.  This is completely based on someone elses design, but unfortunately I cannot find the original site to properly credit it.  If I find it, I will be sure to update this.
<br />
<br />EDIT:  It was Peccost!  His links are 404'ing now, which is why I didnt see it.  Peccost, if you are reading this, thanks for your original design!  This is a slight modification of yours and published as a set of Gerbers.

<br />Routing, spacing, and labeling will obviously differ as there are thousands of ways to make a round wheel, but in the end they are all just that.. a round wheel.

<br />Question for you, the A19/A20/A21 connector on the side. What should that end up being connected to?

<br />
<br />Those should connect to the appropriate headers on your willem-type programmer.
<br />
<br />The Willem programmer only has 32 pins providing no socket location for A19-21, so you jumper them to the additional address lines header on the board.
<br />
<br />Here is a photo for reference, this is of the GQ-3X programmer, but it should be similar for others.

<br />I'm still waiting for the adapter from the DorkbotPDX PCB order... apparently there was a mixup at the board fabrication place so it's running super late. :\ I guess I could breadboard one in theory, but that seems like a pretty silly investment of time at the moment!
