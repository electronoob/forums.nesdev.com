Rotation is slightly more practical with square pixels, especially for sprites such as Sonic the Hedgehog that appear unrotated most of the time and rotated occasionally.

It could draw 1 BG layer per scanline and draw sprites on the last.<br /><br />On the other hand if you're going analog route, doesn't Sega Saturn have a GBA-style VDP where it's clocked 4x the pixel rate?

Most all games I've played on any 2D system don't take into account the PAR for object speed either; you'll play overhead games where ovals are shrunk/stretched to be circles, but the player will still move faster across one axis. I personally wouldn't even bother about the 8:7 PAR on the SNES if I were designing a game (not just an engine); it causes more of a headache (and even a possible performance hit; it's more difficult to do sub pixel movement) than it improves the visuals, especially considering that most people would probably play it on an emulator in 8:7 anyway.

If the 448x224-pixel video output is at this same rate, then it'd be awfully narrow through a SuperGun (JAMMA to NTSC converter). My <a href="https://pineight.com/mw/?title=Dot_clock_rates" class="postlink">dot clock rate list</a> describes how each system would appear on a standard 4:3 TV through a SuperGun, though the PAR in practice may differ because of nonstandard active picture periods that many arcade PCBs use and for which an arcade technician is expected to adjust the display.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Sumez wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">the CPS2 has a more awkward horizontal resolution, considering it's still running on 4:3 monitors:</div><br /><div class="quotetitle">psycopathicteen wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I do wonder if Capcom's development set used computers with their weird PAR.</div><br />Incidentally, the pixel aspect ratio of CPS and CPS2 is very close to the 3:4 PAR of the Commodore 64 and Apple IIGS super hires.<br /><br />For X68000's monitor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X68000" class="postlink">Wikipedia's article</a> claims 15 kHz, 24 kHz, and 31 kHz modes, one of which has 640x480 square pixels. In this case, zooming by 3x4 would theoretically fit 213x120 pixels of a sprite sheet on the screen at essentially correct PAR.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />CV1000 games run at a fairly &quot;normal&quot; resolution (I think it's actually perfectly 4:3), I was referring to the game they made for the PGM system (Daioujou, Espgaluda and Ketsui), though other shooters for PGM obviously have the same issue - not sure if there are any except from Bee Storm.<br /><br />I don't understand what you are asking though? I've run some PGM games through a supergun, and they show up fine on my consumer TV, with the expected overscan. My supergun doesn't convert JAMMA to NTSC though, not sure why you'd want them to do that. Sounds like a horrible thing to do. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

The point(s) are these:<br /><br />-Electronics break with age and use, so older equipment may be sooner to break. <br />+counterpoint: but older equipment was often made with made-to-last components, designs and techniques, unlike the designed for the dump philosophy of today<br />+and when something break, it's often the matter of replacement of a single or a few components. If they're not smd/smt; easy peasy provided you can identify the problem.  <br />-But it doesn't matter. When something breaks, most people drive it to the dump, not for repairs.<br />-Most of all, people drive their crt:s to the dump anyway, functioning or not, because they aren't used anymore and/or because they want something newer. What we see is a rapid diminishing of the existence of CRT screens.<br /><br />EDIT: Pokun beat me to it.<br /><br />Maybe NESdev shouldn't be designing a new console, but a new retro gaming monitor  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

Just like how new dot matrix displays are more expensive nowadays than a much higher resolution full color LCD screen.
