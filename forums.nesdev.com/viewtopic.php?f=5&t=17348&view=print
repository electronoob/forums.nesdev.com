		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The NES vs Commodore 64 discussion a while back made me wonder what exactly the Commodore 64's video hardware is. Unlike for other 2D based systems, Wikipedia doesn't do too great a job of explaining it. My initial question because it left me a bit confused: are the colors used by each tile actually unique (they don't just reference a palette)? Also, about tiles either being double width 4bpp or 2bpp, what basis can you change this on, or can each tile decide? It says sprites are 24x21 pixels tall, which seems a little odd... It doesn't say how the colors are defined for these either, unless every sprite can freely choose.<br /><br />One last thing: does graphics data reside in main ram or somewhere else? Regardless of the fact that this will eat all of your already limited ram, with the tilemap, is it at all possible to change vertical scroll and have 8 tilemaps in a row for 8x1 pixel attributes like you theoretically can with the SNES? I can see this having a dramatic impact on graphics; you could just about seamlessly go between 4bpp and 2bpp modes.<br /><br />And I figured that while I'm at it, I might as well ask about the Amiga 500 because Wikipedia is even worse here... I've heard the Amiga has either one 6bpp layer or two 3bpp layers, but other than that there's somehow no penalty for having to access more tilemap data (like on the SNES where every new layer consumes an additional 2bpp beyond the color depth) there's this:<br /><br /><img src="https://s.mprd.se/GameBase%20Amiga/Screenshots/A/Agony_2.png" alt="Image" /><br />It's still only 6bits of color depth between all the layers (I was really surprised to find out that the rear most layer is only 1bpp...) but yeah.<br /><br />The Amiga also can't get away with defining what colors to use for every tile like the Commodore 64, but I can't find anything on color other than that the Amiga has a 12bpp master palette.

The C64 only has <em>(edit)</em> one fetch pattern; its different modes are more like the CGA than the SNES. Every 8x8 HiRes pixel zone has its own unique 12-bit attribute, and the mode just changes how those 12 bits are interpreted.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 67%; line-height: normal"><s>Unlike the VIC-20&#39;s VIC-1, where the tilemap actually addresses three 4-bit wide RAMs and the portion of address space corresponding to the attribute data is open bus for the upper 4 bits, the C64 uses 64K x 8 of DRAM, so</s> it's vaguely a shame that the attribute data isn't 8 bits wide. It'd've been nice to have more variable colors per tile.</span>

Of course, the large advantage of such a design is the ability to randomly access the memory the video hardware is currently addressing.<br /><br />Actually, C64's main RAM bandwidth is insufficient to feed the VIC-II.  That's why the C64 has a separate 1024 x 4 SRAM for use as colour attribute memory.  It is accessed in parallel to the character pointer data during the badlines.<br /><br />If you want a fully comprehensive run down on the VIC-II then you can't do much better than look at <a href="http://www.zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/vic-ii.txt" class="postlink">this document</a>.<br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Multicolor Bitmap ignores the upper 4 bits, and uses the lower 8 bits to specify one of 16 colors for two of the four shades for each 8x8 region.</div><br />All 12 bits are used.
