I kinda want to do that again, but with more people if there's interest? I've noticed there's at least several other nesdev people in the midwest US.<br /><br />It'd probably be during a weekend in the summer, and in Fort Wayne, Indiana. I can serve <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DVO_u8bW4AADYbf.jpg:large" class="postlink">homemade pizzas</a> or get Little Caesars or something.<br /><br />Activity plans/ideas:<br /><ul><li> Nova the Squirrel (hopefully) completed and playable</li><li> play homebrew games and show off yours</li><li> Four Score games</li><li> Bomberman (II, Mega, Party Edition, 64)</li><li> losing to me in Pokémon Puzzle League</li><li> four player Duck Game</li><li> anything else that sounds fun, especially retro-gaming related</li></ul><br />&quot;Guaranteed&quot; attendance is FL4SHK (whose availability will determine when it can be) and tepples (who I can drag over from next door). Anyone else interested?<br /><br />edit: To make it clear, this is a non-alcohol and non-smoking event. Be sober.

I feel like Saturday's probably the best weekend day since people are likely to be free the entire day, but aside from that I don't think either FL4SHK or I have any reason to prefer any over any other.

I think Memblers was gonna try and talk kev into going too.<br /><br />That's about 8 people total so far (and presumably 6 cars)? I <em>think</em> there's room for parking, both around my house and in a parking lot near the house.

I'll poke some people.<br /><br />---<br /><br />It looks like attendance is gonna be about 6 or 7? I don't think there's any real start or stop time since unlike a real convention there aren't any scheduled events, just really more of a &quot;let's do whatever sounds fun&quot;; FL4SHK is staying the night before so he, Tepples, and I will already be there no matter when you arrive. I would probably target noon or 1 PM though, or just the afternoon in general. If anyone needs the address still they can PM me since I don't feel comfortable putting it out in public record anywhere.<br /><br />Reminder that this isn't a place to drink or smoke, though I guess if you need to smoke you can do it outside away from the house.

I think the idea was to have a race, but the big screen was running the official release and the CRT was running a beta so it probably wouldn't have been super fair to race different versions.
