This could be bad news on a cartridge dumper that has a new mapper you're trying to reverse engineer.  Is it the cart?  The mapper?

I certainly trust the math more than your experimentation.  I don't say this to be rude, it's just that math doesn't lie and therefore I cannot trust your experiment.<br /></div><br /><br />While I can believe that you may not trust my experiment, that's a pretty bold thing to say that math proves what I've done IMPOSSIBLE.  Perhaps it's just the engineer in me speaking but if you go through life solely trusting math and not physical occurrences you're in for a rude awakening...<br /><br />The main problem with relying completely on math is it's easy to make erroneous assumptions that throw all your math down the drain.  <br /><br />Your statement is especially surprising to me when you have made ZERO measurements yourself (or at least not very accurately).  I'm really not sure where all your numbers are coming from.  Those 1.651 and 1.618mm measurements correspond to nothing physical with NES carts or these connectors.  I measure cart contacts as around 1.9mm wide, it's not the easiest thing to measure but I'm not off by .4mm, also my pins on the connector are 1.37mm wide not your 1.618mm<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">teaguecl wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />However, I readily admit that it is possible that my math is flawed.  My diagram shows two pcb edges, it does NOT show the connector itself.  The metal on the connector is probably a little narrower than the trace on the PCB, which might impact the calculation.<br /></div><br /><br />You're right about this...<br /><br />Your picture with pins 1 perfectly aligned and pins 36 and 35 halfway overlapping is PHYSICALLY impossible with this connector and standard NES carts.  With only 0.019" (0.48mm) of free play means that the cart can only fall .24mm off center.  <br /><br /><br />You're drawing shows the cart having 2.88mm of free play <br />72*(2.54-2.50mm)<br />You're allowing the cart to fall 1.44mm off center which is a "mathematical" error of 500%<br /><br />You can draw everything much math as you want but really the measurement comes so close that you can't say without  doubt what will happen.  Mainly because having the slack, trace, or pin widths off by a 0.01mm makes or breaks the final answer.  Especially since the pins have some curvature to them so they aren't making physical contact on their extreme edges.<br /><br />Now I will point out some assumptions that I have made that may cause issues.<br /><br />*Width off cart traces and connector pin width.  If these were to be different for things like the powerpak, unofficial carts, or other female connectors you may very well have issues.<br /><br />*Cart wear.  I did some more testing with other carts.  Turns out I was actually able to ground out PRG A11 with one of my carts.  It's a heavily worn SMB3.  It took me awhile to realize why that cart had issues the others didn't.  The reason was because of wear.  The cart actually had enough wear to slide far enough to cause that issue.  But I placed the board inside the case and inserted it like it normall would be into the NES.  The only way I was able to get the pins to short was prying (and holding) it over with a screw driver.  The lessened clearance caused by using the case forced the cart back over when I released my screw driver.  I had to be actively applying the force to cause problems.<br /><br />I could see if a cart were in REALLY bad shape you could have more issues.<br /><br />* proper alignment on the NES motherboard.  Like I've stated before there is more slack with this connection and it's easier to cause problems.  With my homemade 72 pin connector properly aligned during install has no issues.<br /><br />In conclusion, I agree these connectors aren't perfect.  However in my opinion they're a pretty damn good solution considering what other options are out there.  Especially when doing a project like a cart dumper or programmer when you'd rather not sacrifice a toploader to get a easy to manage female cart connector.  Ben Heck's solution is even better if you're concerned, and you can't argue, Ben's a genius.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Fri Jun 24, 2011 7:59 pm</p><hr />

In a previous (somewhat recent) thread Super-Hamster also said that connector worked, it's surprising.  He also posted a picture of an NES clone with a cart in it, and the connector pitch clearly didn't match the cart.  For all we know, every NES clone could be using the wrong pitch and that's why the PowerPak doesn't work (maybe it also doesn't work on a 60-pin clone with an adapter, I don't know).  Not having an NES clone, or NES-to-FC adapter, I can only speculate.<br /><br />I'm making an NES cartridge that does use the expansion pins, and I will be a little peeved if that stops it from working in clone systems.  It's hard to believe, seems like there must be some kind of consequence.  Maybe I can make the pin thinner or in a different position or something, would be kind of a lame solution though.<br /><br />And this is how stuff gets discovered, by people not knowing that something is supposed to be impossible. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Jun 24, 2011 2:38 pm</p><hr />

The "sweet spot" where the contention is in the middle of the board is 4 pins wide, or 4 * 2.5mm = 10mm.  So you have a 10mm range in which the contention is occurring on the unused expansion pins, so it shouldn't be too hard to place the cart in this range - and it sounds like mechanically your connector prevents it from going outside this range.  That's good news.<br />You still seem to be claiming that your connector doesn't have any contentions.  That I do not believe, the math proves it to be impossible, regardless of what your multimeter says <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.

My diagram shows two pcb edges, it does NOT show the connector itself.  The metal on the connector is probably a little narrower than the trace on the PCB, which might impact the calculation.  Of course the pitch cannot be different, so contention is still unavoidable - but it might not be exactly every 22 pins.  It is also possible that the space between the traces on the pcb edge are not exactly 0.882mm as I have on my diagram.  Again, this could throw off the "22 pin" number - but ultimately does not avoid the problem.<br />Having admitted the math could be  flawed, I invite someone to show where it is wrong!  You're counter argument is "the connector works", which even if it is true - does not shine any light onto how that could be possible.<br />I'm glad that your adapter is working for you, it's not my intention to argue about it.  I'm simply trying to get at the truth and to document the reason behind the limitations of using the 2.54mm adapters.<br />I have an order to place at digikey soon anyway, maybe I'll throw one of these in so I can verify myself.  Or I could dig out the one I bought 8 years ago from digikey, maybe it shrank a bit while resting in the closet <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29">teaguecl</a> — Fri Jun 24, 2011 1:33 pm</p><hr />

The only place that there was enough free play to cause problems was on the mobo.  But you shouldn't be too concerned about that.<br /><br />I've been using my homemade 72 pin connector all week and I'm loving it.<br /></div><br /><br />I really would like to put an end to rumor that the 2.54mm pitch edge connectors work.  They don't.  I drew up a diagram of a 2.50mm edge, and also a 2.54mm edge to show the problem:<br /><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/477050/nesedge.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />As you can see looking from left to right, the pitch difference starts to be a problem quickly.  By pin 22 you have a mathematically guaranteed contention.  You simply cannot have more than 22 pins in a row line up.  The difference in pitches is 0.04mm.  The space between pads is 0.882mm.  So, 0.882 / 0.04 = 22.05.  22 pins and you're screwed.<br /><br />But, you say, my connector is working fine and I have proof!  No, you don't.  You have contentions that aren't producing noticeable problems.  Why?  Because the conflicting pins aren't used.  Look at this picture of MMC3:<br /><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/477050/mmc3pcb1.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />Lots of unused pins in the middle.  These are pins 16-20, which are Expansion[0-4].  On the reverse side of the board in the middle are Expansion[5-8]. Other carts do have pads for these pins, and could potentially use them,:<br /><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/477050/cleaned.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />So, by sliding your cart back and forth you can shift around where the contention happens - but you cannot avoid it.  This will work for some carts,others it won't.  It certainly won't work for anything that uses the expansion pins.  It will not work at all for a project like mine - where all 72 pins need to be used (we were going to use the EXP pins as chip select and control for the flash on the devcarts).<br />My original drawings (QCAD) are here if you'd like to check the measurements: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/477050/nes_edge_both.dxf" class="postlink">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/477050/nes_edge_both.dxf</a><br /><br />Ben Heck confirmed the problem here:<br /><a href="http://benheck.com/nes-micro" class="postlink">http://benheck.com/nes-micro</a><br /><br />I hope this ends the ambiguity over these connectors.  They are not proper replacements for the original.  They may work for you, depending on your requirements, but will require positioning the cartridge <em>just right</em>.  If you mechanically set it up so that the contention is in the middle, you're mostly OK.  If not, you could short GND to VCC, and your cart and/or your console will release it's magical smoke.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29">teaguecl</a> — Fri Jun 24, 2011 11:43 am</p><hr />
