My Commodore 1942 monitor has this effect.  It has a button for selecting a widened screen (NES display fits exactly in the tube) or narrow screen (Amiga, Neo-Geo need this), and in widened mode, sometimes the image can &quot;bend back&quot; on the left side of the screen when I adjust the H-Pos dial.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=355">ccovell</a> — Mon Nov 24, 2014 6:23 pm</p><hr />

Alright, thanks for your answers. Really insightful.<br /><br />It would still be nice to find some general article about this topic, though, and maybe a number about how common this was for CRT TVs.

I can recreate your problem by going into the service menu of my CRT TV and shifting the image too far to the left. When the beam starts striking areas that aren't the face, it ends up in the wrong places and looks funny.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5314">mikejmoffitt</a> — Sun Nov 23, 2014 10:56 pm</p><hr />

Let's remember that the NES borders aren't really within &quot;hblank&quot; (even though they're often called that from a programming point of view), they're part of the active area of the picture. From what I've been able to find, the active area in NTSC spec is 52.6 ± 0.2 µs. If we calculate the length of NES scanline with borders, it comes down to (256+15+11)/(21.47727273 MHz/4) = 52.5206349 µs, which is well within the spec. (Note that 0.2 µs correponds to roughly one PPU pixel.)<br /><br />That said, I have not verified how well within the spec the rest of the scanline timings are.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=80">thefox</a> — Sun Nov 23, 2014 10:02 pm</p><hr />

My mistake. I thought he meant the picture was physically reflecting off of the screen's bezel and back onto the glass. I see what you mean though, and that makes more sense. I remember playing with an old B/W TV's horizontal-hold knob, and seeing crisp picture data crawl back onto the screen (backwards and stretched) when it went too far off the side, and I honestly didn't think the NES's signal was SO off-spec that it'd do that. Now that I understand, I agree with you.<br /><br />Also, as a side note, my &quot;haze&quot; artifact has a rainbow effect to it instead of a solid color, but it otherwise looks the exact same as the screenshots in the first post, including it being stripey. My TV is a Panasonic though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Sun Nov 23, 2014 9:43 pm</p><hr />

It happens on my CRT too. It is the currently-selected background color being drawn <em>before horizontal-retrace has ended</em>. It isn't physical light reflections or anything, it is legitimately an artifact being drawn on the screen by the electron gun. Thefox is correct in that the background color is drawn as a border around the visible portion of the frame, but if the border goes too far off the left side of the screen, it creeps into the horizontal-blanking portion of the scanline, which is supposed to be black, and creates that hazy glow on the left side of the picture if the offending content is bright enough. I've noticed this on standard cable tv too, so it's not a problem specific to the NES.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Sat Nov 22, 2014 9:58 pm</p><hr />

(It wouldn't be difficult to do this on a computer monitor and see what happens. Unfortunately, the only CRT monitor I have is in storage due to its limited usefulness since LCD monitors became affordable.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">DRW wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />And what's the technical explanation that some scenes in NES games produce those green stripes, but most don't?<br /></div>There's a bright line on the left side of the screen, and a good chunk of it is outside the usual display area. Some of it reflects back into the display area, and the black background is dark enough that you can see the reflection.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5948">Joe</a> — Sat Nov 22, 2014 6:38 pm</p><hr />
