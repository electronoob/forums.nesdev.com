<br />As far as processors go, this is very very simple.  Yes, it would still take a long time to trace everything out, but hopefully that will not be necessary.
<br />
<br />For instance, the ROM bits can be read out easily now.  Maybe just by the frequency of opcodes, someone can get good ideas of what they do. 
<br />
<br />Also, if we can identify parts of the circuit (adder, comparator, register (maybe that is the sole purpose of the SRAM), program counter, etc) then we can understand a lot without tracing every single line.

<br /><img src="http://www.neviksti.com/CIC/tutorial/ROM_bits.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />I hope that helps some.  It is hard to describe these things.
<br />
<br />Anyway, if you browse the pictures, it looks like a sizeable portion of the ROM is unused.
<br />
<br />---------------------------
<br />EDIT: I just realized something.  Can someone with a logic analyzer setup test a chip that can be key or lock?  Keep rerunning the system and pulse the lock/key pin at different times to determine when the CPU checks the pin.  This way we can identify the cycle times that certain instructions are ran.
<br />
<br />Also, as a side project reverse engineering a different chip, I noticed that observing the current through the GND pin of the chip while the chip ran allowed one to identify loop times and from there roughly determine instructions.  If that works for this chip as well, it would be very useful.  (Since we also have the rom in this case, it is extra useful.)
<br />
<br />I did all that with borrowed equipment, which I don't have access to now.  Can one of you fellows with the logic analyzer and oscilloscope look into that for us?  I'm really curious to see the results.

<br />Nope, you just open up the NES and break off the 4th pin of the lockout chip.  Then supposedly solder it to GND, but I think most people don't do that step and it seems to be just fine (must be TTL, so that's probably OK).

<br />
<br />I see. So generally spoken, the lockout chip is no real showstopper for a simple cartridge release and this discussion is rather of academic interest? Or is that kind of mod rather uncommon within todays userbase?

<br />For small quantity releases (which any release now would be), it is not much of a problem to obtain CIC chips (as for disabling it instead, I think requesting general users to disable the system CIC is a bit unreasonable, but most people involved in homebrew would probably be okay with it).  So yes, in that sense this is only of "academic interest".
<br />
<br />But, like all others here, I do the things I do because it is an enjoyable hobby.  I really like trying to figure out how stuff works, and learning more about hardware along the way.  There is a goal in this case (figuring out Nintendo's secret) which makes it even more enjoyable for me, because nothing motivates like an interesting challenge.  Of course it is also nice to know that people could "emulate" the CIC chip for a cartridge if we succeed, but it is not the driving force (for me at least).
<br />
<br />----------
<br />Anyway, back on topic, the original reason we focussed on the Tengen chip was because we hoped it would be an easier way to get a peek into the algorithm.  Unfortunately it appears as custom as Nintendo's chip.  It was neat to see the top layers removed, but now that we know we can expose and read the circuitry ... I think I'm going to go back and focus on the actual CIC.  If I figure that out, we immediately can understand the code from the CIC of the SNES, NES, and its regional variations. Also, the real CIC appears to be organized better (which may make it easier to identify functional blocks).
<br />
<br />Or can someone think of a reason the Tengen might still be easier?
