There are a lot of holes in it though that could be filled.  I do not yet consider myself qualified to write articles <em>on</em> the Wiki because even though I have been lurking and around in the whole NESdev area for quite some time now.  I'm just beginning now to take the time to understand the workings aside from the audio portion.
<br />
<br />In summary:  The Wiki needs more articles.  I'm a moron; but an assertive moron, so I'll push others to include the information that it needs.
<br />
<br />Also if this is an environment that needs to be disheveled to be conducive to learning, then so be it.  I relate being an artist -- or a struggling artist in the least.

The first thing to do is segregate the low-level debug primitives (functions and whatnot) from the user interface; make the interface modular, interchangeable with any interface. Then you define how the debug primitives interact with the interface via a communications link; make the communications link modular, able to establish communication using any number of interchangeable modules for TCP/IP sockets, operating system pipes, RS232, USB, etc. Next, you define the protocol; make the protocol modular, a 'universal language' that describes generic debug primitives, and allow it to be extensible as necessary. Finally, you define those debug primitives and provide a base implementation that can be expanded if required. However, a well-defined set of primitives is unlikely to need expansion for anything but the most exotic architecture configurations.</div>
<br />Could we start with the GDB protocol? Or would that work only for the 32-bit machines that the GNU operating system targets?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The GDB protocol is established, which is nice, but there is a slight problem with it: The protocol does not allow binary data to be sent. In interfaces which might want to update a PPU viewer in real-time, you will have to encode the PPU data to ASCII characters (0x94 becomes "94", for example) which has the side effect of doubling the bandwidth requirements.
<br />
<br />Its use of a specific start/end sequence and a checksum indicates that it is really designed for a raw communications link which does not provide synchronization or cyclic redundancy checking. So it is great for very simple serial communication, but poor for TCP/IP or pipes/sockets.
<br />
<br />Another problem is that it does not provide access to multiple memory maps. So you would have to establish a standard of some sort for accessing CPU, PPU, PRG, Sprite memory, etc. using the GDB commands for reading/writing memory (m/M respectively). [Not to mention related problems dealing with a lack of a well-defined command to describe the target architecture.]
<br />
<br />And it would be very cool to use GDB with an NES target. Unfortunately, GDB hasn't had 65816 support since 2001, and has never supported 6502. So if you can't use GDB, why constrict yourself to the GDB protocol?
<br />
<br />
<br />There's also <a href="http://xdebug.org/docs-dbgp.php" class="postlink">DBGp</a> which uses XML+TCP/IP, but obviously adds a LOT of overhead. And the <a href="http://h30097.www3.hp.com/docs/base_doc/DOCUMENTATION/V50_HTML/ARH9QATE/DOCU_031.HTM#remote_debug_prot_sec" class="postlink">Ladebug Remote Debugger Protocol</a>, using simple UDP/IP packets with a 16-byte header. Finally, <a href="http://www.rfc-archive.org/getrfc.php?rfc=909" class="postlink">RFC-909 - Loader Debugger Protocol</a>, which looks a bit closer to what I had in mind.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Parasyte, I'm on board.  Years ago I implemented GDB debugging over TCP/IP into my emulator.  I ran into all the issues you mentioned (specifically having 2 address spaces), and modified the protocol to suit my needs.  That meant no more using gdb/ddd, so I started writing my own debugger interface.  I modeled off of the best debugger I've ever used, SoftIce.
<br />I was never really happy with any of it, though I love the approach.  If we can decide on a good protocol, get some buy in from a few emulator authors to support it, then I'd love to write a new debugger.  Maybe someone would want to do it as a plugin to Eclipse?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />teaguecl: That's about what I would expect. Thanks for confirming. Did you look over LDP (RFC 909) yet? I think it might be a very good starting point, since it's already designed to support multiple architectures and has a lot of room for extension. It's also well suited for TCP/IP. I'm thinking that's the one to build from, or at least barrow [a lot of] inspiration from.
<br />
<br />The last time I tried Eclipse, it was too bloated for my tastes so I wouldn't be the one to write a plugin for it. But I imagine it could be done without much trouble.
<br />
<br />tepples: Yes and no. It's certainly <em>possible</em> to define a generic 24-bit address space for NES, but what happens when you want to add support for SNES? Do you shift it to 32-bit address space? And when you want to add DS support later? 40-bit address space? What about 64-bit architectures like ia64/x64? Virtualizing the address space would compromise the idea of using an architecture-independent protocol.
<br />
<br />LDP's proposed solution to this problem is fairly simple:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">4.3.1&nbsp; Long Address Format<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The long address format is five words long and consists of a<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;three-word&nbsp; address&nbsp; descriptor and a two-word offset &#40;see Figure<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;9&#41;. The descriptor specifies an address space to which the offset<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;is applied.&nbsp; The descriptor is subdivided into several fields, as<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;described below.&nbsp; The structuring of the descriptor&nbsp; is&nbsp; designed<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to&nbsp; support&nbsp; complex&nbsp; addressing&nbsp; modes.&nbsp; For example, on targets<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;with&nbsp; multiple&nbsp; processes,&nbsp; descriptors&nbsp; may&nbsp; reference&nbsp; &nbsp;virtual<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;addresses,&nbsp; registers,&nbsp; and&nbsp; other&nbsp; entities&nbsp; within a particular<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;process.</div>
<br />Address spaces would be accessed using the "ID" field in the descriptor, which separates it from the address. Seems like an elegant way to handle it.
