		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I work for a guy who owns a professional recording studio, and he owes me some time in the studio.  I don't have anything I want to record right now, but I was thinking......
<br />
<br />If you guys would like to have any reference recordings made of things like volume levels and frequency response, etc, this would be a good chance to get some very clean recordings.  i'm talking about preamps costing tens of thousands of dollars going into a Protools HD system, etc etc.  The NES would definitely be the weakest link in the chain lol
<br />
<br />the only thing I ask is that these recordings be for reference use for the greater good of the community.  I'm not offering to record people's chiptunes (though if you're really interested in recording your chiptunes, pm me and perhaps we can work something out <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />)  I'll post up the full quality wav files.  these can be used by emu makers and chip tune composers, hell sample them i don't care.
<br />
<br />I will have a power pak in the next few weeks so it would be cool to have some demos and various audio tests ready to go. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i'm not taking about making samples for DPCM, i'm talking about recording output from the NES
<br />
<br />I know people have been wondering things like that is the frequency response of the nes hardware, what kind of noise the PPU adds to the signal, etc.  this is a chance to record the nes output without worrying about contamination in the recording chain 
<br />
<br />i know there are already a few demo which test various audio capabilities.. i was just wondering if people wanted to make some more and have me record them

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can't think of any hardware tests that would benefit from a low-noise high-resolution sampler. All the measurements we're interested in are much more coarse than that. The worst contamination you'll get is the PPU's video signal, followed perhaps by the 60 Hz hum of the power transformer.
