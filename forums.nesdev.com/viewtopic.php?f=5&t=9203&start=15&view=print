I've seen people break the screen by just hitting the screen hard, although that's their standard way of doing it. And even small things like mechanism for buttons need to be tested more than they are. Like I said, if it was a money grab, they'd keep doing it. But they're not, so there's no scam going on at all.

(Once I was on some IRC, and they made some Nintendo DS homebrew program, I told them my L/R broke and they told me that the L/R does nothing in that program anyways for exactly that reason, because many of L/R broke buttons!)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Why don't PC makers try to take a bite out of the console market by promoting a set-top gaming PC? They haven't really done a good job of making it clear that a PC's HDMI output works with a TV's HDMI input.</div>I hate HDMI.<br /><br />With help from someone else I have mostly made up a different digital video cable called &quot;Digi-RGB&quot; which is very simple, can use any resolution and uses eight bits per RGB channel (four clocks per pixel), all data is in one direction and it consists of eight balanced pairs labeled: RED0, RED1, GREEN0, GREEN1, BLUE0, BLUE1, CLOCK, SYNC. It may be adjusted slightly in future, and physical specification does not yet exist, nor does any implementation. (Resolution is known by clocks per sync)<br /><br />I am in the process of designing a computer system which connect to TV and is primarily for games. It is not PC; it is a new system with its own hardware and software, all of which are open source and fully documented in the manual (although external hardware/software may not be). It has Forth and BASIC interpreter built-in, and is a single-tasking system; it can run native code too. System call interface is hardware-based; some of the hardware is restricted to use by the BIOS (including reading the BIOS ROM, hard drive, optical drive, debugger, and setting interrupt vectors), and is accessed by the &quot;S&quot; pin of a flipflop which will trigger NMI as well as enable these components, so the BIOS can access them. These restrictions can be bypassed by moving jumpers to allow everything access to full hardware. So it is a security system similar to how UNIX systems require the user to have permission to do certain things but instead is implemented in hardware, and the user can always bypass this and access everything anyways. It won't have HDMI; it will probably have composite video out, component video out, stereo audio out, stereo audio in. It also support game controller, USB, and infrared remote control. Not all details are yet known, however, but one thing known is it lack copy protection and is too difficult to implement malware and DRM.

And yeah, GBA+SP L/R buttons sucked too. They just can't get them right.<br /><br />And yes it was normal wear and tear. They were playing, they hit the screen just like the did hundreds of times before, and it cracked. They didn't jab it in a raging fit, they were playing it. They play a little more aggressive than me and I'm a pretty damn good and hard gamer, but still wasn't anything terrible IMO.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm really amazed that I was able to pull off a L/R button repair on a GBA SP by shoving wads of aluminum foil next to the contacts to make the plastic press on the buttons harder.<br /><br />The L/R buttons are made up of several pieces.  There's the plastic part you normally press with your fingers, and the plastic part that pushes a tiny lever to hit the button.  The button has a little rubber thingy covering it up, there's a thin black button behind that.  When I had the GBA SP in pieces, I was able to hit the black button with a screwdriver and it registered as a button press.  So I figured that I needed to put more &quot;stuff&quot; in there, so it would hit the black button more easily.  And I just happened to use wadded-up aluminum foil for that.  And it worked.  Working L/R buttons that have held up well.<br />But I haven't tried this on any other kind of system.

Not really the focus of the thread, though... what Tepples was trying to point out was another opportunity for PC manufacturers to cut in to the gaming market...<br /><br /><br /><br />I've found that (ugh) putting the corner of the DS or GBASP with the shoulder button on your lips and blowing extremely hard seems to help the shoulder buttons for a good few hours. It's a good temporary quick fix!

Not exactly the same situation, but it falls into the category of those that want it can get it, everyone else is largely unaffected.<br /><br />*My brother would argue that an upgrade from the original Xbox 360 to the S model is required to play any of the games, but he may have just had some bad luck.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

That's what I always did.<br />If you are extremely greedy/poor, you might even consider buying an used original console some years after the revised console is released, it will sell for a very cheap price.<br />I don't see the problem.
