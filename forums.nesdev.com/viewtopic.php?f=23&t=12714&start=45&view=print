Back when I got started with NES development people didn't even define the header in the source code, they just merged a 16-byte binary file created in an hex editor with the ROM after assembly.<br /><br />Now it's more common to define the header in the source code, but the assembler doesn't really know what that data is, it just puts the bytes you tell it to in the beginning of the file.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">yet asm6 is compatible with anything 6502.</div><br />Yes.<br /><br />From what I understand, ASM6 will start outputting data to the file as soon as it finds commands that generate output, and the first .ORG or .BASE will set the program counter so that the addresses of labels can be calculated. Subsequent .ORGs will output filler bytes until the specified address is reached, since the current address is known. Subsequent .BASEs will simply redefine the PC, without generating output, which is useful for creating new banks, because you want to continue appending data to the file but the PC has to be changed back to what it should be at the beginning of a bank.<br /><br />If you're unsure about how to generate ROMs with a certain structure, let me know exactly what you're trying to do and I'll see if I can help. Are you targeting a mapper other than NROM? What exactly isn't working as you expected?
