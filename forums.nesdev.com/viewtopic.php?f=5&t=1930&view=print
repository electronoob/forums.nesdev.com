<br />
<br />I live with a few distracting/annoying family members, so I know how it is.  In our case, the living room AC doesn't always get run when it needs to be because it's "too noisy".
<br />
<br />My biggest distraction though is being talked to, especially about things I really don't care at all about but don't want to be outright rude and actually say I don't care.  It's surely a bad habit, but I think I've gotten to the point where I focus so much on what I'm doing (when possible) that I just totally ignore the talking and pretend to acknowledge that I heard'em till they're done.  But then I get yelled at for forgetting important things.  lol
<br />
<br />There's always times when something is frustrating to work on though, and those are the times when distracting people are especially annoying, to the point I'll just give up for the time being.  
<br />
<br />But 85cocoa is right, sometimes headphones can be useful.  I even tried one of them white/pink/environment/etc noise generator programs before.  It's probably less distracting than music.

I can't think about anything technical if I'm dripping with sweat. My mother, on the other hand, opens her freaking windows at night to let that nice hot humid fresh air in. BTW, fans produce almost nothing but heat, so any fans not blowing directly on a person are just adding to the problem (also blowing air over the walls/ceiling, increasing heat transfer from the outside). Man, if I had to listen to TV/talk radio/music lyrics all day, I'd smash the damn things. Despite what parents constantly say, they don't care about their offspring and constantly do things to inhibit development (look up Alice Miller's works).
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Might some carefully chosen music (on headphones) help?</div><br />Headphones when one is sweating?!? Only adds to the claustrophobic feeling (for me, anyway).<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'll assume you can't run the air conditioner to save on electricity costs.</div><br />I calculated the A/C in my apartment to use about 1500 watts when running, which is about the same as a portable space heater. I was surprised how little this was, especially in comparison to the central heater, which used about six times as much power when running. I haven't researched window units, but those can be used to limit the area cooled. Perhaps you could find one and work out payment for the electricity it uses (watts * duty cycle).<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You should expose your concerns over this matter here.</div>
<br />Most living in Africa have been living in the climate all their lives so are used to it, and they probably don't experience the stresses that one does in a place where there is air conditioning. BTW, does anyone see why linking to words like "here" fails, because it significantly alters the sentence when it's stripped of links?
<br />
<br />One thing I'd recommend is to express your frustration etc. about the situation in however much detail you can (p/e-mail and I'll happily listen).

What I do is sleep during that time, and then I code all night long, when it's cooler and completely silent.
<br />
<br />I can sleep fairly easily, so most things do not bother me at all. I know not everybody is like this. Also, you can't do that all the time, it all depends on your other activities such as work and school, but you usually can fit a few hours of sleep during the day so that you can dedicate those hours to coding later at night.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I have distractions, a lot of them. I have a very strange living situation... I live in a resort that my dad manages, and my mother, father, and I all work there. I will be coding, and then all of the sudden, my mom tells me that I need to go make beds, and do laundry, and it can be annoying to have to do those things in the middle of coding. I also have an air conditioning unit right behind my chair, and it blows freezing cold air right at me, and it's distracting. I usually think through coding alot before I do it, that way, I won't have to be sitting there thinking things through for a long time, and I won't have as many distractions. Making an RPG engine with many distractions is REALLY irritating sometimes... Especially when there are STUPID unexplainable errors in your code that cause random bad things to happen. It makes me want to melt.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm surprised most guys have AC at home. This is an quite important waste of electricity, and it contribute to heat the planet more, even if it looks like it cools. I think using AC should be reserved for really important uses. Use it at home is a real waste.
<br />I live more on less in the mountains, so it may be cooler here than anywhere else in the world. When it is about 34°C outside, I close all windows and shutters to keep the room at 26°C and I can live with it. If it goes really too hot during vacation or I go in the underground room where there is also a PC and the temperature here never surpasses 20°C, even if it is 34°C outiside.
<br />I'm really not bothered by heat when I'm at home, I'm rather bothered by heat outside of my home.
<br />My worst distraction ? Usually I just code in weekend or vacation days, during the afternoon or so. My worst distraction is my own wish to play various games and not-wish to work, I think.
<br />About noise, I have no problems, exept maybe a jerk negitboor dog barking all the day.
<br />Also there is always my mom and my dad telling me I'm too much on my PC, and always chosing the worst time to annoy me with that. After that, of course, the worst "distraction" is scool, that I'm fortunatly in vacation now, but it will start agin soon. I really DO hate scool.
