I just want to say there is certainly an audience for SNES action games. There were plenty of them that are held in high status.

For games within the genre, Contra III and Super Turrican are held very highly.  Almost all SNES fans are familiar with these and the former is easily a personal favourite.  On hard mode, it's quite challenging and requires decent precision to get through unharmed.  Those are just two popular ones (in the platform shooter category), SNES fans are in no way strangers to action games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3295">smkd</a> — Fri Jun 04, 2010 4:06 am</p><hr />

If somebody upset you because they trust a magazine over you, that's not our concern.

I suppose it could be refuted by another user who claims they're the president's limo driver.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3438">UncleSporky</a> — Wed Jun 02, 2010 7:39 pm</p><hr />
