All it does is turn the rendering display on and off.<br /><br />The vblank PPU update most likely ends with a pair of two writes to $2005 to set the scroll. Maybe look for that, and put the CLI after it.

That is the only thing running while the screen is gray.<br /><br />I do a breakpoint by the CLI I set, the CLI gets noticed, the I flag is removed, then it will load the following opcode after itself, then at this point the IRQ pointer is loaded so I'm now within the IRQ, the I flag is set, and when I step into each command and reach the RTI, it goes back to the beginning of the irq routine, it just loops over and over.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The RTI does not necessarily clear the interrupt flag, it merely restores the flag to its state before the NMI started. If you don't CLI in your reset vector code, interrupts will still be inhibited when the NMI completes. You don't want this. Put that CLI back.<br /><br />If when you reach a CLI we immediately jump to your IRQ vector, this means that you had an unacknowledged IRQ pending. This is why I told you to acknowledge and enable the IRQ device right before you CLI in your NMI so there won't be a pending IRQ. (You should disable the IRQ device before the CLI in your reset code, though.)<br /><br /><br />What I might recommend at this point, though, is to create your own test ROM with entirely your own code to learn how the IRQ works. It's much easier to try things out and experiment in a from-scratch project than it is in a romhack. Once you know your way around a working NES program, even a small test program, this experience will help you a lot in finding your way around a romhack.<br /><br />I'm suggesting this because right now you seem to be asking a lot of questions that you could answer on your own if you weren't trying to do a romhack at the same time. I'm at arms length from whatever you're doing, so me telling you what to do bit by bit is a very slow and laborious way to try to get through this.

BUT, the game wont boot....? It again gets stuck within the irq routine at bootup. If I insert the CLI after the two writes to $2005's once the game has booted, it's fine. Same thing goes for in-game play, if I insert it then, its fine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, don't insert CLIs in random places, any previous advice about this was given on less complete information. I will tell you the specific things to do here. Get rid of any existing code that attempts to do things with the IRQ and do the following:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; 1.<br />; this goes in the reset-vector code, just before the infinite loop jumping to itself<br />;<br />lda #0<br />sta $5204 ; disable scanline IRQ<br />cli ; allow IRQs to fire outside of NMI routine (in case your NMI exits early)<br />; infinite loop here<br /><br />; 2.<br />; this goes in the NMI vector routine, put it near the beginning after the registers are pushed<br />;<br />lda #$3F<br />sta $5203 ; set scanline of IRQ to $3F<br />lda $5204 ; acknowledge and clear any pending IRQ<br />lda #$80<br />sta $5204 ; enable scanline IRQ<br />cli ; allow pending IRQs to trigger IRQ vector routine while NMI is still running<br /><br />; 3.<br />; this is your new IRQ vector routine, replace the entire irq vector routine with this.<br />;<br />pha<br />txa<br />pha<br />pya<br />pha<br />lda $2002 ; reset latch<br />ldy #$04<br />lda #0<br />sty $2006 ; sets nametable select to $2400<br />sta $2005 ; set scroll position within nametable to 0,0<br />sta $2005<br />sta $2006<br />lda $5204 ; acknowledge pending IRQ<br />lda #0<br />sta $5204 ; disable IRQ so that it cannot fire again this frame<br />pla<br />tay<br />pla<br />tax<br />pla<br />rti ; return from interrupt</div><br /><br />1. This code enables IRQs (CLI) outside the NMI, this is important in case your NMI routine reaches RTI before your IRQ needs to fire. Note that it also disables the MMC5 IRQ device so there is no chance of a pending IRQ that will immediately fire when you CLI.<br /><br />2. This initializes the MMC5 IRQ and sets it to fire at scanline $3F. The CLI enables interrupts for the remainder of the NMI routine.<br /><br />3. This does a scroll split at the time the IRQ is fired. After doing this, the pending IRQ is acknowledged, and the MMC5 IRQ is disabled so that it cannot fire again this frame. Unless you want multiple scroll splits there is zero reason to leave the MMC5 IRQ enabled at this point.<br /><br />I don't really like writing code for you to solve your problem. I would much rather help you learn how to do it, but I am hoping that this example at least helps you understand. (Again, you will learn a lot more easily if you stop trying to do advanced techniques in a romhack first, and instead write for yourself simple test ROMs.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The routine that I discovered works a better when projectiles are thrown, I experience no flickering/shaking with the irq. However with your routine, I get that slightly with projectiles. I went to the same screen id with the same enemies, and tested both routines, and those are the results I got.<br /><br />I don't want you thinking you spoon fed with me with the answer you pasted. When you told me there must be something up with the irq routine, I looked at hard, and realized I never had that interrupt setup properly by pushing/pulling. Also, I added PHP &amp; PLP to the irq routine, and that seems to really do the trick. I learned a lot from you and everyone else in this thread, dealing with this irq issue I've been having. I believe I now understand how to get this fully working from the ground up. I'm still experiencing the game not booting with that CLI within the two STA $2005's. But this could be just the way the game was originaly written, and since what I need is not needed throughout the entire game, I just need it for maybe 2 screens, I should be in the clear. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
