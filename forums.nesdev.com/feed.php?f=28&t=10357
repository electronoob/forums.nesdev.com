But developing a mapper of this nature isn't a simple task, I'd expect someone interesting in doing something like that to want to take off the arduino training wheels and develop for the raw atmega.  I'm not very savvy in the arduino ways, but as I understand the idea of cycle counting and writing assembly for time critical operations is beyond the scope of most arduino users.<br /></div><br /><br />I think I have you schematics that you posted a one point (but could've been the Kazzo), just need to load the CAD package that you use, only have Eagle installed ATM.<br />  You're right in that trying to run C or C++ on a 8 bit mcu has lots of limits, but Arduino code isn't much worse than AVR C. In line assembly is allowed but few people use it, true. With a cart specific lib to handle the NES interface, a developer could get about their project a little quicker.<br />  The advantage is the abundance of code examples with the Arduino; finding AVR assembly examples would be difficult in comparison. So getting a project off the ground would be faster, but more limited; although at almost 16 MIPS the hit isn't to bad. And sharing the note processing on the 2A03 helps as well. There are tons of midi related projects that are pure Arduino so performance wise it's not TOO bad.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />That and the arduino requires a separate mcu just to program the thing, where V-usb only needs a set of diodes and some resistors.<br /></div><br /><br />  Well, yes and no.

AFAIK once the code is on the mcu and up and running it really isn't an arduino anymore, it's just a standard avr.  Arduino is the IDE and means of getting your compiled code onto the avr.  If someone knew what they were doing I'm pretty sure they could take a synth developed on an arduino and get it up and running on this board just as long as they didn't rely on the TTL serial port while operating.  Either that or just convert it to the arduino means of programming yourself.<br /></div><br />  Well, the xtal (don't know what clock speed you are planning on), bootloader and the HW UART with a CTS/RTS controlled reset are really the only 'Arduino' specific elements, so lets say closer to 98% <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br />  I'm not an expert on the Arduino firmware's internals, but I think there are runtime accessible communication routines the IDE expects to be there, so it's a little more than just a boot loader AFAIK.

Well the project isn't intended to be a mapper development tool, the intent is for me to design the mapper and supply it for game development.  That said, I'd be more than willing to help someone who wanted to develop their own mapper using the board by providing pinouts and schematics and such.  But developing a mapper of this nature isn't a simple task, I'd expect someone interesting in doing something like that to want to take off the arduino training wheels and develop for the raw atmega.  I'm not very savvy in the arduino ways, but as I understand the idea of cycle counting and writing assembly for time critical operations is beyond the scope of most arduino users.<br /><br />That and the arduino requires a separate mcu just to program the thing, where V-usb only needs a set of diodes and some resistors.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Sorry if I seem to be harping on the whole Arduino thing. There is just so much development  going on with Arduino synth projects it's hard to ignore, seeing as you are at 95% Arduino compatible with your design.<br /></div>What part is incompatible?  AFAIK once the code is on the mcu and up and running it really isn't an arduino anymore, it's just a standard avr.  Arduino is the IDE and means of getting your compiled code onto the avr.  If someone knew what they were doing I'm pretty sure they could take a synth developed on an arduino and get it up and running on this board just as long as they didn't rely on the TTL serial port while operating.  Either that or just convert it to the arduino means of programming yourself.<br /><br />Tell ya what.
