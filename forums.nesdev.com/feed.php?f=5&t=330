But I'm sure it will work on the original console (I was talking with the autor Eric Pena, and he said he used a crappy polystation for the tests)  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />I'm sure if you drop a line to Eric, he'll help you as much as he can. And if you want my 'board design', I'll be very happy in send to you.<br /><br />Importing an EPROM burner in Brazil will be cost prohibitive. So, I'm searching for a DIY project. I just found this now:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.linuxdocs.org/HOWTOs/Diskless-HOWTO-6.htmlM">http://www.linuxdocs.org/HOWTOs/Diskless-HOWTO-6.htmlM</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Yes, I know the willem project already. Thanks!  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />My boards vary from an 8 game multicart, an UNROM, a CNROM and NROM (I think). They're 72-pin. Very simple design, and using common EPROMS. I was very envolved in this stuff a year ago, and now I need to read a lot, in order to familiarize again)<br /><br />There's any lockout chips in the cart boards. The dual console has no limitations, but it rejects only one type or 60 pin cart, just these polystations crappy 'black wax' yellow carts. Dunno why (I'm sure the carts are alright, though)<br /><br />Of course, I could put some scans, if you're interested. But I'm crappy at corel draw, and since I don't have webcan and scanner, it can delay some time.   <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /> <br /><br />But I'm here to contribute, as much as I can.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=136">NES virus</a> — Thu Jun 02, 2005 12:01 pm</p><hr />

Hi everyone!<br /><br />I'm new to this forum (altough a very frequent visitor), and hope to contribute in some manner to this awesome discussion.<br /><br />The NES is my all time favourite console, and I'd like to put some ROMS on homebrew carts, and I have all the information needed thanks to this forum. And I'm doing this the rough way: I don't want to mess original carts, so I'll make my own game boards. I have some pirate carts, and the design is really easy to follow.<br /><br />My only problem at this moment is the EPROM burnning, but I'm searching for some projects (I have cool ones, but the parts are a little difficult to find in my country  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> )<br /><br />Besides, I'm an electronics freak, and love to make some homebrew projects too. My last attemp was this NES arkanoid controller at:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://es.geocities.com/gamemasterquilpue/NES_ARKANOID_CONTROLLER.htm">http://es.geocities.com/gamemasterquilp ... ROLLER.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I think you should put this link at the 'hardware projects' section of NESDEV.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Cheers<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=136">NES virus</a> — Thu Jun 02, 2005 5:35 am</p><hr />
