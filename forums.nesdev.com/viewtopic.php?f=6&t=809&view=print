<br />I must say I'm strongly opposed to both ideas.  An emulator's job is to emulate the hardware.  It's hard enough to do the real job properly.. even without having to worry with all this "made-up" functionality.

<br />I mean if you're just going to bypass all the NES hardware limitations and use modern PC media... why are you even bothering with the NES at all?  Why not work on PC games?

<br />My emulator will do what *I* want it to do.  I want it to enhance games so that they're more enjoyable, without rewriting them.  Why are you so bitchy about it, you don't have to add it to your "emulator".

<br />
<br />Anyway, since it seems like you're triggering this through read/writes... just be sure to designate an unused area so it doesn't conflict with mapper register writes or NES system registers.  Unfortunately, mappers are known to occupy most of the available space (N106 takes all of $4800-FFFF)
<br />
<br />I think your best best would be around $46xx... I don't think anything uses that area, and it doesn't mirror to anything either.

<br />Because many of them would be making ROM hacks for proprietary NES games without having the original games' commented source code, which would be required for a proper PC port. Besides, some people develop NES games, Super NES games, or GBA games because they prefer limited-color 2D graphics to the truecolor 3D graphics that are expected of most PC games. If I want to make a 2D game, critics like to tell me to develop only for a platform that doesn't support 3D so that my work will be more appreciated.
<br />
<br /><strong>For graphics:</strong>
<br />Let's see... If you're working on upgrading an NES game to a more PC level, I'd suggest making tiles 16x16 pixels and 16 colors, with color 0 as transparent (as before). Then, given that each of the 8 palettes in the NES is 3 colors, and each color is 6 bits, associate these 18 bits with a 16-color palette using a hash table.
<br />
<br />It won't easily work with U*ROM games or A*ROM games or SNROM games or any other game with VRAM unless you hash the tile data itself, and that can get slow.
<br />
<br /><strong>For sound:</strong>
<br />CPU$3000-$3FFF might be a good place to put emulator-specific registers. This would act "normally" (that is, as a mirror of $2000-$2007) until the program unlocks it by writing a sequence of bytes to $3000 with the "slave PPU" bit set (which no commercial games use).
<br />
<br />But in more of the spirit of emulating hardware that could actually be implemented, this could be designed as a Famicom sound chip, which would occupy a 256-byte area outside what other mappers use. Games would need to be trained (e.g. IPS) to use the extra sounds, and it would need a separate sample bank (.wav, .ogg, etc) which could be included in a zipfile (MAME style) or in a folder or even as a new chunk type in UNIF or iNES+UNIF.
<br />
<br />$43x0 write: Control (enable, looping)
<br />$43x1 read: Status (finished, stopped, etc)
<br />$43x2-3 write: Sample number to play when this sample finishes
<br />$43x4-5 Playback rate
<br />$43x6 Left channel volume
<br />$43x7 Right channel volume
<br />$43x8-$43xF Reserved

<br />
<br />So you intentionally choose a system that has more restraints... but then do a hack-job to remove the restraints?  What?  Why did you pick the NES/SNES/whatever in the first place if you're just going to look for ways to get around the limits of the system?
<br />
<br />
<br />I dunno... the way I see it, is if you're working with the NES... you should be working with the NES.  I mean any halfass hacker can come along and make his own super-powered mapper that will only work in X emu (but won't work on the real thing because the mapper is fictional)... but that defeats the whole idea behind emulation.
<br />
<br />I mean I guess it's something this guy wants to do... and it's something he'll use, so I shouldn't be all negative like this.  But just the idea of this really makes me cringe.

<br />
<br />Based on my experience with the CHR caching optimization I described a while back, replacing tiles at run-time would not be a performance problem at all. The CHR caching routine does a fair amount of transformation on the tile data, and uses less than 1% of emulation time. Replacing it with a simple hash and selection of replacement tile data would probably make it faster.

I thought about that before.  It would possibly work with a controller port to RS232 adapter also, but controller reads can mess it up (from toggling the strobe output shared by both ports).
<br />
<br />If you want the sound coming out of the actual NES, then of course that's something else (and the system would need to be modified).  I'm not sure what you have in mind as far as what hardware would generate the sound.
