I've looked all around this topic since I started this thread.  Honestly, injection molding, DIY style can be done (there are a few books out there that talk about it), but when you get down to it: its not entirely practical for large objects or things that you don't plan on mass producing.  Features commonly found on injection molds include:<br /><br />- minimum 5% draft on all form elements so they don't stick<br />- active cooling of the mold so plastic cools before it leaves the mold<br />- ejection pins so molded elements can be freed from the mold easily<br />- injectors that use *friction*, as well as active heating, to melt plastic<br />- Edit: materials like ABS shrink after cooling *and* change color somewhat<br /><br />So in short: its voodoo.<br /><br />The most practical thing I've seen for doing this in your garage, barring the purchase of expensive equipment (as mentioned above), is this stuff:<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.alumilite.com/" class="postlink">http://www.alumilite.com/</a></span><br /><br />The cost of materials will dominate over large production runs, but for small quanties (not to mention prototype development), it would be ideal.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />Here's the rest of my bookmarks:<br /><br />Injection Mold Design:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.aesolutions.net/design_guidelines_for_quality_injection_molded_components.htm">http://www.aesolutions.net/design_guide ... onents.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rtpcompany.com/info/molding/">http://www.rtpcompany.com/info/molding/</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.protomold.com/designguidelines/">http://www.protomold.com/designguidelines/</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.dsm.com/en_US/html/dep/generaldesignguidelines.htm">http://www.dsm.com/en_US/html/dep/gener ... elines.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.engineersedge.com/injection_molding,.htm">http://www.engineersedge.com/injection_molding,.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.efunda.com/designstandards/plastic_design/plastic_intro.cfm">http://www.efunda.com/designstandards/p ... _intro.cfm</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.lindsaybks.com/dgjp/djgbk/inject/">http://www.lindsaybks.com/dgjp/djgbk/inject/</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.injection-molding-resource.org/">http://www.injection-molding-resource.org/</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.immnet.com/search/">http://www.immnet.com/search/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Google: "injection molding design guidelines" for the above and others<br /><br />Cold Casting (resin):<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://smooth-on.com/">http://smooth-on.com/</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/6985/casting.htm">http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/6985/casting.htm</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=273">pragma</a> — Tue Feb 14, 2006 6:20 am</p><hr />

That jives with what I've been reading lately; I haven't stopped researching all this since I first posted here.  Injectors are expensive, and the actual mold takes a huge amount of know-how and time to develop: a lot like software, really.   If I were to go that route, I'd likely have to work with a wood mold or something I can fine-tune before settling on a more permanent prototype.<br /><br />If I had unlimited access to a CNC machine, this would be a lot easier. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Thanks to your input, and that of others, I'm actually going to try some casts with rubber molds and resin.

a word of caution: just because patents expire doesnt mean they arent still protected.<br /><br />one of the biggest things you have to watch when making your own carts is the bevel on the underside of the NES cart. you cant just make a bevel like on nintendo's carts.... you either have to make the cartridge thinner with curved corners so that it will move up into the connector above the bevels.... or just use a 90 degree angle in place of the bevels.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25">WhoaMan</a> — Thu Jan 05, 2006 11:39 pm</p><hr />

It would be great to have get some new cases.  Isn't the expensive part of injection molding having the actual mold made?  And of course that you'd need to have a lot of cases made with it to make up for whatever other fixed costs there are.<br /><br />For lockout chips, we could have a seperate connector for it on the cart maybe.  Could even be detachable.  On the next board I prototype I'm gonna try using the gloptop CICs from Mario/Duckhunt through it's edge connector.  It's just 6 pins.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Jan 05, 2006 7:26 pm</p><hr />

What I did to my frontloaders is I just took this little scratcher/poker thing that came with my soldering iron, and I just pulled pin 4 right out of the chip itself. I didn't just bend the pin up out of the board, I pulled the pin out of the chip. I don't know too much about legalty of NESdev in general, or about the legalty of the redesigned famicom, but I totally own a Yobo FC console that my brother bought for me, and I'll be using this for dev testing, because it's lockout free. I think, at least. Their real cheap to buy, only $30 dollars for mine. They also work VERY well. Not compatible with CV3 at all. Weird graphical glitches.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Thu Jan 05, 2006 5:17 pm</p><hr />
