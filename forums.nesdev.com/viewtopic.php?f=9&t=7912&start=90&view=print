It would also allow for the board to be smaller.  Even the connectors price is cut in half with quantities in the 100's.  I would guess it could be made for a cost of around $15 if a couple hundred were made and sell for $20-30.  But I'm just throwing numbers out there.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">SkinnyV wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What would be cool would be to add support for sega genesis and snes, at a later point in the future of course. Then it would be a kick ass alternative to the retrode. Correct me if I'm wrong but dumping support for snes (with exception of special chip like sa-1, sdd-1, cx4 and the like) or genesis cart wouldn't be too complicated for a device like the Kazzo. I mean, the hard part is already done for dumping nes cart and I'm sure people will start sharing custom dumping script for unsupported mapper once it get shipped out so new console support could be something cool to hope for in the future imo.</div>
<br />
<br />I don't know a lot about SNES/Sega, but I think it would almost be simpler than the NES.  The main reason being the mappers, from what I under stand that's why the retrode doesn't attempt NES.  
<br />
<br />By quick glance SNES only has 24 address lines, 16 Data, and 14 some control signals.  Sega's about the same.  So the kazzo could easily be adapted to connect up even if you sucked up 16 pins for the data bus.  You could just I/O extend with a few more D-flipflops for the high address lines and uncommon control signals similar to what's done with the Kazzo.

<br />I slapped one together and am going through trying to test everything out before I send em off.  Even after triple checking everything a mistake still got through...  I swapped up the D+ and D- pins on the AVR <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  Good news is it's an easy fix.  I fixed the one by cutting the two traces and making the two connections manually that are only about 1/4" and 1/8" long.  The other tricky way is to solder the two resistors in funky.  Basically they were intented to be parallel to eachother, but really the board is wired up to have them criss-cross each other or they could wrap around one another.  Either way there is still room and clearance for the AVR above.
<br />
<br />For the guys getting kits just let me know what you'd like to do.  I'll do whatever you'd like.  I'll even solder in the affected components however you prefer if you feel uncomfortable about it.  Just let me know.
<br />
<br />EDIT: oh and the FC 60 pin connector works great too.

<br />
<br />Yeah I'm still happy with how they turned out, I guess these could be considered "limited edition"  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  It's also convenient that they are under the AVR so you actually can't even see the error and it's fix if you do the resistor cross or wrap around fix.
<br />
<br />That's kinda a tough question to answer.  The scripts would seem to be fairly simple for someone thoroughly knowledgeable with the NES and the mapper under question.  I found the NROM mapper script online and have since become a little more familiar with the scripts with that I was able to modify the UNROM script to UOROM but that was a super simple change.  The only script missing to allow dumping for the most common mappers is MMC1.  There is a SLROM script but nothing for SEROM of the other common boards.  I'm sure it would be an easy adaptation to make scripts for the other boards but I haven't spent any time with it yet.
<br />
<br />This is probably the best site to help explain the scripts (google translated), other than that I referred to the source code when I played around with the flash scripts.
<br /><a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Funagi.sourceforge.jp%2Fcgi-bin%2Fhiki%2Fhiki.cgi%3Fhow%2Bto%2Bdescribe%2Bmapper%2Bscripts" class="postlink">http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Funagi.sourceforge.jp%2Fcgi-bin%2Fhiki%2Fhiki.cgi%3Fhow%2Bto%2Bdescribe%2Bmapper%2Bscripts</a>
<br />
<br />Here is my uorom.ad script all I had to do was change the cpu rom size of the UNROM.ad.  But I think there is another way to do it by denoting 2x size of the UNROM script.

<br />OldNESJunkie and Tepples yours will ship on Tuesday.
<br />
<br />A note on the bootloader:  So I actually was able to corrupt the bootloader sector the other day playing around with the bootloader software.  It resulted in needing to reload the bootloader firmware with an AVR programmer.  Not a great situation if you don't have one, but I would be happy to help out reloading it for someone who may have an issue.  
<br />
<br />I'm not certain but I think it happened as a result of not following the 3 steps in the HIDbootflash software.  First you connect to the device, then select .hex file to be loaded, and finish by flashing the AVR.  I was being a little sloppy and disconnected before flashing.  So when I reconnected the software still was in the connected state and let me try to flash even though I should have reconnected.  The flash failed and then I couldn't reconnect no matter what I did.
<br />
<br />It shouldn't really be an issue especially if you never play around with the bootloader and it's software.  But just be aware if you do, to flow the proper steps if in doubt just reconnect before trying to flash.  But aside from that one time I've swapped back and forth from the kazzo firmware and my own firmware dozens of times with ease.
<br />
<br />EDIT:  here's some pictures of all that's included with the kit (FC connector optional)

<br />Should work.  You'll have to add the library files to see the connector and a few other things.  I think I may have put the switches and other items in a different library though.  If its an issue let me know which components and I'll gather up those libraries as well for you.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just received my kit today and went straight to assemble it. Only problem I had was I soldered the cap without thinking it needed to be layed flat since the MCU is right on top:) I hope it didnt break because I had already cutted the excess pin so It was a challenge to get it to lay flat with the little ammount of pin lenght left. Oh well it would be trivial to go buy another cap in case of a problem anyway. I didn't had the time to really test it past installing the driver and using the test executable coming with the software package and even then I'm not sure if it told me it was find or not. Only thing is the led doesn't light up. I'm pretty sure I soldered it the right way though. Is it supposed to light when the switch is set to ON or to show transfer activity?
