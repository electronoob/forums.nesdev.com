I'm still a huge fan of Ulead PhotoImpact, which is basically abandoned by current owner Corel, and hard to buy, except for that $10 ancient version of PhotoImpact 5 on Amazon.  Except it's not open source by any means and doesn't belong in this thread.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Sun Aug 08, 2010 4:08 pm</p><hr />

For the archiving the windows version of 7zip is a great replacement for winRAR. Does all the major formats plus it does not thave the nag screen(I know it can be removed but that can be quite hardd for some if they don't feel like dishing the money out). For GNU/Linux I use pz7zip-full(I think that is what its called and fileroller(plus the unfree unrar for passworded rars).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4169">danntor</a> — Sun Aug 08, 2010 3:24 pm</p><hr />
