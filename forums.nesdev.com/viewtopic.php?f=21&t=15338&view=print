Not perfect, but also not a terrible waste of time for something you'll not be doing all the time.<br /><br />If I could suggest an improvement, it would be to get into the technical aspect of these tricks, maybe even include some visual aids so that even those who aren't familiar with the system's architecture can appreciate the effort put into creating those effects. That'd be a significant amount of work, but maybe we can collaborate.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Isn't this all either swapping out a few tiles to make it look like there's another background layer or changing scroll registers per scanline, coupled with sprites to hide horizontal splits on a few of these? Of course, I say this as if it were easy, and I know this is more difficult on the NES than the SNES or most anything else after it. The main thing that seems to limit what new thing you can show off is the lack of vram, and although some games like Battletoads have ram for tile data, I heard there's not enough time to update a substantial part of it outside the characters so you won't see anything like psychopathicteen's bullet demo. Elite is definitely impressive though (I'm assuming graphics are split into two bitplanes? I don't know how that much is being updated) and I don't know how Noah's Ark is doing the grayscale water effect, as I heard you can't swap colors midscreen on the NES. Recca is impressive on the CPU side for pushing that much crap.

Notice how the right side is very detailed, but the left side is just repetitive horizontal patterns. Scrolling is used to move the right part, while only the edges of the left part are redrawn to negate the scrolling. The spikes are sprites. The far background is also very repetitive, it's only 8 pixels wide, but since the platforms move 4 pixels at a time or the movement would look too rough, they bankswitch the background to a version that's offset by 4 pixels, so that it looks stationary even when the platforms move.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">https://youtu.be/dWHPNnrTmKs?t=42m21s</div><br />This is very similar to an effect in Battletoads. Only the ends of the snake are updated in the name tables as it moves, while the illusion of movement is created by bankswitching the patterns of the body.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">https://youtu.be/dWHPNnrTmKs?t=43m1s</div><br />The huge beams are drawn on the background.

Noah's Ark is simply turning on the monochrome bit along with the blue emphasis bit though, which isn't tricky at all. You just need a timer to know *when* to make this change.

I like the look of horizontal splits a lot more, but I think it looks best when both are combined. It would be really cool to see a more elaborate version of swapping tiles to make it look like there's another tilemap in the background. Most of the time, it's just some ugly 16x16 pattern. Of course, this would make it impossible to use ram for the graphics and the cartridge would have to be that much more complex along with taking more memory. this also could only realistically work if the screen was moving along one axis, but most NES games do already. The 16x16 palette area is also a huge problem, but if you were to pull off something crazy like this, it's probably expected you'd use the MMC5.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">along with the blue emphasis bit though</div><br />It looks straight-up gray to me.
