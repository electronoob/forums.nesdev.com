(sorry about that)<br />• JRoatch's website labeled as such (I made one card first and copied and pasted into it as a template, so that's why it was labeled incorrectly.)<br />• Restructured references to remove indefinite article before &quot;NES&quot; (to avoid inner voice conflict when a/an precedes &quot;en ee es&quot; or &quot;ness/nezz&quot;). I didn't want inconsistency within the document, and it's <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1213413" class="postlink">a divisive enough topic</a> that I wouldn't want to make a call on it.<br />• Altered A53 write-up so as not to refer to both the games and volumes as &quot;entries&quot; in the same sentence.<br />• Fixed formatting and convention errors I made in: glutock, INL, and my own entries.<br />• Added glutock's Twitter handle, which I had forgotten to include.</ul><br /><strong>Additional Credits</strong><br />There's not room for everyone listed from every blurb.txt, but I did try to leave a credit for any musician or artist whose work was used in any of the entries, but I'm not sure if I got all of them. If your game featured music or artwork sourced from someone else or a collaborator not mentioned, please let me know so that I can include it.<br /><br />Images are now larger for easier reading:<br /><a href="http://files.mteegfx.com/a53v3_PosterBack_03.jpg" class="postlink">First Row</a><br /><a href="http://files.mteegfx.com/a53v3_PosterBack_05.jpg" class="postlink">Second Row</a><br /><a href="http://files.mteegfx.com/a53v3_PosterBack_06.jpg" class="postlink">Third Row</a><br /><a href="http://files.mteegfx.com/a53v3_PosterBack_07.jpg" class="postlink">Fourth Row</a><br /><a href="http://files.mteegfx.com/a53v3_PosterBack_08.jpg" class="postlink">Fifth Row</a><br /><br /><br />Oh, and tepples, I think the blue of your image looks fine, especially near the pink of your card.
