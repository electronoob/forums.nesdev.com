The YoBo famiclones are decent, but do not support MMC5 and have inverted duty cycles for the square waves. This makes music playback and sound effects noticeably different on certain games (TMNT for one is very noticeable).<br /><br />The entire PCB for the thing is just larger than the cartridge connector, and the slot is not a very tight fit. This results in hangs and resets when barely bumping the unit or pulling on the controller cable due to cart wiggle.<br /><br />The controllers included with the YoBo are actually decent for aftermarket controllers, but the button action wares out after only a few hours of play. Certainly use original controllers on this thing.<br /><br />These are $20 new in the US at retail stores. I've seen them for less than $12 shipped on E-Bay from Hong Kong to the US.<br /><br />While I wouldn't recommend a YoBo over an origional, it's certainly a workable solution if you don't care to spend that kind of cash on a legacy console. I can buy a used XBox 360 for the same price as a top-loader NES, so it's a no-brainer <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3706">qbradq</a> — Wed Jun 19, 2013 8:33 am</p><hr />

The Mega Man 6 PAL you saw might have been the NTSC version with the CIC (lockout chip) swapped with a PAL CIC. Then they just raise the price. It's possible they could even have made a fake Mega Man 6 PAL label. Mega Man 6 I think will run OK in PAL mode, but there will be no adjustments like what may have been made in the PAL versions of Mega Man 1 - 5. Generally they atleast adjust the tempo and pitch of the audio so it sounds correct. I have no idea if they alter the speed of anything in game to make it feel more like the original speed.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Mon Jun 17, 2013 11:58 am</p><hr />

Effects that modify the picture as it is rendered require the PPU to be intercepted at the precise moments where these changes should take place, so the CPU runs some dummy timed code to wait for such moments. Since the CPU/PPU speed ratio is different between PAL and NTSC consoles, code timed for one region will not work on the other.<br /><br />This difference (along with the different frame rate) also means that the amount of time the CPU has to run the program each frame is different between PAL and NTSC, which could affect anything really, including the music, depending on how the game is programmed.<br /><br />There are means to prevent most of these problems, and it's perfectly possible for a game to adapt itself to the console it's running on (many homebrew games do that), but most developers didn't code games that way.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Jun 16, 2013 11:39 pm</p><hr />

Mega Man 6 for PAL is not rare. It just doesn't exist at all. It was never released. You posted here previously and were told this. <br /><br />If you play Mega Man 6 on a PAL system be aware that the music will play back at a different than intended rate. Why haven't you considered getting it on Playstation 2 via the Mega Man Anniversary Collection? It would play better on there. I know you want &quot;original hardware&quot; but unfortunately you can't do that without a NTSC NES or Famicom system. Also, you don't need to cut up your Mega Man 4 cartridge. I don't know why you'd even consider doing that if a PAL Mega Man 4 is as rare as you say it is. <br /><br />There are brand new MMC3 PCBs available that support TGROM. There is no need for donors.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Sun Jun 16, 2013 7:56 am</p><hr />

Hi All, I live in Australia, and all Original Megaman cartridges are expensive as is the postage if your willing to pay it. I've been lucky for some time and managed to collect original MM2-MM4, could not bring myself to PAy $100 for MM5 so I made that, but for some reason can not get my hands on a PAL version of Megaman 6, this is very rare and if found can be ridiculously expensive to buy. I have now come to the reality if I want to play this on the original hardware, I either pay over $100 on ebay + postage for the original or piggyback a rom image onto Megaman 4, though it really grates me to damage my original Megaman 4 to be able to play MM6. My only ask, is does anyone know where I may find a Rom Image of MM6 that is is PAL, im almost contemplating flashing a NTSC image on a 4mbit flash and trying but I would rather not, if I can find a PAL image first. Does one exist anywhere? Or a reasonably priced original actually exist? I would rather own the original than use a Rom image also - you know drastic measures when your itching to play the real thing....<br />Another Question, does anyone know where I can get hold of the top of the outer shell of a top loader nes, I own a PAL version of a top loader, but many moons ago a soldering iron was dropped on the top of it and this sadly left an ugly impression on it, do spares of these exist?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3606">majekle</a> — Sun Jun 16, 2013 1:32 am</p><hr />
