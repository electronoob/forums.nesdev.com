<br />Are you 100% sure about hardware sprite shrinking? From what I have heard all such effects are just using the massive amounts of graphics rom available as some games have 64 MegaBytes dedicated just to graphics tiles.

<br />It is in spanish, but deserves taking a look.... Go to the bottom of the page and will see what an genesis amateur programmer has done: a static image with big fighters and a detailed background. Circled zones (in red) are those which should be repeated (i.e., use the same tile)  in order to save tiles on screen. The result is pretty good... using the whole tile memory: 1120 of them... (if you want an english translation, please ask)
<br />
<br />The next step will be animating it, and that's the point... Could it be possible to do a fluent animation?? If so, could it be possible to do software zooms??

<br />
<br /> It *really* depends on the game. But the designs of the home consoles at the time VS the Neo Geo hardware are just soo different. SNES uses a VRAM setup while the arcade system uses VROM and a huge address range (along with banking). Updating animating is no sweat for the Neo Geo. That's not particular true for the SNES, even though it has a fast local to vram DMA. If anything, with all the features of the SNES sPPU(s) - the system <em>should have</em> had 128k of vram. 64k is just too small. You can't double buffer much for large animation updates and nobody likes screen "tearing". VDMA is only something like 7k per vblank max (for 224/NTSC). You'd have to end the display early (shorten the number of viewable scanlines) to reclaim some more bandwidth (well, I assume this is doable). Corners are going to be cut somewhere...
<br />
<br /> The Neo Geo also has something like 8k for subpalettes. That's a godly amount. And I thought the PCE's 32 subpalettes was big.
<br />
<br /> Some one asked this very same question in another forum, but for Genesis. Near 1:1 (since the colors would be much less). If it was just more a matter of rom size than anything else. The answer's the same, depends on the game being ported <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Magno, any NeoGeo game could be ported to SNES or Genesis. If the developer wanted to do it, they could. But it would be alot of work (like redrawing the art for a smaller resolution similar to what Capcom did with their Arcade ports like Street Fighter 2) and might involve a prohibitive amount of ROM. And they certainly wouldn't be 1:1 ports. Neither SNES or Genesis will ever run 1:1 ports of NeoGeo games. There is a reason that NeoGeo cost something like $600 and SNES and Genesis cost under $200. 
<br />
<br />I'm not sure what you mean by SNES never being pushed to its limit. What exactly do you think is its limit? The SNES has pretty well defined "limits". When a game on SNES has slowdown, wouldn't that be pushing the processor to the limit because processing each frame is now taking so long that a new frame is not ready in time to maintain 60 frames per second? What about when too many sprites are on the same line and some disappear? Isn't that pushing it to the limit? I recall having that happen in Secret of Mana if you got enough people on the same horizontal line. How about Super FX or SA-1? Wouldn't that be pushing the limits even further by adding a new CPU? Or Clay Fighter with it's streaming samples to the SPC for the really cool intro theme? 
<br />
<br />I really don't understand what limit you imagine the SNES has. Perhaps you should research the SNES by looking up some documents on it. I don't think developers were that lazy, the SNES had lots of games that really used its capabilities to the fullest or damn close to it. It's not like there was alot of untapped potential in the SNES that no game ever used. 
<br />
<br />The things I see as limits to SNES games mainly are CPU processing power and memory which I think can be complaints on any system. Both can be added and were added to the SNES in various forms.

<br />
<br />That even occurs in Seiken Densetsu 3 intro, if you try to put a lot of chars in the same line because they are sprites... The intro DOESN'T push SNES to any limit, pretty simple intro but bad designed...
<br />
<br />There are a lot of games with flickering on some frames that could have benn better designed, because the image complexity wasn't that high. And the better example is the one you said: Secret of Mana... it flickers sometimes and the game is not very CPU nor PPU intensive.
<br />
<br />It's been some years (about <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /> reading SNES documentation carefully, so I know what I mean when I say that its hardware resources could have been better used.
<br />
<br />Programmes had to deal to ROM limitations, which could have been released the CPU of hard work and better effects and graphics could have been done. What about an Art of Fighting port of 96 megs for SNES? Yes, I know it would have been TOO expensive, but a 12 Megabyte file in your computer is not appreciable...

I don't mean to be negative but I don't believe you understand what you are talking about. Though maybe I'm not understanding what you mean exactly.
<br />
<br />I don't understand what you said here: "Programmes had to deal to ROM limitations, which could have been released the CPU of hard work and better effects and graphics could have been done."
<br />
<br />I honestly have no idea what you were saying here. ROM size and the CPU's workload don't really have much to do with eachother. Graphics and special effects weren't really effected by ROM size other than the total amount of tile data you could store. 
<br />
<br />This Art of Fighting idea of using 96 megabits of ROM doesn't really make sense either. Just giving the SNES more ROM doesn't fix the problem with a NeoGeo port. The SNES plain and simple CAN'T display the resolution the NeoGeo can. I believe the NeoGeo also can handle more colors on screen at once. Plus in general the NeoGeo uses massive amounts of graphical tiles at once that the SNES just won't handle. 
<br />
<br />As I said before, you could certainly port any NeoGeo game to SNES if you were the developer and had access to all the source code and assets and reworked them all for the SNES. All graphics and sound would have to be scaled down to work on the SNES. If you have more ROM available like 96 megabits you could probably have more animation frames assuming you have time to use DMA to update all the tiles you need to within VBlank time. 
<br />
<br />But there is no magic tricks you can do for the SNES to pull off a NeoGeo 1:1 port. It just isn't happening. If you want an example of what could be done you need to look at Super Street Fighter II on CPS2 and SNES. That is what could have been done.

<br />
<br />More ROM means that sprite scaling in Art of Fighting could have been done using different sized sprites, not using software scaling. And that's only ONE example. RAM could be used for some other porpouses if most graphics are transfered from ROM to VRAM.
<br />A 1:1 port is impossible, since resolution is different, and so colors are; but, imo, without ROM limitation and MAYBE some optimizations, better results could have been reached.
<br />
<br />I don't see you putting forth an example that proves your arguments, but anyway, I don't want to argue with somebody who seems to have something against me. I didn't attack you and somehow you look like offended...

<br />Not necessarily.  A lot of early SNES games had problems with slowdown that might not have existed if the coders had more experience working with the hardware.  Donkey Kong Country has less slowdown than Super Mario World, but wouldn't you say it better demonstrated the system's capabilities?
