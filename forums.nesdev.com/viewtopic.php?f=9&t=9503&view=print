Nobody is emulating anything, TheFox just reads the colors output somehow, and then Bunny probably processes the AV out and turns it in to HDMI out. Neither are changing the PPU chip with anything else. It's not an emulator. It will be accurate with everything, ever, as emulators will not be.

It listens to what the real PPU is doing, either by listening to the EXT bus or oversampling the VIDEO_OUT signal, and transforming that back into RGB. There is no chance of rendering inaccuracies¹. It would do the right thing on <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=6401" class="postlink">reads of 2007 during rendering</a>, and we didn't even have that behavior specified until 2⅔ years ago.<br /><br />¹<span style="font-size: 70%; line-height: normal"> Beyond those intrinsic to the colorspace transformation.</span>

If you draw the line at not using the normal PPU, any RGB PPU means you might as well use an xbox. The RGB PPU is not the correct device for running NES and Famicom games. Its colors are wrong. Certain colors are incompatible. Also certain games have art intended to be viewed as NTSC video and not RGB video as I recall. So it's pointless to get into some argument about this. <br /><br />Devices that can reconstruct the video signal into a higher quality signal without the issues that come with NTSC Composite Video is a good thing. As others stated the functionality of the NES and from the point of view of the software running is identical to if you had no device attached to the PPU at all. Afterall, you're just spying to recreate the video signal. You aren't interfering with the operation of the system.

It should be 100% compatible with anything that works &quot;correctly&quot;, but maybe not with glitch demos.<br />3) More the device emulates, whatever it is, more the accuracy suffers.

Even if there was some writes to 2007 or something messing with the palette, I don't think it would interrupt pixel generation.<br />Does changing color emphasis interrupt pixel generation?
