		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd like to collect the names of games that exist for NES and Game Boy that are basically identical as far as this is possible. You know, games that have the same look and feel on both consoles, even though the Game Boy screen is of course smaller.<br />I'm not talking about mere ports. They really have to feel alike. For example, &quot;Double Dragon&quot; not only has different graphics, but the gameplay is different as well. The movements work differently etc.<br />I'm talking about games that feel like the same code was used (even though this isn't true).<br /><br />Please only list games for the classic Game Boy.<br /><br />The games that I've found so far:<br /><br />Paperboy<br />Star Wars<br /><br />Do you know of any other games that are that similar?

The levels and order are slightly different between games. The level design is not very interesting though, so it hardly makes much of a difference.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Looks like there are a bunch of nearly-identical games.<br /><br />Yeah, &quot;Bug's Bunny's Crazy Castle&quot; isn't really what I was talking about. I didn't just mean games where the premise is the same. I was actually talking about identical graphics and identical gameplay (minus the screen difference). For example, Bugs Bunny walks quicker in the Game Boy game, so it's different physics.<br /><br />&quot;Gauntlet II&quot; was the one that I had in mind as well.<br /><br />And I think &quot;The Lion King&quot; could be identical.<br /><br />&quot;Duck Tales&quot; would have been the same if they had used the same level layout. The game mechanics seem to be identical.

It doesn't have to be the same from a point of view of the programmer, only of the player. If games are alike in the same way &quot;Paperboy&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Gauntlet II&quot; are, then they count.
