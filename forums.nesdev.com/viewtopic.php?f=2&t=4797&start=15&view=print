<br />But still, I prefer photoshop to do the drawing, painting, etc. Then export it as PNG with the exact amount of colors I want, then adjust color indexes in GraphicsGale.

<br />
<br />I remember messing around with it, I liked it a lot.  But by the time I realized how much would be involved with doing the data conversion, for my project at the time I was just be happier to make real progress by forming the data in a hex editor.  Then later I made my own half-assed map editor that runs on NES.  Plus I didn't know any languages besides assembly at the time.  The author didn't have the files for the NES data format converter anymore.
<br />
<br />Maybe it's not useful to you, but it may be worth checking out, in any event.

<br />
<br />I remember trying it and I don't remember why I didn't like it.   Maybe it's because of the data format or something like that.  Or was it because it's dos only? 
<br />
<br />I wanted now to give it a quick look to remember what is it because I can't remember anything about it compared to mappy or tile studio but the website is now down and cannot find the file anymore.
<br />
<br />If I can finish mine someday it will have features for the nes so I guess it will be a big plus.  Of course I would prefer not to waste time on making one and use an existing tile editor but none fitted my needs. So I try to see it as a learning experience.

<br />
<br />Deluxe paint.. The memories <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I remember using that and Deluxe animation 19 years ago on my first 286 PC while trying to make some games in quick basic 4.5.  I didn't know anything about programming at the time.
<br />
<br />I did another search and open tume is technically gone: everyone links to the same AOL web page that is now down.  So there is no way to download it anymore unless someone put a mirror somewhere.
<br />
<br />So I guess I will continue to make my editor.
