But I don't know why &quot;M&quot; and not &quot;DBE&quot;. Because &quot;M2&quot; acts same as MOS6502's &quot;DBE&quot;.

If I got it wrong, so tell ALL the others now that they're wrong too.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /> <br /><br />Even the CPU instuction timing brings integer numbers, of CPU cycles per instruction (like 3, 4, 5...).

At anyway, it's the simplest thing ever: if a instruction takes 3 cycles, we have even/odd/even cycles. Regarding the APU, yes, that's a good approach.

Data Bus Enable (DBE) is:<br /><div class="quotetitle">MOS Technologies/Commodore Semiconductor Group wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><strong>Data Bus Enable(DBE)</strong><br />This TTL compatible input allows external control of the tri-state data output buffers and will enable the microprocessor bus driver when in high state.  In normal operation DBE would be driven by the phase two (Phi2) clock, thus allowing data output from microprocessor only during Phi2.  During the read cycle, the data bus drivers are internally disabled, becoming essentially an open circuit.  To disable data bus drivers externally, DBE should be held low.</div><br /><br />The 651x line (not including the 6510) <em>did</em> have Phi1 and Phi2 inputs but still have a Phi2 output.

It's not like the 6502 has an internal cycle counter that starts at 0 [even] or 1 [odd] anyway, so it's silly to impart oddness or evenness on something only humans count.  I don't really care whether the DMA <span class="posthilit">drumbeat</span> starts with a read or a write, but my guess would be a read since if nothing's been read then writing would be useless.  I also showed in <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=9009&amp;hilit=+Visual2A03" class="postlink">this thread</a> that the APU DMC DMA, which is a single read, occurs in the read of the <span class="posthilit">read/write</span> DMA <span class="posthilit">drumbeat</span>, and that the write is replaced by a read, since writing the APU DMA sample to the PPU would not be appropriate.<br /><br />In the same vein it seems silly to refer to the different-length PPU frames as odd and even.  &quot;short&quot; and &quot;long&quot; perhaps.
