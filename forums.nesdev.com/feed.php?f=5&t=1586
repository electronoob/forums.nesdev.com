The players are very small, much smaller than any other fighting games. It kinda looks nice, but I'd like to see a good fighting game with large, detailed characters for once. A mapper with CHR switching would be needed though, as it would be impossible to keep all the graphics of big characters loaded at once or to use CHR-RAM and draw such large ammounts of tiles on the fly.<br /><br />EDIT: I've been playing with sprite sizes a bit, and came to the conclusion that the smalest size a fighting game character can be is 24x48 pixels. and even then the guy is a bit squashed within those dimensions (this is scaled by 2):<br /><br /><img src="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/fighter01.gif" alt="Image" /><br />I believe that anything less than that won't feel like a fighting game. The extra column to the right should be used when kicking and punching, but that may not be enough for certain moves. With this size, there would be no flickering for most of the time, but when both characters are attacking and some effects are showing, it will flicker a bit. Of course, this is with both characters as sprites, and a regular background behind them.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue May 30, 2006 9:15 am</p><hr />

I've been thinking about this for a while... The idea I talked about in the previous post (a sprite character and a background character) could be implemented like this:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/fighting01.gif" alt="Image" /><br />These are the 2 name tables, with horizontal mirroring. The bottom name table is dedicated to the background player (although the bottom part could be used for something else, but I coudn't thing of anything), so that it can be placed anywhere in the arena without problems (even when jumping).<br /><br />The arena could be static (256 pixels wide), it could loop, or the slightly glitchy horizontal mirroring side scrolling can be performed.<br /><br />A few mid-screen split would be needed. The health bars would be static at the top. The sky stripe would move or not, depending on the arena. It could even scroll at a different speed than the floor, for a 3D effect. Then it'd cut to the second name table, adjusted so that the character stays in the right place. Later, switch back to the floor wich may or may not scroll.<br /><br />Any effects such as energy blows, blood, hit flashes, etc. would be drawn with sprites. Some minor flicker would show, of course. Once I thought about using a few sprites to fake background details behind the players, but I guess it would only increase flickering.<br /><br />Sorry for the babbling, it's just that I like to think about those things... =)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue May 30, 2006 9:06 am</p><hr />

Using one-screen mirroring with one name table for the background and status bar and the other for one of the characters may be pratical.<br />The background in fighting games is mostly dummy (just here for ambiance), so basically having only BG on the top and the bottom of the fighting players would sure work well.<br />Punch Out does the player and arbitral with BG, while all opponants are in sprites.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue May 30, 2006 8:54 am</p><hr />

Of course, you'd have to sacrifice a huge chunk of the backgroung, maybe only using a stripe way on top of the screen (where no character can jump) and below the character's feet. If you are really clever, you can still set a mood for the level even though there is no background behind the players.<br /><br />The good part is that you could also use the background color to draw the characters, so you have 4 colors for them instead of 3. It may not seem like much, but I think it makes a hell of a difference.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue May 30, 2006 6:19 am</p><hr />

"Really bad" but Kart Fighter is better than Street Fighter 1, right?<br /><br />The Ninja Turtles game you refer to is <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Tournament Fighters</em>, and like <em>Kart Fighter</em>, it was plagued by flicker.<br /><br />I'm guessing that flicker can be mostly avoided in a homebrew fighting game by making each character roughly 32x64 pixels with 8x16 pixel sprites.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Tue May 30, 2006 6:08 am</p><hr />

i believe there was one called kart fighter or something like that. it featured super mario brothers characters. it was entertaining but the movement was too choppy. im not sure if it would be in the same class of pirates as the others, becuase other than the characters, i haven't seen a game that this was a clone of. well maybe super smash bros.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=187">never-obsolete</a> — Tue May 30, 2006 2:42 am</p><hr />

I know there are not many fighting games for the NES, mostly because of the sprite limitation I'd guess. But there are a few that I'm aware of:<br />- Joy Mecha Fight (I really like this one!);<br />- Datach Dragonball Z;<br />- Datach Yuu Yuu Hakusho;<br />- Some Ninja Turtles game;<br /><br />Does anyone know of any others? BTW, I'm not counting the endless pirate ones (Mortal Kombats, Street Fighters, Tekkens, etc), as they are badly programmed and barelly resemble an actual game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon May 29, 2006 10:48 pm</p><hr />
