Simple POR signal, which can be driven low by the cart as you said (but be sure to use open drain output).  If you're designing a cart, any chips with both active-high and active-low chip selects should have the active-high one (often named CE2 without a bar to indicate active-high, or else /RST with a bar, same thing) connected to this pin.

Most likely there is an internal pull-up on that pin which prevents the user from having to drive this pin (which saves space on the board) unless the user actually wants to be able to *disable* the memory.  If a pin has the *name* 'NC' it means that physical pin on the IC literally has no connection to the die within the package (i.e. there is no bond-wire). On the other hand, if you see &quot;NC&quot; in the description field of the pinout document it means that there is simply nothing connected to that pin on the PCB even though that pin does indeed connect to something on the die.

But maybe that's just an dead-end / test-point (I didn't dig deeper, and didn't check if the via goes anywhere).

At first, N had planned to ship the DSP-1 in every console instead of in every Pilotwings/Mario Kart Game Pak. The CPU would have had to generate an enable signal for that, just as it generates enables for the gamepads and the PPU ports. Perhaps one of the cut signals is an enable for a cut feature.

They (Argonaut) came up with the Super FX concept even before the system was launched. The DSP-1 was another one of those projects. NEITHER got included in the final console.<br /><br />Nor the backwards compatibility to the NES. (Different article). The SNES was quite a compromise.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Edit:</strong> rereading, I've been kind of misleading. The Super Famicom hardware was developed, for which tech demos were developed, and one of them involved a red biplane and an airport (with a simple angled rotating view from above), from which diverged DragonFly and Flight Club, which eventually merged back into Pilotwings. The Argonaut team was shown some form of Pilotwings after they demonstrated the 3D that they could do in software (like with X on the GameBoy). They said to get any better would involve having to make another chip.<br /><br />What was misleading is that the DSP-1 could have been in the SNES, but there was no way the Mario Chip (which became Super FX) would have been done in time for launch of the system.<br /><br />partial source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/16331">http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/16331</a><!-- m -->

And what bottom corner notes?<br />And do you mean dots/traces in the schematic, or on the actual mainboard?<br /><br />Okay, I've found U17... it's the 16bit stereo DAC. Pin5 and Pin12 are AGND (Analog GND).<br />That might work if only one AGND is connected, thought I'd expect that the mainboard has both pins connected. If there's a dead-end AGND trace on mainboard or in schematic then it might be meant to be some shielding. And dots/pads/vias without connection might be test points... or even relicts from earlier versions where nintendo planned to connect something to that pins.
