Hey koitsu<br /><br />Thanks for pointing out that bug.  It seems to be caused by the PHP &quot;compiler&quot; I used called &quot;PHPack&quot;.  The path mentioned does exist on my machine.

Yeah, this is a great tool, frantik.  I'd love to convert it into C (and I might just do that) sometime.

frantik, are you still maintaining disasm6? I made a few minor improvements to v1.4 and I'm including them in here as a patch file. All the changes have to do with handling transitions between code and data in the .cdl file. The changes are:<br /><br />1. If a location is marked as both code and data in the .cdl file, then it should be treated as code (right now it's treated as data). This can happen when writing PRG-ROM to setup the mappers. For example, the North American Tetris uses &quot;INC $8000&quot; to reset the MMC1 mapper, but location $8000 contains valid code as well.<br /><br />2. When something is decoded as hex data, disasm6 automatically reads 4 bytes at a time without checking ahead in the cdl to see if any bytes are marked as code. Once again in Tetris there are cases where a &quot;JSR&quot; is immediately followed by two data bytes which are a pointer for the subroutine to read. The subroutine then returns two bytes after the pointer, so the raw bytes in the .cdl file are: &quot;code code data data code code ...&quot;. Right now, disasm6 will decode all four &quot;data data code code&quot; bytes as if they were data only. The logic I added to handle this is in the same loop that already checks for a label somewhere in the middle of those 4 bytes which would correctly cause us to read less than 4 bytes for this line of output.<br /><br />3. When using one of the &quot;JumpTable&quot; or &quot;RTSTable&quot; labels, disasm6 starts to decode <em>all</em> data as table pointers until it encounters some user defined label. With my patch, the first byte marked as code will also end the decoding of the table. Otherwise, for each jump/RTS table you would need to manually add a dummy label to stop decoding any further.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6334">ThVortex</a> — Tue Jan 28, 2014 7:40 pm</p><hr />

the illegal opcodes are usually data. but the program assumes everything is code unless you specifically tell it what is code and what is data, using a code/data log (CDL)<br /><br />A CDL can be generated using most branches of FCEUD.  Even incomplete CDL logs will give much better results<br /><br /><br />oh.. btw Chase HQ uses a mapper, so you have to tell the disassembler where to start and end.. it probably didn't show the code you were looking for because it wasn't in the first 8k, which is what will get read if you don't tell it otherwise.<br /><br />you have to manually do the mapper stuff because the disassembler is has no concept of mappers... just like the NES console itself doesn't have a concept of mappers.. it just reads the 8k of prg memory<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3841">frantik</a> — Mon Mar 14, 2011 4:20 am</p><hr />

Nice, but I split two files, a Chase HQ NES file and a pure program BIN....Why is the program full of "illegal opcode"s? That'd be a nice fix. And also, this tool is pretty nice, but truthfully still isn't good enough to use to me and probably others, since it runs into so many illegal opcodes in normal code. I cxan't even find intructions like a read from $4016 when I know there is one that I need to change. Hopefully this gets fixed in the next version. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Sat Mar 12, 2011 3:30 pm</p><hr />

Hey guys,<br /><br />I am the guy that came up with FCEUXD's Code/Data logger, the specification for the CDL files, and all of that. That stuff was all my idea back in 2004. My other idea was this exact project - a smart disassembler that produces a reassemblable disassembly using the CDL files (and ALL files - more on that later) as input. I actually implemented the disassembler (calling it xdDasm), but the project was abandoned. I never got it functional enough to be happy releasing it.<br /><br />One thing I also implemented was an Address Label Logger. Basically FCEUXd would log these *.ALL files that would have ASCII lines that tell which instruction in the rom accessed which address in the rom. It was very useful for making labels work correctly across banks since if you see a JMP $8097, you don't know which bank that references and hence don't know where to put a label. It would only log accesses that went across banks.<br /><br />Anyway, I am very happy to see someone else has done the disassembler. I know of a few other people that attempted this. _hyde_ had special logs he outputted from his own emu, and made his own unreleased disassembler - he did a lot of games with it. I don't know what snowbro used to make disassemblies for metroid and King's Quest 5 - he may have implemented something like this for it. Disch wrote his own smart disassembler and used his own logs from his emulator to do one for Final Fantasy 1. It's a pretty solid idea, just no-one has made a generic disassembler to do it.<br /><br />You can find most of the disassemblies here that were produced by the above mentioned people.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://gilgalad.arc-nova.org/vgscr/nes.html">http://gilgalad.arc-nova.org/vgscr/nes.html</a><!-- m --><br />(megaman 3 is the only one there that is xdDasm output. It was the only game I really got xdDasm to working with before I abandoned it)<br /><br />There are a few cases I know of where this kind of smart disassembly won't work. There are games like Zelda which copies much of it's code to RAM. It won't be logged as code if it's being copied to RAM. Also, Fester's Quest has an annoying random number generator that likes to read random data from the ROM causing lots of crap to be logged as data (you have to hack that random number generator to be *nicer* before logging that game)<br /><br />bbitmaster<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4801">bbitmaster</a> — Sat Mar 05, 2011 12:48 am</p><hr />

Also looks like FCEUX thought it was data too, because it was marked as both data and code in the CDL file.  Maybe "code" should always trump "data".<br /></div><br /><br />I added an option to disable creating labels in the PRG area (is that the right name?  $8000 - $FFFF) when using STA/X/Y<br /><br />working on a good way to be able to name them (right now when you make any label it will be placed into the program code unless it has a + or - in the text (but doesnt start with +/-))<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3841">frantik</a> — Sat Feb 26, 2011 11:41 pm</p><hr />
