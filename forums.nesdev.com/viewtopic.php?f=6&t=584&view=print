		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know if I should put this in the general forums or here, but because more people seems to browse here, I decided to post it here. (don't be scared cause of this, because you may not even read this if I posted it in the General Stuff area, hehe it's natural to try to make as much people as possible to read your posts, isn't it ?)
<br />
<br />I noted, while reading some review on <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com" class="postlink">http://www.gamefaqs.com</a>, that many review of NES games or NES hardware says thing like :
<br />"The games really made great music even surpassing the horrible NES MIDI limitation", or "You know, the NES is only able to render horrible MIDI sound, so it's hard to rate the sound of this game", or even worse for NES hardware reviews "The NES is only able to play horrible MIDIs, but back in the time it's sound was pretty good".
<br />I think the thing that is awfully horrible is the stupidity of people writing this. They don't even know what a MIDI is, nor what a Square wave, Triangle wave or Noise wave is. If they are persons that loves modern gaming and write reviews for games they played earlier for nostalgy, they don't know that what their favorite PS2 or somethings outpouts something much closer to MIDI format than the NES, and if they are just old games fan, they just don't know what is a MIDI file.
<br />
<br />First of all, MIDI is a file format, while the NES is a hardware.
<br />
<br />The MIDI format is "powerfull", much more than the NES hardware, it actually is a standard format to record song for synthetisers and computers, and the quality of a MIDI file 100% depends on witch hardware it is played. If it is played with an old synthetiser, it can sound very bad, but newest ones can reach an amazing sound quality, with the same format. Now with selectable sound fonts, the MIDI format is nearly-indefinitely expanded. So referring to MIDI as a quality is totally crazy, scince MIDI is only sequnenced note, without any quality limitation or restrictions.
<br />
<br />However, I think even old and simple sound circuit such as the NES apu can not be reproducted by the MIDI format in any forms. There is a Square wave instrument in the main MIDI instrument definition, but it usually sound rather than a techno synthetised sound that an actual pure square wave. And where are arpeggio effects, volume effects (others than main volume control), duty cycle change, etc, etc... ? Huh ? The MIDI falls apart with all the effects that the NES can outpout. Even if the MIDI is a format and the NES APU a hardware, I think both thing are the most opposite thing ever made in the computer sound department.
<br />
<br />I really can't belive that people can be that stupid, calling square waves and stuff MIDIs. That's incredibly awfull.
<br />
<br />Edit : What I say can easily be proven by googleing "horrible NES midi" : <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=horrible+NES+midi" class="postlink">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=horrible+NES+midi</a>

<br />Other than that the MPEG audio file has to be distributed separately from the MIDI file perhaps? There appears to be no widely supported format for embedding samples as system exclusive messages in a standard MIDI file. You must be thinking of MOD or its progeny, which stores a sequence (a la NED) but also stores a mini-soundfont to play it with.

<br />So what's the Interface for sending Digital audio sample banks to Digital Musical Instruments? There's the "Sample Dump Standard" that runs as a SysEx over MIDI, but I don't see wide support, especially given that the maximum data rate of MIDI is 25 kbps (not counting start/stop bits).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />MIDI is basically not designed to listen to songs, but rather to show the notes of a song while be still able to hear how it sounds at the same time. Composing tunes are much easier with a MIDI tracker than with just a piano and some paper, like did the composer before the 21st century. You can easily put notes, then listen to them immediately and see if it sound good or not, and edit it if not. I think "traditional" composing is better to get great melodies, but it horrible to get any form of accompagnment.
<br />
<br />The fact that MIDI sucks is a bad popular belief, because they noted that their favorite songs didn't play right in that format. And the fact to think that the NES plays MIDIs is just AWFULL !
<br />Playing a five-minute sample in a MIDI sample is possible as long as you have a sound cart that support sound font swapping, so you're able to make your own samples. It's memory is probably limited, tough.
<br />
<br />A format that really sucks is MP3, simply because it has a terrible recording quality.

<br />I'm against this stupid popular belief because MIDI is justly tracked with sampled waveforms, while the NES does outputs synthetised waveforms. I think that the SNES outpouts something closer to MIDI than the NES, and, reading the SNES hardware reviews, everyone says the opposite ! Isn't that horrible ?

<br />That makes simply me mad. I can't understand why this review from that f****ing bastard was even approved. I don't think I wil browse gamefaqs anymore, actually. I'm too much scared. Not only they have a lot of poor-quality reviews, but also there is a lot of f***ing publicity. The only good point of that site is that *any* game, even as unknow as possible, is on database.

<br />
<br />It's a shame you consider the NES (and other systems of that era) to have crappy sound hardware. I think what makes something crappy is when it is claimed to be something else. NES sound is a crappy substitute for the SNES SPC sound processor, but it's not crappy for a simple analog sound chip.

<br />If the 2A03 had had a sweepable resonant low-pass filter on each channel like the TB303 and Moog synths did, it might not have sounded so "crappy", instead approaching the sound of FM synthesis.

<br />Lol, you're right. But the only time I've heard a NES music recorded in MP3 format (it was MM2 I believe), I found it plain horrible. The nice sound of a pure pule wave the channels makes is sounding bad because of low sampling rate and interpolation.
<br />I admit the sound chip in the NES honestly is rather limitated and odd, in newer titles. The first time I heard a NES sound (I already have a SNES and a PlayStation) I was instantly disapointed. I enjoyed so much the music in SNES and PS games that I was pretty much disapointed to hear simple analog sound, but at least I knew it was a simple analog sound and not MIDI at all. I eventually take taste to it, and now I enjoy it pretty much, even if I still prefer sampled music. I wouldn't qualify the NES sound as to be horrible, but simple would be the right word. I actually prefer good analog music (aka later MM games, Just Breed, Final Fantasy 3, etc...) to bad sampled music (Soul Blazer, Dragon Warrior 5, Super Double Dragon) that sound horrible from my viewpoint because they had bad and low-quality samples. However, I prefer good sampled music (Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger, Tactics Ogre) that have high quality sound samples to bad analog music (Super Mario Bros. 1, Dragon Warrior 1, Final Fantasy 1) that have great music but terrible sound quality.
