<br />It's the most official color you could get, since it's from the official company, and GBA displays things like how they wanted, especially after SP came in.
<br />
<br />It would make the most sense.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's not, it filled the need for color TV which was backwards compatible with black &amp; white TV before any others. It's just old. Nowadays (interlaced games) you can play a game in composite and hardly see the difference between it and component/RGB. Anyways, I would take the low color bandwidth of NTSC over the flickeryness of a 50Hz set anyway. And it's all a moot point since the best games are all developed for 525 lines / 60Hz.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />NTSC crams more than one signal together, so it acts sort of like digital where there is a hard limit to resolution. With RGB, there's no design limit to resolution, since each signal is carried separately. It's not that NTSC was a crappy standard, it's that we haven't moved forward fast enough; the damn thing is over 40 years old! I recently got a TV with an S-Video input and that is so much clearer looking than composite looks on the thing from the same system, so things did move forward (and of course component is to die for).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Now you're just making up excuses.  They don't flicker because...
<br />
<br />1)  it's easier to program a video emulation driver that doesn't emulate the PPU to the point of artifacts such as that, &amp;...
<br />2)  Nintendo is ALOT bigger, which means more flickering = more seizure lawsuits.  That's why you get the warning message whenever you power on any modern Nintendo console.  They've even gone through the trouble of modifying virtual consoler ROMS to reduce the amount of flickering.  That's why you don't get the classic red, green, blue death animation in Zelda II.

<br />
<br />I mean interpolation.  Flicker as in how something like pocketnes squeezes the image into the GBA screen and the lines fight over which is being displayed by flickering from one to another, and since GBA has frame blurring it makes it into a blur of the two fighting lines.
<br />
<br />But in Zelda, the graphics were editted so that it wouldn't produce more colors from the frame interpolation.
