		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I disabled my NES lockout chip tonight to try and fix the flashing red light problem I was having. However, now I get a gray screen on most every game that I have. The only games that will play are Super Mario Bros/Duck Hunt and Tengen Pac-Man. My Super Mario Bros 2, Super Mario Bros 3, Donkey Kong Classics, Legend of Zelda, Mario Bros Classic Arcade and Home Alone won't boot. <br /><br />I'm not 100% certain if it's due to the carts not being very clean or if it's some other problem. I've ordered a cleaning kit for my carts to try and see if they need further cleaning. I have done some simple cleaning with rubbing alcohol and Q-Tips, but I haven't been able to get all my games working again.<br /><br />What are some other suggestions to get my games working again? Is there any reason that cutting pin 4 on the lockout chip would break compatibility? I may need to install another lockout chip if that is the case.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />After a little more in depth cleaning with my rubbing alcohol and Q-Tips, I was able to get a few more games working. I'm glad I didn't damage the internals while cutting pin 4 of my lockout chip. I'll have to wait for my cleaning kit to come in to give my carts a proper cleaning. I'll also look into getting a new cartridge connector that has been cleaned and refurbished. Nintendo Repair Shop sells them for about $10. If it would make my NES run like new again, I'd buy one. Does anyone have experience with these refurbished connectors and their reliability?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I would not buy a new connector and would advice just to fix your current one (I've heard mixed story about them). You just need to bend the pin a little with a needle or something. As for the the issue you are having, I think that either your connector or cart edge pin are dirty. Before the mod, it would flash because the lock-out chip couldn't authenticate the cart because of the dirt, now you get the same issue except that the lockout chip no longer whine about it and the nes display the solid color screen instead. <br /><br />By the way, did you connect pin four of the CIC to ground? It is advised not to let that pin floating but I doubt it is the cause of your issue,

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the tips about the new connector. I will look at adjusting my existing connector and seeing if I can get it to work better. I am slightly curious though about how a new connector would work if it is properly cleaned and not a reproduction connector. As far as the mod, I didn't connect pin 4 to ground. I didn't see that part about the mod until after I disconnected the pin from the motherboard. I'm fairly certain that the issue I'm experiencing is due to dirt in the cart edges or connector and not the floating pin 4.

I'm fairly certain now that the issue is with my carts having dirty edges and my connector being slightly dirty. The only game that doesn't work for me at the moment is Home Alone, but I've always had issues with that cart. I bought it at a Gamestop that had some NES stock left a while back and I know that it's in very used condition. I've only gotten it to boot a few times on my NES. As far as those three games, I'm not too concerned that they won't work without a functional CIC. Most games that I get aren't multicarts if I can help it. I like to get the single carts for expanding my collection further. I'm an avid retro Nintendo collector and have been working on widening my NES game library over the past couple of weeks.

Other than that, cleaning your carts is probably the most important thing to do. It can take awhile, but I actually cleaned all my cartridges recently. You shouldn't have to clean them very often but it's a safe bet if you've *never* cleaned one of your cartridges that it probably would benefit from a cleaning. The whole lockout chip disabling really doesn't help with getting games to start on the first try. You should only disable your lockout chip if you need to run cartridges with no CIC or another region CIC. It shouldn't be done thinking that is why your games won't start up/red blinking light. While it's true that happens, it's because your cartridge is dirty. It's just a great sign that you should clean your game.

I plan to expand my Famicom game library soon too so having my console region free will help. <br /><br />I have a Tri-Star Super 8 coming some time next week that plays Famicom games, but I'd like to keep my options open. It's a famiclone so not everything will supported. I haven't been able to find a wiki listing the compatible NES/Famicom games on the Tri-Star Super 8, but I plan to compile my findings once my Super 8 arrives. I'm not exactly sure about compatibility with Famicom games on the NES, but it's something worth pursuing too.

The difference between a dirty cart and one cleaned this way is like going back to a brand new cartridge.</div><br />That's good to hear about the Famicom games on the NES. I've read that they're essentially the same system with a 60 pin connector for the Famicom and 72 pin connector for the NES, extra audio support for the Famicom, and a microphone for the Famicom's second controller. I'd need a 60 to 72 pin adapter for playing Famicom games on the NES. Also, I believe some people have modded their NES to support the extra audio channels outputted by some Famicom games like Akumajou Densetsu.<br /><br />I changed the thread status to &quot;SOLVED&quot; because I have determined that my carts are just dirty after some further troubleshooting. I can get each of my games to boot now, even Home Alone. I did a light cleaning with rubbing alcohol on the carts, but I will be doing a more in depth clean soon. I sometimes have to angle the carts slightly to the left or right to get a good connection (not sure how that makes a better connection than straight in), but that should change after I do a full cleaning on the carts. I ordered a security bit for opening my carts and it should be arriving soon so I'll do a full cleaning of each game shortly. I also cleaned my cart connector and motherboard cart connector edge so that should be much better than before.
