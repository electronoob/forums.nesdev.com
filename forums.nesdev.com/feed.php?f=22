Hello!<br /><br />The tool itself can do everything except change the graphics right now; your understanding is correct! The only thing is that I do not give a good way to replace the built-in graphics. (Though that could be a fun extension some day) <br /><br />If you have graphics that you are willing to let others use, I'd be happy to add them to the tool! Otherwise we would have to do something slightly custom. <br /><br />If you want to get started yourself, you could use something like Shiru's <a href="https://shiru.untergrund.net/software.shtml" class="postlink">NES Screen Tool</a> to replace the existing game tiles and sprites. (Use the import menu to pull in the NES file, and choose the &quot;bank&quot; matching what you want to replace, then use the export menu to save the new graphics to that same rom) The one challenge after that is that the credits screen would show the wrong information about the sprites. I don't have a quick fix for that problem.<br /><br />I saw your pm as well; will be replying shortly.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6316">cppchriscpp</a> — Thu Jan 24, 2019 10:54 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Also - it's awesome to hear that you've used the tool to wireframe graphics!!!<br /></div><br />Another use is to quickly check if a sprite + sprite palette works against some certain backdrop + bg palette combination you've drawn. When you've got a full game engine going on, that's easy to do, but when you work on concept graphics before there is any game, this quite useful and only takes a minute. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />It's fun how people showing us how they use the tool helps us inform the changes to make.<br /></div>I'm happy you feel that way! I cannot thank you enough for the effort you've put into this tool, and for keeping developing it. As a GUI designer for public space kiosks, i recognize that once your product gets out in the wild, there's always lots of use cases you could never have foreseen - which i've found can be both amazing and frustrating. <br /><br />I think one difference you might see between people who've been already knee-deep in assembly programming and nes game design, and the new group that make the NESmaker user majority, is that the latter group will largely adapt and be closely inspired by your personal workflow through your video tutorials, while the former group will try applying and adapting their already established workflow to NESmaker. This means doing things in a different order, for one thing, which may cause some &quot;feature gaps&quot; (which is always a subjective thing for each user) to magically appear. <br /><br />For example, in your videos, you create assets and objects, assign them properties, and then paint some screens. But if you for example create assets and objects, paint some screens, and <em>then </em>assign properties, you're put in a bit of a spot currently as maps won't auto-update accordingly. It's a bit of a tricky situation though... if implementing auto-updates to the meta screen tables, you'd need to identify intentional property deviations made by the user as to not overwrite them. I guess comparing previously held tile/path property with screen contents should mask out what cells to update with the new property.<br /><br />Speaking of map construction, have you thought about implementing edit filters like the ones in NESST? I'd not copy the checkboxes which can get in the way and confuse users at first, but holding for example shift and click to only &quot;paint&quot; properties from an asset, or ctrl+click to only paint the metatile of an asset without overwriting previous properties would accelerate level building by some. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />There is, however, a future plan for a library-graphic system like what you're describing where values are still metatiles, but it alternately references library values rather than strict tethers to the tileset.<br /></div><br />This is great news! Just to show you something NESmaker related i'm working on. I'm still reworking the tileset to better fit the current NESmaker scheme, so it still looks less detailed than it actually could, but here's the rationalization-in-progress:<br /><br />nesmaker.png<br />which works fine from a gameplay perspective. I think i can get a lot more out of it, though, especially with the &quot;ignore path&quot; property you've introduced semisecretly, if it is going to do what i think it does. <br /><br />Second picture is an earlier mockup draft. <br />beach3.bmp<br />I'd need to rationalize &amp; remove some uneffective tiles from there to include rocks and other mechanically needed tiles, but this (or more, really) is about the level of detail you could get out of NESmaker with a metatile reference library, even when needing a text/symbol table occupying several rows of chr-ram.<br /><br />I'm building an arcade cabinet experience for a local museum that are producing an exhibition about trash in general and sea pollution in particular. The cabinet itself, including special peripherals (and the whole exhibition for that matter) is built out of salvage, second hand electronics and new-old-stock parts. The game is about sanitizing the coast off trash in a dystopic near future. The game reflects points and items in the exhibition. Between the material costs and time spent constructing it and the budget i'm, using NESmaker felt like the obvious choice to get it all done on time. This project wouldn't be sane without NESmaker providing both GUI tools and a solid backbone to build on. Having it lets me focus all the more on conceptual and game rules design and not worry so much about this or that method for controller input, whether to use samples or not, and so on. <br />items.png_helloworld.gif<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Wed Jan 23, 2019 9:06 am</p><hr />
