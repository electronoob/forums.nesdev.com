tokumaru: BxROM isn't even listed in <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/downloads/repropakmanual.pdf" class="postlink">the board's manual</a>; it's a modification of the board's support for AxROM that bunnyboy and I discussed one day. The 161 is in the position for AxROM, but you solder the HORIZ or VERT pads instead of the ONE pads. I don't even think there's a trace for PRG A18.<br /><br />slobu: Say someone made a reprogrammable NES cartridge. Which mapper would this board implement? There are a lot more mappers on the NES than on any other 8-bit platform because only the NES has CHR ROM. But as I understand it, the 8T-ROM is supposed to be something like the Melody board. And once it comes out and gets emulated, remind me and I'll update the wizard. Right now the closest thing, a board reprogrammable for multiple discrete mappers, might be a PowerPak Lite with its PRG RAM replaced with flash memory.<br /><br />As for the CHR ROM vs. CHR RAM section, is the wording in <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/CHR-ROM_vs_CHR-RAM" class="postlink">this wiki article</a> OK?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Feb 24, 2012 8:03 am</p><hr />

Ok, links and question K fixed. Thanks, Dwedit for spotting that. I also exported the PNG at a larger DPI so one can actually read it. I hope I didn't make it too wide and make the thread require horizontal scrolling (I hate that).<br /><br />Thanks Bregalad for the hardware perspective of why the MMC1 would be like that. From the little hardware dabbling I've done, I can appreciate the value of reducing the pin count. But from software (my strong side), it just seems weird.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3412">Karatorian</a> — Thu Feb 23, 2012 10:52 am</p><hr />

As for TNROM on PowerPak, I'm aware of this bug. I'm treating "yes carts" and "no carts, yes PowerPak" as the same, and I don't really have a separate decision tree for "no carts, yes PowerPak". Really the only reason I have the "do you want to run on carts" and "do you want to run on PowerPak" questions is to weed out people who get Hello World running in Nesticle and then think they're NES programmers.<br /><br />I could change it to remember the "no carts, yes PowerPak" choice, but then I'd skip MMC5 screens because I lack faith that the PowerPak's MMC5 is perfect, and I'd make PRG RAM available with all of Nintendo's discrete mappers. I'd also have to make a choice: either make it in JavaScript (and have it fail for users who use NoScript) or make it in PHP (and have it fail when run offline). And at that point, I'd probably put a question distinguishing donor carts from virgin carts earlier in the sequence.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Then if you want to make carts just clone the MMC3 with a CPLD<br /></div><br />I'm excluding configurations requiring equipment and skills that others, like you, are likely to personally lack. Once bunnyboy makes such a ReproPak MMC3 board available, remind me and I'll revise the entire MMC3 section.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Feb 23, 2012 8:03 am</p><hr />

This is wrong, you don't need to "destroy a japan-only game" (he means Destiny of an Emperor II and Final Fantasy III) to simulate TNROM with the power pack.<br />Then if you want to make carts just clone the MMC3 with a CPLD which is nothing complicated to do it just requires some (expensive) CPLD programing tools and some SMD soldering skills (both of which I personally lack).<br /><br />Tepples, your program is great, and definitely more complete than my chart ! However it asks many questions at once, but I guess it simplifies the logic.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Feb 23, 2012 1:24 am</p><hr />
