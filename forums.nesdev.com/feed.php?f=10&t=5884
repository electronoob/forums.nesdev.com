This guide helped me more with 6502 than any other. I don't know about that book, but read this, and if you still have questions you can get some books. Or... ask us.

I don't know much about actual books, because the 2 of them I had in my hands were pretty weak, and even had errors. Around here people suggest "Programming the 6502" by Rodnay Zaks a lot, so I guess it's probably one of the best books around.<br /><br />Personally, I learned from online material only. <a href="http://www.obelisk.demon.co.uk/6502/index.html" class="postlink">This</a> is an interesting introduction to the 6502. Don't forget to check <a href="http://6502.org/" class="postlink">http://6502.org/</a> for 6502 information.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Dec 29, 2009 12:08 pm</p><hr />

There's no "multiply" command so you will have to calculate using adds and shifting bits, and it's likely you won't be able to fit all the numbers into the registers at once so you will have to copy data back and forth.<br /><br />Alternatively there are faster ways to do multiplication using lookup tables.<br /><br />It gets pretty complicated at times!

First you have to learn some assembly, and understand how it differs from the high-level languages you are used to work with. Read as many 6502 docs/books as you can, and practice what you learn on the <a href="http://home.pacbell.net/michal_k/6502.html" class="postlink">6502 simulator</a>. It's an excellent tool to test your knowledge, and you don't have to bother about configuring assemblers and making ROMs just to understand how the CPU works.<br /><br />Once you have a decent understanding of the CPU (i.e. you can code a few routines to do basic things like multiplication and division, number sorting, and so on), you can study the PPU. Don't just read the docs though, use the debugging features of FCEUXD (for example) to observe how commercial games modify the palette, the name tables, attribute tables and so on. That, along with the docs, should give you a good idea of what the NES can do and how.<br /><br />Then you can start your first demo. Pick an assembler (I use ASM6 because it doesn't require any configurations, so it's very straightforward) and start making programs that animate sprites, draw background tiles, read the joypad, things like that. Soon the NES will feel like home.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Dec 29, 2009 11:09 am</p><hr />
