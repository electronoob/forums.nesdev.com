<br />The Nintendo CIC was produced in at least four variants. We are not trying to create a drop-in replacement; we are trying to create a key chip that is <em>more</em> flexible than the Nintendo CIC. If we wanted to make a drop-in replacement, we would just write one region to the chip's nonvolatile memory at manufacture time.

<br />We're trying to minimize the amount of user interaction in order to get it to decide whether to retry the same region or switch to a different region as of the next power-on, as people don't read manuals.

<br />I doubt kevtris will require that your program interact with the chip, rather simply allow it to do so in order to reduce the time taken by auto-detection. I imagine the chip will serve three levels of use, the higher ones being more desirable to the end-user:
<br />
<br />1) Basic: chip is pre-configured for a particular region and works as if were the real thing
<br />
<br />2) Auto-scanning: chip will determine correct region after multiple power-cycles, without any help from the NES program
<br />
<br />3) User-assisted: instructions appear on screen for user to hold certain buttons based on their region
<br />
<br />Further, I imagine that all three levels will be served by the <em>same</em> chip and software program, with each being implemented in a way that doesn't conflict with the others. If this is the case, the programmer and producer of the cartridge can decide what level to use.

I was worried for a moment when the timing of the first 15-bit transmission seemed to be different, but it actually is the same (the first transmissions are zero for half of the seed possibilities).  I don't think it will take long to crack this one (based on early findings), but I can't say for sure until I have the seeds.
<br />
<br />Can someone explain to me how pressing buttons on the controller can simplify the region select processs?  Even with this method, the user must press Reset after pressing (and holding) the correct button for the region of choice.  Assuming the 3195 and 3197 are combined into one region selection, it will take no more than two resets to set the correct region if auto-detect were used, and pressing Reset twice is simpler to me than reading a blinking message, holding down a button, and pressing Reset.

<br />
<br />Yeah, I'm not too fond of that idea myself.  I think auto region detection is the way to go.  I only have 8 pins on the chip, and 6 are used right off the bat for lockout functionality.  The user will have to press reset anyways to try out the change, so I don't see where it is useful to press some "chord" of buttons on the controller.  
<br />
<br />That implies that there is a way to get data TO the chip from the NES which is easier said than done (you'd need at least 2 bits of output from a latch or whatever to do this).
<br />
<br />I could go with an 18 pin chip but then it's kinda big.  The 8 pinner was cute 'cause it was half the size of the original.  
<br />
<br />I think my original plan I came up with was pretty bulletproof and will be agreeable to the end user.
<br />
<br />Oh btw, the "Asian version" NES units are PAL.  The chips in the Tetris carts I bought were NES-EI-0  for CHR (which is the same as NTSC) and PAL-EI-0 for the PRG.  Nothing too strange about that; I suspect most PAL carts are like that.    
<br />
<br />
<br />Crud.  I forgot to make up a 6113 set of lockout data.  It might be interesting to see what it does differently.  I should set that up tonight and upload it, along with a 6113 and a 3193 communicating.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, the next CIC I looked at had a different layout.  I was not expecting this since even the SNES CIC had the same layout as the NES one in the US.  However, the processor + circuitry, on cursory inspection, appears the same (same rom, same ram, some pieces just moved around)... don't underestimate the word cursory in there though <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Something changed drastically in the processing as well.  I had a VERY hard time staining the ROM.  Different regions stained than last time, and the ROM region seemed unaffected.  After some fiddling I eventually managed to delineate the ion implantation regions.
<br />
<br />Check it out here:
<br />3195A from france
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.neviksti.com/CIC/3195A/">http://www.neviksti.com/CIC/3195A/</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />
<br />Since many of the algorithms are known now, I'm hoping we can reverse engineer the actual instruction code ... and then we get the SNES CIC code for free as well!

<br />
<br />Yep, it appears to work!  great job on the seed finding mission.  I will let it run all night at full speed to see what happens.  It made it through about 10 minutes so far, so I'm confident it is correct.
<br />
<br />Now that all 4 seeds have been found, the fun part of making the universal chip begins.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some questions:
<br />
<br />1. What happens if there is no CIC in the NES (as is the case with a top loader)?  I suspect the PIC won't run wince there's no 4 MHz clock.  If the "lockout functioning" pin were polled in this case, would it read back as 0 or 1?
<br />
<br />2. What happens if the CIC in the NES is disabled via pin 4 (i.e. the master CIC is in key mode)?  Will the PIC function at all?  Can the PIC detect this condition?
<br />
<br />The important thing here is to keep a game utilizing the "lockout functioning" output from thinking there's a lockout error when in reality there is no lockout functionality to begin with.
<br />
<br />3. How will you distribute the final result?
