<br />Don't know exactly what that kyuu fellow was all on about.. Somehow he drew a correlation between this thread and said PowerPak... Probably a slip of some sort. Well I forgive him.. I'm sure we all can. 
<br />
<br />Speaking of the PowerPak now.. Last I heard they were out of production?
<br />
<br />Is that true?
<br />
<br />If so, it doesn't take a genius to see that making the schematics available would be beneficial to all parties.

<br />
<br />Mike: to reiterate, schematics are useless with programmable devices such as CPLD and MCU, you additionally need at least the fusemaps and firmware, and for any sort of educational value, source. If you can't come up with a schematic, you probably aren't coming up with a design/program to put into the devices. Regardless, anyone who understands the basics of computer buses can pull apart a discrete mapper game using pinouts published on sites such as this one. In another thread you were also pointed to the FunkyFlash project which contains schematics *and* mapper designs to a fully functional flash cart and you're still going on about the lack of free options; there's nothing stopping anyone from making a flash cart except their self.
<br />
<br />And PowerPaks are in stock.

I know I'd be somewhere else.  I am personally envious of the powerpak's ability to remain so cheap (being a relative term, I know $135 seemed like a lot more when I first found out about it).
<br />
<br />It is true though, a schematic is <em>almost</em> nothing without the firmware for it.  That in mind, designing my project would have been a lot easier if more schematics of <em>anything</em> were available.  BTW I'm gonna be posting mine sometime soon.

<br />I'm sorry you believe I've taken it that way because none of your posts have directly involved me and that's not what I meant to communicate. My comments are just responses to your comments (my opinion on your opinion), nothing personal, olive branch taken. I don't dislike you or something, I quite like your demeanor, and don't take this as a personal attack, but in a short time you <span style="text-decoration: underline">have</span>: 
<br />
<br />-asked for plans to build the PowerPak, with a signature implying the "NES scene" (Nesdev?) would benefit from an open source flash cart
<br />-commented that more widespread flash carts would rejuvenate the NES' popularity (in a positive tone)
<br />-commented that flash carts "aren't popular", because of greed
<br />-praised kathaku for making the schematics to his device available (did he offer before your comment?)
<br />-shown enthusiasm over the schematics (which I didn't believe you understood are not usable without firmware)
<br />-expressed interest in an Instructable citing it would increase the number of people capable of working on Nesdev
<br />-quite plainly expressed that free schematics are "beneficial to all parties" 
<br />
<br />To me that qualifies as "going on about" free (in the open source sense of the word) options. 
<br />
<br />(Warning: run-on) and the only reason it irks me is because you have made it clear you're all about open source flash carts, and you claim indirectly/by default that (the high cost or propriety of?) the PowerPak is greedy, yet it doesn't sound like you're going to be heading up your own "people's flash cart" (though you've been pointed to FunkyFlash and are on a site with all the necessary NES-specific resources available). Instead, and I could very well be wrong, it just sounds like you want other people to release their projects with the hope that that a saturated market would yield a less expensive device for you and people which might develop free NES software for you to play... Not that there'd be anything wrong with that, but it's hypocritical to criticize capitalist flash carts as they quite similarly look after their own interests and in the PowerPak's case, pretty humbly.

<br />
<br />According to a search... The first time I mentioned the device, was, well, yesterday, in this thread, replying to a post by Jeroen!
<br />
<br />As for the ideal of schematics needing firmware for programming, etcetera.. I'm well aware, and always have been. That's what our electronics laboratory back here is for. No need to worry, friend, it's covered.
<br />
<br />But alas, I am always a supporter of Instructables and How-Tos and MAKE and the like. Why? Seeing how other people have achieved the results your after, well, it gives you the opportunity to improve on their designs! Call it open source design, call it part of the scientific method... I call it Fun!
<br />
<br />As for market saturation... Nahh. I have no interest in anything like that.  Given schematics, etc, I probably wouldn't even build one! But I sure would try to improve on the design. It's what I do... It's what's fun <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />So, in closing, thanks for accepting the digital olive branch! I'm glad we've avoided a flame war. Haven't been in one of those since I was, oh, around 13 or so? Well it was more than a decade ago.. Maybe 94 or 96. 
<br />
<br />I think it's safe to say we can close this topic now. I have lunch to eat! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

PowerPAK is to my knowledge the only available NES flash cartridge so you clearly made that comment about it as there is no other target out there. When I first heard about the PowerPAK I thought it sounded awesome. But when I heard what it cost I had to think about it, for about a minute. But then I realized that 135$ to me was a bargin considering all it could do for me. While I can see how some people will pass on the PowerPAK due to its cost, it's not for everyone really. But if it's worth it to you and you want it I don't believe it is that out of reach to most people that may want it. 
<br />
<br />The PowerPAK I'm sure has encouraged alot of people to look into the NES again. There's just something special about using the actual hardware opposed to an emulator.

<br />
<br />If you really think about it, it's not that much out of reach: it just the price of ~2 PS3/XBOX360 games (in japan) so it's not that expensive (unless you're a student with no income which is another story).  
<br />
<br />Just Biohazard 5 + Street Figther IV combined together are more than a powerpak so..
<br />
<br />Edit: I few extra confirmation for origin of cost.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I bought one. Compared to what I spent on my first 6 NES games in the late 80s it's cheap. And as a programmer I spend a lot of money on books and tools. $135 is still not that much compared to many books most programmers end up buying. (It's only April and I've bought 8 books already this year). Putting sockets on a donor cart or getting a new empty cart is still pretty expensive when you consider you'll want to get an UV eraser (easily $30) and ample supply of EPROMs (easily $20) and the programmer (which at the cheapest is about $60). Going the route of not buying a PowerPak but still using the real hardware to verify your code I suspect will run around $110 unless you're a particularly adept scavenger.
<br />
<br />As a professional embedded developer, $135 is cheap compared to the price of a JTAG bdm/ice/debugger/programmer that I normally have to get for doing similar work. (not that the NES has JTAG, too bad). It's a very small price  compared to a good digital oscope(I still need one), and it wouldn't even cover the cables for a proper logic analyzer, let alone the LA itself.
<br />
<br />My regret with the PowerPak is that it is not compatible with the NES clones(I like my retro duo's SNES controller ports). And that it's not available in a Famicom version. It would have been interesting to use it on one of those cheap famicom computers with the keyboard being sold in Asia and India. Speaking of which, anyone know how it works, is it done through the normal controller port. It would be nice to build a keyboard for the NES (and mouse, but just duplicate the SNES mouse protocol).
<br />
<br />If you don't have a couple hundred bucks to spend on a NES development hobby, then you'll have to make due with the emulators only and test a bunch of different ones to have at least some confidence in compatibility. Compared to hobbies like RC airplanes, bicycling, boating, gardening, etc it's cheaper. Although it doesn't give you an excuse to go outside. So perhaps the PowerPak 2 ought to be wind powered or at least have pedals and a generator to justify it's "high price". It's almost 1/2 of the price of a cheap Chinese-made mountain bike, so expensive. But infinitely better quality.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
