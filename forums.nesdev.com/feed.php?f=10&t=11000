Something I was working on that was a bit of fun: I was able to get SMB running with mmc3 and placed the demo routine in its own bank with converted data from a FCEUX TAS for the demo playback. I never quite got it working properly though, and would lose sync in world 1-3. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />I found it was easy to make room in the default 32k program space by looking for a couple routines that are called only once or twice and moving them to a different bank and patching calls to those routines with appropriate bank changes. (Didn't read the thread carefully, sorry if that was already discussed.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4680">Movax12</a> — Thu Feb 13, 2014 4:16 pm</p><hr />

I decided to take 45 minutes out of my day and write a &quot;trivial&quot; FDS to FME-7 conversion kit. Instructions are included in the readme. Full source is included.<br /><br />You will need Nintendulator, the cc65 toolset, and probably a hex editor (I used XVI32), and also a suitable FDS file and the requisite DISKSYS.ROM to run it.<br /><br />I tested this on an FDS of Super Mario Bros, of course, and it seems to be running just fine.<br /><br />I dunno if there's much reason to convert FDS to FME-7 in general, DRW's request is a bit unique (especially since the INL boards can be set up for NROM anyway), but who knows, maybe somebody else will find it useful? Perhaps it's a good starting example that could lead to a more complex FDS to FME-7 conversion that could allow for some FDS repros using INL boards in their FME-7 configuration.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Thu Feb 13, 2014 10:39 am</p><hr />

The FDS <em>is</em> a cartridge full of RAM that plugs into a Famicom. The disk drive part is only used to load data into that RAM, so aside from the loading part, it's just a cartridge. Yes, it is its own mapper, but a lot of its games don't use most of  its features, especially if they were originally NROM games like Super Mario Bros..<br /><br />The reason I'm suggesting it is that its mapper design has some similarities to the FME-7. It has a &quot;fixed&quot; ROM at $E000-FFFF which was used for its BIOS code, and for this reason an NROM game ported to FDS will have its data already relocated from there, usually to $6000-7FFF. If the game was only a 32k/16k PRG NROM, usually this will be loaded into the FDS once at startup and after that no other FDS mapper features will be needed, so at that point it's effectively a mapper very much like our proposed NROM-368.<br /><br />Open the Super Mario Bros. FDS in an emulator and let it run until the game loads (e.g. get to the title screen), then do a memory dump from $6000-DFFF and you'll have all the data you need to build your PRG ROM. (Dump the 8k of CHR memory as well.) From there, just write a small startup program in the $E000-FFFF fixed bank that sets up your banks and nametable mirroring then jumps to Mario's code, and a vector table for NMI etc.<br /><br />For an FDS game to be suitable for a trivial conversion to FME-7, it should meet the following criteria, which I believe SMB does:<br /><br />1. Only loads data once. (If it loads data multiple times, you could write a replacement for the BIOS' loading code.)<br />2. Outside the initial data load, never writes to $6000-DFFF. (The FDS has RAM here so it's technically writable. You could use PRG-RAM at $6000-7FFF and load it manually for your FME-7 port. Ram writes at $8000-DFFF are non-portable, but likely extremely rare.)<br />3. Doesn't use the FDS' IRQ. (You could probably write a replacement with FME-7's IRQ but takes more work.)<br />4. Doesn't change nametable mirroring. (Requires replacing FDS mirror toggling code with FME-7 mirror toggling code.)<br />5. Doesn't use the FDS expansion audio. (We have a list of those games <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/List_of_games_with_expansion_audio#Nintendo_FDS" class="postlink">here</a>. This isn't much of a problem except that the extra audio won't play. I don't think the register writes are in conflict with the FME-7.)<br />6. The code in $6000-DFFF never calls BIOS code. (I.e. the code never jumps back to $E000-FFFF after the initial load. If it does, you'll need to write a replacement routine in the fixed bank.)<br />7. Doesn't write to CHR-RAM after load. (You could possibly run the FME-7 with CHR-RAM? Loading it then requires extra code.)<br />8. Doesn't write directly to nametable from load. (The FDS BIOS routines can load data from disk directly to the nametable. Requires extra code to duplicate this functionality.)<br /><br />You can verify each of these things pretty easily with breakpoints in a debugging emulator like FCEUX. If all of the criteria are met, the port should to FME-7 be extremely easy. Even if they aren't met, they can each be overcome (except the missing audio, or possibly RAM use at $8000-DFFF) with a little work.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Wed Feb 12, 2014 6:31 am</p><hr />

Games can be ported from one mapper to another. Dragon Quest and Maniac Mansion were ported from discrete mappers to MMC1 when brought to 72-pin land so that they could use battery RAM. Family Computer Disk System (FDS) games like Pro Wrestling, Zelda, Metroid, Kid Icarus, and Doki Doki Panic were ported to a cartridge mapper (UNROM, MMC1, or MMC3) when brought to 72-pin land. Tetris was ported from MMC1 to MMC3 to fit on the multicart with Super Mario Bros. and Nintendo World Cup, and Dr. Mario appears to have been ported from MMC1 to MMC3 for one of the official competition multicarts. Nintendo ported SMB1 to FDS, and pirates did the opposite for SMB2 (J).<br /><br />The claim made here is that porting certain FDS games to FME-7 could be almost trivial.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Feb 12, 2014 6:23 am</p><hr />

Excellent points, MottZilla. You must have the reset vector point to somewhere in the last PRG bank where you can find (or create, by moving something to the new bank and fixing any references to the moved code/data) enough room for the code that maps the new bank to $6000-$7FFF and jumps to the mapper setup code in it. After the whole configuration is done you can just JMP to $8000 to resume the original program.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Feb 11, 2014 1:33 pm</p><hr />

No one mentioned this yet but FME-7 supports mapping ROM to $6000-$7FFF which could be helpful. SMB resets to $8000, which won't work for the FME-7 which only fixes $E000-$FFFF. If you can find one of the reverse engineered source codes to the game, you should find some area in $E000-$FFFF that is either a routine or data set that you can find all the other references to, and alter those references to find the same thing somewhere in $6000-$7FFF where you will move it to. Then you can reuse the space in that last bank for your reset vector and calling an init routine that could also be in the $6000 bank. <br /><br />Since the source code is around it shouldn't be too hard.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Tue Feb 11, 2014 12:19 pm</p><hr />

If you're looking for games just for testing, try FDS games. They won't touch the fixed bank area at $E000-FFFF so you can be free to put your startup code there.
