<br />
<br />Thanks for the input. i am still going to see if i can fix it better before releasing it. Is there anything else that i am doing wrong (perhaps expecting a background write to happen smoothly?)

<br />Unless i am misunderstanding what you are telling me, i believe i am.
<br />
<br />I have the NMI set to trigger on VBlank, where it is incremented. 
<br />
<br />Other then that, i push the registers onto the stack, then run the next note from the embedded NSF file, then pull the registers back off the stack, and return from interrupt.

<br />
<br />if the graphics code executes after the note is played i think it would cause problems.. but i think you would see more than a "hickup".  so i don't really know.. lol

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When I was developing Pegs, I had the same issue. I was changing 12 tiles in the background, and when I did so, I got the hiccup you are talking about. I ended up curing this by writing only four tiles at a time, as well as the using the same code that Celius posted, I believe (check the source, because I honestly do not remember at this point). I'm pretty sure I just polled $2002 each time before writing, which as I understand from other posts isn't the best way, but it worked for me, and I've never experienced any lag on that game when played on the system.
<br />
<br />It kind of makes me wonder if there is a time when polling $2002 on the NES is acceptable, but has to be done at a certain point in the cycles. I don't know, I'm just speculating : P

<br />Soon after power-on, in order to make sure the PPU reset finished all the way. The typical sequence is poll $2002, clear CPU RAM, poll $2002, set palette, clear nametables. There's about a 1 out of 21 chance that you'll get lag on any frame; this chance is acceptable in something like power-on. But after that, use NMI.

<br />
<br />I don't want to rewrite the background every time the NMI is triggered (or at least the 12 tiles.) So unless i create a state system to handle different types of background writes, then embed that code into the NMI to handle those writes, that wont work.
<br />
<br />One of my goals in this demo was to create a simple procedural example of coding on the NES, but this adds needless complication for an inexperienced observer.
<br />
<br />If the aforementioned state system is my only option, i will take it, but i would prefer handling it in inline code to make it easier on the newbies that happen to read the source, or use it as a reference.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So Vblank is a variable incremented in the NMI? Exactly what is happening when the NMI is fired?
<br />
<br />Oh, and really make sure in your NMI routine you save A, X, and Y. If the A register is destroyed, the desired value won't be loaded into A upon returning.
<br />
<br />Here's my suggestion: put "STA $5555" at the very end of the posted code. Then open the ROM in FCEUXD. Go to Tools... Debug... Then under the "break points" box click "add". Then in the first text box next to "address" write $5555 and under it, click "write", then "OK". Then press 'A'. 
<br />
<br />It will break after that code is done. You can see what scanline it ends at and other information.
<br />
<br />And writing less probably isn't the answer. I was able to fit 182 PPU writes into 1 Vblank, so you just have to keep track of how many cycles everything is taking. Make sure it doesn't spill out of Vblank. That's probably what's causing the problem here, actually.

<br />No, except that the pattern of an ISR that just sets a flag might be more familiar to developers on platforms where you don't get to write your own ISRs, such as any multitasking OS. You could put the entire game in the NMI; Super Mario Bros. does just this. Just make sure you do the PPU updates as soon as possible after the start of vblank, which means before you run the sound engine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Polling the VBL count is simpler to code for, because you don't have to deal with re-entrancy and concurrency issues. If the code is executed from NMI, you need a flag to tell it when it can run, and where it's called from the mainline code is less-clear. Unless you're doing split-screen effects, you don't need code guaranteed to run every NMI, so the polling approach is better.
