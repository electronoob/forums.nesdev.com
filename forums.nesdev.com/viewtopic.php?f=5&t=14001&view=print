		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah I know....of all places and forums to talk about this emulator it ends up here but I'm frustrated.<br />I have been using this emulator since 2006/2007 to play Akumajou Dracula X Gekka no Yasoukyoku and Magic School Lunar.<br /><br />It have worked great and I still use it today but it kills me that it's 1. Closed source 2. The author is Japanese (not being racist for the record), virtually unknown and never ever publish what changes that have been done to the emulator and believe me I have tried finding change logs for years but have come up with absolutely nothing, zip, nada.<br /><br />Today (2016-03-26) a new TestVersion was released and what can I say.....change log: <strong>unknown</strong><br />What's been changed since Ver0.12 beta R4 (2013) and the last TestVersion from last September?<br />....................................<br />Exactly, no one knows but the author him/herself.<br /><br />This is what makes me frustrated, SSF is essentially <span style="text-decoration: underline">THE</span> best Sega Saturn emulator but the lack of communication and change logs from the author makes me want to pull my hair off.<br /><br />This is a sad state, because what happens when the author decides to no longer work on it and leave the emulator to it's fate?<br />It dies unfortunately.<br /><br />The author doesn't really own me anything and I am grateful to be able to play these two games from my Sega Saturn collection without a hitch but for the love of god why, why this silence for all these years.<br /><br />I don't speak Japanese but what does it matter when you can't submit any type of feedback at all.<br /><br />Except for SSF and bgb I have switched all my emulators to open sourced ones today and I must say it feels great.<br />So much easier to follow the actual development, submit feedback, contribute etc. and you know what....you actually get a response.<br /><br />I have been following Yabause lately and I must say it starts to grow on me, maybe in a couple of years it might even be better then SSF.
