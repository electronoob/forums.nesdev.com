It depends on the situation-- tepples was just coming at it speculatively, I think, but the kind of stipulations <span class="posthilit">you</span> get in <span class="posthilit">a</span> lot of work contracts very often take explicit ownership of stuff like this, and depending on the company it could be <span class="posthilit">a</span> huge risk to try and <span class="posthilit">do</span> stuff like this on the clock. (Under <span class="posthilit">a</span> lot of contracts, it's <span class="posthilit">a</span> risk to <span class="posthilit">do</span> this kind of stuff at home too. Last time I was looking <span class="posthilit">for</span> <span class="posthilit">a</span> job, I turned down an otherwise decent offer because they wanted ownership of my creative output at home as well as at work.
