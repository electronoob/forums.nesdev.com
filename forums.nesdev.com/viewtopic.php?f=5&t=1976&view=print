<br />How does the mapper work, and what's the justification for creating a custom mapper?
<br />
<br />EDIT: Okay, this might seem like another misplaced topic, but as my sig says, I'm not a developer yet and probably won't be for ...a little while <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> (considering how tough <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology" class="postlink">Caltech</a> is). This is mainly a "philosophical" question; that is, the second half of the question is the most important to me.

<br />
<br />The mapper consists of the following:
<br />* Two 8-bit PCM channels with 12-bit frequency and 4-bit volume controls, using 256-byte FIFO buffers to contain the sample data (refilled once per frame) - without these, the game would have no sound effects or music (since DPCM is too poor quality and only handles one sound, and RAW PCM is out of the question)
<br />* MMC5-style attribute table expansion for <em>both</em> nametables - with only one nametable worth (like the MMC5 has), scrolling would be a major pain; without it at all, the game's graphics simply would not work (since the levels are divided into 3x3 tile blocks, incompatible with normal attribute tables)
<br />* 15-bit M2-based IRQ counter - simple enough. Could've made it a scanline timer, but this was easier.
<br />* Selectable mirroring (H, V, S0, S1)
<br />* SRAM with write protection
<br />* 256KB PRG ROM, with one swappable bank at $8000-$BFFF ($C000-$FFFF hardwired to last bank)
<br />* 32KB CHR ROM, with four 2KB swappable banks.
<br />
<br />If you need to know exactly how it works, you can grab a copy of the Nintendulator mapper DLL sources and look at src/unif/unl/unl_dripgame.c
<br />
<br />It should also be noted that I actually implemented this mapper in Quartus II (FPGA design software) before implementing it in software, just to force myself to keep it "simple". Kevtris has also implemented this mapper in his FPGA console and, from what I've heard, it works nicely.

<br />The expansion sound you described looks very similar to the GBA's two PCM channel. Am I correct ? Will the sound mixer be written in 6502 assembly or is there some co-processor in your mapper ? Do you use the extra famicom sound pin (or expansion port on modified NES units) ?

<br />
<br />Sound <em>mixer</em>? It sounds like you don't understand how this works - the mapper has two <strong>independent</strong> sound channels, each with a 256-byte FIFO buffer which is filled by writes from the CPU and emptied by a 12-bit 'period' timer. Each channel also has a 4-bit volume control (done using a multiplier), and their outputs are combined using a 12-bit adder. Said 13-bit signal will then get fed into a DAC which will go to the Famicom cart connector's sound pin (which will likely need to be redirected to the expansion port on an NES).

<br />Technical carateristic of the GBA sound can be found <a href="http://belogic.com/gba/" class="postlink">here</a>. What you described seems really similar to GBA's direct sound channels.

<br />
<br />That's not how I did it - by having two separate channels, I can play two sound samples at once (I determined that two samples at once was enough) without having to do <strong>any</strong> mixing. If I was doing mixing in software, the CPU would be &gt;70% utilized and I'd have no time left for the game itself.

<br />Sorry, I was too much exited about that mixing thing. You could also use a PIC to do the mixing for you, but I assume this is too expensive and that your game doesn't need that.
<br />So then, you just found yourself with 2 aditionnal custom waveform channels. 
<br />You may use pulse-width modulation effects to obtain cool sound effects (just a suggetion), as discussed with Memblers in the other sound thread.

<br />
<br />The original Drip game used four 8-bit PCM channels with 6-bit volume controls (i.e. the Paula chip) - I simply decided that 2 channels and 4-bit volume controls were sufficient. I'm not exactly certain what you mean by pulse-width modulation, but I'm pretty sure I won't be using it in this game.
<br />
<br />For the record, when I eventually get around to making a cartridge for this game, the mapper will be housed inside a small FPGA which will be loaded on powerup from a serial EEPROM. Depending on the FPGA I end up using, I might end up having to put the sound buffers on an external 512-byte RAM and use a state machine internally to dual-port it (this is exactly what kevtris had to do when he implemented this mapper on his FPGA-NES).

<br />Since you'll be stick with 256 step looped waveforms (as is my undestanging), you could have a rectangle wave but vary the duty cycle progressivly by making the high state taking one step more than the low sate every few frame, and vice versa once the whole buffer has been switched. This create an easy interesting effect. Here you are how it looks graphically :
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">_<br />&nbsp;_______<br />&nbsp;<br />__<br />&nbsp; ______<br />&nbsp; <br />___<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;_____<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />____<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ____<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />_____<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;___<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />______<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; __<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />_______<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;_<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;_______<br />_<br /><br />&nbsp; ______<br />__<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;_____<br />___<br /><br />etc...</div>
<br />Of course it is up to you, but it won't hurt, as long as you can change the content of the 256 byte waveform without silencing it.

<br />
<br />Then you still don't understand it properly. The sound hardware I designed has <em>no</em> restriction on waveform length. The "buffer" retains only the <strong>next 256 samples</strong> to be played - as each sample gets output, it is <em>removed from the buffer</em> to make room for more data. Every frame or so, the program writes more sound samples into the buffer so it won't run out and silence itself.
<br />
<br />Perhaps a diagram will help to explain how it works:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Play sound sample &quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot; into a 16-byte sample buffer<br />&#40;in reality, sound samples range from 231 bytes to 44,132 bytes, and the sound buffer is 256 samples long&#41;<br /><br />Frame 0:<br />&#91;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#93;<br />Fill buffer with as much sound data that fits<br />&#91;abcdefghijklmnop&#93;<br /><br />Frame 1: Given the playback frequency, 7 samples have been output<br />&#91;hijklmnop&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#93;<br />Fill it back up with as many samples as will fit<br />&#91;hijklmnopqrstuvw&#93;<br /><br />Frame 2: Another 7 samples get output<br />&#91;opqrstuvw&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#93;<br />Fill it up again, this time running out of data to put in.<br />&#91;opqrstuvwxyz&nbsp; &nbsp; &#93;<br />&#40;If this was a looped sample, it'd end up as<br />&#91;opqrstuvwxyzabcd&#93;&#41;<br /><br />Frame 3: Another 7 samples get output<br />&#91;vwxyz&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#93;<br />No more data to insert, though<br /><br />Frame 4: The sound channel attempts to output another 7 samples, but it only gets 5, and then the channel automatically goes silent.<br />&#91;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#93;</div>
<br />
<br />I did not design this sound hardware to be similar to what is used on any other system - my only concern was to allow playing arbitrary-length 8-bit PCM samples with minimal interaction from the CPU, in order to maximize the amount of CPU time I have available for the rest of the game code.
