		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello
<br />
<br />At the risk of sounding like an idiot and getting told to read the sticky, I just want to point out that I'm so new that a lot of what is in the sticky doesn't make sense to me either. There are tons of acronyms and I don't even know what they're talking about. 
<br />
<br />I'm coming at this from the opposite end that a lot of people on this forum seem to be coming from (at least from the threads that I have poked into). It seems most people here are trying to create new games but I am trying to understand the code of existing games. 
<br />
<br />I actually did program once in some assembly for the x86 in a class in college 10 years ago but it was only one semester and programming was only part of the class. It was basically a class on understanding microprocessor architecture and we spent most of the time on the hardware side. So basically I understand the concept but even my teacher said that most people who program in assembly end up in the loony bin.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> 
<br />
<br />Any help on resources to read or learning what the heck I'm doing would be beneficial. 
<br />
<br />Thanks!

<br />In my opinion, doing the later can be pretty hard if you can't do the former. 
<br />
<br />If you want to do minor edits to existing games, reading about the CPU and PPU will get you started, but understanding what each command does without understanding the basic concepts of what makes a game tick, you'll not go very far disassembling games. You probably know how unfriendly disassembled code can be (no labels, comments and so on), so it might not be the best thing to study.
<br />
<br />You said you wanted to understand the code of existing games, but what are you trying to accomplish exactly? Do you want to hack games? Study commercial games to learn how to make your own some day? Depending on what you want, we'll probably have different suggestions for you.

<br />Ah, sorry about that. I am interested in hacking existing NES games. I may someday spin out into more of the hardware and learn how to create cartridges but for now I figured that I'd start on the software side. You see I just got back into playing my NES and I have loved playing it again and now I would like to see what I can do with the hack concept. I figured that I'd start with some classics that have been done before and work my way up to doing my own. However, I really know nothing aobut hacking is done, I just have a vague idea of how it works conceptually.
<br />
<br />If you think that creating some basic games is a good first step then that is fine. I just want to know how to get started and what resources people use. Since everyone had to start somewhere I figure that there should be a lot of great experience from people who have already done this especially since there is no set "method" for this so there should be lots of perspectives. 
<br />
<br />I thank you in advance for any help.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Even if your goal isn't to make your own game, grabbing a NES programming tutorial or two and working through them can really get you up to speed on the basics of how the NES works and how the CPU talks to the other parts.  You'll learn how to find the RESET code, how to read joypads, how to communicate with the Audio Processing Unit (APU) and Picture Processing Unit (PPU)).  Then once you have the basics down you can start tracing through code in your favorite games and you'll recognize stuff like "aha, they are reading the joypads here" or "aha, STA $2007.  They are doing something with graphics here".
<br />
<br />romhacking.net is also a place you should check out.  Read their newbie text documents and you can learn lots of tricks on how to find data (text, palettes, graphics data, etc) in the ROMs.  Knowing where stuff is located in the ROM can help you set up the right breakpoints in your emulator/debugger, so you can know what code you want to be looking at.
<br />
<br />edit: and as you're learning this stuff, ask any questions you have here on the newbie forum.  I found the folks here to be extremely patient and helpful when I was first starting out.

<br />The first game that I want to take a look at is the original Super Mario Bros. I know it's been done a gazillion times before but that's why I want to look at it. I'm hoping that there may be some guides out there just for that game and maybe by comparing the source to what other people have done I may be able to get a greater understanding of things. 
<br />
<br />Any info on that side of things would be appreciated as well.

<br />Though SMB1 is a fairly simple/small game, and it has been disassembled a lot, I don't know if this would be the best place to start. I'm pretty sure all of the code is hyper-optimized, so it may not be easy to comprehend without studying it really hard.
<br />
<br />If you're looking into hacking existing ROMs, you first want to start out knowing how to communicate with the NES. To do this, you should make some moving sprite demos, scrolling demos, audio demos, etc. NESTech by Y0shi is a great reference for what writes to all the registers do. It covers pretty much all the PPU stuff you'd have to know to work with a game like SMB1. Brad Taylor's sound documentation is pretty much the one that taught me everything (after reading it over and over and over and experimenting, however). I'm pretty sure since the time I read this, other sound documents have been released, but I'm not so sure.
<br />
<br />And of course, you'll want to learn 6502. Many people are overwhelmed when trying to learn this language, probably because they don't learn it in a sort of most important to least important manner. Google GBAGuy's NES tutorials. If you can't find them, I think I have them somewhere. Many people say these tutorials are just plain bad, and it's partially true, but really not in another sense. The part where they are bad is in their accuracy of information. Lots of the example code is sloppy and unreliable, and some of the information the author claims to "not know if it's true or not". But really, these tutorials gave me such a boost into NESDev. They teach you some fundamental stuff about 6502 and about the NES as well. So you should take a look at them, but know that the information could be inaccurate (it's usually slightly inaccurate; it's rarely like completely false, made up crap).
<br />
<br />Also, some good (maybe a bit technical) 6502 resources:
