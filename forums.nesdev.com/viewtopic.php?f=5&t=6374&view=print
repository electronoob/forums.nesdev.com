<br />
<br />Doesn't look like Banshaku's a fan, but you're probably in the minority of console owners worldwide, considering it's on track to break overall sales records set by the PS2.  I'm not sure why anyone would think Nintendo "fell" at all.  If you're disappointed that you can't play the latest Splinter Cell on it, that's not Nintendo's failing, that's the developers who bet on the wrong system and have lost a lot of money as a result.
<br />
<br />The current HD game development model is not sustainable.  It used to be that a game that sold a million copies was a huge success; now they have to sell that many just to break even.  On the Wii, costs are still low, and many developers have found success there despite selling a hundred thousand units or less.

With MotionPlus, the Wii remote has the exact same functions as the bulb thing (Move?) except for the EyeToy-like functionality of showing video of the user.  Current tech demos are impressive, just like any unreleased device, but it's highly debatable that they'll come up with any gameplay possibilities that the Wii can't do just as reliably.
<br />
<br />One thing Sony hasn't been shy about is using two bulb controllers, one in each hand, for better overall sensing of the user's position.  This would be just as possible with two Wii remotes, it's just that nobody's done it yet.
<br />
<br />Red Steel 2 is pretty fun, but the true demonstration of what the MotionPlus does for you comes from Wii Sports Resort, which has some really nice implementations.  In fact most of Sony's demos have been of Wii Sports Resort games, stuff like swordfighting and archery.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just think that the motion controlling "fad" is now dying and Sony/MS are betting on the wrong horse. I'm not jumping on that bandwagon at all.
<br />
<br />The Wii is fine for my 3 year old kid and that's it.  If you look at all the games that came out on the Wii:
<br />
<br />- Only Nintendo games are selling
<br />- 3rd party ones are mostly failing 
<br />- Most of the software are shovelware
<br />
<br />The Wii is a fad. Only Nintendo is making money out of it and now it's going down.  There not making (Nintendo) anything original anymore. This is how I personally see it. People bought it because it was "the cool thing to do" like the ipod frenzy thing. Same thing for the DS. Most software is now shovelware and Nintendo is claiming piracy for the cause of lack of sale.
<br />
<br />The fact that it was cheaper and more affordable for everyone is a good thing compared to the latest from Sony and Microsoft and I do agree with that. I don't say that better graphic means better game. This is not my point. My point is that motion controller are a fad: we don't need that in most case. It's a fun distraction at the beginning and get on your nerve on the end.
