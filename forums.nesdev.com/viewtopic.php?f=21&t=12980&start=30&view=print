It worked great for some things but had some big issues for me. One was that you couldn't arrange your metasprites first and then delete duplicates. Another was that it didn't export metasprite data in a form that was useful for me.

Thank you for that!<br /><br />So are blank tiles in the metasprite just 0s until the next metasprite begins?<br /><br />Something that I figured out, that may be helpful to others, is the way NES ST translates 4-bit grayscale to 2-bit NES palette colors. It seems almost random at first, but it assigns them like this: (these are color numbers)<br /><br />4-bit   2-bit<br />Input   Output<br />  0    =       0<br />  1     =      1<br />  2      =     2<br />  3     =      3<br />  4      =     0<br />  5       =    1<br />  6         =  2<br />  7      =     3<br />  8     =      0<br />  9     =      1<br />  10    =     2<br />  11    =     3<br />  12    =     0<br />  13    =     1<br />  14     =    2<br />  15     =    3<br /><br /><br />So, I saved a swatch for color 0, color 5, color 10, and color 15, so that I would have choices which were distinguishable from one another.

Their developer Martin Korth has mentioned code generation inefficiencies of &quot;HLL&quot; (that is, C or C++) code in GBATEK, the reference that accompanies NO$GBA. (And the most common abbreviation for assembly language is asm, not asy.)<br /><br />This is what a makefile does:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">obj/snes/kitten.chrgb: tilesets/kitten.png<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tools/pngtochr --format gb tilesets/kitten.png obj/snes/kitten.chrgb</div><br />This means &quot;The file kitten.chrgb in the obj/snes folder can be created from the file kitten.png in the tilesets folder by running the command <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">tools/pngtochr --format gb tilesets/kitten.png obj/snes/kitten.chrgb</tt>.&quot; This way you can specify how to run the conversion tool on each file.<br /><br />Make also allows wildcard rules:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">obj/snes/%.chrsfc: tilesets/%.png<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tools/pngtochr --format snes $&lt; $@</div><br />This means &quot;Files in the obj/snes folder named (something).chrsfc can be created from the corresponding file in the tilesets folder named (something).png by running the command <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">tools/pngtochr --format snes</tt> followed by the first source file path and the target file path.<br /><br />If one file has has <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.include</tt> or <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.incbin</tt> directives that refer to another file, you specify multiple dependencies:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">obj/snes/graphics.o: src/graphics.s obj/snes/kitten.chrgb obj/snes/yarnball.chrsfc<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ca65 $&lt; -o $@</div><br />This means &quot;The file graphics.o in the obj/snes folder can be created from the file graphics.s in the tilesets folder, the file kitten.chrgb in the obj/snes folder, and the file yarnball.chrsfc in the obj/snes folder by running the command <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">ca65</tt> followed by the first source file path followed by <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">-o</tt> followed by the target file path.&quot;<br /><br />Then when you run Make, it'll build a map of what depends on what, find what's up to date and what's out of date based on last modification time, and determine in which order the programs need to be run to build your project. For example, if it has to build kitten.chrgb and yarnball.chrsfc before building graphics.o, it'll do so.
