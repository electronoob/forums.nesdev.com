I tried argumenting back (with definitions of vector graphics and even explained how its done in Elite game), but not to avail.<br />He agreed for me to ask the real NES specialists here.<br />So, a question, &quot;can NES do vector graphics?&quot;<br />Thanks for any answers.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There's a difference between a vector display and vector graphics. A vector display is a specific kind of hardware. Vector graphics are graphics made with vector primitives rather than pixels or some other kind. You can render vector graphics with pixels on a raster display (e.g.: SVG graphics in your web browser, adobe flash, Elite on the NES, etc.).<br /><br />This is all just semantics though. &quot;Vector graphics&quot; might be taken to mean &quot;vector display&quot; and vice versa depending on the context. Words are imprecise. I find it's usually more productive to ask someone what they mean rather than guess which definition they like best.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Rainwarrior maeks a good point about SVG, which stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. I'm inclined to agree with deferring to the name of the SVG standard. SVGs are <strong>vector graphics rasterized at runtime,</strong> and so are the graphics in <em>Elite</em>, <em>Tank Demo</em>, <em>Faceball</em>, <em>Qix</em>, and <em>Star Fox</em>.<br /><br />However, I'd draw the line on that side of <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>, <em>Uniracers</em>, and <em>Toy Story</em>. The graphics in those games are created from vector graphics, but their rasterization is baked into the cartridge. Once the CPU sees them, they're not at all vectors. I'm not entirely sure what's vectors and what's prerendered in <em>Out of This World</em> and <em>Flashback</em> though.

But yeah, I imagine you could change CHR RAM by some external means and it would run just fine. What kind of outputs does the Neo Geo have? I mean, if it has some sort of an expansion port, could you do a hack job where you run a cord from the expansion port to the modified cartridge.

Also, you're saying this can all be done on the cartridge? If so, the statement that it's impossible to do have CHR RAM on the Neo Geo seems a bit inaccurate.
