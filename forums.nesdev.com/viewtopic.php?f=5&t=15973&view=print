		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I see. I haven't noticed it, but it might be that straightforward platformers are easy to explain and sell. You can focus on the theme or identity in your salespitch, rather than getting 'nerdy' with mechanics, designs and elements. Compare with, say hypothetically, a stealth-based top-down cooperative escape game for two. It might bring more variety to the platform, but will it attract enough people?

Years ago, it was <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=5927" class="postlink">single screen-osis</a>.<br /><br />One thing making platformers the flavor of the year for <em>Action 53</em> volume 3 is that a platformer fits easily in the technical requirements.<br /><br /><ul><li><strong>Game size: 512 kbit</strong><br />Platformers' level geometry constraints make it more practical to compress more gameplay into a smaller space without making maps as repetitive as those of the first <em>Legend of Zelda</em>. (If only <em>Cat Quest</em> hadn't been canceled...) In addition, side view allows storing only those cels needed for one facing direction.</li><li><strong>Work RAM: Not available</strong><br />In a platformer, a four- or eight-way scrolling engine and long-term memory of destroyed areas are less necessary.</li><li><strong>Input: Standard NES controller</strong><br />Simulations are more convenient with a mouse, and interactive fiction is more convenient with a keyboard, but platformers are more convenient with a controller.</li><li><strong>Save type: Password</strong><br />Platformers don't usually have a lot of state to save from one play session to the next. In an overhead adventure or RPG, you have to save things like cash in wallet, inventory, event flags, and experience. </li><li><strong>Effort scale: Hobby, not day job</strong><br />It takes time to draw animation cels. A side view game needs only one set of animation frames, not three or five sets, one for each facing direction.</li></ul><br />Even games released outside the competition still feel some of these requirements. To make development practical, a game has to target the intersection of those features available in debugging emulators and those features available in reproduction cartridges that are affordable to manufacture. &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory)" class="postlink">Intersection</a>&quot; means that if a feature isn't available in both, it can't be used. Last I checked, battery-backed WRAM was fairly expensive to add to a cartridge, prompting a <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=64073#p64073" class="postlink">search for alternatives</a>, and save to the first flash sectors (as in <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/UNROM_512" class="postlink">RetroUSB's 4 Mbit oversize UxROM</a>) wasn't in FCEUX. Has this changed since 2010 or thereabouts?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">TmEE wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Some nice Contra like run'n'gun would be great ~</div><br />Except:<br /><br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>A run-and-gun game would still be a &quot;platformer&quot;.</li><li>Look at how detailed the animations in popular 1990s run-and-guns like <em>Gunstar Heroes</em> and <em>Metal Slug</em> are.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />We made a deliberate choice to target the NES rather than just making a PC game, whether due to nostalgia or other reasons, so those reasons probably affect the games we make. I wouldn't be surprised if people who came here after a childhood of playing famous games like Mario, Mega Man, Metroid, Contra and such ended up taking inspiration from those sorts of games.

And if you went with today's 64GB SD cards, that's enough for 38 hours of 2bpp uncompressed video.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My much bigger gripe was how difficult it would be to fit everything in vram on the SNES, which is why I devised my idea of having every sprite have its own slot and identical sprites using the same slot for basically perfect space usage. However, you don't even have to deal with this on the NES.

The NES can copy about eight tiles to the PPU per frame, plus OAM and whatever map updates are required for scrolling. Unlike the NES, the GBC has HDMA to CHR RAM at one tile per scanline.</li><li><strong>CHR ROM juxtaposition lockout</strong><br />You might work around lack of CHR RAM bandwidth by using CHR ROM instead. But tons of animation frames might get stuck in the CHR ROM because frames for four other objects being displayed are already switched into PPU $1000, $1400, $1800, and $1C00. Unlike the NES, the Neo Geo has more than 8 sprite tile number bits in each OAM entry and many more address lines for CHR ROM.</li><li><strong>Sprite flicker</strong><br />The NES allows sprites to cover 25% of a scanline. The PPU will refuse to touch tons of animation frames if other large sprites are in front of them. Unlike the NES, the GBC has 50% sprite coverage.</li></ol><br />Animating many distinct, large, horizontally aligned sprites without flicker would require hardware compositing of tile data to the background CHR stream fed to the PPU. That'd be the NES counterpart to a SuperGrafx second VDC or a Super FX GSU. If you think such a compositor would fit in an affordable CPLD, I'd be interested to read your new topic explaining how. In addition, the developer would have to hire programmers who know, or train programmers in, several technologies: C++, FCEUX's code base, Verilog, the obsolete Xilinx IDE used to develop PowerPak mappers for daily play testing on hardware, and an up-to-date CPLD IDE used to develop the production mapper. This is probably far beyond &quot;Effort scale: Hobby, not day job&quot;.<br /><br />And a run-and-gun would still be...<br /><br />a platformer!
