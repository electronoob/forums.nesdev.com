		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Multiplexing has little to do with it. Even the non-multiplexed 6502 needs a half cycle to generate each address. A 6502 family CPU divides the CPU cycle into low and high halves. An address is ready by the start of the high half, and the data has to be ready by the end.<br /><br />If it helps, think of each 65816 cycle as two cycles, address generation and memory access, because other CPUs like Z80 and 68000 that allow a whole cycle for memory access tend to be clocked faster to compensate for their lower IPC. If you put a divide by 2 in front of a 65816's clock input, that'd correspond to an &quot;internal operation&quot; cycle after each memory access. And just as the Amiga used the 68000's copious &quot;internal operation&quot; cycles for video, the Apple II used &quot;internal operation&quot; half-cycles for video.</div><br /><br /> The Huc6280 in the TG16 (65x variant) doesn't require a half cycle. 120ns rom runs all day with no problems on the 7.159mhz bus access of the cpu. If Hudson could pull that off (NEC didn't design any of the three main chips), then surely the Big N could have as well. And the PC-Engine came out before the SNES (2 years before IIRC).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The address bus is only guaranteed to be correct by the time φ2 rises, but in practice the transitions happen very shortly after the start of φ1. Most ROMs' /OE-to-data time is half that of their /CE-to-data time, so as long as /CE is only derived from the address bus on the TG16 (and not M2), I would think a plain 120ns ROM should work fine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think they should've ran the CPU and PPU on a synchronized 32-bit bus with cartridge pinouts, and 128kB of shared RAM.  The only downside would be screen resolution being tied to CPU speed and ROM latency, but other than that, it would be so much more flexible.  It would be able to fetch sprite patterns directly from the ROM, without any complicated sprite management, and will be better equipped for enhancement chips.

Think of it as an SNES's 65816 sharing the same data and address bus as the Sega Genesis's VDP, with alternating half cycles, with &quot;slow ROM&quot; being used with 32H mode, and &quot;fast ROM&quot; being used with 40H mode.
