		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello nesdevvers, 
<br />
<br />I'm a starter at bending hardware and glitching out video/audio signals using whatever kind of way I can find without breaking my machines. 
<br />I started looking this stuff up for a schoolproject, where I want to create a bent NES that can still be played, but where they player can also play around with the world in which the game is set. (and thus choose to make his own setting)
<br />
<br />So to get this working I had to start bending more than just Casio keyboards and start on a game console. I took my old NES off the shelve and got myself a _brand new_ game genie (it was still wrapped in the original plastic, only 2 years younger than myself), as I heard this allows you to change around code sent from game to CPU/PPU without having to mess with the hardware. 
<br />
<br />So where I am now, is I'm trying to figure out how this Game Genie thing works, exactly. I'm working this on an actual unmodded old NES, my equally old Super Mario Bros. 3 and a Game Genie, so all of this is on original hardware. 
<br />I have a reference table for the game genie to rework letters to binary/hex values, but I'm stuck with a couple of questions. 
<br />
<br /><strong>First off</strong>, am I calculating right? I'm using the reftable at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/nesgg.txt">http://nesdev.com/nesgg.txt</a><!-- m --> to rework codes. 
<br />I have SMB3 in my slot atm, and using PEUZUGAA (start at lvl2) I reworked this to:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">cheat code = PEUZUGAA<br />ADDRESS&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0010110010110011<br />ADDRESS HEX&nbsp; &nbsp;$2CB3<br />VALUE&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;00000001 &#40;logically, changing this to 00000010 will send you to lvl3, that code would be ZEUZUGAA&#41;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Is this the right Hex address for this code? 
<br />
<br />Because; my second question is concerning those addresses. Am I correct in thinking that an adress of $2CB3 would be a sub of Name Table 3? Or of Attribute Table 2? Or doesn't it work like that? 
<br />This is from ref file <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://fms.komkon.org/EMUL8/NES.html#LABD">http://fms.komkon.org/EMUL8/NES.html#LABD</a><!-- m --> which I read as saying $2C00 - $2FC0 constitutes Name Table 3.
<br />
<br />And if I would input a different value in (for example) $2CB4 (or 0010110010110100) does that still fall under this same table? Will it also change something in the PPU's interpretation of the cartridge? 
<br />And so, can I rework a Hex value to binary and input something that makes sense into the NES? And to which Hex tables can I write? 
<br />
<br />I was under the impression that writing to attribute tables would make the NES output different things than usual, but if I try writing to $2C01 or anything else of the sort (or $2000, $2400, $2800 and higher) nothing really happens and mario just starts where he always does. 
<br />How do I know which attribute table to write to? 
<br />
<br />My third and last question for this topic is on reference bits. 
<br />First, the subject of bit 3-3, the reference bit for checking the length of the code (briefly touched in above mentioned ref file)
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">note char 3 bit 3 is used by the game genie to determine the length<br />of the code.<br /></div>
<br />Does this value always have to be 1 for the Genie to do its magic? Or can it be 0? And why is it one or the other? I get that this bit won't actually change anything, I'm just curious on how it works. 
<br />
<br />And secondly, how do the reference bits in 8-char codes work? I've seen that the are all written 0 in most of the codes. Actually all 8-char codes in my game genie booklet for SMB3 end in AA, or 00000000 for all reference bits. I can write AE to it (or 00001000) which changes the value of '5', but if I write anything else it breaks my game. Anyone that can explain that one?
<br />
<br />
<br />First post, long post. Thanks in advance for any and all ideas and help you guys can provide. Tho keep in mind that I'm not a coder, please keep it simple for a simple mind like mine ^^
<br />
<br />
<br />Thanks, 
<br />
<br />JasonD

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I came up with another one. 
<br />
<br />I'm translating my HEX to binary. For instance, $2004 would be 0010000000000100, which is 16 chars. However, all the reference codes I find are only 15 chars for adress (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO) 
<br />
<br />I start working my way back from the O to the A through the table, but that means the first char falls off. Is this the write way to rework the code to the game genie? 
<br />
<br />for example, writing a value of 00000000, this would become 
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">|1678|H234|-IJK|LABC|DMNO|5EFG|<br />|0000|0000|1000|0010|0100|0000|<br />|&nbsp; A |&nbsp; A |&nbsp; E |&nbsp; Z |&nbsp; G |&nbsp; A |<br /></div>
<br />Is this a correct calculation?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />2CB3 isn't the address, the address is ACB3.
<br />I'm guessing that they actually use the "most significant" bit to indicate whether the code has a compare value or not.  One setting has an 8-letter code that includes a compare value, the other setting has a 6-letter code without compare value, but both point at the same address.
<br />
<br />So it's like the address is always OR-ed with 8000.
<br />I don't think a game genie will mess with the "cartridge RAM area" of 6000-7FFF, even for the few games that map ROM there.

<br />Does that limit me in adjusting the game? (specifically for graphics)

Some ASM skill needed here, but if you can use a cheat finder, you can find out interesting RAM addresses, then set data breakpoints for those.  Then change the asm code to something else.
<br />
<br />I've gotten into creating my own Game Genie codes, for example, I made a few codes for Dragon Warrior 4 to remap the "Try Out" AI control mode into "You control the party" mode, then let you re-enable AI control as well.
<br />
<br />And 8000-FFFF is always the ROM, not RAM.  0000-07FF is the system RAM, and 6000-7FFF is cartridge RAM found on some games.
<br />
<br />If you just want to screw up the graphics, then let the game sit out and get all dusty <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />This is going to be a newbie question, but how would a cheat finder work? Is that a programme that can read ROM in/outs from your emulator? 
<br />I can read binary/hex values, or have been able to read and calculate most of it so far. (apart from missing the $8000 <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> )
<br />I'm thinking if I know what to edit, I can make it work. I just have no clue what a cheat finder would look like <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> 
<br />
<br />
<br />I've gotten a few funky effects btw, on mario:
<br /><img src="http://7th-studios.net/img/SMB3_mario1.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://7th-studios.net/img/SMB3_mario2.png" alt="Image" />
<br />And on the worldmap. Unfortunately, Mario is somewhere off-screen, stuck in nothingness, and unable to select a level. I would've LOVED to see what a level looks like in this style ^^
<br /><img src="http://7th-studios.net/img/SMB3_worldhack.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />
<br />Btw, screwing up the dusty cartridges is the next step. I have a NES sliced and gutted, ready to get circuit-bent. I'm not going to sacrifice my SMB3 for that tho. 
<br />The cartridge marked for death-by-bending is poor old Bayou Billy. (srsly, screw Billy <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> )

<br />
<br />Anyway, a cheat finder lets you search for values in RAM that have changed a particular way.  For example, you search ram for the number of lives remaining, and you find it after you die several times.  Then you set a data breakpoint on that value, so the debugger stops at the code that takes away a life.  Replace the DEC or STA or whatever instruction it uses with some NOPs and you have infinite lives.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, what Dwedit said it good.  So you probably can use a normal cheat finder to find and test stuff (or maybe even Game Action Replay codes), but then you'll have to back up bit and find the opcode in ROM that's effecting the change.  That requires minimal proficiency in 6502 assembly, you can get help with that around here.
<br />
<br />The Game Genie, however can only patch 3 bytes of ROM.  I seem to remember someone had chained 2 of them together and it worked, but I could be wrong.
<br />
<br />What could be fun is to change what rights to the $4001 and $4005 registers.  That would change the audio a lot by enabling frequency sweeps.  In fact, if you play most Capcom games with a Game Genie, this already happens.  Because GG uses the sweep regs, and Capcom didn't initialize them.

No debugger emus for that, so either I have to install windows, or find another way to read out those codes to find ones that affect the game.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> 
<br />Any suggestions for a mac user? The Emu I'm using atm is Nestopia, but it has no debug option.
<br />&gt; 
<br />I downloaded NESICIDE2 and Nintendulator, the first one for mac, the latter for Win. Going to play with that, but from what I understand NESICIDE is a writing/compiling tool, and not an emu/debugger?
<br />
<br />I read some codes on the forum here that affect the sound in my SMB3 as well, a code like KLOTOE, address would be $E811 ? 
<br />Can a GG change the writes to $4001 or $4005 in any way? Or will I _have_ to pull apart a rom for that and emulate it? 
<br />
<br />Cause the emus are very interesting to try and sort of reverse engineer this stuff, but eventually I want to use nothing but the original hardware.
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />That question goes for $4000-$4013, but maybe even moreso for $4014 or $2004, editing the sprites

<br />It's both...in fact it supports the type of breakpoints you'd want and more.  Still very much a work in progress, but let me know if there's things you want for debugging and I'll do what I can.  I don't have a mac so can't do mac builds, but others among us [hyarion] can.
