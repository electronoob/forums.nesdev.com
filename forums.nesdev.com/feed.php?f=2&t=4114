If you plan to eventually port a level editor to DS, GP2X, or Pandora so that it can be used on the go, I wouldn't recommend C# for those cases either. Heck, even a Windows Mobile device struggles to run assemblies for the .NET Compact Framework.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Tue May 20, 2008 6:15 am</p><hr />

For application programming I would recommend C# over both C++ and VB.NET. It's fast and east to create GUI application in it, and it have a C++ like dialect so it's pretty easy to get started with if you have worked with C++ before. The support from MS through MSDN is great too. And DirectX in C# is pretty nice too.<br /><br />I wrote a Level editor with support for meta tiles and multiple layers and what else in C# with fancy GUI for a mobile project in like two weeks (most of the time went for making things like dockable windows :P)<br /><br />But for games I would still pick C++ as I like to have direct control of memory and things like that :)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=15">dXtr</a> — Tue May 20, 2008 5:43 am</p><hr />

If it is professional or not depends on how well you do it though. You can be professional with VB. And as you said since it's just creating data for the NES program which is the focus, it isn't a big deal if people dislike VB. <br /><br />Though C++ and Allegro are not hard at all. :p<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Mon May 19, 2008 4:53 pm</p><hr />

C++ is not such a big deal, the problem is learning how to work with Allegro. I must agree that with VB I'd get a much better editor in very little time. Since it's just a tool (that will not be of much use after the game is done - unless people want to hack the game), I'll probably pick that. Just tried the portable edition, it works great.<br /><br />I know this is not the most professional solution, but I don't have the time to waste on mastering Allegro or getting used to C++. Thanks for the suggestions though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon May 19, 2008 2:50 pm</p><hr />

Learning C++ is kind of a task. But VB has a very simple language, and the program does a lot of coding for you.

Well I'm going to make an editor in Visual Basic once I learn a few more things. It's really simple for making nice-looking programs.<br /><br />But yeah, otherwise you could make a NES ROM editor that keeps the data in SRAM. That's what I've done before. And when I suggest that, I DON'T mean using it on the actual NES, because that's a waste of time, because in the end it's just supposed to give you data on your computer that you can incbin into your game.<br /><br />If you don't feel you have time to write a simple application, then I think you'll have to do .db statements. However, you can design your levels on paper like Bregalad said, and enter them in as .db statements. Also, you can enter them in in a way you could understand and edit more easily, and then have a simple NES program rearrange the data to be interleaved like you want it to be.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Mon May 19, 2008 11:22 am</p><hr />
