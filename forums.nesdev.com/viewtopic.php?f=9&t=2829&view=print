		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just dug my PAL nes out of my loft, only to find that most of the games are missing and the light justs blinks on and off when I try to play Zelda 1. I <em>know</em> that this means that the connectors are most probably dirty, as I cannot seen any of the out of shape. What can I do to remedy this? I've tried blowing on the NES and cartridge connectors, but to no avail. Could it be down to the fact the NES has not been switched on for five or so years? If I need to open the NES to clean/change anything what could you recommend?

A few people have said slightly bending each of the 72 pins fixes it, I haven't tried that though.  I bought a new connector for mine, for $7 or so I think it was.
<br />
<br />This page has a walkthrough of it (mostly just taking the thing apart though, there's surely plenty of screws).  <a href="http://josh.kfoo.net/videogames/nes_repair/" class="postlink">http://josh.kfoo.net/videogames/nes_repair/</a>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That site recommends using metal polish, both on the motherboard's edge connector (to the 72-pin connector) and on cartridges, which, <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1203" class="postlink">as I seem to recall</a>, is probably the <em>worst</em> thing to use, since it will tend to strip off any protective coating from the connectors (i.e. tin plating on the motherboard, gold plating on the cartridges) and make them even <strong>more</strong> susceptible to corrosion.
<br />
<br />Isopropyl alcohol and cotton swabs is probably the best thing you can do for your cartridges, and cleaning the edge connector on the NES motherboard itself should be completely unnecessary since the 72-pin connector doesn't actually move around - all you need to clean (and bend pins on) is the part of the 72-pin connector that touches the cartridges.

<br />
<br />That walkthrough is nice, but it should be mentioned that you can slide the connector off without taking the "mainboard" out of the case!
<br />
<br />Also, you don't really need to put the RF shield back on when putting it back together, either.

<br />How necessary is that RF shield?  Are there any disadvantages to removing it?

<br />That is definitely a great thing to do. Just bend all pins on the top part (only 36 pins), because the bottom ones aren't acessible with some random tool, and the connector will grip more games, fixing most problems.

All of these systems run better than new, the blinking screen is completely eliminated as it is a result of the lock out chip.  I also don't push the carts down in the system as that bends the pins down much faster, meaning you'll have to go and bend the pins back that much quicker.  I just did this to one of my systems this weekend and gave it a nice black paint job to match a pair of Sharp NES TV controllers, pics are up on the technical and restoration forum over on digital press.
