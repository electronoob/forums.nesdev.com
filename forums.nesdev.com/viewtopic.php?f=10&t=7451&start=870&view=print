That moves it to the next nametable as the default that you then scroll within. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div><br />^thank you 3gengames, when I didn't care anymore and just followed your advice it resulted in being able to keep scrolling between nametable 1 and 2.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br />---<br /><br />Now my meandering remindes me of that gif that tepples posted that shows the game safely adding the next nametable collum by collum.  Is that how I should be coding now?   My goal is to safely scroll into the next new nametable.

Because the scroll position ($2000 and $2005) and the VRAM writing address ($2006) use the same variable inside the PPU, you need to rewrite that variable after you finish uploading nametable changes. Write the scroll position to $2005, write the upper bits of X and Y scroll, pattern table addresses, and sprite size to $2000, and turn rendering on in $2001.
