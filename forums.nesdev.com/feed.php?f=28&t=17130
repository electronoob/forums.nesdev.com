Hey everyone, new here and sorry if this is a stupid question. <br /><br />Im looking to translate some of my famicom carts to english as a hobby and wondering, is it really as simple as flashing a new eprom and replacing the original prg chip and wiring it in? Im specifically looking into doing the japanese version of shadowgate.<br /><br />In otherwords, taking the original prg chip out and placing an eprom with the english version of the rom back in. I know there are different wiring for different mappers but i see on the list its an mmc3 so im assuming i can follow some of these wiring diagrams from tutorials like the final fantasy 3 swap?<br /><br />Sorry if this is stupid, i want to get into this as a hobby and looking for advice on how to not screw up! <br /><br />Thanks for reading!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9036">Mrkunio</a> — Sat Mar 10, 2018 10:27 pm</p><hr />
