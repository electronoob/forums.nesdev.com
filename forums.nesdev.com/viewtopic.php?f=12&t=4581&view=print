<br />
<br />Well I know I am capable of this stuff. I just need to learn. The reason I don't know some of it yet is because I've been screwing around.
<br />
<br />
<br />So to conclude the body of this post I'll just say 35 byte sentence:
<br />I'd appreciate your help.
<br />
<br />(At least I thik that's twenty-five bytes.)

<br />Edit:

<br />Crap. This needs to be moved to "Newbie Help Center".
<br />Sorry about that.

<br />It's cool, that's more for NES anyways.
<br />
<br />SNES isn't Super Nintendo just in name, it's much like an enhanced NES.  It's PPU (graphics chip) is a lot more complex, but the CPU is much the same (and backwards-compatible).  The CPU you're looking for is 65816, but you're best bet may be to look at plain old 6502 assembly since there's lots of beginners guides on that.
<br />
<br />Compared to NES, it can be a lot of work to get an SNES program going (even when it's doing nothing, or "hello world", so grab something to start with.  neviksti's SNESdev starter kit should be good (I haven't used it). <a href="http://nesdev.com/SNES-starterkit.zip" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/SNES-starterkit.zip</a>

<br />
<br />Actually, The Atari 400/800 is the enhanced version of 5200. The one that is an enhanced Atari 2600 is really the 7800. (hence the 7800 and 2600 are the only two named ''Atari VCS'' in existence)

<br />Yeah, Discussing the Snes bein' an enhanced NES:
<br />I noticed the controllers are nearly the same thing. The snes pad would Be like Solid Snake if the Nes pad was Big Boss.
<br />I've never had a Snes pad shatter in my hands. (the hardware of those days seem more sturdy) But if it did happen I would yell "Controller? controller? Coooooooontrooooooooooler!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
<br />
<br />Now, before we get too 'Carried away' let's not talk about the Snes Being an enhanced Nes anymore. I know that it is.  I don't want the  thread having to be split. That's been getting pretty annoying. I've been getting pretty annoying to though. I'd better clean up my act before I get banned huh? Don't answer that, It was a rhetorical question.

You just have to make sure the memory map is correct. I don't think there are any step by step guides for SNES, you're better off with NES if you want that.
<br />
<br />So you might want to start off with the NES and get little issues figured out and step up to the SNES when you are better prepared. I think the SNES is easier to work with personally, but when you are starting out you should keep it simple and the NES has alot of help compared to very little with SNES.

<br />VERY TRUE!
<br />
<br />
<br />So how do I learn the 6502 Assembly language &amp; how to use it?
<br />I really want to start from the basics. Well almost.

<br />
<br />There are a lot of 6502 assembly programming books from the '70s and '80s, it'd be worth doing some occasional ebay searches (or anywhere else you can get lucky finding old books).
<br />
<br />Since computers themselves were new then, lots of these have to start at the basics.

<br />
<br /> I'm writing a step by step tutorial for coding on the PCE. The first two chapters are finished. It'll cover everything. The hardware at a basic and detailed look. The processor in greater detail for newbies and intermediates. The ins and outs of building a project with the assembler and using its directives/syntax. I'm also going to include examples so people can get their hands dirty without too much worry. 
<br />
<br /> There needs to be something like this for all these old consoles in my opinion.
