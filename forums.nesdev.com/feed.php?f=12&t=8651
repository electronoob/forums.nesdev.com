Just uploaded no$sns v1.3, <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/sns.htm">http://nocash.emubase.de/sns.htm</a><!-- m --><br />New features are Nintendo Super System (Arcade Cabinet) emulation, and support for some more controllers/add-ons: Barcode Battler (EAN-13 format only, the formats for EAN-8 and UPC-A are still unknown), Four Twin Taps (for 8 player quiz game), and the Pachinko dial (for utmost stupidity). All that bizarre features are available to people donating some money to the nocash project; money will be blown up on making more such strange stuff. Or, without donating, everybody can now download no$sns v1.2 for free - with equally bizarre features like SFC-Box emulation.<br /><br />For the game pad configuration - I've added a feature in no$sns v1.3 that prevents assigning the same PC gamepad to two different SNES joypads - I hope that will avoid problems/confusion in future.<br /><br />DOS version would be nice. But... the modern multisync monitors are so damn slow on switching from text to graphics mode - I think it would be a pain to use (and make/test) it. And not too sure if it'd be much faster than the windows version - the overall emulation speed should be same no matter of the OS - at its best, things like video output might be slightly faster.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5211">nocash</a> — Tue Aug 14, 2012 4:14 pm</p><hr />

I've donated to get access to v 1.2. I'm noticing that assigning buttons on an external game controller now works. However, the default values created a confusing problem for me. <br /><br />I have a SNES controller adapter with two ports. For whatever reason, I had the controller plugged into port 2. After assigning the buttons, I noticed (in for example Super Mario World, and later the SNES test program) that pressing one key on the pad pressed two different keys. The problem was that player 2's control were enabled and mapped to buttons 1-8 port 2. This is true even when "game controllers" is set to "one joypad". I think a safer bet for default values is to not assign any buttons, since they most likely won't end up on the button you want.<br /><br />If a button is unassigned, it's saved as 00 in the config string. It's then loaded as "button 89" and consequently saved as hex 59 in the config string. I guess this doesn't hurt, but is a bit ugly.<br /><br />I would suggest making the pad fully reassignable, including direction keys. You may want to to do this for various reasons.<br /><br />The VRAM viewers tile views (and sometimes BG4?) are showing complete junk data. <br /><br />The "stretching mode" setting does absolutely no difference in the two modes that I'm able to test, software and StretchDIBits. For example, software mode uses the blocky stretch mode, always, except in 50% zoom, where it uses resample mode, always.<br /><br />The stretch type (which is a bad name for the setting) DirectDraw doesn't work here. I'm guessing some piece of Win9x voodoo stopped working in newer operating systems. I suggest also supporting Direct3D, which works better for various reasons on hypermodern operating systems (Vista, 7).<br /><br />And finally, any chance of a DOS build of no$sns?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4548">nitro2k01</a> — Sun Jul 01, 2012 5:06 am</p><hr />

If each ending uses a game's script system, and there's a table of scripts, then a debugger could help find the table.<br /><br />For example, the ending of Thwaite assumes that at least one missile landed, and one of the characters investigates the wreckage and discovers who was the culprit.
