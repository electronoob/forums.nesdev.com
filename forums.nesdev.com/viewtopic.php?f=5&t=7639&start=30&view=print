<br />That's probably due to the weird fact that the NES (and System M/J generally) has non-square pixels. As computers usually use square pixels, 240 scan lines at a 3:4 aspect ratio gives 320 samples per line. Which happens to be QVGA. As a lot of EMUs scale their graphical output to QVGA (or another 3:4 size), it's not surprising that you see this sort of thing.

<br />Now for a recap

<br />I think I know how to get screenshots of the levels by extracting them from a YouTube speedrun of the Flash game. Then I could use some basic image processing to figure out which metatile is in each position. That would give me a collection of 20x15 grids, ready to rework into 16x14 grids for this project.

<br />Hah, I hadn't thought about that, sounds crazy enough to work. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> If you can get the screenshots for each level this way, I can do the post processing from that point onward (I have tools for optimizing the metatile sets etc etc). Also, I think it might be fine to use the 320x240 levels with horizontal scrolling for this. It's a little bit awkward yeah, but not too bad on the tests I've done.

<br />
<br />Very short short though, pretty much a 1 level demo. But nevertheless pretty cool... doubt it'd be even possible to adapt to the NES though with all the rotations of the playfield as part of the gameplay :)

<br />Possibly, I have been thinking about it, and I already got a multidirectional scrolling engine done, so...

<br />I took a quick look as well, there's a curious signature "CNC ARRAY" in some of them. Some googling led me to ClickTeam's forum, and then it hit me, CNC = Click 'n Create, i.e. one of those WYSIWYG game/multimedia tools. It looks like the game might have been made using one of the ClickTeam's tools, such as Multimedia Fusion (I didn't know it could produce SWF files until now).
<br />
<br />Shouldn't be too hard to figure out the format of that file.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Wasn't too hard indeed, seems to be like this:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">CNC ARRAY format<br />----------------<br /><br />signature: CNC ARRAY\0<br />unknown dword: 02 &#40;version number maybe?&#41;<br />dword: x dimension<br />dword: y dimension<br />dword: z dimension<br />dword: option flags<br />&nbsp; lowest two bits indicate the type: 1 = numeric array, 2 = text array<br />&nbsp; next bit is &quot;base 1 index&quot; flag<br />&nbsp; next bit is &quot;global to this application&quot; flag<br /><br />after that comes x*y*z ints<br /></div>
<br />
<br />EDIT: The Flash version is not made in Multimedia Fusion, maybe the level editor was (there are references to FlashPunk in the SWF, which is a Flash game engine).
