		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What would it take to make a cart out of a Family BASIC program?  It would seem to me that you'd need to take a snapshot of memory while the Family BASIC program is running and write a loader that dumps that memory state back into RAM.  Would the Family BASIC ROM still be needed for that?

You'll still need to hack it to make it autostart, since you're probably going to play on machines without keyboards.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That reminded me that I once came across a Japanese page with ROMs of games made with Family Basic. <a href="http://www2.tky.3web.ne.jp/~yosshin/famibe/my_works.html" class="postlink">Here it is.</a><br />Seems that the ROMs are just mapper 0 (Nestopia reports that they are nonstandard with 8kb video RAM) and I don't really know how he did it. There are some programming tips on his page but seems that he doesn't have any info on how to make these games into ROMs (and thus, standalone carts).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I took a brief look: They all require 4 KB of RAM, mapped in the standard place. It looks like he replaced most of the top 0x3000 bytes of the v3.0 Family BASIC ROM with a little stub that copies 4KB to RAM and automatically starts execution. If you disable RAM (by, say, using a NES2.0 header), you get an error from the Family BASIC internals.<br /><br />This does make a really easy test for me, however: I can use his game to construct an NROM-368 image and see if the game will error when it can't write to RAM: and the answer is yes, it needs writeable RAM. More extensive modifications would be necessary to avoid that.

As Family Basic saves codes to tapes, one easy way (i.e. no &quot;custom&quot; tool needed) is to just save a recording of the tape data to a wave file. As pretty much most modern emulators that support Family Basic could load tape recording with *.tp extension, that include at least Nestopia, NesterJ and VirtuaNES I think, with the latter two extremely popular in Japan for some reasons. You may then load the recording with an emulator and dump the memory, or make a save state and crop the appropriate memory range to grab the game data.

Although something similar was done recently for the Mattel Aquarius here:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://atariage.com/forums/topic/174191-aquarius-machine-language-programming-on-the-aquarius/page__st__25#entry2729165">http://atariage.com/forums/topic/174191 ... try2729165</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The difference (among other things) is that Aquarius .CAQ files are not waveforms.  Even compressed .WAV files would be prohibitively expensive to store on ROM..
