I'll play tepples for a moment: but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF#Uncompressed_GIF" class="postlink">not all GIFs</a> (animated or otherwise) use LZ77/LZW compression due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF#Unisys_and_LZW_patent_enforcement" class="postlink">patent debate</a>.  Sure, that patent expired in 2004, but there's really no way to guarantee every GIF file ever created is using compression, or that whatever was used to create a GIF present-day makes use of LZW or not (software being used may be &quot;old&quot; and by default *not* use LZW due to the patent concerns, and user has no idea that they should turn it on).<br /><br />That said: use of deflate or gzip on GIFs using LZW can/does help.  On Espozo's avatar, the actual transferred payload goes from 345KBytes to 306KBytes (39KB savings) using gzip (and I did turn on DEFLATE/gzip for .gif files in this context).  In other words: gzip's compression model seems to work semi-well on this file, despite it using LZW (I checked):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">$ curl --output /dev/null http://www.home.lan/wmxKWiQ.gif<br />&nbsp; % Total&nbsp; &nbsp; % Received % Xferd&nbsp; Average Speed&nbsp; &nbsp;Time&nbsp; &nbsp; Time&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Time&nbsp; Current<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dload&nbsp; Upload&nbsp; &nbsp;Total&nbsp; &nbsp;Spent&nbsp; &nbsp; Left&nbsp; Speed<br />100&nbsp; 345k&nbsp; 100&nbsp; 345k&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; 48.7M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 56.2M<br /><br />$ curl --compressed --output /dev/null http://www.home.lan/wmxKWiQ.gif<br />&nbsp; % Total&nbsp; &nbsp; % Received % Xferd&nbsp; Average Speed&nbsp; &nbsp;Time&nbsp; &nbsp; Time&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Time&nbsp; Current<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dload&nbsp; Upload&nbsp; &nbsp;Total&nbsp; &nbsp;Spent&nbsp; &nbsp; Left&nbsp; Speed<br />100&nbsp; 306k&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; 306k&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; 9826k&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 9884k<br /></div><br />Verification of LZW use in that GIF:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">D:\downloads\ImageMagick&gt;identify -verbose wmxKWiQ.gif | grep -c &quot;Compression: LZW&quot;<br />50<br /></div><br />Anyway, point is: animated GIFs (especially ones with lots of frames or visuals) are extremely annoying, waste bandwidth, and really bring absolutely nothing to the table.  When I was younger (back in the days when animated GIFs were the hot new thing), sure, I made several myself and they were prolific (esp. on Geocities).  Those of us from that era now find them quite annoying (cuz people do stupid things like make 2-3MByte animated GIFs from portions of an anime, for example), especially if hosted by infrastructures or platforms which don't support caching.  I myself do use an animated GIF avatar on occasion, but guess how big the file is?  3.9KBytes; I think it's like 4 frames of animation (edit: it's 6).  Not too distracting either.

When you asked about animated avatars I imagined you were going to make something original and relevant, not rip a video that wasn't made for small viewports and doesn't even loop. Not looping is a serious offense in an animated avatar, because it constantly draws attention when the animation wraps back to the beginning.

Occasionally I tether my laptop to my aunt's phone when we go on long trips, and when I tether, I stick to low-bandwidth sites such as forums.nesdev.com. (I also turn on Firefox's tracking protection for its side effect of blocking advertisers that track users' interests across sites, which has the side effect of blocking the most data-heavy ads.) So with two admitted occasional users of cellular Internet here and a distracting rewind, I may end up taking one representative frame from <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wmxKWiQ.gif" class="postlink">the GIF</a> to produce a PNG avatar.
