		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm working through Disch's mapper docs and the wiki trying to get a handle on the MMC3's scanline counter so I can better understand the first boss battle in Super C. In short, once you hit the end of the level, scrolling halts and a large helicopter flies into view from the left side. My hypothesis was that the heli was drawn with BG tiles (Mega Man-style) and scrolled while the static lower terrain was handled with a scanline IRQ. This seems to be the case.<br /><br />However, I wanted to look at <em>how</em> this happens programmatically and I'm tripped up on a small detail. (I'm new to both FCEUX debugging and MMC3, so bear with me.) I set breakpoints on the IRQ registers. $C000 (count value), $C001 (reset counter), and $E000 (IRQ disable) appear to be written every VBLANK (or twice?). $C000 never varies from #$F0. As expected, $E001 (IRQ enable) is not written until the 'boss area' scrolls into view. FCEUX throws a break at scanline 162. When I fool around with the scroll line display in the Name Table Viewer, I can verify that that is the point where the IRQ fires.<br /><br />My confusion stems from the value in $C000. How does #$F0 count down to triggering at scanline 162? My only suspicion about the discrepancy is that shortly after the write to $C000, there are ten writes to $2006 (all #$00 as far as I can tell). The MMC3 docs indicate that this can manually manipulate the scanline counter, but I don't understand either enough to know how. <br /><br />Surely I'm missing something. Or maybe I'm totally off base. Any insight is appreciated.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The mmc3 scan line counter is triggered off of CHR A12 rising edges (only if chrA12 was previously low for ~5 CPU cycles to prevent multiple clocks during sprite fetching)<br /><br />So accesses to $2006 will take CHR A12 high thus clocking the scan line counter the value is irrelevant.  That's the &quot;how&quot; youre asking about.  But I don't see how 240-10=160.  Which NT are the BG and sprites mapped to?  If they don't follow normal &quot;rules&quot; you can clock the scan line counter more than once per scanline which might be the reason for the math 'error'

Let me step through my process to verify.<br /><br />I opened FCEUX's 6502 Debugger, went to the BreakPoints field, and clicked the Add... button. I then input C000 in the address field, checked 'Write,' and left the 'CPU Mem' radio button selected. Each time the breakpoint hits, I get one of two outputs in the debugger:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">07:FC12:A2 FF&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDX #$FF<br />07:FC14:8E 00 C0&nbsp; STX $C000 = #$F0<br />07:FC17:8E 01 C0&nbsp; STX $C001 = #$03<br />07:FC1A:A9 10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA #$10<br />07:FC1C:8C 06 20&nbsp; STY $2006 = #$00<br />07:FC1F:8C 06 20&nbsp; STY $2006 = #$00<br />07:FC22:8D 06 20&nbsp; STA $2006 = #$00<br />07:FC25:8D 06 20&nbsp; STA $2006 = #$00<br />07:FC28:8C 06 20&nbsp; STY $2006 = #$00<br />07:FC2B:8C 06 20&nbsp; STY $2006 = #$00<br />07:FC2E:8D 06 20&nbsp; STA $2006 = #$00<br />07:FC31:8D 06 20&nbsp; STA $2006 = #$00<br />07:FC34:8C 06 20&nbsp; STY $2006 = #$00<br />07:FC37:8C 06 20&nbsp; STY $2006 = #$00</div><br /><br />or:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">07:FC40:A5 45&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA $0045 = #$A2<br />07:FC42:8D 00 C0&nbsp; STA $C000 = #$F0<br />07:FC45:8D 01 C0&nbsp; STA $C001 = #$03<br />07:FC48:9D 00 E0&nbsp; STA $E000,X @ $E001 = #$2C</div><br /><br />(I bumped the results back a line so you could see the LDA/LDX commands. The second block also doesn't have the string of $2006 writes.)<br /><br />Is this the wrong approach? What I don't get is why the values loaded in X and A don't match those showing up in the output. Again, this might be me misinterpreting the debugger output.

For a normal STA to RAM, not a mapper write, that would represent the value being overwritten. Look at the LDA #$A2 to see the count you expect.
