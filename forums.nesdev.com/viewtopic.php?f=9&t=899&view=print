I just bought a cart with the appropriate size, so I could put my game on it, and I can't find the right chips! Any suggestions on where to find these? It also doesn't have to be Atmel, but I'd prefer Atmel. Please respond, if you know where I could find some. Thanks!

I just take the prg or chr rom information and double it or quadruple it to fill the entire chip using a hexedit program. I also disable the extra address lines on the devcart so I can use any size EPROM.

And the chips together were like 10 or 11 dollars, I don't know. Really not that expensive though. Yeah, I attempted to put my game on an SMB1/Duck Hunt cart once more, and I realized it didn't work again. So I tried taking out my chips and putting the mask roms back in, to see if it was the chips. Well, I didn't exactly get that far. When I pulled out my PRG EPROM, there were still pins in board that got ripped off the chip, and there was a frickin' I/O line that ripped off stuck from one pin to the pin across and a couple over. When I saw that I/O line that got ripped off, I said, "Yep. I just broke it." And I threw the cart  in my may-be-useful-later-for-whatever-reason junkpile. That was dumb. Well, I realized that I was using weird memory sizes, and I probably programmed the chip wrong.

<br />You know, you don't <em>have</em> to ramble on and on like that every time you post - sometimes it's best to just keep it short and simple.

<br />Celius you do ramble quite a bit. It's not a big deal but kind of tiresome. Don't worry about it too much . I think Quietust (and others) were just tired of the "Well, so then I decided because of.. I should.. so I did..", "But it doesn't matter, 'cause then this happened..",  kind of phrasing. Kind of pointless filler. 
<br />
<br />Grammar is spelt with an 'A'.
<br />
<br />Edit: fixed typo (grammar).
