<br />-ripping backgrounds from DKC (albeit with the animation and parallax removed) instantly makes your SMW hack more technically impressive or CPU consuming.
<br />
<br />After all this time, shouldn't their own experience as a programmer shine through?

Honestly...people like that aren't worth your time. Seek out people who really do know what they are talking about, and make friends with them. Then you can forget about reading egotistical blather on that forum. Maybe stick around nesdev longer, there seems to be way less of that nonsense here. There's the occasional barb, but that's about it.

<br />
<br />Anything you see on their forums, you should take with a grain of salt. There are a few people who know what they're doing there, but they're drowned out by a bunch of crap. That crap is a combination of people saying stupid things, and them trying to respond to the stupid things (and not succeeding). Often, <em>everyone</em> ends up looking bad.
<br />
<br />Then again, this is typical of any large community, which I would have the same advice for.

<br />The best replacement would probably be "how come", since "but" doesn't really fit a sentence that starts with "if".
<br />
<br />Anyway, I don't know anything about this smwcentral place, but every community has dumb people. Some also have smart people, but no community has <em>only</em> smart people, so I'd say it's fairly common to see good things and dumb things coming from the same place.

<br />Another thing that drives me crazy is when people say "posting with the sole intent of..."  How do you know what the intent of posting was?  You can't read my mind.  You can't even hear my tone of voice or see my body language.  What makes you think you can read my mind?
