		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've got a parallax effect in one level of my new game. It works perfectly on emulators and on the original NES. But on AVS, after the second split the scroll kind of jitters up and down. I'm experimenting with ways to nudge the scroll update so that it aligns more correctly with hblank, but I can't seem to get it perfect on AVS. I either get scroll bounce, or a small glitch (similar to the status bar glitch in SMB3).

The other relevant thing I can say is that although changing the scroll takes a complex sequence of $2006/5/5/6 writes, only the last two wires have to happen during hblank for you to get a clean split, so that's just 5 cycles (the last cycle of the second $2005 write, plus e 4 cycles of the second $2006 write) you need to for in hblank, which leaves a lot of wiggle room for you to work with.

It shows me the ppu cycle if I set a breakpoint, so I set a breakpoint at the first of those last two writes to 2005 and 2006, and if it is between 256 and 341 I should be okay, right? it kept landing around 280 or so.<br /><br />So here's the thing, works perfect on Mesen, Nestopia, Nintendulator, original NES, but on AVS, the second split bounces by 1 scanline.<br /><br />It's a train, and looks kinda cool, so I might just have to live with it. But it made my OCD go off pretty bad. I don't know if I can make it work the same on all. Sure wish I could.<br /><br />Wondering if I fine tune it further to more reliably land closer to 256 in that range if there'd be less chance of the writes bleeding outside of hblank.<br /><br />It's weird that it bumps a whole scanline though it makes me think something odd is happening with respect to reloading the mmc3 scanline counter that's making it off by 1 sometimes and not others though. Yet it IS only AVS with this issue.

I know it should work either way, but I think it's important to point out that if you used flash carts, you haven't used a single real MMC3 this whole time, only emulations/simulations of it, and maybe it'd be a good idea to give the real thing a try.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some of Mega Cat titles had mmc3 issues on AVS, which only appeared on some firmware versions and not others (you can find the details at NA's AVS forum). They weren't what you saw, slight jitter, but an irq entirely missing on some frames. Still, it only happened on AVS, only on some firmware versions, on real (repro) mmc3 boards, so it's possible your issue too is something in the AVS firmware.<br /><br />I agree with tokumaru that you need to post what you're testing on.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm using the PowerPAK with thefox's powermappers. (can't remember if that replaces mmc3 or not. probably not?).<br /><br />I think next step I'm going to get a board and programmer from INL and try their mmc3 implementation, see if I get different results.<br /><br />I keep wondering though if there's anything subtle in my implementation that could make the AVS happy. While experimenting there was at least one moment where FCEUX was off by one scanline versus the other emulators. Not bouncing like AVS, but off by one scanline.<br /><br />My question is:<br /><br />Does it matter when the mmc3 scanline counter is reset? If the timing is off and occurring very near where the ppu is going to start the next line could this conceivably cause an off-by-one scanline issue?<br /><br />So in addition to trying the actual hardware my game will be released on instead of the PowerPAK, I think I'll try pushing out the scanline reset by a handful of cycles with some nops or something. I'm doing it RIGHT after the split x/y scroll writes.

I'm wondering if the timing of the mmc3 counter reset is important as well and might cause an off by one scanline problem?<br /><br />I'm wondering if I inserted enough nops between these operations if it might prevent jitter on touchier systems.

Normally, the first IRQ will be setup during vblank, when the MMC3 isn't clocked, and subsequent IRQs are setup inside the IRQ handler, so it should be easy to avoid this problem.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'm doing it RIGHT after the split x/y scroll writes.</div><br />IIRC, the scanline counter is clocked when the sprite patterns are fetched, so by the time hblank is over, it should be safe to schedule the next IRQ.

So it is conceivable to me that I'm resetting the scanline counter still during hblank, since I do this <em>right after</em> those writes. And I'm not sure precisely where in hblank that fetch occurs. So perhaps a few nops could push the scanline counter reset far enough out that, if I have timed the 2005/2006 writes correctly, I can guarantee it won't be resetting at the wrong time? That's my hope right now. Going to try it later in the week  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  As well as try different mmc3 hardware.

It was just too annoying to find that in one build the IRQ would work and in the next one it wouldn't work, so in v23 I replaced it with an implementation that is completely synchronized to M2. The timings of this implementation are a little bit off from a real MMC3 (similar to Tengen's RAMBO-1 MMC3 clone, nothing extreme), but AFAICT it has been robust.

And/or you can try loopy's MMC3 (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://3dscapture.com/NES/">http://3dscapture.com/NES/</a><!-- m -->) if you don't need save states.<br /><br />The MMC3 IRQ implementation in PowerMappers v20 was somewhat quirky, some people had problems with it on some systems. Even though it used the exact same logic as in loopy's MMC3 implementation, there are gated clocks in the design and that causes problems as the timings change depending on the amount of other logic in the mapper (the save state stuff uses up almost all the logic resources in the FPGA). It was just too annoying to find that in one build the IRQ would work and in the next one it wouldn't work, so in v23 I replaced it with an implementation that is completely synchronized to M2. The timings of this implementation are a little bit off from a real MMC3 (similar to Tengen's RAMBO-1 MMC3 clone, nothing extreme), but AFAICT it has been robust.</div><br /><br />Cool I'll give it a try. Since you're familiar with how this mapper works, is my theory above at all conceivable? Like, do I need to ensure a fair distance between the split x/y 2005/2006 writes and the reset of the mmc3 scanline counter? I have these operations right next to each other; I'm wondering if it would be &quot;safer&quot; and admit a variance in mmc3 implementations to spread the two operations apart with a few nops or something, or if that's all speculation and not reflective of what may actually be happening with this 1 scanline jitter?
