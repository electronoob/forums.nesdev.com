		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi.
<br />
<br />Last weekend I traveled to Helsinki, Finland with a three man team and competed in the demo party ALTparty. We actually managed to win, to our big suprise.
<br />
<br />I just wanted to pass this on because I decided to add nesdev.com in the greetings list as a sign of gratitude for all the excellent information on the platform that helped me understand some of the quirks of the PPU. I didn't want to name anyone in particular since I did extensive searching on a wide range of topics, but rather thank the nesdev community as a whole for all the invaluable information that are available here.
<br />
<br />They haven't uploaded the demo on pouet.net as of this writing, but I did record it on sunday and uploaded it to youtube, so you can watch it here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lThuA3aA8s" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lThuA3aA8s</a>
<br />
<br />You can read some details about the production in the youtube description. I know it doesn't contain a lot of effects (like raster effects or mid-frame palette swaps) but it was a short 2w (evenings and weekends) production and none of us had worked with NES before, so cut us some slack will you? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />... and here we accept the award:
<br /><img src="http://eiramdoolf.blogg.se/images/2011/alt_party_2-copy_171853840.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />
<br />So I just thought you wanted to know about the shoutout, and once again: <strong>Thank you!</strong>

<br />
<br />None, really. By quirks I mostly meant poorly documented features I needed to understand the basics. I've done development for GBA before (professionally) so I know a bit about how Nintendo likes to design their hardware, but I ran into some issues early on and nesdev had the answers. For example I didn't realize that I needed to reset the 2006 tile pos at the end of vblank (before next frame) when I were done writing to PPU. That is a "quirk" in my book.
<br />
<br />The scene in the demo that pushes the hardware the most is the part with the nyan-cat. It pushes about as many nametable bytes as it can manage to copy during vblank, plus it uses 63 of the 64 available sprites. Had to do the sprite setup during frame rendering to save time for nametable copying in the vblank.
<br />
<br />I used MMC3 as the mapper of choice, mostly because of the many banks available, but I was also considering doing some IRQ effects. Unfortunately I only got IRQ to work in emu and not on my POWERPAK kit, so I wasn't sure I did it right and didn't dare to rely on it. I suspect I have a faulty kit or a bad firmware, because I had some other issues with bank switching also on hardware. I'm thinking of revisiting the IRQ issue and play with it some at a later date. But I think I'm done with NES for a while (but not forever). <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br /><strong>WhatULive4:</strong> hehe, yeah. Youtube compression ate the pixels. The homepage doesn't contain anything interesting right now. We are thinking of maybe adding links to all our previous released material later (while we haven't competed in demo before, we have in music, ANSI-gfx and other stuff).

<br />Yes, it is in PAL, because we live in the PAL-region and didn't want to import a new device.

<br />
<br />In my Chu Chu Rocket game, I was pushing out 216 tiles per frame in NTSC mode, and had to turn the screen on 3 scanlines into the frame.  But PAL mode has a much longer vblank time and you can push out far more tiles.

<br />And yeah, it's always good idea to upscale videos before uploading to YouTube even if the source material is 240p or whatnot, because the audio quality depends on the video resolution as well.
<br />
<br />The latest beta version of the PowerPak mappers should fix the MMC3 IRQ problems.
<br />
<br />And finally, the "correct" way to reset scroll at the end of vblank is to write to $2005 twice and to $2000 once. This way the scroll can be set to any 9-bit position in the nametables. Writing 0 twice to $2006 will work in some cases only.

<br />Good point.
<br />
<br />Actually "High Hopes" were an inspiration for me to pick the NES platform and Pornotracker was used for the music in the demo, so we probably owe you an extra thank you.

<br />
<br />No PPU RAM, only PPU ROM (2x 4kb). Is that a MMC3 feature? We only used bank switching from MMC3, no other mapper specific features.
<br />
<br />Here are some of the prototypes and releases we made for GBA/NDS/PDA: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.velinje.com/pixelknights">http://www.velinje.com/pixelknights</a><!-- m -->

<br />He meant for name tables. With 2 extra KB of RAM you get a total of 4 name tables to work with (i.e. 4-screen mirroring). It's not specific to the MMC3, any mapper can have that.

<br />Another tip: Always make the PRG and CHR bank sizes a power of two, or you may have problems with certain emulators and PowerPak.

<br />
<br />Ah, ok. Didn't think about that.
<br />
<br />Would it have been possible to write to the offscreen nametable during frametime? That would have freed up a lot of vblank time in that case.
