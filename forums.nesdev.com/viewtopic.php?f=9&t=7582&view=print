We (my friend) has made a test-cart with sockets (MMC3, TS-ROM) <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=2435">http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=2435</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />We made some test eproms using 27C010 eproms, and they worked fine in the test cart. Then we tried using 27C020 eproms (doubling up the data in a hexeditor so the filesize was doubled aswell...). No succes. The stuff we tried burning to the eproms didn't work. Strange, I guess it should work, or?
<br />
<br />According to the Repropak manual, <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=24&amp;products_id=42">http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.ph ... ucts_id=42</a><!-- m --> - 
<br />You can use both 27c010 and 27c020 eproms for that board. 
<br />
<br />Anyway I would like to make a MMC3 testcart for myself aswell. Could someone help me find pinout and instructions how to solder it? I tried finding it but without succes... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />Another question I have is: I want to make a D-pad Hero II repro. I need a TS-ROM donor cart for that aswell, or?

<br />I wouldnt recommend using one of those boards, but just my opinion.  I would use a recycled original nintendo board.  Nintendo boards went through years of quality control and tests, these are just made by some dude out of his house.

<br />
<br />Yeah right, those are of same quality as Nintendo boards, why would they be of worse quality? They're the same. And they don't come from "a basement" I wouldn't think. Bunnyboy does great work.
<br />
<br />
<br />And the reropak AND mmc1 retropak won't work on it since it's a MMC3 ROM. Thats why it's not working I would guess. What test ROM are you using?

<br />Occasionally, when I play my Battle Kid cart or my PowerPak, I get squiggly lines on the TV caused by RF interference that goes away when I move the A/V cable around. Perhaps Nintendo's board designs have some clever way to control RF leakage that bunnyboy didn't think of.

<br />Yes I know I can't use the repropaks for MMC3 stuff. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />Strange that Bunnyboy hasn't released some boards for MMC3. I mean my SMB2J that I bought from had a Retrousb-made MMC3 board in it (?) Hopefully it will come in the future!
<br />
<br />qbradq: Thanks for the links! Quite useful. Is there any site with pics too?

<br />Either that or it was a custom mapper implementing a subset of FDS.

<br />
<br />Would have to be a mapper hack I would think.  FDS is a different programming language from NES and the FDS system does all the converts kinda like the Super Gameboy does with the SNES.

<br />It grew out of some incidents on gbadev and on Slashdot where it was discovered that I was giving bad advice on things with which I had never had first-hand experience. (<a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=13608" class="postlink">This topic on gbadev</a> sums up some of the issues from that time.) Because I have never experimented with FDS, I lack the confidence of first-hand experience. There are coprocessor chips on other platforms' carts that are indeed programmed in different languages, most notably Super FX, SVP, and Super Game Boy, but the only ones I'm aware of on the NES or Famicom are <a href="http://www.chrismcovell.com/wideboy.html" class="postlink">Wide Boy</a> and <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=30&amp;products_id=87" class="postlink">Retrovision</a>, each of which contains the CPU/PPU chip of an original Game Boy.
<br />
<br />In other words: Mostly to prevent pedants from finding some sort of microcontroller somewhere in the FDS and calling me a liar.

<br />On the website he clearly states SMB2J is not the mapper hacked version meaning it shouldn't be the version Loopy hacked to MMC3.
