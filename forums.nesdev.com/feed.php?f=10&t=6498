The only reason to use 8kB is if you're really cutting corners on cart features, since 8kB RAMs will cost more than 32kB ones.  It's easy to bankswitch (but there's not much help from emulators).  I had proposed mapper #125, I think it was moved to #124, for Squeedo.  I believe NESten and Nintendulator had both supported this mapper, but I don't know if it is also in the normal release versions.  The regs are $5000,$5001,$5002 to bank PRG-ROM, WRAM, CHR-RAM, sized 32kB, 8kB, 8kB, respectively.<br /><br />That extra RAM pages opens up lots of use for compression.  Not only that, but persistent data, after you unpack your level you can then edit during the gameplay.  8kB is also a pretty good size for unpacking Nerdtracker and Famitracker songs.<br /><br />At some point compression is not going to matter, but loading speed will.  Since I've been messing with memory chips for a while now they've done nothing but get cheaper.  A 2 MByte ROM cost maybe $20, so of course I was happy to buy new 64kB ones for $1.  Recently I had seen new 2Mbyte EPROMs selling for $2.  If you fill that up with compressed data, that's a massive amount of data to create!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Jun 15, 2010 3:10 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Nadia wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />1) What all can we compress in an NES game? CHR area or PGM area or Both?<br /></div><br />For obvious reasons CHR-ROM can't ever be compressed, but if you are using CHR-RAM it makes sense to compress your tiles using the scheme you see fit. However, if you plan on animating patterns during gameplay I suggest you leave those specific tiles uncompressed so you can transfer them to VRAM faster.<br /><br />I don't see much benefit in compressing code, but data should be compressed whenever possible. Note that compressing data doesn't always mean using one of the classic schemes (RLE, LZSS, LZW, etc) and decompressing big chunks of data to WRAM prior to using them... there are several compression techniques that don't work like that at all.<br /><br />For example, using metatiles is a form of level map compression, and it doesn't require any more RAM, because you can decompress it on the fly. Without metatiles, each screen would need 1KB of memory (960 tiles + attributes), but with 2x2 metatiles a screen will need only 240 bytes. Of course there is the overhead of the dictionary (metatiles), but the more screens you have the less significant this overhead will be.<br /><br />In fact, depending on the type of project you're working on, the overhead for metatiles can be close to nothing. I've seen people using 6 bits of the metatile index to indicate which 4-tile group from the pattern table it uses and 2 bits for the palette. This will work fine depending on the complexity of your graphics, and is extremely compact.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />2) When a cart(like the one used in MC Kid) provides additonal RAM storage, does it have CHR ROM?<br /></div><br />There is no rule preventing an MMC3 game from using extra RAM and CHR-RAM, but like tepples said not many commercial games used that combination. It is certainly possible though, even if making carts with that configuration might require some modding of the boards.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Jun 15, 2010 8:27 am</p><hr />

CHR area or PGM area or Both?<br /></div><br />It's always possible to find an efficient encoding for things in the PRG area, such as maps, music, etc. Some of these more efficient encodings don't even need a ton of extra RAM to decode, such as the object-based maps in Super Mario Bros. But you need CHR RAM to be able to decompress CHR data.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />2) When a cart(like the one used in MC Kid) provides additonal RAM storage, does it have CHR ROM?<br /></div><br /><a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?unif_op=LIKE+%60%25%40%25%60&amp;unif=SNROM&amp;cic_op=%21%3D%60%40%60&amp;cic=None&amp;group=groupid&amp;field=2&amp;order=asc" class="postlink">A bunch of SNROM games</a> have MMC1, CHR RAM, and additional PRG RAM.
