		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I took an old SMB1 cartridge and replaced the ROMs with a set of sockets in order to test fresh EPROMs before committing them permanently to another board. I have had luck doing this with a TSROM board (for playing around with Mario Bros 3 hacks) but I have run into some problems with my NROM board.
<br />
<br />Let me preface this by saying that, as I understand it, no rewiring is necessary for NROM boards. If I am wrong feel free to tell me how wrong I am.
<br />
<br />I decided to test this board by burning the original game (unmodified SMB) to a pair of EPROMs (M27C512) to see what happens. I split the ROM file using CopyNES and burned the respective PRG and CHR data to their own EPROMs, as I have done in the past, using a GQ-4X True USB Universal Programmer. Blank check and write check both passed. I seated the EPROMs in their sockets, loaded the game in, and only got a grey screen with the power cycling every second or so.
<br />
<br />I read somewhere on this forum that sometimes when you use EPROMs with a larger storage capacity than the originals, you need to fill the whole EPROM with the same data repeating. As I am using M27C512, double the size of the Super Mario Bros PRG alone, I tested this theory. Using a hex editor I made a pair of new files which contained the PRG and CHR data repeated to fill 512kbits. I burned these to EPROMs, loaded them into the board, and the result was just got a solid grey screen with no looped power cycling. A bit different, but still no dice.
<br />
<br />Does anyone with experience hacking NROM boards know what might be causing this? Am I using the wrong EPROMs, or is something else screwing this up?
<br />
<br />Thanks for your time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />NROM should be easier to do than TSROM in every way. Indeed, no rewiring is necessary for most types of ROMs. You were also correct in filling up the chips with the data repeated over and over. It should be working. I can only guess that the problem is with the soldering of some pin(s). Have you checked the connections with a multimeter to make sure all contacts are OK?
<br />
<br />Since NROM doesn't need rewiring, you could even test the board with the original ROMs, if they're still usable. If they work, you'll know the problem is the EPROMs or how you programmed them, otherwise it's the board.

<br />
<br />JEDEC (pinout matches eproms and there's no rewiring requirements)
<br />
<br />NON JEDEC (Pinout is defined by the MASK ROM manufacturer and Nintendo took that consideration on board design)
<br />
<br />
<br />For instance, TSROM boards only have JEDEC compliant pinout in it's DEVELOPER version as it's intended to use EPROMs by design.

<br />
<br />Usually MASK ROMS from Nintendo have the game code in them like for example:
<br />
<br />HVC-UM  would be the code for the Japanese copy of Super Mario BROS3.
<br />
<br />There would be two chips on the cart:
<br />
<br />HVC-UM PRG
<br />HVC-UM CHR 
<br />
<br />There would also be manufacturer code on the chips as well.

<br />"copy /b *.chr chr.BIN
<br />copy /b *.prg prg.BIN"
<br />Save file and change extension from *.txt to *.bat.
<br />Now copy and paste chr file till they equal 64 KB and repeat for prg file.
<br />Now run bat file and you should have the right size bin files for 512.
<br />If you've already done all that then if you are using a front load nes you may need to put something on top of cart to hold in correct place since the positioning bar I'm guessing is removed. I've notice some carts work every time but some need this done.
