I may need to add a test of writing to $D000-$DFFF to make sure that writes to $D000-$DFFF go only to the register value and not to register select. Because PRG /CE changes several nanoseconds later than M2, the decoding function might confuse $5000-$5FFF with $D000-$DFFF.

Because PRG /CE changes several nanoseconds later than M2, the decoding function might confuse $5000-$5FFF with $D000-$DFFF.</div><br /><br />Probably a good idea to check out.  Although if the Game never writes to $D000-DFFF it shouldn't be a problem, but you can't really guarantee that from your end.  I wouldn't expect it to be an issue because decoding WRAM has the same issue with $6000-7FFF vs $C000-FFFF.  When writing to $C000-FFFF A13,14,/CE,&amp;M2 are all high for the couple nanoseconds you're talking about.  This could cause obvious issues especially with mappers such as MMC3.  I think the think that's preventing the issue is the minimum pulse width of the WRAM.  A quick look shows it's somewhere around 15nsec, which is quite a bit longer than the M2/CE decoding glitch.  <br /><br />I actually did see this decoding glitch propagating to the /CE pin on the WRAM at one point when I was debugging early on with this multi-discrete mapper.  Probably worth going back and trying to measure the width just for reference, although my 30+yr old scope might be a little slow to accurately measure such small pulses...<br /><br />I can't really figure out what the minimum pulse width is on the XC9500XL series CPLDs from datasheets...  Running the low slew rate setting should help out for these things.  I'd guess we're okay but can't be 100% sure without actually testing it.

Because PRG /CE changes several nanoseconds later than M2, the decoding function might confuse $5000-$5FFF with $D000-$DFFF.</div><br /><br />So I've confirmed that the whole /M2 to PRG /CE delay can cause issues in practice.  I noticed I was having issues with loopy's mmc3 version of  SMB2j with my usual decoding of A13,14,PRG/CE,M2 for $6000-$7FFF.  Digging a little into the ROM I realized during start up it copies a bank of PRG ROM into WRAM and then operates from WRAM for the most part (including the potentially trouble some writes to the scanline counter)  I don't know where it was getting tripped up exactly, either the coping massive block to WRAM or operating from WRAM.  But either way I was getting 20nsec glitches on WRAM /CE due to the PRG/CE delay from M2.<br /><br />I was able to resolve everything by placing a 1nF cap on WRAM /CE line to filter out the glitch.  Kind of a hassle to resolve this problem though, because the best solution would be to delay M2 far enough to remove the glitch, I'm guessing that's what Nintendo does in it's ASIC mappers. In an asic you can just add a series of slow inverters to give a good amount of delay, but in a (simple) CPLD like the Xlinix 9500XL series you don't have tools like this available to you.<br /><br />Just speculation: but this may also be part of the reason that you're able to disable writes to WRAM on the MMC3.  I don't know what most games' practice is for when they disable writes to WRAM and how many games actually operate/execute from WRAM.<br /><br />The only good way to delay M2 that I could come up with is to add some external gates which is kinda a pain/expensive...  I tried a few RC filters on M2 but the few combos I tried were affecting M2 on the mobo which in turn delayed PRG/CE further and never really got rid of the glitch...  Or the resistor was too big and the cap would charge up but never discharge.  Thinking about it now, perhaps adding a capacitor discharge resistor to ground would work out.  Kinda like having a voltage divider with a filter cap in parallel with the 'bottom' resistor.  One other thing I didn't consider was trying to make use of the CPLD's input capacitance by just putting a large resistor on the input.<br /><br />In any event I thought I'd share my related findings thus far, perhaps writing that test wouldn't be a bad idea.  And see if you can break it for register writes...  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I'd suggest talking to the developer and pointing out this info to them asking for support.  The availability of source code should make it fairly painless for them.
