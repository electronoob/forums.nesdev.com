<br />
<br />The software was more trouble than anything else. As expected, I couldn't get the par port to work with Win XP, even with IO access programs. So I had to fallback to Win 98. Initially, the BIOS setting for the port was "Bi-directional", this sort of worked, you could tell the PC and NES were communicating to some extent, but dumping did not work. Next I tried ECP mode, this worked marginally better than Bi-Dir. Next I tried EPP, and that turned out to be the magic setting. Works great!
<br />
<br />So I would suggest to others that they try EPP mode initially.
<br />
<br />Your the man, Kevin!
<br />
<br />Now if you'll excuse me, I have about 300 carts to dump <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Do you have the expensive desoldering station?  I was thinking of using the $12 dollar desoldering iron from RadioShack but if you are having trouble with the desoldering station then I am in for a big treat.

<br />
<br />Yes, the radio shack desoldering iron SHOULD work... Just practice a little first on some old junk boards before trying it on your NES!   I had one of those irons and they do work.  The trick is to go over the pins you are going to desolder with a soldering iron first and add some more solder to them, kinda like if you were soldering them for the first time.  This will put flux on there and a little more solder which will make life alot easier.  
<br />
<br />I even will add a little bit of fresh solder before using the tool I have.  It works alot better.

I use the same trick Kevin does, with adding more solder, except I only do that if the delsoldering iron doesn't want to pull everything out. Which is what I was refering to in this case. Generally it does clean the entire hole, but in this case it only worked on like half of them so then you have to go and resolder all the holes it didn't and try again. Just time consuming, the end product is worth it though <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Quietust wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I've been working on a Windows client for CopyNES for a while now, but I haven't been able to effectively test it since I haven't had a CopyNES.

<br />
<br />I was considering making a Windows port as well. But it sounds like you've taken care of it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> That's fine with me, I have plenty of other things to keep my busy for a while.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />WooHoo, I assembled my copynes and it works great.  The first cart I dumped was Super C.  The hardest part was desoldering the CPU. I used the RadioShack desoldering iron and it worked great, there where some pins that just would come undone.  I kept adding solder and sucking it out and I eventually got it out.  Be very careful when you taked the cpu out.  I inadverdently busted a trace to the cpu.  I ended up soldering wire between the connections where the trace broke.  Be Patient.
<br />
<br />I am also using a really old 486 Laptop running Win95.  BTW, CopyNES works great on Win95.  No pesky Parallel port problems.
<br />
<br />Anyway, when dumping unknown carts, how do you go about finding out what the mapper is?  In order for me to test, I ran the cart's rom in FCEU then I get the mapper info.  This allows me to select the right mapper in CopyNES Dump function.
<br />
<br />Oh well, Thanks Kevin for sending the COPYNES quickly.

<br />
<br />Maybe somebody could write a plugin that auto-detects a cart's mapper for all known mappers.  The problem with such a thing is that for a cart with an unknown mapper, the auto-detected mapper wouldn't be correct.  But at least it would make things easier for dumping 99% of all carts.

For example, the TLROM board, by far the most common among the MMC3 boards, has a maximum size of 512KB PRG and 256KB CHR.  No TLROM game that I know maxes out the board.  If the game has 256KB of PRG, for example, will CopyNES return a ROM larger than 256KB?  If so, what will the extra 256KB show?  A mirror of the lower 256KB, all 0s or 1s, or random reads?

<br />
<br />Well really you <em>should</em> open the cart up and find the board name. I'm working on a database where you can find this info out. Should be online very soon. With CopyNES out now, I'd really like to get it opened up so people can submit to it as they dump their carts. I have only dumped ~10 carts so far, and already have come across 2 dumps not in circulation. A Mega Man 4 PRG revision 1 and alternate Wizards &amp; Warriors.
