		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, I've read the wiki page and the linked data sheets on the EEPROM. I don't know much about electronics and I have trouble understanding what they say. Sorry for the long post, I have a few questions at the end. And here is what I understand for 24C02, please correct me if anything is wrong or missing:<br /><br />1. To do anything, the game needs to get EEPROM out of STANDBY MODE. EEPROM recognizes this if SDA moves from low to high while SCL is high. The game does this by writing a sequence of bytes $40 $60 $20 to $800D where bit 6 is SCL and bit 5 is SDA.<br /><br />2. EEPROM waits for the game to issue a single byte command. The low bit of the command determines whether it is a read command(low bit = 0) or a write command(low bit = 1).<br /><br />3. EEPROM waits for the game to send a single byte address.<br /><br />4. EEPROM waits for the game to send a single byte data for a write command or EEPROM sends a single byte of data for a read command.<br /><br />5. To input each bit, the SCL goes from low to high and back, EEPROM take the state of SDA during that period as a bit value and write it to a temp location with high bit first. The game does this by writing $00 $20 $00 for 0 and $00 $40 $60 $40 $00 for 1.<br /><br />From here on I'm a bit confused:<br /><br />6. To read each bit, set the SDA high and then set bit 7 to high to get the value ready in bit 4. If SCL is set to low then the bit is read as an acknowledgement at the end of reading or writing a byte. Otherwise it is a read from the address sent by the game.  <br /><br />7. After the acknowledgement, the address will increment by 1 and the game can continue to read or write the next byte. To stop writing, send a stop signal after the acknowledgement. To stop reading, send a stop signal in place of the acknowledgement. <br /><br />8. The EEPROM recognizes the stop signal if SDA moves from high to low while SCL is high. The game does this by writing a sequence of bytes $20 $60 $40 $C0.<br /><br />Is the acknowledgement for a read command same as one for a write command?<br />Is the $C0 in the stop signal required? <br />Disch's doc says a read will not advance the bit and a write is required. Is that true?<br />Can someone show some example code where the whole byte is read?<br />What happens if the game does not follow the sequence? Do I need to care when writing an emulator?<br /><br />Thanks.
