		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I've fixed lots of bugs in my CPU and I now have the following test ROMs passing 100%:
<br />
<br />- Flubba's NEStress
<br />- Kevtris' nestest
<br />- Blargg's nes_cpu_test5 (official only)
<br />- Blargg's nes_intr_test (official only)
<br />
<br />So what would be the next best CPU test ROM to try and get working?  I couldn't find any particular "ordering" (on the Wiki or otherwise) of which tests to get working first. I have the following CPU tests available (all Blargg's) that I think would be the best to pick from:
<br />
<br />cli_latency
<br />cpu_interrupts_v2
<br />nes_intr_misc
<br />nes_instr_timing (instr_timing - unofficial)
<br />
<br />Can someone recommend an order to the above tests?  Or just the next best one?  Or if there is a different test that I should run that is not shown above please let me know. I'm not limiting myself to the above tests.  In fact, the more tests I have the better!
<br />
<br />Thanks!
<br />
<br />Jonathon
<br />
<br />UPDATE: I now have the following additional tests passing:
<br />
<br />- Blargg's cpu_timing_test6
<br />- Blargg's branch_timing_tests
<br />- Blargg's nes_intr_timing (instr_timing - official only)
<br />- Blargg's nes_intr_timing (branch_timing)
<br />
<br />I think the other CPU test ROMs that I'm failing are due to my incomplete APU module.  I think I'm going to forget about more CPU testing and work on finishing my APU next (after a bit of code cleanup).

<br />I'd say the branch timing tests and CPU timing tests are good to do next.  Bad CPU timing makes Battletoads shaky.

<br />
<br />I am using Kevtris' Nestest and am wondering how to interpret the errors.  I assumed they were opcodes, but some of them do not correlate properly with the type of test that's being run and some are just erroneous.  I have attached an image of the test running.  (I still have some graphical kinks to work out).  I'll also type it out to make things easier.
<br />
<br />Er  Run all tests
<br />OK Branch tests
<br />13  Flag tests
<br />75  Immediate tests
<br />45  Implied tests
<br />48  Stack tests
<br />4D  Accumulation tests
<br />70  (Indirect, X) tests
<br />AE  Zerospace tests
<br />E8  Absolute tests
<br />05  (Indirect), Y tests
<br />4F  Absolute, Y tests
<br />34  Zerospace, X tests

<br />
<br />I can only assume that bad data is being passed into the error spot because of other problems with my code.  Can someone clarify how to interpret the errors?  Is the data in the 'Er' spot supposed to represend the OpCodes that are not executing properly?
<br />
<br />Thanks

<br />
<br />Whoops, I was doing something silly and thought that starting at C000 was wrong because the nestest rom would only run if I started at the address pointed to by the IVT.  And my log looked MUCH different than the gold version, so I wasn't sure what was going on.  Now I realise that I just have another problem to squish.
<br />
<br />That being said, I'm still curious to know if there is any relevent information in the error code that is displayed on the screen.?

<br />
<br />- I suppose it's because the stack is at $00, then the CPU decrements 3 on reset. $00 - 3 = $FD.

<br />That is exactly correct, and it's how I have implemented my CPU in hardware.  In integrated circuits it is typical (and good practice) to clear all flops to '0' on power-up (except in very peculiar cases where you might absolutely have to have a bit set for proper operation).
<br />
<br />Pz!

<br />However, I'm not sure how to go about accounting for invalid opcodes.  Right now I just have a "default" line in my switch statement that just lets me know an invalid opcode has been called and then it just adds 1 to the program counter.
<br />
<br />If you guys could point me in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it.

<br />If it is not important for making a good emulator, then I am not that concerned about it.  I just don't want to run into problems in the future.  But I did read somewhere that no games (or almost no games) make use of them.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Most games do not make use of illegal opcodes, but the NES CPU behaves exactly like a common 6502 in this regard, meaning that all instructions are there and behave as described, so a few programs do use them.
<br />
<br />I remember that a real-time polygon rotation demo used some illegal instructions, but I can't think of any commercial games right now. Still, for NES developers this might be an interesting feature for an emulator to have, as that makes it more like the real console.
