<br />
<br />pros
<br />Don't feel like you need to fine-tune the colors as much as SNES.
<br />cons
<br />Sometimes, the color your looking for is just not there.
<br />
<br />SNES:
<br />
<br />pros
<br />Usually you'll find the color you need.
<br />cons
<br />Sometimes colors are so close to eachother, it gets hard to find the perfect shade, among similar looking colors.

<br />Genesis, SNES - not that fun, because they provide a lot of freedom compared to these.

<br />
<br />This may sound like a joke, but if you think about it it really makes sense. If you reduce your options on purpose, it gets easier to pick the initial palettes, and then you fine tune the ones that feel off.

<br />I like to work with fixed palettes, you have your limits set and you got to work within them, you can just do anything right away without being able to worry too much as there's too little to cause any significant headache.

<br />If you are doing SNES-dev I'd consider using a HSL to RPG conversion program so you can pick the hue and brightness of all your colors and it's easier to get the color you want like that than by using R, G and B values.

<br />
<br />I think the ideal color space for games would be HSY, (hue, saturation, luminance) but I don't know where I can get one.
<br />
<br />With RGB palettes, I think 4096 colors is the perfect balance between too little and too much.  I always thought the SNES's 32000 colors was overkill for the type of graphics that you usually saw on the SNES.  The CPS2 only had 4096 colors and nobody ever complained about it.

So GIMP has a couple color pickers that display the color in HSL and then convert it to RGB after the user clicks OK.

That would put pure green at a higher lightness than pure blue, as you'd prefer.

<br />SNES supports transparency in hardware.
<br />About lightning, HSL is better than RGB as you can do various kinds of effects by addning some bias to the L values, and it'll look overall better than adding some bias to individual R, G and B components.
<br />
<br />Also you can do saturation effects (for example if something colored is turned to stone you can do it "smoothly" or hue effects (if you want something to change it's color gradually, it'll be extremely simple as opposed to the complex calculation it'd be in RGB).

<br />These are each a matrix multiplication in RGB. Slowly interpolating saturation in HSV family representations works if something turns to gray stone, not to colored stone, and definitely not to something with a different specularity such as metal.
