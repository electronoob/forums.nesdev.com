It's until fairly recently that he directed the domain name to his twitter page.

And I'm not sure if I can handle all that in the near future.<br />Probably I will order a (cheap) microcontroller . After having ruined some cartridges or the controller, I think I have to pay someone to build that for me or give it up.<br />I don't want to study for a very long time and waste money and destroy rare cartridges. Maybe I'm not smart enough or didn't spent enough time.<br /><br />I don't understand Chinese either. Although projects and images would have been found. I even searched the web by typing Chinese stuff. &quot;Gameking&quot; and most games have English titles even in China or elsewhere.<br />One of the problems is still to find a cartridge slot.<br /><br />Brian obviously stopped (or paused or abandoned) his project and deleted everything from the web including that particular SourceForge project (robots.txt). He claims to put there an emulator. Nothing to find at all anymore except via archive.org. Also others say that he stopped that.<br />Yes he is or was obviously busy with something else. What doesn't mean he consider(ed) making money of his knowledge in the future. Maybe there were legal issues or other reasons or he tries to find some cooperation with companies. Gameking 3 and 4 are even more mysterious and rare. I don't know the truth but I still doubt that he will help me. Interesting there are even at least 2 clones of the Gameking.  So clones of the clone.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I researched a bit more and almost ordered the dumping stuff.<br /><br />For the socket: Gameking, GB and GBA sockets seem to have the same contact distance. The Gameking cartridge is similar to the GB cart and the 30 pins seem to be at the same places as the 32 pins of the GB missing the outermost 2 pins. I need pins on both sides, so either use 2 GB slots or at least one slot on the rear and attach wires on front manually or build something custom.<br /><br />I only have 4-in1 carts. I opened one and it says Rev 1.0 2007E, year 2005. Different pinouts.<br />Brian claims to have Rev 1.0 but pics and descriptions match Rev 2.0. <br />I traced the lines and the 4-1 carts obviously have 20 instead of 17 ADR lines. Pins 20,21 and 50 connected to the glob.<br />Pin 10 is also connected to VCC. Brian said S1 with unknown function.<br />Pin 15 is NC (Brian said S2).<br />Pin 46 is connected somewhere to the front PCB  (Brian said S3). I can't see exactly where, as text is printed on. <br />ADR pins are much better arranged making a 45 degree line.<br />Some other pins seem to be arranged or shifted differently. Pin 29 is attached to the glob on the front side instead of the rear. I can upload PCB pics.<br /><br />What does that mean, especially for dumping? Bank switching? Pins must be compatible to all Gamekings. Maybe the 4-1 carts have color infos for Gameking 3?<br /><br />What about emulating? A 65C02 is used. Much of the data are uncompressed graphics (which can be extracted using Brian's editor). The sound probably consists of samples. The rest must be the game code. <br />Is that simple 6502 code or maybe encrypted opcodes or a custom 6502?  Could Brian and LiraLuna managed it that easy with encryption? Graphics are more likely GB based, games NES based. Sound, music and digitized speech of unknown origin. The GB has predefined sound effects, maybe they have been used. But could be any samples. Is NES capable of digitized speech?<br /><br />An Arduino ProMini 3.3 V is maybe the cheapest solution. 3 more ADR lines is no problem as I need 3 shifting devices anyway. I have rough schematics and tried to wire that up using fritzing.<br />Can I use pins 2-9 as data lines (analog or digital ?) and what latch pin to choose? Previously I have chosen Pin 6. Latch pin could be chosen but pins on a tiny board are limited and some reserved.<br />Any advice?

There seem to be different Arduinos standards. (especially PIN 13). And 3V hardware. <br />Cart size should be 128k. But how do I know if 4-in1 carts are bigger? And how big? The code would later give the answer. How long would a dump takes at 8MHZ?  5 minutes?<br /><br />Maybe a simulation like the LCD games would be easier. But needs completely playing a game and recording sound samples. Then drawing each pixel of the graphics by hand (background and character) what is no big deal at this resolution. However it's not the same as emulating.

In practice you will probably be uploading stuff at 11kiB/sec or slower (by using 115200 baud asynchronous serial).

And it must be possible with 5V like Brian did. You have to convert the voltage either way to get it to the PC. There are few 3V microcontrollers and they have limitations (hard+software). Anyway here are the pics. I don't think that more pins are used on other carts although there were other manufacturers. There are single games and 4-in1 games. Nothing else. Gameking 3 is probably different, but is backwards compatible playing old games in color like GBC. And I don't think that's a special 6502 as Brian created an emulator and a devcart without problems.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Although most Arduinos has 5V and 3.3V pins (internal or external voltage ?) the official specs don't recommend 3V. There are very few plain 3 V controllers. The Due (incompatible with other 5V Arduino hardware like shields, other problems and of course more expensive) and some tiny boards, most with fewer pins. So someone recommends a ProMini 3.3 V. A 5V Uno would require a secondary 3V AtMega 1284 controller.<br />The ProMini needs pin soldering and external USB board and shifting devices. But is probably the cheapest solution. The ProMin has internal (software ?) pull-up resistors but I understand that I better need resistors at the address lines.<br />Should I use 10k resistors with that 3V board? And a 100nF capacitor at the shifting device ST_CP? The dumping speed was meant with this hardware and Arduino USB connection.<br /><br />We can only speculate what PC Brian used in 2004. But he told about 5V pulling-up and pulling-down stuff.<br /><br />PCB pics: So I hope that pin 29 is still A1 although other aligned. Pin 46 is connected (s3) but I don't need it. Where is the 2nd control line? I only know for sure pin 18 CE.<br />If I don't need games 2-4 is it possible to use fewer address lines? Is bank switching likely here ? Or other dumping problems?<br /><br />I probably don't have enough programming skills, so that's why I want to use an existing similar project and simply change the values. And why not using the Arduino IDE? <br /><br />I first have ordered a GBA slot to check if I can use it.

You could probably read a 128KiB ROM in about 12 seconds.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">We can only speculate what PC Brian used in 2004. But he told about 5V pulling-up and pulling-down stuff.<br /></div>Using 3.3V for parallel ports has been standard since at least 1998, so while it's true that we don't know exactly what computer he was using, I doubt it was old enough to be actually running at 5V. He said he was using the Gameking as power rather than using an external adapter, so he was using its 3V supply for everything anyway, including buffering the output of the parallel port. So he dumped it all at 3V, even if he thought otherwise.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">PCB pics: So I hope that pin 29 is still A1 although other aligned. Pin 46 is connected (s3) but I don't need it. Where is the 2nd control line? I only know for sure pin 18 CE.<br />If I don't need games 2-4 is it possible to use fewer address lines? Is bank switching likely here ? Or other dumping problems?<br /></div>It looks like whatever bankswitching happens here is going to be part of the CPU, not part of the cartridge.<br />If you look at your photos, there's a bank of 10 on each side (address lines), skip 3, 1 line by itself on each side (control lines), skip one, and a final bank of 4 on each side (data lines).<br />The control lines are probably &quot;output data on data lines when both control lines are low&quot;<br />If you need more lines than you have control lines for, you could  fix some lines high or low manually and toggle them by hand, to dump N KB slices at a time and then reassemble them later.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I probably don't have enough programming skills, so that's why I want to use an existing similar project and simply change the values. And why not using the Arduino IDE?<br /></div>The software is really simple, and I think you could even do this without a reference to adapt from. As long as the arduino IDE works, there's no reason to not use it.
