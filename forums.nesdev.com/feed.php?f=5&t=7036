Got it, finished it. A+ all the way, though a little slow to start.<br /><br />Storywise, they did a fine job. The castle was suitably awesome. Gameplay felt a lot like Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, but with a lot better combat. It is amazingly pretty.<br /><br />Some people are just cranky by nature I suppose =P<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8">ReaperSMS</a> — Wed Oct 27, 2010 9:22 pm</p><hr />

I decided to give the game a chance. It doesn't feel like castlevania yet except for the fact that you have a whip. The game by itself is good once you forget that they put the Castlevania name on it. <br /><br />I think it was more of a marketing move to name it that way than anything else. If they would have tried to sell it as "Lords of shadow" only, as a new IP, it would have not fly much.<br /><br />What I read is that they made some kind of internal "compo" for 6 month and the one with the better project was going to get the game thumbs up. There was a studio in the US, one in Europe (Mercury steam) and the one in Japan led by IGA (the guy that cannot stop making Metroidvania one after another..).  After seeing the 3 projects, Konami was impressed by the project from Europe and Kojima got interest in it. The Europe studio already had a working game so I guess they were more serious than the other team.  The one from japan... They only did a promo video in 6 month! <br /><br />I want to find more information about it. I'm sure that more article and tidbits will come out.<br /><br />As for good game these days, Vanquish is nice, worth a try.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Wed Oct 27, 2010 5:44 pm</p><hr />

Being a fan of Castlevania... I'm not too keen on this one, especially after watching Konami's conference at E3. And seeing that not only did they decide to outsource it, but it is a re-imagining of sorts for the series. Not to mention the fact, that it doesn't look as fresh or radical as one guy claimed it was at the conference.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4546">MrNickelAss</a> — Thu Oct 14, 2010 10:18 pm</p><hr />

For now it doesn't feel like a Castlevania but I may give it a chance.  But I'm more inclined to want to try Vanquish instead, which is an original game and quite frantic for the action.  Can't wait that it comes out next week.<br /><br />@Pepper:<br /><br />There is a bug in the game that kill your save game. It seems to happen on the last boss but I don't know if other people had the bug elsewhere. Konami is making a patch at the moment.  I may wait before buying the game that they release the patch even thought I really want to try it. The other reason I wait is because the game is sold at 7000 yen (~86$ US) as in import so a little bit pricey.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Wed Oct 13, 2010 11:19 pm</p><hr />

^ I watch some videos on it.....It seems like there's spring EVERYWHERE, Which IMO slows it down but it doesn't seem bad at all. Except for the animation thing in mid air, that seems like it was very cheaply programmed on somebodies lunch break.<br /><br /><br />But still.....If all game companies did this, it'd be awesome. So many games would be revived, I like the idea. I need to get the demo.<br /><br /><br /><br />I bet it's not as bad as Medal Of Honor though. Just saying. MOH sucks.

I haven't played it or even heard about it actually, but man, that's disappointing (but I guess not too surprising) that Konami would outsource Castlevania.  I always thought that was a big part of it's charm, being an obviously Japanese game in style, but with a setting that was distinctly non-Japanese.  And the end credits in the first game never stop being hilarious.. music by James Banana?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Oct 12, 2010 4:19 pm</p><hr />

I haven't played it as I don't have any of the system it's developped for (X360, PS3).<br />However, I'm very positive about modern Castlevania games. I loved all PS2 and DS CV games as much as I loved the CV3 and SCV4 - in fact I feel CV is one of the rare series that is just as good as it was in its early days.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Oct 12, 2010 3:35 am</p><hr />
