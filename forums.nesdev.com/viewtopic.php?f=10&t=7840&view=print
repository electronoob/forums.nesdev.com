Having to move the CF card back and forth between the PowerPak and the PC is not practical at all. Also, the boot ROM alters the state of the console, so it's not exatly the same as if the NES booted straight to your program (i.e. you may forget to initialize something in your program but you won't realize that because the PowerPak boot menu that ran before DID initialize it). another issue is that even though the program itself is running on hardware, the mappers are still "emulated", and a lot of them don't behave 100% like the real ones.<br /><br />As I see it, the PowerPak is more of a device to play pirate ROMs than a development tool, but it's still of some use for development. Moving the CF card around is still faster than reprogramming ROM chips, and for the simpler mappers it doesn't really matter that they are emulated.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Are they still being made?</div><br />I think so.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Are there any alternatives?</div>
<br />Some members of this forum appear to be designing a couple of new carts, but I don't think any of them are as complete as the PowerPak. The obvious alternative is for you to build your own devcarts by installing sockets on different Nintendo-made carts and buying an EPROM programmer and flashROMs. This is the most authentic way to test your software on a real NES, but is not very practical.

<br />Like the NESDEV1? That project seems like instead of creating hardware to support all mappers, like the PowerPak, it's more like a superset of the most advanced cartridge/mapper so that people can use for their game development. Is that right?

<br />I use it as a tool to ensure 1. correctness of raster effect code, 2. look of graphics on a TV, and 3. control feel on a gamepad.

<br />It's totally worth it, I never said it wasn't. I use it for testing my own software all the time, much more than playing pirated games. I was just pointing out that it isn't the perfect development tool, because of all the CF card swapping, the fact that you don't get the untouched boot state and the few issues with mapper emulation (mostly related to IRQs).

<br />To get rid of card swapping you can build a USB&lt;-&gt;controller port cable and use a piece of software I wrote (see <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7520" class="postlink">this thread</a>).
<br />
<br />Also I don't think the IRQ/mapper problems are too bad anymore. But it's true there are differences between the real mappers and the PowerPak versions, sometimes because the behavior is different between different revisions of the original mapper (like MMC1), and sometimes to get better compatibility with existing games. For example the MMC3 WRAM protection is permanently disabled for compatibility with StarTropics.

<br />
<br />Yeah I'm the guy working on building the NESDEV1 over the next year.
<br />
<br />There are still a lot of details to be ironed out over the summer, but the whole goal is for game development on actual hardware.
<br />
<br />We'd like to provide a "superset" or more common mappers for developers, and also allow someone to make their own mapper by doing something like improving the MMC3 if they chose. 
<br />
<br />It would have a USB and possibly an SD card interface as a source for loading programming the "ROMS"
<br />
<br />Hopefully it will allow game developers to also easily transfer the hardware design to what they would need for production of the game without using donor carts.  The production cart would end up being a bare bones version of the NESDEV1.
<br />
<br />If you have any input on what you'd like to see, I'd love to hear it here:      <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7656&amp;start=195" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7656&amp;start=195</a>
