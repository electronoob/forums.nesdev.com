<br />What I need to know is if it's possible to use some form of programmable chip in place of a mapper chip. I'm interested in building a reprogrammable, multipurpose NES cartridge as the final project for my electronics course, however I only have a single Super Mario Bros/Duck Hunt combo cartridge, and I'm not interested in limiting my options to just GNROM and NROM games or destroying a perfectly good game. I cannot buy any additional NES cartridges, however I do have access to circuit board creation equipment (which I know how to use), and a large number of electronic components. I'm going to have to build this thing from scratch or not at all.
<br />
<br />So, is this possible? And if so, what materials will I need?

I mean, I can probably cobble together an EPROM eraser and writer. Additionally, I can't afford to buy parts. I have to use what's already in the electronics lab, and while there is a wide variety of parts there, I don't think we have a CIClone chip. So I'm just going to rely on grounding the fourth pin on the lockout chip. I'll keep looking for a 29F010.

<br />As long as the chip isn't actually an ASIC, but just a programmed PIC12F...., you could have that PIC12F.... instead and put the CIClone code on it.
<br />Else, just put a slot for a Nintendo CIC, and you may try to disolder it if you're able to (but I've never been able to remove any solder from those pins on any double-sided board personally).
<br />
<br />Else make your own shematic and PCBs. I was on the point to have my own board made, but I gived up because of my unability to disolder the MMC1 from an existing one without damagin the chip, among other things I'd be in trouble to get working. I could pass you some dimentions if you need to.
<br />
<br />Also, another problem is to have 1.2 mm thick boards made. 1.6mm standard would do, but force the pins on the connector, and then made it damaged to play other games (exept trough a game genie, wich I've heard is alwo 1.6mm, so if anyone have a game genie, they know what to exept with a 1.6mm thick board)

<br />Edit: Found something. I'm not sure how useful this will be, however, it has a parts list and a schematic. Including the part number for the CPLD.

<br />Unless your EPROM programmer supports GALs they won't be of any use to you. If you are going to be designing with GAL + 74 series, and don't have any GAL experience, you may as well only use 74 series chips since they don't need to be programmed. CPLD on the other hand are in system programmable by using a parallel port cable which you can build yourself from very cheap parts. 
<br />
<br />GALs are VERY cheap (like $2!) The most common are 16V8 and 20V8, if you use GALs for whatever reason you should design around those since most programmers support them. If you want to ONLY use GALs and no 74 series, it would be best to use 22V10 chips since they pack a lot more logic. That would be stupid though since the CPLD I suggested is a dozen times more flexible and easy to use than a handful of 22V10s!

<br />1 - You amercian have an easy acess to many things us european doesn't have unless we pay a lot more, so stop flaunting the low price available in america, because this tend to be annoying after a while.
<br />2 - Need for over 3 of each different VCC and GND pin, and sometimes (not always trough) with funky voltage like 3.3V is not what I call a standard power supply. Not mentionning all CPLDs are annoying  pseudo-modern SMD packages, wich I hate like hell.
