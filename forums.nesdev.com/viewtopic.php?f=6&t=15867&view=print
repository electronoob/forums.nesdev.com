		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ive been using the converted Super Mario Bros. 2 Japan .fds, within my Super Mario All-Stars NES game. I believe that the .FDS wavetable is intact within the converted .fds to .nes game.<br /><br />I used the emulator Nestopia, and used the cheat option to force me to star at 8-4 within the converted .fds to .nes rom. I defeated the game, and when you save Princess Toadstool it plays the ending theme. So I went to the sound option of the emulator, to shut off all the square, triangle, &amp; noise channels. I left the .FDS expansion audio on. <br /><br />Nothing was playing back.<br /><br />I used FCEUX's code data logger, and ive noticed that what appears to be the wavetable data is being loaded. I also went to nesdev wiki, to make sure the master address used to enable the .FDS playback is enabled, and it is within my game.<br /><br />Is there a reason as to why the .FDS audio is not playing within the emulator?

The main difference is that it doesn't have PRG-ROM, but RAM where to load programs from disc.

I just &quot;again&quot; assumed it was a system thing, the .fds, since all I've been hearing is that the nes front loader can output that audio via modification. I didn't realize the famicom cartridges contain enhancements like Konami &amp; Sunsoft. Although I'm perplexed again seeing the game I'm using was originally a DISK image and not from an actual famicom cartridge.<br /><br />I appreciate your help everyone, thank you.<br /><br />Oh with the HiDefNES. Yes there is a menu where you are able to turn on or off the different sound chips.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes it's possible to simulate the sound with PCM, or even DPCM, I suppose. It is an MMC5 hack, right? You have all sorts of advantages of IRQ and extra space at your disposal.<br /><br />I think probably the &quot;easiest&quot; thing would be to make DPCM samples, if you have space for them, and not have to worry about PCM timing.<br /><br />Your initial question was why emulators don't play your FDS sound (and the answer was simply that it's not an .FDS) but then you mentioned the Hi Def NES. From the description of how it works, it sounds like it <em>would</em> play your FDS sound if you enabled that option on the Hi Def. (Did you try it?)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah I kind of asked 2 questions within this thread I apologize. I understand what you all meant via the emulation aspect.<br /><br />Just now however, I defeated smb2j, on my all-stars mmc5 cart. And to my surprise, my HDMI NES outputted the .FDS sound at the end of the game when you rescue Princess Toadstool. I was able to toggle it off and on during that scene. So that is awesome to find out for myself. So I guess I'll just leave my current setup the way it is.
