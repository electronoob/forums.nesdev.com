<br />
<br />So just the cart by itself is rare enough (selling for about $25-$40), but a sealed copy is just crazy.  It's a lot better than Nintendo's version, I don't know what kind of dork would've kept the game sealed all that time.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I wouldn't pay much for it, but then again, almost all the carts in my collection are ones that I got for really cheap.

<br />Not really... we are not very fond of baseball here in Brazil... hell I don't even like soccer and it's the national sport! ;)
<br />
<br />I guess I do understand the collector's spirit, I also like to collect videogame stuff (older stuff, 3D is my brother's departament). But I know when the price is too high. I'd just spend the $300 on a few used consoles rather than ONE cartridge, even if sealed (wich does not really matter if you're going to open it anyway - and if you're not, why buy it?).
<br />
<br />Heh, you know, taste is taste. I'm not saying anyone is wrong or anything, I was just trying to understand how could ONE simple game be so important to cost what it does, AND still have people desiring it.
<br />
<br />See you later!

<br />It's a piece of Nintendo history, and it's an investment - It'll likely be worth more to someone in the future. And, no I wouldn't open it - If I really wanted to play the cart, I'd find a bare cart on ebay.

<br />Hum... I think that is just a bit sad. Hobbies are supposed to be fun... when you try to turn it into profit there is something wrong... I guess I can understand someone paying that much on a game if it was something he/she really wanted, and then he/she would enjoy it like hell, playing the game for weeks straight...
<br />
<br />But that's just me... I learned to value all the little bits of fun I get from my hobbies, and I think it is just sad to spend so much on a ornament for your shelf (maybe not even that, as the sun might burn the colors off the box), instead of using the money on something that will really bring you some enjoyment.
<br />
<br />Cheers.

<br />
<br />It's not that I wouldn't enjoy owning the game. My previous post was pointing out the future value justifies the initial cost. 
<br />
<br />Unfourtunatly money is often the bottom line. Hobbies that are profitable are often much more fun and worth while. As much as I'd love to own a sealed tengen tetris, I would part with it if my financial situtuation dictated as much. For now my financial situation dictates that I won't have to make that decision!

<br />
<br />($0.02)
<br />While I'm not into "shelf ornaments" myself, I have learned to appreciate that some folks just enjoy having a piece of history or nostalgia for themselves - I still have my old C64 and NES for almost that reason, although I do run them from time to time.
<br />
<br />While I wouldn't expect to see it in the Smithsonian any time soon, it  has some historical significance (with respect to the game industry) far beyond any other cart that sells for $$$ just becuase of nostalgia or low production numbers.
<br />
<br />Now I wouldn't pay money for this thing, but I can respect its place in things and just how rare it is.
<br />
<br />You have to take into consideration that, by all rights, it's not even supposed to exist.  The cart was recalled for *destruction* after Nintendo was done suing the pants off those guys.  Consider it the nexus of issues with Tetris licensing/piracy, unlicensed development of a NES game, reverse engineering, and legal fraud: using 10NES code for the lockout chip obtained from the USPTO.  You couldn't break more laws developing a game if you tried.
<br />
<br />And its available on ebay in its original box - as though none of the above ever happened.  I find it poetic and, yes, beautiful in that respect.

<br />A classfriend of mine has 5 copies of selead Final Fantasy VII at his home and he taught me that his actual plans are to wait years and years to sell them back very very expensive (note that the game has a great reputation, so his plans have chances to become true).
