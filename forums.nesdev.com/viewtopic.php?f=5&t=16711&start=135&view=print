Do you understand why I get so angry at people?</div><br />I'm sorry, what I meant was that your words in that thread more or less had the effect of a troll (which is also why that thread was locked). That's why I went on to clarify that I think you probably believed they were somewhat well-intentioned. I was pointing out that at face value they do not read as well-intentioned to me, or apparently to many people in that thread who felt directly insulted by you. I had to infer your intentions by the way you seemed to be shocked that someone might have called you an &quot;idiot&quot; at the end of that exchange.<br /><br />I think I do have some idea of why you get angry at people, but my question about that thread was precisely the converse: do <em>you</em> understand why people get so angry at <em>you</em>?<br /><br />If you can re-read that thread and think &quot;no, I said nothing at all insulting&quot;, then the answer to that question appears to be a negative. That's the &quot;point&quot; that you insist I don't have. There is a disconnect between how you think what you say should be received, and how it actually is, and it definitely appears to be causing you grief (as well as them). Do you want to understand why they reacted this way? Or do you just want to comfort yourself with a belief that they're all idiots?

You lead with that sour foot and it colours the context of everything else you said. After that bad opening, you did make some civil inquiries and the discussion looks like it's turning into something worthwhile, but then when you doubled back to it you can see the thread turn bad right there.

Fundamental part of its design and timings. Although you could make it so it takes in a clock at 2x speed and then use that to make the internal 2 phase, and then call it a 1 phase as far as the external circuity is concerned??

The fact it takes two makes me think it inverts then divs the other one to make the two clocks. Without seeing the dies though its all speculation. But it seems that it does take on faster clock in which it then clocks down to its internal speed. So I guess it could be seen as a 1phase 21Mhz or a 2Phase 10Mhz
