Still needs a little bit of work.<br />- Changed mapper to UxROM. I can easily switch between UxROM/MMC1 with compile-time settings.<br />- Fixed HUD faces to not use more than 8 sprites per scanline, they look perfect now.<br />- Smoke objects.<br />- Lots of bug fixes, big and small.<br />- Started working on the title screen.<br /><br />It should be smooth sailing from now on. The main things left to do are the title screen and the statistics screen etc when the game ends. I think it's realistic to say that the game will be out in the next couple of months.

Can't wait to see the finished project!</div><br />Thanks, I'm obviously very happy that I've been able to pull through this project, it hasn't always been easy. In fact, this project has shown me why it's no surprise that so few NES projects of this scale (or bigger) get finished. Making NES games is hard! With this project I of course had the advantage of having clear, precise goals (= the Flash game), so I always knew pretty well how the project was progressing. With projects built from scratch there tends to be a lot of uncertainty, but on the other hand they have the advantage of not having to worry about adapting stuff that may not fit the target system very well (in this specific case, the 320 px horizontal resolution, the way the levels were layered, etc).<br /><br />Anyway, the game is almost completely done now. All I have left is <s>high score saving</s>, credits and possibly adding some logos in there before the title screen. Then I'll take some time to add more polish, and we should be done here. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Looking forward to release, even though I've played the flash game many times. I am sure there are more like me who follow it. I hope the lack of replies hasn't kept you from working on it.<br /><br />I have been totally swamped at work this whole spring/summer, so I haven't had time to work on my own project. So it's always nice to check in on your progress. It keeps me motivated to finish my own game some day.

Seeing you make solid continual progress shows what's possible in a relatively short amount of time when you keep at it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> With this project I of course had the advantage of having clear, precise goals (= the Flash game)</div><br /><br />I kinda figured this has been beneficial to you with this project.  I had been considering holding off on doing much more until I fully defined my project, and your mention of it confirms my thoughts.  I also like the todo app you suggested awhile back, unfortunately my lists just keep getting longer instead of things getting done, must be a bug in the app somewhere...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for all the comments.<br /><br />I added high score saving, a placeholder logo before the title screen and shrunk the ROM from 256 KB (which I had been using for convenience) to 128 KB. I noticed the text scripts in their unpacked form take a lot of space, ~12 KB, but no point in trying to pack them at this point. The only thing left at this point is a credits scroller (and to actually figure out what to put in the credits...).<br /><br />I also sent Arthur Lee (author of the Flash version) an email, hopefully I can get in contact with him to clear a couple of things up about credits, copyrights, logos and other stuff.

I hope OAM cycling is part of the final polishing? Or you'd probably even prefer to have the score disappear completely rather than the player/obstacles flickering too much...<br /><br />Other than that, it looks/sounds just as cool as I hoped! Big congrats on sticking with this project!!

I'm guessing there is some grey area on rights to the material and such though?  I just dislike the idea of how all the greedy/pirate reproshops are going to make a killing off your work...  Might be a good selling point for the compo carts should they ever get published, but Tepples would have to move away from BNROM I guess.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Looking good!<br /><br />As far as rights to the material, I think thefox is relatively safe. The ideas taken from the original game are things that likely aren't copyrightable; does it go any farther than rope-shooting gameplay element, and the presence of clowns?<br /><br />The title itself could be a problem if Active Enterprises was maintaining some sort of trademark on it, but given that they don't seem to have done anything with it in 20 years, that's probably not the case.
