I've uploaded a video of me creating a project from scratch, building, and running it through the debugger:

<br />Screenshot is of the 32-bit linux version running in KDE, but it also can be compiled and ran on 64-bit linux, 32 and 64-bit windows, and intel based macs.

It will be in the Developer Documentation section of our wiki: <a href="http://wiki.nesicide.com/" class="postlink">http://wiki.nesicide.com/</a>
<br />
<br />For the howtos, I was thinking about doing videos originally, but decided that screenshots and detailed instructions would probably be better (the linux instructions will pretty much be copy-paste!).
<br />
<br />I'm also planning on fleshing out other sections of the wiki as well -- and if anyone has any suggestions please let me know; especially when we start adding content to the user manual.

<br />
<br />Building something under Debian, Ubuntu, or similar should ideally take four steps:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">sudo apt-get install build-essential some-package-dev some-other-package-dev<br />./configure<br />make -j2<br />sudo make install</div>
<br />Line 1: One major step with distributing something as source code involves figuring out exactly which -dev packages are needed on a stock Ubuntu Desktop installation.
<br />Line 2: Not all apps really need this step.
<br />Line 3: The -j2 runs two compile steps at once. It'll end up using one process for disk access and one for computing.

<br />
<br />I'm downloading ISO images of a lot of different operating systems so that I can ensure that the guide is grabbing all the packages that it should.

<br />
<br />cpow (NESICIDE) officially has the annotated super mario brothers source compiling and running perfectly in NESICIDE2 now; great job!
<br />
<br />I have just finished integrating lua into NESICIDE2, and have began work fleshing out the plugin subsystem.
<br />
<br />Now this isn't your momma's plugin system. Plugins can (and should) do everything from adding editors (be it primitive, or high level stuff like level editors for a specific game), to extending the compiler (both chr-rom and prg-rom) itself.
<br />
<br />For example, you may normally have to say:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.advance $FFFA<br />.dw NMI_Handler<br />.dw Reset_Handler<br />.dw $0</div><br /><br />But we may have a plugin that exposes a function that lets you code it like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">SetHandlers&#40;NMI_Handler, Reset_Handler, $0&#41;</div>
<br />
<br />Now obviously this specific example is overkill, but there is really no limit to what plugins can do as they can both hook fully into the compiler, as well as the IDE (it will even be able to create menus in the main IDE window). Plugins will also have the ability to look at, create, modify, delete, or otherwise manage any objects in the project (including objects created by other plugins).
<br />
<br />The idea is that although it is great and all that NESICIDE2 has all these debuggers -- in the end, it's the toolset that makes developing games easier. And although several games may share the same toolset, typically its unique per game. We plan on creating a few sets of plugins (exposed as templates when creating a new project) to help new users out; but if someone wanted to write a game from scratch in NESICIDE2 they would most likely write plugins for that game in order to make creating levels, script AI, build maps, etc very easy.
<br />
<br />Thoughts?

<br />
<br />The plugin system is based off of XML with lua scripting only -- it is platform independent as it is processed directly by nesicide2, and not any outside libraries. Although it is scripted, it will have a lot of functionality and access to the actual UI and compiler. It's kinda hard to explain without you actually seeing it in action.
