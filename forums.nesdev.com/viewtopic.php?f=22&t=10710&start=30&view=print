		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I guess the TD elements were more in the single-player mode of the game that inspired this game. I'll update things given that neither RHDE nor the 2-player mode of Rampart is very TD.<br /><br />In any case, my mental model of the furnish phase is that Stock is &quot;home&quot;. This is why the player presses B to return from pickup or Shop to Stock. In addition, most of what's available to be picked up is drawn higher on the screen than the Stock window, so Up kind of makes sense at least to me. Here's my conceptual map of the modes of the furnish phase:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&#91; Pickup/Place &#93;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ^<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; v<br />&#91; Stock &#93; &lt; &gt; &#91; Shop &#93;</div><br />How should I better get across that Stock is &quot;home&quot;?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not too certain that Pickup/Place is cleanly above Stock. For one thing attempting to move the cursor past the bottom of the screen doesn't return to the Stock (first thing I tried after I pressed up as instructed). That would be *very* cumbersome, thus overloading the rotation button was justifiable (it works out). Left and right worked OK for between Stock and Shop because the Shop is a vertically ordered list, and the Stock layout had an acceptable number of columns (4).<br /><br />For both the Placement and Stock modes all 4 directional buttons are use for cursor movement, so you would first try to use another button to switch modes. We know that at Stock pressing A selects the item and goes to Placement, so I think using B for selecting nothing and going to Placement might be a good counterpart.<br /><br />As for reimaging the mode map. I would think of Stock/Shop being one cursor and Pickup/Place being another, and B switches between the two.

I think you should go for a more minimalist approach, composed mainly by the bottom half of this picture (i.e. the text). Maybe include some graphical elements, but this scene, as is, is very unrepresentative of what NES games are about. Besides the execution, there's the fact that title screen art usually includes characters posing, not interacting with each other and oblivious to the camera. This looks weird.

Since mapper 28 doesn't have any way to protect CHR, you could just write over it as usual and treat it like RAM after the title screen. If the cart uses a CHR RAM size bigger than 8kb you could use mapper 28's CHR bank switching to preserve the title screen but I think it wouldn't matter if it could only be shown at the start, and even then you could probably do something hackish to relaunch the game and load the CHR ROM again.

Characters don't necessarily have to be posing as if they were taking a picture, a lot of times they are in the middle of an action scene, but they are prominently drawn in the first plane, like someone was trying to get a shot of their faces while the characters themselves didn't care.<br /><br />Your scene looks kinda like a child's drawing, all the characters are drawn from the side with little to no volume, the perspective on the road and houses is awkward, and the houses can barely be perceived as such. Perhaps you could make the perspective more interesting if you showed both the ground and the sky, with the ground slightly (or even not so slightly) suggesting earth's curvature. Some foliage would help too, everything is too flat. Characters could still be fighting, but they could be more tridimensionally distributed in the scene.<br /><br />Of course these are just suggestions, if you don't agree with them feel free to ignore them! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">RT-55J wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I feel that the picture would look better if the vanishing point was about 1/3 the way from the top instead of out of the frame.</div><br />Exactly, I miss the sky. This is a very awkward point of view for a title screen.
