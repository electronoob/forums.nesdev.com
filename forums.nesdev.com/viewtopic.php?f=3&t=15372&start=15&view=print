Think about all the people doing &quot;cracks&quot; for modern games; they deal with this stuff on a regular basis, and succeed. The assembly code produced for modern platforms can be a little bit more complicated, but a lot of the methods for disassembling and understanding it are basically the same. Modern platforms tend to have good debugging tools, too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">madmega wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">is the effort really worth is, when you can just play the game on another emulator ?</div><br />Yes, but this is the Mini NES we are talking about, there is as we speak no option to alter the emulator.</div><br />The reminds me of another option: replace the NES mini software entirely with a different emulator that already supports it. That's probably a lot easier than trying to hack functionality into the existing one.<br /><br />Edit: Fisher just suggested this above, more or less. Missed the extra page, apparently.

You get used to the relevant libraries with experience. (A lot of hacks and mods are actually done by replacing DLLs, too, since it's a clean connection point to change something with known functionality.)<br /><br />I mean, I'm not saying that modern code isn't bigger and more complex than 6502 code, just by the size of executables alone you can see there's a lot more in there nowadays, but to make small changes you only have to understand a small part of it. It's a fairly manageable problem, and there exist good tools for this kind of work.<br /><br />If you're not experienced with the system, there's a lot to learn at first, but this is equally true if someone inexperienced in NES development wanted to attempt a VRC4 to MMC3 hack.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">madmega wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If someone wants to help the author of hakchi2, he has no skills in fully disassemble the emulator of the Mini NES.</div><br />I really was only answering the question asked (i.e. &quot;what's the difficult way to do it?&quot;). I wasn't making any offer to actually do the work. I don't own an NES mini and didn't want one precisely because of the problem you're having now with it.
