I forgot to ask, is it going to have a Famicom or NES cart port?  I mean, if you are going to recreate everything exactly in hardware, you might as well recreate every expansion port and cartridge port... not for dumping, but just to make it a complete recreation of the original, with full support of all peripherials.<br /><br />Then games could be played off of cart or flash.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Mon Dec 13, 2004 7:14 am</p><hr />

What do you mean by "before MMC5"?  As far as I know, there was only one way to map the FDS games, right?  I mean, they didn't have different versions of the RAM adapter that supported new stuff or anything (though that could've been kinda cool and extended the FDS' life maybe, provided it wasn't too expensive).  Do you just mean it's simpler to do than MMC5?<br /><br />Sorry about my ignorance regarding the FDS RAM adapter before.  It makes some amount of sense that it'd be sort of emulating mapper 0 to the system, and I take it it just spools the data the Famicom would need then from the disk?<br /><br />Were there really a lot of multi-DISK games?  I know a bunch of games were dual-sided, but I've only seen a couple of games that require more than one disk.  (I live in Kobe, Japan, so the FDS is still available somewhat here ^_^)  I'm really learning a lot though, so I'm glad people are responding.  Thanks for all of your input!<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Tue Dec 07, 2004 1:37 am</p><hr />

One could easily emulate a FDS (before MMC5) but of course it'll require a flexible system due to the FDS's odd mapping. There are quite a few old Taiwanese FDS hardware emulators which are basically RAM adapters which play cartridges and swap sides via a pushbutton.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Mon Dec 06, 2004 8:28 pm</p><hr />

Well, I'm sorry for coming up with an unoriginal idea.  Actually, I am quite aware of what a pain in the ass it would be.  But the main idea was that it would only need to be done once, and once it was done hopefully many would benefit.  I didn't mean to insinuate that I knew better than anyone else, either, I was just openly theorizing how I would implement certain features to make sure they would work (to be honest, since I'm not too sure how CF is addressed, it might not even need RAM to buffer to).  Regardless, I thought it would be a fun thing to do, but Kevin Horton has indeed beaten me to the punch (because quite honestly, the man is a genius).<br /><br />I'm not sure exactly why making mapper hardware is harder than emulating it in software- from what I understand, VHDL can be coded just like a regular programming language.<br /><br />BTW, I meant CPLD I think when I said FPGA.  Since I'm not an electrical engineer I tend to get those sorts of terms mixed up.<br /><br />Anyway, glad to hear that I wasn't completely off-base in thinking it could be done.  Thanks for your feedback, all.<br /><br />FDS support would not be very difficult to add, actually.  It'd be hard to actually run the FDS disks themselves, but emulating that would be like emulating any other mapper, really.  Everyone thinks the FDS is so special, but it's really not.  IIRC, the disk is completely stored on the RAM adapter before it's run, which would make that quite easily emulated.  Or at least, not really any harder than anything else. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Mon Dec 06, 2004 4:42 am</p><hr />
