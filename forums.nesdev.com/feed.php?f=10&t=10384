Unless you're looking for fancy effects, character bankswitching animation and other tricks I suggest you to use UNROM/UOROM, there's even a tutorial on NintendoAge, it's really easy and can hold 8/16x 8kb banks. However you have to copy the tiles from ROM to Character RAM, but that shouldn't be a problem. Battle Kid uses <s>UNROM</s> EDIT: it's UOROM, plus there are cheap, unwanted games like Microprose's SILENT SERVICE that are also easy to find that you can use to make your own carts.<br /><br />You can build a simple platformer, or a strategy game, or a puzzle game, it's up to you really, just don't try to add too much complexity on your game or you will get frustrated.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5877">Punch</a> — Sat Aug 17, 2013 10:26 am</p><hr />

It may help to go over some source code, both homebrew and commercial disassemblies.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4680">Movax12</a> — Sat Aug 17, 2013 10:15 am</p><hr />

OK all, <br /><br />Starting in January this year I made my first NES project. It was called Ninja Slapper and it was basically PONG but with you're guy's help I took it a little farther. It had animation on the characters, title and ending screens, and full sound engine from Metal Slime and the music was composed by me. <br /><br />I had a blast doing it and then took some time off to start learning Python, however in the midst of learning Python I realized I just wasn't enjoying Python all that much so I want to go back to NESASM.<br /><br />The problem is, I don't know where to start to take my skills further. For PONG I had a nice little spring board in the Nerdy Nights Tutorials. Now I think I want to do a side scroller with a mapper but I don't really know how to go about getting started on that? I know many of you on this board have learned how to write such code and better. How did you get started?<br /><br />Any and all suggestions would be great. <br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />-M<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5027">mysteriousity</a> — Sat Aug 17, 2013 9:31 am</p><hr />
