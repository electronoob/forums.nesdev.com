		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello, long time lurker here, but this is my first time posting.<br /><br />I recently built a homemade SNES Cartridge reader using MCP23017 expander chips for the Raspberry Pi:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://familab.org/blog/2012/12/snes-super-nintendo-emulated-system/">http://familab.org/blog/2012/12/snes-su ... ed-system/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I have broken out the IO from the center 46-pin connector, and have read write access to all of the lines with the exception of the CIC pins.<br /><br />Using Python, I am able to read almost every SNES title I throw at it, with the exception of Mega Man X2. I am guessing this has something to do with the CX4 chip. Checking my ripped image against a downloaded copy of the game seems to suggest that the first 1,048,576 bytes of data is identical. The next 249,422 bytes of data is a mirror from the beginning, as far as I could tell. The rest of the data I can't say. <br /><br />Do I have to do additional steps to read CX4 games other than incrementing through banks and addresses? Such as, is there game data that I HAVE TO read through CX4 commands?<br /><br />I am aware that the CIC lock is needed for SA1 games, but outside some passing comments on this forum, I am unable to determine if it is needed as well for CX4 games. As you know, finding this information on the web is increasingly rare. I have the desire to use the Super CIC lock chip for SA1 games, but I have no idea how it will behave outside of an actual SNES. Does the SNES provide the Super CIC with a clock source I'd have to emulate outside of the console? Anyone with experience would be greatly appreciated!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Maybe the banks are mapped in a way you don't expect. What address/bank do you dump from? The game is 12 megabits I think. So the first 8 megs was ok but you don't see the last 4 megs? I've never heard of anything with the Cx4 preventing you from reading ROM. Unless the Cx4 chip is executing and stopping the cartridge from responding or something like that. You're reading from $8000-$FFFF of each bank right?

I've been afraid to turn the data lines into outputs as if the cart is outputting say a HIGH 5v, and my reader sends a 0v to the same line, wouldn't that be a direct path? Do SNES carts have protection for such things? I know you could use the /WR /RD and /CS lines for writing to SRAM, but haven't had to yet.<br /><br />From <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.emulatronia.com/doctec/consolas/snes/sneskart.html">http://www.emulatronia.com/doctec/conso ... skart.html</a><!-- m -->:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">read ROM   /RD, /CS, RESET low<br />           /WR high<br />read SRAM  /CS, /RD low<br />           RESET, /WR high<br />           A15, BA4, BA5 high<br />write SRAM /CS, /WR low<br />           RESET, /RD high<br />           A15, BA4, BA5 high</div><br /><br />Would this be similar to writing to SRAM? Do I place /CS and /RW LOW, and /RD HIGH?<br /><br />One last thing. You said to write to offset $007f52. Is that assuming A15 is held high? This is a LoROM title, after all.<br />As it is writing to addr 0x7f52 with loROM in my code will write to 0xFF52 as it will OR 0x8000 to the value. I have complete control, though.

I found that $007f52 read 1 in Mega Man X 2. I was able to write to it, change it to 0, and that did the trick. I suppose if Mega Man X3 is 8megs, going by your analysis the value should be kept at 1.<br /><br />To write to the register, I held /RD and RESET high, and held /CS, and /WR low. I changed direction of the data I/O to output, and wrote the value, and then changed the control values back, and ripped. The checksums match now. This should be stickied. I searched the web after you made your post, and I still couldn't find any information elsewhere on this register. If it's out there, provide me with a link. If I missed it I'd like to know so I could Google better next time.

No big deal.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Well now that you can write, you can also dump S-DD1 and SPC7110 boards. Throw in a SuperCIC and you can dump SA-1 boards. Do that, and you'll have a fantastic product to sell :D
