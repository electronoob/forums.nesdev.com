<br />
<br />But seriously, I break my projects down into many source files, each implementing only a function or two.  I use a single top-level Makefile to handle building my own pre-processors (for text, graphics, etc...) and to drive the use of ca65 / ld65 and any post-processing steps.
<br />
<br />I know that other assemblers can handle a single top-level source file that just "#includes" the rest of the project, but I find that kinda sloppy.
<br />
<br />Now my coworkers keep telling me that "Ant" is superior to "make".  It probably is, but I don't need those ant features, and I surely don't want a hugely bloated JVM to be a build-chain dependency.
<br />
<br />ps- for anyone who likes the makefile approach, I highly recommend reading the article "recursive makefiles considered harmful": <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://miller.emu.id.au/pmiller/books/rmch/">http://miller.emu.id.au/pmiller/books/rmch/</a><!-- m -->

<br />This is exactly what I do. I have a pretty complex file/folder structure that keeps things easy to find and manage, and prevents thousand-line long source files.
<br />
<br />Thanks for the CA65 config example, I'll take a better look at it later. I don't feel like I'm missing anything by using ASM6 though, it's just that I can see that CA65 is a pretty decent piece of software, so it would be nice to be able to use it in addition to ASM6, like some of you guys are doing.

<br />
<br />My only problem with NESASM is that once in a while people face unpleasant surprises with it, because of some nasty silent bug that causes the program to generate a bad binary instead of reporting the problem. I can't possibly understand why someone would choose to take this risk.

<br />
<br />Yes, this definitely needs fixing. Absolute pain in the ass sometimes.
<br />
<br />Other than that, CA65 for me. It does take a little more effort to initially get set up but it's worth that effort. I have blargg to thank for guiding me through the pain <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />OH! cool!  I think I've encountered that bug...it seemed to occur when I would assemble an UNROM program while an emulator window was still open, and the nes file would come out corrupt. Well it's good to know that NESASM has those kinds of problems...still, I prefer it simply because out of all assemblers that I've attempted to use, I've never succeeded in producing a .NES file with anything else. Maybe my syntax was just incorrect, or commands improperly entered. I just stick to what works for me.

<br />
<br />In my case, the version of nesasm I used would not assemble any bytes past the 72nd or 80th column or so. The tools I use to generate data for my game generate gigantic .db statements for data rather than binary files. Once I modified these to wrap to less than 72 characters wide, I got a correctly assembling rom. Even so, that bug scared me off of nesasm. I haven't had any problems with P65, ASM6, or CA65, and finally settled on CA65 due to overall development style preferences, and some of the syntactic conveniences it offers. If you haven't gotten correctly assembling roms with more than one assembler, it may still be useful to keep trying until you do...I know in my case once I finally "got it" on how assemblers work, they all made sense to me, including CA65, giving me the freedom to choose based on style alone.
<br />
<br />*edit* I now believe the only thing that truly makes CA65 less convenient than other assemblers is that depending on how you organize your code you may need to compile multiple source files, and then link them all together. But the process is very straightforward and can be easily abstracted away with a batch file or a makefile.
