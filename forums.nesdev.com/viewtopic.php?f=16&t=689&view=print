		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />One of the big things that was deterring me from adding stuff to the wiki was this line on the main page:
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If you're adding content, please focus on documenting things which aren't already well documented; if it's already documented, just provide a link. A goal of this site is a coherent organization of information already available</div>
<br />
<br />I guess I see the point behind this mentality, but at the same time I don't really agree with it.
<br />
<br />To me, the wiki seems like it should be a living, all-in-one massive reference.  Rather than just a compilation of various links to offsite pages.  I mean... if someone just wants a compilation of links to various docs... they'd go to the main nesdev page.
<br />
<br />Not to mention you can't make minor corrections/clarifications to pages if the wiki is just linking to some other doc.  So that takes away all the flexibility and control of having a wiki.
<br />
<br />I don't see the harm in copy/pasting chunks of info from existing docs.  If credit is an issue we could tack on a "contributors" or "sources" section at the bottom.  In fact the sources section could even link those off-site pages...  in addition to having it available for viewing/modification on the wiki.
<br />
<br />Imagine doing a search on wikipedia... only to receive links to brittanica and other encyclopedia sites.  Makes you kind of wonder what the point is =P

<br />
<br />It would be a good idea to switch to a different Wiki if we're going to attempt to do it right this time, as this would be a "bottleneck" as far as content goes. I really hope we can discuss the overall plan before jumping in, each with his own idea of how to do things.

<br />...and THAT was some completely pointless spam. Along with your other 4 junk posts.  If you don't have anything useful to say, then go away.

<br />Seriously, that's what I'm wondering.  I just did a google search, and a lot of the other "this is actually what my theisis was based upon" posts had links to stupid casinos in their signature.  Looks like we've foiled them here by allowing them to post as guests with no sigs. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />The other way to foil them is not to let Googlebot and other popular search engine bots' user agents see signatures.

<br />Yep, and I think some people already made some mods that prevent non-logged in users from viewing the member list.  I dunno if it's in the normal distribution yet.
<br />
<br />On a related note, I had a scare the other day when I looked on the 'who's online now'  list and saw about 50 guests "posting a message" all from the same IP.  I freaked out, then I looked it up later and found out it was just Google's spider.  heheh.
