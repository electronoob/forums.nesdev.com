		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here's a simple approach:<br /><br />mode 0: 4 4bpp BGs<br />mode 1: 2 4bpp BGs and 1 8bpp affine layer<br /><br />Every non-affine layer will have offset-per-tile available, and disabled backgrounds will be replaced with open DMA access slots.  Not only would it have time to fetch sprite patterns during h-blank, but it also would have time to fetch sprite attributes too.<br /><br />I don't really care that much about 8bpp other than it made mode-7 possible.  4bpp just has a more authentic 16-bit feel to it.  Now that I'm at it, why not change it to packed pixel format?

Were there any computers around at the time that used 70ns or faster RAM?  I know that the Sega Saturn had 28Mhz VRAM accesses, but that was 4 or 5 years later.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hm, 1990 predates DEC's Alphas. Everyone else (POWER, SPARC, i860, 88k, ARM) seemed to be pretty comparable in 1990 (ca. 30MHz).<br />I do remember some systems using funny RAMs, but for the most part, UNIX workstations were mostly using stock DRAM, usually just put in enough parallel to fetch a 32-bit or 64-bit word all at once. (So, not faster)<br /><br />For speed, I suspect it's just economies of scale, with a lower sales opportunity and stricter requirements for faster parts.

This &quot;seek time&quot; was common in &quot;fast page mode&quot; DRAMs, which loaded a whole word-line into a small buffer; other accesses within the same word-line had less penalty.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />SRAMs used for cache chips don't have any speed penalties, not on the async ones which were ofter 10, 12 or 15ns. Later synchronous SRAMs do have &quot;latency&quot;, it takes one cycle to set address, and remaining cycles can be used as reads or writes.<br />I tried to find any pricing info on cache chips you'd use on a 486 or mayhaps a 36 mobo but could not find any... those are vanilla async SRAM, but much faster than what you would find in a game console, but still may be useful for some ideas.

I'm asking because it would've made sense to design a system with every chip clocked to the same frequency, including the dot clock, and 6.136Mhz would've gave you square pixels.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You'd still need a master clock of 945/44 = 21.48 MHz to generate the 3.58 MHz color subcarrier. You'd divide it by 7 instead of 6 or 8 to get the 3.07 MHz CPU clock, but you'd need to divide it by 1.75 to get the 12.28 MHz half-pixel clock used by hires mode. And to avoid unsightly side borders, you'd need to redesign nametable layouts around a 288px wide display plane, which means nametables would have to be 64x32 cells.<br /><br />Arcade and other RGB systems have a lot more freedom with their <a href="https://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=Dot_clock_rates" class="postlink">dot clock rates</a> because they aren't tied to crystals that are multiples of 3.58 MHz.
