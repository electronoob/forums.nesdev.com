I have to unfortunatley agree with Quitetust, donknotts you are really an annoying guy. Replying to old thread isn't bad if you really figure something out about the exact same thread, and then want to update it to update a new information, question, answer or whatever that has been said before, even if it was long before.<br />However, doing it too much can become annoying, because it will fake the order in wich threads are ordered, and because if what you're saying is only half related with the original thread, you sometimes would better to create a new fresh one.<br /><br />But that's not too much an annoyance. The real annoyance is posting a huge quantity of post of low quality that are quite often out of the subject. General stuff board can in theory allow any subject, but that is not a reason to create about 10 new threads or unrelated answer to old threads in one day, and the fact that the posts in question are confusing and meaningless, especially to people like me that aren't natal english speakers, doesn't help.<br /><br />Now, whoever you are :<br />- Don't make meaningless posts. Write *sentences* with a cappital letter at the begining of each sentences and punctuation. That isn't hard, and that makes the life of non-natal english speakers like me easier. Misspeling aren't too annoying (I do a lof of them myself), but non-sentences are.<br />- Explain youreself, and begin by saying what you're talking about in global before going to details<br />- Answer to defeated topics only if you really think what you post is the sequel to what have been said before. If it is not, make a new thread.<br />- Make your thread titles are clear and self-explainly as possible<br />- Avoid posting 10 crazy "general" topics per day. You should talk about NESdev in priority. You don't HAVE to, but this is still a NESdev board. You should ask "urgent" questions first. If you want to chat with other people about something else, you can talk about anything else in the general board, but don't make 10 topics per day, because it is just annoying.<br />- I also hate stupid rules, but those aren't stupid rules, they are basic behaviour recomandations.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon May 29, 2006 8:56 am</p><hr />
