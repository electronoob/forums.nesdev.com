<br />Well there's a least one, I just sent mine in.  Can you tell us how many other entries you've got so far?

<br />I would have loved to participate, but other projects are currently taking all my time. I hope there will be more compos in the future that accept NES submissions.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, I'm looking forward to seeing the entries of this compo.

<br />
<br />A compo seems interesting but for my case, yes, the fact that it's a puzzle game didn't help since I'm not a fan of the genre.  Except for that, time constraints and my tools are not ready so I  may have not been able to participate.

<br />Yeah, I *am* interested in the compo, even if I couldn't finish <a href="http://drag.wootest.net/misc/ball.nes" class="postlink">my entry</a>* in time. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> Maybe I'll have a better shot for the next time, if there is one. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />* This is supposed to be a puzzle where there's a ball, and you need to arrange the board in such a way that there's a path for the ball to fall from an indicated cell on the top to a goal on the bottom. I'm still lacking the ball and a whole bunch of other stuff. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> So yes, I'm not making anything up, I really did indeed attempt to make something for the compo. ;P

<br />Oh man you need to finish that game! That is super wicked. Let me know if you want my physics src before I release my demo <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I'm sure you could come up with a quick physics engine though.

<br />
<br />for all the others: we basically thought that "puzzle/logic" genre is quite simple to realize, obviously we were wrong. in the next compo i try to have a "general" topic again. in fact it was also a bit of an experiment. even after eight or nine(?) compos you can't learn enough <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
