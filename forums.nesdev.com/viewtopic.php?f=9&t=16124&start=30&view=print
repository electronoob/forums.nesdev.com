How odd.<br /><br />Interestingly, the game doesn't seem to ever explicitly drive SPI data; something must be pulling the node high in order for the SPI ADC to get its required &quot;start&quot; bit. (And then, since there's no obvious way to get the data line to change, it must be clocking in &quot;1 1&quot; for &quot;single-ended conversion&quot; and &quot;pin 3=Ch1&quot;)<br /><br />The ADC code is:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; LDA #0<br />&nbsp; LDY #$FF<br />&nbsp; STA $C002 ; chip select falls<br />&nbsp; STA $C003 ; SPI clock falls<br />&nbsp; STY $C003 ; rises; clock in start bit here<br />&nbsp; STA $C003 ; falls<br />&nbsp; STY $C003 ; rises; clock in 1:Single or 0:differential here<br />&nbsp; STA $C003 ; falls<br />&nbsp; STY $C003 ; rises; clock in (Single:1:Ch1 or 0:Ch0) or (Differential:1:Ch1 minus Ch0 or 0:Ch0 minus Ch1)<br />&nbsp; STA $C003; falls<br />&nbsp; LDX #8<br />-<br />&nbsp; STY $C003; rises<br />&nbsp; STX $C003 ; falls; data now valid<br />&nbsp; LDA $6003 ; read data<br />&nbsp; ASL A<br />&nbsp; ROL $00<br />&nbsp; DEX<br />&nbsp; BNE -<br />&nbsp; LDA #$80<br />&nbsp; STA $C002 ; raise chip select<br /></div>and it only runs at 60Hz.<br /><br />The other interesting bit is that the cart <strong>doesn't mix in the audio from the 2A03</strong>. All the sound can only come from the FM synthesizer.<br /><br />—<br /><br />To check for an expansion cart, the game checks for a sixteen-byte header (&quot;OPEN FAMILY SONG&quot;) mapped at $8000 in the very first bank, and if present, will JSR to $8010. It's possible in intercept NMI partway through by feeding an invalid value to one of the jump table indexes (after it's already done a bunch of random other things). IRQs will cause a spinlock—the IRQ vector points to an RTI.

I think it's possible that they could all have subtle differences in the patch set.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.msxpro.com/fm.html" class="postlink">Here's a page</a> in Brazilian Portuguese that has recording of both the UM3567 and the YM2413 and I don't hear any difference... but I wouldn't trust my ears to be anything resembling authoritative.
