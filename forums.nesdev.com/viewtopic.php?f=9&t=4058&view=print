		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, im new to this forum, I reacently got interested in making repro NES games of translated nes roms, I didn't knew this was possible, I got my NES fixed and been buying old games.  I have some dupe nes titles I would use as Donor boards, and I would like to know if there is a step by step tutorial on how to build a repro cartridge from scratch. I would need to buy all the materials including the solder.  I always wanted to do soldering projects and I learn fast <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I would preffer to do this myself instead of buying them, its more fun. I saw a site selling nes flash cart but I preffer building individually. they also sell some boards and chips.
<br />
<br />So any help will be appreciated! thanks!

Also I noticed you had the game divided in 2 files the CHR and the PRG is there a program that I can use to divide a .NES game into those 2 .BIN files? many thanks

<br />
<br />You can find EPROM programmers alot of places. But be careful when choosing one. Make sure it'll work with your system and the type of eprom you have.
<br />
<br />If you are just interested in playing the games though I recommend you get a PowerPAK.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, the EPROM programmer I got says that it successfully copies data to the EPROMs, but I've never got them to work in my NES. My soldering skills weren't a problem, I think it was the EPROMs. I've taken chips out, put mine in, they didn't work, and I put the originals back in, which worked with my soldering job. It might have something to do with the fact that it's a USB powered programmer, and doesn't require an adapter, which I heard is a big problem. So be careful when purchasing one; you probably want one that comes with an adapter.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Heya! thanks for the replies, I just placed an order on a HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER to be the donor cart for the Contra project. Today I'm going to buy soldering equipment at radio shack to start practicing soldering and de-soldering on some old motherboards I have round here.
<br />
<br />Now im looking at some auctions for a EPROM programmer and I saw this one:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/27C256-PCB5-0-C-Willem-EPROM-Programmer-PIC-FLASH-MCU_W0QQitemZ290224022602QQihZ019QQcategoryZ4661QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem" class="postlink"><strong>[EPROM Programmer on ebay</strong></a>
<br />
<br />It says it can program the following:
<br />
<br />27C16、27C32、27C64、27C128、27C256、27C512、27C010、27C020、27C040、27C1001, M27C1001、M27C2001、M27C4001
<br />27C080，M27C801，M87C257, 2716(Vpp25V)、2732、2764、27128、27256、27512、27010, Vpp12.5V (21Vpp Modify Circuit)
<br />
<br />It this one a good programmer? Im new to this, sorry if I ask so much, Im running windows XP pro also my hardware is a Intel core 2 duo with 2GB ram on an Intel BadAxe 1 Motherboard here is the technical information of my motherboard, I don't know if this programmer is compatible with it:
<br />

<br />Thanks for the help!

<br />hi! since I'm going to work on this project for learning I dont know what type of EPROMS i'll need but the ones mentioned by Bregalad on his project are 2x27C1001, how much would 4 of this cost? just in case I damage some ;p

<br />
<br />I did the whole comparison thing, and it says that the data successfully was copied to the chip... It could be my settings for the parallel port or something. I never knew what everyone was talking about with that.
<br />
<br />These are the steps to doing it, correct?
<br />
<br />1. Get the right size chip
<br />2. Split the PRG and CHR data and remove the header
<br />3. Copy the PRG/CHR to the appropriate chips
<br />4. Install them into the board considering the differences in pinouts between the EPROMs and the original chips
<br />
<br />Well next time I'll probably get those things where you can just stick the chip right into the board instead of having to solder it in.
<br />
<br />You know, I really am starting to think it's with my parallel port, because my CopyNES didn't work either...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />But the Willem can do so much more, and costs less... You should not fear the switches. The store sends you a sheet explaining all the different jumper settings for the different chips (there are not that many jumper settings), and the software will tell you how to setup the switches when you select the type of chip you want to program. There is no way to get it wrong if you pay attention.
<br />
<br />The only serious problem I can see about the Willem is the use of the parallel port, some people seem to have trouble with that. My Willem has worked fine on my 2 previous PCs, I haven't tested it on my new one though. I program mostly FlashROMs, and sometimes EEPROMs, and the USB power cable works fine, but it really seems like you need an actual power adapter if you plan on programming EPROMs.

Its easy to use, the software tells you how to set the dip switches and jumpers for the chips you are programming. I am using a Win98se laptop and have no issues, but for the eproms you need the external 12vdc power supply to get the right Vpp.
