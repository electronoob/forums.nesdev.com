<div class="quotetitle">Canite wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />What happens when the CPU gets to the end of the code?<br /></div><br />Real programs will always JMP back at some point, because all programs are loops that repeatedly check input and take actions based on that input, over and over and over.<br /><br />However, if you forget to tell the CPU to JMP back, it will just keep going. If there's data (such as level maps, screen layouts, music, whatever) after the code, the CPU will try to execute those as if they were part of the program, which will most likely result in a crash. If it reaches the end of the ROM ($FFFF) without crashing, I believe the program counter wraps back to $0000 (since it's only 16 bits wide), at which point the CPU will try to execute whatever is stored in RAM as a program. Since we usually have variables there, not programs, the chances of crashing are fairly high too. <br /><br />Anyway, at some point it will crash for sure, so you must take care to never let the program counter run free like this. Always program all sections of your games as loops.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Jun 29, 2011 6:55 pm</p><hr />

Yep, was supposed to be BEQ, changed now. -facepalm-<br /><br />But anyway, yes, it runs them in order unless a branch or jump happens.

Labels denote only the start of a block of code. You have to keep track of the end yourself, either by indentation, by leaving a blank line (as 3gengames mentioned), or by syntax highlighting branch instructions.<br /><br />In ca65 there are the .proc and .endproc keywords to mark the start and end of a subroutine (and create a new namespace for labels used inside the subroutine), but .endproc doesn't automatically insert the RTS instruction at the end.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Jun 29, 2011 3:40 pm</p><hr />

I leave a lot of space, about 3-5 lines, between sections of code. For subroutines, like reading the controller and screen uploading programs, I have a file for each one and put them all in between the main engine and the NMI, since they're subroutines and not needed in the beginning, so it seems most logical for me. Like this:<br /><br /><br />RESET:<br />;Reset junk<br />JMP LoopEngine<br /><br /><br />.include "ReadControllers.asm"<br />.include "UploadScreen.asm"<br />.include "UploadPalettes.asm"<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />NMI:<br />NMI stuff<br />RTI<br /><br /><br />All the includes are not the main engine, but subroutines it uses, so I just include them after inbetween the main engine and the NMI. You can put them in the beginning or after the NMI, as long as you don't include them in middle of other program, haha. You can do stuff like this too:<br /><br />;//////////////////////////////////////////////<br />;Comment line, this code does X<br />;//////////////////////////////////////////////<br /><br />Or anything like that. I don't do that much though. I may label some pointers, but that's it. I rarely do any labeling of my code.

ReadyLoop is pretty much getting ready to wait for the next INC of Frame to jump, so it's just the name I named it to get ready to loop until the next frame, which it knows happened because Frame won't match with A.<br /><br />RTI brings you back to where the program was before the NMI happened, which is in the loop waiting for the next frame.<br /><br />PHA and PLA are PusH A and PuLl A from the stack, if you change A in the NMI, you need to save it, so I saved it there in the NMI, since NMI doesn't save the registers, just the processor status, so you need to save those manually with PHA in the beginning and PLA at the end.<br /><br />NMI is the VBlank trigger, and it goes to the NMI label because that's what you tell it to do from the vector. It can go to any label, it's probably best though to call the NMI label NMI so you don't confuse it with some other intterupt like IRQ.<br /><br />And the fox did make that one change, but at the same time, every NMI you have to LDA $2002 to "acknowledge" the NMI, or else weird things will happen if you don't and mess with the PPU and it can get stuck and cause havok, because it'll keep NMI'ing. But anyway, you'll LDA $2002 in the beginning of each NMI, So you need to PHA before that in the beginning of the NMI, LDA $2002 after, and then PLA before the RTI for that loop I showed you to work.<br /><br />And on a side note: You edit the screen/palette and upload sprites in VBlank, so it's important not to do any game engine stuff like move enemies there, you do that during the frame in the main logic loop. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Hope this makes some sense.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Wed Jun 29, 2011 3:00 pm</p><hr />
