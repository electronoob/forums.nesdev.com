		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />ca65 is the way to go, not only because of debug features. It provides linker, it will allow to configure memory for various mappers, and, which is important, reuse existing code, like sound engines. Without ca65 support you'll get a lot of extra work to regain this features, especially if you choose binary output without intermediate assembly source output.<br /><br />As for syntax, I'm pretty sure there is room for both C-like and Basic-like. The latter is an important thing to lower the entry barrier for (absolute, no prior programming experience) newcomers, it works well, as we can see in cases with bAtari basic and BasiEgaXors. C is obviously better choice for those who already know C or use CC65 and want to have a better option, without changing too much in existing code base.

I have it in my compiler generator notes, I guess I just took notes from a compiled assembly file.<br /><br />So far I've got no working code due to me trying to settle on a code organization style (for the language, not the compiler), and trying to finish the second quest of the Legend of Zelda <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I am trying to avoid having to use forward declarations, but at the same time not have to compile all the code in one shot.

I missed some pretty big requirements during design and it's pretty unworkable now. At least I'll be able to reuse some of the code.<br /><br />This was the first time I've tried to write a single-pass compiler, so I was expecting some level of failure.

I personally didn't do some serious NES development for Atalan, as the platform of my heart is Atari 800 <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> There is some NES specific support however (for example specific support for PPU reading).<br /><br />However I cannot promise any date, when the Atalan will be available in some stable version <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />I believe C is not good match for 6502. There are many features in the language, that are impossible to implement effectively on 6502. Portability of any 8-bit platform game to some other platform will be very limited (except for text based games), so that's not an interesting feature.<br /><br />Rudla
