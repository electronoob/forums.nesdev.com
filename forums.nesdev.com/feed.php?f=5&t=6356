The problem is not really to make the CSS, it's because I'm overriding the original one with the help of the CSS plugin I think. IE6 doesn't seem to like it much. I just wanted to avoid to create a new theme just for those pages since I don't know if you can force a theme for a group of page or not yet. <br /><br />I think I will need to do more research on the subject.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Thu May 06, 2010 5:37 pm</p><hr />

I once managed to get lucky, and make CSS that worked with modern browsers, and still worked on IE5/5.5/6.  No conditionals anywhere.  Didn't work so great on IE4 though.<br /><br />There's a tool called MultpileIEs that gives you IE4/IE5/IE5.5 and IE6 side by side so you can test your site on each browser.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Thu May 06, 2010 12:18 pm</p><hr />

Or use "if lt IE 7" conditional comments to hide offending CSS from IE 6 and earlier.

There is 2 version of it: <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Nesdev" class="postlink">this one</a> which as the same style as the wiki and the one you tried to edit.<br /><br />The only problem with the one that look like nesdev is that I override some of the CSS to make it look as much as possible as the original nesdev page. The problem with that is older browser that doesn't support CSS well (cough! IE6 cough!)... It comes out not properly. I didn't have time yet to figure out a solution for this.<br /><br />As for the table, I don't know. It doesn't bring much yet. What I wanted to do (long time ago) when I proposed to update the main page too is that instead of having 1 huge page is to separate it by section that you can select form a menu on the top or left. <br /><br />Still, for now I think the first goal should be to make that page more accessible to edit by the community (similar to what I did when the previous wiki server was failing all the time) so the content would be more up to date. Then after we can think on how to make it look better, content wise, color wise, organization wise.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Wed May 05, 2010 5:07 pm</p><hr />

One thing I always really wanted, was a comments system for individual files.  I couldn't see a good way to do it, other than manually making a bunch of topics in a forum or something (which would suck when the forum inevitably migrates).  Or putting the site on one of those 'content management' type setups, but IMHO most of the sites I've seen using that kind of stuff is pretty ugly (not that the current, old html is nice looking, but it is easily accessible at least).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed May 05, 2010 4:26 pm</p><hr />
