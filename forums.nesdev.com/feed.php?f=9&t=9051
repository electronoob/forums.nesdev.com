I know I'm a little slow to chip in, but I finally got Internet access back again and had to chime in.<br /><br />I agree that if someone really wants to crack your copy protection they will.  But for home brews I can see how the author would want to discourage the act.  In reality most of the people with the NES specific knowledge are already on this board and I think we as a community wouldn't share a hack to pirate another member's work.  So really all you have to do to stop the simple cart hacker is do something simple.  Merely making something not work on a standard NES pcb or in an emu would be enough to stop most novice repro makers.<br /><br />If they learned enough to hack it well good for them.  But I think it'd be pretty easy to stop most people based on the repetive questions that come up on how to produce carts that are super simple.  I'd like to think the people in the community here would could figure out would respect the author and not publicly share the hack or  add emu support.  And as far as developing a game with said mapper you could easily create the game with any mapper and then slightly modify it once complete to work on the modified mapper, even if it were some simple register swapping or something.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Thu Jul 05, 2012 8:02 pm</p><hr />
