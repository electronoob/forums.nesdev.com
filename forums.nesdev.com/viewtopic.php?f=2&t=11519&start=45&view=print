		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Regarding the byte that some people have said represents &quot;disk colour&quot;: this isn't necessarily reliable.<br /><br />The first version of Erin's FDS document says in Japanese that $00=Yellow, $01=Blue or gold.  But then a later (much newer) version of the document says that the byte purpose is unknown.<br /><br />Then we have people who come along and say $FE=White, $FF=Blue, $00=Yellow.<br /><br />And now &quot;we have no idea what the value for black disks is&quot;.<br /><br />This is exactly why the byte on the Wiki is labelled &quot;Unknown&quot; with &quot;Speculative&quot; mentions -- there is absolutely nothing definitive so far about it, because there is already conflict in the information: 1) $01 meaning &quot;blue or gold&quot; yet $FF somehow also meaning &quot;blue&quot;, 2) author of original document changing their stance on what the byte represented.<br /><br />What if I told you $00 meant the DiskWriter was manufactured in 1985, $01=1986, $02=1987, $FE=Test/QA unit, $FF=Operating in debug mode?  Or $00=Person formatting the disk preferred Mario over Luigi, $01=Preferred Luigi, $02=Never beat Super Mario Brothers, $FE=I just work here, $FF=Field left empty?  Ponder it for a bit.  :-)<br /><br />Really what's needed is a humongous (I'm talking multiple hundreds, e.g. 500+) set of disks, where a single person (or maybe a pair) dumping them is able to write down details about the disk (ex. colour) vs. that byte.<br /><br />And don't forget about the possibility of incorrect or inverted reads as a result of a faulty sector...<br /><br />P.S. -- Does anyone have code that can be run on the Famicom + FDS that can show an on-screen dump of a sector?  You know, something <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=11520" class="postlink">like this</a>?  I have maybe 15 FDS games (including some originals) which I could provide data for if such is available.  Hmm, actually wait a minute, I'm not sure how I'd even run code on the Famicom with an FDS attached since it takes up the cartridge slot.  Grumble grumble...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you can use FDSLoader, you don't need to write to a Disk at all. Instead you connect the RAM adapter to your PC to load your FDS program into memory. Then you connect the RAM adapter back to the FDS drive and you can begin reading disks with your program to see the bytes of data you want to see on each disk. <br /><br />That would eliminate the need to actually write your program onto a disk, though that's certainly possible too.

I know for instance a couple of games (Super Load Runner, Super Load Runner II) have 40K program blocks as a form of protection.

Depending on the exact wire protocol, anywhere from 88kHz through 192kHz might be sufficient. Some kind of EQ is probably necessary to compensate for the soundcard's lowpass, though.<br /><br />I wonder whether that means we could reasonably rewrite FDSLOADR to use a soundcard now?
