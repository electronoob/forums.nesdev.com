I can't guarantee it's complete, but I think it's at least close. Lots of traces are behind chips. If it's not clear, I guess I could type it up a little more formally, if anyone cares.<br />I suspect the writes to 0x5FF0/1/2/3 are used when the unpopulated chip is in place (not in my copy), as the data being written is the same (but in a different form) as the data being written in the 0x8xxx range from analyzing with a debugger.<br /> <br />Kazzo dumping script&#058;<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/*<br />110 in 1<br /><br />6 et44x (27c040?)<br />ks74hctls273n = 8 bit flip flop<br />gd74ls273 = 8 bit flip flop<br />ar +b9048 pal16l8anc<br />hd74ls139p = 2x 2to4l&nbsp; 00 = o0 low 11 = o3 low<br />*/<br /><br />board &lt;- {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;mappernum = 255,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;cpu_rom = {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;size_base = 16 * mega, size_max = 16 * mega,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;banksize = 0x8000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;},<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ppu_rom= {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;size_base = 8 * mega, size_max = 8 * mega,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;banksize = 0x2000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;},<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ppu_ramfind = false, vram_mirrorfind = true<br />};<br />function cpu_dump(d, pagesize, banksize)<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;for(local i = 0; i &lt; pagesize; i++){<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cpu_write(d, 0x8000 | ((i &lt;&lt; 7) &amp; 0xF80) | ((i &lt;&lt; 9) &amp; 0x4000), 0x00);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cpu_read(d, 0x8000, 0x4000);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cpu_read(d, 0xc000, 0x4000);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br />}<br />function ppu_dump(d, pagesize, banksize)<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;for(local i = 0; i &lt; pagesize; i++){<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cpu_write(d, 0x8000 | (i &amp; 0x3F) | ((i &lt;&lt; 8) &amp; 0x4000), 0x00);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ppu_read(d, 0, banksize);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br />}<br /></div>

If running in Nestopia, Flipull-the first game, for example, is scrambled because it's using the wrong PRG (duplicate copy of Elevator Action?) with the right CHR.  Roughly half of the games will be incorrect because of this.  This would explain why it's marked as a bad dump in FCEUX.<br /><br />The first post was asking for more info, and I thought I'd just share what I found while dumping it in case anyone else wanted to dump theirs.<br />In case the notes/code in Nestopia aren't clear (Nestopia matches my findings):<br />Writes to 0x8000-0xFFFF do the following:<br />The 16 bit address is used.  The data is ignored.<br />CHR is set in a complete block indexed by (Address &amp; 0x3F | Address &gt;&gt; 8 &amp; 0x40)<br />PRG can be a mirrored 0x4000 block, or a complete 0x8000.  I skipped the complex processing when dumping and just did 0x8000 at a time.<br />H/V is set by (Address &amp; 0x2000)<br /><br />Writes in the 0x5FFX occur, but they don't do anything.  I believe they would if the chip that isn't populated on my board was present.<br /><br />Here's some quick copy and pasting in FCEUX that looks like it works (EDIT - Whoops.  Messed up H/V.

With this mod to the mapper code, it returns to the list at the last selected game on Reset, rather than the default one.<br /><br />If you try and select past the last page of games on the actual cart it malfunctions. With the RAM in place with this code in the emulator, it wraps correctly to the beginning of the list.

Otherwise it sets defaults.  (Looks like 0x5000 = Cheats/Hacks/Init values for ROMS, 0x5001 = valid RAM data if =0x2, 0x5002/3 store the position in the game list for reset). So 0xF could just as easily be the power up value. It might be more accurate to just set 0x5001 on power on (and again the value isn't 2, but otherwise could be anything).  I also used 0x5000-0x5FFF as the range, but I only used that because it was only one character to change when copy/pasting the code.  0x5800-0x5FFF also might be correct, or any values the PAL can access from it's address lines that don't conflict with other things (ie can't be &gt;= 0x8000).  Difficult to check either of these without the actual RAM chip in place.

Or maybe just a dark room?<br /><br />As you noticed, only A11-A15 go to the PAL, so the window can't be anything finer.

Or maybe just a dark room?<br /><br />As you noticed, only A11-A15 go to the PAL, so the window can't be anything finer.</div><br />Hmm...<br />I remembered that I actually bought a cheap $60 USB scope a couple years ago and opened it up for the first time today.<br />It looks like I can just barely make out the CLK signal going to the Flip Flops from the PAL (says it's sampling at 2.5 MHz), so I think I ought to be able to see the WE and RE lines going to the 670.<br />Unfortunately, it looks like I can't. It's actually constantly reading half the voltage of the other pins read when they are high (not sure I trust the displayed voltage on this scope).  Maybe this PAL isn't programmed to control those lines because they decided not to with the 670 not in place? Might need to actually have one with the populated RAM to check.  For now, I think I like your theory of 0x580x-5FFx, though, as I'm not sure why they'd need the lower address lines going to the PAL if not for this. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">krzysiobal wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Very good:<br /><br />Can I ask for ROM so that I can test it on my fpga cartridge?<br /><br />BTW.  168-in-1 multicart does not have any external register, but it still remembers the position of last chosen game after resetting console.<br /><br />Never mind, I found that I have this ROM with date of 2011-11-04 so probably it's not so new (and PRG &amp; CHR CRC matches the one you said).<br /></div><br />If your PRG and CHR match my CRCs than I'm sure you've got the same thing as me.  As MLX mentioned earlier, it looks like it was successfully dumped before.  I was just basing my knowledge on google searches that said no known good dumps existed, and the one I found to compare with my dump was indeed bad. It looks like someone else did have a good dump, and it's nice to have confirmation that my dump matches someone else's.<br /><br />As for the resetting, I can think of two ways of keeping the game list position on reset:<br />1. If they can free up a byte somewhere in all the games you can store it internally. (Maybe reducing the stack size of the games by 1?)<br />2. If the reset vector for each game writes its own menu values to internal RAM before switching to the bank where the MENU is, that should work.<br /><br />In any case, this game's menu code was clearly designed with the RAM in place, and not changed when it was removed. Otherwise, the list wrapping wouldn't have required it to work properly. Also, the Cheat/Hacks/Trainers value might have worked as well.<br />Note that because the RAM is missing, on the actual cart, the menu selections that are supposed to affect gameplay don't work properly.  For example, all versions of The New Human/Super Man #(Dino Riki, I think?) have him shooting clones of himself.  On the emulator with RAM enabled, the projectiles are different (fireballs, boomerangs, clones) when different versions are selected.  Title screen color similarly is different with RAM, and the same on the actual cart (my copy without the RAM).

If you're seeing a weirdly middling voltage, and not the same as what's going into the two 74'273's latches, then ... I guess it could have configured the pin as an input instead?<br /><br />My first thought was that it was getting into a fight with something else, but with what could it possibly do so? Those pins don't appear to be connected to anything else.

I promptly went to test it on emulators and the page changing on the games list bugs on the last page and the second to last page. Try moving the cursor from below and from above. Different bugs but neither works. Also, can't start games from #105-#110. Using nestopia 1.40.
