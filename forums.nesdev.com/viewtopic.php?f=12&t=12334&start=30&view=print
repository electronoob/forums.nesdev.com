		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since you have windows 10, I would recommend that you install the Windows subsystem for linux (WSL) and to compile it in that environment.  Most of the command lines tools are often more easy to compile in a *nix environment and WSL does improve your chances of compiling it properly compared to other tools that in the past. I think I compiled it once but I did a reset of WSL so I may try it again and see if there is any specific step to do if you get stuck and don't know how to do it.<br /><br />The best is to just git clone from WSL and build from there. You may need to install a few tools that it depends on (like cmake) before being able to built it properly.

Thanks for any more help.<br /><br />edit: I got this working for Unix/Linux, I just compiled in the Linux environment following the first step of the instructions, and I'll just code in Linux to avoid having to back date my Windows OS. The resulting &quot;Files&quot; after making the binaries operate within Terminal. I.e. ./wla-65816<br />This was confusing for me because I was expecting the resulting binaries to have executable programs in them, as you'd see from the pre-compiles.  <br /><br />To anyone else that has issues with their Cmake compile(These are the tools Banshaku spoke of aside from Cmake): <br />sudo apt-get install g++<br />sudo apt-get install gcc<br />sudo apt install make<br />Delete the CMakeCache.txt<br />Re-attempt<br /><br />Would be cool if someone could drop a line on their successes with Windows OS. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I cloned wla via gitkraken, run &quot;cmake .&quot; in the repo's root from a cmd prompt, and that'll generate a sln and proj files from which I can build and run as-is. I forget what all dependencies I had to get installed first - wla-dx is not the first cmake-generated tool I've been working with on my system - but I think it should just be cmake and maybe mingw. At most, I've had cmake complain that it's trying to generate files for NMake, which means that it's not finding my VS2017 installation for some reason. I'm not sure what the steps are for discovering that, but I think it was some problem with my env-vars.<br /><br />There are a handful of other tools that still like Linux environments as mentioned above - e.g. I've been working in bsnes and there's only a makefile for that that targets gcc/g++ specifically, so VS and VSCode have to debug it via a layer over gdb - but mingw seems to be sufficing for my uses so far.
