For a non-english person the etymology* might not be obvious, but it's the best we have, i think. Unlike <strong>keyframe</strong>, it describes any one picture in a sequence/ of pictures, not just the ones holding special meta information (in digital animation) or representing original frames distinguished from interpolated (in hand drawn/film development-mixed animation). <br /><br />*celluloid painting for use in animation against a fixed or scrolling background in classic animation.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">row</div><br />I think i have a reservation, and some additions.<br />&quot;A cycle of the smallest significant rhythmic time base in a piece of music&quot; &lt;-- is this how time base should be used? Wouldn't that make one row a full note? Or wait, i'm confusing time base with measure, am i not?<br /><br />The term 'row' seems drawn from rows and columns in text mode graphics, where a row is <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">abs&#40;yposinpixels/tileheight&#41;</tt>.<br />When speaking of a row in a tracker, i think it, just like &quot;order table element&quot; is a fixed measure, as it would be in an old school text editor (compare with 'lines' when speaking of code). Except rows wrap around at the pattern length boundary. <br /><br />A usable phrase could be: &quot;on tri channel, what if you moved all notes in pattern 00, 01 and 03 on row 1C to row 1E?&quot;<br />Of course, this doesn't exclude it being used as a relative measure: &quot;I think C#4 would be stronger two rows off in either direction.&quot;<br /><br />When speaking of Rows and Cols in nes graphics, the above formula works. Speaking of at which row or column a line of text should appear could be practical, for example. Or when dealing with scrolling issues or attributes. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Tile: An 8x8 or 8x16 pixel image</div><br />An 8x16 pixel image is two tiles, isn't it?

Ah well, let's say we've got 4 cels in a cycle running over 16 frames. <br />Each cel updates what ppu patterns are used. In between them, there's also position-domain animation. Metasprite goes up, then right, then down, then left one pixel. So there's two animation domains across the time domain. We could theoretically add more, like subpalette animation, even character masking...<br /><br />Keys here could hold info on what to set timers and temps(or what arrays to look into) for the next alteration in the corresponding animation domain. Each time a timer reaches 0, the &quot;step sequencer&quot; advances one step in the appropriate domain, in a way described by arrays or maybe even some temp vars.<br /><br />So the distinction is between the key that governs the total sum of animation on one hand, and the various components of animation on the other: picture, position, mask, priority, subpalette assignment, subpalette colours, what have you.

Famitracker follows the (slightly loose) standard of every pattern sequencer i've ever used in this regard; be it yamaha, alesis, korg or some eurorack boutique module, and pattern sequencers are the standard (in what sense there is a standard) which some other trackers seem to have chosen (actively or by pathtaking chance) to deviate from.<br /><br />Most often, they do call the totality of pattern sequences a song. (Edit: Actually; as does famitracker too.) <br /><br />The small differences between pattern sequencers is often in the ui/gui (and mostly it's then about navigation, confirmation and stuff like that), but not really in the underlying structure.

A tempo of 496 rows per minute implies 60.1*60/496 = close to 7.25 ticks per row. If you alternate among 8, 7, 7, and 7 ticks per sixteenth note, it averages out to 7.25 ticks per sixteenth note, or 124.3 quarter notes per minute.<br /><br />Or you might set a grid of swung eighth notes by alternating between 12 and 8 or 13 and 7 ticks. This averages out to 20 ticks per quarter note or 180 quarter notes per minute, but the on-beat eighth note is longer than the off-beat one, creating a swing feel.<br /><br />For more information on grooves in 0CC-FamiTracker, see <a href="https://github.com/HertzDevil/0CC-FamiTracker/blob/master/0CC-readme.txt" class="postlink">0CC-readme.txt</a>.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">nitro2k01 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Video field: A cycle of a 60.1 Hz or 50.0 Hz time base</div><br />Surely you mean 59.94?</div><br />Video following the NTSC standard has a field rate of 60000/1001 = about 59.94 Hz.<br />The NES PPU and Super NES S-PPU produce nonstandard video with a field rate of 39375000/655171 = about 60.10 Hz.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">nitro2k01 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do you know of examples where a music engine is synced to CD sectors.

By contrast, NT2, FT, and Pently have single-channel patterns because on the smaller memory of an 8-bit machine, it becomes more important to reuse e.g. bass and drum patterns across different melody patterns. The order table in NT2 and FT is coarse, aligning pattern starts along all channels; Pently's is finer, allowing a pattern to restart on any row. I haven't used LSDJ so I'm not familiar with its architecture.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">nitro2k01 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Shouldn't that be &quot;usually&quot;?

But I was defining these relative to the NES so as not to confuse readers with excessive generality. That's also why I used 60.1 Hz.

In a context like that, it would probably be natural to call changes on the sprite timeline keyframes.<br /><br />The timelines could be position, colour, velocity, gravity, blend mode, etc. whatever's useful. I've used/worked on animation editors like this. For the &quot;sprite&quot; timeline maybe the only available interpolator is just a hold (or perversely you might call it a &quot;nearest neighbour&quot; interpolation).<br /><br />So I think in a context like that to provide analogy I probably would call it a keyframe. Looking at just the sprites changing over time, I wouldn't have, though.<br /><br /><br />On another note, I usually feel like &quot;metasprite&quot; is an awkward and unnecessary distinction from &quot;sprite&quot;. I get that it's trying to differentiate a hardware sprite (single tile) from the overall thing, but it seems to invert what's important to me. The word &quot;sprite&quot; should just be the one you talk about most (the metasprite), and the hardware sprite is the more specific technical thing that should be made awkward with more attached words. So in most cases I'd say &quot;sprite tile&quot; for the hardware sprite where it should be disambiguated, and just &quot;sprite&quot; instead of metasprite.<br /><br />...tons of people here seem to love typing &quot;metasprite&quot; out over and over, so maybe I'm a weirdo in this preference.<br /><br /><br /><em>edit: additional note moved to post below, tokumaru intervened</em>
