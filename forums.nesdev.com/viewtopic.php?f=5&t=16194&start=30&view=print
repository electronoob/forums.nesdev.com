But there's something odd in our culture which makes people just sort of throw up their arms and go: &quot;Might as well be chinese to me!&quot; Likely do to the unfamiliarity of the symbols used. Those who are able to get a little bit further might still throw up their arms later when they encounter something which appears to be the definition of an impossibility: i, the square root of -1. But I'm trying to say that ....if we taught math more carefully and properly, we could mitigate the cognitive dissonance by explaining exactly what math and abstractions actually are. Instead we just ask students to take the definitions and abstractions as they were originally formulated a hundred, two hundred or more years ago so they seem archaic and no effort is put into explaining them in simpler terms.<br /><br />It seems as though some folks are blessed with the ability to intuit abstractions right away. They just &quot;get&quot; that they are abstractions without ever consciously verbalizing this fact. Then there are folks for whom for whatever reason abstract thinking is a bit more of a challenge---it was for me. I think I'm just now reaching some kind of threshold in my mental development which is making it easier to grasp and accept abstractions as they are. My point is I feel if mathematics were taught more carefully, more people might be able to develop that ability more quickly rather than it just being a &quot;you're born with it or you're not&quot; kind of deal.

If you're counting potatoes, then you're right. But when counting meters above sea level for example, negative numbers are a very real thing that happens in real life. A wider situation is locating a point on an infinite straight line; you will have to resort to negative values because the line does not end or start anywhere, so you cannot set the zero adequately to use only positive numbers, no matter how you try.<br /><br />Temperature is often used as an example but it's a horrible example because actually 0K is a true zero and there's no reason to have negative temperatures at all, except we didn't know about absolute zero back when the concept of &quot;temperature&quot; was invented.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's difficult to communicate what I'm really trying to say, here. What I'm saying is that the concept of &quot;negative&quot; is an operation that we essentially define to mean &quot;reverse direction&quot; on the number line, and it helps solve problems algebraically. We can't count a negative number of something unless we're talking about taking something away, which is an *action* not a thing in the real world. It's abstract to begin with is what I'm saying. It's real, of course, but not real the way a physical object is real. This is the only point I'm trying to make.<br /><br />Defining i as the square root of -1 seems like we're defining a falsehood. But if you think about it like I'm trying to suggest, it's simply another abstraction which enables yet more algebraic solutions to work. The normal way we apply &quot;negative&quot; to multiplying negative numbers makes the square root of -1 seem like a falsehood, but since &quot;negative&quot; was a rule or action to begin with, what we're really saying is: &quot;IF -1 had a square root and followed this rule, let's call it i.&quot; And the fascinating thing is that it lets us solve more problems.<br /><br />For some reason it's a lot easier to understand and internalize &quot;negative&quot; than to accept an abstraction where we must suppose a falsehood is true (i is the square root of -1). Get where I'm going with this? They're both very &quot;real&quot; in that they solve real problems, but one is a hell of a lot harder to grasp if you aren't blessed with an innate ability to grasp definitions and abstractions. It seems to me with enough effort math pedagogy could be improved so that concepts such as complex numbers would not be so intimidating.

Haha</div><br />I would say no about quaternions; the primary use for them in 3D graphics is simply as a way to express a rotation and its axis in a compact/efficient way. You don't <em>really</em> need to understand the &quot;complex&quot; consequences of that to work with them for that purpose, which is merely a geometric purpose. (Just as I said above, how I think using complex numbers for 2D geometry problems is probably unnecessarily confusing.)<br /><br />So... while the <em>word</em> quarternion will come up almost certainly, its actual use is really to just represent a 3D geometric rotation and it need not be understood any more than that to work with quaternions in 3D graphics. (There <em>are</em> 3D graphics applications of the true complex quaternion, but they're obscure.)<br /><br />However, if you want to write a raytracer, for example, you'll probably very quickly run into cases that require complex numbers to solve effectively. An intersection of a ray and a sphere is a quadratic equation, but a ray and a torus is a quartic. I mentioned how they have some hideous &quot;<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/QuarticEquation.html" class="postlink">formula</a>&quot; solutions for such a thing but in practice they do not tend to be numerically stable (the floating point errors compound wildly). You're going to have a very hard time writing a practical solver for this kind of thing without dealing in complex numbers.
