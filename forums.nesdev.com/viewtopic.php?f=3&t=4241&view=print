<br />When I tried to enter in the doubled gain values into Nestopia's settings, B-Y's doubled gain of 2.032 was clipped to 2, which seems to be Nestopia's color decoder limit for angle gains.  The luminance ranges across the different hues became oversaturated and disproportionate of each other after doubling the gains, which might also be why Nestopia halves the gains.

On modern websites, I've read 7100K or even 9300K, like Japanese TVs.</div>Most Japanese and American TVs of the 1980s use a white point of 9300K+27MPCD, meaning the same. The most common decoding characteristics seem to be something like 120°/246°/-10° with gains of 0.75/0.33/1.00 (roughly). (This will look too "red" on an sRGB monitor.)
<br />With gains that high, most TVs will use a "relative colorimetric" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_intent#Rendering_intent" class="postlink">rendering intent</a>, whereas Nestopia's decoder seems to use a "saturation" rendering intent.

<br />Compare the RGB NES palette with the yellow boosted palette, and you will find they are VERY similar. this is evidence that the RGB NES PPUs were designed to replicate that amount of yellow boost.
<br />
<br />MANY japanese developed games look right with that yellow boost, and look wrong with any other setting.

<br />Maybe some of the yellow boosted hues (5-A) may look similar in hue, but the luminances look <em>very</em> warped in the RGB palette in comparison to a yellow boosted NTSC palette in Nestopia, especially hues 3 and 4.  So I don't think the RGB palette is a good standard here.
<br />
<br />Also, as mentioned in this thread, I found a bug in Nestopia's yellow boost that differentiate colors 0x20 and 0x30 in red, green, and yellow emphasis settings.  Someone else <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=2148125&amp;group_id=83320&amp;atid=569064" class="postlink">reported this</a> in Nestopia's bug tracker, concluding that Nestopia was calculating yellow boost based on the NES's palette values and not on the PPU's output values.  Yellow boost is supposed to be directly a TV effect, not a Famicom PPU effect; if you play with the hue slider, you'll see that colors the TV should yellow boost are not boosted anymore.  So Nestopia's yellow boost is probably not reliable regardless.

<br />Given that no one has ever named a television model that actually works this way, I still think the yellow boost business is a dud. I once mentioned the idea based on a single untrustworthy source and had it as experimental code in my algorithm when blargg created his library, and that's why it's still there after all that time, unfortunately.

<br />I removed "hue warping" from nes_ntsc in version 0.2.1 in 2006. I thought Nestopia always had its own extended color algorithms, which this yellow boost came from.

<br />Maybe _Zaphod_, if he has one of these JP consumer TVs, could tell us the model of that TV to see for sure if JP TVs indeed boost yellow or not.

Yeah, I could see how oversaturation could produce an illusion of this yellow boost...could it be that Japanese TVs are simply set to be more saturated than American TVs?  I personally think that might be the case, because yellow does "boost" if you increase saturation in Nestopia.  Naturally, since the yellowish hues are generally the most saturated hues in the NES, a saturation increase would be noticable on the brighter colors of yellowish hues, which are 7 and 8 in the NES under normal emphasis settings.

This over-saturating the picture only works however if your TV sets doesn't clip colors. Here's an example of what I mean:
<br /><img src="http://www.lau-net.de/~nl2305/ZeldaBoost.png" alt="Image" />
<br />left: saturation at 100% (default). Accurate hues, but pale color 0x37.
<br />middle: saturation at 200% with simple RGB clipping, as used in cheap TVs. Yellow "boosted" color 0x37, but the browns drift to red because of the RGB clipping.
<br />right: saturation at 200% with hue preservation, as used in better TVs; boosted yellows while still accurate browns.
