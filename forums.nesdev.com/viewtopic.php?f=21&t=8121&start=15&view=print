<br />Thanks!
<br />That's something else I was going to ask about.  What rules am I breaking in that image so I can fix them in the game?  Some bits like the enemies here I had in mind two layers of sprites to get an extra couple colors if it was a real NES game.

I don't mind taking the sky out if that helps (or at least removing the clouds so that the sky is more block colored and working more in 16x16).  Then if I remove the dark blue secondary light on the right side of the brown trees changing it to dark brown that'll eliminate that color which I can perhaps switch that color index to the sky color so that the 'gothrough branch platforms of the the tree can use the sky color as part of their 16x16 palette?  Am I on the right lines here?<br /><br />The grass in front of the darker tree tiles can stay though can't it as it uses the same dark blue/green and black the trees do.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The sprites have way too many colors, but like you said, they can be layered for extra colors, but even if that's the case I'm seeing more than 4 unique 3-color palettes.

<br />
<br />Oh that's ok. I don't mean to have too many sprites in a row.  They're just like that here for show.  They'll be more scattered in-game and I'm just pixelling a couple more smaller enemies right now that use only one layer and can be used a bit more often.    The leaves on the branches would be sprites that fall when walked over (though I might just take them out completely), the flowers overlaid on the grass would be sprites that could be destroyed as the dragon's fireball or flame (think Dhalsim from Street Fighter, hehe) passes through them but again I won't have many per row especially in areas where enemies would walk along there.
<br />
<br />The smaller palettes thing is something I'm not quite sure about.  How's that work?
<br />
<br />Anyways this be the kind of advice I've been looking for, thanks <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />I assume the little dragons are your player characters. If you have two palettes for player characters, you're going to have to make a lot of other stuff on the screen use the same palette as the player characters, such as using the red dragon's palette for the flames. If you freeze-frame Contra, for example, take a look at how many moving objects share the same palette as player 1 or player 2.
<br />
<br />You may have to dynamically allocate the third and fourth palettes, much as the first Super Mario Bros. does, and restrict enemies with incompatible palettes from entering the same area. Notice, for example, the lack of Red Koopas and Green Koopas anywhere near each other, and the fact that Lakitu and Spiny usually get a level (e.g. 4-1) or big part of a level (e.g. first few screens of 8-2) to themselves.
<br />
<br />Try mocking up an actual screenshot with only those things that'll be in a single area at once, and I'll point out where your coloring errors are.

<br />NES tiles have 4 colors, and since sprites need transparency one of the colors is always transparent, which leaves you with only 3 colors per sprite palette. Your mockup appears to be using more than 4 palettes. Each dragon uses 1 palette, the coins need another one, what you have left is simply not enough to represent the ghosts, diamonds, chests, barrels, candles and flames.

<br />I thought SMB uses these palettes:

<br />sprites
<br />
<br />palette 1: Mario or Luigi
<br />palette 2: goomba, bullet bill, buzzy beatle, hammers
<br />palette 3: red koopa, powerup mushroom, spiney, fireballs
<br />palette 4: green koopa, 1up mushroom, pirhana plant, lakitu, bowser, hammer bros
<br />
<br />background
<br />
<br />palette 1: ground, brick blocks
<br />palette 2: ? blocks, coins (animated palette)
<br />palette 3: grass, trees, mountains
<br />palette 4: clouds

<br />The NES has 4 background palettes and 4 sprite palettes. Sprites can't use background palettes and backgrounds can't use sprite palettes.
<br />
<br />You seem to have defined black as the background color, so all 4 background palettes will have black as their first color. The remaining 3 colors of each palette can be anything you want.
<br />
<br />The first color of every sprite is always transparent, the remaining 3 can be anything you want. If you want to use black on the sprites, one of the 3 colors of the palette must be set to black.
<br />
<br />Except for the attribute clashes, your use of the background palettes looks OK, it's the sprites I'm worried about. Each dragon needs one palette, and the coins also need one. That only leaves you with 1 palette to work with for everything else.
<br />
<br />If I were you I would redraw the red dragon and all the fire to use the same palette. Coins and barrels could probably share a palette too. The last palette could be cyan-ish and used for the ghosts and chests. The clothes of the floating enemies could use the palettes of the dragons or the coins (although they have no black). Flowers and diamonds will have to use the existing palettes, which should have enough variety of colors. The falling leaves could use the green dragon's palette. I'd do something like this:
<br />
<br />palette 0: green dragon, green egg, leaves;
<br />palette 1: red dragon, flames, red diamonds, flowers;
<br />palette 2: coins, barrels, candles, flowers;
<br />palette 3: ghosts/enemies, gray diamonds, chests, spikes;
<br />
<br />Although the spikes would probably work better as background, unless they are supposed to move.

<br />This is not such a big deal... The background is almost correct, and the sprites are probably easy to change (even if they'll look slightly less colorful). Personally I'd love to see something like this running on a real NES.
