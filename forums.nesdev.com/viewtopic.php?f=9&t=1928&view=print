		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Have a CopyNES but want to add a cool (but mostly redundant) LCD screen?  These quick instructions show how to.  If you were able to assemble your CopyNES you should have no problems installing the screen.
<br />
<br />Warning:  some of the pins for the LCD may be used for Memblers ufrom cart, I dont know how that will be handled.  Bios v3 still has LCD output so it may not interfere.
<br />
<br />Parts needed:
<br />16x1 character LCD screen - 16x2 will work but the letters could be in the wrong places (see below)  <a href="http://www.allelectronics.com/" class="postlink">www.allelectronics.com</a> is a good source for cheap used screens.
<br />1x 0.1uF capacitor
<br />
<br />Step 1:  Add cap, headers
<br />First solder a 0.1uF capacitor (same as the others) into the C7 spot on the CopyNES board.  Then solder pin headers to the 14 holes at CN2.  The headers can be on the top or bottom of the board.
<br /><img src="http://www.nesmuseum.com/copyneslcd/copynesboard.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Step 2:  Make the board cable
<br />Next make the cable that goes from the board to the LCD.  A hard disk connector and ribbon cable works great for connecting to the board.  Just cut off the extra so it is 7x2 holes.  If you are mounting the LCD on the front of the NES you will need at least 13" of cable.  
<br /><img src="http://www.nesmuseum.com/copyneslcd/connector.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Step 3: Make the LCD cable
<br />The other end can either be soldered directly to the LCD or made with another hard disk connector cut to 14x1 holes.  At least the #1 pin on the LCD should be labelled.  The others will be sequential along the row.  Connect the pins labelled in red to the same number on the LCD.  If your LCD has a backlight there should be at least 2 separate pins for power, you will have to find a datasheet for those.
<br /><img src="http://www.nesmuseum.com/copyneslcd/lcdpins.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Step 4:  Test the LCD
<br />Test everything before mounting!  You should get some messages when playing a cart and other CopyNES functions.
<br /><img src="http://www.nesmuseum.com/copyneslcd/waiting.png" alt="Image" />
<br /><img src="http://www.nesmuseum.com/copyneslcd/playing.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Step 4:  Mount the LCD
<br />I mounted my LCD on the front, another cool place would be the cart door.  I cut a hole in the front, and cut off the screw mounting post.  Some quick hot glue holds it in place for now.  
<br /><img src="http://www.nesmuseum.com/copyneslcd/lcd.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Step 5:  Route the cable
<br />If you are mounting the LCD on the front, do not route the cable under the board.  Instead go around the outside to avoid the cart mechanism.

<br />
<br />Step 6:  All Done!
<br />Next step, build internal four score as seen on right side  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Nice job on the LCD.  I've considered adding one for a project I have in mind as well.  I'm just afraid I'd make a mess out of the NES case though since I don't have a quality dremel.  I guess that's what I get for buying something called RotoMatic.
<br />
<br />The thing that stood out to me though in your pics, and what made me do a double-take, is the fact that you have four controller ports!  While this might be a normal mod around these parts, I haven't seen such a thing before.  I would assume it's using the same extra shift registers deal as the Four Score, though I can't see what it's connected to to know exactly what you've done.

<br />
<br />The internal 4-score looks really cool!

<br />Unless you're trying to troubleshoot communication between the NES and the PC.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The internal fourscore is mounted on the right side so the turbo and 2/4 switch are accessible.  I pulled the controller sockets off the fourscore board and used them for the top ports.  A big mess of wires connects the original ports to the fourscore, and the fourscore to the nes mobo.  Sometime I will add a hinge to the top of the nes case so it opens well.  I never have any screws there because I take it apart so often.
