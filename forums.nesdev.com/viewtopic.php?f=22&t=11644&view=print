I was wondering if anyone could create a custom game using custom drawn characters that I would provide.<br /><br />I would like it to be at least one world or enough to play through...not sure on the semantics. I also understand that being a specific custom game for one person would cost more, which I would like to discuss at the start but am willing to pay.<br /><br />Not sure what other information is need, but could/would you or anyone you know be able to create something like this?<br /><br />Fingers Crossed,<br /><br /><img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Savvy<br /><br />I also posted this in general-just wanted to cover all my bases.

I doubt that you will find anyone wanting to do this project for you for free as that is a LOT of time invested into making such a game. Plus, what would they get out of it. <br /><br />You would need to pay a hefty chunk of change for something like even one world.<br /><br />Think of it as a business deal, would you really expect anyone to just give you something such as a brand new Xbox One game from Best Buy? <br /><br />If you want it so bad, why not just <span style="text-decoration: underline">LEARN</span> ASM and do it yourself? This option has twofold benefits:<br />1) It saves you money.<br />2) It saves other people time.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Savvy wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I also posted this in general-just wanted to cover all my bases.</div><br />You posted the same thread twice? (<a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=11642" class="postlink">http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=11642</a>) That's considered spamming and could get you banned or a warning. If you were unsure, you should have asked the mods where this should have went.<br /><br />EDIT: For example, a hack like my SMB1/SMB2J with SRAM, glitch fixes (I fixed every glitch known to man), code optimization etc. would cost roughly $950 USD for someone wanting my ASM skills. And that's for a hack alone. (I did it for free because it's something I wanted to do for <em>me</em>.)
