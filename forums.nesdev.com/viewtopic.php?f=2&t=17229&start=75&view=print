For example, in a &quot;normal&quot; loop you'd spend half the time doing increment/decrement and compare, and half the time actually transfering data, 50%/50%, this is the worst case. A partially unrolled loop can get you arround 20%/80%, while a fully unrolled loop would get you to 0%/100% ; the closer you get to fully unrolled, the more ROM you waste for a very marginal time gain.

Not all kinds of unrolled loops need &quot;ridiculous amounts of ROM&quot; though: 128 bytes (PLA + STA $2007 32 times) is hardly a ridiculous amount of space. I usually put my vblank handlers in a separate PRG bank anyway, so I have plenty of room for unrolled code that'll allow me to make the most out of the limited vblank time.

I was just pointing out that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys. <br /><br />Sorry to resurrect my own thread. I'm doing the black bars at the top and bottom. <br /><br />Jurassic park does it by bank switching. One thing i overlooked is that they assume that every palette has a black color at the same location. I think this is a big constrain on colors, so I would like to avoid that. But id still like the bars to be black (having them the BG color is easy).<br /><br />For the bottom one, its kind of easy. Receive and IRQ, wait until hblank, disable PPU and do a palette swap real quick and the bottom of the screen goes black. Done. If timed correctly its 100% clean.<br /><br />The top is really hard. Almost impossible. Palette swaps are possible, but it messes the scrolling. It can be fixed, but it requires that weird 2006/2005/2005/2006 trick described in that skinny doc. But by the time you swapped the palette and fixed the scrolling, 1-2 lines of garbage will have time to draw. Am I missing something here?<br /><br />The other way that was mentioned is with a sprite overflow. But i'm not sure it solves anything. Will I still have to do a palette swap in that case too i guess.<br /><br />Is there a 3rd option I am missing?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />-Mat

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What you're trying to do is way more complicated than what Jurassic Park does. Messing with the palette mid-screen is not for the faint of heart. Disabling/enabling rendering mid-screen can also corrupt sprites in certain cases.<br /><br />If you're dead set on doing this the harder way just so you can have black borders, I suggest you figure out how &quot;that weird 2006/2005/2005/2006 trick&quot; actually works, otherwise you'll end up in a world of frustration.<br /><br />Another tip that may help you out, is that when rendering is off and the PPU address register (the one you set via $2006) is pointing to the palette area, the color at that address gets displayed instead of the background color. Combine that with the fact that even though they're never displayed during rendering, color 0 of the last 3 background palettes ($3F04, $3F08 and $3F0C) still exist in memory, so you can have one of them set as black and simply point at it when rendering is off, eliminating the need to change the background color. For the top border, you still have to set the scroll, of course, since the address register will be pointing at the black palette entry. And you'll need to time the top border using something other than MMC3 IRQs if rendering is off.<br /><br />A sprite overflow would only mask sprites, you'd still have to do something about the background.<br /><br />Are you sure that the background color isn't good enough for the border? If you settle for that you can just do what JP does and use blank (i.e. color 0) tiles for the border.<br /><br />You could also use the grayscale and/or color emphasis bits to make the border look different from the background color without much trouble, since those don't affect the scroll.

That's why the full 240 scanlines (well, actually 239 in the PAL PPU) are displayed despite most TVs hiding some of the scanlines.
