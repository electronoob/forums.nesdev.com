I miss the good old time when nobody knew this site existed.</div><br />In my opinion, links to Wikipedia serve as 1. a uniform resource identifier (URI) for a subject, distinguishing it from similarly named subjects, and 2. a starting point for familiarizing oneself with a subject. What resource would you prefer to serve these purposes? Or would you prefer that people copy a Wikipedia article's entire lead section (for purpose 1) and &quot;References&quot; section (for purpose 2) into a post?

Many articles on Wikipedia I've seen are exact copies of what are on other websites, just rearranged. I know people are worried about other people going through Wikipedia articles and changing random things just to be a jerk, but people don't usually target articles about the SuperFX or something else that. Like I said, a lot of the time, the article is a word for word copy.<br /><br />Here's a fun little game: see if you can find the error in the Wikipedia page about Contra III. (I've only found 1, but there a probably more.) <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_III:_The_Alien_Wars">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_III:_The_Alien_Wars</a><!-- m -->

In my experience, like 99% of the material you can find out there will have at least some sort of error or problem, and a sizable amount of that will be just completely wrong or even purposefully misleading. And when you <em>do</em> find the 1% that is correct, it turns out that it either proves you wrong or at the very least doesn't prove your point anyway, so you end up discarding it in favor of something that's more biased towards the point you want to make...<br /><br />So yeah =/

That's a completely different issue that has nothing to do with credibility.<br /><br /><br />Honestly, I find it really irritating for people to point out an error and then just keep it to themself. It's arrogant. Click that edit button and make it better.

It's one of people with overly systemizing minds who camp articles and find policy excuses to revert what doesn't meet their agenda. They wanted me to keep the lockdown inherent in iOS and game consoles out of the &quot;Crippleware&quot; article (which at the time had the more economics-jargon term &quot;Damaged good&quot;) because they were unsatisfied with the reliability of the sources.
