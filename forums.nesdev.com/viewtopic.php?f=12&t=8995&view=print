Post clear picture of pcb, where you go it, the circumstance in which you acquired it, what happen when you actually put it in a snes or why you can't try it. You know, anything really. Otherwise the best educated guess I can give you with the little info you gave is that it might be the 32th beta of Battletoad lol <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

<br />
<br />Another one says "Clay 2", which is almost certainly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C2_Judgement_Clay" class="postlink">ClayFighters 2: Judgement Clay</a>, which was another commercial title from Interplay.
<br />
<br />The final cart only contains a partial ROM set; the main game is missing.
<br />
<br />The handwriting, as well as the labels, on the other chips is mostly compliant with what Nintendo requires when submitting the EPROMs to Nintendo for review.  That process, and what gets written on each EPROM label, is documented.  I can provide that document if needed; the SNES Devkit PDFs you can find on romhacking.net don't contain the sheets; I have them however.  :-)
<br />
<br />EDIT: Okay, re-examining all the photos, it does look like it says BT32V.  It's completely unknown what that means.  It could be some internal code set that's used throughout most of their games (common routines) or common graphics.  One of them has "Lo1" written on it, which obviously means LoROM, and is probably ROM #1.  It wouldn't surprise me if BT32V meant something like "Been Tested, 32 {something}, Verified" or who knows what else.
<br />
<br />If you thought any developer actually wrote coherent stuff in that field before submitting it to Nintendo, you thought wrong.  Usually programmers desks were strewn with EPROMs and they simply wrote whatever on them.  "Hey Dave, do you have that EPROM for Snake Wrangler Ball Busters 8 from last week?  The one where there was that glitch when pressing XYAB simultaneously?"  "Oh, yeah, uh, it's the one over there with a penis scribbled on it".
<br />
<br />The EPROMs themselves appear to be 4mbit (512KBytes) in size, which makes perfect sense since a couple of the boards state "4M/8M" on them (4mbit / 8mbit, e.g. 512KBytes / 1024KBytes).  The ones without labels say 27C4001, which are 4mbit chips.
<br />
<br />I have no idea what the DIP switch on the one board does, but probably controls MODE 20 vs. 21 addressing maps, etc..  One of the boards without a DIP switch has "20MAP" silkscreened at the bottom (labelled CL3) with a solder pad, for example.  DIP switches made this ordeal a lot easier on the developers and was more economical for Nintendo.  The same board also has pads called CL1 and CL2, which let you select something with a value of 16, 64, or 256.  Maybe they're for larger EPROMs which don't use x8 and instead something larger?  Someone would have to reverse engineer the board.
<br />
<br />The PCBs are all SNES developer boards that Nintendo used to send authorised companies when they signed up for their dev programme.
<br />
<br />I really don't think any of that stuff is worth US$300.  As usual, eBay people making bank off of stuff that really isn't worth it.

<br />
<br />Here are the ones working now 
<br />
<br />Lost Vikings 2
<br />boogerman
<br />clay fighter
<br />Bubsy 2 pre release version
<br />Steven Seagal the las option (UNRELEASED)
<br />
<br />and in still working on BT32V which I believe is Black Throne also made by intelplay.
<br />
<br />By the way these carts are not mine.
<br />
<br />I wanted to bet on the auction but i was to late. but because the world we live in is so small. the buyer happened to live by my house.
<br />
<br />and he actually contacted me because I was selling some repros on cragslist and asked me if i could help.
<br />
<br />
<br />He got Clay,vikings,bubsy, and boogerman working and I gor Steven Seagal working and I fixed BT32V because It had a pin broken. 
<br />
<br />Im meeting with him today, he is going to give me another cart to test the BT32V eproms.
<br />
<br />Ill update
