<br />
<br />For my first try, I took a FF3J (TNROM) since there is only one chip to remove. So I removed the chip. I didn't cut the traces, just bended the pins.  Rerouted the proper pins for a flash epprom (AT29C040A).
<br />
<br />(updated diagram again) Here's the chip diagrams side by side:

<br />- Took pin 1 (A18) and connected it to hole 2
<br />- Took pin 2 (A16) and connected it to hole 24
<br />- Took pin 30(A17) and connected it to hole 1
<br />- Took Pin 31 (WE) and 24 (OE), connected them together then connected it to pin 16 (GND)
<br />
<br />I tested all the pins and none of them touch each other.
<br />
<br />To test the results, I decided to use the same rom as the original game to make sure the board works. I took a rom and stripped the ines header, flash it.  For now I only have a grey screen.
<br />
<br />The possible error I see are:
<br />- The content of the flash eprom is wrong
<br />- I made a mistake in the wiring
<br />- Since I inserted by mistake the board backward (... It was 2h in the morning), I may have fried the board
<br />- Connecting WE to OE then to GND was not a good idea
<br />
<br />I will try to continue to debug it tonight.  Any comments about possible mistakes I made are appreciated.
<br />
<br />Here's a few pictures I took very fast this morning showing the board. Sorry, they are a little bit blurry.

<br />Oh my this is a possibility. It's surprising you were able to do that. But probably that did nothing really bad, as long as you don't apply -5V on chips, they really DON'T like this at all.

This mean since hole 31 is +5 like VCC (hole 32), I didn't have to do anything. <br /><br />Regarding the chip, this could be the second mistake.  The burner I bought is quite simple (a little bit too much) to the point that the instruction manual is only 3 pages and they don't really explain anything except the obvious think like "this is the load button" (...).  I write the program on it, read the chip after and the result is all FF.  I will have to fix this before I can test it more properly.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Oh my this is a possibility.

<br />
<br />I always remembered that on US nes cartridges that the chips are on the front of the cart.  In the case of famicom... This is the opposite.  Since the famicom is a top loader,  when you put a socket, this really reduce the space left between the cart and the slot.  What stops you for putting it the wrong way is the bezel of the cart.
<br />
<br />Since the "back" of the board is on the front of the game... The notchs to stop you from doing that mistake are on the back of the bezel. In that case, since you cannot close the cart, you can enter it any way you want. I will have to be more careful next time.
<br />
<br />What is the best way to test if the board is fried, insert back the original mrom?  If this is the only way then I hope I didn't damage it.  Sometime the chip became hot while trying to remove the solder (the iron was set at around 300 celsius) so I don't know how much tolerance to heat they have.  Worst case is that I have to remake another dev cart from scratch.

<br />
<br />Chips can get damaged if too hot but usually old DIP chips have no problem, this happens with modern tiny surface-mounted chips.
<br />Chips shouldn't get above 100°C or so else their transisors will be damaged. If you apply -5V the chips usually get very hot and never work again, but I don't think you do that even when putting the board backwards.
<br />Yes if you place the original ROM you could test if nothing is damaged (exept if you ROM was damaged). However you'll have to undo the rewiring which sounds annoying.

<br />
<br />I think the programmer I found is decent enough for the kind of things I want to do (program flash epprom only and some common eprom). Just the instruction manual sucks bad (they didn't invest much in that department). Compared to a willem, the leaper-3C comes in a case, can be connected by USB and is very light.  You can even duplicate chips on the go since there is 2 sockets and can use batteries as it power source.  
<br />
<br />This is where I made the second mistake.  One of the socket is written master. So obviously I putted the chip in that one when I did my test at 2h in the morning. After reading the tiny instruction manual more thoroughly today, they put a small warning saying "if you use in PC mode, you must use the slave textool". (...) The software never complained about this. So the programmer was programming nothing but took 3 minutes or so to do it. 
<br />
<br />Unless the board is burnt, there is good chances that after I reprogram the chip properly and connect /WE to 31 that it will work. I'm crossing my fingers now.
<br />
<br />Once it work I will start to build my second dev-cart. Thanks again for the comments.
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />After thinking a little bit more about "why" did they use the slave socket for writing, it does make sense.  In stand-alone mode, the master is read only and the read content is written in the slave one. Why put 2 sockets that could write when you can only write one eprom at a time anyway.  So it does make sense, didn't realize it at the beginning.
<br />
<br />Edit2:
<br />
<br />I fixed pin 31 and re-programmed the eprom.  I now have music on the screen but the screen content is wrong.  It could be that the board is fried or one contact is wrong.  At least now I'm starting to see something. I will try to re-do the wiring job again.

<br />
<br />I tried the original game and my own test files.  I have audio, some of the screen content is garbled.  Either the CHR-RAM is fried or some of the wiring is wrong.  
<br />
<br />I will try to do a quick rewire of the pins with some temporary cable (instead of de-soldering again the socket) and test the original nrom in it to see how it react. Hope the nrom is not fried too.  If anybody has other suggestion for testing, please let me know.
<br />
<br />At least it's not a complete failure. I was able to hear some of my music on the real thing so that made me happy.
<br />
<br />A quick question: should I expect any damage to the board if the soldering iron is set to 325C and while removing solder with wick, I can keep it on a pin for up to 10 seconds?  I just don't know how sensible those boards are.  The traces doesn't seems affected when I tested with my meter.
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />Hmmm... From memory of what I did yesterday,  I may have inverted by accident /WE and 17 since the beginning and never realized it.  Even the pictures I posted seems to imply it. This could be the only issue left and maybe the cart is fine (or I'm just thinking too much at the moment). I will do a sanity check tonight, once I come back from work.
<br />
<br />Edit2: Yes... I inverted 31/30.  I should not do dev carts when I have a strong cold at 2h in the morning, the margin of error is too high in that case.. Once I switch them, I should be able to confirm if it's working or not.

<br />
<br />Since the rom is less than 512k, I just copied the same file many time. I don't know if this is the cause or a coding error that is shown on the real hardware. Any feedback would be more than appreciated.
<br />
<br />What I found with the bending pins technique for famicom cartridges:
<br />
<br />Pro:
<br />- Don't have to cut the trace
<br />- Since you didn't cut the trace, If you do a mistake you can fix it more easily (good thing since it was my first try)
<br />
<br />Con:
<br />- The cables make the socket higher, which make it harder in some situation to fit the cartridge inside the famicom slot. Maybe not an issue on a US nes.
<br />
<br />The final result:
