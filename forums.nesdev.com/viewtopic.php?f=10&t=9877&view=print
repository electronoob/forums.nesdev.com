It doesn't power<br />up at all. The version I have is the one without the 2200uf cap on board. I tried<br />adding a cap there too and still no juice at all. Tried replacing the cap behind the regulator<br />too (it's at V1 or something like that) and it didn't help either. It's not a bad AC as I know it<br />works fine.<br /><br />So with all that said anyone wanna make me feel stupid and point out something obvious<br />I might have missed to get this thing back in action before I throw it in the trash?<br /><br />Thanks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's a bad idea to replace a fuse with a wire. You don't know what caused the fuse to blow. What's going to happen the next time it is powered up now that there is no fuse to protect components on the other side of the fuse? Fuses can be important protection.

I bought a broken snes which had that diode at D1 literally burnt out.  I replaced the diode with a 1n4001, and the 7805 regulator with a new 7805.  I also replaced the fuse, however I bypassed it because I was probing the power and didn't want to blow a good fuse.  I'm not getting any power to my regulator however.  I got 14v coming off the fuse panel points, and 14v going into the cathode on the diode, but nothing on the regulator.  I can't really see how the power is routed.  Anyone have any idea why power isnt getting to my regulator.
