<br />If you can find 2 or 3 people nearby that are willing to test the game for you, you could buy some snacks and beverage, invite them over and throw a small "beta test party". Just have the guys chill out and play the game. You can watch and take notes about things that might need changing/fixing and their opinions. Sounds safe and productive.

I think that whatever friends or acquaintances you can get will do, they'll probably help you out even if it's not terribly fun for them. They're likely to do this as a favor, hence why you should offer something back (snack and stuff) to make the day less boring for them.

<br />Both general and specific solutions would be fine by me.
<br />
<br />But I've come up with a different idea: make a multicart with several minigames that can use the same assets, and each tester would get only one of the minigames. I'll open a new topic about it once more ideas come to me.

Once it's leaked, it doesn't really matter who did it, now anyone/everyone has the game.  The company commissioning the game doesn't want this to happen at all, but it needs to be tested.  Hence, why I suggested a group of individuals who are honest and trustworthy and would beta-test the hell out of any homebrew you threw at them.

<br />
<br />Releasing prototypes which they spent a lot of money for and editing their names in actually protects the community.  If someone grabbed the rom, then tried to pass it off as an authentic proto, it could be authenticated as a copy, and the seller would be discredited.
<br />
<br />Was there a particular incident that discredits them? (I'm not saying everyone on Nintendoage is honest, but that the Beta testers have been in the NES community for a long time and are well trusted and honest people)

<br />Yeah, I was going to ask this.  Why would you just show up and start badmouthing an entire forum without any reasoning or examples?
