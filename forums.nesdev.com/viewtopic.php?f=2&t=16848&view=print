		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />After releasing my two games as free roms, I realized that some emulators will not support the 512kb mapper 2 configuration. I understand this is because the original board only went up to 256kb afaik. Are there any mappers sufficiently similar from the NES heyday that are widely supported in dozens of emulators (like mmc3 is virtually guaranteed due to SMB3 etc. etc.) that I might be able to issue new versions of the games for that would likely have more support in existing emulators?<br /><br />*edit* It occurred to me that now Mapper 30 has been assigned the above configuration, and presumably this website and its wiki are considered the authority for emulator authors to use for mapper documentation, perhaps all I need to do is change the mapper number to 30 to be likely to be supported by more emulators going forward.

You shouldn't change the mapper, your game isn't the problem, the emulator is.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />fwiw, i edited the header in your ROM (with HxD: fceux seems to have parental control against editing headers), and it turned out &quot;iNES mapper #30 is not supported at all&quot; for version 2.2.2. Just to be sure, i tried NES 2.0 format too. So changing mapper wouldn't solve the issue anyway. Eventually, i guess 2.2.2 won't be considered reasonably recent anymore.<br /><br />(deleted the file with the modified header afterwards)

So meta...  I noticed my cycle timed black bar at the top is a little bit jumpy in nesticle though. Not surprising given how early of an emulator it was I suppose.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Maybe to answer the original question:<br /><br /><strong>MMC3</strong> - UxROM 16k PRG banking can be simulated with 2 x 8k PRG banking. 512k PRG + CHR-RAM was a used configuration (e.g. Mega Man 4/6)<br /><strong>MMC1</strong> - MMC1 has 16k PRG banking, main disadvantage is the serial register interface, 512k PRG + CHR-RAM was used (e.g. Dragon Warrior III/IV)<br /><strong>VRC7</strong> - Like MMC3 but Famicom only and relatively rare, 512k PRG + CHR-RAM was used (Lagrange Point)<br /><br /><br />As far as FCEUX goes, the oldest version I can find (2.0.0 circa 2008) runs Owlia and also definitely supports 512k BNROM. I think if 2.2.2 had some problem with Owlia it was not about the PRG size, probably some other transient bug.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">GradualGames wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It occurred to me that now Mapper 30 has been assigned the above configuration, and presumably this website and its wiki are considered the authority for emulator authors to use for mapper documentation, perhaps all I need to do is change the mapper number to 30 to be likely to be supported by more emulators going forward.</div><br />I would say that an emulator is far more likely to have a 512k-accepting mapper 2 than any mapper 30. You should really only use mapper 30 if you need the flash save capability or CHR-RAM banking. (I would doubt there's any emulator out there that supports mapper 30 but not 512k mapper 2?)<br /><br />Memblers' Cheapocabra/GTROM (111) has pretty similar capabilities too.
