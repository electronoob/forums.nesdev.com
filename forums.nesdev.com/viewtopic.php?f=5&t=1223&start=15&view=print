<br />
<br />EDIT: Wait, you actually have to disable a lockout chip for the SNES to run SFC games? I thought that was only the NES, for some reason. Or is it only to play PAL games?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />All SFC/SNES games and console have a CIC, including the japaneese ones. Those CIC are nearly the same that on the NES, exept that there is also japaneese CICs this time (japaneese SFC games still have no seal of quality on them, however).
<br />The common way to bypass it is to have an universal AD-29 adaptater that allow you to plug one licenced card (for CIC lines) and one imported game on the other slot. Since I usually play imported game, I usually always have my adaptater input in my SNES, even to play european games that would work without any adaptater. It doesn't work with DKC, because it is able to detect the adaptater. That isn't a great problem, because I can remove it, but I noticed that.
<br />
<br />And Nintendo lies so much that you'll WANT to download their games for free. I don't see the problems, bastards liars. Also they most probably have too much money. The horrible revolution controller is the proof.

You 100% without a doubt have a SRAM issue or you are playing a 50hz game in 60hz or vice versa, which doesn't sound like the case. You probably have damaged the SRAM circuit, this could have been from reverse biasing the battery or using a really hot iron or anything really.

<br />With it, after showing Rare's and Nintendo's logo, it shows a blue message, saying that the adaptater may damage my console (even if this is SO wrong).
<br />The problem is unrelated to the CIC, since the game cannot see the CIC, and that I have a correct CIC plugged in through the second slot of the adaptater.
