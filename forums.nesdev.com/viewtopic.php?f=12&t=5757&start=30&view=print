I don't have anything against you, you shouldn't take offense to someone with a different opinion than you. And you didn't offend me and I am not angry toward you. And I did give examples in previous posts about the limits of the SNES. 
<br />
<br />Sprite scaling is not possible in hardware or software on the SNES in practice anyway so what you say amount storing multiple sizes of a sprite in ROM would be the only real way to go with that. 
<br />
<br />You say RAM could be used for "other purposes" if graphics are transfered from ROM to VRAM. What other purpose should this RAM be used for? And lots of SNES games already do transfer graphics from ROM to VRAM. The only reason they wouldn't do this is if they use software compression for graphics. 
<br />
<br />While I haven't played Art of Fighting anytime lately I do agree with your statement that without the ROM size limitation and further development time to optimize a port as best they could I'm sure a better port could have been made. 
<br />
<br />Really when it comes to ports of arcade games on superior hardware to the SNES I recommend looking at the best examples of ports that were made such as Mortal Kombat II and Super Street Fighter II. I think you would agree for the SNES these were both very well received ports despite not being close to 1:1 with the arcade original. While the subject of if a perfect or better port is possible is interesting I think it is ultimately futile sense SNK is not interested in producing a new SNES port and I don't believe anyone is interested in reverse engineering a NeoGeo game to then port it to SNES. If they were that would be very cool. 
<br />
<br />naI, I was just making a point about the idea of pushing something to the perceived limit. I would agree that a game with no slowdown is better but how are you to tell by playing a game what is pushing the processor "to the limit". The same can be said about other aspects. It's a strange term to use, pushing a game console to the limit.

If a game lags because it couldn't finish it's game logic in time, it doesn't necessarily mean that the game is pushing limits, it might just mean that it wasn't programmed as efficiently as it could have been.<br /><br />If the sprites disappear it doesn't mean a game is pushing the system to the limits either. Sure it hit a video hardware limitation, but a programmer that really wanted to get rid of this problem could create a drawing system where objects that don't move (or move less than others) were drawn to the background to make the sprite use less intense. Few people did things like this, because it's easier to have a single object drawing system that always uses sprites.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">How about Super FX or SA-1? Wouldn't that be pushing the limits even further by adding a new CPU?</div><br />As is often said by some people on this board when we discuss NES mappers, having hardware extensions doesn't automatically make a good game. Look at Hard Drivin' on the Genesis/MD, or those C64 games with 3D polygons similar to the ones in Starfox. They worked without enhancements, and looked pretty similar to Starfox, they were just slower. The Starfox programmers decided they needed an extra CPU, which is the exact opposite of pushing a system to it's limits. They decided to stay away from the limits and put the load on a second processor, instead of using creativity to try solving the problem in a different way.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I don't think developers were that lazy</div><br />I wouldn't say lazy, I'd say that they were on tight schedules and couldn't dedicate enough time to make sure each project was as good/efficient/fast as they could be. Also, many times they weren't so experienced with the processors or consoles they had to work with. Some were probably lazy though.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The things I see as limits to SNES games mainly are CPU processing power and memory which I think can be complaints on any system.</div><br />The thing is that many developers are scared of these particular limitations and will not even consider trying new things, because in business there is no time for this.<br /><br />The advantage hobbyist programmers have is that there is no pressure. There are no deadlines, no boss nagging you about projects. We have all the time in the world to learn about the systems. I for example have been studying the NES for over 9 years. How much time do you think programmers back in the 80's had to study the platforms? We have the potential to do better, much better than was done back then, but most people don't dare, they are too conservative and think that the current game library is the absolute proof of all that can be done and nobody will ever make anything better.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Both can be added and were added to the SNES in various forms.</div>
<br />If you need to turn a console into a Frankenstein in order to make games for it, you'd better move on to something more powerful and be conservative in that new platform.

You can make a pretty cool video effect using pre-calculated data from ROM in a way that the CPU is not doing much more than giving a few commands to the video system. If it looks more advanced than what that console can ordinarily output, you could say you're pushing some limits. You don't have to stress every single piece of hardware in the console, just have it do something it wasn't designed to do and you are pushing limits.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It's a strange term to use, pushing a game console to the limit.</div>
<br />Not really. I'd define this as "using tricks to make a console do something that is trivial on newer, more advanced consoles". Of course you could just go and use the newer console, which is what professional developers usually do (after a brief period of trying to push the older console to it's limits), but for some of us internet nerds the fun is in seeing how far we can go with an specific console.

But there is a difference between what is technically possible and what is practical in a real world setting. I don't doubt that you can do some crazy things that look amazing on many systems but sometimes while whatever is being done is very impressive it's just not practical for real use in a game. 
<br />
<br />About the two points mentioned. What if the game lags but it was absolutely optimized to the maximum potential? Is it then pushing the system to the limit? Who's to say without the actual source code and studying it if it's efficient or not? About sprites disappearing, what if it just wasn't feasible to do what you say and it was just unavoidable? I just find the whole notion of "pushing to the limit" very much opinion based and not directly related to facts. 
<br />
<br />The whole original point being talked about was trying to achieve something well beyond the limits of the SNES which are cold hard facts. There is no trickery to be done to somehow push the SNES beyond it. 
<br />
<br />Personally I don't find fancy technical work to be as important as designing a good and fun game. You don't need a bag full of tricks if you have a solid game. Some of the tricks are quite cool but aren't needed.

Even if a programmer optimizes an algorithm that performs a particular task to the maximum, who can say there isn't another completely different algorithm that does the same task but more efficiently? The way in which a programmer approaches a problem makes a huge difference, not just how optimally coded the selected solution is. You can code SMB a trillion different ways (which will look exactly the same to a player), the odds of picking the best one are pretty slim.<br /><br />IMO, pushing the limits isn't necessarily using all the resources of a console, but making it look like you are. It's much like magic tricks, it's about what appears to be happening, not what actually is.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">About sprites disappearing, what if it just wasn't feasible to do what you say and it was just unavoidable?</div><br />I proposed one solution (the one I'm using in my sonic game for the NES), there are probably others. The SNES and the MD have enough sprites to cover the whole horizontal area, if they are flickering/disappearing the programmer must have done something wrong.<br /><br />In Sonic 1 (MD) you can see sprites disappearing if you stand on a bridge while invincible. Why the hell did they need all those stars around Sonic? In Sonic 2, the invincibility effect uses way fewer sprites, and it doesn't look any worse. When designing a game, you can make choices that are easier on the hardware, but the trick is not letting the players notice the choices were made because of limitations. If you're having less stars, make them spin really fast in a pseudo-3D path...

If the question is "is a 1:1 port possible?", the answer is clearly "no", but if the intention is to make a really good-looking fighting game, my opinion is that it's certainly possible to do something better than Street Fighter of Mortal Kombat.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Personally I don't find fancy technical work to be as important as designing a good and fun game.

<br />Of course gameplay is more important than graphics, but making the graphics look sophisticated is a good part of the fun. That is my opinion as a game developer, others might not care so much about the graphical presentation.

<br />
<br />This is a good point. I really think some developers just didn't care in some situations but it's hard to really know in some cases what the reason was and ofcourse in the professional world time and money limits get in the way. Generally it was more about making a product that worked good enough than one that was fully refined. 
<br />
<br />Off topic somewhat but in the same alley of unpolished games, has anyone else play Street Fighter Alpha 2 on SNES and been horribly annoyed by all the constant pauses? They seem to be related to loading sound samples for the announcer and things like that. It's absolutely insane and I can't believe they thought all those pauses were OK for a finished game. I speculate that the SPC RAM was not enough to hold all the samples at once but I really think they could have done something better than they did. It's really terrible and a game ruining issue to me.

<br />
<br />Ports 1:1 are obviously not possible (as I said before...) because of colors, resolution and a different video sub-system, but maybe they could have achieved more accurate results if time and ROM weren't so important. I don't say that programmers were lazy, but you can't compare what last SNES games could do (like DKC3) with the first ones did...
<br />There is no point in repeating what <strong>tokumaru</strong> said, I agree 100% with him...

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The SNES and the MD have enough sprites to cover the whole horizontal area, if they are flickering/disappearing the programmer must have done something wrong. </div>
<br />You forgot that sprites can override eachother. This happens a lot in SOM, where you can have 3 players, their 3 weapons, 3 enemies, and possibly other graphical effects (such as splashes or damage indicators) on the same scanline... Of couse this don't happen very regularly, but it DOES happen. Compared to all the flickering of Gradius/Lifeforce/Parodius series on the NES it's not much.
<br />
<br />When it comes to SNES demoscenes, there would probably not be very impressive because.... the hardware features HDMA, that many games used extensively. Most C64/NES demoscenes completely take advantage of mid-frame and midscanline register changes, which is not a standard thing on those systems. But on the SNES it can be done all in hardware very easily, the vast majority of games used that so it would really not be impressive.
<br />Now by using a clever combination of HDMA, Mode 7 or by taking advantage of "tile per offset" mode, some brand new awesome effects that haven't been seen yet could probably be done...

<br />Looking at that page I remembered that there is a cheap (cheap as in not CPU/RAM/ROM intensive) method for scaling sprites that works well if not much scaling is needed.
<br />
<br />Since the large sprites are composed of many smaller ones, if you slowly move all the sprites towards the center of the character it will look like it's shrinking.
<br />
<br />They seem to have used that method for the SNES sprite in that thread, and I believe this was done on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5GaIupGEBc" class="postlink">Yuu Yuu Hakusho - Makyou Toitsusen</a> on the MD. When the players jump to the background plane (C + UP) they shrink a bit.
<br />
<br />It seems it's possible to do some shrinking this way before the sprites get terribly distorted. Also, I imagine tha the smaller the sprites you use to compose the character the better this technique will work (i.e. 8x8 will look better than 32x32).
<br />
<br />Maybe combining this with Mode 7 background scaling will look pretty decent.

<br />
<br />If I remember right, that roughly what Neil's Corlett hack of SD3 creates the 8x16 VWF. Instead of moving sprites, you move the pixels towards the center of the tile.

A song like "One Winged Angel" from FFVII ("Bells frogs Bing cherries jingle bells ham and cheese SEPHIROTH!") could have been done on the Super NES. ("SEPHIROTH!")</div>
<br />It could have been done in a way similar to Tales of Phantasia's intro song I guess, but couldn't work in a .spc dump.
<br />Note than those voice samples are stored spearately from other samples on FF7's CD (and they are stored in all 3 CDs even if only used on the last), so the game probably does some trick with those as well.
<br />
<br />And I'm pretty sure this is NOT the actual lyrics, they are supposed to be latin and I found them someowhere once (altough they're not written in my OST's manual).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's a joke about the quality and general sound of the lyrics. They are latin and you can find a rough translation of what they are saying. But if you look at the lyrics (Bells Frogs, etc) and listen it really does sound like it could be that.
<br />
<br />FF7 works similar to older consoles in that the sound processor uses samples to play the song rather than just streaming music from the disc since the disc must be free to load assets while in battle as every single asset cannot fit into memory at once. There is a trick to exploit this behavior too. You cast Regen on your party and then another spell and after regen is cast you open the CD lid and the battle will not proceed until it can load the new spell so you can regenerate all your health without fear of being attacked.
