		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have been modifying my game engine to use 16 bits for Y coordinates even though I am constraining my game to be horizontal side scrolling. This is so I can allow the character to jump beyond the top of the screen, and to allow for bottomless pits and proper meta sprite clipping.
<br />
<br />In doing so, I encountered some subtle bugs involving the carry bit. I had a few places in my code where I would have a couple of adc's or sbc's right in a row next to each other:
<br />
<br />adc something
<br />adc something
<br />
<br />etc.
<br />
<br />This is fine for 8 bits, but once you enter the 16 bit realm, you may accumulate a +1 in that second adc that you didn't want. So, you have to do the adds in steps, clear the carry, or in my case I was adding several constants together so I just allowed the assembler to add them for me and turned it into a single adc.
<br />
<br />I had known to clear the carry before most adds in my code for a while---however I guess I overlooked the "accumulation" factor that could occur if you use multiple adc's or sbc's.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When you say "this is fine for 8 bits" it can be a bit misleading. I know you meant it's fine to not clear the carry between additions <strong>when you know for sure that none of them will generate a carry</strong>, but from your statement some might understand that it's OK to not clear the carry if they're doing any kind of 8-bit math, which is not true, so I figured I'd say something.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Tokumaru, that's right: I didn't mean for any 8 bit math. My bugs came from a situation like:
<br />
<br />clc
<br />adc
<br />adc
<br />adc
<br />
<br />where I knew I was well between 0 and 256 when I was using 8 bit Y. But when I switched to 16 bits, I still had those adc's for the low byte and then a single adc #0 for the high byte---I got more carries than I wanted and my character was standing 1 pixel above a platform at the top of the screen (because some of the Y calculations passed a boundary that affected the high byte).
