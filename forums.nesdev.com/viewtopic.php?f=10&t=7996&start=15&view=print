I doubt the kernel is 4MB.<br /></div><br /><br />The core kernel of the PSX version was a little under a meg.. it sat about the 700k mark. The game banked in several engines from the CD-ROM depending on the game state. The kernel actually would load modules in the background while you played the game and then switched to that gamestate when needed. The modules were menu, field, world map, battle, and minigame. The PC port did away with the module swap and just compiled it all together into a 4MB executable. Things like the menu layout, which used to be a separate module in the PSX was integrated into the executable itself in the PC version, so the engine was about 4 meg, the kernel that ran the show was much less. The point I was making was FF7 took up three CD-ROMS, but the full engine  in relation is quite tiny. (and on all three disks) <br /><br />All final fantasies do this, including the first one. The first had a kernel, an aux kernel, battle, field, overworld, and dungeon. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">* The save ram can get a little heavy.

<br />
<br />The FF7 <a href="http://wiki.qhimm.com/FF7/Savemap" class="postlink">savemap</a> is 0x10ED bytes (4333 bytes) long, minus the header info.  Most of that is a save of the main work memory for the game which is irrelevant when porting to the NES. 
<br />
<br />In the end, it's a complete waste of time. I agree. But it's also a hobby, which by definition, is a *supposed* to be a complete waste of time. I have no problems poking at the idea with a stick. Take a look at the guy who ported Halo to the 2600. 
<br />
<br />What happened was I was watching some romhacking guys do some gorgeous stuff with the FF7 nes version, and thought as a neat programming exercise  and to oblige them with a better engine. Because I've never done 6502 machine code outside of reversing and rewriting small programs. I'd thought I would take it up a notch.
<br />
<br />However, I've never really worked with the NES architecture before. I'm no stranger to 6502 code, and I do projects in C# all the time, but while getting down to the nuts and bolts of it, I'm not sure on all the mappers yet, and I'm unfamiliar with the linker. Most of my 6502 code has really just been one-shot less than 16k stuff. I need a good bank-switching template and a mapper that fits my needs. I'll hammer everything out as I learn. Heck, my first thing to do is to make a squaresoft logo, and then see of I can draw a static menu page, pulling variables from ram. I'm nowhere near even making a map yet.
<br />
<br />And... I've thinking about doing a project like this for several years. It just when the FF7NES romhacking thing came to life, I decided to give it a shot.
<br />
<br />Anywho... Back on subject...
<br />
<br />Here's a rundown of mappers I have found
<br />
<br />-UxROM - Out due to lack of RAM
<br />-BNROM Out due to lack of RAM
<br />-MMC3 - The 245 Mapper variant gives me 1MB and a sexy scanline IRQ (In FF7, the battle menu takes up the bottom of the screen, this might be useful!)
<br />-MMC5 - 1MB, but waaay to much going on. 
<br />-SxROM If Both CHR 0 and CHR 1 are supported, this gives me 1MB on an MMC1 mapper. I'll experiment with this configuration tonight and see if emulators support that.

<br />After all, you are perfectly right. Still I consider the chinese port to be a piece of crap but if you can hack it to improve it why not it might be interesting.
<br />
<br />Also you talk about the lack of WRAM on UxROM. It's true that UNROM and UOROM boards made by Nintendo does not have any WRAM. However, iNES mapper 2 is meant to be technically compatible with UxROM, not to be UxROM. This is very important to understand, as mapper 2 can allow you to get way more ROM, up to 2MB with the last bank always fixed at $c000-$ffff (unlike the MMC1), it can also allow you to use WRAM and why not a battery, to use 4-screen mirroring, a trainer, etc... 
<br />
<br />In addition to this it would be pretty simple to do this in hardware, it would only take a couple of chips. But anywhere producing any fake FF7 cartridge would be highly illegal.

<br />Let's consider it from a different angle of view. If you'd spend millions of money and time to make a playstation game that is acclaimed by many as one of the best RPGs ever made, would you be happy if some random guys make a so-called port of it on the NES stealing your cration but being a total piece of crap ? Probably not.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />After lots of hand-wringing, swearing, and watching Captain America, I decided that the mapper to go with was the one I started with....
<br />
<br />Mapper 163.
<br />
<br />I'm actually learning a lot about how the mapper operates by looking at the code and writing my own bank-switch routines...
<br />
<br />However, I have a bit of a conundrum. 
<br />
<br />When mapper 163 powers on, it places the "bottom" bank (i.e. the bank with the highest number) at the "bottom" of ram. Like this...
<br />
<br />$8000
<br />.bank_00
<br />$C000
<br />.bank_01
<br />$FFFF
<br />
<br />This is the config I have now, and my code "grows" from $8000 down to $FFFF
<br />
<br />However, when you have more than 32 banks, (which I will have, but not now), it places banks $1E and $1F at the "bottom". You can add banks all the way to the 2GB limit, and it will power up in the $1E/$1F configuration. 
<br />
<br />$8000
<br />.bank_1E
<br />$C000
<br />.bank_1F
<br />$FFFF
<br />
<br />The issue is I would like to "assign" banks to source files. I would like to have my first file I code be bank 1F, and then tell the linker to insert 31 empty banks "above" my code so that the system will load with me in the proper bank. The kicker is the *second* bank I want to assign is bank $01, which will have an empty bank above and empty banks below (all the way to Bank 1F, where my init code is). This will probably have something to do with linker mapping and segment decelerations.
<br />
<br />Any ideas on how to approach this?
<br />
<br />---EDIT---
<br />Because I can't got to sleep, I tried to tackle the ld65 documentation again. There are some promising ideas in there with the MEMORY{} command SEGMENT{} command and liberal use of the .bss segment. 
<br />
<br />BSS? == BullSh*t Segment? 
<br />
<br />Any further help? My goal is  to master this scary linker and have it do my job for me.

It's not hard to change mappers once you've reached the limitations. So I'd still suggest starting with something more better known like FME-7. It supports up to 512KB of PRG (with 8KB banking), PRG-RAM (aka WRAM aka SRAM) and a nice CPU cycle based IRQ counter. FCEUX even supports 2MB PRG-ROM according to <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Sunsoft_FME-7#Emulator_Compatibility_and_Behavior">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Suns ... d_Behavior</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The issue is I would like to "assign" banks to source files.</div>
<br />You need to create a memory specification and a segment specification for each bank. In the source file then switch to the segment with ".segment".
