<br />Koei had a knack for doing that - EMIT games use it exclusively.
<br />
<br />Also, anything wrong with my Dragon Slayer II hack? Just curious, did you just miss mine, or should I redump the game using your code select?
<br />
<br />Also^2, yay for Tsukikomori. That's the second to last Pandora Box SNES game that's missing (and the other one has pretty much the most horrible music I've ever heard on SNES).

<br />C027E3?? is for the same game. It's a bit of help, because the game doesn't want to be easily ripped, but could have easier ripping if you get all the overall sections of music and a few load addresses to go with them. I'm guessing there's not really any overlap in song numbers, but I'm also not inclined to go looking for a debug menu that would sort the whole game out.

<br />Wizap!: Ankoku no Ou:
<br />ROM should be deinterleaved (NSRT Checksum 0xA944). Search ROM for string 0xc0a91d22ce. Change the third byte to have different songs play during the intro screen

<br />Okay, thanks, wanted to make sure you didn't duplicate the data for Wizap either. 
<br />
<br />In case anyone's curious, I'm shooting for pack #3 release this weekend, there's already enough stuff posted to have the 30 rips per pack quota.

<br />Apparently, the address in the file(not accounting for a header) should be:
<br />1897A-1897B for the codes.
<br />
<br />I made a utility to convert LoRom addresses(808000-BFFFFF) into file addresses, and the other way around. Should be useful for removing the guesswork in finding the referenced code address.

<br />
<br />Ah, this turned out to be a ZSNES issue. SNES9x handles the code fine, will need to rip from it (or see if older ZSNES versions don't have the problem).
<br />
<br />And actually finding the offset in the file is pretty easy with MESS debugger (Ctrl-D, jump to the offset you provide, note few bytes, search the rom, if you get more than one result expand the search value by a byte or so).

<br />- Fune Taro (ふね太郎 in Japanese)
<br />- Mario's Early Years Series (The three games in the series share music, and one of those is the Title Screen.)
<br />- Marko's Magic Football (I couldn't get past the Acclaim Presents Logo on SNES9X, and bsnes doesn't rip SPCs yet. Because I am on a PPC Mac running 10.4.11, I can't use ZSNES.)
<br />- Universal Solider
<br />
<br />I also have a Sound Test pack of Yume Maboroshi no Gotoku using a code I made, but I need a bankswitching code also... so far I have accessed banks 1, 2, and 4 in-game. 1 has 23 songs, all from 03-19 (in hex), 02 has 6 songs (05, 06, 0A, 0D, 14 and 16 work, but the others are empty), and 04 has 1 song (06 only. The others are empty.). I need a code that will allow me to bankswitch songs so I can examine if there are more songs. So far, I have 30, but if there are more, then I could use a code... or a hack, provided you tell me where to search (as in, various values in hex in order, and I'll search for 'em. Then tell me which byte to modifiy, and I'll do just that. I can modify the song via a PAR code, but I can't manually bankswitch.) and which byte to modify. I prefer the Introduction, which uses song 03 bank 01.
<br />
<br />If you want a dump of what I have so far, then go ahead and ask me. I have 23 tracks idenitified, but they're at the start up to Chapter 2 (I never got through Chapter 2 due to general cluelessness, and I have an <a href="http://jouhousilicagel.hp.infoseek.co.jp/game_yumemaboroshi/backhistory.html" class="postlink">online Japanese walkthrough</a>... I could use a translation.

<br />
<br />Hey, is Tsukikomori one of those games that uses bank-switching for song IDs? I had this with Yume Maboroshi no Gotoku.
<br />
<br />I could use that for Yam Yam! I also have a volume modifier that corrects volume problems in-game.
<br />
<br />I had 20-something tracks before the hard disk fried, and I almost finished the game. However, I accidentally corrupted the save file utilzing one of the codes.

Great stuff, would love to see these appear on snesmusic somehow eventually.</div>
<br />
<br />I had an incomplete rip of Gamera containing stage music, with the first one done. I lost it with the fried hard drive... but I do have a dump on the spcdumpers Yahoo group in the incomplete section. It has two extra SPCs (none of 'em I think are stage themes, but one of them is the Title Screen. The other is a Game Over track, and I later found that with no SFX at the start.) with the original four I picked up.
<br />
<br />I had about 40 tracks for Soreyuke Ebisumaru! Karakuri Meiro - Kieta Goemon no Nazo!! before I lost it. I did not beat the game. I have at least about 15 or so tracks in the spcdumpers Yahoo group in the Incomplete section.
<br />
<br />I tried Race Drivin' and had channel muting problems, so I left behind an incomplete dump in the spcdumpers group.
<br />
<br />I have music modifier codes for some of the games that I invented myself. Those games are (as far as I recall):
<br />
<br />Ren and Stimpy: Veediots! (Grand Total: 10 tracks.)
<br />Steel Talons (Mission Music Only: Three other pieces of music are in there: The Title Screen, the Victory Music, and the Options when you press Start at the Title Screen.) (Grand Total: About 16-20 tracks.)
<br />Shinri Game 3 (Grand Total: 8 tracks, not counting repeats.)
<br />Esparks (Grand Total: 24 tracks.)
<br />
<br />If you want a track count for some of the undumpable games, then I got them:
<br />
<br />Pit Fighter (1 track! That's it!)
<br />Paperboy 2 (2 tracks: One of them is non-looping.)
<br />Relef Pitcher (2 tracks: One of them is an in-game organ tune. The other plays when you're selecting a team.)

<br />
<br />ugetab, if you're feeling like doing more stuff, could you look at these games?
<br />
<br />Sangokushi Seishi Tenbu Spirits (<a href="http://vgrebirth.org/games/game.asp?id=17403" class="postlink">http://vgrebirth.org/games/game.asp?id=17403</a>) - last unripped SNES Wolf Team game. It's no Tales of Phantasia, but has some nice tunes. Music most probably by Motoi Sakuraba and Ryota Furuya (they scored the PC98 original).
<br />
<br />Devil's Course (<a href="http://vgrebirth.org/games/game.asp?id=18102" class="postlink">http://vgrebirth.org/games/game.asp?id=18102</a>), Harukanaru Augusta (<a href="http://vgrebirth.org/games/game.asp?id=9203" class="postlink">http://vgrebirth.org/games/game.asp?id=9203</a>), Harukanaru Augusta 2: Masters (<a href="http://vgrebirth.org/games/game.asp?id=10086" class="postlink">http://vgrebirth.org/games/game.asp?id=10086</a>), Harukanaru Augusta 3: Masters New (<a href="http://vgrebirth.org/games/game.asp?id=17974" class="postlink">http://vgrebirth.org/games/game.asp?id=17974</a>) - T&amp;E golf games. Those have unusually nice music for a sports game (just try the Mega Drive VGM packs). There's a (complete?) pack for Devil's Course on Zophar, but it's dumped horribly (missing first notes on almost all tracks).
<br />
<br />Chibi Maruko-chan: Mezase! Minami no Island!!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had a partial dump of Devil's Cource AKA Wicked 18, but I lost that due to a fried hard drive. I only had a few pieces of music (Title Screen, Main Menu, one game music tune, and some jingles.), plus composer info thanks to ROM text.
<br />
<br />As for Gon, I was still in the middle of gameplay. Based on actual gameplay, the composer is missing because the credits are missing. I had 9 out of 10 of Caitsith2's tunes dumped, with the only one of the tunes being a looping tune. I grabbed some actual musical pieces (which included a two-noter... plus when Gon gets angry after taking too many hits).
<br />
<br />I can upload Natsuki Crisis Battle with added composer info to the spcdumpers group... but I'll have to get the Staff Roll music first. There is an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQv-89Kquo" class="postlink">ending video on YouTube</a> that contains the staff roll, complete with composer info. The composers listed are Sabakuma Yuki, which I know because I did a game with this person composing it, and the other two are Tomo Chan and AKP. It sounds like you got the naming down at the least, so I wouldn't mind taking a shot at it.
<br />
<br />I have 23 out of 25 tunes idenitified for Super F1 Hero, but I have no composer because the credits are missing. Would anyone like to give it a shot and try to see if track numbers 4 and 12 in the Sound Test are used in the game? I have every other track done for idenitification.
<br />
<br />Speaking of which... here's my sound test dump for Yume Maboroshi no Gotoku as of 9/13/08. It's likely not the complete collection, though. Anyways, so far, I have 23 out of the 30 sound test tracks identified. The only problem I have is that I have general cluelessness gameplay-wise (I did access the ending via a SRM file I found online) although a walkthrough in Japanese partially remedies this (although I still got stuck...).

<br />I have 19 tracks for Yuujin no Furi Furi Girls so far if you want to know what I've been doing with some other games...
<br />
<br />I have a complete sound test dump for Esparks. I'm in the middle of trackname idenitifying from the Staff Roll, which you can find <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8JIMRl4oRE" class="postlink">here</a>. I have a guess composer-wise...
