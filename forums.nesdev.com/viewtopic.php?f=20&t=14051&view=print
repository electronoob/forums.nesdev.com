		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey!<br /><br />I'm writing up a series of GB hacking pages, starting of with reverse engineering the pocket station (going to re-program the CPLD once reversed to see how close I got), then going onto defeating copy protection on GBA games (YES! I have found a bunch of GBA bootlegs with actual copy protection, smart stuff too!), and a few other projects I have going on.<br /><br />This is my first real go at 'blogging' so feel free to jump in and give pointers. I've started a FB page where you'll find links to my latest blogs.<br /><br />Also happy to do a section on coding mappers in CPLD's, I'm building a NES USB flash cart so that'll be documented too, as well as my new NES cart dumper which will be available in a couple of weeks. Anything related you want to see, we can make it happen.<br /><br />Lots going on!<br /><br />Come by and say hi.<br /><br />Ben

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wait, this isn't about Sony's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PocketStation" class="postlink">first attempt at a handheld in the PlayStation family</a>?<br /><br />There was a GBA Video cartridge with a mapper that had the movies <em>Shrek</em> and <em>Shark Tale</em> on it. (Not to be confused with a 2-in-1 <em>game</em> cartridge that had video game adaptations of <em>Shrek 2</em> and <em>Shark Tale</em>.) Usually a GBA Video cartridge holds about 45 minutes of compressed video (half a movie) in 32 MiB, the maximum GBA cart size without a mapper, but this video is about 4 times as long. Was the <em>Shrek and Shark Tale</em> cartridge ever reverse engineered?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Forgot to link - wwww.facebook.com/BennVennElectronics<br /><br />No, not the playstation gadget, a gameboy powered cart 'cloning' device.<br /><br />The gba cart I own is a bootleg of 'the hulk' but others have contacted me with copies of pokemon which also cannot be dumped.<br /><br />When dumping the cart stays in a high-z state. Sequential or random access reads are all of a floating bus.<br />The GBA can read the cart fine so it must be either timing or read sequence to unlock the cart. <br /><br />I applied external 3.3v to the cart, booted it in the gba then moved it to my dumper and tried a dump. All I could get was a header with 'nlEncrypted' repeated over and over. Bizarre huh!?!?<br /><br />I might take a look for the shrek cart.

Marketing it to retro gaming stores where you can go in and transfer saves to and from your carts, for save battery replacements/backups etc...
