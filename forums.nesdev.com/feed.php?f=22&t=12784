Apparently I'm giving everyone here a review on their game I guess. <br /><br />Anyway.<br /><br />- Music is some of the best I've heard. All songs are catchy and unique and sound great. <br /><br />- The game mechanics are good. The player controls just fine. <br /><br />- My only real suggestions are to try and make the levels more diverse design wise. For example I can just spam the attack and mash right on the D-pad and pretty much beat the game. It would be great if the levels offered more variety so that I can't just use this one strategy all the time for the whole game. Maybe make some levels where you have to climb up or down a little. Or go to the right then up then left then up then right in like a little cave or something. <br /><br />- A more diverse group of enemies might also improve the game. Say for example an enemy which can't be killed or an enemy which will kill you if you touch it only once. It just seems as if all the enemies seem the same. <br /><br />- Boss battles are good though. <br /><br />- Also how do you know which power up scrolls will give you which special ability? Is it just random? <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQCAeVY6P8c&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQCAeVY ... e=youtu.be</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6785">Erockbrox</a> — Sat Nov 04, 2017 9:24 pm</p><hr />

What are you talking about? Vigilante Ninja 2 is awesome! It took me a while to get used to the physics. The game was challenging and hard, but once I got used to the physics, I've been passing levels in a row. The bosses are very well-made and it feels very rewarding when I finish them. The game seems short, but it's one of the best NES homebrew platformers that I've played so far. Please don't delete it! The game is awesome! I'd like to see more of such games as well as Super Bat Puncher. If only there was some kind of a permissive-open-source game engine for the NES that utilized nice physics so that we could all be coding games rather than coding engines and system stuff.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6924">8bitMicroGuy</a> — Sat Oct 14, 2017 2:56 pm</p><hr />

Sonic levels are built out of huge chunks (256x256 pixels in Sonic 1 and CD, 128x128 pixels in 2, 3 &amp; Knuckles) for a reason. You don't need much detail when you're zipping through a path designed for speed, so the game gets away with repeating large chunks of terrain over and over.<br /><br />I don't consider the classic Sonic games to be all about speed, though. In Sonic 1 there are zones that are absolutely nothing about speed, such as Marble and Labyrinth, but they're still fun to play (Labyrinth less so, because of the slowness of moving underwater and the fear of drowning). I really like to explore, get a better sense of the architecture of the levels, look for hidden rooms and items... You can't do that if you're zooming through every stage.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Oct 12, 2017 9:12 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Alp wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The number of screens shouldn't really be a problem, if the gameplay difficulty is well balanced.<br /></div><br /><br />It really depends on the style of game. I think once you move beyond single-screen, it definitely is a factor to consider. Think of a game like Sonic, for example. One of the things that makes the game so fun is those parts you can go speeding through freely. As the player, I would be disappointed if the levels were too small to allow for it. I don't think it's a good solution to put the player through 4 really annoyingly difficult screens to increase the time it takes to beat a level. I would much rather go through 32 screens that aren't as challenging, but are more interesting.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Thu Oct 12, 2017 7:45 am</p><hr />

Cowlitz 2 was my first attempt at level design. Not having done it before, I read a handful of articles, and then started watching longplays of games in a similar genre. First, I checked the big ones: Bubble Bobble, Loderunner, Donkey Kong, etc. Then I  started digging through obscure ones, for Spectrum, Amiga, etc., asking myself, when I saw a level, how I could try to achieve a similar result within our game's constraints.<br /><br />I printed tiny booklets of graphs at our game's gameplay area (16x12 metatiles) and spent a long time putting them on paper first, then probably each stage received some nunber of revisions after playtesting by testers of varying skill.<br /><br />Anyway, one of the articles I found suggested starting a design by drawing an intended path for completing a stage.<br />Then, decide what obstacles keep the player on the path (walls, spikes, vines, etc), what obstacles interfere with the path (enemies), and what alternatives to the path are there?  (Perhaps a risk/reward branch from the path that's more dangerous and not mandatory for completion)<br /><br />Being a co-op game, I had to make sure there was a successful path for each player (often different for interest), and our game mechanics helped with the risk /reward (not only are there mandatory items to collect, but also optional ones that offer additional rewards).<br /><br />Hopefully that could be helpful. I'll try to track down the articles and post them too.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5942">M_Tee</a> — Wed Oct 11, 2017 9:57 pm</p><hr />

I think it's great that you reflected honestly on the game and mistakes that were made during the design process. One of the things I also underestimated in designing a game is the challenge of making it fun to play. When I envisioned my side-scrolling shooter (similar in gameplay to yours), I guess I just assumed it would be fun. Once the whole engine was built, and I created a test level, I was surprised at how much I had a to tweak to make it challenging/interesting, but not too easy or too difficult. I still haven't finished the game, partially because designing fun levels/AI is so challenging.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Tue Oct 10, 2017 2:02 pm</p><hr />
