<br />How the heck does one even go about doing that? I might like to "ask Konami" if I could make a NES game that's a big ripoff of Castlevania, but what, do I just call 1-800-KONAMI and say "can I ripoff Castlevania for my NES port"? I'm sure it's some sort of huge shindig where trying to reach the person able to give you that information would be like trying to get one of the player's attention from the nosebleed section at a packed sports event.
<br />
<br />Also, if you get declined the rights, you wouldn't want to go through developing your game. If you just rip off a game without asking for the rights, then they might be like "Oh, well he didn't ask for the rights." But if you rip off a game after being declined, they'll say "Hey, I specifically told that guy he couldn't have the rights! Jail for 1,000 years!"

<br />
<br />- From what you mentioned, <strong>yes</strong>, you are correct. By the way, there's no Sonic for the NES and, like I said, they have no way to produce cartridges because the thing is too old. Let's try again - I don't think absurd, as that Sonic game doesn't look llike a "big ripoff of the original SEGA Genesis Sonic", but a fan-made game.
<br />
<br />- Again, there's a couple of flash games that's a BIG ripoff... and what's up? As far as I know... nothing. We have Pac Man, Street Fighter II and many others. Fan games, in Flash. We have a fan game, in 6502.

<br />Nor does Arkanoid. And some revisions of Konami's Top Gun don't have music during gameplay either, instead having some sort of engine noise. The one I owned on cart had the Top Gun theme at the title screen and a "Danger Zone" sound-alike during the attract mode demo, but engine noise during play. But I've been told other revisions play the "Danger Zone" sound-alike during play.
<br />
<br />If you think you can't get in trouble for a too-similar clone, look at The Great Giana Sisters for Commodore 64. The art style and level design were so similar to that of SMB1 that Nintendo could easily bully Rainbow Arts into recalling the game.

<br />If parodies are legal, tokumaru should just turn his Sonic clone into a Sonic parody and that should do the trick. That can also explain the different physics. The official Castlevania parody for the NES, Boko Dracula Kun, have very different physics of actual Castelvania games.
<br />
<br />Celius is doing a Castlevania parody I guess so it should be legal anyway.
<br />
<br />But what exactly differs a parody from a clone ? It doesn't use the exact same graphics, and doesn't take itself seriously ? Does lowering the number of colors consider as not re-using the same graphics ?

<br />A parody is a work that uses elements of another work to make a comment on that other work. For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Done_Gone" class="postlink"><em>The Wind Done Gone</em></a> by Alice Randall uses elements of Margaret Mitchell's <em>Gone With the Wind</em> to criticize the white-centric viewpoint of <em>GWTW</em>. In video games, early versions of <a href="http://www.pineight.com/lj/" class="postlink">Lockjaw</a> were intended to make a comment on the futility of playing against some Tetris DS players, and this mode is still there (as "Garbage level 4"). But if I use elements of work A solely to make a comment on work B, it's not a parody (<a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=9th&amp;navby=docket&amp;no=9655619" class="postlink"><em>Dr. Seuss v. Penguin Books</em></a>).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Slightly offtopic, but here are some general thoughts on using copyrighted/trademark characters in homebrew games:
<br />
<br />There's hardly a way around using them if you're creating some kind of direct tribute to the respective original game, of course, but I've often seen them in homebrew games in an effort to either benefit from the popularity of these characters or to avoid the need for creating original artwork.
<br />
<br />Imho, it hurts the reception of your game in the two latter cases, not only because it has that rip-off feel to it, but also because homebrew games have a tendency to fall short in the direct comparison to a full-blown commercial game and using artwork of commerical games provokes such a comparison.
<br />
<br />I believe that original artwork and character design always is a big plus.
<br />
<br />What I found especially useful both for prototyping and creating final artwork is 3d modelling/rendering.
<br />Creating, drawing and animating a character in still 2d pictures alone can be a very daunting task and it takes both artistic skill and a lot of practice to get acceptable results.
<br />I'm not saying that 3d modelling doesn't take skill, but you can work way more rational and methodic than with traditional animation.
<br />Also, 3d modelling tools considerably easen many of the hard parts like proportions and animation and also add a whole lot of flexibility.
<br />
<br />I don't know if you remember the characters from my SNES game N-Warp Daisakusen.
<br />Although I personally don't think they look that way, alot of people believed they were all hand-drawn in 2d, but they are actually direct 3d renderings, created with Blender.
<br />I disabled all the shading and filtering and used 16 color textures in order to be able to directly export the render output to the SNES sprite graphics format.
<br />I believe the same concept could easily be applied to create graphics for NES games.
<br />Not even with the intent of creating fluid, detailed or realistic graphics, just as a rapid prototyping system.
<br />It's easy once you get the hang of it.
<br />
<br />Ok, that was really offtopic now...

<br />Well, it sure isn't easy or rapid to learn how to use Blender but I'll do it someday...
<br />
<br />Also the models for Donkey Kong Country games were 3D and were downscaled to sprites for the SNES.

<br />
<br />So despite my avatar for this site, I really don't think I'm going to do any Nintendoizations of CV graphics or music for my game. With that, these are the only things I would have to worry about for legal issues:
<br />
<br />-ChateauLeVania (title)
<br />-Hearts and Subweapons
<br />-Progress map
<br />-Candles
<br />-Level up system (only a ripoff in combination with the other things)
<br />
<br />All the story, artwork, music, map data, enemy data will be done by me. I have told people that my game will play pretty much just like CV SOTN, so I admit that it's kind of supposed to be a ripoff. I could easily change the title to "The Curse of Chateau LeVeaux", which is the name of the book that the game is based off of, but ChateauLeVania is just so damn perfect.
<br />
<br />Could I get in trouble for having the same subweapons with candles that drop hearts which you use to power those? The level up system by now can't really belong specifically to CV. You kill enemies, gain experience, get better health and MP. So what's my uh, danger level of getting in trouble at this point?

Ninja Gaiden uses this idea too but the objects are not the same in every level. Experience leveling up is an idea. 
<br />
<br />The copyrighted works are like program code, artwork, music, level layout data in its exact form. The idea though of a platformer with various aspects can't be owned though. You could make your own platformer similar to Castlevania and as long as you don't steal any art or other such resources but make everything on your own, they can't do anything. They don't own Dracula, Frankenstein, Bats, Zombies, Castles, gothic stuff, etc. Just use common sense.

<br />sta $2000
<br />sta $2001
<br />
<br />because it has been copirighted by Nintendo in 1983 when they released Donkey Kong oh the FC release day ? You'd have to wait 2053 so that the code falls into public domain and you can use it ?
<br />
<br />@Celius : Your game sound a parody, and "ChateauLeVania" is a perfect title. You should definitely not do bland copy of graphics, level or stuff, but you definitely don't want to remove all reference to Castlevania else it won't be a Castlevania parody any longer and it will not be as fun. Just like they shaved Goku's hair off and removed all Dragon Ball references in "Dragon Power" for the USA version, it looks completely stupid.
<br />
<br />And in some way any vido game that fratues EXP, levels, and stats (so almost every RPG in existance) could be a copiright infligrement to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, if it weren't for what MottZilla said. So yeah, use common sense, and everything will be okay. Also if nothing gets commercial the change that you get in trouble or get sued probably decreases by 99% or so.

<br />
<br />But say I wanted to have like an Axe Knight in my game. Is that too specific? It's an armored knight that's tall and throws axes at you. I guess the biggest concern would be calling it the "Axe Knight". A ghost knight that throws axes at you I guess isn't too out there to incorporate in my game.
<br />
<br />I think my game is a bit more than just a parody. If my game were just a parody, it would just be funny and everything would be kind of a joke. Though the story is pretty preposterous, I do want to have some level of seriousness.
<br />
<br />And also, I never had any intent on copying graphics from the NES CV games. I honestly think they look pretty bad in some spots (especially like the moss and annoying night blue sky in the background). I look at games like Batman ROTJ for inspiration (the graphics, besides being just completely amazing, remind me of circle of the moon somehow). The only other Nintendoizations I've done were from SOTN.
<br />
<br />Another thing. What if I say openly that my game is supposed to be like CV? It sounds like a bad idea, I just want to be sure.
