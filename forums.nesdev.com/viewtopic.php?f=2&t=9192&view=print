It works with win32 make as well. From there I believe targeting different boards is more about your source .segments and memory map cfg file. <br /><br />Not directly related suggestion: I use Notepad++ with NppExec plugin. Nice customizable syntax highlighting and it's somewhat trivial to set it up NppExec with a run command that runs the make (assemble and link and launch emu) and capture console output which will allow you to double clink on any errors/warnings and open the file and bring you to the offending line. As well I use <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=6773" class="postlink">Nintendulator DX</a> with all the nice add-ons for debugging, it's awesome.

I might however make my own, there's a lot of features on that that I won't use.<br /><br />Concerning your suggestion, I'm on a Linux machine, so no Notepad++, unfortunately.<br /><br />Thanks cpow for the link! Looking at the linker script (an INI file?) it seems trivial, though I don't know why all ROM0..14 refer to the same location and length (it's just multiple alias for the same location?), and what's the &quot;file=%O&quot; setting means. Guess I'll RTFM then <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.<br /><br />Oh, SNROM is one of the &quot;big&quot; MMC1 configuration available. So I figure ROM0..14 is the first 15 16KiB banks available at $8000-$BFFF and ROM15 is the fixed last bank at $C000-$FFFF. I think that a useful macro to use with that mapper is a one like NEWBANK, that pads the remaining space of the bank and set PC to $8000. That's not generalisable to other mappers though.

In other words, in any given module, you don't know where in segment (bank) the linker will place your code (unless you put all of it in a single module, which is not &quot;the right thing&quot; to do with CA65+LD65).

Any source file can place code into any segement or multiple segments (in my assembly projects so far, I have preferred one monolithic translation unit to having several object files, but you can split it up as you like). You can easily control padding bytes (fill/fillval), and where precisely to put things in the ROM or RAM.<br /><br />The basics of it is that the MEMORY regions that output to file will be output in the order specified. The SEGMENTS regions go into the the MEMORY regions, filling up each one in the order specified. Your source code then specifies a segment for any code to go into at someplace in the code. If you want a new bank, create a MEMORY block for it and as many SEGMENT sections as you need to divide it up. The MEMORY regions can also represent blocks of memory, not part of the output ROM.<br /><br />The AOROM source shows how I made 32k banks. The swap tests show how I made code that is stored in ROM that can get copied to RAM (SEGMENT has a load memory region, but also a run memory region; load is where it goes in the ROM, run affects the program counter). Note: the swap test for Sunsoft 5B does not properly set up banks; this is because I was lazy and also because it was unnecessary due to how the banks are already initialized by the PowerPak before swapping.

The makefile is small and I don't need to scroll through it. Usually, I even put my &quot;make vars&quot; in a separate file and I include it in the real makefile for that purpose, so I don't play with my makefile.

If you're already well versed in make, it's probably not a problem at all, but for learning NES programming on cc65, I'm not sure they're very helpful.<br /><br />Example makefiles are great to have around, to show people who need it how to set one up. I'm just suggesting that they don't really need to be part of a beginner's guide to cc65.
