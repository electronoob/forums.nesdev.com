		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I found it fascinating several games actually have uncompiled code in their unused secitons of ROM !!<br /><a href="http://tcrf.net/Category:Games_with_leftover_code" class="postlink">http://tcrf.net/Category:Games_with_leftover_code</a><br />How can programmers make such a leak ?<br /><br />Anyways, on the interesting things (for us) :<br /><br /><strong>1) Air Forteress (J)</strong><br /><br />It's interesting apparently they call $2006 &quot;vrad&quot; and $2007 &quot;vrdt&quot;, I guess for VRAM address and VRAM data.<br />You also see some pre-processor directives, like .ifn and .ife<br />A bit later you see that, very likely, $2000 is called CTLR0, and the variable where they store what they write to $2000 (which I usually call M2000 in my code) is called CR0.<br />Finally I must say the labels and comments are very weird. It almost looks like disassembled code sometimes. I sure doesn't wish to program like this, it would make the code extremely non-maintainable.<br /><br /><strong>2) Dragon's Lair (J) and (E)</strong><br /><br />Has probably the biggest piece of leftover code ever ! It's well known for being a pretty horrible NES game too, so we can have a good counter example about how NOT to code a game. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />We can see how the split their pointer tables into low and high componant, as we all (should) know it's more efficient this way. Apparently the assembler they used uses DL for what would be .db &lt;xxx and DH for .db &gt;xxxx<br /><br />Apparently they use '!' for local labels.<br /><br />They use hardwired addresses like $200 to setup their sprites, apparently they use a sprite zero hit. Shame on them  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />They use the word &quot;attribute&quot; so apparently attribute tables were actually called like this.<br /><br />Their temporary variables are called ZPAGE_BYTE[n] Doesn't sounds very friendly to code this way.<br /><br />Apparently they use macros for several kind of stuff, like ADD16<br /><br />Their banks were apparently programmed in reverse order as we can see here :<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; End of bank $39<br />; --- -- ---- ---<br />;======================================<br />; Start of bank $38<br />; ----- -- ---- ---<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ORG&nbsp; &nbsp;$138,$8000</div><br /><br />Apparently they were using MS-DOS, and the same PDS environment that was used for Ian Bell's tank demo as I can conclude from this :<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; End of bank $30/$31<br />; --- -- ---- -------<br />;======================================<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;IF&nbsp; &nbsp;EPROM=99<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;SEND COMPUTER1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ENDIF<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;IF&nbsp; &nbsp;EPROM=98<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;SEND MSDOS,&quot;C:\PDSMAST\DLAIRFCS\EPROM\DL.PDS&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ENDIF</div><br /><br /><strong>3) Robin Hood</strong><br /><br />Apprently they used .chr files <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />They used structure-like syntax with dots in their labels. This is really elegant in fact !<br /><br /><strong>4) Secret of Evermore</strong><br /><br />Okay it's not NES it's Super NES and there is nothing much interesting other than the game was written in C instead of assembly !<br /><br /><strong>5) Zig Zag Cat</strong><br /><br />Also Super NES, this time it's in assembly. Also it looks more like 6502 assembly than 65816 to me. They also use the ! for local labels, which means it's probably PDS too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sticking the source code is accidental, seemingly it was common for cross dev systems with disc drives. Guess they were allocating disc space for binary files without erasing it, without writing full content. I seen that even in an russian arcade game from 1980s, for an arcade machine.<br /><br />Funny that these days it happens with AVI files in torrent clients. They allocate disk space for the whole file, and if there used to be an erased video file on the same disk, when you trying to open the file that is not finished downloading yet, chances are that you'll see pieces of the erased video.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@thefox : You are totally right, it could have been the source of something else than the game itself !<br /><br />The only reason they would have to use floating point it :<br />1) The programmer is dumb and don't know about fixed point / they think floating point is the only way to represent non-integers, and trust me there are many people in this category<br />2) You have to handle both very small numbers such as 0.0001 and very large numbers like 10e+15 and both with a decent relative precision.<br /><br />In the case of hit calculations, it could probably be done in fixed point, especially considering the result is always from 0 to 999, which fits in 10-bits, therefore 6 bits are left for extra precision if required during the calculation of the damage.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Fixed point is fast but not convinient at all, it is pain in the back in a large complex project like a RPG game. There is nothing special or wrong in floating point usage, you know, many BASIC interpreters of old home computers had it as the only number type. Like, ZX Spectrum in 1982.<br /><br />I wonder how smart it is to tell that people who completed a huge successful project in 1990s were potentially dumb.

In an era where disk access may have been relatively slow, I could see how a ROM building tool wouldn't overwrite any data it didn't have to.<br /><br />These days... is it even possible to do anymore? It seems like that would be a big security risk for any OS to allow a file to be created that takes over a block of disk without clearing it first. You'd probably have to do it through low-level access. For PCs in the 80s and 90s I can understand why someone would favour speed over security in their I/O design.

We had a discussion about this recently on Slashdot, where the Mac OS team filled unused space in the Macintosh SE's ROM with three full-screen photos of the developers (G 41D89A from the debugger). A user joked that it would have been a better use of engineer's time to make a herculean effort to cut the program's footprint down to the next lower power of two.<br /><br />rainwarrior: It probably changed when PC operating systems started supporting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file" class="postlink">sparse files</a>, or files containing implicit zero-filled clusters.
