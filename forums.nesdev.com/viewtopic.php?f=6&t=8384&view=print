		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd like to say, before anyone gets the wrong idea. I have through the years since approximately 1999 thoroughly enjoyed NSF ripping without too many accolades. Although, don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed when others appreciated my work and many have.
<br />
<br />Although, NSF ripping to me has become more of a burden than anything else which is why I stopped ripping any NSFs since August. It got to the point where a good deal of them are really difficult and it just seemed more like a job. Especially so since I have people demanding NSFs from me and getting mad because I haven't provided for them or the NSF wasn't exactly what they expected or it wasn't complete. Also those few who were talking to me in the third person format as though I didn't exist and it was obvious for awhile that I was the only one doing it. Even though, one person had pointed out this fact. Even though it is a minor insult that I usually ignored. Occasionally, it would bother me.
<br />
<br />I spend a great deal of time ripping NSFs, some of them are easy enough to get within an hour or two and some of them require a great deal of time. Anywhere from 4-8 hours up to a month or two and some of them I worked off and on for several years. No kidding!
<br />
<br />I also spend a good deal of money to test these NSFs on the real thing, IE.. a front loading NES, NES PowerPak and several CF cards. I've spent over $300 on this project. Although, don't worry I ain't complaining about that. I really like my setup. But just saying I've spent money and lots more time which can be considered equal to money in some respect. Only to have people demanding and treating me like crap after all the effort.
<br />
<br />Now I'm done complaining. I hope no one minds.
<br />
<br />I also realize that everyone does a lot of work here with no thought of reward and I am the same way for the most part until lately. Although, until recently, I've always refused donations but now I'm really considering it. But not to worry, I'm not charging and never will for my effort. But if anyone thinks that the effort I have done is worth it, then please donate. Although, there is no obligation. But only do so after anyone is completely satisfied with the final version and NOT before the NSF is completely finished. The old same rule still applies as well, I can't rip every NSF and I would only know if I can until I start working on it and get it ripped.
<br />
<br />I have also read the Parodius Networking Policy which permits personal donations on this network which does host NESdev and it's forum. 
<br />
<br />I have also talked to a bunch of people about it and not one person has objected to accepting personal donations. Stating that they think it's right because of the time and effort involved.
<br />
<br />Although, before I actually do this. I would like some feedback about this subject. I wouldn't mind some compensation and at the same time I do not wish to offend anyone or this community. I love this place and I've been here for a long time.
<br />
<br />Thank you!
<br />
<br />Any questions are welcome as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />One thing I'd like to say is that you're basically asking for donations for ripping and distributing code that doesn't belong to you. I understand the work that it is, but that is something to think about.
<br />
<br />But, I wouldn't really be offended. I don't see too much problem with making money for doing work, if the copyright holders don't care. 
<br />
<br />All that said, I am not a hardcore archive buff. If a game has been dumped, it is archived. The nsf is an extra step for fans of the game, but I don't lose sleep on games that have been dumped but not nsf ripped. 
<br />
<br />I wouldn't personally donate much, because I haven't really used your services. My NSF collection contains exactly one NSF. I did <em>used to have</em> slightly more, maybe around ten? 
<br />
<br />Did you happen to rip Mother/Earthbound Zero in 2000? If so, I'd consider throwing a few bucks your way since that's the one nsf I do listen to.

<br />No, I did not rip Mother/Earthbound Zero. At the moment, I don't recall who did do it.

I'm sure you won't make a killing, but maybe you'd get enough to just spend a night out, that's the least the people who you brought all the NES game music they loved isn't a big deal at all. And he's not asking for it, people have offered it, and he's declined usually but is now thinking of maybe accepting them, I don't see how you think he's asking for them. If I ever get a paypal I'd gladly give you $10, one day I will, I listen to NSF's once in a while and would love to thank you for it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I would contribute.  Unfortunately I don't have a lot to spare, but I definitely understand how much work it can be to rip NSFs (because I did a bunch of them too).  Ones like Golgo 13 and Conflict were driving me nuts, and you managed to rip those (was you, right?).  And I don't even remember how many NSFs I tried to rip and failed, that you must have ripped successfully.  So I can definitely appreciate the work involved, because I sorta figured that I already got the low-hanging fruit many years ago.
<br />
<br />I'm sure I ran into some NSFs that were challenging, but doing a single Jereon Tel rip of Alien 3 I think was what made me finally say, "screw this!" - even though I ripped it successfully, that was enough madness for me.  So I did a few others after that, but not much.

<br />
<br />Oh yeah, I did rip Golgo 13 and Conflict. Those were difficult at the time since I was just learning. But now, they are somewhat easy if I ran into that kind of code again.
<br />
<br />I also ripped some from Jereon Tel. I know what you mean by how difficult they are to rip but I pretty much know how they all work and it isn't too bad once you know how. I also have a great deal of his source code now too, thanks to him.
<br />
<br />Thanks for saying you would contribute and you don't mind me asking here. You can if you like and if you do, don't worry about giving me a lot. If you don't that's ok too. There is no obligation. But of course I would appreciate it.
