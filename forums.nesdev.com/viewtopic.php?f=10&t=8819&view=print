		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, I guess this was discussed before, but search option did little help so...
<br />I'm in progress of creating a little game while I''m waiting for contents for other projects.
<br />...
<br />Probably it won't get finished as well, buuut....I want at least to ask a question.
<br />In <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watchv=UOfq1mbQzGs&amp;feature=youtu.be" class="postlink">this</a>video you can spot some artifacts.The bottom 2 (grey and green) squares are my fault, do not bother.What I want you to pay attention is the artifacts at right upper corner.At first look it looks like I simply screwed something, right? However, These artifacts are absent in the NameTable viewer in FceuX and Video Debug in Nintendulator!
<br />After a while I realized it may have to do something with Attribute table at $23C0, and I was right.The problem is basically solved, this happens because I set Y scroll to 0xF8-So all map can be seen in NTSC mode.
<br />So, why I'm writing this? I want to hear why, theoretically, happens.
<br />Screen resolution? 240 pixels of height means problems when you write value bigger than 240 into Vertical scroll.I'm thinking correctly or there's another reason?
<br />Thanks in advance. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />F0-FF are effectively negative y-scrolling values. However, the tiles that scroll on screen are actually the attribute table, getting (erroneously) interpreted as tiles.
<br />
<br />The actual explanation for why this happens has to do with how the internal counters and stuff inside the PPU all work together, but the basic idea is that 255 is an 8-bit number, but the height of a nametable is 240. When the tiles are being rendered, the PPU looks to see if it reached the 240th row of pixels in a nametable, and then swaps to the top of the next nametable if it did. However, if you start at or past the 240th row (i.e., your y-scroll is F0-FF), then it'll render row 240, 241, 242, etc..., 255, and then wrap back around to 0, without switching to the other nametable. Thus, it looks like a negative scroll value, and you get garbage at the top of the screen.
<br />
<br />I'm sure someone else here can explain it more clearly than what I just did, but none the less, that's what's happening. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

You can set the vertical scroll to $E8 instead of $F8, and instead of the artifacts you'll see the last row of the name table up there.

<br />That's because you use horizontal mirroring. Switch to vertical mirroring. That is, if you don't require the horizontal mirroring for anything else.

<br />Just curious:
<br />Hm...Is there a way around this to keep horizontal mirroring?
<br />Only way that comes to my mind is keeping Attribute Table clear(0x00) so artifacts won't appear.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The key to negative scrolling is that it does NOT advance from FF to 100, but rather FF to 00.  Same with 1FF advancing to 100 instead of 00.
<br />
<br />So if you are trying to intentionally show attribute tables, you may need to add 256 to the scroll value.
<br />
<br />Negative scrolling is normally something you don't want.  So calculate scrolling correctly so you don't encounter it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, keeping last 32 bytes of the attribute table cleared should fix the problem, but it will severely limit your use of background palettes in the bottom half of the screen.
<br />
<br />Another solution would be to disable background rendering for the first 8 scanlines, and only then turn it on. The difficult part is synchronizing with the PPU, something that's not so trivial when you don't have a scanline counter available.

The only lines you can count on being visible are 16 to 228. How big is your map?

<br />And game fits perfectly for emulators screens so it's okey for me.

<br />
<br />Just don't place crucial information too close to the edges (like a hole the player can fall into) and you'll be fine.
