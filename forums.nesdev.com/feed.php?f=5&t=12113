I never liked Eclipse for the reason being that <a href="http://www.vim.org/" class="postlink">Vim</a> serves my needs better then Eclipse will ever be. You see the problem with Eclipse is that it forces you to use your mouse when you are trying to type. When I want to type, I want my fingers to remain on the keyboard and close to home row preferably. Vim does that well. <br /><br />I prefer makefiles over silly projects and whatnot. The advantage of makefiles is it is clear to those who knows make what should happen and there is less uncertainty that projects will build on different systems in comparison to an IDE such as Eclipse. Also IDEs tend to use specific project formats which I understand why that is necessary but I nevertheless I do not like that. Lets say someone uses a (fictional) IDE called &quot;Eclipse on steroids&quot; and it creates a project file that is specific to it. I do not have &quot;Eclipse on steroids&quot; so I need to download it. Lets pretend the download is 10gb. That takes quite some time to download. Not everyone has an ultra fast connect. Although I will do other things while that is downloading it still wastes time that could have been dedicated to working on the project that created the need for the new IDE. People have different preferences and should not be forced to use one program. I have made it clear that I like Vim, but I know that is not true for all people. If someone wants to use a different text editor such as Emacs they like they should be able to do such so as long as it doesn't force me to use such software.<br /><br />Eclipse also starts up slow and even when running runs slow. I like being able to get started quickly.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5355">nintendo8</a> — Fri Jan 16, 2015 8:27 pm</p><hr />

I use eclipse pretty much every day for work. I use it primarily for Java development, and it fewer bugs than it used to. I haven't found a free IDE that works as well with Maven.<br /><br />For Python development I use PyCharm. It would be nice if it was able to pickup Python's dynamic nature, but it's great for being free (community version).<br /><br />I despise web development in all shapes/forms. Every time I have to do simple web pages with a back end it makes me sick. I can't imagine wanting to do that crap for a living, ugh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=45">drk421</a> — Thu Jan 01, 2015 10:16 pm</p><hr />

Well personally I hate how Eclipse is completely bloated and incredibly slow which is my 1st complaint, but I also am not comfortable with workspaces, which usually involves some multiple copies of your projects because you want to back up them, as Eclipse is so unstable you never know when a workspace will be &quot;corrupted&quot;. I also hate how you have to install multiple instances of it for different kinds of projects, each one taking 1GB of hard drive space, and how it adds a lot of random hidden files/folders everywhere on your PC even in folders that have barely any relationship with your projects.<br /><br />Since eclipse just calls other tools I think it's a better idea to use them directly. The only problem is that I'm not used to debug using the command line, this is not an easy thing to do, but I guess I'll have to learn, follow some tutorials and show my boss how it's much easier to work by avoiding Eclipse completely, even for debugging.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Dec 17, 2014 6:29 am</p><hr />

I've got a love/hate relationship with Eclipse IDE, though a bit more hate than love. I can't stand the workspace concept in Eclipse (with invisible files in directory), I tend to prefer much more IDEs with an file representing the project, like Code::Blocks or Visual Studio do. But then, these times I prefer not using IDEs at all and play with Vim.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=336">Jarhmander</a> — Mon Dec 15, 2014 10:19 pm</p><hr />
