		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm a gamer and all, and at first I didn't have anything against game collectors, because I trought it would just be cool to own lot of games.
<br />However, after I grew up as a NES homebrewer, I figured out that they rise and rise the price of old games (even common ones), and pass every mid-common game are very rare, just to sell them for a higher price. Also, they base the price of games on stupid elements (like selling Zelda carts more expensive because they're gold). Finally they love to buy lot of games they'll just stack up in a room and never use, exept to show off their collection, while those games could be either played (<em>especially</em> if they are rare), or be given to a serious NES homebrewer to use the carts for good use, like tracing some mapper stuff, recycle the PCB, etc... Aditionally, they always want games in perfect state with boxes and manuals to stack them up and eat dust, while on the other side I think manuals are usefull only if you actually use the game (well, for the box I guess it's okay for collection purpose).
<br />The worst of it is that they will sell their games that are scratched or in bad state to actual gamers (for a ridiculous high price) and keep their good games in good shape to eat dust.
<br />Finally, it's not uncommon to see the most rare NES PCBs like TNROM, SXROM or SUROM being attributed <em>only</em> to games that unfortunately gained too much repuation like Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy, and then this makes all these PCBs worth $100 instead of $3 (even trought the PCB themselves aren't so much different, just the game it belongs to).
<br />Finally, the collectors collects undumped games and wouldn't sell them for a reasonable price or even lend them to dumpers.
<br />
<br />EDIT : Without counting they often spead fake information about games, like they are absolutely sure and proud to know a wrong release date by heart, or they are sure that game XX was released only in japan for a particular reason wich is totally wrong, or they try to spread some knownledge about hardware stuff wich is comletely wrong (one of them once told me that the Final Fantasy games used special security circuit and that was why it wouldn't work on famiclones, wich is completely wrong, and he wouldn't trust me when I told him that the inside of FF1 or FF2 is the exact same as the inside of Zelda).
<br />
<br />So, does everyone here share my hate for game collectors, or it is just me who went crazy ?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't see any problem with people collecting games they actually play once in a while... What I find ridicullous is people that collect "rare" stuff just because it's worth a lot of money, to sell it in the future when it's worth even more money. What is ridiculous about it is that it becomes just a business, the games don't really matter, only their value...
<br />
<br />So, in reality, it doesn't matter if it's a NES game, a SNES game, an old comic book or even an old action figure in it's original packaging (that's a lot of nerdy stuff! O_o), as long as it's worth a lot of money, and that's just lame. If people like to trade games just for money, that's fine, but these so called "collectors" have no appreciation for the shit they collect, and are just making business.
<br />
<br />As for those who neither play/use or sell the stuff they collect, to me that looks like an obsessive disorder, where people feel the urge to have what others can't (or have a hard time to) get. Maybe this makes them feel superior somehow, for owning a lot of rare stuff few other people also own.

<br />So true. It's cool to have "one" rare game you play sometimes, but what the point of stacking 20 of similar carts, especially when they stack all the ones wich are boxed with manual and in good state, and sell the damaged/scratched ones or ones with dead battery or dirty connectors for a ridiculous price ! And FF definitely seems to be one of the best candidate for this kind of crap for some reason.
<br />
<br />I also like to get some good games either so that I can posess a part of my roms in legality (and this doesn't really matter for old games I think, since the money goes to the collectors to buy his cigarettes instead of going to Nintendo to produce new games). Also playing on the real hardware a game you liked and loved playing it only under emulation for years is something ! Finally, it's sometimes interesting to have the box and manual for the artwork inside it.
<br />
<br />Okay, what I'm especially refering to in this topic is that a guy opened a "vido game museum" several villages ahead of mine, and I tought it would be interesting. However, the guy and his "museum" really pissed me off instead. Not only his collection is not a museum at all (there is not a single pannel explaining anyhting, just stacks and stacks of games and consoles, some boxed, some not). He had 3 wholes stacks from floor to ceilings to NES, and 2 of SNES (what's the point ?). He has something similar to the Famicom Box running (and it's the only thing you can actually play). He also has some recent consoles running to play (so this is more like a video game shop than a museum). What really pisses me off his that he's smoking cigarettes in his own "museum" (actually this is his garage re-arranged), and he sells his extra copies of games (there is lot of them) most of them in quite poor state and loose for arround $20. And the press advertise for his stupid "museum"... (the only good thing is that you don't have to pay an entrance).

<br />Selfish? That sounds to me like you feel you're entitled to someone else's intellectual property. For most it would be perfectly moral for someone to own a game and not  publicly release it without being an asshole. I know for a fact that some don't horde prototypes just for monetary gain, one really good reason is so that OTHER people don't capitalize off their charity. I think the primary reason why people horde though is vanity which arguably isn't less immoral than envy.

<br />People keep using this phrase. I do not think it means what some people think it means. The different legal traditions lumped together using the blanket term "intellectual property" are more different from one another than similar to one another.

<br />
<br />Pretty much every serious collector I'm aware of has been pretty cool though.  They're usually aware that data on EPROMs have a limited life-span.  Everything gets dumped since there's trust-worthy people who'll do it.  There are some cases where a collector will get a game cart from a developer and be asked not to release copies of it.

<br />Personally, I'm still hoping SimCity will turn up eventually.  And Hard Drivin'.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Intellectual Property is something you have legal rights to. Your ROM dumped from the prototype cartridge does not make you the copyright holder of the game which it composes. Now, it's at your will if you want to distribute this copy you've made. It's for the good of the retro gaming community as a whole, though it might make your real PCB of the prototype sell for $700 on ebay instead of $1000 someday, I would consider that a small price to pay and getting it out to the public will give you a little fame anyway to compensate for it. I consider hoarding such a thing to be rather selfish. Again it's the other guy's choice but that's how I view it.
<br />
<br />Now, if they got it from someone who'd be in trouble if it were released, I'd see that as a very good reason. But I doubt this is the case most of the time, since these games are often 15-20+ years old.
