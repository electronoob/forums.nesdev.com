But information like what you just shared, I wish could be more seamlessly integrated into math courses. Instead its like an assembly line. Learn your formulas! Got 'em? Do a test! Failed? Oh well you have a good job 11 years later anyway

Complex analysis becomes a light leading out of the tunnel for this.</div><br />Oh I remember having studied this, and had to use the cubic formula, it was insanely complicated. Basically if I remember well solving arbitrary equation of 3rd and 4th order is possible but insanely complicated, and 5th order and upper is basically impossible without resorting to numerical approximations. Or you can be smart and factor the equation away by &quot;guessing&quot; solutions, but it's not always possible.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">That's what I thought. Who the hell says &quot;-5 meters above sea level&quot;?</div><br />Well, the sign simply shows the direcition. The same could be said about latitude and longitude positioning, the sign indicate the direction whether it's north/south or east/west. Basically it carries extra information in the numebr itself. Complex numbers is the same concept, they carry information for a number and an angle at the same time.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It is not the square root of -1, but rather it is the &quot;imaginary&quot; number that when squared will equal -1. i2 = -1<br /></div><br />Actually every (positive real) number has two &quot;square roots&quot; (i.e. two reals that multiplied by themselves gives this result) but the &quot;square root&quot; function only returns the positive one. For example both 3 and -3 will give 9 when multiplied with themselves, but only 3 is the square root of 9, not -3.<br /><br />Similarly, both i and -i gives -1 when multipplied by themselves. Since neither is &quot;positive&quot; nor &quot;negative&quot; (they are something else entierely !) we can't decide which one is the &quot;square root&quot; of -1. We could decide that we keep the one in the first hemicycle (angle is smaller than 180°), this is simple when having the square root of negative numbers (the two &quot;roots&quot; will always be conjugated), but when taking the square root of an already complex number there is no simple solution (the two &quot;roots&quot; can be anything if I'm not mistaken).

In that game, the levels during game play are called DEPTH xxx m when you're under ground and will be called HEIGHT xxx m when you're above ground in the full game. I think it's kind of weird it switches from DEPTH x during game play to HEIGHT -x on the game over screen, but I guess it makes it easier to compare progress with other people at a glance. (The instructions encourage you to take a picture of this progress screen to share with others.)
