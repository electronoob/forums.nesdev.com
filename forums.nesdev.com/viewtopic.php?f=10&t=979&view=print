		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well.. I was feeling pretty good because recently I've made NROM, CNROM, and UNROM devcarts.
<br />
<br />However, my ultimate goal (which shouldn't be that hard) is to make a mapper 4 cart so I can put the IPS-patched SMB2J rom on it.
<br />
<br />Here is the info from the EEPROM pinout conversion guide by Drk on the main  page:
<br />
<br /><em>TKROM &amp; TSROM (mapper 4):<br />PRG socket:<br />Bend up pins 1, 2, 24, 30 and 31 (or cut tracks 2, 24, 30 and 31)<br />Solder pin 2 to hole 24 (A16)<br />Solder pin 24 to GND (OE)<br />Solder pin 30 to hole 1 (A17)<br />Solder pin 31 to hole 2 (A18)<br />CHR socket:<br />Bend up pins 1, 2, 22, 24, 30, 31 (or cut tracks 2, 22, 24 and 30)<br />Solder pin 2 to hole 24 (A16)<br />Solder pin 22 to hole 31 (CE or CHR /A13)<br />Solder pin 24 to hole 2 (OE or CHR /RD)<br />Solder pin 30 to hole 1 (A17)</em>
<br />
<br />I decided to cut the tracks, since I was using sockets. Since I cut the tracks, I soldered the sockets in without bending up pins. Was that the right thing to do? Because if so, on the PRG for example - if I solder pin 2 to hole 24, and then hole 2 to pin 31.. then in reality pin 31 is connected to 2 AND 24 - and that can't be right, can it? With the pins thru the holes, I can't distinguish from connecting holes / pins - but does that even matter if the traces are cut?
<br />
<br />I burnt the EEPROMS and placed them in. After retrying a million times, I can get it to boot - and play. The sound is fine, but the graphics are scrambled.
<br />
<br />Any help would be appreciated.
<br />

I thing drk's doccuments were correct, tough. Just compare NES chip pinout with your EPROMs pinouts.[/url]

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the reply, the following is from your document:
<br />
<br /><em>- Be sure to know where you will found wire-pont for old signals that has been cutted that needs to be rewired. That should be done BEFORE solvering the news rom, else you won't be able to see tracks on the top of the PCB !! If you found no solver pad, scratch the PCB with any tool to have the copper directly available, then solver your wire on the copper</em>
<br />
<br />I think I see where I made my mistake - I didn't bother to wire the points to the solder pads, so I ended up with double solder points on certain pins, like this:
<br />
<br /><em>CHR socket:<br />Solder pin 2 to hole 24 (A16)<br />Solder pin 24 to hole 2 (OE or CHR /RD)<br /></em>
<br />
<br />So.. if I understand you right, I should be pin 2 to the cut trace of hole 24, and pin 24 to the cut trace of pin 2.
<br />
<br />If anyone could verify this before I try it again - that would help.
<br />
<br />Thanks!

<br />
<br />Bregalad, thanks to your doc I figured out my big mistake - soldering the wires to the correct solder pads after cutting traces.
<br />
<br />Thanks again.
