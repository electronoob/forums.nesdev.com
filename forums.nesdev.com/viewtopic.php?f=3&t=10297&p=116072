						<div class="postbody">Hello there guys, I'm a new member to this site, and I'm also pretty new to the emulation scene. The NES is going to be my first console emulator, and I hope you can help me with my problems. <br /><br />I'm already mostly done with the CPU, and it works well, cycles seem accurate up until now, and it just seems to function like it should. My problem now is the PPU. I'm stuck with all the graphics stuff. After having read up on name tables, pattern tables, attribute tables, palettes, sprites, etc, I'm wondering, where on an ROM/cartridge is all this stuff located? Now, I know the generic answer would be: &quot;in the CHR memory banks&quot;, but here's the problem: How do I figure out which thing to find where? Where are the pattern tables located? Where are the name tables located? The PPU seems to have access to 16KB memory, which mostly contains graphics-related stuff, but I don't know how to find the location/memory area of these things. <br /><br />What confuses me is that games don't have a fixed amount of CHR banks, and some have none at all. Imagine if a game has only 1 CHR memory bank of 8KB, that wouldn't fit all these things, would it? And what if a game doesn't have any CHR banks? How do I figure out where all the tables/palettes are located? Can someone give me a breakdown of how to figure these things out? I'm assuming the answer is pretty simple, but I just can't seem to figure it out.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

It will take care of putting everything where it needs to be. All you have to do is render the frame according to the rules of the PPU. For rudimentary PPU support, you can once per frame (like, at the end of VBlank) read it all and generate a picture: use the scroll values to know what part of the name tables to use, then get the tiles indicated there, apply the attribute bits from the attribute tables and look up the final colors in the palettes. After that, you can read the OAM and overlay sprites. This will get the simplest games working, but to actually simulate a NES you'll have to run the PPU in parallel with the CPU (vs. rendering the whole frame at once).</div>

This is the thing I don't get: the PPU memory map shows the from $2000 to $2400, name table 0 and attribute table 0 can be found. Where is this $2000 to $2400? As far as I was concerned, the PPU only had 2KB internal memory. This #$400 of space is on the cartridge, right? So when I instruct the PPU to get name table 0 from $2000 in the emulated memory space, how would I let my program &quot;know&quot; where this $2000 starts? As an emulated memory space I'd have an array of bytes of size #$4000 or so (off the top of my head), but nothing is ever written to memory address $2000 and beyond. I only know that I can extract an 8KB pattern table from the CHR bank of the ROM and push it into memory, but other than that I know nothing. <br /><br />Sorry for the confusion and possibly stupid questions. I started a couple of months ago with absolutely 0 knowledge of processors, graphical processing units and memory management of any kind. This is all a bat to the face for me (:</div>

There is enough address space for four nametables, each 1 KiB ($400 bytes) in size, but CIRAM (the video memory in the NES Control Deck) can hold only two. It brings CIRAM A10 out to the cart edge, and the Game Pak PCB usually connects it to PPU A10 or PPU A11.<br /><br /><ul><li>If CIRAM A10 = PPU A11, then CIRAM $000-$3FF is mapped to $2000-$23FF and $2400-$27FF, and CIRAM $400-$7FF is mapped to PPU $2800-$2BFF and $2C00-$2FFF. This produces vertical arrangement or horizontal mirroring and is used by <em>Ice Climber</em>. </li><li>If CIRAM A10 = PPU A10, then CIRAM $000-$3FF is mapped to $2000-$23FF and $2800-$2BFF, and CIRAM $400-$7FF is mapped to PPU $2400-$27FF and $2C00-$2FFF. This produces horizontal arrangement or vertical mirroring and is used by <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> </li><li>Some mappers, or support chips on the Game Pak PCB, allow CIRAM A10 to be turned on or off. When it's turned off, CIRAM $000-$3FF is mapped to all four nametables; when it's turned on, CIRAM $400-$7FF is mapped to all four nametables. This produces one-screen mirroring and is most commonly seen in games developed by Rare. </li><li>Some mappers have switchable mirroring, which allows the program to choose from some all of the above methods. </li></ul><br />Which <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Mirroring" class="postlink">mirroring type</a> is used depends on in which directions a game scrolls, how far, and whether the game includes a status bar.</div>

Where the data actually comes from doesn't matter at all... the game is free to do all kinds of processing on the data before uploading it to VRAM, but this is a problem for the game's engine, not you.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Does the game do it through the CPU, or can it directly write to the PPU?</div><br />Like we've pointed out already, the program doesn't have direct access to VRAM, the CPU and the PPU have their individual addressing spaces, completely independent of each other. The CPU/game can only communicate with the PPU through the registers mapped at $2000-$2007. To write data to VRAM, the program has to go like &quot;Hey PPU, please point to address $2400 of VRAM for me, and then store #45 in this location, please&quot;. The CPU has to &quot;ask&quot; the PPU to load/store data from/to VRAM, it can't go barging in and access the memory itself. Read more about the PPU registers in the wiki and you'll eventually get it.<br /><br />What you have to do now is implement the PPU's memory map, just like you have done for the CPU. Once the memory is there and the game has access to it through the PPU ports, you can go about implementing a rendering system, which will use the data from VRAM to generate a picture. Like I said, at this early stage, it would be better if you rendered the whole picture at once, so you can better understand how everything comes together to form an image. However, that's not how the NES works... the PPU and CPU run in parallel, and at the same time the game is running in the CPU, the PPU is rendering the picture. It's important to emulate them running side by side because games can make changes to PPU registers and to VRAM in the middle of the frame, and these changes affect how the picture looks. If you keep rendering a whole picture at once, you won't catch these changes. But don't worry about that now.<br /><br />BTW, when I say &quot;VRAM&quot; I mean the PPU memory, even though some of it is not RAM if the cart uses CHR-ROM. So, by &quot;VRAM&quot; I basically mean pattern tables + name tables + attribute tables + palettes. Sprites are not included in that pack, since OAM is not mapped to the same addressing space. The OAM has its own 256-byte addressing space, which can be accessed through registers $2003/$2004 (although that method of access has been recently found to be buggy, and should be avoided in favor of OAM DMA, which 100% of the commercial games use), much like VRAM is accessed through $2006/$2007.</div>

						<div class="postbody">After reading this post I still have a few questions:<br /><br />1. So I only need to load the pattern tables from CHR-ROM and the rest of the tables will be filled up by the program code (I assume by writing values to $2006?)?  I'm still a bit fuzzy on how the attribute and nametables are filled.  <br />2. Where exactly is the CHR data located inside of the ROM file?  I know that PRG data starts after the iNes header, but what address does the CHR data start and end at?<br />3. How do I go about rendering one image at a time instead of running the PPU in parallel with the CPU?  Do I just run the CPU until enough cycles have passed for one frame to be drawn and then have the PPU draw the frame from the data in VRAM at that moment?  Won't the PPU miss changes to it's registers since it will only be checking them once per frame?</div>

So I only need to load the pattern tables from CHR-ROM<br /></div> Assuming the game only has 8 KiB CHR-ROM, yes.

I'm still a bit fuzzy on how the attribute and nametables are filled.<br /></div> The program in PRG writes specific values to $2006 and $2007 <br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">2. Where exactly is the CHR data located inside of the ROM file?  I know that PRG data starts after the iNes header, but what address does the CHR data start and end at?<br /></div> Specifically in the case of iNES or NES2.0: CHR starts at 16+16384*PRGSIZE and is 8192*CHRSIZE long.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">3. How do I go about rendering one image at a time instead of running the PPU in parallel with the CPU?<br /></div> There are a whole slew of sophisticated techniques to manage this (Catch-up, prediction, rewinding). Given that you sound like you're on really shaky footing right now, though, I'd strongly recommend doing the simplest thing that could possibly work, and just rendering 3·N pixels to the pixel buffer after each CPU instruction completes (that took N cycles)<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> Do I just run the CPU until enough cycles have passed for one frame to be drawn and then have the PPU draw the frame from the data in VRAM at that moment?<br /></div> That will only work on the simplest of games.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Won't the PPU miss changes to it's registers since it will only be checking them once per frame?<br /></div> Also, the PPU will change some things during rendering, and if you emulate that way, the CPU won't notice.</div>
