		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There is quite literally <em>no way</em> for an external peripheral connected to the expansion port to put bits in the correct place to be read as player 1 by the CPU.<br /><br />The Famicom expansion port connector provides access <em>only</em> to player 2 ([$4017]&amp;1), player 4 ([$4017]&amp;2), three other pins used for other expansion port devices ([$4017]&amp;$1C), and player 3 ([$4016]&amp;2). There is no connection to player 1 ([$4016]&amp;1).<br /><br />Software could be written to read the extra controllers off one of the available pins that <em>are</em> there, but that requires a software intervention, not a hardware one.

The only non-Technos game on the list was Wit's, but it also appears to only read bits 0/1.<br /><br />So... no, the Hori adapter should not work as it claims, to the best of my knowledge.
