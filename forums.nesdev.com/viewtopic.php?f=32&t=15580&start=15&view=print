I really enjoyed interpreting your characters into the modern arcade / realistic setting chosen for the illustration.<br /><br />Lala, for example, shows references to her cutscene sprite through a dark sleeveless top, tall dark boots and long, purple, curly hair -- and her in-game cutscene with the magenta drawstring hoodie (for her robe) and witch's hat (on the floor). The star earring is a reference to her magic wand, and the rest (baby tee, hand-stitched black jeans, scruncie, choker, and highlights) were all added to strengthen the mall-teen aesthetic for the type of girl that'd wear a witch's hat in public. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Haven't finished flats, but have started some shading (Cheril and a bit elsewhere) to get a feel for the final light / dark balance.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had trouble finding 240p Test Suite in the first version. But now after looking up the hangul on the marquees, I realized 240p Test Suite is plugged into the Sinking Feeling machine's JAMMA slot as a diagnostic.<br /><br />Speaking of &quot;Sinking Feel-Ling&quot; (싱킹필링) on the marquee: I'm not familiar with the conventions for hangulization of English, but I do know hangul for Korean tries to be morphophonemic in that a suffix beginning with a vowel is often moved to its own cluster beginning with a syllable break (ᄋ). Is there a reason the ᆯ (L) is doubled?<br /><br />There are two lines of hangul on the marquee of what appears to be a claw machine (nearest the restroom). The top line says NESdev, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw_crane" class="postlink">English Wikipedia's article about claw machines</a> doesn't appear to link to a Korean article about the same thing.<br /><br />Another question I have relates to how this illustration is supposed to fit on the packaging and cartridge label with the title and stuff. I ask because that might affect whether there'd be a place for a &quot;B-side&quot; where Gus from 240p Test Suite is repairing a game after hours.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry for the late reply. Wanted to finish coloring the crane game to post with it:<br /><br /><img src="http://files.mteegfx.com/a53v3_010.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />You're right: &quot;네스데브&quot; is NesDev<br />Below it is &quot;<a href="https://namu.wiki/w/%EB%BD%91%EA%B8%B0%EA%B8%B0%EA%B3%84" class="postlink">인형뽑기</a>&quot;, which is what claw games are most commonly referred to as (loosely translates to doll pull or doll pulling machine). Here's a <a href="http://blog.naver.com/PostView.nhn?blogId=nb1043&amp;logNo=220801797329&amp;redirect=Dlog&amp;widgetTypeCall=true" class="postlink">blogpost</a> with an image of a shop that uses it in their signpost for reference.<br /><br />The double rieul (ㄹ) in 싱킹필링 is there because it's common practice when writing out foreign words in Korean to double that character for an &quot;l&quot; sound in the middle of word, when a single instance would be used for an &quot;r&quot;. (This is not entirely consistent, but is a solid guideline. Spelling of foreign words into Korean can vary quite a bit as well.) Spelling out English titles for media instead of translating them is the most common approach, at least since the 90s. I had initially considered translating the title, but in doing so, it could mistakenly bring up connotations with a high profile ferry sinking incident from a few years back.<br /><br />Anyway, glad to explain anything asked. Hope the Korean isn't an issue. I felt it'd add a little visual interest to the setting while also removing any unwanted emphasis put on titles whose marquees would be visible. Especially with the coloring, for the average consumer, the in-illustration text should merely add to the background, not stand out from it at all.<br /><br />It's late now, I have the layout for box and label, including logo and title pretty concrete in sketch form. I'd rather just wait until they're done to post them, but I'm pushing back another project already to make time to finish this, so definitely no time for &quot;B-sides&quot; versions of the illustrations. Sorry. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Luckily, I hadn't inked that portion and was able to relegate Calavera to the prize shelf.
