<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/*INSTR ARGS OPCODE BYTES MOD CLASS SHIFT OR */<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;DSP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*,*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;02&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;COMBINE&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br /></div><br /><br />he used it like:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">DSP $00,$3F<br /></div><br />I guess what he is doing is setting voice0 left volume<br />but according to docs I've found you should do something like that in this way:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">mov $F2, $00&nbsp; ; Set DSP register to voice0 left volume<br />mov $F3, $3F&nbsp; ; Set DSP data to $3F<br /></div>
<br />
<br />or have I understood it all wrong?

<br />is it a bug in wla-spc700 or is there no bne instruction?

<br />I think the reason I got it was b/c it was a hardcoded adress and not a label.. but shouldn't wla-spc700 support that?

<br />Also, there is EI and DI, that probably stand for Enable Interrupts and Disable Interrupts, but I don't know what could trigger an interrupt nor where it would jump if an interrupt would be triggered.
<br />
<br />About Wla-DX, there is the WLA message board, I reccomand to post all your problems here. I have been in trouble with WLA-6502, because 16-bit stx and sty didn't work, I put my complain, and the guy eventually respond me and fixed it (if no anwer come immediately, don't worry).

<br />I can't get it do what I want it to do.. so I have to come up with ugly hacks all the time.. and this bank/slot thing makes my brain explode ;D
<br />
<br />as an example.. I want to put some data at an specific adress (like $0300) unfortantly there is no way to tell the assembler to put it at that specific adress.. so I have to create padding files that I .INCBIN =/ maybe I could use the repeat macro in some way.. but I don't fully understand everything in the assembler yet =/

I think you could reserve a piece of RAM (for example $300-$fff) for code, and the rest for Sample pointer data, music data, possible sound effect data and sample data (this is probably the biggest one).
<br />I think you may do it as if $300-$fff would be ROM.
<br />So, the definition are :
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.memorymap<br />defaultslot 0<br />slotsize $f0<br />slot 0 $0&nbsp; &nbsp;;0 page RAM &#40;$f0-$ff should be safe !&#41;<br />slotsize $100<br />slot 1 $200 ;Other variable may come at $200-$2ff before the code<br />slotsize $d00<br />slot 2 $300 ;Code goes here<br />slotsize $400<br />slot 3 $1000 ;Sample pointer data<br />slotsize $c00<br />slot 4 $1400 ;Music data<br />slotsize $e000<br />slot 5 $2000 ;Sample data<br />.endme<br />.rombankmap<br />bankstotal 1<br />banksize $d00<br />banks 1<br />.endro<br /></div><br />Then, imput all your code into secrions (either FREE, or FORCE), and imput the following :<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.section &quot;Volume&quot; SLOT 2<br />... code for your volume goes here<br />.ends<br /></div>
<br />This *should* work. Else, try asking to WLA-DX forums.
<br />
<br />By the way, could I ask what are you doing at the momment with the SPC-700 ? I always gets exited with this chip, because of all the good music that the SNES games have. I'm hopefully to write SNES code once only for the sound, hehe.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />well.. for the moment I'm just experementing to get to know the SNES APU.. I do this by assembling it into a spc file that I playback on spc tool (for debuging). later on when I feel like I know what I'm doing I'm going to write my own sfx/music engine for the snes <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />the only problem with having as a spc file instead of making a snes rom of it is that you can't do all the nice stuff like copying new samples the the spc memory and other things..
<br />
<br />but I can tell you that I got supprised of how easy it seems to be coding for the spc-700, I had never touched it before because all docs I found explained it in such a weird way that I couldn't really get what you were suppose to do.
<br />
<br />I will release the source for what I'm working on later on when I get it to actually make some noise <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Then you'll probably have to make some sample data transfer routines where both the SNES CPU and the SPC-700 would comunicate to copy samples from the SNES ROM to the SPC-700 RAM.
<br />Some games does use only one set of samples (Zelda3, CastleVania 4, Breath of Fire, etc...) but the quality will become mediocre then, instead of using variable sample data (Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger, etc...)
<br />I think you would need to do it manually while dealing only with SPC files, while this could be done by transfer code later.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />the DSP instruction isn't really a instruction as I discoverd but a command for the MSS engine.. he had added a special instruction that his engine translated in to real code.. example:
<br />
<br />he sends to the APU through the I/O ports on the SNES
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">DSP $00, $3F</div><br /><br />and that got translated to something like:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">$06, $00, $3F</div><br /><br />that was put into the different I/O ports and transferd to the APU where his engine would use it like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">SCPU:<br />...<br />mov IOport0, #$06<br />mov IOport1, #$00<br />mov IOport2, #$3F<br />...<br /><br />----------------------<br />APU:<br />...<br />cmp IOport0, #$06<br />beq SetDSP<br />...<br /><br />SetDSP:<br />mov $F2, IOport1<br />mov $F3, IOport2<br />ret<br /></div>
<br />
<br />and about the other commands.. sorry havn't read up on those
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />that's just one way it's used.. the other one is that he tells the engine to jump to that specific code on the apu to for example init the apu.
<br />
<br />sorry if I'm not good at explaining.. it's much easier to understand if you watch his code...

<br />
<br />If you wan't to just test various samples, try to get anything using BRR mode 2, then overflow the data (so the decoded wav data will override from $ffff or underride from $0000, if you see what I mean), then loop this sample. This usually results in an interessting "noisy" sample, that is much shorter and more accurate than recording/encoding a real noise sound, and much more fun than use the SPC's noise generator (that can outpout only one frequency for all channels). I always found these noise samples very interesting and fun. ZSNES emulates them very badly, the last SNES9x seems to emulate them wrong but not that bad, and SnesAmp (Win-amp plug-in) seems to emulate them just like the real hardware does. Chrono Trigger is a good game to test this, it's sound effect's samples 4, 6, 7 and 8 are all different "noise samples", they all sound the same under ZSNES, but they actually are different, and the sound effects won't sound as good that the real game under an emulator.
<br />Well, I'm passioned a lot by this feature of the SPC 700.

<br />I've tested it on my PAL SNES using a Super Wildcard DX2. So hopefully this should work <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I know that there is lots of weird things in there.. but that is mostly b/c I don't fully understand wla dx yet.
<br />and if you like the spc700.inc file I created feel free to use it in you're own projects
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />noticed a typo in the snes part when setting start adress for the spc.. strangely it still worked.. but anyway.. a corrected version is up now (still the same URL)
