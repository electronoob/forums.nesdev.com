Probably something like $35 or so for the first board and then discounting on the more you order. I believe 200 boards would be around $2 each, but you'll never use that many. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Mon Jan 16, 2012 8:54 pm</p><hr />

Would it be difficult to just order from a company pcb boards so I wouldn't have to solder wires? How much do you think it would cost? I know plans have to be drawn up. I would be willing to buy the boards, if some body would draw the diagram and I would just give some boards to them.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5135">ptrckcrw2</a> — Mon Jan 16, 2012 8:29 pm</p><hr />

If you want to do it right get yourself a Weller soldering iron with adjustable temperature setting.  It'll cost quite a bit more than others but it'll last forever and meet any needs you have.  I use one everyday and constantly adjust the temperature setting.  Mine goes from 350-850F but I'm always between 500-700.  I do very similar soldering work and made a few carts myself and I wouldn't want to be working at 800F personally, nor can I imagine you'd want to be for this type of work.  Something like a WESD51, it'll run ya $200 or more.  But if you're serious about this it's worth every penny.<br /><br />They little $20 or less de-soldering irons from radioshack with the red bulb are great.<br /><br />I also can't imagine not having a multimeter.  No offense but if you're the type of person that doesn't own a multimeter this is going to be a challenge for you.  Yes you could get by without one, but good luck finding out what's wrong without it, you'll be in the dark.  Or even having it to check for shorts from Vcc to GND.  Make this mistake one time and you'll need to replace your NES.  You can get one that'll work for less than $10.<br /><br />As for size of EPROMS buy the ones that you need for what you're making or larger.  There isn't one answer for this question.  These are the types of things you'll need to research and learn up about.<br /><br />22ga or larger seems pretty big too me.  I wouldn't want to deal with anything larger than 24ga personally.  I use 28ga and would recommend something from 24-28ga.  I do use 30ga occasionally but I would say it's a little small for this task.  And I like to use a flux pen I picked up off Digikey, just make sure you use flux of some sort (the stuff in the solder doesn't count).<br /><br />Also if you're using EPROMS you'll probably want an eraser.  And I would recommend a cartridge dumper or some sort to help troubleshoot problems when they arrise.  <br /><br />What kind of mold capabilities do you have with your vacuum molds?  Are you able to make cartridge plastics? Do you have any links or pictures of past projects with your moldings? Because that is something that could be useful around here.  <br /><br />I'm also curious about these table top arcades you're making.  I'm kind of confused on how this kit idea is supposed to work by modifying the NES/Gameboy, especially when you're asking these basic questions...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Thu Dec 29, 2011 3:19 pm</p><hr />

You'll need a desoldering iron, solder with flux, some extra flux anyway, and then I'd get one about 800ish degrees, in the middle seems the best. When melting lots of solder like on the RF or AC adapter joints you don't want to wait forever. And get a plug-in one. And a sponge to clean your tip on and also maybe 1-2 extra tips just in case.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Thu Dec 29, 2011 1:39 pm</p><hr />
