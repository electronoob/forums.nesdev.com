<br />I have been a Final Fantasy fan and a NES fan for a long time arround, but I didn't "really" play Final Fantasy II until somewhat recently (I made my own cartridge, then the saves didn't least, I fixed it and now it's fixed so I eventually got myself into playing it). Until very recently I was pretty convincted that this was a good game, or at least a decent one, but just now I've tried really hard to progress in the game (without success) I'm really lohating the game. It's battle system is HORRIBLE ! Not only this game is bad but it is also vicious, some games such as Heroes of the Lance looks really bad from the start, but FF2 tricks the played into looking like a good game for the first few hours of gameplay, only to ruin and frustrate the player later.
<br />
<br />This is in fact probably the worst game ever made for the best console ever made, if you see what I mean. Did anyone here managed to beat this ?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's really hard to describe, just that the enemies keep doing your party 0 damage all the way arround, until you meet strongers monsters who will poison and blind your characters, and deal them great dammage. Since the only way to get more HP is to take damage, and that monsters will do either ridiculously low dammage or ridiculously high dammage, it's really hard to get more HP and survive. A technique is to attack yourself, it works pretty much but this isn't enough to fix the terrible mecanics of the game. The dungeons are terribly long, confusing and you get attacked too often. Later in the game each single monster will have 50% of doing either paralisys, blind, poison, or even frog, wich is horrible as you can carry only 32 items (which includes about 10 key items that you cannot discard) and only have the esuna spell very late in the game. Unless you can be strong enough to either dodge everything or to go through the whole long and tedious dungeon with all status aliments of the game at the same time, you're going to have a really frustating time.
<br />FF2 is more a time waster and something to get you mad than something to get you entertained. Now I get a save file with all characters maxed out with best weapons and airship from the start, so that I did in 2 hours more than what I did in probably more than 15 hours, and that without getting frustrated. Emulators allows you to frameskip too, and this is needed because FF2 is SLOW, especially on a PAL system (FF1 is too, but it has a decent fighting system and good dungeons).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Highly recommanded, if you can found valid GG codes arround. I just beat the game with an insane ammount of cheating and the story isn't even that woth the pain (about 5 hours of gameplay), but it sure it NOT worth the pain to go thorough without cheating (about 50 hours of tedious leveling and do dungeons again, again and again loosing each time). I guess I'm going to reprogramm my SNROM cart with something better on it. Sad I've hard-soldered my EPROM because I couldn't remove the metal bar on the NES; and because I didn't exept the game to be this bad. My EPROM chip is probably lost, unless I can reprogramm it in-circuit, which I doubt because the MMC1 won't like 12V supply (and will conflict with lines from the programmer), but an EPROM is not that expensive, oh well.
<br />
<br />The real cartrige isn't worth one penny, exept to burn it maybe. If you want to play FF2 at all cheat all the way along and even here it's not worth for the characters who each one has one small line to say once in a long while.

I never beat the game because I was using save-states, I saved while walking on the map just before an unavoidable and impossible random battle which completely doomed me (I never saved normally, even once).
<br />
<br />Also for a Zelda 2 game genie code, trying using SSSSSS.  It's major cheating but it's kinda funny.

<br />What was tard about Zelda 2's experience system?  
<br />
<br />That game totally gets burned by people when it's actually pretty good.  I think people would've liked it more if it wasn't a Zelda game... but when you compare it to games inside its own genre (like, say, Battle of Olympus) -- it stands above just about all of them.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, Battle of Olympus was boring and give you the sensation of being lost right from the start, so was Fanaxadu, and Castlevania II is fun but incredibly glitchy, impossible to beat withotu a walktrough and very easy to beat with a walktrough. I never played Zelda II (nor any Zelda game) more than about 20 minues without being seriously bored either. I guess this doomed the "platform-RPG" genre because I haven't seen any more recent games in this cathegory, altrough I guess the cathegory has its potential it just didn't get any really good games on the NES.
<br />
<br />And nothing beats the crappy non-experence system of FF2. Oh, well, the lifebar who start almost empty after you lost once of Metroid was also pretty terrible.

<br />I'd think that recent 2D Castlevanias (Dawn of Sorrow and Portrait of Ruin) could be considered "platform-RPG" games...

<br />At least Aria of Sorrow on GBA, which is the only recent castlevania game I have, can, and it's actually pretty good. At least way better than all NES platform-RPG games I've played, and uncomparably better than Castlevania II.
<br />
<br />And I've recently played FF1 again just a little, it's atsouning to see how better than FF2 it is !! It plays better, looks better, overall feels better. It's amazing to think FF2 is the sequel to FF1 and that it's not the other way arroud.

Probably much like the real Super Mario Bros 2 they felt that they hadn't done a sufficient job and instead of soiling their good name, they took the short term financial hit and waited until they made a better game.
