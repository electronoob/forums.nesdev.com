I will be adding PCB pics of my carts as soon as I get a decent camera to do so. I want to have profiles for each board type as well, with pictures and info like kevtris has in his mapper database.<br /><br />As for the posts about allowing anyone to contribute: Anyone with a CopyNES can contribute. I originally allowed contributions from anyone by allowing them to load a ROM rather than download from a CopyNES, as at the time I didn't even have one yet. But once I had one, this came back and bit me in the ass because some ROMs I had used turned out to be bad and whatnot. So I scrapped that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=158">BootGod</a> — Sun Sep 10, 2006 10:01 am</p><hr />

I think Japanese games are espacially important, since the NES and basically all its games are from Japan.<br /><br />EDIT : What are people supposed to do when they forgot their passwords ? Looks like I've mistaped mine, and it won't come up with any variation of it that I tried.
