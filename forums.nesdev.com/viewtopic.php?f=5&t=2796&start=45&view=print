<br />Well, think I'm not the only one to think that. For me FM was basically a technique from radios to converts modulated waves into usable sound, and I don't understand this. All I can tell is that Genesis music sounds awfull for my viewpoint.

<br />Yeah I'm sure you're right.  I just look at the FDS's sound channel and imagine how they could have a 8+ channels of a more modernized version of that same concept --- it would just be <em>so</em> much nicer.
<br />
<br />Sure FM was a step up from straight fixed-form sound channels on the NES (basic pulse, triangle, etc), but I honestly think it was a step backwards from what things like the FDS were heading towards.
<br />
<br />Thank heavens the SNES didn't take the FM route.

<br />Oh you did NOT JUST GO THERE &gt;=/
<br />
<br />Seriously, though, the main reason people beat on FM synth so much is not because it's actually bad, but because most of the music on systems that use it uses it quite lazily. Especially when it tries too hard to reproduce real instruments rather than trying just to sound nice. If you look at some of the better Genesis games, some of the mid-90s commercial PC titles like <em>Descent,</em> and <em>Lagrange Point,</em> it can actually be quite good. (I admit that <em>Lagrange Point</em>'s is not quite as good, but that's more due to the severely limited nature of that particular chip than the nature of FM in general.)
<br />
<br />I guess my main point is that the quality of the music has much, MUCH more to do with the time and effort put into it than it has to do with the nature of the sound hardware. Even higher-end wavetable chips like the SPC can still sound like crap in the hands of a lazy musician (I'm looking at YOU, <em>Super Ghosts 'N Goblins,</em>) and even limited-technique hardware like FM chips can sound quite nice when some thought and effort is put into it (hooray for <em>Zero Wing,</em> eh?)
<br />
<br />P.S. The FDS sound channel also incorporated simple FM =P

<br />
<br />Konami also did a piss-poor job when making FM music for Lagrange Point.  I find the music just boring and lifeless.  The simple OPL chip inside the VRC7 isn't at fault -- just listen to "Illusion City" on the MSX or some old Adlib (?) demo music to hear great FM music from similar instruments.
<br />
<br />I guess I still like FM synth music a lot because a) a lot of great arcade games during the '80s had some fantastic and memorable FM music, and b) a lot of 70s rock &amp; progressive musicians used similar FM syths.  They've got a warm feeling to them.
<br />
<br />Anyway, Yuzo Koshiro's been mentioned to death.  Please go and check out Hitoshi Sakimoto's Megadrive compositions (like Gauntlet IV, Midnight Resistance, and Verytex) for another master of the more typical (ie, not dance-music) arcade-style FM music.

<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And yeah I'm exaggerating about them sounding the same. </div><br />Not for the Genesis. For what Genesis I've heard, there were 4 instruments overall. A durm (and the same sound would simulate ALL drums), a kind of synth bass, an basic wave that sound like early digital organ, and one other wave which is used about everywhere and that sound like nothing (and sound very bad by the way). Also some noise is played I don't know if that's also a fifth instrument. At least it doesn't beat the NES' four fixed waveform in any way. The NES waveforms sound very clear and are very customizable. Genesis sound usually sound fuzzy, lound and agressive. I don't like it sounding at all. Lagrange point sound bad at some points, and I think it could be ported to pure NES music not so hardly and not sound much worse (just look at CV2 and CV3, I prefer their western version by far for music for some reason even if they use less channels), but Lagrange Point still sounds better than the very few Genesis games I've played under an emulator (those were Castlevania Bloodlines, Battletoads and maybe some other games I don't even remember).<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I guess my main point is that the quality of the music has much, MUCH more to do with the time and effort put into it than it has to do with the nature of the sound hardware.</div><br />Well, I partially agree. The sound hardware still have to offer nice sounds to the user. But that's true that you gan get great things with very lîmited hardware. Typically I think Gradius has awesome music for some reason even using only 2 of the NES' 5 audio channels !! For some reason Enix decided to do the same developpind Dragon Quest 1 (using only 2 channels) but most of it sounds bland to me (fortunately this will be fixed later in the series). I think a minimum of channels and features should be guaranted for good sounding music, but that bad use of any good soundchip will be bad, for sure. I'm sure there is Genesis games sounding good, I've just play none of them (I've only played about 4 Genesis games ever, and that under emulation so I'm not an expert here, heh).<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Thank heavens the SNES didn't take the FM route.</div>
<br />Yeah, I agree. Who knowns how bad would great soundtracks like Chrono Trigger or Tales of Phantasia sound on a piss SPU using some FM or AM technique.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The only Genesis games that I can say sounded good were the <em>Sonic</em> games (particularily <em>Sonic 3</em>) and <em>Zero Wing</em> (beautiful music, beautifully rendered on the Genesis sound chip.) <em>Lost Vikings</em> and <em>Comix Zone</em> weren't bad either. But yeah, a lot of Genesis titles blew chunks; the most memorably bad in my experience is the 32X <em>DOOM,</em> because the original game had great songs which were fairly well-rendered on the default executable and fared even better when fans created a nicer OPL2 instrument set (found in zDOOM.) But the 32X version had the most muddled, muffled instruments and terrible drum sounds I've ever heard in a game.
<br />
<br />But that ties back into my point, which is that it's not the hardware, but rather what you do with it. Certainly, the scores for <em>Chrono Trigger</em> and <em>Final Fantasy 6</em> would have fared worse on the Genesis, simply because they use many real instruments or very close approximations thereof which are difficult to recreate even on detailed 4-op FM hardware like the Genesis has (strings are <em>notoriously</em> difficult.) But had Uematsu or Mitsuda or other similarily creative and intelligent composers been composing for the Genesis, they would have written and arranged music to fit what the sound hardware could do well, rather than taking grand aspirations of orchestral majesty and expecting them to work well on a synthesizer chip. This is why, when composing for NES projects, I always use Modplug Tracker with the NES waveforms and a few DMC drums and only five channels, rather than writing something grander and cutting it down to fit.
<br />
<br />Yes, a large number of Genesis games use no more than a dozen instruments for the whole soundtrack, most of them cheap implementations of General MIDI standard instruments, but the sound hardware itself is capable of much, much more variety and much higher quality than that. The poor music quality is the fault of the game, not the chip.
<br />
<br />Also, people had better quit beating on <em>Lagrange Point</em> or I'm going to have to get out the whacking stick.
<br />
<br />Also also, technical detail dump time:
<br />
<br />The FDS uses a waveform table, yes, but it also incorporates a lower-resolution frequency-modulation table, which is what I meant when I said it incorporates simple FM. Check out the falling-down-a-hole sound effect in <em>Ai Senshi Nicol/Nicoru</em> for a great example of this in use =)
<br />
<br />The VRC7, while using a very similar synthesizer core to the OPL2 (Adlib,) is much more limited, in that it is stuck with 15 predefined instruments and one customizable instrument, so Adlib demo music isn't a very fair comparison. <em>Illusion City</em> is a much fairer comparison, since it uses essentially the same sound chip, the OPLL, although I believe the presets are different. And we can argue <em>Illusion City Vs. Lagrange Point</em> if you want, but that's much more a matter of personal preference than of technical aptitude.
<br />
<br />The Genesis has two sound chips, the YM2612, which provides the FM sounds and is capable of a humongous (and I do mean humongous) variety of sounds, any of which may or may not float your boat, and the TI SN6489, which is the same chip as in the SMS and MSX (included for SMS backwards compatibility,) and produces three square wave channels (non-adjustable pulse width) and one white noise channel.
<br />
<br />For the sake of completion, though I'm sure most of you know this, the SNES has one sound chip, the SPC-700, which has a CPU, 32KB of RAM, and a hardware waveform decompressor and 8-channel mixer, along with some simple noise-generation, envelop, and filtering hardware.
<br />
<br />P.S. While I agree that a lot of many-channel music can be cut down to stock NES standards and still sound good, I'm going to have to disagree with you, Bregalad, in regards to CV3. <em>Akumajou Densetsu</em>'s score is far, far nicer than CV3's.

They really remeber me Donkey Kong County, but I guess DKC was a lot copied from Sonic in regard to release dates. They just have drums sounding a lot better than in CV-Bloodlines, but the main instruments are still similary fuzzy.
<br />However, Street of Rage 2 really has great music ! It doesn't sound like the same soundchip at all ! I think if used well the chip can play very well synth-techno style music and is weak for melodic-classic like music, but still, SNES chip can do both. Genesis' SPU definitely CAN be well used, but it look harder to use than the SNES one. And all Genesis games I've tried had bland sound effects as compared to some SNES games or even older NES games. Well, some SNES and NES games have bland sound effects too, but most don't.
<br />
<br />Also, it's good that sega decided to keep the old sound channels on it, because it's always cool to have several hardware square and noise wave channels hanging arround, like on the GBA for example. Filtered square waves of the SNES of Donkey Kong Country and Dragon Quest games doesn't sound too good I think.

Only a few of CT's track, such as Magus Castle track or the drum-only track of pre-historic ages just cannot be ported on a older chip, regardless of how well the song is arranged. Otherwise, I think songs can very often be arranged to always sound decent on any soundchip.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">For the sake of completion, though I'm sure most of you know this, the SNES has one sound chip, the SPC-700, which has a CPU, 32KB of RAM, and a hardware waveform decompressor and 8-channel mixer, along with some simple noise-generation, envelop, and filtering hardware. </div>
<br />Actually the SPC-700 have 64kB of RAM, have complete looped samples support (as opposed to just waveforms) and have actually quite complex enveloppe and filtering hardware (filtering is ONLY applied to echoed sound, tough). Also you don't mention pitch modulation, wich is very useful for sound effects.
