<br />I understand. Personally I'd rather use the time I'd waste checking all of those things to develop my own version of the code in question instead. Like I said, when it comes to coding I am a control freak, I'm aware of that.

<br />
<br />Yeah, 3kB sounds about right.  The data size is more important (and yeah NT2's NED files can compress a lot further - like MatrixZ's NESnake did).  I figure I would reserve at least 16kB for music code/data, probably more though.  With uncompressed NED's that's not a heck of a lot of music (Solar Wars' soundtrack was 16kB, not counting the DPCM samples).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I apologize if this has been mentioned before (I didn't read the entire thread before replying), but I really think the problem is a lack of public libraries.
<br />
<br />Not the kind you read books in, but the kind that supply basic functionality, like PPU management, sound driving, controller input, that kind of thing. I already have "system code" like this that I use in my projects, and I'm working on a public release of my sound engine already, and unless I'm mistaken, Neil was working on a release of his sound engine as well.
<br />
<br />That's good for getting the NES up and running, so next, it'd be nice to have libraries to handle game engines. Actor management with collision detection, possibly some level-loading/rendering libraries, sprite management/animation, that sort of thing.
<br />
<br />Then, it'd be absolutely awesome to have a giant repository of free-to-use graphics and resources.
<br />
<br />The biggest problem I personally keep running into is that it's very difficult to code a game from the ground up (including the system code), with no help, and often, it requires too much effort than what I have, and I lose interest in the project.

<br />I dont thinink this is a problem I have long done all of this stuff and yet I'm still stuck in the development of my game. The problem is coding enemies' AI and no tool can fix it.

Nintendo has got it to the point where AI is just Action Instructions. Sure, it would be limited, probably to single-screen games, but then at least people would be able to make their own NES games with less need for obsessive dedication.

<br />
<br />I would like a library, though.  Small routines that have been tested and optimized and will be generally useful for most people.  I am always worried that I'm coding the wrong way, wasting too much time in functions that are used often.

<br />Games based on those engines are called "hacks", not "homebrews", as I hinted in the first post in this topic. That's why I was trying to make my own side-scroller engine last summer before I got sidetracked by my day job and my physical fitness.

<br />Whatever they're called, they're still easier than making something from scratch, which is why people would sooner go that route than even using a homebrew engine or game maker analogue.  Hacks have shown us that if a person doesn't have to put much effort into one aspect (the coding), they'll tend to not put effort into the rest either.
<br />
<br />Plus I have a hard time advocating a system that encourages people to not bother learning the actual mechanisms behind the game they're working on.  And I probably wouldn't want to buy or even play a game that I know has been built from a simple template - I have a hard time getting into stuff from RPGMaker, for example.

It's easier to get collaboration when 1. a producer is signing paychecks, or 2. there are enough developers in a geographic area that they can meet face to face. Guess what the homebrew scene lacks: money and density.

<br />
<br />Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 and 2 comes to mind.  Maybe Civilization.  For sure though it can't be expected that any designer/programmer would also have done exactly 100% of the graphics and sound for any platform in any time period.

<br />For example, MM1 credits:
<br />
<br />1 planner
<br />4 character designers
<br />1 programmer
<br />2 sound programmers
<br />
<br />Granted, people are using a lot more advanced tools now than back in the day, but that's just one person (in his spare time) doing a task that would normally be done by a team (9:00 to 5:00 and getting paid).  I'm not saying it's impossible, it's just pretty inefficient- albeit fun, challenging, etc.  And I think that's why some of the projects around here never get finished.
<br />
<br />I think a good way to get more homebrew games out would be teamwork.

<br />
<br />I know a guy who made and sold his own XBLA game to fairly decent success.  It's called Epiphany in Spaaace! and it's basically an interactive novel. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  But his second game, Breath of Death VII: The Beginning, is a full RPG and was just him and one other person.
<br />
<br />I imagine a lot of XBLA games are made by one person.
<br />
<br />World of Goo was made by two people, if I remember right.  Incredibly successful.  and lots of other popular indie games are similar in that respect: Cave Story, Spelunky, Within a Deep Forest, Knytt Stories, all made by very few people.  At the most it's a programmer, artist, and a musician.
