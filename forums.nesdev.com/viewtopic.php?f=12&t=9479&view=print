You'd think they would test to make sure their legs were long enough, but you'd have thought wrong.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZsgBql.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />DIP 8 toggles the logic to /RESET.<br /><br />I'll add 10Kohm pulldown resistors to ensure off = logic lo instead of open only if I can get things working with logic hi first. There should never be a time when pins 1+16 are high at the same time (that would select both ROMs on a board.)<br /><br />But I'll keep in mind to use 1Kohm resistors instead of wires in the future. I'd be a bit concerned about the wires touching each other, since there is no insulation around resistor wire.

(1K resistor into this pin from what ordinarily should be the + of the battery, but +5V should be okay).<br /><br /><br />Any number of reasons as to why I think this would also be an enable pin... so it would fail the test at the factory if the battery was bad, to just the design engineer taking everything so literally. Well, that's not so true either, because a lot of these kind of circuits fail when the battery dies. I think it has something to do with the early backup battery circuits being unable to switch from one power source (the battery) to the other (the system +5V) if {EDIT FOR CLARITY} if the battery voltage is not present.<br /><br />Also, yes. the socket is unnecessary on a breadboard. Especially if it is a &quot;low profile solder tail&quot; socket. Yeah it won't stay in as it's meant to be soldered.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Didn't knew that there is a MAD-R chip. I wonder what it's intended for.<br />Maybe it is intentionally changing the memory mapping; does the game require special mapping?<br />Or maybe it's related to the Mosel SRAM, though I couldn't imagine why it'd require a different battery controller.<br /><br />Just noticed that (aside from your SHVC-2A3M-01 boards), the SHVC-2A3M-<strong>10</strong> is also marked to accept MAD-1 and MAD-R chips. The later SHVC-2A3M-<strong>11</strong> version is marked MAD-1 only. Looks as if nintendo has discontinued the MAD-R after soon.<br /><br />MAD-1 logic table is here:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/fullsnes.htm#snespinoutsmadchips">http://nocash.emubase.de/fullsnes.htm#s ... tsmadchips</a><!-- m --><br />it's dumped from a desoldered mad-1 chip, wired to pc parallel port, the adaptor looks like this:<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<br />
	</div><br />aside from just logging, it's also calculating and verifying the expected results (done to confirm that my logic table conclusions were correct).<br /><br />If I get a cartridge with MAD-2 or MAD-R I could test it the same way. MAD-2 is probably inverting reset for the DSP chip, or maybe amplifying the clock input.<br /><br />Desoldering chips works fine with one of those &quot;vacuum pumps&quot; (or how they are called), they are cheap ($2 maybe).<br />The holes (vias) are important for passing wires from one side of PCB to another. When installing the chips (in a soldering bath) some of the vias are naturally getting soaked with solder too, that's just a don't care dirt effect.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The answer to your question on the solder-filled vias, I'm not sure why they fill them.  The holes are already plated.  A via is a plated hole which carries a trace between layers on the board.  Filling the holes with solder may be done to protect against corrosion, I suppose, but it is not necessary for fulfilling the purpose of creating continuity between board layers.  In fact, if the holes were not metal-plated, the solder would not flow into the holes at all.  The solder has absolutely zero effect on functionality, so don't try to understand why some are filled and some are not.  There is no meaning to this whatsoever, if there are some unfilled it was likely a manufacturing oversight.  Also, the reason the MAD-1 is handling the battery power is so that they could simplify the design.  Look at the difference between these two boards:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.snescentral.com/pcbboards.php?chip=SHVC-1A3B-20">http://www.snescentral.com/pcbboards.ph ... VC-1A3B-20</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.snescentral.com/pcbboards.php?chip=SHVC-1A3M-20">http://www.snescentral.com/pcbboards.ph ... VC-1A3M-20</a><!-- m --><br /><br />All of the additional resistors, capacitors, and diodes found on the 1A3B board make up the power management circuit used to handle proper power handoff to the battery at shutdown, as well as driving the RAM /CS line high during power on/off to avoid writing garbage to SRAM during those undefined and unstable periods.  This is true of all non-MAD boards vs their MAD counterparts (SHVC-XXXB vs SHVC-XXXM)  Once Nintendo decided to manufacture an ASIC for the memory mapping, it just became more reasonable to add power management transistor logic into that same chip and handle it all in one simple package, rather than using several passive components.

The LEDs go to full brightness with pin 10 (well, of course it's a bit dimmer than with pin 6 power due to the extra 1K resistor.)<br /><br />To be more specific: with pin 6 wired to +5V bat, the LEDs are getting +3.5V input. With only pin 7 wired to +5V bat, the LEDs are getting +2V. That's before the resistors further reduce their power. With only pin 7 wired, and all inputs grounded, only LEDs 2&amp;5 are getting only +1.9V<br /><br />Any others ideas? ;_;<br /><br />&gt; Should give you a good place to start.<br /><br />Well, the MAD-1 schematic doesn't really help me.

I tested, and A22 on the cartridge bus goes to pin 12 on the MAD-1 and pin 12 on the MAD-R, no difference.
