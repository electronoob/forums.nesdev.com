<br />Okay, so reading your post again that does make perfect sense to me.  But then what sampling frequency should I use to generate the coefficients?  Would it still be 21MHz? Or would it be 21M/256?  Or something else?  If it's still 21M then even with the unified decimation (decimation does not change a filter's response) the filter response would still be what I've shown <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/36237540/kevtris_response.PNG" class="postlink">here</a> (which is incredibly crappy and is getting nowhere near the cutoff). Ideas?
<br />
<br />I need the correct sampling frequency in order to generate the proper coefficient values with matlab.
<br />
<br />Fcutoff = 20kHz
<br />Fsampling = ??

That said, I don't understand why you're generating the audio at a higher rate than the NES did originally —you're not generating any genuine data; you're probably just adding a lossy interpolation stage (that's hopefully rejected by whatever FIR).<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If it's still 21M then even with the unified decimation (decimation does not change a filter's response) the filter response would still be what I've shown <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/36237540/response.PNG" class="postlink">here</a> (which is incredibly crappy and is getting nowhere near the cutoff).

<br />I'd generate the audio at the same rate the NTSC NES does — 1.789773MHz. At that point, I'd pick a FIR filter that achieved 40dB rejection at your cutoff -- Using <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~fisher/mkfilter/racos.html">http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~fisher/ ... racos.html</a><!-- m --> I've gotten useful response graphs with Fcutoff=16kHz, beta=.1, length=257 and beta=.9, length=501. Per his page, if you want to run the input audio faster, you'll want to increase the length of the FIR filter by the same ratio.
<br />
<br />In terms of decimation ratios relative to S/PDIF rates, I see ~1% errors for 1789773Hz/41 -&gt; 44.1kHz, 1789773Hz/37 -&gt; 48kHz, and a 0.1% error for 1789773Hz/56 -&gt; 32kHz (although that would need a different cutoff frequency for the filter).
<br />
<br />One last anecdote that may be helpful: on the NES's audio output stage, there is a first order <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=44320#44320" class="postlink">analog lowpass at 14kHz</a>

<br />Hello all! I have an awesome update!  What lidnariq described above is something that I had never learned/known about FIR filters before.  But after I read it and it made sense to me I ventured to go and try to figure out how to do it.  And I did!
<br />
<br />Lidnariq has previously referred to his filter description as a "unified FIR-and-decimate". I have come to learn that these types of filters are also very often called "polyphase" FIRs.  And dang are these things freakin _awesome_. You can implement insanely efficient FIR filters with very little resource usage.
<br />
<br />I still haven't figured out exactly how Kevtris implemented his but I imagine it was some type of polyphase filter. But even if it was, his description still does not make complete sense to me nor can I see how it would work properly given the clock rates he mentions.  But regardless, I don't really care anymore at this point since my new FIR implementation is so efficient.  I can now implement a 512-tap FIR with only 32 multiplies! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":-o" title="Surprised" />  And if I cared to increase the filter's operating clock frequency I could do it with even fewer.  Not only that but the frequency of the output samples from the FIR is already decimated to the exact frequency that I need.  Rockin!
<br />
<br />I would like to thank everyone who helped me and also thank them for their persistence in trying to beat this into my noggin. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I have learned at least twice what I originally knew about FIR filter implementations.
<br />
<br />Here are some output samples from Solstice (noise channel only) with my new polyphase FIR filter in case you're interested.  It's coolest if you DL them all and then compare them to one another - it's really neat to hear how the increasing number of taps steadily improves the aliasing and pitch.

<br />I'll go whip up a version without any anti-aliasing to see if has the same problem.
