But the NES is suited for platform fighting games, whose characters are anywhere from the size of <em>Double Dragon</em> characters to the size of <em>Shaq-Fu</em> characters. <em>Street Fighter 2010</em> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU21wBNSVWU" class="postlink">AVGN review</a>) was an early attempt at this style; <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> perfected it.<br /><br />But the real reason a collaborative fighting game doesn't take off is that it takes roughly 150 frames of art for each character.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Jan 10, 2015 5:29 pm</p><hr />

I think we already had a discussion about this and came with the conclusion that what would work best for a collaborative project would be making a fighting game, where everyone creates different chargers, as it is usually not a problem when people with very different styles show up (like the ... vs Capcom series or Super Smash Bros).<br /><br />However the idea didn't go very far as nobody wanted to took the lead of the project, and that the NES hardware is unsuited for 1-to-1 fighting games (assuming the chracters have a body), unless an advanced mapper such as the MMC5 is used.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Jan 10, 2015 10:56 am</p><hr />

I guess what I'm saying here is that I would like to dive into something to gain some experience making a game. I would like to make my own game on my own but lack the skills and its pretty difficult, but if I were just issued one part in making a game I feel as if I could reasonably learn that part and work on something. But there doesn't seem to be any ongoing projects that you can just jump into and help out currently. <br /><br />If you split the work between a small group of people, not only could you possibly finish the game sooner but the quality might even be better because each person would be working in their own field of expertise. <br /><br />It could be a game to show off peoples talents from the community as well. If its never been done on here before then why not try it? Some people like me would help out simply for the experience in making a NES game or if the game is really really good, it would be nice to you that you played a part in it somehow.<br /><br />Also decisions could be made on the voting community here. For example:<br /><br />Why type of game would you want to see?<br /><br />a) Side scrolling shooter<br />b) Top down scrolling shooter<br />c) RPG<br />d) Platformer<br />e) Puzzle type game<br />f) Adventure<br />g) Educational<br /><br />The one with the most votes would win and be the type of game to make.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6785">Erockbrox</a> — Sat Jan 03, 2015 5:43 am</p><hr />

In my opinion, collaboration would be a problem for people who don't even know themselves in the real world.

Then perhaps we could break into teams, with 2 to 4 people per team. Some of us would post design documents, others could sign on if they find a project interesting, and then each team would work on its own project.<br /><br />So what are your visions, guys?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Jan 02, 2015 2:37 pm</p><hr />

My sentiments mirror that of thefox.<br /><br />Usually community collaboration projects/games, at least on classic consoles, tend to have 3 or 4 people at most.  For example, Demiforce's Drymouth game involved only 3 people (coder/graphics, graphics, and musician).<br /><br />The larger the number of people, the more likely there will be excessive amounts of pondering over minuscule things, or heated arguments over design choices (and never coming to full agreement).  And if you have people who have large egos, eventually those can rear their heads and cause massive issues (i.e. someone leaves the project).  Do not think even for a minute you can find a replacement by snapping your fingers -- it isn't that easy.<br /><br />Back in the 90s I worked with Riff on our qNES emulator, which was just him and I.  We never ran into any of those scenarios, but that's also because he knew a hell of a lot more than I did (esp. about things like cache lines and writing assembly code so that it fit within those cache limits -- something I still to this day haven't bothered to learn), and it made the most sense to accept his expertise, while I did other things (working on graphics code, trying to implement framework for mappers, etc.).  But that's a different beast than, say, designing an actual video game -- a <strong>**LOT**</strong> more is involved there.<br /><br />To support all my claims, check out the following game called Cube World, which has been worked on by just *one guy* and he explains somewhere (FAQ, blog post, I forget) that he wanted it to be developed entirely by him (and the majority has been), but eventually branched out to get one more developer (not sure what their role is).  And for efforts of basically 1 guy, it's pretty damn amazing: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wollay.blogspot.com/">http://wollay.blogspot.com/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Now compare that to, say, large-scale Kickstarter indie game projects which consist of say 10-20 people, or commercial games which consist of probably 50 (not including any outsourcing, which is SUPER common; even Nintendo does this quite heavily!) people, and how awful those games turn out most of the time.  No, not all the time, but most (IMO).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Fri Jan 02, 2015 2:14 pm</p><hr />

I think the idea is to find a single project that covers different members' intersecting visions.<br /><br />Case in point: RHDE wasn't my vision. It was originally the vision of one of my cousin's classmates. But I jumped in because I was able to make it intersect my own visions 1. to build with blocks while dissociating myself from a certain Russian-born programmer who hates the free software model and 2. to implement a game suitable for my &quot;DX&quot; fictional setting.<br /><br />My next vision is to make a SMB1 clone that can replace SMB1 hacking as a means of producing a side-scrolling NES game. If the first game on this engine is in someone else's world, so be it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Jan 01, 2015 8:13 pm</p><hr />

This usually doesn't work. Most homebrewers want to have full creative control of their projects, and the level of control decreases greatly with each new person that joins the project.
