<br />He says to take a tiny flathead screwdriver and slip it into the seam on the side of the cart.  When you have pried it open a little bit, stick another thin-bladed tool in there to prop it open (freeing your flathead screwdriver).  Then, with your tiny flathead screwdriver, "move, wait, pry".  As you do this, the crack will gradually get bigger (presumably you'd do this all the way around the cart?  though he doesn't say this specifically).  Do this carefully over and over and eventually you'll get it open.

<br />Thanks for the link. I didn't think to search in japanese (duh), my habit to use english only <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I tried to do it with a tiny flat screwdriver but from the side... hmmm.. The chance are good that you could damage the bezel a little bit at the insertion point too.
<br />
<br />Put the pins are quite hell. The way they're made, it's almost like it was not supposed to be re-opened again almost.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The trick is to use Quick Grips.
<br />
<br />Line them up on the front cover on both sides, not top and bottom but sides. Slowly gripping it, the cart front will begin to bend upwards, its at that point you can safely use a very, very flat screwdriver or a knife blade so gently ease open the latches. I got this info from the man himself.
<br />
<br />Don't stick anything in the sides or you will end up scratching it all to hell or breaking a latch; an exception is the poorly made multicarts and pirate carts, they usually have easily to open cases.

<br />
<br />But I got a copy of Lagrange Point today and I want to crack it open and play with it's VRC7 goodness.  Looks like this is the best I could find and Bootgod's method apparently.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgCiAOmgeFc" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgCiAOmgeFc</a>
<br />
<br />Just thought if might be worth asking the question again.  I tried awhile back to open a FC cart and gave up with the conclusion I had to tear the sticker off to get at a what I thought was a hidden screw.  But apparently there is no said screw...
<br />
<br />All I have is a vice, might try to put some sort of protector on it to prevent scratching.  However picking up some of those clamps is probably the better choice.
<br />
<br />If you guys have came up with any other tips in the past couple years I'd love to hear em.

<br />
<br />It may not be the answer that you're looking for but since I live in japan and getting some VRC6/7 cost almost nothing, I gave up on the fact that I may break pins while opening them. When you can get them for a 1$ or 2$, you don't mind anymore but I do understand that for most people this is not the case.
<br />
<br />If you use it for a dev cart you shouldn't mind about the breaking pins stuff anyway. This is how I made peace with that subject <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Honestly, I doubt these cartridge cases (also pirate Genesis) were designed to be opened. I think they were intended for one-time assembly, and if you lucky, you may take them apart a few times. I broke so much cases I can't even count, no matter how much experience with this I had.
<br />
<br />Genesis ones were easy to repair, at least - there were false plastic screws on the back, so you could cut them and put real screws (heat them to screw into the other side).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think your righT Shiru.  Although I wonder if they designed them to be extremely difficult to open if not impossible for small kids.  US carts warn to never open on the back label and use the security screws.  I'm guessing they took this idea even further with the FC carts.
<br />
<br />Yeah unfortunately I had to pay quite a bit more than $1-2 for the cart.  I don't plan to play or show case it much, but it's hard to get myself to accept damage to it with what great condition it's in.  Although I'd consider converting it if someone translated it.  That and the Japanese always care for things so much more than Americans.  Things like the box and full instruction set were no surprise with this item, but they would have been rare if it were US equipment.

The stuff sold abroad is usually the mint condition or something half mint that people wouldn't know the difference since they didn't saw how some stuff could be in good condition in the first place.
<br />
<br />If you go in the "junk" section, this is where you can find some loose VRC6/7 carts at 1$/2$ with may have connectors in no so great shape. So you have to look properly before buying. You can get at that price some just breed too if you search well.
