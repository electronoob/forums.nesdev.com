		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi all,
<br />
<br />Now that I have a few NROM devcarts, I want to try to make some basic demos that I can run on my NES.
<br />
<br />I don't know much about the 6502, but I recently purchased the book by Zaks that was mentioned in another thread. I must also admit that I don't know much about programming, but I am very willing to learn. I'm not looking for "try something easier first" or "this isn't for beginners". When I started the devcart stuff a few months ago, I never touched a soldering iron before. I'm not saying I'm a genius, but I think I pick up things rather quickly.
<br />
<br />I've messed around with editors, and have understand sprites, tiles, and other basic information. I want to try to make a simple demo - with a background and one sprite that I can move around the screen.
<br />
<br />I'm sure I went about this the wrong way - but I tried NBasic, and was able to make what I described above - but it only runs in what must be fairly inaccurate emulators. The ASM that NBasic spits out is pretty confusing - the code I see around here makes a bit more sense. I can post the Nbasic / ASM code if anyone wants to take a look. Perhaps the ASM can be cleaned up to run on other emulators, maybe even my NES.
<br />
<br />What I'm hoping for is some example code some of you may use in your programming - hopefully I can make sense of it as I continue to read and experiment. I would also like to compare it to the ASM spit out by NBasic. Also, if anyone has any simple demos like I'm trying for with source code available - that would be nice.
<br />
<br />If you read this far, thanks..
<br />

Or anything that will run on the NES at all. I suggest to first learn the 6502. I know, just like I did, you probably hate hearing that sentence, don't you? I did too. But when I snapped out of being lazy for a moment, I learned the 6502, and it is quite a simple language to understand. 
<br />
<br />I really don't want to show you how to make a moving sprite with a background right now, if you don't understand the 6502. It's like learning a different language(like spanish, japanese, etc., not like C/C++) , If I just taught you sentences, and not the structure or the vocabulary, you wouldn't learn anything (My spanish teacher teaches us alot of sentences as apposed to sentence structure, and it pisses me off!). Same thing here. If I were to just teach you how to do certain things with the NES, you'd never learn. You must learn the sentence structure and vocab. You'll then be able to come up with the sentence on your own. Understand?

<br />
<br />Since you are looking for NBASIC material and not 6502 assembly you might want to have a look at Bob Rost's website (if you already haven't).  He has some example code on his site.  Here  is the link:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://bobrost.com/nes/resources.php#code" class="postlink">http://bobrost.com/nes/resources.php#code</a>
<br />
<br />I didn't actually check any of the material though since I haven't done any NBASIC stuff (only 6502).
<br />
<br />Hope this helps.

<br />
<br />I enjoyed reading some of the PDF files that Bob Rost posted, they explain some NES soft/hardware in an easy to understand way.
<br />
<br />I won't be messing with Nbasic anymore, but it did help me understand a few things about graphics and tiles, etc.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, No Carrier, you should really listen to lynxsolaris. He got started in NES development not long ago and he is progressing rather nicely, so he might have some interesting tips to pass along to you. I've been helping him out a bit with the basics of setting up a game and he's doing pretty well.
<br />
<br />About Nbasic, you're right, just drop it. When you know 6502 assembly you're in control of everything, you gotta have that or you'll won't get far.
<br />
<br />Don't shoot me yet, but if you don't know 6502 ASM yet, you should <strong>really</strong> play with it a bit, away from the NES for a while. You can't control a machine if don't speak it's language. It's like if you have a fully qualified maid at home but you don't know how to give her the simple command "dust the furniture". Grab a copy of <a href="http://home.pacbell.net/michal_k/6502.html" class="postlink">Michal Kowalski's 6502 simulator</a> and analyse how the flags work, do some simple additions and subtractions, try a few conditional branches and stuff. You can run the code command by command and watch how they affect the flags, the memory and the stack, wich really helps in understanding what each command actually does, something you can't learn just from reading. You just can't.
<br />
<br />I say that because that's how I started. I read thousands of 6502 docs and never got to understand the stack, flags and branches (things not present in higher level languages I was used to) until I played with the simulator. Then, before moving to the NES, I developed a series of small routines in 6502 ASM so that I could think just as the processor works, and then code would flow easily from my head, wich it does now. I made multiplication and division routines and things like that. I can't tell how valuable that was for me.
<br />
<br />I really do not think it is healthy that you just get access to ready-made code that draws to the background and has a sprite move around so that you adapt it to your needs without actually knowing what's going on exactly, 'cause that only produces "nesticle code", wich is what you're already getting with Nbasic.
<br />
<br />I could give you a list of things that would be involved in getting what you want working, explaining why each step is necessary. Then you can try to understand it, in order, and get back to me/us when you have doubts on a specific step.
<br />
<br /><strong>1.</strong> The fisrt thing to do is turn rendering off (bit 3 and bit 4 of $2001 set to 0) so that you can work with the PPU freely whithout worring about writing to it at the correct time. When rendering is off, you can write to it at ANY time.
<br />
<br /><strong>2.</strong> Then you need to wait 2 or so VBlanks to go by, because the PPU needs some time before it is ready to be used.
<br />
<br /><strong>3.</strong> Now you can just draw all the tiles you want to the screen. You'll want to start with name table 0, wich is at PPU address $2000 (not the register, this is the PPU addressing space). You write the address you want to write to (in this case $2000) to register $2006 one byte at a time (first $20 and then $00). Then you write the codes of the tiles you want in the screen to register $2007, one tile at a time, until the whole screen is filled with tiles.
<br />
<br /><strong>4.</strong> After the BG is ready, you have to set the initial position of your sprite. It is recommended that you don't use registers $2003/$2004 to handle sprites, but reserve a page (256 butes) in RAM to write your sprite definitions and move them to OAM by a DMA transfer at a later time. So, clear this whole page you choose to use with the value $FF (or any othe value that will keep the sprites you're not using off the screen), but set the first sprite (or any othe you fell like) with the information needed to display it in the middle of the screen, for example. Do the DMA transfer to put your sprite(s) in place (write the number of the page you used for sprite definitions to register $4014). You'll also probably want to write your palette now.
<br />
<br /><strong>5.</strong> Now we're almost set to turn our screen on, but you'll won't want to do it without knowing it is the correct time to do so. If you just turn it on without any worries, you may end up doing so when the light cannon of the TV is in the middle of the screen, wich will result in a partially displayed screen, and, although it happens really really fast, it's still a glitch. So you wait for VBlank.
<br />
<br /><strong>6.</strong> Now, we're inside VBlank, and you should do the last few arrangements so that your screen is displayed properly. Set $2000 and $2001 accordingly to what your intention are (indicate what side of the patterna table you're using for sprites and BG, set the name table to display to the name table you drew the BG to, that kind of thing). Rendering can be turned on already too, it's safe to do it inside the VBlank. You'll want to turn NMI's on here to, as you'll be rading the joypad every frame and updating the sprite's position. You'll also need to set the scroll values to 0 (write $00 to 2005 twice), to make sure the screen will be static at the correct position.
<br />
<br /><strong>7.</strong> Since all the set up is over, and you enambled NMI's, all the rest will be responsability of the NMI routine. Your main code can just enter into an infinite loop now.
<br />
<br /><strong>8.</strong> Now onto the NMI, wich will take care of all the rest. The NMI starts when each VBlank does. So all the writing to the PPu has to be handled first. All the writing you'll be doing is update the sprite's position, so you can just do a sprite DMA as the first thing in the NMI.
<br />
<br /><strong>9.</strong> The next thing to do in the NMI (well, all the rest is NMI so I'll just stop saying it ok?) after all the PPU writing is finished is to set the scroll register back to place ($00 twice). This has to be done every frame to make sure your screen will never "jump", and will always stay pretty and still.
<br />
<br /><strong>10.</strong> Onto the "game" logic now. You have to read the joypad now. And react to the 4 different directions that can be pressed. If the player pressed UP, decrement the Y coordinate of your sprite (wich is in that page you chose before, remember?). If the player pressed DOWN you'll increment Y. If he pressed LEFT you'll decrement the X position and if he pressed RIGHT you'll increment X. Of course the sprite will wrap from the edges of the screen to the opposite edge, but that's ok for a simple demo. Now you've done all the logic, just exit the NMI (RTI command).
<br />
<br />That's about it. Since you changed the coordinates of the sprite it will be drawn at the new position in the next NMI. I may have left some details off (although that was a huge ass post!), I'm not perfect, but we'll check that along the way, ok?
<br />
<br />Good luck.

That's actually what you <strong>should</strong> do. I didn't mean to be like "I'm not going to help you, so fuck off." I tried to point you in the right direction, so you could truly <strong> understand</strong> what you are doing. And what are you trying to say when linking me to that forum? That has nothing to do with anything. I used to be like "Hey, I don't know how to do this. Show me a routine." But then I stopped doing that. I didn't understand the 6502, and that was a big mistake. So I was trying to prevent you from making that mistake. Not trying to say "Fuck off, I won't help."
<br />
<br />And thank you for digging up old post that was like 100 years old, and for trying to make me feel dumb in every way possible. It didn't work. Go here: <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.freewebs.com/the_bott/gbaguy.zip">www.freewebs.com/the_bott/gbaguy.zip</a><!-- w --> . This guys site is dead, and I seem to be the only one that downloaded his tutorials, a long time ago. I admit, I should've linked you hear instead of saying "Go learn 6502 somewhere else, then you'll truly understand." He'll say in the beggining of these tutorials, "You must know the 6502 by now!" But as you read, you'll realize, he's teaching you 6502 as you go along. He uses NESASM, so you'll need that. Once these tutorials are read, you want to leave them behind in the dust. They are fairly inaccurate in many aspects, but they really boosted me into the world of NESdev.

<br />EDIT: Oh, these tutorials are on my site, but the guy that made these tutorials, his site is dead.

<br />I see I was like that like my first week on NESdev. But I learned that you shouldn't be like that, you won't really learn. I didn't learn from whatever they posted below that. I don't remember what they posted about! But the tutorials I linked you to teach you as you read. And I apollogize for coming off rude, I didn't mean to sound like I was telling you to fuck off. I suppose you should be shown some sample routines, and pick them apart as you learn about the 6502.

If you don't understand what exactly is beeing done, you alter so it <strong>looks</strong> like what you want, but you may mess something up in the way.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><em>Dr. Mario</em> for NES has this glitch.</div><br />Small glitch, but still a glitch.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Nice tutorial. I and probably a lot of others would appreciate it if you adapted your tutorial for use on the <a href="http://nesdevwiki.ath.cx/" class="postlink">new wiki</a>.</div>
<br />Yeah, I didn't plan to write a tutorial at first.. but yeah, it looks like a tutorial now. It could turn into something like "10 steps to your first NES program" or something with a name just as cheesy! =)
<br />
<br />EDIT: Oh, No Carrier, use GBAGuy's tutorial with extreme caution. As Celius said they might help you get off the ground, but they are very famous for beeing innacurate. Don't take everything you read there for the absolute truth, as bad habits are hard to drop.

<br />
<br />Thanks again everyone. This answers and info in this thread should keep me busy for a while!

Do not put it in $8000-$BFFF, otherwise it won't play. It will play on an emulator, but not on the real hardware. I think that's correct. I think I heard that in the "Bank Switching" forum.
