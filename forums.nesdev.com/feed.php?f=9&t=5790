I bought a leaper-3C, a Taiwanese (?) programmer which the price was (I think) affordable for ~160$.  It's well built, the program is not so bad to use once you learn how to use it but there is just one issue: it slow as hell..  It's made for duplicating chips, which mean in stand-alone, it's quite fast, maybe 30 seconds (that what they said). But when you copy from the software.. It can take easily 4-5 minutes, which I find not acceptable. <br /><br />I could have ordered online but I preferred to go to a store and buy it.  I have to live with it now. At the least it's USB... I'm sure the cause it's so slow is because the software is poorly written but there is nothing I can do.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Wed Mar 03, 2010 7:00 am</p><hr />

Well if you think $350 is expensive you should look at mine which I bought for arround $500. It's Elnec brand, I think it can program/re-program/verify/dump all EPROMs, EEPROMs, FlashROMs, and serial ROMs. It can't dump NES roms which are linked to a bankswitched circuit, but I was able to dump a couple of NROM games using it. It can also verify opperation of SRAMs and program self-battery backed SRAMs (the chips that are really tall because the battery in included in them), that I used before I got my powerpak.<br /><br />Of course I bought it just before the Power Pak and Super Power Pak came out, so I didn't know I was going to put it back inside a drawer so fast. Also I was disapointed that it can't reprogram micro controllers, a programmer who does only micro-controllers is also ~$700+ and one which does both EPROMs and micro-controllers is about $1000+. I would have hoped that for $500 it supported at least some of the more classic micros, but it doesn't.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Mar 03, 2010 6:51 am</p><hr />

Don't worry about the price guys, I got used to the fact that my government are a bunch of thieves and that there are a lot of things I can't own because of that, even though technically I do have the money to buy them. And once in a while I will have to spend more than a person who lives in a country with less strict import policies if I really want to own certain things.<br /><br />BTW, I installed it, played with it a bit and so far everything works great. Got it working right on the first try, no problems whatsoever (which is more than I can say about my old Willem). I'm even feeling motivated to work on some devcart projects now (NES and otherwise). =)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Mar 03, 2010 6:37 am</p><hr />

I brought a Wellon VP-280 programmer when I got a new pc and realised to my horror that there was no parallel ports on it. (I did get a PCI parallel port later so I could use one of my other two programmers).<br /><br />The software is updated regularly and it has support for testing TTL and ram chips which is damn handy for me.<br /><br />They have a forum and support is good, albiet in engrish sometimes.<br /><br />It also does 16 bit eproms like the 27c322,27c4096,etc. I've even programmed NVRAM chips with it.<br /><br />I've not had a problem programming 12v,21v,25v chips although you have to make sure you are using the power adapter when programming the higher voltage chips.<br /><br />It's programmed plenty of chips in it's life too, as I repair arcade pcbs as well. I'm very happy with it.<br /><br />:edit: $350!!!! Wow.. You can buy them for $150 including shipping on ebay.

Wellons are MUCH better than Willems! They have universal pin drivers (yours has almost universal) allowing them to program a lot more than 8-bit ROMs (almost all Willems are good for) and do chip tests etc. The really expensive Wellons have truly universal drivers so in theory just about any chip could be supported. Willem don't have any pin drivers, they use DIP switches to route power rails and perform a couple address/control line swaps, but otherwise the pins are hard wired.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Tue Mar 02, 2010 3:49 pm</p><hr />

I sure hope it's good, 'cause it cost me over US$350, much more than I was willing to spend originally. Anyway, I received it today as expected, it looks really nice.

I ended up buying a WELLON VP-280 yesterday. Does anyone know if by any chance that's a better brand than WILLEM (what's up with the similar names anyway?)?<br /><br />I almost got the TOP2004 but after reading some bad reviews I went with the WELLON. It was more expensive (so I expect it to be better), and certainly more expensive than if I had bought it from an international store, but considering the import taxes and shipping I guess it paid off to buy from a local store. Plus, the thing will probably be here tomorrow, instead of taking a month+ to arrive (if it even arrived, I've been having bad luck with international shipping, I haven't received the last 2 things I was supposed to).<br /><br />The software appears to be in eng<strong>r</strong>ish as well (I guess this will be the case with every chinese programmer). Although the store said they have it in portuguese, and even though I don't usually use software in portuguese I guess I will if it's better translated than the eng<strong>r</strong>ish version.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm just checking if anyone has had any experience with WELLON programmers.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Mar 01, 2010 11:19 pm</p><hr />
