<br />The only thing that is known as for banks is PRG C000-FFFF is fixed to the last bank at start up for all versions of MMC1.  That way your startup code can be placed there only and it's known that it'll be hit at start up.

<br />And I'm not sure what you mean by WRAM, there is only one bank...  whether or not the WRAM is enabled at power up depends on which version of MMC1.

<br />
<br />Really?  I thought we had decided the opposite.  That it could be on any 32k page at startup, so you need to copy your reset code to the end of each 32k bank.

<br />
<br />If you're asking about whether or not it's enabled or disabled at start-up Kevtris explains it pretty well: <a href="http://kevtris.org/mappers/mmc1/index.html" class="postlink">http://kevtris.org/mappers/mmc1/index.html</a> it depends on what version of MMC1.  But for MMC1A there is not disabling unless CA16 output is tied to WRAM /CE like on SNROM boards.  MMC1B can be disabled but it's unknown at startup.  Only MMC1C is known and it starts up as disabled.  I haven't verified any of this personally but I trust what Kevtris is saying.
<br />
<br />Dwedit:
<br />Can you point me where this was determined?
<br />
<br />Kevtris is a little ambiguous in his docs but states that,"Bank C000-FFFFh is fixed, while 8000-FFFFh is swappable. (power-on default)"
<br />
<br />And according to Disch:
<br />
<br />On Powerup:
<br />----------------------------
<br />
<br />This varies from version to version.  Earlier MMC1 versions have no determined startup state.  Later ones do.
<br />
<br /> - bits 2,3 of $8000 are set (16k PRG mode, $8000 swappable)
<br />
<br />Now I only played around with MMC1B1 from a Tetris cart but it started up just as those guys both stated.  Assuming Kevtris is saying that's the default for all versions then he would disagree with Disch who's saying it's only late versions that do.
<br />
<br />I tested MMC1B1 so perhaps MMC1A's start up is unknown.  Maybe we need more testing is needed to confirm...

<br />On all of the those revisions, last bank was switched in at $C000-FFFF on powerup.

<br />MMC1B WRAM by default can be "ON" or "OFF"

<br />1) by default we do have 32kB bank 8000-FFFFh or not?
<br />2) where is default bank located in ROM image

<br />I connected some LED's via 1kOm resistors from GND to CHR A12, PRG16, 15, 14, 13. 
<br />On "power on" with /RESET mapper PRG outputs are flickering.

<br />You need an SNROM board, 256KB PRG-ROM for this test cart. If needed I can include a source too to modify it to CHR-ROM or maybe even test CHR-ROM too.

<br />At least I have a MMC1A devcart, and always placed my reset code here without mirroring it elsewhere, and it worked.
<br />
<br />I think maybe the original MMC1 doesn't have this guarantee, so if you're going to use an original MMC1 maybe it's safer to copy your reset code in each 32kb bank (or even 16kb bank ? if it starts in high 16k swapping mode with a random bank ?).

<br />
<br />What is the input PRG A14???  Without knowing that the outputs flickering doesn't mean much other than PRG A14 is probably "flickering" as well.  Although I would expect it to be stable...

<br />
<br />Yeah you're data is pretty much worthless unless you know what your inputs to the MMC1 are...  Testing in the console is pretty difficult unless you write test roms and burn them onto the cart and such.
<br />
<br />For my testing I used a mcu connected to the cart edge that I could manipulate via USB.  It happened to be the kazzo hardware with my own firmware and software.
