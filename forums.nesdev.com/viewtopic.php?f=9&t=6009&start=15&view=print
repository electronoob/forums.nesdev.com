In most countries where the NES was sold it's easy to find them in auction sites. If it was popular in your country, sometimes you'll even get lucky just by asking about the NES around people you know that were kids back in the early 90's, and someone will just give you one. If the NES wasn't a popular console in your country you can always find a US seller who is willing to ship worldwide. All you need to use eBay and PayPal is a credit card.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">OR can the clone console be "fixed" so that powerpak lite works on it?</div><br />No, they can't be fixed. Clones are just "close enough" replicas of the real deal, which means they are different in some areas, and these details are enough to prevent some carts with specialized hardware that depends on them to not work, including the PowerPak and games using the MMC5 mapper. And like it's been said, the CopyNES does not work on clones.<br /><br />Anyway, if you are serious about programming for the NES you NEED the real console. Clones generate the wrong colors, the wrong sound, and some are even known to have timing issues, so they do not make good testing platforms for NES software.</div>
<br />
<br />
<br />Are there easier ways to find out if a system is a clone or the actual NES\famicom? I mean can there be systems which are exact replica of original NES\famicom in terms of hardware etc?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As far as I know there are no clones that are an exact replica.  Instead of using multiple chips they use a single chip (NOAC NesOnAChip).  It is much cheaper than having multiple chips, but they rely on their own programming and therefore differ from original hardware programming.  The USB CopyNES requires you to desolder the original CPU and attach it to the CopyNES board, so that eliminates all famiclones/NOAC consoles.
<br />
<br />Besides, nothing beats the accuracy and authentic feel of the original IMO.

But whatever firm designed the APU and PPU for the NOAC in common use simply didn't care.

<br />I know you must be a little upset to know that your console is not good for development, but accurate commercial clones simply don't exist, so that's much likely not the case. Like tepples said, it is perfectly possible to make an accurate clone, but no one has yet (at least not for selling).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually there are general-purpose EPROM emulators that will do exactly what you want.  I'm sure there are some decent ones around now, but they've always been kind of expensive and are definitely becoming of old-fashioned by now (when I looked around I see some people use them for hacking their car/engine computer though).  The one I have was made in 1992, it does 8kB to 512kB, I've had it for about 10 years.  It cost me a small fortune at the time, I think almost $200, but was well worth it.
<br />
<br />It's great because with this you can totally ditch NES emulators.  Hell, I've made several unique NES boards, testing code for those on an NES emulator is not even an option.  I also much rather prefer not having to alt+tab around between crap when I could just be writing the code and only have to hit 1 key and look over to see the result.
<br />
<br />Making a devkit that's ALMOST that easy was one of the main design goals of my Squeedo project.  It uses FlashROM instead of SRAM though, so it's slower to upload for the advantage of keeping it's programming  (but you can load to it's 32kB WRAM if you use the right program origin).  I started that project back in 2004, work stalled out while I had other real-life issues to deal with.  But finally this year I will be getting some prototypes into the hands of a few certain developers.  Having more software for it definitely makes it easier for me to put into production.  Unlike the PowerPak, it doesn't emulate mappers, it's a 100% original design.

<br />I configured Gedit on my Ubuntu laptop so that when I press F5 in a project's source code folder, it looks for a  makefile in the parent folder and runs it. The default action of this makefile is to build the iNES ROM and run it in an FCE Ultra window. To go back to the editor code, I need only press Esc.
<br />
<br />Each method has its advantages: yours works for custom mapper development, and mine works on the bus.

<br />
<br />Yup. That's what I use.
<br />
<br />It would be alot neater if it all was contained in a cart though, so you didn't have to mod the NES.
<br />
<br />I know it couldn't do all of the things a copynes can do, but for developing it would do.

The schematic is little more than buffer chips and an SRAM in the middle.  The only special feature is that it has some wire posts for positive and negative reset.  So that can be wired to the reset button for an auto-reset after upload.  I'm thinking I may provide for that if I do a later Squeedo revision.  But JMP ($FFFC) is enough when the program is under control.<br /><br />Single-stepping the hardware would be a mess, it would definitely take some rewiring of the system.  Or better yet, some logic to take over the ROM "Game Genie-style" and output a NOP/wait loop.  I wonder if the PowerPak could do that.  kevtris wrote a single-step mode on CopyNES, it's actually implemented as a 6502 emulator on the 6502.  It certainly works well, but when it comes to disassembling or mucking around with the Program Counter I find that easy to do in FCEU or Nintendulator (because then you've got cycle-perfect video).<br /><br />When I was working on Squeedo there were times when I would take certain values and print hex chars to the screen as sprites.  That worked alright.  Squeedo also has an LED which has been greatly useful as a debug output.  Blinking, toggling, or watching it glow brighter/dimmer depending on the main loop's idle time, for example.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I also much rather prefer not having to alt+tab around between crap when I could just be writing the code and only have to hit 1 key</div><br />I configured Gedit on my Ubuntu laptop so that when I press F5 in a project's source code folder, it looks for a  makefile in the parent folder and runs it.

<br />Yep, exactly.  There really is no tool that will do every job.  I just like having a 2nd monitor to work with, and if it's gonna be NES work then it might as well be a TV with a real NES. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />somehow I managed to get an old(but original) NES console. On its main board "Nintendo 1987" is printed. But the console is in a pathetic state. I will have to do the below to get it running:
<br />
<br />1. redo the controller wiring
<br />2. redo the power switch/reset wiring
<br />3. clean the 72 pin connector.
<br />4. get controllers. I have a controller(for an nes clone) but that has 9 pins in it. Can it be used with the original NES?
<br />5. What should be the current and voltage ratings of the input adaptor for supplying power to the unit?
