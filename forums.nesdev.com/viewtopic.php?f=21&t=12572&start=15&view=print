If you're scrolling a pattern of 8x8 tiles (64x64 pixels, 64 tiles), you need 64 versions of those tiles if you want to animate them exclusively through bankswitching (which is the only possible way if the tiles cover a large area of the screen). This means that this pattern alone will consume 64KB of the CHR-ROM, 1/4 of what the MMC3 can handle. This means the MMC3 certainly didnt do away with such small tile limits when it comes to parallax scrolling, which needs multiple versions of the same patterns.

There is no way the game has that many pattern sets.</div><br />IIRC, the name tables don't change... The background is always made of lines extending from the horizon to the bottom of the screen, and different CHR banks make the lines assume different colors, creating multiple one-dimensional patterns (because each line is the same color all the way). By switching banks multiple times in a frame it creates two-dimensional patterns. To animate these patterns it just changes the scanlines where the switches happen over time.<br /><br />EDIT: Yup, just as I remembered. If you look at the 2 name tables in an hex editor you can clearly see the lines extending from the horizon towards the bottom of the screen. It's all solid areas and diagonal lines separating them.

I was just pointing out the flawed reasoning in &quot;many NES games avoided slopes&quot; =&gt; &quot;not true, because games X and Y have slopes&quot;. Now, we can of course argue until the end of world about whether the reason for the lack of slopes in games was technical (like Sik said) or cultural (like tokumaru said). Probably it was bit of both.
