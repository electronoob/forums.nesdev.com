There were a few things about the C64 version that didn't really translate well to the NES graphicsmode, the metatiles are 3 tiles wide instead of 2 and doesn't always align to 2x2 grid, the screen has higher vertical resolution (240 pixels on the NES, 200 on C64) so there is more space between between blocks. Oh, and Gianas sprite doesn't really look like the C64 sprite at all...<br /><br />Anyway, here is the picture.<br /><img src="http://driar.se/pic/nes/giana.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Hopefully othere people will think this is a fun idea and will post their own mockups in this thread!

Like Apple II tiles, C64 tiles are 14/2 = 3.5 color burst periods wide. NES tiles are 16/3 = 5.33 periods wide.

I was actually thinking about how wide a &quot;wide&quot; c64 pixel was compared to a normal NES pixel, with the higher horizontal resolution and the border and all. Now I don't have to wonder anymore <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Anyways, I spent some time on another mockup, this time it's Rick Dangerous that got NES:ified by me. I didn't do any sprite at all this time. <br /><br /><img src="http://driar.se/pic/nes/rick.png" alt="Image" />

At one point I considered making my game dual NES/C64, but the graphics from both machines are like as far apart as they could be, while one is not technically superior to the other, each one can't (easily) reproduce what the other does. The drastic change in resolution doesn't help at all either. So I pretty much gave up that idea.<br /><br />Even if graphics wouldn't be a problem controller would, the standard controller for a C64 game is the joystick , and you only have 4 directions and 1 button (some have 2 buttons, but they are the same for the software). You could use the keyboard for more buttons, but it doesn't have a D-pad, and requiring the user to use the joystick and keyboard at the same time is ridiculous.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You could probably handle the background by just making two separate tilesets, but that won't help you with sprites (which is where it gets really tricky as sprites have nothing to do with each other between the NES and C64).<br /><br />As for the controller, from what I've read the two button controllers map themselves to impossible combinations of up/down and left/right. The problem is that this means you can't mix button 1 with up or down, and you can't mix button 2 with left and right. Maybe I'm mixing this up with something else but I recall that setup existing.

For Driar I would probably have him always run instead of using up for jumping, but for most games the &quot;up&quot; to jump would be the only &quot;decent&quot; solution. I'm so used to &quot;up for jump&quot; so I don't have a big problem with it, but I know lots of people do.<br /><br />Anyway, another day, another mockup. This time I used the Amiga version of Robocod as my source. This was definitely the mockup that has taken the longest time to make. <br /><br /><img src="http://driar.se/pic/nes/robocod.png" alt="Image" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well my game is top-down view and has no jumping, A is for shield and B for attack. If I was porting this to the C64 I'd probably have to remove the ability to shield, which in turns would make significant changes to the gameplay.<br /><br />You can't shield and move at the same time (otherwise the game would be a pushover <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> ), so pehaps support for those special 2-button joystick could be added. However, I don't know any C64 game that REQUIRES those joystics.<br /><br />The other option is requiring 2 standard joysticks (for 1 player) and use the second one only for the button, to shield. However, that'd be almost as ridiculous as having to press a keyboard key to shield.<br /><br />I don't think UP for jumping is a problem with joysticks, in fact it's pretty much a standard. HOWEVER with a controller, that's a no-no. It's a huge difference, with a joystick you just move your wirst up, however with a controller you should move your left thumb up which is much more tiring and harder to do efficiently.<br /><br />As for sprites, it's without a doubt the worst to port. The best idea is to have monochrome sprites for black (or whathever colour) outline, and use multi-coloured sprite with lower priority for the texture. If a few textured pixels are off it's no major problem, and you even have a 3rd colour to compensate. However, the sprite's size total mismatch between both platform is a major issue.<br /><br />The background is not much better since your working area is 40x25 tiles instead of 32x30, this implies a lot of changes. In fact I came to the conclusion that moving the status bar to the left or right of the screen (to keep the 32x24 tiles &quot;screen&quot; of my game intact) would be the only solution without re-designing the entiere levels.

And since Zelda uses 3 buttons (A, B and Start) this makes it even worse. Golden Axe Warrior managed to get by with two buttons quite decently by only having one action-button and one menu-button but a secondary attack really would have added to the game.<br /><br />I was thinking about going the Golden Axe Warrior route with two buttons - supporting two button joysticks/joypads and make the spacebar act as the second firebutton for players without a 2 button joystick for the C64 (such as myself). Another solution would be to make some sort of press and hold the button to access the menu solution, this is what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhEBshb_VlU" class="postlink">Wonderland</a> does and it actually works quite well. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I don't think UP for jumping is a problem with joysticks, in fact it's pretty much a standard.

I can complete Giana Sisters and Turrican II with no problem. Actually for Turrican II on the Amiga it really makes the game easier since they use the second button (or spacebar for people without it).<br /><br />I would prefer jumping with a button, but since I have been playing this way since the 90s it feels very natural and works well enough.

It plays more like the original <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUxLthm9u_I" class="postlink">SG-1000 Doki Doki Penguin Land</a> - which oddly enough got an arcade port which basically ran on SG-1000 hardware.<br /><br />The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJedH1qpJVg" class="postlink">Master System version of Penguin Land</a> is IMO a lot better and plays way smoother. It's actually considered the sequel and not a remake.
