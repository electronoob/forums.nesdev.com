		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes. Well, sorta. It's still only a 2bpp plane, and that's a bigger thing in terms of visual richness than changing total content.<br /><br />The late-stage advanced mappers often provided eight independent 1KiB banks to control this, allowing for (e.g.) a quarter of tiles to be animated while half were used for fixed background things and another quarter could change as the level progressed, as well as grouped animations on random subsets of sprites.<br /><br />But between the 6502 being an 8-bit microcomputer, and memory and bandwidth on the NES being limited, there was very little pressure to go <em>past</em> 256 KiB of data.

The TMS9928A generates component natively, but has a very fixed palette (15 colors including white and black), and requires an external IC to convert to modulated video. An obvious simplification (and cost reduction) is to avoid the awkward analog frequency doubler and just use some multiple of 3×NTSC to get both the desired horizontal pixel count and colorburst frequency.<br /><br />At that point, they could have used the 2600's analog delay line, but doing the same thing digitally is simpler and doesn't require any tuning or on-die capacitors.<br /><br />On the other hand, I think that it should have been easy to extend the palette in the other direction (the two missing MSBs), though, with more options for saturation and/or brightness.

Colour $X0 is the high voltage for each brightness level, and the corresponding $XD the low voltage, and the PPU makes the colours in between by oscillating between the two voltages with different phases.  Quite smart and interesting.  Maybe Nintendo (Ricoh) could have added a couple more hues in there, but then the hues wouldn't rotate cleanly at 30 degrees(?) for each hue setting.
