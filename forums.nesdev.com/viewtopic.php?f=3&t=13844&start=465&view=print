Greyscale is probably better for debugging in general, and very useful as-is. Maybe there are times where it's worth knowing that a tile really was all-black last time it was rendered too... so I dunno.<br /><br />Ignoring while rendering off is good, though, since it seems trigger bad recolorations very often during fadeouts in various games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah, trying this out and it actually seems to work really well! &quot;Single colour tile&quot; seems like a weird condition, but it does look like it's a practical one.<br /><br />Interesting test case 1: in the second level of Sunday Funday you can switch the lights on and off. Pretty neat to watch the tiles go grey when the lights switch off.<br /><br />Interesting test case 2: in my own game Lizard (or its demo) there's a fade between screens, which will fade the current screen's tiles to black (or now grey), sort of like marking them as inactive, lets me see what's being used in the current scene. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Am I correct in seeing that it picks up tile usage colours for the whole nametable space, and not just the onscreen rectangle? It seems to pick up colours for things in the background layer before they come into view. Originally I had assumed it was only doing it for tiles that are used during rendering. (Not sure if either way would be better or worse, just noting the difference.)<br /><br />Unlike the other CHR viewer options, default palette setting isn't a saved option, always resets to 0 when I restart the program.<br /><br /><br />I suppose one other thing, since I've been trying a bunch of test versions, it might be good to have a build date in the About menu just so I could have a way of figuring out which build I'm on.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yea, &quot;Single color tile&quot; isn't exactly clear, but I couldn't really find any better way to describe it.<br /><br />Your guess is correct - it does use all of the nametable data, rather than what was used during rendering.  This is mostly due to not wanting the feature to have too much impact on performance while the debugger is opened (it's a lot easier/faster to check the ~2000 tiles in nametable+sprite ram at the end of the frame, vs adding logic to every single pixel drawn).   It does have its downsides though, especially if palette or CHR banks are switched mid frame (in which case the results are wrong for the top half of the split)<br /><br />I've fixed the palette/highlight type (only for CHR ROM games) dropdowns so that their selection is saved.<br /><br />The appveyor builds do have a custom build number on each build for this, but they're not optimized with PGO so they are a fair bit (~20-30%) slower than the builds I compile.  Still though, having the build date in general is not a bad idea, regardless of whether it's a dev build or an official release, so I've added it to the about window.<br /><br />There's also a new overlay on the event viewer to show the x,y position (in terms of scanline/cycle) of the mouse cursor (and be able to easily check which events are on the same scanline, etc.).  There's no option to disable it at the moment since I don't think there's a need for one, but if you think it gets in the way, let me know and I'll make it optional.<br /><br />Build: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.mesen.ca/MesenJul29.zip">https://www.mesen.ca/MesenJul29.zip</a><!-- m -->

I didn't quite understand what you were reporting, but I am noticing really strange behaviour with that too now that I'm looking at it a little more closely.<br /><br />At first when I tried creating a b0 label and using it for a conditional execution breakpoint it seemed to work, but I'm getting inconsistent behaviour with it now that I'm trying it after power on.<br /><br />This is what I'm doing do produce the problem. (Am trying it on tepples' 240pee.nes but it should work on any ROM that clears memory at startup I guess.)<br /><br />1. create label b0 that points somewhere (I made it go to $35)<br />2. create execution breakpoint on $8000-FFFF with condition &quot;[b0]==$00&quot;<br />3. power cycle, and debug... breakpoint is never hit?<br />4. replace [b0] with its actual address [$35], then power cycle and debug... breakpoint is now hit!<br />5. replace [$35] with [b0] again, but don't power cycle... resuming in the debugger will keep hitting the breakpoint?<br /><br />So I apologize, you're right, there is something fishy going on there.

There is a slight impact on performance when using labels vs hardcoded values in conditions, but considering it's unlikely you're using a large amount of conditional breakpoints at once, this shouldn't be too much of a concern.<br /><br />@Banshaku<br />Let me know how it turns out - hopefully we can manage to get it running properly on your computer using the SDL windows build.  If we manage to get that much working, it should hopefully not be too hard to fix wine's performance issues with the debugger.<br /><br />@unregistered<br />I'm not too sure what you're referring to when you say &quot;lines on the screen&quot;? I don't recall seeing or fixing anything like it, at the very least..<br />As for 0.9.6, I was initially hoping to get it done over the weekend, but I might have to push it off a few days further still.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&quot;&quot;Lines on the screen&quot; weren't actual visible extra sprites, but there was like a tic-tac-toe grid of &quot;lines&quot; (like 1 pixel width or height of some background tiles were drawn incorrectly and so it made a visible &quot;line&quot;<span style="color: #BF80BF">)</span>.  Thought it was because I rearranged some data, but the &quot;lines&quot; vanished after installing .164 and guessed that might be due to your scrolling fix in .159. Nevertheless, the &quot;lines&quot; have been eliminated!!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Thank you Sour!<br /><br /><br />edit: From what I remember, the &quot;lines&quot; didn't appear when testing with a powerpack on my NES.<br /><br />edit2: And all of the text on the screen, from my lua scripts, appears crystal clear now too.  You continue to do an excellent service for us.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br /><span style="color: #BF80BF">final edit.</span>
