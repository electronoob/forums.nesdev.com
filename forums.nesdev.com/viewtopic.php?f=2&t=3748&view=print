Since the Document is Strictly and officially copyrighted. You must not distribute that doc to anyone or anywhere. Just keep it to yourself
<br />
<br />Since we have the SMB disassembly by Doppleganger, You can make a GB-compatible version of SMB1. With the Document (See above on how to get it) You can convert NES asm to GB asm with both the knowlage of 6502 and Z80 ASM
<br />
<br />Good luck if you are up to it!

<br />
<br />If you are wondering how I got that document, A friend of mine during a EMAIL conversation in 2002 and he was an official Gameboy color developer.and said to not distribute it on the internet. He said to distribute it ONLY IN PRIVATE (in my latest 2007 conversation, since the GBC got discontinued)!

<br />That is not compatible with GB and SuperGB hardware. That is why this is up here: To create an alternative to that version of SMB
<br />
<br />EDUCATIONAL NOTE: (Super)GB should have the same amount of vram as the NES! Of course the palette in the original gameboy is not the same.
<br />
<br />NOTE 2: GBC has more VRAM, Still, this version of SMB1 is to see what happens if (Super)GB Had compatibility for SMBDX. And let us call it:
<br />
<br />SMB1 LITE (AKA OPERATION: COMPATIBILITY)
<br />
<br />Super gameboy is also why i recommended it: There is color support and allows more colors without losing GB compatibility!
<br />
<br />see BALLOON FIGHT GB (a GBC/SGB version of BALLOON KID) for more!

<br />
<br />I played Balloon fight GBC too bad it's only in Japanese! I don't think it will sound like the NES unless you utilize the SNES cpu (for SGB enhanced gamelplay and sound)

<br />
<br />The SGB also uses the Z80 (the Gameboy's CPU) but SNES uses the 65816. They are not compatible and uses completely diffrent opcodes.
<br />
<br />Therefore. you must rewrite it from SCRATCH to do that!

<br />
<br />Why wont you prove it: By downloading the BIOS from internet and create a (Super)GB to SNES converter/disassembler

<br />
<br />Yet another request from Hamtaro for someone else to undertake a large project for no real reason.
<br />
<br />This is getting old.
<br />
<br />Considering the number of requests like this you've had over the years, Hamtaro.  You really should consider <em>researching</em> and <em>learning how to do this stuff yourself</em> so you don't have to pester others.  I can think of 3 crazy requests like this you've had in the past 2 months on this board alone -- let alone all the other places you post.

<br />Sounds like it has trade secrets. I don't think it's a good idea to even read such documents, since any use of the information can put one at risk. Better to do a clean-room analysis, which is completely legal. But that's just my take.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Three video differences:
<br />
<br /><strong>GB vs. GBC</strong>: Unlike GBC, which has 12 KiB of CHR RAM, the DMG/SGB has only 6 KiB of CHR RAM, and the 4 KiB sprite page overlaps half of the background page. So to simulate a 4 KiB sprite page without disturbing the background, you'd probably have to use Battletoads style tile replacement, but that's probably a lot easier on a Game Boy, which has a long horizontal blank.
<br />
<br /><strong>GB vs. NES:</strong> The nametable is always 1-screen mirrored, not vertically mirrored like an NROM-256 or MHROM SMB cart.
<br />
<br /><strong>GB vs. NES:</strong> Another problem might come about because you can only fit 9 SMB1-size tiles vertically on the screen; to fit a usable part of the 12-tile-tall playfield, you'll need to rewrite the scroll registers during hblank.
<br />
<br />The major audio differences between the NES and Game Boy are as follows: <ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>DMG lacks DMC (but SMB1 doesn't use this anyway). </li><li>DMG lacks the bottom 3 semitones of the NTSC NES's tone generator. </li><li>Game Boy hardware square/noise volume envelope is more versatile than NES hardware envelope, but a software envelope produces a slight click every time the volume is written to. </li><li>Only one of the two square channels has hardware sweep. </li><li>Triangle wave channel can be reprogrammed with any 32-point 4-bit waveform while it is silenced. It's possible to play two notes a fifth, fourth, major 3rd, or minor 3rd apart through this if you load in an appropriate waveform. </li><li>Noise frequency control is finer grained, with four values per "octave". </li><li>Looped noise is a different 127-point pattern, with definite C, D, F, and G# notes in each "octave". </li><li>When not played through headphones or TV speakers, the tiny built-in speaker has a strong high-pass characteristic. I have modeled my GBA's speaker in an audio editor as a 3rd order Butterworth high-pass filter with cutoff frequency 800 Hz. </li></ol>
<br />To hear a demonstration (some might say "abuse") of 5 through 8, listen to <a href="http://pics.pineight.com/nes/cheapsmb2underground.ogg" class="postlink">this .ogg file</a>, which I made using a .s3m simulation of the Game Boy audio hardware. The first six bars use simulated internal speakers; the rest use whatever speakers you have plugged into the headphone jack.
<br />
<br />And I thought the DMG and SGB were already heavily clean-roomed. How else would emulators such as NO$GMB, VisualBoyAdvance, and KiGB exist?
