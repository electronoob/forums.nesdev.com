		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi everyone, new guy here.  Sort of a long time lurker though because I've been sittin' on my curiosity concerning NES development for awhile now, and so far I've been able to answer most of my questions using the search function, but now I'm stumped.  I was following the nerdy nights tutorials pretty well, but then remembered that it's a bad idea to jump into game/graphical programming when you're new to the language.  So I grabbed a Commodore 64 emulator and a .pdf of &quot;Machine Language for the Commodore 64 and other Commodore Computers&quot; by Jim Butterfield, so I could start with Hello World and the usual introductory stuff.  <br /><br />So here's where I'm stuck.  There's an exercise in the book that has you get a character from the input stream and display it on the screen if it's a numeric character or a letter, all other characters should be ignored.  I do this by calling a subroutine stored in ROM that gets a character from the keyboard and stores it in the accumulator.  The idea is that if the value in the accumulator is in the range of $30-$39 (ascii 0-9) or in the range of $41-$5A (ascii A-Z), then output it to the screen, otherwise loop back to the top and get another character.  My program excludes $0-29 and $5B-$FF well enough, but I can seem to exclude $3A-$40 (; , &lt; = &gt; ? @).  This is my code, any ideas? (The code uses actual memory addresses for the branch instructions because the book hasn't covered labels yet)<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">processor 6502<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;org $033C<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;JSR $FFE1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; Check run/stop key<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;BEQ $0359&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; Check if z flag is set, return to BASIC<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;JSR $FFE4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; ROM subroutine, Get value from input buffer and LDA<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;CMP #$30&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; Compare value in A to $30<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;BCC $033C&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; &lt; $30 get another input<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;CMP #$39&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; Compare value in A to value of $39<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;BCC $0354&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; &lt; $39, output<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;CMP #$5B&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; Compare value in A to value of $5B<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;BCS $033C&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; If value in A &gt;= $5B, restart<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;CMP #$41&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; Compare value in A to value of $41<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;BCS $0354&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; If value in A &gt;= $41, output<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;JSR $FFD2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; Value in A is numeric or alpha, output to screen (ROM Subroutine)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;AND #$0F&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; Convert ASCII to binary for later exercise<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;RTS&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; Return to BASIC<br /></div>

Is it this?<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;CMP #$41&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; Compare value in A to value of $41<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;BCS $0354&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; If value in A &gt;= $41, output<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />0354: JSR $FFD2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; Value in A is numeric or alpha, output to screen (ROM Subroutine)<br /></div><br /><br />I'm assuming that JSR $FFD2 is at $0354. If my assumption is correct, that's your problem.<br /><br />When the branch is taken, you branch to the subroutine that outputs the character. When the branch is not taken, the jsr to the subroutine that outputs the character is still immediately below the skipped branch.<br /><br />In other words, you have a situation like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;cmp #$41<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bcs label;This could be commented out<br />label:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;JSR whatever<br /></div><br />Whether the branch is taken or not, the code ends up at the same place.<br /><br />But that's just a guess. This is tough to read without labels.<br /><br />Edit: By the way, there seems to be another error.<br /><br />You said #$30-#$39 are valid characters. But the code seems to exclude #$39.<br /><br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;CMP #$30&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; Compare value in A to $30<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;BCC $033C&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; &lt; $30 get another input<br />;If here, A &gt;= 30<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;CMP #$39&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; Compare value in A to value of $39<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;BCC $0354&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; &lt; $39, output<br />;If here A &gt;= $39<br /></div><br /><br />Since it only outputs less than $39 and not less than or equal than $39, $39 is never output. At least, I think.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ahhh, I see it now.  Funny, it seems so obvious now, I guess I'm not used to looking at assembly code.  It makes the obvious  not so obvious, lol.  I had been trying different things and staring at it a good deal, but couldn't see the most basic programming concept in action, instructions are executed sequentially.  Thanks for the help guys =D<br /><br />I think you're right about the cmp #$39 line kasumi, it would exclude $39, but it produces output when I run it, so I think it's because $39 falls through just like $3A-$40.  <br /><br />I know this stuff would be easier with labels but the book I'm using doesn't even cover them.  I only found out about labels because I downloaded a few books.  I think it's because the book has you inputing your code directly into a machine language monitor, so you can easily see the address where each instruction is stored.  I've been using notepad++ and dasm, and then counting bytes forward or back to get addresses.  Not so much of a pain when the program is small, but it does decrease readability.<br /><br />Again, thanks so much guys!!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Using hard-coded addresses is good for understanding what is going on, but you really should just start using labels, or every time you insert code you are going to have to adjust all the labels. You should also setup your system to allow you to trace the code somehow - Use the debug window of an emulator and step through your code and figure out what is happening when your code does something you don't expect.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Using hardcoded addresses is OK for really short test programs, but don't expect to make large, significant programs (let alone games!) that way. Code like that is simply unmaintainable (unless you are Rain Man or something like that - but even if you don't get lost, it will be more work for sure).<br /><br />Also, if your ultimate goal is to code for the NES, I don't see much point in using the Commodore 64. I know you got a book for it, but using system routines which are specific to the C64 and not using handy debug features or even labels (!) will not help much. Might I suggest you try <a href="http://www.exifpro.com/utils.html" class="postlink">Michal Kowalski's 6502 simulator</a> instead? It has an easy memory-mapped input/output interface (so you can still easily use a keyboard and a &quot;screen&quot; if you wish) and has all the debugging tools you will ever need. With it you can see what each instruction does, how they affect CPU flags, the changes made to the stack, and so on. This is how I learned 6502 assembly, several years ago.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I could see the horror of trying to use hardcoded addresses right off the bat, so I'll probably adopt labels.  It seems like an easy enough switch.  <br /><br />I backed up and picked the C64 because I figured I wouldn't be able to easily do my normal newbie programs, that I usually start with when I learn a new language, on the nes without some difficulty. Things like simple input/output stuff.  Even hello world on the nes looks far more complicated than on the C64.  I know they're two different systems so things like prewritten C64 rom subroutines aren't going to help me on the nes, memory locations are going to change, and a whole lot more than that I'm sure.  But, the concepts are the same, as well as the instruction set. And it's kinda fun =) I sorta wanna snag a C64 off ebay now, lol.  <br /><br />I downloaded that 6502 simulator, and I'm going to check it out.  If it's made for the purpose of teaching, it might go a lil smoother.  Having more resources is never a bad thing =)  Thanks!
