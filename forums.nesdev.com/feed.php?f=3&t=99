i've always thought, splitting prg/chr roms would be the best way, like pasofami or whatever. then, you have a text file with all the things needed to identify it, developer, ines mapper number, publisher, prg/chr rom sizes, # of players, etc. which also allows for easy categorization within emulators. i proposed this and stopped it, i called it the "split game pak" format in olafnes.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=79">olaf</a> — Sun Jan 02, 2005 10:01 pm</p><hr />

If all you want to do is extend iNES to recognize mappers better, you might as well just start adding the board name to the end of the ROM (after all ROM banks). Some ROMs already have trash there (some store the game name there), but if a valid board name isn't found at the end of the ROM, the emulator could simply fall back to the regular iNES/CRC recognition routine <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> so the tagged ROMs would work as usual anyway. (Unless there's actually a board named vimm.net <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> )<br /><br />I have given up on trying to make the iNES format work properly so I've built a database with all 'good' dumps in GoddNes and their correct hardware info (PAL/NTSC, board name, mirroring, PRG size, etc). In a future version of Nessie, whenever you load a ROM, the iNES header will be completely ignored if the ROM is found in the database.<br />Thing is, I don't have more than 35-40 carts to check with myself, and the UNIF cart list was rather incomplete, so I had to guess many of the boards <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> Maybe we all could go together and build a more complete list of carts and boards, perhaps Famicom games could be included as well?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12">Nessie</a> — Sat Dec 18, 2004 1:02 pm</p><hr />

I prefer to keep read-only data and read-write data separated as a matter of general principle.  Do you really want an emulator with a bug in it to be able to scribble all over your ROMs?  It's bad enough with FDS where this can't be helped due to the nature of the format.<br /><br />Actually, I wish emulators would implement FDS saving in the form of a diff-like file, rather than by directly overwriting the disk image.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sat Dec 18, 2004 12:52 pm</p><hr />

If you want to redo a new header format, include board names or iNes mapper numbers, but PLEASE not a new set of mapper number. This would be awfull to have two different set of mappers numbers ! Everyone will mix up MMC3 (4 that will be 3) with CNROM (3), etc... Every mapper will have two different numbers ! That'll be <em>awfull</em>.<br />Inculding sram in the ROM file is an interessting idea, but that won't be pratice to download sram files, you'll have to download the whole (and illegal) rom.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Dec 18, 2004 12:06 pm</p><hr />

First, why do you say UNIF is barely documented?  Why do you say it has no place for Famicom boards?  I don't think either of these statements is true.  Also, your question "What is the difference to an emulator..." doesn't address one of the main design decidsions behind UNIF.  While iNES exists only to allow for an emulator to work, UNIF exists to document and archive the cartridge.  When all of the copies of Zelda have rotted into dust, hopefully somewhere will exist a UNIF version of the ROM complete with the manual, scan of the label and box etc.<br /><br />The situation as I see it is this:<br />Nobody is totally happy with iNES.  Not everybody is happy with any of the proposed extensions to iNES.<br />Nobody (as far as I know) has come up with legitimate technical problems with UNIF that can't be easily fixed.  It's only problem is that it has been abandoned, which doesn't have to be the case.<br /><br />UNIF is clearly better than iNES for everyone except the casual gamer who just want to play games.  If we as a develpment community want a better situation, we need to make it happen and not just sit around and wait for the UNIF Fairy to fix everthing.  We need to create a database to support a real iNES to UNIF conversion tool, and stop supporting a format we hate.  Stop making emulators that read iNES without either converting or complaining, and start making development tools that can natively create UNIF files.<br />&lt;/rant&gt;<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29">teaguecl</a> — Fri Dec 17, 2004 2:57 pm</p><hr />

iNes was not very far off the mark.  Most of what it lacked was due to the too-common assumptions and generalizations made.  UNIF is one way to focus on what needs to be emulated.  But the UNIF format is barely documented and has no place yet for Famicom boards.  What is the difference to an emulator between AMROM and AOROM; UNROM and UOROM; NES-MH and GNROM?  If you emulate the latter board in each set, you can run the games that use the former boards.  The sizes of the ROMs can tell anyone in the know the particular board type.  That is why emulators can do perfectly well with mappers 7, 2 and 66 respectively.  For most mapper 1 boards, the SxROM series, there is no real difference in the functionality of each board, only what is on it.  Mapper 1 removes the difficulty of unecessary emulating many, many boards.  <br /><br />By the way, mapper 3 needs a correction.  Even though no board containing a Nintendo MMC3 has hardwired mirroring, boards using Tengen's stripped down Mimic-1 chip do.  Therefore:<br /><br /><strong>03 - Nintendo MMC3</strong><br />0 - TLROM or TGROM (No Save RAM)<br />1 - TKROM or TNROM (8KB Save RAM)<br />2 - TSROM (8KB Work RAM)<br />3 - TQROM (8KB CHR-RAM + CHR-ROM)<br />4 - TVROM (4-Screen Mirroring)<br />5 - TLSROM<br />6 - NES-QJ ('161 submapper)<br />7 - Super Mario Bros. + Tetris + Nintendo World Cup mapper <br />8 - Horizontal Mirroring (Hardwired only)<br />9 - Vertical Mirroring (Hardwired only)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> — Fri Dec 17, 2004 12:53 pm</p><hr />

We could expand the actual iNES format, rather than a new one. In fact, UNIF is by far the most accurate ROM image packaging, bringing everything that really matters in a comprehensive way. Let's avoid this "spinning" and go support UNIF without taking out the "grandpa" iNES format.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=39">Zepper</a> — Fri Dec 17, 2004 7:33 am</p><hr />

Right. It's not a problem with the UNIF format itself, but it's a problem with the lack of proper information in order to make them work with UNIF properly, instead of with ugly hacks to iNES.<br /><br />As for this "iNES Advanced" format, I'm against it. UNIF is by far more semantically correct; from what I could gather, the main difference between iNES and iNES-A is that iNES-A assigns TWO arbitrarily-chosen numbers to a board, rather than just ONE.<br />Furthermore, do we really need a *third* format? We're having a hard enough time getting a *second* format accepted, let alone a *third* as well.<br />And seeing as iNES and iNES-A are mutually incompatible, we'd *still* have to wait for emulators to roll out support for the new format. Granted, it wouldn't be as difficult to update an iNES-only emulator to support iNES-A as it would be to make it support UNIF, but, they'd still have to update their mapper number databases and mapper emulation cores to accomodate it... just like with UNIF.<br />Two mappers numbers may be more accurate; but outright *naming the board* is dead-on accurate. If we're going to go through the trouble to get everyone's emulator upgraded to support a new format, why take only one or two steps in the right direction (with iNES-A) when we could be taking *ten* steps (with UNIF)?<br /><br />With that said, I'll chime in on the issue of keeping SRAM inside the ROM itself: that might be feasable, but, if implemented, it should by no means be made mandatory: as someone mentioned, it won't work if the ROM is on a read-only medium (such as a CD-ROM); it also won't work- at least not very well- if the ROM is stored inside a compressed archive, e.g. a .zip file.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=67">Vystrix Nexoth</a> — Thu Dec 16, 2004 7:14 pm</p><hr />
