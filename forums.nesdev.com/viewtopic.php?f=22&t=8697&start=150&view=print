As for difficulty, it's very hard for me to objectively say anything about it. I don't think that screen is particularly hard, it definitely doesn't require frame-perfect timing. All I can say is that there's always a logical solution, one which doesn't require luck, so if something doesn't work, try doing something different. I do agree however that the difficulty doesn't increase linearly.<br /><br />All things said I definitely can sympathize with you, I remember how frustrating the Flash version was, even on easy mode, when I first played. And now I can run through the whole game in time attack mode in 6 minutes (5 or so is probably possible with a perfect run).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">My suggestion for that part is to move the puzzle such that you eliminate the screen transition, since right now you &quot;start&quot; this section from the top of the previous screen, which feels unnecessary.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Drag, that room was one of two spots I had a lot of trouble with.<br /><br />The key thing for getting past that plus-shaped thing is that if you shoot your cable out, and fall into a wall before it hits anything (i.e. the block on the right of the plus) you'll get a jump to happen. I found this really unintuitive, so that particular spot took me a while to figure out. You want to jump toward the plus-block and shoot your cable just before you would hit the block, and you'll get a jump when it catches.

Grab it again to jump, and curve your jump to the top of the block. Then keep grabbing the ceiling to the left. There's a checkpoint immediately on the other side of the ceiling. There are harder set pieces to time before that, such as that bouncing ball in the column between the two platforms. About four rooms later, when the &quot;lightning bolt&quot; blocks start appearing, is where the music changes to a Jimmy Hart Version of the first area music from Bionic Commando.

It looks really easy to do for the background balls, but do you have any space in the sprite palettes for this?  Bright red death objects is something really bad to sacrifice.
