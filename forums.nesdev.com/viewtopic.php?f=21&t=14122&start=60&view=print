(Search the wiki/forum.)</div><br /><br />Yeah, some emulator palettes will have an extra dark colour for $0D, or rather all the other blacks are raised. A few people like this because their TVs also do something that looks similar.<br /><br />Unfortunately, on a lot of TVs (both new and old) it will fuck up the blanking signals and cause the picture to wobble, or completely disappear. Even if the TV can handle it, on many it won't actually be darker.<br /><br />There's a bunch of possible different behaviours for $0D, really, and a lot of them will make the game unplayable for the user. It really isn't a good idea. (This is why my <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=13264" class="postlink">palette test ROM</a> doesn't show $0D by default.)<br /><br /><br />There's also the two &quot;extra&quot; greys in the $XD column, if you need a few extra levels of grey. These do have slightly different values than the greys in the $X0 column, but some emulator palettes seem to make them identical, which is a little bit sad. Most games seem to just avoid that column anyway, maybe because it becomes an annoying special case for fades.

I don't really see how $0D would help your dark scene.<br /><br />$2D is fine to use, although it will be black in the official Nintendo RGB PPUs (not widely used) and maybe some emulators(?). One more option is to set all emphasis bits to darken the screen further (this, also, will not work on Nintendo's RGB PPU).

But, with The Immortal and some other games using it, I figured it wouldn't be game-breaking or a big deal.<br /><br />If it can be gamebreaking for anyone, I guess better to avoid it.

Other than that, it looks great.<br /><br />Do you have an image of it on your computer though, like a screenshot from an emulator? I want to mess with it to see what you think.

I do believe that I have some space to alter that without having to change one of the heights of the scroll breaks. I might go back and do that. As for the gradient, what's shown is somewhere in the middle of a series of palette &amp; emphasis transitions for sunset, and the colors are heavily washed out on that video. I'm satisfied with that aspect as it is. <br /><br />Edit: as for the screenshot, am on my phone and don't have one immediately available. But I get the gist of what you're saying. Thanks for the offer, though.

We're trying to decide whether it'll be better to black out everything but the cursor, or to use #1D with all the emphasis bits to get that darkened room effect.<br /><br />In the meantime, I've put together a splash screen for the game. <br /><img src="http://66.media.tumblr.com/79df6cf5d3f9a8e81e93853dd15258a1/tumblr_inline_oc32hptOgq1t3povm_540.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />It was really interesting to do this because the KHAN Games logo contains a lot of colors:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.khangames.com/store/img/khan-games-logo-1448407005.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />(I know splash screens are a divisive subject.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sometimes a licensor demands a minimum hold time as a condition of allowing the game to be published at all. Nintendo's <em>Tetris</em> for NES, for example, shows the &quot;Copyright Elorg&quot; screen for a minimum 256 frames, then 256 more frames or when Start is pressed, whichever comes first.<br /><br />And in games on disc-based platforms or games for cartridge platforms using CPU-bound decompression, the minimum hold time covers loading. I've read <em>Super Mario World</em> does a bunch of decompression while &quot;Nintendo Presents&quot; is showing. And behind &quot;MARIO START!&quot; in both <em>SMW</em> and the <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> port in <em>Super Mario All-Stars</em> is a bunch of SPC loading.
