Thats why i posted the links for the conexant chip. It can be hex edited through the bios to output low res, i just dont understand enough of the technical stuff in the manual to decipher what is 240p from it. <br /><br />Im not too keen on this kind of stuff and dont mean to sound noobish, just trying to understand, thats all.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

That's what tepples and I gave you in the preceeding two posts: we just told you how to scale up the NES's 256x240 image to look good when displayed at standard 4:3 480i.<br /><br />The other it how to program the hardware of the Xbox's GPU and RAMDAC to generate 240p output. We've not talked about that ... and now that I look at the links you added in <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=124924#p124924" class="postlink">this post</a>, all the ones that are followed by  … are broken and so I can't read them anyway.

You guys let me know (if anyone is interested) in the above link if you have trouble reading it. <br /><br />Ive spent the last few days studying this datasheet, my conclusion thus far: <br /><br />Conexant is really the only chip capable of doing this with. I have tried messing with nvtv out for xbox but cannot get it to run on linux. For some reason my 1.1 xbox will not run linux the way i need it to to even use this progeram, though it seems that all you can really do it nvtv out is mess with the overscan area or so.

It'll give you the wrong aspect ratio, but at least you'll be able to find out whether you get 240p or 480i output from it. After that, I'd try enabling the NI_OUT bit and/or disabling the MODE2X bit, and see what those do. Unfortunately, this is distinctly going to be in the world of &quot;poke at values until you get what you want&quot;.<br /><br />As far as I can tell, the CX25870 is an all-in-one digital RGB/YCrCb  to composite/svideo conversion IC, so it must have a framebuffer (to store the picture that's sent to it) and it generates an NTSC or PAL-compliant signal. So I think they just took an NV20 core and removed the VGA/DVI outputs, leaving the standard (at the time) S-video/composite video output.

The CX25870's configuration interface should be connected to one of the few I²C busses in the xbox. One'll be the machine's SMBus. I have no idea what kind of toolkit you're working with, but I know that at least xboxlinux has drivers for that: it's evidently the standard nVidia nForce northbridge. The other I²C bus is the video card's DDC ports, the same thing an ordinary PC would use to detect what monitor is attached. Either way, this really ought to be a runtime setting, lest you make the display unreadable for all other purposes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When you say toolkit im not sure what you mean. I work with the official xdk for all emulation on xbox. The problem i have with the xdk is microsoft never added in the use to tap into the low resolution modes so im not sure what i can do there. <br /><br /><br />After searching for a long while, i came across this statement from the guy who wrote the vga bios for xbox: <br /><br />&quot;Unfortunately, I do not have a 'thorough' enough knowledge of the encoder registers used in the XBOX to do anything more than Sync and Color changes. (Sync and Color registers are all that need to be tweaked for the encoder to output the VGA standard. The actual GPU registers need to be patched too, but that is fairly easy.)<br /><br />But, both the Conexant CX25871 and Focus FS454 encoders are actually quite common, and their datasheets are readily available online, so by carefully examining them you could more than likely do this. One thing that will make the whole process easier for you is the fact that the BIOS kernel itself contains the entire register table for both encoders, so it's simply just a matter of using a hex editor to change the registers.<br /><br />NOTE: There is also the Xcalibur encoder too, but that encoder is completely undocumented because Microsoft developed it internally. So far, all attempts have failed to figure out what the registers do, which is why we do not have a VGA BIOS for these encoders, so developing a 'single-field' BIOS would be very difficult for this encoder.&quot;<br /><br />AFter reading through another thread for openxdk,(this is diff from the one i use as it does not move pixels around as fast as official xdk and has not been updated for many years) someone found these values, though im not sure what to do with them or how this will help anything:<br /><br />&quot;these seem to be 240p:<br /><br />0x00f0xxxx<br /><br />and 288p:<br /><br />0x0120xxxx<br /><br />At least we know there is a way to set the output to progressive 15 kHz without any custom video timing. The question is, what if one wants to build his own mode running at 55 Hz for instance&quot;<br /><br />So, in summary we know that:<br /><br />&quot;The Conexant encoder has physical address 0x8A, the Focus encoder 0xD4<br />(logical 0x45 resp 0x6a, one bit shifted right). Some APIs use the physical,<br />some the logical I2C addresses.&quot;<br /> <br />and now i see:<br /><br />&quot;&quot;these seem to be 240p:<br /><br />0x00f0xxxx&quot;<br /><br />so are these 2 linked?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Not directly. Soft15kHz is just a program that overrides the gpu's timing to directly produce an RGBHV RS170/NTSC compliant signal. (This is also trivial to do with linux or anything else that uses xorg.) The xbox's video output is complicated by the addition of the CX25871 which translates from digital RGBHV to composite/s-video.<br /><br />I use this (xorg) modeline to drive an RGBHV NTSC set, derived from the standard VGA timing:<br /> Modeline &quot;1280x240-60&quot; 25.175 1280 1312 1504 1600 240 245 246 262 -hsync -vsync<br />But a significant amount of the visible area is lost to overscan. The pixel aspect ratio is awful (4.1:1), but it's guaranteed to work on ever gpu ever (many no longer support pixel clocks below VGA standard)<br /><br />I also have no idea what routing the xbox component signals take. It's plausible that the xbox component signal might come from a separate RAMDAC.
