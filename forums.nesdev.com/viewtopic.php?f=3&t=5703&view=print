<br />
<br />I think you explained it well but I don't think this is what he's may be looking for <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> I didn't write a post in this thread yet with a similar comment since I saw that the user is maybe not english native since he posted his first message in the chinese forum. So I gave him a break.
<br />
<br />@magicphenix:
<br />
<br />Can you give us more details of what you're looking for?  Do you have an issue with:
<br />
<br />- using an emulator?
<br />- writing code for an emulator?
<br />
<br />your current question is not clear unless you explain the context.  Please give more detail about what you're looking for.
<br />
<br />Are you by any chance the author of the flash based emulator?
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />
<br />He asked a similar question in the chinese forum based on a babel fish translation.  So we should be a little bit more nice with him since he may have problem with english.

<br />
<br />If you're talking about save states, you need to, well, save the state of the emulator in a way that can be retrieved later. This means you have to save all CPU registers, all of RAM, VRAM, etc, so that later the emulator can reload all that stuff and resume it's previous state.
