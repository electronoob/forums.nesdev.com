<br />If you're considering a SNES, I'd humbly suggest you not worry about the hardware at all for now and start developing on the most powerful hardware you can lay your hands on. For one, it'll make your development job easier. And two, by the time it's ready technology will be cheaper; you can always sit on it for a bit if not. A good design will be relatively portable across hardware targets.

<br />I am not sure how the menuing is going to work yet;  I figured I'd just have an overlay that the host CPU can slap on top of the active video using a 10% or 25% transparency.  But the cart label idea is pretty cool I have to say.

<br />
<br />meh.  I already have the hardware designed, built and debugged for the most part.  The target is fixed.  Be that as it may, its abilities are pretty decent and should be plenty for SNES.   16Mbytes of RAM is plenty for the RAM/ROM emulation and the synchronous SRAM is plenty for a screen buffer, SPC700, and PPU RAM.  It should be able to handle some of the expansion chips like the DSPs... probably not enough oomph for SA-1 but the SDD1 might be doable.
<br />
<br />---
<br />minor update:
<br />
<br />I "finished" the NES core I think also.  It supports 211 different mappers right now (that alone's around 5500 lines of verilog,  cartridge audio (yes even VRC7) adds another 2500 or so.  All expansion audio is implemented now (VRC6, VRC7, MMC5, FME7, N106, FDS, drip mapper audio).
<br />
<br />The entire NES+mappers+etc took almost 700K bytes of verilog code in 68 files that I banged out in the last 2 months.  
<br />
<br />It plays all the NES games I can feed it,  all the Vs. games I can feed it (yes, the gun games work with a regular zapper),  and it plays NSFs with an on-screen display doohickey.   
<br />
<br />So, now that the NES part is done, the next part is the host controller that will read the USB controllers,  SD card, and all that fun stuff.  I don't anticipate too many problems here, I'm very familiar with SD and the USB host mode stuff doesn't seem terribly difficult with the particular CPU I chose.
<br />
<br />Once the CPU is running I will be able to enable the DVI video sender and see if that works too.
<br />
<br />Tomorrow my programming dongle will be here, and the CPU is already installed and I think it works.  it doesn't get hot anyways so it's probably hooked up at least mostly correct.  Won't be able to test until I get the programmer.

<br />I'm well versed in the Coco scene and all the products that are available.
<br />
<br />I'm not looking to produce a product that connects to a real Coco. I'm developing an all-in-one FPGA emulation that actually emulates some of those Cloud9 products on-chip. For instance, I already emulate the SuperIDE controller, with full HDBDOS support via CF. I'm just looking to (also) use the SD card as an IDE peripheral, to use on the DE1 for example.
<br />
<br />I have also had Drivewire running on the emulation, but only when using an external 6809. There is no cycle-accurate 6809 core available (yet), so the hand-crafted bit-bash routines in Drivewire won't quite work. Gary Becker got around that on his Coco3FPGA emulation by (IIUC) re-coding parts of the routines. As far as I'm concerned, that's cheating. I want to be able to use the "original" software.

<br />I'm going to assume you're not using an OXU210HP USB host chip!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> Uggh! I'm currently about to start work on an embedded host stack and that is anything <strong>but</strong> simple.

The cool thing is that it is on an FPGA board that I can ultimately "play" with for my retro emulations.

<br />Did you choose a TI chip for the DVI transmitter?

<br />
<br />Yeah it is cheating a bit, but it's kinda hard for the FPGA to load its own fusemaps off the SD card!  I want to be able to reload the FPGA on the fly with different consoles and what not, so that mandates an external CPU.
<br />
<br />The chip is pretty nice, it's a vinculum 2 and it costs around $5 in single quantities.  For that, you get two USB host/peripheral ports,  a 32 bit CPU, some RAM, timers, UARTs, and all that other usual microcontroller stuff.   The best part is the C compiler is free, they have libraries you can use for USB and FATxx and stuff (not that I need it, I already have a complete 6502 based SD+FAT solution but without the FPGA running there's no way to use it) and the programming dongle only costs $16 or so.
<br />
<br />On that FPGA synth I did, there was a 2nd 6502 that ran the user interface.  It worked really well (6502 did FAT and SD and other stuff too) and the DMA unit built into the SD card part made music loading very fast and easy, but writing all that code in asm sucked.   Life is short, time isn't infinite, so this time I really want to try writing the host controller stuff in C on a more modern CPU.
<br />
<br />The NES core right now has an 8K on-chip BIOS that has a simple monitor and ROM/NSF loading and such, but I will eventually move most of the loading part over to the vinculum 2 CPU.
<br />
<br />As for my DVI transmitter, yes it's a TFP410 made by TI.  Hopefully that programming dongle comes today so I can get started on finishing up the timing and video modules then start on system control!  And I cross my fingers that SD card, the pushbuttons and 7-seg display and USB stuff and DVI stuff will work <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />

<br />Ah yes, know it well. Quite simple to set-up. I wrote a small state-machine that drives the opencores I2C master to initialise the chip directly from the FPGA without the need for a processor, though I assume you've connected it to your external processor...

<br />Now that you mention it, I was wondering if the above-mentioned module was freely available?
<br />
<br />The reason I ask is that I'm currently "stalled" on my Coco 1/2 project on the SD part. I need to emulate an IDE <strong>device</strong> using an SD card. My original plan was to complete an SD read/write back-end written in HDL that my colleague had started time time ago. It is using the 1-bit (non-SPI) mode.
<br />
<br />I'm getting a little impatient and have considered using a small soft-core processor instead to do the work. I have C-source to do bit-bash SPI SD accesses that runs on the NIOS, but that's not suitable for my purposes. Something like what you've done would be ideal. So if it is open, could you please point me to it. If not, no problem.
<br />
<br />The early Minimig design had a Z80 doing this stuff, but IIRC it was too difficult to extract just the parts I needed from the design. It was also a little "temperamental" with different SD cards from memory.

And even now that <a href="http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/sdcard/pls/" class="postlink">the simplified spec</a> is available, SD support still "may require a license from the SD Card Association, SD Group, SD-3C, LLC or other third parties." CF, on the other hand, can be accessed as if it were an ATA hard drive, all nice and patent-free. It also takes a bit more glue logic on the reader to make SD's 1-bit or 4-bit protocol work as fast as a CF 8-bit transfer.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The <a href="http://harmony.atariage.com/" class="postlink">Harmony Cartridge</a> (the Atari 2600 equivalent to the PowerPak) for example, uses SD cards for storage.</div>
