We are doing open beta in a couple weeks for Firefall and I have a mountain of work. I get a few hours on the weekend to work on EMUya, but my next big target is MMC5 support. After that is game genie. Then NES emulation is &quot;done&quot; so far as I'm comfortable with the breadth of mapper support for a while. After that Atari 2600 is next on my list.

This is apparently against their new TRC and they don't allow that. Since I can't control this - I can only allow links to sites which do not contain donation buttons on them. Until then I'll disable the button for people who have &quot;donation solicitations&quot;. (personally, I think this is retarded, but I can't control Ouya's policies)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hello ,<br /><br />Unfortunately we can't yet distribute EMUya (1.4.5) on OUYA.<br /><br />Here is our team's feedback. Please consider it. We'd be thrilled if you resubmitted. Unfortunately, the title cannot be passed at this time as to OUYA’s new policy on soliciting donations: “OUYA’s providing a store and ecosystem, through which developers can get discovered by a large, aggregated audience. What they ask in return is adherence to their rules &amp; guidelines. The rules and guidelines exist to provide a consistent and fair environment for all developers. Skirting those rules is not fair to those developers who are operating within the guidelines.” And although the link directly within the App leads to a site that is not asking for donations, some of the links from the “Visit the developer’s website” contain donation solicitations. Please remember that it is your responsibility to ensure that your game adheres to the terms of the OUYA Marketplace Agreement.<br /><br />Our goal is to be the most developer-friendly gaming platform. If you have questions about our process or our feedback onn what you submitted, please feel free to reach out to us at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:app-reviews@OUYA.tv">app-reviews@OUYA.tv</a><!-- e --><br /><br />Team OUYA<br /></div>

Also, another possibility is that the connector pins are depressed in the USB connector on the Ouya. I've heard of that too.

As written Sony owns EMUya and anything else we develop on the PS4 out-right, for free. So, I can't sign the contract they want. However, assuming that we can get the contract issues worked out, yes, it should happen. Also, I'm not sure if they will approve EMUya if it allows side-loaded ROMs. I'll try, but I can't guarantee success. However, all the home-brew games will be available <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

They can't even use the patent excuse since all patents are expired, and there isn't anything copyrightable on the NES itself that needs to be emulated (the only thing that comes to my mind is the lock-out chip, and why would you want to emulate <em>that</em>?).
