<br />atari2600a is right: Supercapacitors are the future. Caps don't last as long as batteries do, but they do take burst charges, such as the power output from regenerative braking, better than batteries. The Nintendo Twist might have a kinetically charged capacitor power supply, much like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanically_powered_flashlight#Faraday_flashlight" class="postlink">shake torches</a>.

<br />Yeah, but currently I guess the most supercapacitors can hold something like 40 fahrrad, that means that they can discharage to 63% of their value on a resisor of 1 ohm in 40 seconds wich is rather good as 1 ohm is nothing. However I guess there is no way to tell what the future reserve to us, probably a lot of good things and a lot of bad things too...
<br />When it comes to the manually charged torches this rocks as you can go without being afraid the battery runs out, however it would be a lot of work to charge a GBA like this if you want to play a decent amount of time, plus this tends to decharge no matter if the light is on or not, so you'll have to always pause your game to recharge. But maybe in the future the new coming gameboys will be so efficient when it comes to consumming electricity that this will be possible. Imagine a gameboy that charges itself as the player shake it when in frustration due to loss in the game...

<br />That's kind of what I alluded to when starting the rumor of "Nintendo Twist". It is rumored that the next handheld will have a pivoting screen (480x272 or 272x480 depending on what the game prefers), with touch across the whole surface, and/or motion-sensing capabilities (like the Wii Remote and the WarioWare Twisted Game Pak). See <a href="http://pics.pineight.com/gbaforum/nintendo_twist.png" class="postlink">mock-up</a>.
