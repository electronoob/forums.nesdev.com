<br />This looks a pretty good way to restore corrupted saves. Although 2 saves with some CRC check would do the trick as well, with the same reliability, since you can restore the data as long as only one save is faulty in both cases, so you'd better store the data twice than 3 times for the degree of security.
<br />
<br />Although I'd rather have a pretty good way to not get them corrupted !
<br />
<br />If the chances of getting a save corrupted is 5% (it actually is almost that high on NES I suspect), the chances that at least one of two saves are safe is (1-(1-5%)^2) = 0.25 %
<br />This might seem OK at first gland but it your save would still be erased in average every 400 play sessions which is still desirable.
<br />I'd consider better invest some $0.70* for more parts and a more reliable backup cricuitery, so that there is like 0.0001 % of loosing the saves, and no need to store the data twice.
<br />In this configuration you'd typically loose data only if the battery is dead or if there is a power shortage at the exact same time you're saving your game.
<br />
<br />* On Futurlec.com, a zenner diode is $0.10, resistors are $0.10 each ($0.30) and a voltage comparator can cost about $0.30
<br />There is also non-voltatile RAM controller chips for $2.75, but there is only one type of them so you never know when they'll stop making them (considering battery backed SRAM is mainly obsolete today with the arrival of FlashROM and MCUs with the sleep ability that can keep their RAM's content intact). This chip would also substitute the SRAM power circuit usually involving two diodes and one resistor (which can be considering costing $0.30, for a total of $1.00, as opposed to the chip which costs $2.75).
