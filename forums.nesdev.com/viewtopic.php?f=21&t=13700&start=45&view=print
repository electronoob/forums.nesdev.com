I'm on hold on doing anything for Vigilante Ninja so I'll work some on the animations for this project in hope it gets to going.<br /><br />I wanted to start with a template for a character. This is what I came up with:<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
			<img src="./download/file.php?id=4953" alt="template1.png" /><br />
			<span class="gensmall">template1.png [ 822 Bytes | Viewed 2545 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div><br /><br />Then I wanted to attempt a punch animation, and my very first step for animation is usually to make some super rough outlines to make sure I get the motion I want. That's the point that I'm at right now and here's a super rough punch animation:<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
			<img src="./download/file.php?id=4954" alt="template1.gif" /><br />
			<span class="gensmall">template1.gif [ 2.41 KiB | Viewed 2545 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div><br /><br />So, I'm hoping to get some feedback before I go further. Any feedback or edits would be appreciated. If there's stuff we want to change about the first frame of the template, better to do that before fleshing out the others.<br /><br />Also, is it worthwhile to have a template or will every character have a unique stance?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It's really a question of which of these options seems best for your situation. There's no actual situation being discussed here AFAIK, so I'm tempted to use one of these ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ but maybe you enjoy the debate, so don't mind me.<br /></div><br /><br />I love it how rainwarrior's post reads like a TL:DR for the whole discussion. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Generally you move your whole body forward a little bit, and step forward with one foot to keep the balance after throwing your arm forward.

I wanted to prove how powerful these old systems are without the things that constrained developers from back in the day, like cartridge size. I mean, I'm not going to be a jackass with it and make really bloated code, but if I had to choose between processing power vs. memory, I'd choose memory. That's why I'm probably not even going to deal with compression, because the CPU will be busy with handling objects, and I like shooters and games like this were the only limit to the amount of objects is CPU time or PPU bandwidth.<br /><br />Basically, I want to see how well the SNES would look if it got the Neo Geo treatment. I don't think that's &quot;missing the whole point of retro game development.&quot;

While all existing MVS/AES cart boards use CHR ROM for sprites and fix layer tiles, these four games render to CHR RAM in real time based on user input. The moving objects in <em>JP</em> and <em>Wolf3D</em> could be drawn with sprite shrinking, but not the walls. But they'd work on Neo Geo CD, which uses CHR RAM, or on a custom MVS or AES board that links the PRG and CHR boards with a ribbon cable and a bus arbitrator that connects CHR RAM to PRG address space during downtime (e.g. vblank).<br /><br />And the Super NES is known for playing music through ADPCM channels. How would that work on the Neo Geo, most of whose ADPCM channels are fixed to 18 kHz? A Mellotron-style setup where each pitch gets its own sample? Perhaps music would still have to sound like Genesis music. Or would you just do it MSU1-style and make the whole soundtrack a single 18k sample?

Star Fox on the SNES is possible, but 1080p video isn't. That's the way I see &quot;possible&quot;. When it's &quot;impossible&quot; is when you actually have to change electrical components inside the system.
