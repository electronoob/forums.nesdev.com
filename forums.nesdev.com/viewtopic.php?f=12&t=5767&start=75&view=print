So $100-$200. It really just needs a very, very simplistic ASIC / FPGA, a little DRAM for buffering, a memory card connector, and a base unit port connector. Ideally a case would be nice, but worst case you can stand the unit on its side, heh.<br /><br />The memory spooler is less complex than LoROM / HiROM mapping logic, the data block access is simpler than the cartridge-loading file system drivers, the buffering needs a lot less DRAM than caching entire carts at a time, the card reader was already needed, the custom PCB -&gt; SNES connector portion was already needed, the register logic is <em>way, way</em> less complex than DSP-1 emulation, the CIC is no longer needed from donor carts, casing was already needed. The only addition is audio output, either over the pins on the base connector port or via an audio out jack that you'd combine with an audio splitter.<br /><br />I don't have much faith that we could ever actually make the device, but we won't know unless we try. Nobody will make it with no software available, so let's start with the software.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Star Ocean apparently doubled in size when the chip was removed but those 4bpp 'traditional' graphics must have been alot easier to deal with.</div><br /><br />Yeah ... that's why I was hopeful it would be more useful.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You do know that CDs are much cheaper than flash (just a few cents per 700MB disc), and a standard CD-ROM drive would only increase the cost of such a unit a few dollars at least?</div>
<br />
<br />A retail DVD-ROM drive is about $30, you can probably find bargain new ones at $15 or so.
<br />
<br />And now you get horrible loading times between scenes and using the device for any kind of reasonable random seeking is now impossible. The disks can be scratched, you can't rewrite them (well, unless it's DVD+RW), etc.
<br />
<br />True, a DVD would only cost $1 instead of:
<br />$9 for SD: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820208507">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.a ... 6820208507</a><!-- m -->
<br />$14 for CF: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820134514">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.a ... 6820134514</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />But I don't expect these to be super high volume devices.
<br />
<br />I'm also curious if anyone would find a use in allowing the data port to write to the devices. I can't think of any practical use for 4GB of writable storage, but if someone else can ... :)
<br />
<br />Anyway, the 21fx thread on my forum or here would probably be a better place to discuss this.

<br />Unless you want to keep all the saves on a battery-backed SRAM inside the adapter, you'll need some way to save and load the state of the player's campaign. Some CD-based games have a campaign of 64 KiB or more.

<br />
<br />This is meant to be a base unit, the actual games are on the cartridges. 4-6MB for your program should be more than enough.
<br />
<br />There's nothing I can do about that. The base unit is an 8-bit bus. You aren't going to be able to map in 1MB of RAM onto it in any useful fashion. That's why I use a data port with fixed DMA transfers to get data off of it.
<br />
<br />Ideally, if something really high end was desired like that, there would be a custom cartridge in addition to the custom base unit. The cartridge could house 4MB of fast NVRAM, a nice ARM9 coprocessor, and some bitmap&lt;&gt;bitplane conversion stuff. That would be more for new development, which I don't expect to see. If you added a BIOS to load in 1MB from the 21fx unit, then people could store the entire games in just the 21fx cartridges and have a nice development system.
<br />
<br />I suspect the base unit will be much more utilized for extending existing games with FMVs and high quality audio. At the very least, that's exactly what I'm going to do with it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I like your idea and understand now your reasoning for Flash like CF cards and think it's great if it gets developed. But I think if it does it would definitely be worth it to develop a "System Cartridge" or two for homebrew games to be made to run just off a Flash Card like a CF. So the System Cartridge would really just need a Boot Strap Program to load some RAM and then I guess some simple bank switching to allow the loaded RAM to be mapped into bank 0 for vectors. And then I suppose if someone wanted to go further they could make a System Cartridge to use with the base unit that contains flexible mapping and a BIOS rom to load roms like the SNES PowerPAK does.
<br />
<br />Anyway I would love to have as an option for a homebrew SNES game to have huge amounts of CF card storage as well as the ability to include music streams as if they were CD audio tracks just being told to play. I hope your idea for the Base Unit proceeds well and you can manage to produce it.

<br />
<br />Compression support went no where, the original plan fell flat because after actually studying the bsnes source it does not advance any sort of internal pointer when reading between writes to 420B or whatever.  Atleast, it seems to look at the size parameter and decompress a big block, then feed the processor byte by byte until size is exhausted.  Then it resets the appropriate bit in $4801.  This is based on addr and addr isn't changing between stores to $420B so the emulator showed the same block of graphics repeatedly, only changing when banks were swtiched or the $4302-$4304 part was changed.  The palette was also attempted to be made out of the same tile data.
<br />
<br />Then I'll just go with the plan of compressing each 'sub block' of data.   A compressed block of data for every frame chunk, or every transfer involved in getting a frame uploaded.  4 for vram, 1 for cgram.  I'd have a working compressed ROM but the compressor causes access violations when I give it a 12800 byte file, the primary size I use everywhere.  The same compressor had no problem with 532KB (or larger) files, no problem with 200 byte files, but 12800 kills it.  I'll try to figure this out tomorrow.

If there is another video presented for this I'll remake it using that too.  The code is pretty much done, swapping audio or video in/out is easy.

No sense bugging you and others further with other sources and encodings and recompression and uploading and all that.

And thanks MottZilla I was thinking the ROM would be immediately shunned because of the whole 64MB deal, but realistically there'd be no way to show off the quality of video/audio the SNES can push without giving it a better mapper.  You can't push the SNES with this by sticking to the original 4MB limit or whatever.  I'm still thinking about the mode7 video ROMs, because that's the only thing that could ever get into a cartridge homebrew but it really does seem like a dead end.  128x64 was barely watchable and the size was awful.

<br />
<br />Unfortunately, I have to agree. If you want to get actual video into homebrew, you are going to have to write the videos as actual programs. In other words, control each element such as mouth movement as sprites, use the scrolling registers, use the brightness registers, use compression, maybe the Mode 7 registers if you can handle 128x128, etc.
<br />
<br />It won't look as good, but I think you can do as good as the Lunar games on the Sega CD, and fit them all into a 4MB game.
