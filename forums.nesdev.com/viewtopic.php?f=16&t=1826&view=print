<br />If you think <em>you're</em> annoyed about the downtime, that's <strong>nothing</strong> compared to how I feel about it.
<br />
<br />The only reason the new NESdev wiki was hosted on my own site is because I couldn't host it here on parodius without having to have koitsu set everything up for me - it was my <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1127" class="postlink">original intent</a> that, once the wiki was set up and working smoothly, it could be moved over onto parodius and the old wiki could be properly decommissioned.

It just detected an invalid CMOS checksum and opted to use a default configuration...<br /><br />[Morvandium] I'm not sure if this will shed any light on the situation, but, here's what the server just spit out after sitting at the login prompt for a few minutes (all in bright white):<br />"F t l double f ult:<br />e p = 0xkernel tr p kernel tr p kernel tr p kernel tr p kernel tr p kernel tr p kernel tr p kernel tr p kernel tr p kernel tr p kernel tr p kernel tr p kernel tr p kernel tr p kernel tr p"<br /><br />I'm going to be leaving around noon today (Friday) and I'll be out of town until Sunday.)<br /><br />[Morvandium] Strange readings in the bios...  I never picked up on this before, but the first set of readings (~80C values) change the moment you refresh...  they're all sitting in the 53C-61C range, which is a lot more realistic.<br /></div>
<br />
<br />For those who aren't aware, the actual messages are "Fatal double fault", interrupted by a long string of "kernel trap" messages (but with all of the 'a's missing), meaning that the server is suffering from some sort of hardware failure.

I also reseated the two CPUs and heatsinks, put on fresh thermal paste, and reseated both DIMMs (one sounded slightly loose). Hopefully, the site should be staying online a bit longer now, but we'll have to wait and see.

<br />Removing one DIMM seemed to make the errors go away, but Morv wasn't able to test the "bad" DIMM before leaving for work; he likely tested it about an hour ago (during which a "The System is Down" page was visible), but I won't know the results until I get home from work (in about 5 and a half hours).
