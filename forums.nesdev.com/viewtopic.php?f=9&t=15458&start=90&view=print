		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You're transforming the banding into dot crawl by using a crystal for color carrier frequency. The banding is fixed because it's generated by the same clock as the video (the color carrier coming from the VDP is synchronous to the horizontal sync).  By switching to a free-running oscillator you have the interference drift around the screen, usually from left to right (may vary depending on the adjustment of the circuit, if there's any or the ambient temperature).<br /><br />The NES has some measures on the PPU to diminish the effect of the banding/dot crawl artifacts. SEGA stuff not.

The dot crawl is still noticeable even on S-Video, particularly because it has motion, while the banding is static. <br /><br />The motion can be distracting for some people. That is the main reason why it's preferable to keep the banding than &quot;upgrade&quot; to dot. crawl...<br /><br />To get rid of dot crawl AES NEO-GEO have a complex circuitry with a PLL feeding back clock fluctuations from the 3.57Mhz oscillator at the CXA1145 IC into the 24MHz oscillator which clocks the system. Any fluctuations on the color carrier frequency are compensated on the main VDC (Video Display Controller) making sure the clock which generates the horizontal sync keeps in phase with the chroma carrier.<br /><br />Playstation (the first one) in addition to keep it's chroma carrier in phase with the horizontal, feeds a triangular wave to it's CXA1645 instead of a square wave, further reducing image artifacts on spots where colors change abruptly.

They put it mostly at the points where ICs and sockets are soldered to. I suppose that helps out when you need to remove them from the board.
