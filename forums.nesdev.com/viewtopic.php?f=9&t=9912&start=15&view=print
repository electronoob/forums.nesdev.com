The post did mention that glitches were going away when they sprayed it with freon to chill it (and that it was only on some specific revision of the NES).  So I wonder if putting a heater on the PPU, if one could make it happen with any NES, heheh.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />3gengames: That depends on whether Visual2A03 accurately emulates the physical causes of this problem.<br /><br /><br />Anyhow, I have to take back what I said about my example. I have now been able to get my program to run on my PowerPak Lite just fine. The problem was that I was writing my OAM before I wrote the nametable. By making sure the OAM write loop is the last thing I do before turning on rendering, it now comes up consistently (and will remain stable while rendering is on for as long as I've tested it, currently going on 20 minutes).<br /><br />I dunno why it worked okay on my PowerPak earlier. Maybe it was just a cold day? (It's currently out of commission so I can only test with my PowerPak Lite at the moment; I am in the middle of making some modifications I have been putting off.)<br /><br />According to FCEUX's cycle counter, the nametable write took 15422 clocks (~9ms). I suppose the OAM must be really sensitive to degradation then, more than most DRAM? I guess it at minimum it has to be able to survive vblank + a little bit of overlap (enough time to write 64 bytes to $2004?), maybe it really is starting to degrade after just 9ms.<br /><br />Edit: after further testing, even this is not quite enough! See below.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wow, after testing a bit more, it sometimes even degrades if the OAM write loop is the very last thing I do! It looks fine most of the time, every 3 or so resets I will be missing 1-5 sprites, I think always from the lower index (I've verified each of sprites 0-4 missing at least once after a reset, most often it is sprite 0 or 1).<br /><br />The $2004 write loop (lda/sta/inx/bne) takes 3466 cycles (~2ms) until writing $2001 to enable rendering. I guess that's a bit longer than a vblank (~1.3ms). Wow, can it really degrade that fast?<br /><br />Did someone say this problem doesn't exist on the PAL PPU? Did they have to re-engineer it to fix this because of the much longer blank time?<br /><br /><br />I guess an unrolled (lda immediate / sta) could probably write all 256 bytes in time, though it'd be more sensible to create an aligned block of data and DMA it, to save space (and cycles). Given how narrow the window seems to be, you might still have trouble if the end of your loop occurs near the start of vblank.<br /><br />Maybe it would be good advice to suggest only writing OAM during vblank (when rendering is on), so you can ensure that you never miss your refresh window. From my tests there is no need to write OAM every frame, but just getting the data in there reliably before turning on rendering seems really tricky without doing it in vblank.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A few days ago, I was testing something in visual2c02 and saw some very strange behavior, but after thinking about it for a while I may know what's going on:<br /><br />The oddity I was seeing was that writing to $2003 would seemingly <strong>copy</strong> 8 bytes from the previously selected sprite &quot;row&quot; (00-07, 08-0F, 10-17, etc.) to the newly selected row. This turned out to be because my sprite RAM wasn't actually initialized with any values at all - every cell has two transistors, one to store &quot;0&quot; and one to store &quot;1&quot;, so if a cell goes too long without being refreshed it will end up with &quot;no value&quot; in it, causing it to inherit values from another row if the sprite RAM address happens to change during the 'refresh' phase (as opposed to the 'bus precharge' phase).<br /><br />Initializing all of sprite RAM with constant values caused this glitch to go away in the simulation, but it's very possible that this is exactly what's happening on the real chip when you write to $2003; when SPR-RAM increments on writes to $2004, it likely happens during precharge to avoid this glitch, so one possible way of 'safely' reading back sprite RAM might be to read the value and then <em>immediately write it back</em> so that the address increments at the right time. This might also explain the phenomenon of writing to $2003 post-DMA causing different sprites to be used for #0 and #1 (though that would seem to be an instance of values from the new page leaking over to the old page as a result of both rows being enabled at the same time, something which technically shouldn't happen).

I feel like something connected on the PowerPak cartridge that's not the same when using the PowerPak Lite somehow makes the OAM more stable. Very odd.

In an earlier version I initialized Y[foo]:=(foo&gt;&gt;3)×24+28, but that showed different weird behavior (the sprite &quot;O&quot; would flicker as I slowly filled up the OAM with &quot;good&quot; data as it exceeded the 8 sprites per scanline limitation). This version pre-fills OAM with all $FF before the interactive portion starts.<br /><br />On an emulator (and on a 2C07?), the only shown effects are the known &quot;sprite 0 and 1 instead render the sprites pointed to by OAMADDR an extra time&quot;. On my NES, I get these effects-<br />* Almost always, only the latter half written to of any given row of OAM shows. So if I step through the OAM forward, only even sprites appear. If I step backwards, only odd sprites appear. Except:<br />* Sprites 8 or 9 are usually copied into Sprite 6 or 11, the opposite of the direction I step (i.e. if I step through it as 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 10, 9, 8, I can move 8, and there's an extra copy of the sprite. When I finally step back to sprite 6, the duplicate disappears. If I go the other direction, 9 is copied to 11. At least once, I'd seen sprites 8 and 9 made triple, but I haven't been able to recreate it with this test.)<br /><br />This test can be accurately emulated as ... well, really, anything with CHR-RAM. I've used it on mapper 218 hardware, and emulators as 0, 7, and 218.<br /><br />I'd like it if other people could test it in their own hardware, just to make sure I'm not exceptional.
