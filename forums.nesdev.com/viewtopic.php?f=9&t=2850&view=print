		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Recently i built my own version of a NES to PC conversion (permanent, although a reversal could be managed it just would look good at all). I wire up the controller as you usually would to the parallel port, and stole the ground and power from a USB port. I am using PPJoy, and the controller is accepted by the PC. My usb port seems to be putting out 4.5 volts (that should be enough, at least for a response) (and thats after passing the diode). My problem is, the A button is the only button that works. When it is depressed the controller reads that all the buttons are being pressed. I read about a similar problem but no solution was given. (below)
<br />
<br />-QUOTE-
<br />I bought the RetroKit and soldered everything. My computer recognizes it and I can select it in the Game Controllers panel. The thing is NONE of the buttons work EXCEPT for the [A] button which when pressed the computer acts as if all the buttons are being pressed simultaneously.
<br />
<br />This person has the same problem I do, but i did a parallel port version. I've already cut all the cables so if anyone has a suggestion as to how to get this working correctly, and input is appreciated.
<br />
<br />Also, sorry if someone has posted this before I attempted to search through some of the topic boards but NES is such a popular term in any of the boards.
<br />
<br />I also pulled some sort of a similar problem with a soution which i think the guy may be confused, but who am I to say.
<br />
<br />-Part of an FAQ <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.zero-soft.com/HW/USB_NES/index.php?page=6">http://www.zero-soft.com/HW/USB_NES/index.php?page=6</a><!-- m -->
<br />“I don't want to put this in the controller, I want to put it outside and have the original NES controllers plug into it. What do I do?”
<br />
<br />Awesome. I wanted to do this initially as well; however, I was unable to find the connectors for the NES. Sure, you can salvage them from old NES consoles, but I don't have a bunch of consoles lying around. Anyway, the procedure is the same except you need to do one additional step since the controller will not always be NES controller won't always be connected. You need to solder a 100k resistor (no, it doesn't have to be 100k, but it needs to be large) from the yellow wire (VCC) to the white wire (Data). This pull-up resistor will keep the input high if a controller is not attached. If you don't do this, the buttons will always read ALL on, which can be a tad bit annoying.

<br />and it the the A button only, not the down up select or B button (only the A seems to function at all.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />if it is the clock signal, anyone have suggestions on fixing it? A 4021 shift resistor runs cheap (30-50 cents), but would i be able to interface it in an Nes controller?
<br />
<br />On a side note, my buddy picked me up a controller off Ebay so i may attempt the USB version with this one, the 4021 chip isn't needed in that mod.
