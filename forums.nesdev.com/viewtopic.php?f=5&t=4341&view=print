		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was talking to one of my coworker and this discussion came by.  We know that Capcom will make Megaman 9 to look like a nes game, which is cool but it's not the real thing.  So what if a new real nes game would come out?
<br />
<br />It could be distributed in an emulated form trough wiiWare, Xbox arcade and Sony psn store for the people that don't have the hardware anymore BUT for the one that do, the game could be produced on a real cart.
<br />
<br />If the idea would take off, I could see many possibilities coming like producing hardware again, continuing some franchise that never had any sequels, providing a way for home brew game to be published  etc. Many possibilities indeed.  
<br />
<br />The interest in retro gaming and simpler games is becoming bigger and bigger so I think there could be a market for it.
<br />
<br />Since the nesdev community really enjoy the nes, I would like to have your thoughts on the subject.  It may only be a dream from someone that always wanted to produce software on the previous generation of console but who knows were a simple idea could go.

I think I remember people saying they tryed something they made on a famiclone and it worked but could not get it to run on the real thing but I could be wrong.
<br />
<br />Maybe some day I might dump one and try to run it on the powerpac although I may be too stupid to firure out the addresses on a glob top conneted to a differint glob top when I don't know the pinout of ether.
<br />
<br />
<br />anyway I would definatly buy new NES games if they were produced and I am going to buy megaman 9 when it comes out.

<br />
<br />Sorry if it was interpreted the wrong way. My comment was related to Mega man 9 which is not a real nes game but just wants to look like one on purpose.  I think since Capcom took the risk to release a game that way, it will be interesting to see how well it sell.
<br />
<br />Of course the ones you mentioned are real nes game, that would be an insult to say otherwise.   But one of my dream, if I can ever make it happen, is that I would love if those games could have more exposure and become common again.  If possible, not only the nes, but on any platform that people still have an interest in it.
<br />
<br />If you can "revive" some of those platform in the eye of the public and create interest, maybe you could motivate some bigger company to create some product again.  
<br />
<br />I see some people prefer the real thing (and I do), but the reason to be able to distribute it on a channel like WiiWare or xbox arcade is to create exposure for the product.
<br />
<br />I have some ideas on my mind, don't know if I will be able to realize them or not, but it good to see opinions from everybody.

<br />
<br />I agree with this... I find it annoying too. 5 years ago I could buy a Gradius II for 1000 yen at Akihabara. Now you're lucky if you can get it at 3500 yen.  Recently with the retro things that many people seems to have taking an interest in (especially the pokemon generation that wants to buy them all...) many carts that were at an acceptable price became higher. 
<br />
<br /> If I could revive a platform, it wouldn't for shooting out "retro is cool again!": I just want games to be made again for the platform I like.  And if it could become viable, I would love to republish some game to make them available again at an acceptable price and in good condition. But that part, I guess I'm just dreaming..

<br />Couldn't agree more with that !
<br />
<br />Also, the who can tell how good the games sold at retrozone work since you can't download ROM from them ? Who would risk spending more than $25 for a game that have high chances to be complete crap ? And what is the point to buy NESnake $25+port when I can make it for about a tenth of that price (not counting the initial investisment of an EPROM programmer) ?
<br />
<br />Also, I prefer games being released free and emulated (allowing anyone to build their own cartridges) than to have them paying (until I can find it at my local game stores which most likely won't be the case).
