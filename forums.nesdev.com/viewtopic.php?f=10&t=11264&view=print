		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Im assuming this is called vram buffering.<br /><br />Anyway, my rom hack of The Legend of Zelda, i inserted a working 2 digit counter for Links arrows. The vran starts at $302, and its constantly updates Links heart count, rupees,bombs, &amp; keys counts.<br /><br />I was able to insert my custom counter at the end of what normaly was the end of the vram for Links items status.<br /><br />Currently from $302, the size of all the bytes being loaded is 2C bytes in size.<br /><br />I use fceux as my rom editing emulator, and everything appeared normal.<br /><br />A guy who is trying my work on an actual nes, sent me a video showing my counter all screwed up. I tried my rom in Nestopia, and it displayed fine. But, i tried it in Nintendulator, and it appears messed up, and it even clips into my b/a boxes.<br /><br />So my question is, is there a way for the vram engine to accept the slightly increased size of tiles to write during this update, or is there a definitive size limit on what the nes's vram can handle during a vram buffer update?<br /><br />Thanks! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There is no &quot;VRAM buffer&quot; inherent to the NES - what happened is that your extra code caused the game's VRAM update routine to take too long and spill into the rendered part of the frame, resulting in graphical corruption (because of signal conflicts within the PPU). There's no simple solution to this problem - if you're adding new VRAM update data to each frame, then you'll need to make sure the game's code is fast enough to handle it, but that might be tricky since NES games were typically fairly well optimized to begin with.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, it sounds like your code that draws the new thing is running outside of vblank (many emulators don't bother to simulate the problems this causes). Put a breakpoint on it in a debugger and see when it's being executed (look at the scanline/pixel counters in the debugger). Get it to run inside of vblank somehow.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The vblank code in RHDE consists of several different BGUPs (<strong>b</strong>ack<strong>g</strong>round <strong>u</strong>pdate <strong>p</strong>rocedures). For each type of data prepared in the transfer buffer, I have a BGUP that copies it to video memory during vblank. And then I have a scheduler that looks at what game data is &quot;dirty&quot; (in need of an update), generates data to be copied, and sets the BGUP for the next vblank. So all the game loop really needs to do is call the BGUP scheduler once a frame. Does Zelda have anything similar?

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think zelda is very similar to super mario brothers, which is a simple VRAM buffer such as: PPU address, length, data, data, data..<br />It can also be overridden with a variable to do standard palette updates or display text messages instead of looking at the buffer. Normally when this would happen (always?) there would be nothing in the VRAM buffer anyway.
