Maybe d4s was referring to the SEEK registers. Or maybe d4s was actually referring to ALL registers, and he wasn't aware about volume compatibility issues. In latter case, I can't understand why anybody has followed that advice.<br /><br />Timestamp for the &quot;demo.sfc&quot; engine is February 2011. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://mega.co.nz/#!RlcUWbIZ!NSb2LGDXM3BDSa_S6chwpEA19w0nMskEIgFeAu6aGU0">https://mega.co.nz/#!RlcUWbIZ!NSb2LGDXM ... gFeAu6aGU0</a><!-- m --><br />Timestamp for the &quot;demo.msu/pcm&quot; files is March 2013.<br />That might explain why byuu claimed that &quot;Akira demo did not yet exist.&quot; <br />In case byuu has ever looked at those timestamps at all.<br /><br />This is getting surreal. I was basically wanting to emulate that msu mapper and the msu programs. Which has been looking like a simple 2-3 days project. And now I find myself looking at bloody timestamps in order to figure out what went wrong at which time. And after all, it doesn't matter...<br /><div class="quotetitle">byuu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If <s>we</s> <em>you</em> want productive dialogue, then <s>we</s> <em>you</em> need to agree now that <s>the</s> <em>my</em> specification supersedes everything else.</div><br />EDIT: Sorry about editing your definition of a productive dialogue. In case of the volume you <em>have</em> changed your specs. In all other cases such like the sampling rate issue: I have never said that I disagree to your specs. I have only mentioned that sd2snes is using a different design. Which is a problem, and which isn't your fault, and I can't see why you are getting so angry.

These statements annoyed me:<br /><br />&quot;The MSU1 audio feature is totally useless if we can't agree on an official sample rate&quot;<br />&quot;You have changed the official initial volume setting at least three or four times.&quot;<br />&quot;But for emulators, it appears to be better to set volume=FFh for compatibility with programs that are lacking initialization&quot;<br />&quot;At the moment I am considering to support both .pcm and .wav for backwards compatibility.&quot;<br /><br />By all means, if you want to make your own specification, you're welcome to. I can't force you to follow the spec I have designed, but I hope that you will.<br /><br />Like you said, it's an issue that sd2snes is using 44308hz. Yes, I was wrong in my initial assessment that this was a minor difference. It's bigger than I thought when I did the math on it. But it's an example of why we all need to do the same thing. We can't have each author doing their own thing, or the software won't be compatible.

Maybe it was unfair to count the latter two as &quot;changes to the specification&quot;. From my point of view, when trying to figure the initial volume setting: it did really seem as if the volume were changing day by day (first I stumbled through your three conflicting definitions, and then I ran into the conflicting akira and sd2snes implementions). There is definitely some sort of a mess, and it was really hard to figure out what is going on with that register.<br /><strong>appears to be better to set volume=FFh for compatibility</strong> - that was meant to be a constructive suggestion for maintaining backwards compatibility &amp; compatibility with sd2snes, and I was really thinking that it would be a good and simple solution without any negative side effects (at that time I wasn't aware about that Skrillex demo).<br /><strong>I am considering to support both .pcm and .wav</strong> - that was annoying you?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&gt; Thanks for the link. Don't know if it's worth emulating it... is it some sort of long lost masterpiece?<br /><br />It was the initial prototype prior to MSU1. I really liked the name a lot more, too. The idea back then was to allow it to work on the SNES expansion port (B-bus.) But we didn't want to require special cart hardware to allow direct transfers from 21fx-&gt;PPU VRAM, so we changed things to run on the A-bus.<br /><br />Also took ikari's advice in mind that the shift register system was likely to prove more difficult to implement in hardware, and expanded the register layout from three to eight registers.<br /><br />&gt; I hope I got right: The Skillrex demo is another MSU1 program, isn't it?<br /><br />It doesn't exist yet, but it could easily be made. It's why we don't want two implementations to behave differently.<br /><br />&gt; and twice in this thread<br /><br />Yes, that was my fault. These changes took place in 2011. I don't have the best memory, so I made a mistake in writing, but the source code implementation remained the same and correct. Initial volume in early 2011 was 255. Volume in late 2011 was changed to 0. That was the only time it actually changed.<br /><br />&gt; that was annoying you?<br /><br />Only a little, because it may lead to fragmentation (WAVs are certainly easier for casual users to produce.) This one's really tough.<br /><br />The MSU1 register interface and expected behavior is very well defined.<br /><br />But when it comes to naming files and music formats ... this is a real toss-up. I really don't know how to make a universally compatible format here. Some people are going to want to distribute music tracks as MP3 or OGG. Some are going to want to distribute the movies as AVIs that are decoded and stored into the MSU1 data file. Some people are going to want game folders for higan/bsnes, some are going to want game files for other emulators.<br /><br />Technically speaking, you can add support in no$sns to play a 96KHz, 24-bit, 7.1 surround MP3 file for a track. If that music file is present, it will work just fine with any MSU1 game. But that track won't work in higan or sd2snes. The same is true of a WAV track.<br /><br />And with higan/bsnes, I really like my manifest system, which lets you specify the filename of each track. Let's say you're a casual user, and you want to swap out audio tracks with alternate selections (ocremix has dozens of versions of the same songs played on different instruments, for example.) Which of the following would be more intuitive to you?<br /><br />Option A:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Legend of Zelda, The - A Link to the Past-0.pcm<br />Legend of Zelda, The - A Link to the Past-1.pcm<br />Legend of Zelda, The - A Link to the Past-2.pcm<br />Legend of Zelda, The - A Link to the Past-3.pcm<br />Legend of Zelda, The - A Link to the Past-4.pcm</div><br /><br />Option B:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Track 01 - Opening Credits.mp3<br />Track 02 - Boss Battle.mp3<br />Track 03 - Overworld Theme.mp3<br />Track 04 - Dungeon Theme.mp3<br />Track 05 - Ending Credits.mp3</div><br />(no, I don't support MP3s. It's an example.)<br /><br />But option B forces people to use my manifest files in BML format. So it's probably not going to happen on the sd2snes.<br /><br />So I really don't know what to do here.<br /><br />This has already been a problem. It's why Super Road Blaster doesn't run directly on the latest higan release.<br /><br />We need to absolutely standardize on a system here, humbly ask d4s to update his download page, and make the standard the required distribution model. But that's going to be a topic that is highly contentious and goes on for months.<br /><br />The only thing I can think of is to make a really fancy tool that takes the input data in a variety of supported formats, and you then choose to produce a working copy of the game that runs on a given implementation: be it higan/bsnes, no$sns, or sd2snes. This tool would need to run on Windows, OS X, Linux and BSD at a minimum.<br /><br />There's just no way sd2snes is ever going to play back that hypothetical 96KHz 7.1 surround MP3 directly, nor any way higan's ever going to run a game without a manifest board description.

But just to push this a bit more:<br />- Akira exists, and works on sd2snes, but doesn't work with volume=00h.<br />- Skrillex doesn't exist, but if it would exist, then wouldn't work with volume=FFh.<br />- All other existing games/demos work with either volume setting.<br />Of that two initial settings, I would still vote for the one that is compatible with existing software.<br />I am not saying because I voting against your specs, or because I am voting for the sd2snes implementation.<br />I am just voting for the variant that appears to be more user-friendly.<br />Any chance that you could consider that idea?<br /><br />I would like to stay compatible with higan and sd2snes implementations, and also would like to stay compatible with that demo.

And now we have a .pcm version of that game, I am not considering .wav support any longer.<br /><br />For now I would recommend staying with the existing .pcm and .msu files without compression. If there are hundreds of MSU games at some point in future then it might be worth to go into compression. Although at that time, internet may so fast that nobody cares about 4GB downloads. On a side note: At that time people might use movie demos that are longer than 2 minutes. So sample rate should be accurate enough for longer movies (of course within reason, a quartz inaccuracy of 1 second per day or week would be rather irrelevant).

The idea is that I'm going for lossless compression, but keeping the filesize down somewhat. Distributing the .pcm files, especially with my music (which sometimes exceeds 10 minutes), can go into the gigabytes. As a matter of fact, it'll probably still be up there in the megabytes (mainly because of the number of tracks I might end up making for the game... as well as perhaps several different settings for MSU1 usage that I can implement into one game), but it's somewhat more tolerable.

And it's also more complicated to say &quot;all regs default to zero EXCEPT volume which is 255&quot; than it is to say &quot;all regs default to zero.&quot;<br /><br />I'm really having a hard time understanding why it's such a big deal to stay compatible with a single tech demo. ikari said he was going to release an update that sets the volume register. Nobody is actually using that tech demo ROM.<br /><br />You know, the Power Slide FX demo doesn't work unless you initialize SRAM to 0x00. I don't have a special case in higan to run it. It remains broken, because it is broken by design. If the battery fails on that proto cart and you replace it, the game won't run anymore. We don't have to have 100% perfect compatibility.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">- detect the old demo.sfc engine and switch to a pre-MSU1 emulation mode for that specific movie player.<br />- detect any msu games that play audio with uninitialized volume and display an optional &quot;this would work only on older MSU1-implementations&quot; warning message.</div><br /><br />Both of these sound like very good ideas to me. I hope they wouldn't be too much trouble to you.<br /><br />&lt;nocash&gt; And now we have a .pcm version of that game, I am not considering .wav support any longer.<br /><br />Yeah, so let's do the same with the Akira demo.<br /><br />&lt;nocash&gt; For now I would recommend staying with the existing .pcm and .msu files without compression.<br /><br />I definitely think that's how all emulators and hardware implementations should run the games, no doubt. Requiring an emulator to contain multiple video and audio codecs is completely unacceptable.<br /><br />The idea is that you would combine: compressed download + my special program (maybe distribute them together as one download), and when run, it spits out a game in .msu + .pcm format that all of our implementations can play. It also handles the manifest / game folder / filename differences.<br /><br />My only concern is that people won't share a CD-audio game patch that requires a 700MB download, but they are much more likely to share one that requires a 20MB download.<br /><br />&lt;nocash&gt; On a side note: At that time people might use movie demos that are longer than 2 minutes.<br /><br />True. It also has to exist. I think the most common use case now is bringing over anime intros from SNES ports.<br />Like this video: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_jXf7FHGA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_jXf7FHGA</a><!-- m --><br />It adds the PS1 port's FMV into the SNES port. The nice FMV sequence with no loading delays.<br /><br />&lt;KungFuFurby&gt; I personally was considering not distributing raw .pcm files, but instead make two .flac files for each piece of music (opening and loop) with some exceptions<br /><br />Well, on the opening + loop part ... the way that works with PCM is nice and easy.<br /><br />Combine the two files, and set the loop sample# to the total number of samples in the opening song.<br /><br />If you want them separate and write a conversion tool to turn this into PCM, that's fine I suppose.<br /><br />I am just hoping that whatever formats and whatever converter ends up being used, is available on every major platform. I run FreeBSD, so if you distribute a game in FLAC only, I'd have to write my own converter to run your game.<br /><br />I definitely understand nocash's concerns here, but I think people are going to distribute compressed files whether we want them to or not. It's probably better for us to do it right than to have several ad-hoc, Windows-only converters. (not saying yours would be Windows-only, but in general most would be.)

The Akira demo can be patched to run on the present spec, just as any console's launch titles were when they and the console were being developed in parallel. I'm told the code in Tetris for Game Boy is convoluted because of having been developed on prototype hardware and adjusted for the real thing. And given that ikari has promised such a patch, as byuu mentioned, we can scratch this off the list of objections.<br /><br />Is Power Slide FX's problem the same as Mario Adventure's?

I run FreeBSD, so if you distribute a game in FLAC only, I'd have to write my own converter to run your game.<br /><br />I definitely understand nocash's concerns here, but I think people are going to distribute compressed files whether we want them to or not. It's probably better for us to do it right than to have several ad-hoc, Windows-only converters. (not saying yours would be Windows-only, but in general most would be.)</div><br /><br />I myself don't use Windows by default (so far, I use it as a debugger for safety reasons). I'm actually wondering what lossless compression formats would be a good idea... my first instinct is FLAC, although I'm open to other formats.
