If all the games use simple mappers (NROM, CNROM, UNROM/UOROM, AMROM/ANROM/AOROM, BNROM), you could use a mapper 28 cartridge with the Action 53 engine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, is the OP asking about SNES or NES multicarts?? It's very hard to answer both at the same time. Either way I believe NES has been answered well enough already, so I can say SNES idea is essentially the same. One of the easiest ways to do a multicart is by switching it by reset and you can do the same for SNES games, although you can't mix &quot;mappers&quot;, so you can't mix Lorom with Hirom games (just easily) on 1 cart. You should also keep in mind whether your games use SRAM save, although this is also doable to install a bigger SRAM chip and switch it the same way as program chips so all games have independent save files

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Or if it can be more expensive but also alot better, try SD2SNES.<br /><br />Making multi carts of SMW Hacks (I assume that's what you want) wouldn't work out as well as most of them are around 4MB which would require a 27c322/29F032/29F033 for ONE game. <br /><br />Making a multi cart would require something like a 29GL128 + proper level shifting as well as a 74HC161 to decode the highest address lines (A21 and A22 since we can have to up 4x 4MB games on the 29GL128 as it holds 16MB of data) to switch the games based on reset.<br /><br />You'll need custom made adapters/boards for that so I suggest an Evedrive/PowerPak or SD2SNES as well.
