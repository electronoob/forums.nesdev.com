<br />
<br />this is what i do..
<br />
<br />Make all the pixel work at native NES resolution.
<br />Index the color to a selected size, and algorithm
<br />Bring it back to RGB
<br />Motion blur by 1 pixel (this is the fake blending effect I did)
<br />Resize it to 580x480 using Bilinear filtering
<br />Make the canvas size 640x480 with a black background
<br />Flatten the layer if needed
<br />Add small amount of noise
<br />Motion blur again, but by 2 pixels now.
<br />Save the image
<br />
<br />and that is how you get a fake TV snapshot..
<br />
<br />(i do have a TV tuner, with a BT878, but no way was i going that far XD)
<br />
<br />EDIT:  And if you want to know how the music clips were done, it was via Native Instruments FM7..  I used a MIDI controller for the most part, and was stuck with only 3 note polyphonics (there was 2 squares, and a triangle, assigned to each note, depending on what i pushed first, hence why it sounded like crap..  i kept forgetting what the order was, when playing it)

<br />the intended use for this was stupid, play a movie, and control it with the NES controller, and use the NES PPU to draw the on-screen graphics...

<br />Yeah, the music sounded so horrible... For the graphics, some will say the opposite, but that was pretty decent, exept for sprites and dithering.
<br />The method to "fed tiles in the NES" you described is completely possible, however, but with only 4 colors. If you want to make a 4-tune monochrome graphic driver for the NES (but with a lot more complex graphics, lots of scrolling planes and sprites, 3D effects or anything), it'd be a cool project.

<br />well, as i said, i got experience with photoshop..  (and on the other forum), i do have some technical background with the NES...  i know what it can, and can't do..

<br />there won't be a second time, this was my last hoax ever..  im done with it, because the stress it bears is bad enough..
<br />
<br />the purpose for it, however, well, there was none..  being my last hoax, i just wanted something quick to do...
<br />
<br />as stated though, i do know some NES stuff, but that hoax was purposely error-filled..

<br />i was gonna use my NES emulator to hoax it authentically, but it's simulate NTSC artifacts option crashes the emulator (Nestopia)..  it used to work, prior to the update..

<br />It wouldn't even need to be monochrome. For each 8x1 pixel sliver, the tile translation circuitry could determine whether reds, greens, blues, or grays dominate and send out the appropriate attribute code. The ultimate project would be a TV tuner for the NES; that would enable all sorts of hoaxes.

<br />
<br />Well, your hoax was almost believable.  I kinda figured it was fake when you said you'd done all that in 2 months, but definitely sounded fake when you mentioned having the V30 halt the NES CPU to read from it's memory.  That would be doable perhaps if the NES mainboard was modified, but definitely not through the expansion port or a cart.
<br />
<br />But it was somewhat interesting to follow, the coprocessor framebuffer thing was something I thought of designing before (but probably won't due to costs better spent on a different design).  All you'd have to do is put a CPU on cart with some crazy-ass CHR memory controller logic.
<br />
<br />I actually do have a cart design with a coprocessor, a PIC18F.  NES can write to it's parallel port, and the PIC gives the NES an IRQ to let the NES read from it.  I wrote a little sound synth that runs on the PIC and feeds to the NES's DAC through software, it sounded so good I probably would think it was fake if I didn't know any better, heheh.

<br />sounds like a cool project..  what i wanted to do personally was already done:  a MIDI implementation for the NES..  that sucker cost a lot though..
<br />
<br />atleast the NES "can" output stereo (with the propper mod, which my NES went though), and making a synth out of it could be quite awesome...

<br />seems weird..  i'd understand the audio in/out, and the video out, but not the video in..  (or possibly just a video switch..  when NES is off, anything connected there passes through..)
