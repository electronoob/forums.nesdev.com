Also, has any of it improved in FCEUX 2.2.0?<br /><br />I have by no means tried every trick in the book, but I have tried several raster effects with success in FCEUX when compared to hardware, as well as a few things that require very precise timings (mostly audio related). Caling it a &quot;terrible choice&quot; seems contrary to my experience with it, but I'm sure it must have specific things that are emulated incorrectly, and yes it would be terrible for those things.<br /><br />I'm not trying to deny that it has problems, I just want to know more about what they are. I'd actually like to take accurate stock of this, since FCEUX, unlike Nestopia or Nintendulator, has ongoing collaborative development, and if it needs improvement somewhere I can actually do something to help it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&gt; I am currently up to this point about now so I assume that I will be releasing it a few months from now<br /><br />Well, good luck when you do release it.<br /><br />I'm not wrong on what drives software to be popular, but I'd sure like to be, so if your emulator really is better than everything else, I hope it succeeds.<br /><br />&gt; And about an entire frame of guaranteed lag. Not that I'm defending it; I'm just trying to reverse engineer the rationale that led to it.<br /><br />Yes, you're absolutely right there. Adding a compositor adds up to one extra frame of lag. I'd much rather take the extra frame of lag than not be able to Vsync, though. Even better, I'd love to be able to turn the compositor off when gaming fullscreen.<br /><br />And I used to be able to, and I did just that when going fullscreen with higan. And then Microsoft took the option to disable DWM away in Windows 8. So I just gave up on it and scrapped that feature. It never worked well on Linux anyway (all the windows go blank when you toggle Metacity and Xfce's compositors.)<br /><br />&gt; Are the diagonal stripes in Dr. Mario &quot;blending effects&quot; or &quot;degradation&quot; to you?<br /><br />NES is trickier. There was no way to get RGB output from it (shy of the Playchoice which had different colors and that's really an abuse of the system to swap chips like that.) The SNES is more clear cut.<br /><br />Basically, I want the video output to look like the real thing in the most pristine possible conditions. So that includes emulating NES composite output (staircasing and bleeding), SNES RGB output (bleeding), GB output (vomit green), GBA output (motion blur, horrendous and dim color palette), etc.<br /><br />&gt; Or perhaps you could figure out some practically implementable subset of Verilog, and mappers written in that could be shared among INL-ROM, PowerPak, and your emulator.<br /><br />Yeah, it's all a matter of where to draw the line. You can take this down to the transistor level. Or you could just have Python mappers and bundle an interpreter with your emulator.<br /><br />&gt; But if I open an iNES ROM, change a few bytes, open it again, change a few bytes, and open it again, do I end up with three copies of the board manifest, PRG ROM, and CHR ROM in an invisible folder? Or does it execute the old cached copy without checking whether it's been updated?<br /><br />If it gets an exact SHA256 match on an input file, it will name the file according to the database entry, and generate a 100% perfect board mapping.<br /><br />If not, the game folder gets the same filename as the ROM you loaded. So if you have lots of generic names, like &quot;test1.nes&quot;, you'd be in trouble there. It'll overwrite the old ROM if the file has changed (newer timestamp.)<br /><br />If you really want to develop with higan, you should use the game folder format and load the games that way. Write a simple shell script to dd copy chunks from a merged file after building it if you must. Developers are more capable of working with the limitations.<br /><br />&gt; Some people would consider that grounds to convert to NES 2.0, not to abandon iNES entirely.<br /><br />And that's fine, too.<br /><br />I emulate the NES, SNES, GB, GBC, GBA, and NDS. I want a consistent format that can tackle the challenges of every system.<br /><br />Again, it's just me trying some new things in my own way. There's a twelve-page bitchfest about me on ngemu for it, and it's just ridiculous. I don't understand why people are so bothered by me trying something different with my own software.<br /><br />RetroArch uses bsnes v092 and runs regular game files directly, no game folders period. As does OpenEmu, Mednafen, Bizhawk, and lsnes. You have options, even with my own code.<br /><br />I want to have technical discussions on the best way to handle this. But I don't want to deal with people who simply don't like that I am doing things differently. It's my software, until you start paying me, I will do what I want with it.<br /><br />&gt; People not supporting the stuff you come up with doesn't seem to have stopped you before... If you think that's an interesting experiment you should try it anyway. Isn't that how you work now?<br /><br />Well, yes. But the only benefit to external mappers would be for more than one emulator to use it. Not all, of course, but a few.<br /><br />Otherwise, if it's just for one emulator, they may as well be internal C++ implementations.<br /><br />SNES has chips inside the carts, too. Only its coprocessors are 10-20x more complex than even the MMC5.<br /><br />&gt; nothing prevents it from simply running it instead of saving new files to the hard disk, technically.<br /><br />You're right. It's doable. It's just that every single file handling routine would have to have a lot more code wrapped around it to choose between loading a game folder file, and loading a chunk of a merged file. The former with the game folder path and fixed filenames, the latter with user-definable paths for each file type, based off the game filename. And the GUI would have to re-add user selectable paths again.<br /><br />It would be a lot of work to write, and a lot of work to maintain. I have done it before in bsnes v070-089. So I'm speaking from actual experience.<br /><br />&gt; Yep, that's my point -- bad UI design.<br /><br />I'll unfortunately have to agree. But in Marty's defense, Nestopia is absolutely filled to the brim with features galore.<br /><br />Developing software and designing user interfaces are really two different mindsets. I make my own GUI with myself in mind, and I'm painfully aware of how it's confusing to new users.<br /><br />We need more people who are willing to write just the GUI portions for emulators. Every time someone tries to do this for my emulator, they end up forking off and making a multi-system, multi-emulator codebase. Eg RetroArch.<br /><br />&gt; I thought the developers of FCEUX were focusing on Bizhawk<br /><br />BizHawk is fun. But they load up their imported emulator codebases with snarky comments on their design <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&gt; 30-bit displays. Unless you're in a professional field, good luck finding a monitor that can do more than 24-bit.<br /><br />It is indeed a -very- complex thing to accomplish.<br /><br />First, I needed a 30-bit capable monitor. Look for the ones that advertise 1.07 billion colors. These are going to be IPS panels. Mine is the HP ZR30w. You'll be paying a minimum of $500 for your monitor.<br /><br />Second, you have to use DisplayPort. There is no option here. DVI does not support 30-bit (there's a hack for sending two images to the card, but it's a real hassle and not well supported.) HDMI supports it, but I've never seen a graphics card that allows 30-bit color over HDMI.<br /><br />Third, you have to use an nVidia Quadro or an ATI FirePro. This is absolutely required. I use an FX 580 Quadro. Just having DisplayPort is not enough. The GeForce and Radeon series do not support 30-bit color. Period. I think I've heard musings of the $600+ GeForces supporting it, but I wouldn't count on it. My bet is you'll only get 24-bit color over their DisplayPorts. Even more fun, for some fucked reason, the red/green/blue channels are reversed on my Quadro/Linux setup. So I have to generate a BGR palette for output.<br /><br />Fourth, Windows can only do 30-bit color with DirectX 11+ when in fullscreen exclusive mode, with all the above conditions met. OS X can't do it at all. Linux can do it with a depth of 30, but you will run into numerous problems. Most applications do not support 30-bit color. Basically, I had to install an experimental version of Metacity and replace my Xfce window manager with it, otherwise my window decorations were entirely corrupted gibberish. My desktop wallpaper did not show up, I could only get solid black. So I wrote my own desktop application to display wallpaper (and I can show 48-bit PNGs at true 30-bit, whee. Now I just have to find one.) Next, any app that uses a GTK+ pixmap (24-bit) doesn't work. So things like Ristretto photo viewer, Audacious splash screen, etc just show solid black.<br /><br />Finally, I had to enumerate my Xorg Visual by hand for XShm, and get OpenGL to use its ARGB1010102 texture mode attached to aforementioned Window with 30-bit Visual, to actually get true 30-bit color.<br /><br />After finally getting this all setup, I wrote some test apps to display 1024 color shades of gray, with all dithering disabled, to truly and accurately verify that I was really running at 30-bit, and confirmed that I was.<br /><br />For all that work ... it really does help with gradients. I literally can no longer tell the difference between two color shades. It also greatly helps with the SNES at luminance=0, I can show a lot more detail while still having the image as dark as it is on a real TV. There, but you really have to look closely. Exactly like the real thing. It's also a huge help with my NTSC TV gamma ramp simulation. With 24-bit, the colors are too narrow at the dark end, so you end up losing detail in really dark scenes like inside Lavos in Chrono Trigger. Now only the poor contrast of LCD in general is an issue.<br /><br />So yeah ... probably no more than 10 people actually using higan's true 30-bit output.<br /><br />&gt; DWM is disabled in fullscreen mode (with my DX10 app at least). Verified with gpuview on Windows 8 (and I'm pretty sure I've verified this on Windows 7 as well, but can't double check right now).<br /><br />Yeah, that's the thing. I don't have a true fullscreen mode. I just stretch the window over the entire display. I like avoiding the mode switching delays, and at least having the -option- to show the menubar is nice, even if I don't do it. But I have no choice now, so I'll have to implement a true fullscreen, exclusive mode.
