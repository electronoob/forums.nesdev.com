Like, if NA had a curated shop for counterfeit goods. This is not a defense, just pointing out these are two different things. <br /><br />In all likelyhood, most offenses against the community rules established on facebook go unmoderated, too. Would one then say facebook, as an entity and in itself, is e-bullying (and what not) because some users on facebook e-bully?

The NintendoAge forum is merely an <em>example</em>.<br />So, it really doesn't matter that my <em>example</em> might not stand a test in a court. Because I'm not trying to sue someone.

So, no, you cannot connect the behavior of certain users to Facebook itself.<br /><br />However, NintendoAge is a community that's pretty unified.<br />With the number of different reproductions that are always sold in the same manner (&quot;I created 50 copies of a reproduction. Please tell me if you want one&quot;), I'm pretty sure that the NintendoAge forum staff is not against those activities. In the contrary, I assume they would take pride in the statement that this or that reproduction was done by their community members and distributed through their forum threads.<br />I mean, it's not like we can say: &quot;You're really doing NintendoAge wrong. They hate those reproductions as well. Some of those sales probably simply slipped through the moderators' radar.&quot;<br /><br />Again, not that this would have any relevance for the topic at hand.

A big part of NA is letting its users buy sell and trade things from each other, and repros are not a banned category.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">DRW wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">However, NintendoAge is a community that's pretty unified.</div><br />It really isn't. Quite a few users here have said that they want all reproduction talk banned from this place, but clearly the administrators have decided to allow it. The repro subforum's existence is not a reflection of every member's viewpoint, and it's not even remotely representative of consensus. It exists because of an executive decision, and there are a subset of users (myself included) who think it's an acceptable topic for discussion. It's pretty much the same situation at NA, and I think they have a larger variety of users than this forum too. (Users who don't like the repro forum generally just don't participate, they don't jump into repro discussions and interrogate those involved.)<br /><br />You've drawn a lot of conclusions like &quot;if a person cares about X, then they can't possibly want Y&quot;, and it's really not reflective of what people are actually doing here. Maybe you're confused about why people want these things, but all I can say is that there's more factors than you're permitting in your mental model of people here, and many of them are weighted decisions rather than black and white. Not every issue is critical.<br /><br />Someone who doesn't like the fake Nintendo seal might still want the repro anyway because the fake seal isn't an ultimatum issue for them. Not every purchase is an endorsement of the complete package. There are certainly people that only want 100% original authentic things, but there's tons of people who just want a box and cart that look and feel nice that will play in their machine.<br /><br />Context always matters too, words that are literally a lie aren't necessarily a lie in practice. If nobody's being deceived, it's not really a very good lie, but it might still be a good joke, or otherwise fun to say.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is a bit off-topic, so I'll use a smaller font.  This is mainly in reply to <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=218232#p218232" class="postlink">rainwarrior's post</a> but not so much a reply *to* him as much as a general history lesson...<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 90%; line-height: normal">One of the reasons (historically) why repro discussions never came up here was due to the forum being hosted on Parodius.  We maintained a very strict no-money/no-financial-transactions policy -- hosted users (which included users/visitors of those hosted sites) couldn't participate in any kind of advertising or transaction that involved money (i.e. homebrew games could not be sold/advertised, same with used parts, or anything else).  There were several reasons for this which I'd rather not go into in this thread (start a separate thread or just ask me if you want details), but we operated this way from day 1 until closure in August 2012.<br /><br />This policy put a kibosh on most repro discussions, since most (but not all) were from people who wanted instructions on how to wire up/build (or troubleshoot failed) repros in attempt to Get Rich Quick(tm).  Occasionally someone with chutzpah would post about repro help and insist it was for their own personal project, not for financial gain, and they'd get some help.  The number of repro posts gradually began to grow from around 2008 onward.  If you look at the link rainwarrior posted, you'll see that there tends to be a pretty large increase in the post counts starting around 2011 or so, and definitely after 2012.<br /><br />When Parodius closed down and the site moved to be hosted by WhoaMan, that no-finance limitation was lifted.  This gave way to larger and large numbers of posts solely about repros, regardless of driving force.  Given the gradually-increasing quantity of posts about the subject, eventually there was a public discussion about the matter: should topics about repros be permitted?  It was a heated discussion mainly due to everyone having different opinions on the matter, but in the end it was decided that there should be a separate board/section (Reproductions) made, since those who were against them could have a semi-easy way to filter them out/ignore them.  Older posts (pre-Reproductions-section-creation) were moved into Reproductions by admins.<br /><br />Because of the earlier days, I think NintendoAge became the defunct place to go to for repro help.  IIRC, the NA forum tends to be filled with mostly non-technical folk, while nesdev tends to be the opposite.  But it didn't take long for repro-folk to realise that the hardware-focused &quot;electro wizards&quot; resided here.  Thus, we now have a substantial number of regular posts about repros (most being, summarised, &quot;I tried to do one and it failed. Why?&quot;).<br /></span>

Without NA, there'd either be a new collected platform for repros/bootlegs, or all you'd have is ebay + various standalone shops. Why would that be bad? Well, on NA you have a community, people are not as anonymous, there's a sense of social accountability among peers, you can communicate, and there are means to close down problematic traders. Again correlating to drugs (which is me exaggering things considering the gap in tragic effects): Most advocates for clean syringe handouts recognize that injecting drugs is bad in a multitude of ways. It's just a worse outcome if there's *no* pragmatic approach at all, so the question then becomes if you prioritize moral symbolism (arguing it has a preventing effect on its own) or concrete damage prevention. In the the world of repros/bootlegs, you have pcb:s which may damage consoles, destruction of original cartridges, and risk of fraudulent agendas on top of the bootlegging. All these risks would be higher if Ebay + standalone eshops were the sole outlet for bootlegs. <br /><br /><br />---<br /><br /><br />As for the bootleg itself:<br />Personally i admire the artistry involved in making something looking authentic even though it isn't, or even when something playfully dance around a trademark or some such. I don't think i'd be interested in buying it, but can understand the reasons why someone would just like to watch a shelf of things that look neat together. <br /><br />A few cultural side notes:<br />In chinese, there's a word that translates to &quot;fake&quot; or &quot;counterfeit&quot; but lacks the negative connotations that fake has in the occident. Rather, it implies a sort of cunning ingenuity and justified act of rebellion you have bragging rights to. Sometimes the art lies in making it indistinguishly close to the original, or sometimes it is in blatantly and playfully gets things wrong, like a sport sweater saying &quot;adodas&quot; or harry potter fan fiction posed as an official release but mysteriously lacking the authors' name. Quoting a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanzhai" class="postlink">wikipedia</a> article:<br /><br />&quot;Historically, &quot;shanzhai&quot; is sometimes used as a metaphor to describe bandits who oppose and evade the corrupted authority to perform deeds they see as justified. One example of such bandits is the story of Water Margin[2]<br /><br />The use of &quot;Shanzhai&quot; to refer to imitation products comes from Cantonese slang, in which &quot;shanzhai factory&quot; means an ill-equipped, low-end and family-based factory. &quot;<br /><br />and <br /><br />&quot;Shanzhaiism (山寨主義) is a philosophical term denoting a Chinese style of innovation with a peasant mind-set.<br /><br />Shanzhaiism has an equivalent English term: tinker&quot;. <br /><br />I think we could call small-scale repro/bootleg artists tinkerers in this sense. <br /><br />In christian western culture (accentuated during the 18th century by philosophers, writers and artists and perpetually reinvigorated), there has been a sort of myth building around the lone, creating genious and authorship. I think this ideal is bound to crumble or at least change in an ever-rationalizing industrial/information society where we are more and more confronted with situations where creation is non-personal or communal in varying degrees. This has always been the case to some degree but i feel as if it is becoming more accentuated now. Yet there is a psychological need to identify with what you create, or at least to mirror/define yourself in what you create. I wonder how that will play out. Please note i'm not making an attempt at delegitimizing authorship. Just saying that the features of authorship are changing in culture and over time.
