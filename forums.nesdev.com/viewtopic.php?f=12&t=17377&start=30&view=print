For now, I'm using “bsnes-mcfly”, but the name won't become final until higan and bsnes v107 are released.<br /><br />The release thread is on <a href="https://board.byuu.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=2061" class="postlink">byuu's message board</a>.<br /><br />AWJ has made his choice final and will continue pushing for XML manifests and fighting against BML manifests, so I'll have to push ever harder to make my project into something anyone will choose over bsnes v073 or bsnes-classic. <strong>If anyone has any reason whatsoever to switch back to bsnes v073 or AWJ's bsnes-classic after trying my emulator, please let me know. I will rectify that situation as soon as I can. Even if I have to convert <a href="https://board.byuu.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=1977" class="postlink">Olympian Magic</a> into a library so that XML manifests are converted internally to BML.</strong> It's either this, or XML manifests continue existing forevermore, just like ZSNES and Internet Explorer 6.<br /><br />That said, if byuu's upcoming bsnes revival is enough for you, I encourage you to use it instead because of its choice to use the much more stable hiro toolkit instead of the bug's nest that is Qt. It's only people switching back to bsnes v073 or bsnes-classic that I'm worried about.

That feature wasn't in bsnes v073, and the only reason it was in ZSNES was as a workaround for the many timing issues that plagued the emulator.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I do plan on beginning to replace bsnes-plus once higan v107 is released. I could start earlier, and years of maintaining a laevateinn fork have taught me that it is doable, but I want to wait until higan and bsnes v107 are released first.<br /><br />Right now, I want to migrate to the recently-released higan v106r40, which <a href="https://twitter.com/byuu_san/status/1005998014522187776" class="postlink">compiles both the accurate and fast profiles into a single executable without a performance penalty</a> and allows automatic selection of profiles when running Air Strike Patrol and Koushien 2. After that, I will try and make it run the English version of Tengai Makyou Zero (whose team put actual effort into hacking up an XML manifest and drove me to create bsnes-mcfly in the first place, as I've said before).<br /><br />As for the suggestion to post to Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/8hzia1/the_old_bsnes_v073_qt_gui_is_getting_upgraded_to/" class="postlink">didn't someone post about it already</a>?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think there are some fullscreen config options already, aren't there? You will have to use keyboard shortcuts though, especially if you use Direct3D's exclusive mode.<br /><br />By default, pressing Shift+6 (not the keypad, the horizontal number key) will set either square pixels or 8:7 rectangular pixels* depending on whether you have Correct Aspect Ratio turned on. Either way, this leaves black bars on the left and right sides of the screen. I don't mind the black bars at all, but I heard they really bother a few users, so...<br /><br />Pressing Shift+7 will completely ignore the console's native pixel aspect ratio and horizontally stretch the emulated screen to fill the entire monitor. I find this horizontal stretching to be really ugly, but it does cover up the black bars if that's what you truly want.<br /><br />Pressing Shift+8 will chop off parts of the top and bottom to minimize horizontal stretching while still filling the entire screen. Depending on the game, this could chop off important info. In Super Mario World, the HUD is still visible, but a small portion of the top is cut off.<br /><br />You can also press Shift+1, Shift+2, Shift+3, Shift+4, or Shift+5 to set the resolution to 256×239, 512×478, 768×717, 1024×956, or 1280×1195 respectively. Depending on your monitor, not only will this create black bars on the left and right sides, it also creates them on the top and bottom as well.<br /><br />*Important note: 8:7 is the <em>pixel aspect ratio</em> of the SNES, or the ratio of a single pixel's width to its height. The overall <em>display aspect ratio</em> is 64:49 when displaying 224 scanlines and 2048:1673 when displaying 239 scanlines. The display aspect ratio of the NES (240 scanlines) is 128:105.<br /><br />================================<br /><br />As for Mega Man X2 not loading the first time and loading the second time instead (yes, I saw your pre-edit post): I cannot reproduce this bug, and it sounds like the other computers you tried cannot reproduce it either? In the current development version on my computer, I made a slight change to the load/unload program code to cover up a <em>possible</em> source of bugs, which will appear in bsnes-mcfly v106r06. If it does come up again, be sure to check the firmware/ folder and make sure that cx4.data.rom is intact.<br /><br />However, the preferred form is to concatenate this firmware directly to the game ROM and make a 1,575,936 byte ROM <strong>that still works in ZSNES and Snes9x</strong>. If you do that, bsnes-mcfly (and bsnes v107) will ignore the firmware/ folder and use the concatenated ROM instead, which is currently the only way to use a custom firmware if one gets created in the future. byuu has been pushing for concatenated firmware for many years now, yet No-Intro has strongly opposed it for fear of not being able to distinguish where the main program ROM ends and where the firmware begins. Something that icarus proves is a piece of cake, no harder than detecting copier headers.
