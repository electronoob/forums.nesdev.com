And the games that <em>require</em> the timing are titles such as:<br />* Mecarobot Golf<br />* Jumbo Osaki no Hole in One Golf<br />* Street Racer<br />* Power Rangers (one of them, anyway)<br />* Sink or Swim<br />* Speedy Gonzales<br />* Battle Blaze<br />Not exactly A-list games here, so it's no wonder when people play Zelda and Mario alone that they think things are perfect. (Even though there are obvious problems even in both of those, heh.)<br /><br />In most cases, you can get away with murder by running too fast. Mortal Kombat II breaks completely if you have one extra I/O cycle on WAI (as little as one ten-millionth of a second per frame), but you can run it twice as fast as you should and it works fine.<br /><br />I think it's really just the PPU that scares people off the SNES. The PPU is a nightmare: 64 registers versus 8, and every one is packed full of flags that all interact and blend with each other. That, and CPU hell. SMP, SuperFX, SA-1, uPD96050, HG51B169 ... unlike mappers, these are full-fledged processors with lots of auxiliary functions built-in. And unlike obscure NES mappers, support for all of these is basically mandatory if you want anyone to use your work.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Sat Feb 04, 2012 12:44 pm</p><hr />

&gt; What you say is true of ZSNES, or at least it was when ZSNES relied on x86-only assembly language code. (Does it still?)<br /><br />Yes, the parts ported to C were mostly the GUI and path loading code.<br /><br />&gt; Snes9x might get a free pass because its pure C++ code allows ports to Wii consoles and Android phones, which aren't especially "faster computers".<br /><br />I don't really mind emulators based around speed hacks aimed at older/slower hardware. Although in most cases it's the owners being penny wise, pound foolish; there are legitimate cases where faster hardware can't be easily obtained. I just wish the people who <em>did</em> have faster hardware cared a bit more about quality. Improving ZSNES would be addressing the symptom rather than the cause, but it'd be better than nothing.<br /><br />I've had enough of trying myself, but it'd be nice if we had someone like Marty to make a compelling, user-friendly UI <em>and</em> worry about accuracy <em>and</em> worry about making it as quick as possible. I could certainly lend my assistance toward the first two.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Fri Feb 03, 2012 4:23 pm</p><hr />

&gt; Plenty of liberties were taken for performance and other things probably just because many details were unknown.<br /><br />SMP opcode cycle counts were known before ZSNES was started on. We even had the WDC CPU documentation on per-cycle operation. Many of its decisions were deliberate. And for the time, wise.<br /><br />What's worse is that even knowing the information now, and even with faster computers, simple one-line fixes are still not added.<br /><br />&gt; This should sound familiar to NES emulation.<br /><br />The NES was much more timing-sensitive, and the SNES alleviates a lot of that through HDMA and IRQs. But make no mistake, having emulated both systems myself: NESticle was a more faithful NES emulator than ZSNES is an SNES emulator.<br /><br />Imagine if NESticle were given a crude Win32 windowed-mode port, and a new minor release every 3-5 years. And saying anything at all bad about it invoked ridicule on most emulation forums. Wouldn't that be a treat? :P<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Fri Feb 03, 2012 12:23 pm</p><hr />

Mmh, really ?<br />I remember Snes9x emulating it more or less properly, even tough this emulator is quite inaccurate. Maybe ZSNES is even more inacurate though.<br /><br />Aside of that I have another idea for practical BRR streaming synchronization.<br />At all times, one of the communication regs would tell the CPU how many BRR blocks it's supposed to send to the SPC.<br /><br />This way, the SPC increment this number automatically as the streamed audio plays. Then it's up the CPU to respond by sending its data, then the SPC acknownledge data, overwrite the old buffer and the count reset to zero.<br /><br />This would also work on both PAL and NTSC consoles (and probably emulators) without changing any line of code. and it would be simpler than my previous solution.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Jan 28, 2012 9:49 am</p><hr />
