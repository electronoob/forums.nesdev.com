<br />Did you see my <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Connecting-Nokia-3310-LCD-to-USB-using-AVR/" class="postlink">Nokia display to USB</a> project on instructables? You don't need a parallel port at all and it's infact very easy to make. As far as I know, Atmel has some AVR chips that have high-speed USB. So it should defiantly be feasible with very little effort put into it.

It's not hard at all, and doesn't require that the PC do any special timing.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Wkter wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Did you see my Nokia display to USB project on instructables?

For example, the FTDI USB-to-TTL 5V cable, just splice it with a controller cable, as I and thefox have done recently. Or use a MAX232, as I've been doing for about 15 years now for NES and SNES development via connection to a PC.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I do this all the time.

<br />I have a lot of devcarts with only battery RAM, no ROM. These get corrupt due to a crashed program, or one that hangs when the reset vector doesn't point to the bootloader, so I need to rewrite the RAM. I just boot on another cartridge, then hotswap to the one needing reprogramming (with a programming running on the NES that cosntantly does sprite DMA, so that it's less likely to crash). And as you say, this is how I ran tests on various revisions of the MMC3, also some of those MMC5 tests. Combined with the Game Genie, you can have the NMI and IRQ vectors pointing into RAM.

<br />
<br />Dragon Ninja doesn't use the N106 music hardware, just the mapper.  From what I understood, Sdm converted the cart and could use Megami tensei II on it which does require N106 part for the music.  There is some schema related to the music mod but I don't understand electronic so I don't know what it does exactly.  Maybe if you read the thread and check the schema you will figure it out.  
<br />
<br />Dragon Ninja is not an expensive cart.  I got one cart exactly for that but never found the time to do the mod.  It does contain a N106, no blob (I opened it).

How big was the music code in SMB1? And how hard would it be to stream the music from a PC through controller port 2?<br /></div>
<br />
<br />I've done the sound streaming before, it was absurdly simple.  Added just a few lines of code to an NSF plugin for winamp, then had the NES sit there and continually grab "address, data" in bit-banged RS232 style.  Extend the address you can control the entire NES that way too, I suppose.
