Again, I would like to verify if this is correct or not.<br /></div><br /><br />Sounds right.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">sronsse wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />We now have data corresponding to the two first tiles to be drawn first on the next scanline. Do the shift registers STOP shifting at that point? As there are two unused fetches happening right after, I would assume they stop otherwise on-screen pixel data would be lost. Are the shifters only &quot;shifting&quot; between cycle 2 and cycle 256? Are they even shifting during cycles 321-336 or are the shift registers purely loaded during that time frame? The wiki (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_rendering">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_rendering</a><!-- m -->) mentions that every cycle, a bit is fetched from the 4 background shift registers in order to create a pixel on screen. The wiki also says that afterwards, the shift registers are shifted once, to the data for the next pixel. Every 8 cycles/shifts, new data is loaded into these registers. This information is a bit misleading to me, and I assume that shifting is not happening all the time, but I would like somebody to confirm when shifting exactly happens. I'm generally pretty confused also as to why the two 8-bit AT registers are shift register in the first place - are these also shifted by 1 bit every cycle? The diagram at the beginning of the PPU rendering wiki page is not perfectly straight-forward to me.<br /></div><br /><br />The shifters seem to shift between dots 2...257 and dots 322...337 (inclusive, with a shift on each of those dots). You're right that it wouldn't make sense for it to keep shifting after it fetches the second tile at the end of the line, since data for the first tile would be shifted out and lost then. It also seems the shifts before the first tile load at 329 are useless. Should add this to the wiki...<br /><br />16-bit tile regs are needed to accommodate fine x scrolling, which works by selecting a bit from the lower 8 bits of the shift register. If fine x is placed on bit 7 (counting from 0), it must be possible to shift 8 times without running out of bits, and that requires 16 bits. For attribute bits you can get away with just 8 bits + 1 bit, since the bit shifted in from the &quot;upper&quot; part is always the same for the entire tile.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">sronsse wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Now, regarding drawing - why would &quot;4 background shift registers&quot; (mentioned in the wiki) be needed for drawing one pixel? I assume only three would be needed (low BG, high BG, and one AT byte corresponding to the tile pixel you are rendering). Is this correct?<br /></div><br /><br />It probably turned out to be simpler to split the two AT bits into their own shift regs like for the tile data. Makes sense with how fine x works.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5911">ulfalizer</a> — Tue Aug 06, 2013 9:05 am</p><hr />

At the beginning of a tile, the 8-bit attribute shift registers contain the attribute bits for that tile, while the next tile's attribute bits are simply connected to the shift registers' <strong>inputs</strong> - since it's all the same bit, the result is the same as if the shift registers were 16 bits wide with the upper 8 bits being set to the next tile's value. The actual attribute byte for the next tile is stored in a nearby 8-bit latch, and VRAM address bits A1 and A6 are fed into 4-to-1 multiplexers to select which bits go into the shift register inputs.<br /><br />If you want to see the actual circuitry, you can load up Visual2C02 and search for node 10251 - it's right in the middle of the logic you're implementing.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7">Quietust</a> — Tue Aug 06, 2013 6:36 am</p><hr />

Hi tepples,<br /><br />Actually there is still one part I don't quite get. As the palette attribute shift registers are only 8-bit wide, they can only contain information to render 8 pixels, correct? But the BG data shift regs can contain data for 2 tiles, meaning 16 pixels. Does that mean that there are actually two internal latches for storing two different AT bytes? When is the 8-bit register pair loaded with tile 0 palette attributes, and with tile 1?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Sebastien<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6105">sronsse</a> — Mon Aug 05, 2013 11:49 pm</p><hr />

Please correct me if I'm wrong.<br /><br />Now the process continues for the second tile:<br />- Still at cycle 329, an NT byte is placed in an internal latch<br />- At cycle 331, an AT byte is placed in an internal latch<br />- At cycle 333, low BG tile byte is placed in an internal latch<br />- At cycle 335, high BG tile byte is placed in an internal latch<br />- At cycle 337 (8 cycles later than NT fetch), the AT byte and both low and high BG tiles are placed in corresponding shift registers (<strong>higher 8 bits for BG data</strong>).<br />As the first tile has been entirely shifted by then, <strong>the contents for the first tile are now present in the lower byte of the 16-bit register</strong>, and contents for the second one are placed on the higher bytes of these 16-bit registers. Again, I would like to verify if this is correct or not.<br /><br />We now have data corresponding to the two first tiles to be drawn first on the next scanline. Do the shift registers STOP shifting at that point? As there are two unused fetches happening right after, I would assume they stop otherwise on-screen pixel data would be lost. Are the shifters only &quot;shifting&quot; between cycle 2 and cycle 256? Are they even shifting during cycles 321-336 or are the shift registers purely loaded during that time frame? The wiki (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_rendering">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_rendering</a><!-- m -->) mentions that every cycle, a bit is fetched from the 4 background shift registers in order to create a pixel on screen. The wiki also says that afterwards, the shift registers are shifted once, to the data for the next pixel. Every 8 cycles/shifts, new data is loaded into these registers. This information is a bit misleading to me, and I assume that shifting is not happening all the time, but I would like somebody to confirm when shifting exactly happens. I'm generally pretty confused also as to why the two 8-bit AT registers are shift register in the first place - are these also shifted by 1 bit every cycle? The diagram at the beginning of the PPU rendering wiki page is not perfectly straight-forward to me.<br /><br />Now, regarding drawing - why would &quot;4 background shift registers&quot; (mentioned in the wiki) be needed for drawing one pixel? I assume only three would be needed (low BG, high BG, and one AT byte corresponding to the tile pixel you are rendering). Is this correct?<br /><br />I think that's all the questions I have for now! I'm sorry for the long post, I just want to make sure I follow the original design as close as I can. Looking forward to your replies.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Sebastien<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6105">sronsse</a> — Mon Aug 05, 2013 9:49 pm</p><hr />
