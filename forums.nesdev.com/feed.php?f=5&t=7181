The unfortunate reality of the internet is, we will always have people looking for an easy way out looking for someone willing to do the work for them. Even if there was a wiki or visual site dedicated to reproducing carts from cannibalized donors we would still have people come and ask I soldered A-B and never got C what did I do wrong. <br />So if we had that visual instruction site with detailed pictures and instructions for the lazy (maybe cut out any theory but add a troubleshooting guide) then there would be sufficient reason for a Mod to lock a thread at the instant the questions are asked and a referral to said instruction page.<br />As for those who whine bitch and condemn those who come here for help on touchy subjects, quit wasting your time energy and sanity on these people and put your minds together and create this instruction site to rid yourselves of this annoyance.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2415">marvelus10</a> — Tue Apr 12, 2011 10:43 am</p><hr />

Yeah, when you think about it though, graphics are something that definitely benefits from cross-development and doesn't get tested the way code does (other than sprite zero, heh), so it wouldn't be as bad to use real EPROMs for CHR.  But yeah CHR-RAM is pretty easy, I made a bootloader that loaded 8kB CHR, but one could add larger CHR and use the bankswitching to the same effect.  Won't be as fast to load since there's an extra couple steps in there, though.<br /><br />The CHR bus is pretty much free from worries with bus conflicts, mapper conflicts, and all that.  I've been curious how CHR-Flashrom writing would work (or if it would), I haven't bothered to try it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Nov 30, 2010 8:01 pm</p><hr />

$130 is a great price for PowerPak, I think.  You're paying more for the variety of mapper support (which 95% of is practically useless to developers), and the convenience of using compact flash.<br /><br />Building a CopyNES and using the PPak Lite or something similar is another option.  But of course, that could be argued to be harder than modifying a cart.  And the USB CopyNES kit at $70, IIRC is maybe twice what kevtris sold the parallel port kit version for (parallel port can be a pain to deal with though).  CopyNES can be made to program flash carts.  So that's more convenient than an EPROM burner.<br /><br />An EPROM emulator is also a very good option, I spent around $200 on one a while back, and they can be bought for about the same price these days I think (with USB support, maybe battery backup).  For anyone that doesn' tknow, it's just a board with an SRAM (and a PC interface to it), and a standard IDC cable that plugs into an EPROM socket.  You just upload the memory from the PC, and it's live, no powering off the system needed.<br /><br />Many years ago I actually had thought about designing one (there's not much to it) and producing a ROM emulator.  But one annoyance is that you can't find DIP-32 IDC adapters anywhere (you can get 28-pin and 40-pin all day), so you have to cut down 40-pin ones.  That, and the fact that there are already lots of them around.<br /><br />And yeah, emulators on a PC can be used for testing and debugging, and that's just great for most of your game (like all the logic and 6502 stuff).  But when it comes to dealing with the PPU and doing timing tricks, I can only be shocked and amazed when emulators get it looking the same as an NES.  You might be OK if you stick to things that Battletoads does, or other cases that actually get tested, but other than that it's always seemed surprisingly easy to get stuff on an NES screen that looks different on emulators (often with differences between every emulators).  Until even recently, if you had written a game like NESnake 2 that uses DPCM and reads the controllers, you would have been totally screwed when you tried to play it on an NES.  I'm sure there are still other "gotchas" remaining to be found somewhere.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Nov 30, 2010 5:28 pm</p><hr />

Back when the PowerPak didn't exist and I wanted to try my programs on hardware, I took the opportunity to learn a little about electronics, but I imagine that not everyone is willing to go down that path, and have no wish to ever work with hardware, just software. For that kind of people I guess that the PowerPak is a nice thing to have.<br /><br />Even though I can test my software using a PowerPak or a development cartridge, I usually go with the PowerPak. My EPROM programmer is kept away (having it share the desk with my cats probably wouldn't end well), but my card reader is right here. I don't trust the PowerPak much when it comes to mappers though, so if I ever work on anything that uses more than a discrete logic mapper I'll surely double check a few times along the way.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Nov 30, 2010 4:14 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, but you still have to consider donor carts, sockets, wires, solder, solder sucker/desoldering iron/heat gun... The PowerPak <strong>is</strong> cheaper than a good traditional setup, but it can be much more expensive that a cheap setup.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Nov 30, 2010 3:53 pm</p><hr />

It all depends on what programmer you use. The kind I would consider getting if I were interested in that sort of thing still would run around 100$ maybe a bit more. So the PowerPAK would cost very close to the same as EPROM Programmer + some blank Eproms.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Tue Nov 30, 2010 1:02 pm</p><hr />

I totally understand the frustration, I feel it too.  What I had considered doing before (but decided against it, for now) was to make a section of the forum that's dedicated to cart/system modifications.  I guess it'd be like the newbie forum, but more specialized.<br /><br />Reasons I decided against it include:<br /><ul><li>it's stuff could be addressed with a FAQ/wiki and a single thread for questions / related issues outside the scope of the original queston</li><li>concern about spreading things too thin</li><li>typically there's only way to wire it.  it works, or it doesn't.  it's boring!</li></ul><br />Of course if any random person wants to post about their nifty idea to modify a cart or NES, hopefully they'd feel free to do so anyways (and likely would skip over any rules if there were any).  I wouldn't expect it to to be something creative, but one can hope.  A discussion at Nintendoage about adding LEDs into an NES cart was kinda interesting.  Led me to think of a way an array of LEDs could glow at different brightnesses depending on how long the NES had a particular bank switched in during a frame.  Just a trick, but maybe useful for debugging/testing.<br /><br />But to the original topic, I've just been dead-set against having any kind of rules at all and have wanted to keep it that way as much as possible.  I'd enable anonymous posting like it was originally (IP address only), if not for it surely turning into spamfest-2010.  I'm sure every huge bureaucratic system started out with a good intention and one rule to enforce.<br /><br />I'm not sure where else a rule like this can lead other than requiring all sorts of detective work and grand inquisition as to why they're doing it.  It's too useful for developers to use it (though I think anyone wanting to using ASIC mappers and clones of such won't get the most "bang for their buck").<br /><br />Oh what I forgot to say in my other posts - There is at least one upside for NES developers of people buying reproductions.  That means people are using their NES's, and that they want to buy new carts for it.  And that's a pretty damn good upside, if you want to release a game.<br /><br />tepples: mentioning the PowerPak in a guideline wording or similar I think comes close to being an advertisement or endorsement (even though it is the only option in a lot of cases).  of course a full list of options for different situations would be better, but that's more work and maintenance (and maybe would be nice to have on the wiki, if it's not already).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Nov 29, 2010 4:50 pm</p><hr />

I say give him a couple of years and he will probably see things differently then.<br /><br />That's what happened to me at least... back when I had no obligations I used to say that my personal projects were just for fun and I would never make money from them, but now I'm in a position that in order to justify the time I want to spend on my personal projects I'll have to sell them, because I won't be using that time to work on something else to bring money home.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Nov 29, 2010 4:34 pm</p><hr />
