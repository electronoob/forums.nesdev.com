<br />I see that your intention are good but if we do this, we may split the current community.

<br />Basically what you're saying is the current administration doesn't do it job or doesn't have the proper rights to do it.  Isn't it the time to add more fresh admins that would update the main page and take care of the message board to fix the spam issue?
<br />
<br />Can we find a way to add people to do the job and add all the interesting ideas that you propose or right now nobody is listening? If this is the case then we would have no choice to move somewhere else. 
<br />
<br />By the way, does the content of this message board can be imported to the bbs you're using?

<br />This issue has been here for a long time. I swear I've brought it up before, and even then Memblers seems to show up about once a year.

<br />Even then, what little action <em>is</em> taken here seems to be wholly inefficient.

<br />Well, it's true that since Quietust and Koetsu are gone, the Nesdev communauty has seriously decayed. Memblers is still here but is really not that much active, likely he's busy with something else in real life and we can't blame him for that.
<br />
<br />About moving to a new forum, why not (we have already moved to this forum from another several years ago right after I came into NESdev), but will this really fix problems or will it add more problems ? If administrators and moderators are more active, will that incitate people to release more games or demoes for the NES ?

<br />First: 1.A2 is an old, incomplete clone of the original code (the latest, most secure version is currently in use on Jul; disregard the date). Those security holes do not exist in the version Jul is running.
<br />
<br />Second: I was there for every one of those drama storms, and suggest you take anything that board has to say with a grain of salt. It was far more complex than "Xkeeper threw a fit and blew up the board." The only people that post on that board anymore are the ones who were repeatedly banned for spamming and disruptive behavior (as a quick visit <a href="http://board.acmlm.org/forum.php?id=1" class="postlink">here</a> proves), so obviously their view of past events is going to be a bit tainted.

<br />Well, I'm thinking what Banshaku said is the best thing. Memblers is obviously really busy, because he rarely comes online that often. To me, it would seem a better idea to see if he is comfortable enough to share FTP privileges with someone to the main site, and allow them to make updates to it, fix broken links, etc., as well as fix up the boards to guard against spambots.
<br />
<br />Picking up and moving to an entirely different place just seems like a bad idea to me. There is so much info here, it's crazy!

I've added a few mods and patches to it before, and usually that involved editing a lot of files manually and was generally a pain.  I'd be glad to see it go, but I can't imagine that everyone really wants to move now.
<br />
<br />We were using a different forum software for a long time.  Hell, we had anonymous posts enabled for years without any notable problem.  It was all nice and open, I think many people posted who wouldn't have otherwise, and the forum grew.
<br />
<br />The main complaint with the old forum, was that no one could edit posts.  So we moved to phpBB, the older forum is frozen but still up for reference.  First post was 10/12/00, almost 8 years ago.
<br /><a href="http://nesdev.com/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=nesdev&amp;Number=1&amp;page=43&amp;view=collapsed&amp;sb=5" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=nesdev&amp;Number=1&amp;page=43&amp;view=collapsed&amp;sb=5</a>
<br />
<br />If there's anyone who really wants to become a spam control expert for the site, by editing the forum software, just say so.  If I can't get you ftp access, I could supply the needed files.
