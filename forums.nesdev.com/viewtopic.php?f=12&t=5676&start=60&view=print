<br />
<br />I checked things out, comparing lock/key source,  and given that the chips are in perfect sync with each other,  what you had before will cause input to be hooked up to input, and output to be hooked up to output, 100% of the time.  Needless to say,  both chips would hit their die routines very shortly after seed transmission, if hooked up as suggested in source.

<br />
<br />I was just curious about the key implimentation - from what I gather it starts as one region, and if its incorrect it automatically switches to the other region when you reset/power cycle the console. My question is does it 'remember' the correct lock region setting, or do you need to reset/power cycle the console everytime you want to use it?
<br />
<br />Also, would it be possible to make the key auto-detect the lock region (Like the lock implimentation) or is that not possible?
<br />
<br />Lastly, now that we have a working SNES CIC clone how much harder would it be to make an N64 CIC clone? I guess a clone of the 6102/7101 would be most desirable, or the 6105/7105 if it could be used in conjuction with a 'universal boot emulator'.

<br />
<br />If I wanted to use the lock implimentation in my SNES console would it be best to completely remove the original CIC chip and connect the clone to the correct pads? Or should I just disable the original CIC (By turning it into a key) and then 'piggyback' the connections? Or would it work either way?
<br />
<br />Also, you mentioned 'reverse engineering' would be required to make an N64 CIC clone, and I just wondered what information is actually needed? I only ask as I have already seen some pictures of a decapped N64 CIC chip a while ago, and there is also a dump available of the PIF ROM (The PIF-NUS chip is the 'lock' chip inside the N64 console, although it also handles the controllers, memory cards, etc as well which is why it can't just be disabled like the SNES lock chip) Although I am unsure if this is a dump of the CIC part, of the boot part of the PIF-NUS chip.
<br />
<br />...I just thought it might be easier to make an N64 CIC clone now, especially since we now have a better understanding of how the CIC CPU works, and a working clone thanks to yourself.
<br />
<br />Thanks again for your help <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />I didn't do this yet, just the usual Pin 4 mod with the PIC soldered on top. With this the SNES refuses to boot directly after power up - I have to push reset once. I think the additional pin 8 mod should fix this but I haven't tried yet. <span style="color: red"><strong>Note that this does NOT work! I just tested it.

<br />
<br />What I do know now is that <em>if</em> you remove the original CIC completely you'll need a pull-down resistor between CIC pin 8 / PIC pin 4 and GND. 10kΩ will do. There's a debouncing capacitor connected to the reset button that seems to take forever to discharge when the PIC is used instead of the CIC.
<br />
<br />
<br />I'll try to watch an N64 do its CIC stuff. Can you point me at the ROM dump?
<br />The die photos I found at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://retroactive.be/mirror/n64/cic_die/">http://retroactive.be/mirror/n64/cic_die/</a><!-- m --> are nice but the ROMs are unreadable. Are there any others?

<br />
<br />For the 10kΩ resistor does it matter if I use metal film or carbon film, or if its 1/4W or 1/2W etc? Also, is it possible the PIC code can be changed to remove the need for a resistor? (I'm guessing no, but just wanted to check)
<br />
<br />Regarding the N64 CIC, those are the only pictures I know of showing a decapped N64 CIC chip. I know someone called 'MooglyGuy' was planning to send all the N64 CIC's off to be decapped in June 2008:-
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://moogle-tech.com/blog/?p=62">http://moogle-tech.com/blog/?p=62</a><!-- m -->
<br />But I have not heard anything about it since <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />The PIF-NUS dump is called 'pifdata.bin' and I believe it was decapped/dumped from an Aleck64 board (Aleck64 is an arcade system that was based on the Nintendo 64 and used the same PIF-NUS chip and a CIC chip) I am not sure if its ok to post a download link here, so I have sent you a PM with a link to download the file, hope thats ok. Please note though that I dont know if its a dump of the CIC part or the boot part of the PIF-NUS chip.

<br />
<br />ok, about that:
<br />
<br />If you want to leave the original CIC in place:
<br /> - separate pins 1, 2, 10, and 11 from the mainboard. They are pretty easy to reach as they are located at the edges of the chip and are direct neighbors.
<br />An existing pin 4 mod can be left unchanged. A non-existing pin 4 mod can be left unchanged. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />If you unsolder the original CIC:
<br /> - place a 10kΩ resistor from former CIC pin 8 to GND.

<br />The rainbow mod is cool! Didn't know something like that existed.
<br />
<br />The PIC mod will also allow the user to set a preferred region. e.g. it can stay in 60Hz mode whenever possible except when a PAL game is detected. In that case it will set 50Hz mode for ~10 seconds to trick the software region detection, then switch to 60Hz.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If a replacement lock CIC autoswitches to 60 Hz after booting a PAL cartridge, can this be made an option?
<br />
<br />Autoswitch to 60 Hz might leave some games' cut scenes out of sync with the music unless the music player puts the current song position on the APU ports. A few games do region detection more often because their engines depend on the region, though this is less common on the Super NES due to its scanline-counting interrupts and blast processing, but I imagine there are still a few games that need all the vblank time.
