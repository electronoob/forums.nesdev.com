		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Can a lo rom game run on a hi rom cart if the address lines are shifted on the rom?  Or is there more to it than that?<br /><br />I have heard of a tool that converts Lo rom game files to hi rom format but I don't know if it works or where to get it.  <br /><br />Basically, can a Mario world game be made/altered to run on a ken Griffey cart (hi rom cart) or vice versa?<br />I was thinking of programming the rom with the addresses already shifted skipping A15.  So it would be an easy drop in.  Am I on the right track?  Or is it more advantageous to go from hi to Lo?  I.e. put a DKC on a Lo rom cart?   Just wanting to understand the differences between the 2 styles of carts with SRAM on both.<br /><br />Thanks!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />LoROM is emulator authors' term for not connecting A15 from the console to anything in the ROM, which the ROM's internal header indicates as mapping mode $20. So you get 32K pieces of the ROM at $008000-$00FFFF, $018000-$01FFFF, $028000-$02FFFF, etc. usually mirrored up to $408000, $808000, and $C08000. Contrast this to HiROM, mapping mode $21, which does connect A15 but doesn't connect A22. Its ROM appears as one linear region mapped to $400000-$7DFFFF and $C00000-$FFFFFF, with every other 32K mirrored down to keep the interrupt vectors available: $408000-$40FFFF to $008000-$00FFFF, $418000-$418FFF to $018000-$018FFF, etc.<br /><br />If there is only one memory on the cart (one mask ROM, no RAM), you can convert games between LoROM and HiROM by rewiring the A15 trace and then using <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=90177#p90177" class="postlink">Farid's EPROM Pin Swapper</a> to rearrange the headerless (.sfc) ROM image to take this swapping into account.<br /><br />But SRAM makes this a bit harder. LoROM usually puts SRAM in the upper part of normal address space ($7x0000-$7xFFFF), while HiROM puts it in a place reminiscent of where games for the original NES put it ($306000-$307FFF).

Or could I split the 32m rom into 4 -- 8mbit roms, do the pin swap on each of them, then re-combine them?<br /><br />One question I have is if you have a (example) Lo rom game on a Hirom cart with sram, like Mario All Stars on a ken griffy Jr cart, and I swap the address lines.  When the game writes to the sram, what difference does it make where it writes the data?  So long as when a read is asserted, it grabs the data from the sram wherever it was written to?  It may be in the wrong place <span style="text-decoration: underline">within</span> the sram but why would that matter so long as when a read is asserted, the proper data is transferred?<br />isn't the sram disabled when the rom is being read and vice versa?

I supposed A15 being skipped or not is one of those signals?  I do understand that A23 (cart 48) is the Ex hi rom pin that determines rom1 or rom2 if using a decoder (74xx139). I supposed if you had a 64mb rom, then a decoder wouldn't be needed.<br />And (correct me if I am wrong) A22 (cart 47) is &quot;hi rom&quot; normal.  So is this &quot;I want to read your contents Mr. ROM&quot; line from the console?  Same for A15 in low rom games?  And to do a lo rom on a hi rom cart, is it just a matter of grounding the mad1 pin 10 to make the changes (aside from the address line shifts)?<br />Is there documentation in laymen's terms on how the addressing works for the sram?

If you google around or even search this forum you might find something. I think on this forum maybe in a PowerPAK related thread.
