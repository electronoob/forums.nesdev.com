<br />
<br />The Frame Sequencer has a divider and a sequencer. The divider divides the 240 hz input that recives. If mode is "0", divider is set to "4", that means that the sequencer will be clocked EVERY 60hz. After that the sequencer will clock the corresponding units in steps of 60hz?
<br />
<br />Is that right?

<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">that means that the sequencer will be clocked EVERY 60hz</div>
<br />
<br />The wording "EVERY 60hz" is awkward.  Remeber that "60 Hz" is the same thing as saying "60 times per second".  The sequencer itself is actually clocked at roughly 240 Hz (meaning it gets a clock 240 times a second).  On every clock, it takes another step through its sequence and the appropriate sound sub-systems get clocked.
<br />
<br />Basically... you'll have the frame sequencer take another step through the sequence every 1/240th of a second -- if it would help to think in CPU cycles... that's about once every 7457.5 cpu cycles (1789772.7272 / 239.996 = 7457.5)
<br />
<br />If you look at blargg's APU doc (ref: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.slack.net/~ant/nes-emu/apu_ref.txt">http://www.slack.net/~ant/nes-emu/apu_ref.txt</a><!-- m --> ) he gives examples of what sound sub-systems are to be updated on each step in the sequence... for both modes.

<br />But i will try, maybe after 5 or 6 years later, i will understand that god damnd docs says. I have been studing electronics, i have some concepts of hz and counters and dividers, but i cant get all the information and "dump" it in an emulator.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The NES PPU refreshes (AFAIK) at 60Hz (or 60 frames per second). The pAPU uses these modes:
<br />
<br />- 60Hz = 1 update in a frame (read 'update' as 'clock').
<br />- 120Hz = 2 updates in a frame.
<br />- 240Hz = 4 updates in a frame.
<br />
<br />When 4017h is written &amp; set the frame sequencer, there's 4 ("normal") or 5 steps (+1), up to specific bit $80. Every step (AFAIK) takes 1/4th of frame.

<br />
<br />Im almost lost and i think is better not no waste time in me getting explaing me.
<br />
<br />MY BRAIN IS DEMAGED 
<br />i thougth i could make an emulator and it seems not, better i should to devote to  make only "hello world's" messages.
<br />
<br />anyway, thank for the help [im was going to put here a emoticon that says "ok man", i mean a pic with that rounded faces with a finger up, but this forum dont have them, so take all this braket as that symbol] <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You shouldn't give up =).  This stuff is tricky and confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it it's a snap... and it's a great learning experience (not to mention I have loads of fun with it).  If you stick with it... one day you'll be like "OOOOHhh!  That's how it works" and everything will just all of the sudden snap into place.
<br />
<br />One helpful thing I always try to do is get everything working in a common base.  Having things running at all different rates (in Hz) is a pain in the arse to track... so it helps a whole lot to keep things in CPU cycles.
<br />
<br />NTSC system has 179772.7272 cycles per second... knowing this... we can convert any other clock rate (in Hz) to CPU cycles with the following formula:
<br />
<br />1789772.7272 / Rate_In_Hz = Rate_In_CPU_Cycles
<br />
<br />So if the frame sequencer runs at ~240 Hz... then 1789772.7272 / 240 = ~7457.5.  So you'd clock the frame sequencer once every 7457.5 CPU cycles
<br />
<br />Now using a section of blargg's APU doc as a reference:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; f = set interrupt flag<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; l = clock length counters and sweep units<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; e = clock envelopes and triangle's linear counter<br /><br />mode 0: 4-step&nbsp; effective rate &#40;approx&#41;<br />---------------------------------------<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - - - f&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 60 Hz<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - l - l&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;120 Hz<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; e e e e&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;240 Hz<br /><br />mode 1: 5-step&nbsp; effective rate &#40;approx&#41;<br />---------------------------------------<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - - - - -&nbsp; &nbsp;&#40;interrupt flag never set&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; l - l - -&nbsp; &nbsp; 96 Hz<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; e e e e -&nbsp; &nbsp;192 Hz<br /></div>
<br />
<br />You'll keep a counter which tracks your 'step'.  Every clock... you'll increase that step by one -- and wrap to zero if it reaches 4 or 5 (depending on the mode -- 4 or 5 step).  When the step is 0... the sub-systems in the first column get clocked first.  Assuming mode 0... this would be only 'e' (Square 1's Envelope/Decay Unit).  When the step is 1... you clock both 'e' and 'l' (Square 1's Length Counter and Sweep Unit)
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope that clears it up a bit....  don't worry about asking questions... I love this stuff so I don't mind helping any way I can.  If you do decide to quit that's okay... but I think you should stick with it ;)

<br />
<br />That means =&gt; 341/3 CPU clock cycles per scanline.
<br />1/4th of frame implies =&gt; (341*262) / (3*4) =&gt; 89342 / 12 =&gt; 7445 cycles per frame quarter.
<br />
<br />So, you update envelope, length counters... it depends of actual frame sequencer order.
