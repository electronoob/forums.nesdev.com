<br />
<br />If my understanding is wrong, please correct me.  And confirmation where I'm right would also be very helpful.
<br />
<br />During Rendering:
<br />
<br />* $2003 writes do nothing
<br />* $2004 writes do nothing
<br />* $2005 and $2006 work normally
<br />* $2000, $2001 work normally.  As does $2002.
<br />* $2007 writes increment PPU Address like normal, but the write has no effect on VRAM (not even during HBlank)
<br />* $2007 reads get the read buffer, then fill the read buffer with $00.  PPU Address is incremented like normal.
<br />* Writing to $4014 (being a simple macro to automate $2004 writes), does the same thing as writing to $2004 -- nothing.

<br />I thought they were evaluated against the scanline Y coordinate starting at x=64, and based on such evaluation, the <em>pattern tables</em> for sprites were fetched at x=256 through 320.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Accesses to $2007 during rendering are not predictable, from what I understand, due to conflicts on the PPU address bus that come as a result.  You cannot say definitively what VRAM address will be modified by $2007 writes, nor can you definitively say what the read buffer will receive on $2007 reads.
<br />
<br />It's also my understanding that writees to $2003 and $2004 have no effect during rendering, but I don't know this for sure.  Reading from $2004 is definitely valid, returning whatever OAM data is currently being examined by the sprite renderer.

<br />
<br />Accessing $2007 during rendering is quite unpredictable, as the Address Latch Enable and Read/Write signals are controlled by two independent units within the PPU - namely, the renderer and $2007 I/O. As a result, trying to use both at once results in all sorts of weird things like asserting both /Read and /Write simultaneously (which isn't too bad, since that ends up getting treated as a write) or even asserting /ALE and /Write simultaneously (which gets really messed up, since the data being written gets pushed back into the address latch, potentially resulting in another memory location being modified).
