Well I'm finally done dumping all my carts. I ended up with 1 more with no plugin for. I had never even heard of this one, but here's a little bit about it. <br /><br />This board is quite different from other Tengen boards. Most of them use either the MIMIC-1 (337001) or RAMBO-1 (337006). This one uses one labeled 337007.<br />It has 1 128K PRG ROM and 2 128K CHR ROMs (marked CHL and CHH). The Rabbit CIC clone (337002) is not integrated into the mapper as in the RAMBO-1. There is also a 74LS02 on board.<br /><br />This board is from the game "After Burner". I looked up the existing dumps mapper number, 68, which is some little used jap Sunsoft board. Out of curiosity, I wrote up a plugin as if it were for the Sunsoft board, and luckily it works on the Tengen board.<br /><br />Anyways, <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/bootgod/800042.zip" class="postlink">here</a> is the plugin the board. It should work on the few jap carts that use the Sunsoft version as well.<br /><br />I don't have a digital camera handy, so I scanned the board. Quality is not so great though as it ended up with quite a bit of depth-of-field action.<br /><br /><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/bootgod/800042.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Btw, is this a case where UNIF should store the CHR ROM in the file as 2 parts just because it's 2 ROMs on the board?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=158">BootGod</a> â€” Thu Jan 05, 2006 9:11 pm</p><hr />
