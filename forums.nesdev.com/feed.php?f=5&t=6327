I think both FM and PCM have their own individual strengths and weaknesses. If given to the right composer, both SNES and Genesis can produce awesome music. FM however has the problem that it's VERY EASY to screw up. Many lesser tunes on the Genesis sound bad because the instruments are distorted. This is the result of a lazy composer, unwilling to spend the time which is needed to deliberately fine-tune the parameters.<br /><br />If there is one company which could handle practically every sound chip very well, it's Konami.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3760">6502freak</a> — Wed May 19, 2010 11:24 am</p><hr />

Yes exactly, SMW is the example of a game using lame samples, but it's not alone. Zelda III uses really bad samples although it has really good music. It could probably sound 10 times better with the same hardware. There is also many non-Nintendo games who falls in this category too. (Soul Blazer is one who made my ears bleed).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun May 16, 2010 12:50 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I don't see why interpolation wouldn't be desirable. You can disable interpolation in some players, and you can see how bad it sounds without it. This basically create "staircase waveforms" on samples, and sounds bad. The only samples that'd sound better without it is on saw waves and square waves.<br /><br />Maybe Cubic or Sine interpolation is better than Gaussian though if that is what you mean. It outputs better treble. But if you want higer frequencies to sound good the only way is to use a higher sample rate = more memory.<br /></div><br /><br />I don't find no interpolation bad, the opposite. With most interpolation methods you get rather muffled sound or something that is still not very bright...<br />Sinc was the only interpolation that "fixes" lows but retains highs, but it happens to be quite CPU heavy compared to other methods.<br /><br />This is all highly subjective so there's not much point in arguing about it...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Hojo_Norem wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Speaking of amps, rather than putting a lot of effort into removing filters, why don't you just turn up the treble / high freq eq on your amp?  It won't go high enough?  Then just add an external graphic equaliser separate and bump up the high freqs on that.<br /><br />There's not much effect on turning up ohighs n the EQ if there is nothing to begin with. And there's not much effort needed to get rid of LPFs, just locate some capacitors and take them out. If you just turn up highs you get nearly no difference, just possible line noise increases, nothing much more.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Hojo_Norem wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">My point about the Amiga is that unlike most other machines, the filter on the Amiga is completely optional and can be disabled and enabled in software.  By forcing the filters off the quality of certain types of sounds are degraded (more on this below) along with, more importantly, the composer's original vision.<br /></div><br /><br />Amiga has mandatory filters with cutoff a bit below 10KHz and optional filters which bring down the cutoff point to ~5KHz when enabled.<br />I could have left in the optional filter, but seems nearly all games enable it and when I listened how things were with and without, I most definitely preferred no filters.<br />I also removed filters because things were cutting into CDDA sound too. I know how my music CDs are supposed to sound and they sounded rather poor through the CD32.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Hojo_Norem wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Turning filters off degrades sound quality you here me say?  Lets take StarWing for example, a decent mix of both electronic band style music and classical orchestral music.  In my spc player I tuned the interpolation off and set the output freq to 32Kz (snes native).  Now when I hit play what I hear is sharper by a long shot but theres one large problem, EVERYTHING is sharper.  Things like bass drums and guitars and other low freq sounds get that nasty aliasing which just make them sound bad and practically kills the bass.  Putting the setting back to what I usually have them at and then pushing the treble on my amp and soundcard to the max sharpened the playback to practically the same levels with one major difference, the low freq sounds were nowhere nearly as poisoned by high freq artefacts.<br /></div><br /><br />Only thing that somewhat suffers from no filtering is the bass, percussion is something that always improves, especially if the sampels are from a real drumkit rather than synthesized (I've been in a band, I know how percussion should sound <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> I'm no trying to sound cocky here).<br />But the thing with low freqs is much easier to get around to than highs, mainly because low freqs have very high amplitude compared to all else so they're quite easy to mess with and you can pretty much smooth them out with an analog equalizer while retaining highs etc. One thing where analog definitely beats digital is equalization stuff... there's nearly no need to fear clipping on any setting as long as input signal is not too loud, that is, with decent equipment...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Hojo_Norem wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />But I'm going on alot about sampled stuff here.  I dare say that removing filters on stuff with (nealy) pure synth audio is a good thing because most of the time those filters are to compensate for usually cheap circuit design.<br /></div></div><br /><br />Filters are there to get rid of the staircase waveforms that were mentioned earlier, so as to get more natural sound... recreation filters are what they're called. As everyone have noticed, I'm not fond of them <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3483">TmEE</a> — Thu May 13, 2010 2:11 am</p><hr />

I just did some tests and listened carefully songs with different interpolations. Now that it was pointed to, it is really obvious Cubic sounds the best. Gaussian interpolation make it sounds like a lowpass filter where that "muffled" sounds comes while the cubic interpolaiton would have been perfect. This is especially noticeable in the battle music of Chrono Trigger, the drums sounds really more clear with cubic interpolation while they sound muffled with Gaussian interpolation (the drums are recorded at a rate HIGHER than 32 kHz so the sample rate isn't going to make anything sound muffled here).<br /><br />Linar interpolation sounds quite good too, but sounds terrible for high rates are arcitfacts are created, this is especially noticeable in "Slam Shuffle" or "Techno de Chocobo" in FF6.<br />No interpolation create lots of artifacts like tepples says "fake treble" or just random noise. There is also the artifact problem very noticeable in FF6.

<div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The only samples that'd sound better without it is on saw waves and square waves.<br /></div><br />And possibly certain percussion instruments with more noise than pitch.<br /><br />In the process of developing Luminesweeper, I made a GBA tech demo that played a Nine Inch Nails song while displaying a "Mode 7" (really mode 1) screen. Someone on a forum wondered why the sound was so much better than <a href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/gsm/" class="postlink">my GSM player</a>. They used the same codec, the same bitrate, and the same sample rate. It turned out that the GSM player was doing linear interpolation, while the demo was using nearest-neighbor (no) interpolation. So to explain the difference, I made this file:<br /><a href="http://pics.pineight.com/gbaforum/LOM_lerping.ogg" class="postlink">An interpolation from "The legend of MAX"</a><br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Original sample </li><li>#1 low-passed at 9 kHz, corresponding to the 18157 Hz sample rate used by GSM Player and Luminesweeper </li><li>#2 with every other sample repeated, corresponding to "No Interpolation" in Modplug Tracker </li><li>#3 convolved with [.5 .5] filter, corresponding to "Linear" in Modplug Tracker </li></ol>I guess "no interpolation" creates fake treble that some people accustomed to chiptunes might find pleasing, much like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_band_replication" class="postlink">spectral band replication</a> in mp3PRO and some AAC variants.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Hojo_Norem wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />but theres one large problem, EVERYTHING is sharper.<br /></div><br />Then perhaps Sony should have included switchable interpolation modes per channel.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri May 07, 2010 12:17 pm</p><hr />
