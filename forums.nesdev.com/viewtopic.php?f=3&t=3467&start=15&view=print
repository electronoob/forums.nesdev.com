All the N106 boards in your list have black blobs. Have you ever seen one that was in a standard DIP or Shrink-DIP package?</div>
<br />
<br />I have not, just going by hearsay on that one. Apparently there are 2 different versions of it as well, the normal one using mapper 19 and a stripped down version using mapper 210. I haven't yet assigned anything to 210 because I wanted to look into that a little more. I have a big pile of Namco games to dump here, maybe I'll get lucky and find one that doesn't use blobs.

<br />Nestopia treats Namco 108/118 games differently.  By my count, there are four different mappers related to the 108/118:
<br />
<br />* Mapper 88 ("NAMCOT 108/118") - The "normal" configuration.  Registers $8000 and $8001 work as you'd expect, but for commands 2-5, the value written to $8001 is OR'ed with $40.
<br />
<br />* Mapper 76 ("NAMCOT 108 +74LS32") - The implementation of this one is derived from the MMC3.  Writes to $C000-FFFF are ignored, and commands 2-5 select 2K CHR banks at $0000, $0800, $1000, and $1800 (commands 0-1 are useless).  I doubt that this accurately reflects hardware (seems hackish to me).
<br />
<br />* Mapper 95 ("NAMCOT 118 +A1.D5.MIRR") - Same as mapper 88, except that bit 5 of $8001 controls mirroring in commands 0-5 (similar to the T*SROM boards).
<br />
<br />* Mapper 154 ("NAMCOT 118 +A0.D6.MIRR") - Same as mapper 88, except that bit 6 of $8000 controls single-screen mirroring (like A*ROM boards).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was aware of a number of wiring differences, but I believe the chips themselves work the same.  I only switched the 108/109/118 carts to mapper 206 that were previously set to 4. The only game I've processed so far that doesn't fall into that category is Quinty, mapper 88. I'm thinking there must be a mistake in Nestopia now because mapper 88 has a 74xx32 and it's behavior is a bit different from what you mentioned. Only the lower 64K can be loaded into PPU $0000-0fff and the upper 64K can only be loaded into PPU $1000-1fff. That's probably where the OR by 40h is coming into play.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I see.  It appears Nestopia's mapper naming could use a little more work, and the implementations could be more fine-tuned.  I personally can only go by what I know, and much of what I know comes from the Nestopia source.
<br />
<br />You might want to get in touch with Marty to straighten out the Namco mappers.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just got done going thru and preparing to dump these Namco carts, I actually found 4 or 5 '106' carts that didn't use a blob for the mapper at least. It's a surface mount chip with the label '163'. Marty showed me a pic of one of these in the past, so I knew they were out there. Still have yet to run into anything with a '106' label...
