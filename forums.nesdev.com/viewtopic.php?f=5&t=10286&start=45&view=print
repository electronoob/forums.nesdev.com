		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I believe this is a fairly good example of &quot;cultural ignorance&quot; per se, where person from country X has no familiarity with the realities of country Y.  Bregalad presumably works in Switzerland, so what their laws are I have no idea, but I <strong>can</strong> tell you what the real world is like in the United States:<br /><br />Most US businesses (medium or large, but same issue can apply regardless of size) work like this: if anyone -- **ANYONE** -- catches you doing that here and reports it or if someone concerns gets wind of what you're doing, you'll either be fired or reprimanded (severely).  If you'd like to see a copy of what you sign when starting at a software company in the US, let me know and I can dig up some examples (or even scan some of my own agreements, with all surrounding context blacked out), but in most cases it states clearly that anything created by you during work hours is the ownership of that company.  Violations of that, barring pre-agreed-upon exceptions (PRIOR to signing the agreement) -- ex. working on open-source and contributing patches back to the community -- can/will result in lawsuits.<br /><br />Now, if you're inclined to say &quot;so what?&quot;, let me explain to you what really happens in this situation commonly:<br /><br />* You lose your job, so you no longer have income.  You are usually eligible for unemployment, but in the US unemployment is often too small/low to live off of reliably or for very long.  The way the system works, the previous employer can also refuse to agree to pay unemployment, and then you get to go to court to appeal that situation (this is separate from the below legal stuff),<br /><br />* The next job you apply at will ask you &quot;why aren't you with Company X any more?&quot; and you will either have to lie to them (and risk being fired and/or sued if they find out you lied -- there are many examples of this happening, even some recently at the CEO level where someone lied about their credentials), or you have to tell them &quot;I was fired for fucking around on company time&quot;.  So by doing this you risk people not hiring you for the rest of your life, hoping someone cuts you some slack / gives you a break (I've heard of some people actually pleading with interviewers as well, especially if they've been out of work for a while given these circumstances, e.g. &quot;Look I know what I did was wrong at the old job, but I REALLY need this job, please...&quot;),<br /><br />* You get sued by the company who you worked for, and depending on &quot;how&quot; they choose to react within the legal system, you may end up with police at your door one day (not kidding), and if you get hauled off to the local jail, you're also going to need a very large sum of money for bail (judges will likely consider you a flight risk given the nature of the situation; US$5000 is not uncommon),<br /><br />* You begin to undergo constant anxieties (often mental stress-related problems (i.e. health problems)) due to the amount of pressure of the lawsuit; you think about the case every day, worried sick until it's over -- you even reach a point where you're thinking &quot;I don't even care any more, I'll just plead no contest, I just want this to end&quot;.  It is not a &quot;zzz boring&quot; thing, it weighs on you constantly, you fear answering the phone or answering the door sometimes.  This goes on for months, and in many cases a year or more (US legal system is slow),<br /><br />* If you lose the case, the complexities/problems there are almost limitless,<br /><br />* If you win the court case, you're financially fucked for decades from all the lawyer fees.<br /><br />Think I'm overdramatising?  I've actually been to court vs. the state of California (this was back in 1996 or so).  I will not discuss the nature of the case or the situation -- my point is that I speak from experience.  This is what a person risks by doing that.  Of course, there's the chance the employer will say &quot;lol whatever&quot; and turn a blind eye, but if you signed what you signed, legally they can screw you.<br /><br />TL;DR -- Keep work at work, keep home (e.g. hobbies) at home.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There are several jobs where one is expected to be available in front of a PC for a particular period of time so that others can ask him questions or to fix something, but only has actual work to do for a short part of that time. Examples include front desk receptionist during the graveyard shift or (in this case) an underemployed engineer. In that case, it might be worth it to ask the boss for official permission to work on personal projects on a personal laptop during this downtime, so that copyright ownership is made perfectly clear. Or is there some prevailing corporate best practice to always deny such requests? In that case, polish your resume, give your notice, and be prepared to tell the next interviewer &quot;I wasn't being appropriately challenged in my previous position.&quot;

I can see the problem if an employee was releasing software that was based on secret information that he/she had gathered through his/her employment; or if the software is competing with a product of the employer.<br /><em>No one</em> I've ever met throughout my career works <em>all</em> the time while at work. What they do when they're not working depends on what's available to them: perhaps they take 15 minute coffee breaks, or talk about sports/cars/movies/kids/whatever, or browse non work-related websites, or make private phone calls, or play games. If they rather draw some graphics, compose music, or write code, then I don't see what there is to be upset about. But I guess it comes down to where you're working and what kind of managers you've got.

Not sure why...nobody that surfs ESPN or other non-work-related websites seems to feel that way.  I submitted a request to IT to unblock this forum for &quot;work-related technical reasons&quot; which I didn't think was *too* much a stretch since it has to do with computers, assembly language, low level hardware details, etc.  At least now I can read something that interests me at work, since I have less-than-zero interest in sports news websites.  Yes...I'm that geek.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I suppose i may be the closest to a pizza delivery driver here, haha. Not quite that bad, but you all seem to have big boy jobs that would make me lose my mind!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />I have two part time jobs, one for the luvs, the other for the bills.<br /><br />First is at a Comic Shop. I LOVE it. I've always loved comics, and for a time (i still do) was actively trying to write them. (Unable to draw a straight line with a ruler, or pay a decent artist a fee was a hinderance.) In any regards, my interest in that lead me to read alot about how the industry works, the viewpoints and needs of creators, publishers, distributors and retailers. As such I became really good friends with the owner, and as soon as I got back into playing Magic the Gathering he had convinced me to run the tournaments and with that it just kinda slowly took over. I started doing the orders for magic, then board games. I started putting in more hours, instituted a POS system, and have helped the owner with comic orders (He's a generation older than me, so he's kinda out of touch with what's &quot;hot&quot; today). I've basically become his 2nd hand, going to retailer summits at conventions and helping him institute pop culture signings (We recently had Jeremy Bulloch who played Boba Fett, and are getting Ray Parks who played Darth Maul, and hopefully getting Christopher Llyod who played Doc Brown in Back to the Future. Pretty cool, since we're a not super large town in Iowa!) As you can probably tell it's exciting and I love it, but it pays crap  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  (Comic shops, despite the popularity of the movies, are not super profitable. We have to compete with places like amazon and their profit margins are too low to get buy. This is further compounded by the fact that our stock is not returnable and theirs is. I could go into more depth, but that's probably the biggest issue.)<br /><br />My 2nd job is doing desktop support at an aerial mapping company. I got it through total nepotism, haha.  My friend worked there and he's a Linix/Server guy and they needed someone part time to help out with desktop support for Windows since that's the whole office and it was consuming too much of his time. I had actually gone to college for IT with these certified Cisco courses. It was fun, but it became clear after the first year that i really didn't want to do what they were aiming for, managing servers and databases all day. I took a programming class and it drove me mad, haha. No offense guys, I'm in total awe of your power, but it's too structured for me, if that's even the right word. Anyways, i really loved working with hardware though, had been building computers from spare parts since i was in the 5th grade at home. I finished up the courses and thought i would get a job fixing computers but that didn't happen. So there i was a decade later and took a job doing what i didn't want to do! It hasn't been too bad. I don't deal with the server stuff, mostly just fixing blue screens, and driver problems, other basic user stuff. I did however about a year ago get the opportunity to fix some monitors! I had to learn to solder, and replace caps and it was tons of fun! since then I've fixed a dozen or so tv's or monitors for friends and family and it's lead me here! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br /><br />Now as for the topic of doing hobby stuff at work, in my experience it can largely be affected by How well you and your boss know each other, and how well he understands what it is you are actually doing. Most Managers have a mind set of needing to cut money where ever they can, even if it's not necessary. They DON'T want to pay someone create a product on company dime that won't profit them. Also if they don't understand what you are doing, they could easily fear that it's malicious.

All it takes is one time the wrong person knowing what you're up to, and you could have a big problem on your hands. It's a pretty significant risk.<br /><br />And, hey, maybe it's a risk worth taking. It depends on the situation-- tepples was just coming at it speculatively, I think, but the kind of stipulations you get in a lot of work contracts very often take explicit ownership of stuff like this, and depending on the company it could be a huge risk to try and do stuff like this on the clock. (Under a lot of contracts, it's a risk to do this kind of stuff at home too. Last time I was looking for a job, I turned down an otherwise decent offer because they wanted ownership of my creative output at home as well as at work. It may sound weird, but I know a ton of people that have accepted contracts like this.)</div><br /><br />I'm pretty sure thats not legally enforceable. Not that you wouldn't have to take it to court to prove it, but still - just because its in a contract doesn't mean its enforceable. For example, in california I'm 100% sure that is totally illegal for them to do whether you signed it or not.

Coming from someone who has been through lengthy legal ordeals before, it's just best not to have court dates, attorneys (and their fees) and the mental stress associated with managing your life around such legal obstacles.<br /><br />You could hire a lawyer to defend yourself who MIGHT just have the legal know-how to protect you with the right state legal statutes, and you might have a judge that is willing to look past the fact that you willingly signed a document stating that your creative output from home and work belongs to your employer, but again the chances are slim in both situations.<br /><br />Sometimes lawyers don't show up and may even include stipulations in the contract that you signed with them that whether or not they show up their fees are not refundable.  (Hasn't happened to me, but when I was shopping around I saw some contracts like that...)<br /><br />Remember that you can amend contracts with people before you sign them.  You aren't obligated to sign anything or say anything to anyone that you do not wish to sign or say.  But if you do, you may be facing undesired consequences.  In this case, you may be out of a job, paycheck deductions, lawyer fees, and paying for other types of things to combat and relieve stress; adding up to a few thousands of dollars.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />As for what I do professionally, I work with aggressive, autistic and MR youth in a residential setting as a counselor of applied behavior analysis.  I'm in school studying religious studies and counseling to be an interfaith chaplain in a prison, nursing home, or mental hospital.
