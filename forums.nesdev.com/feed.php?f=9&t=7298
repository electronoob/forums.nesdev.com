I would guess either someone tried to repair it (and it's still broken), or less likely that someone was using it to test CPUs for whatever reason (repairing other NES's, or Nintendo arcade games that used it).<br /><br />I dunno, I kinda doubt the repair thing because the CPU isn't really expected to fail.  Nintendo service center could have done it, there were a lot of those around.<br /><br />One of the fried NES's that I got had wires on it, like a repair attempt was made at some time (long ago because it was all very dusty).  The RF modulator box on it was burned to a crisp inside, blackened on the outside.  The wires bypassed it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Dec 21, 2010 5:09 pm</p><hr />

I opened up a nes101 to find out why it wasn't powering up, the power switch had one leg burned off. Anyway, also noticed the cpu had been socketed and just wondered if anyone could imagine why?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4082">akaviolence</a> — Tue Dec 21, 2010 11:43 am</p><hr />
