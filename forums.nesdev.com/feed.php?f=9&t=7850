Yeah, magic erasers are great, I've got a big box of them.  I don't use it on anything that can scratch though.  The stuff is like fine sandpaper, using it to remove a mark on a painted wall I expect would discolor the paint.<br /><br />I looked up the Weiman glass cook top cleaner MSDS, it seems to be isopropyl alcohol with some acidic stuff (says pH is 4.2 - 5.0).  And apparently the odor is 'Apple', heh.  Definitely should clean all that residue off with pure water and/or alcohol.<br /><br />If you use an actual contact cleaner like <a href="http://www.caig.com/" class="postlink">DeoxIt</a> though, the residue left behind is a good thing because it protects it.

Cleaning the carts without opening them up is possible, but it's really hard to get good pressure on the contacts without opening the carts.  I'll finish the cleaning video later once I have the bit in hand, and strongly advocate using it.<br /><br />In the process of making a mess tonight, though, I did manage to find that my Bubble Bobble cart wouldn't work before and after cleaning.  I was like "WTF?  What's with this one cart?"  Once I inspecting the cart pins I found that two on the far edge were corroded to hell (literally the gold was missing, maybe 1/4th of a contact left on both of them!).  I would have seen this instantly had I been able to just open the cart up and clean it normally.  :-(  Must buy replacement Bubble Bobble...<br /><br />Regarding rags/cleaning tools: I strongly advocate using <a href="http://www.mrclean.com/en_US/magic-eraser.do" class="postlink">Mr. Clean Magic Erasers</a> instead of a cloth rag.  The texture/surface of them is really fine, and they hold water/liquid quite well (so getting half a side of one damp and the other side dry is completely possible).  Not a lot of pressure is needed either; they do the work for you.  A box of 4 is about $8, and should last years for anyone with a decently-sized NES collection.  I've tried the erasers out, by the way, on my Bubble Bobble cart.  (Oh, and those erasers also can do crazy stuff like clean smudges off of painted walls, and do absolute miracles on the floor/surface of a bathtub.  :-) )<br /><br />The video I plan on making will probably be for River City Ransom -- one of my favourite games of all times -- the cart of which doesn't even work any more (blinking gray screen).  Doesn't matter if I push on it, blow on it, wiggle it, whatever.  Nada.  Looking at the contacts it's obvious they need to be cleaned, so I want to use it as an example.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Sun Jun 19, 2011 4:55 am</p><hr />

The Weiman stuff solved literally both problems I was seeing with my top-loader as well as my front-loader.  The games work reliably every single time (I must've reinserted them a good 30 times), and the "jostling problem" I was seeing on both console types is completely gone.<br /><br />I'll see if I can put together a video showing folks how I did the cleaning.  I don't have one of those nice fabric "strips" that you can use to clean cart connectors (really should get one), so I've been using Q-tips, which is a little tricky with the Weiman's goop.  I then use paper towels to dry off the connectors, followed by using canned air (or just blowing) on the connector (since paper towels leave tons of crap laying around inside of the cartridge connector area).<br /><br />Cleaning carts would be a lot easier if I could open them; my NES cartridge bit is in the garage somewhere but I can't be bothered to find it.  :-)<br /><br />I'm also surprised the stuff doesn't smell that bad.  *laugh*  I expected a chemical smell -- no such thing.<br /><br />Thanks a ton, 3gengames.

Well I got everything together this evening here are some pictures<br /><br /><img src="http://www.infiniteneslives.com/img/images/72pin1.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.infiniteneslives.com/img/images/72pin2.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.infiniteneslives.com/img/images/72pin3.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />So I'll admit it's not the best solution out there.  The pitch issue I'm claiming to be a non-issue.  The only time I saw anything was when testing it out before fully assembling everything.  The mobo card edge has a little more free play and I was able to cause issues by sliding the connector too far from center.  But I slid it back and everything was fine.  So as long as it's properly aligned with the mobo during install it's okay<br /><br />It is still susceptible to dirty cartridges, I'd say it's about as good as my toploader when it comes to dirt issues.  But going though and properly cleaning all your carts goes a long way as you're all saying.<br /><br />It will play a clean game without pressing down the game to it's normal position.  Pressing the game down will help a game that's dirty sometimes.<br /><br />The thing I'm most happy with though is shock protection.  I litterally shook the thing in my hands as hard as I could and banged on the side of the nintendo case and I couldn't get it to glitch.  I tried really hard, the only way I think I could have shocked it more was actually drop it from a few feet but that would have been a little excessive.<br /><br />I tested out the toploader to see how sensitive it was to shock comparatively and it was really easy to get my toploader to glitch due to the free play koitsu was complaining about.<br /><br />It's also not very easy to assemble.  I made the protoboard a little longer than I needed to provide more support when inserting games and it made it more difficult to put everything together.  And the connectors were a little fat which caused some issues too.  But I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Sun Jun 19, 2011 1:00 am</p><hr />

I'll <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00169WXZY" class="postlink">pick some up next week</a> and give it a try.

Just pull on each end to stretch it out (slightly)?  Won't they just go back to the same tension they were before?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />You're paranoid with even the slightest movement aren't you?  :D<br /></div><br />Talking about the top-loader: :-)  It might seem like I'm being OCD ("who touches their carts once they're inserted?!") but honestly I'm not.  The problem is that many carts simply don't work until you wiggle them around or find the "perfect angle" for them to be at.  Someone bumps my table, puts down a cup of tea, whatever -- game crashes.  Serious bummer.<br /><br />Switching back to the front-loader: connector pitch (being discussed here) almost sounds like what this problem is, re: chykn stating that the cartridge connector has to be perfectly centred/aligned (vertically and horizontally).  I wonder if the connector I bought has the wrong pitch.  Hmm.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Thu Jun 16, 2011 2:28 am</p><hr />

I found that if I centered the cart in the connector, the pins will connect as expected.  But it has to be centered, and even then it barely makes contact on the outside pins since the contacts on the cart have a 2.5mm pitch instead of 2.54mm.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4242">chykn</a> — Wed Jun 15, 2011 2:34 pm</p><hr />
