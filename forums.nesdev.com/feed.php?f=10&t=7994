Thanks for the list, that G540 doesn't seem that bad actually.<br /><br />I'd try to download the software and see which ones has the preffered interface.<br /><br />And I think Willems are popular because they are cheap, and they are programmers. It's the easiest way to do stuff with programming ROM's, but it isn't a quality thing.<br /><br />And maybe a DIY project with a PIC would make a good programmer, my ada has always said he wants to make his own where you send it a chip number and a binary and it'll program it, that'd be a fine project.<br /><br />And okay, that makes sense now about thw 2.5-6.5 devices. Interesting.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Sat Jul 23, 2011 10:26 am</p><hr />

I don't think the Willem's would be so popular if they didn't work.  They're manufactured by a lot of different people, so quality control could vary though.  It's worth noting that it's not a USB programmer, it's parallel port and only uses USB for power.  If you program an EPROM you have to use a 9V or 12V DC adapter, USB power is only good for programming Flash and stuff.  It's more of a hassle to use, but is cheaper for it.  For burning EPROMs on mine I have to change jumpers on it that aren't even shown in the software.<br /><br />Here is the list of G540 supported stuff:<br /><a href="http://www.pic16.com/soft/G540_DeviceList.txt" class="postlink">http://www.pic16.com/soft/G540_DeviceList.txt</a><br />That's the first I'd heard of that one.  Sounds OK.<br /><br />I'm not sure what advantage the TOP2009 has over the TOP2004.  There really aren't new chips being made in DIP package anymore (just variations if anything), so I don't think the supported device list is going to grow for any of these.  Willem might have the advantage of more programming adapters for surface-mount packages.  But that won't matter at all for what you're wanting to do with it.<br /><br />I'd say to go with the TOP2004, or whichever is cheapest (Willem might be "too cheap").<br /><br />BTW for 2.5V-6.5V device support it's talking about the VCC voltage.  12.5V would be the VPP (programming) voltage.  A lot of 5V EPROMs, you have to run VCC at higher voltage when programming them.  My Willem does 5V and 5.6V, and I use both those settings depending on what I program with it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat Jul 23, 2011 2:13 am</p><hr />

No willems. Nothing but nightmares from what I've heard. And the one person in a blue moon that says they worked fine, but don't get a willem.<br /><br />And that top 2009 does 2716, some don't do those for some reason, so seems good to me. Also, that G540 looks interesting. I like the pin detection feature. Although with no list of what it supports or what voltage types, I'd pass on that one. I'd go with top2009 from that list, although it says it only goes to 6.5V devices in the auction, and it says it programs the 12.5V 27C(0)XX, so maybe just a typo or something weird.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Fri Jul 22, 2011 10:21 am</p><hr />

for the tl;dr crowd, my question is what ERPOM burner should I buy that would best be suited to making NES and Famicom reproductions?<br /><br />For the rest:<br /><br />This fall I will be going back to school to learn videogame programming. I realize that I'll be learning high level programming in languages such as C++, Java, VisualBasic, etc and probably not 6502 assembly, but I do nevertheless have the interest in learning assembly and more to the point of this thread, producing my own reproduction carts. <br /><br />In preparation do getting into that I have purchased several dozen EPROMs, mostly UV Erasable ones but also a handful of flash ones as well. <br /><br />Researching on my own lead me to realize 8-bit EPROMs are measured in Megabits, which are divisible by 8, so I came up with this chart. Hopefully I am not mistaken. <br /><br />27C128 = 16KB<br />27C256 = 32KB <br />27C512 = 64KB<br />27C010 = 128KB<br />27C020 = 256KB<br />27C040 = 512KB<br /><br />So what I would like to know is if someone might be able to recommend a modern, USB EPROM burner well suited for the task of making NES reproductions. <br /><br />I primarily use a imac, but do have an older circa 2004 PC with XP if needbe. <br /><br />I have pre-existing knowledge of NES boards and soldering skills to remove the mask roms in place. <br /><br />I know that eventually with the later,  more complex games, Nintendo began to use custom chips that don't match up with off the shelf EPROMs, and hence need wired cross connections. I don't plan to tackle anything like that just yet - probably stick to NROMs, UNROMs and other simple boards. I have 28 27C512 which I hope I can make SMB1 hack repros with. <br /><br />So if you stuck with me and read all this, I gratefully appreciate advice of which EPROM burner to go with, possibly where to buy it and how much I should expect to pay.
