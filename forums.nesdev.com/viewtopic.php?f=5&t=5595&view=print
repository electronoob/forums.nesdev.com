		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi I write this message from a brand new PC with Windows 7 installed. In fact it's nothing to write home about, the main difference with Windows XP is that the start menu and the configuration panel are completely f***ed up, that it does annoying so-called "security" warning for each programm you want to install (fortunately you can disable it), and that it eats about 1GB of RAM when you do nothing particular (I have 3GB so it's not THAT bad but still quite a waste).
<br />Aside of that it's your typical fully-functional and mostly user friendly windows, and you can very easily switch between the new fancy-color-transparent stuff and the good old Windows95-style look easily (I still haven't decided which one I prefer yet).
<br />
<br />Now I'm hesitant to format &amp; install XP, which has the advantage of coming with a well know good old Windows 95-style start menu and config panel, and that all divers for my PC still have XP support (I don't know for how long tough). The main con is that I'll have to make the switch anyway in the long term, so I might as well make the effort to switch right now (and please don't tell me to switch to linux, because I also have linux installed anyway and will switch regularly from one to the other - I can't just get completely get rid of Windows because a lot of romhacking/dev tools and emus are Windows only).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I find some features of Windows 7 to be a significant improvement over 2K/XP.  I particularly like the Pinning feature on the taskbar.  Given that I work for Microsoft, I had the "pleasure" of testing out beta releases of W7 where Pinning didn't work as originally intended, and I hated it.  In RTM, it works as intended, and I really appreciate that.
<br />
<br />The "Security" warnings you're talking about are induced by UAC, and it's significantly relaxed compared to Vista.  Even going into something like Control Panel -&gt; System on Vista requires manual confirmation, while most of this is relaxed significantly on W7.  I hated Vista every single time I had to use it because of that:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.neowin.net/news/main/09/01/07/windows-7-whats-up-with-the-uac" class="postlink">http://www.neowin.net/news/main/09/01/07/windows-7-whats-up-with-the-uac</a>
<br />
<br />Performance-wise, I find W7 (on my Lenovo T60p work laptop -- which means it's loaded with all kinds of corporate crap, including IT security scanners and other whatnots which slow the thing down to a crawl) significantly faster than Vista in all operations, especially disk I/O.
<br />
<br />On the negative side, the Taskbar takes some getting used to, I agree.  I also don't like how they mucked with the Control Panel -- it's inconsistent (where you find things).  But step back for a moment: how much time do you really spend in the Control Panel?  You'll spend a lot of time there initially and when setting up your PC, but after that, it's maybe a two-or-three-times-a-week thing.
<br />
<br />I also dislike W7's Aero theme (specifically window transparency), since I don't like the way it looks (plus it chews power on laptops).  But then again in XP I turn off Min/Max Window Animation, sliding toolbars, etc... just because it irks me.  OCD if you will.
<br />
<br />In general, I'll take W7 over Vista any day of the week.  Would I take it over XP?  At this moment in time, no, I'd prefer XP -- because I don't have enough experience with W7 yet (about a year, off and on).  Given that (in the States) it's difficult to find PCs with XP on them any more, only Vista, W7 will be a wonderful/positive change.  Even my mother hates Vista.  :P
<br />
<br />Will I be upgrading my home workstation from XP SP3 to W7 once it comes out?  Not until I have good reason to or I'm feeling ballsy.  I *will*, however, purchase W7 when it comes out.  I did the same for Vista Ultimate, and it sits unopened on my shelf...
<br />

When it was introducted for W95 it was a major upgrade on W3.1 and made it imediately obsolete : And almost the same formula was used for 95, NT4.0, 98, 2000, Milenium and XP. I don't know what was Microsoft thinking when they changed it this much (in a bad way) for Vista, and now 7.
<br />
<br />The security warnings are a bit annoying but again I remember when I switched from NT4.0 (aah the good old days) to 98 I found annoying that they give you a warning was dangerous when you go browse "C:\Program Files" and I got used to it. Eventually I disabled all warnings, and it's allright.
<br />
<br />Oh and I didn't mention it but I'm here on a brand new Lenovo ThinkPad T400 laptop, and I bought it without any OS on (like I ALWAYS do, I'm smart enough to install OS myself thanks). I can legally "buy" any Windows version (and even most other Microsoft software - exept games unfortunately) for $0 as a student so money is not a factor to consider when chosing my OS. All oficial lenovo drivers aren't for 7 BTW which is a bit annoying, but everything works pretty much fine at the first glare. My main issue is that the "sex touchpad scrollbar" don't work with Windows 7, they work on linux tough.
<br />
<br />You say 7 isn't out, but 7 professional is out in fact and I have "bought" it I guess it's not a beta.

It originated there, and MS chose to keep the overall style/layout.  I find it both annoying and rewarding -- I like the "commonly used" section on the left, but generally speaking I don't like the rest of it.  One thing that really upset me about Vista was <a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1362/670220152_c60b82262e.jpg" class="postlink">how the round Windows logo (Start button) on the taskbar "stuck out" above the taskbar itself</a>, hiding content behind it (since the taskbar acts as if it's Always On Top).  Microsoft did away with this silliness with W7 and I'm thankful for that.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The security warnings are a bit annoying but again I remember when I switched from NT4.0 (aah the good old days) to 98 I found annoying that they give you a warning was dangerous when you go browse "C:\Program Files" and I got used to it.

It was painful for about a year, but when Windows 2000 came out I had very little complaints -- while all of my Windows 98 friends were screaming, ticked off at how all their DOS applications no longer worked due to the kernel trapping ISA I/O port access and so on.  Don't forget that XP "hides" C:\WINDOWS by default (requiring you manually click on Show Contents or whatever).  You have to disable that as well in XP, so it's somewhat of a moot point.  :-)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Oh and I didn't mention it but I'm here on a brand new Lenovo ThinkPad T400 laptop, and I bought it without any OS on (like I ALWAYS do, I'm smart enough to install OS myself thanks).

Admittedly on our T60ps, we have what's called "full driver support", but I have no idea if they're using Vista drivers or not.  Rumour has it that you can get most (but not all) of Vista's drivers to work on W7.  Manufacturers are given regular builds of an OS during its development cycle, so the fact that so many vendors don't have W7 drivers speaks more of them than Microsoft.  Don't worry, I'm not defending MS -- I don't work in the OS division, or anywhere near it for that matter.  I'm just saying that vendors have had time to get their act together and they still haven't.  Aren't people still waiting for Creative Labs to release stable Vista drivers?  Scary.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">You say 7 isn't out, but 7 professional is out in fact and I have "bought" it I guess it's not a beta.</div>
<br />Since you just bought a new laptop, is it possible your distributor illegitimately sold you a copy of W7 OEM?  OEMs have their release, yep, but the official retail release is not available for purchase.

It's fast and responsive and I haven't had a moment's trouble with it after about a month of trying it out. At work we have it installed on a 1.5Ghz P4 with no problems. It's a major improvement over Vista and so far I like it. I like the minor tweek that did to the side bar. I like the pin to taskbar feature. I think it's everything Vista should have been.
<br />
<br />One thing I think is a big mistake however is that there is NO upgrade path from Windows XP to 7 even though brand new PC's are still sold with XP, and many were bought with XP because people didn't like Vista. That's a huge part of the market they're leaving out.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It frustrates me that we simply can't have an operating system that "flies"... When new/faster hardware is released, they make an OS that will perform in them like the old OS performed in the old machine. WTF? It's like they are saying "Yeah, Operating systems are this slow, and they are supposed to be like this on current machines, deal with it". I wish they'd run "super fast", not "just fine".
<br />
<br />Maybe they are relying on fast hardware too much. I don't know if it's just laziness or something, like they are encapsulating stuff many levels deep instead of actually coding something more efficient. 1GB of RAM for an OS is ridiculous. It doesn't matter if you have 8GB, it's still ridiculous, specially considering that XP ran pretty well with 128MB.
<br />
<br />Also, you probably noticed that they are trying really hard to take the control away from the user. I hate things like the "My Music", "My Pictures" "My Whatever" folders... Just let me store my stuff wherever I want! I do, but I still have to bump into those useless folders once in a while.
<br />
<br />Soon you'll not be able to do many tasks you could before. I heard Microsoft is using some sort of Media protection that will prevent you from running anything (music, videos) that's not digitally signed (i.e. not pirate)... So it's bye bye torrents and watching stuff you can't catch on TV for free, for example.
<br />
<br />I'm still on XP, and I hope this will be my last Microsoft OS. I'll stick to it as much as I can, but will eventually switch to Linux. I'm tired of using pirate software, it doesn't pay off anymore. And since I think the original stuff is hardly worth what they are charging (Vista I won't take even if they pay me, haven't tried 7 yet), I'll end up going the free software route.

<br />I'm testing it a little bit here and there. I still don't see the point for all the new fluff they added.  I was able to restore the task bar to work like it was before, put back the quick launch but the only think I cannot put back is the %%$#% start menu. I don't like it.  Maybe people that don't put their shortcut for their application in order may like it now that you can search in them but since I have being used from win95 to put my stuff in order... It feel useless. It's only good for people that are not organized (personal opinion here). Clicking on the folder to access your program is so slow that you almost have no choice to use the search option.  
<br />
<br />Removing the classic menu was a bad idea. My company will not switch to it because of that. They will even consider (gaps!) vista because of that! Crazy!
<br />
<br />I kept the candy colored windows except for the "make you dizzy fade-in while showing up" because if I put back the style to the classic one... What would I not be using winxp instead then?  For now I don't see any advantage for the new one. It's not like when we passed from win98 to NT.

<br />What I meant is the classic start menu, when you press the start button. You can do it in vista/2008 but not in Windows 7.  They removed it completely from the shell. So the only start menu available is the new one like vista.  I'm not a big fan of it.

<br />I got my copy of W7 that way.  The engineering faculty students here get all this microsoft software for free, the microsoft academic alliance or something.

<br />I have on my desktop the ISOs for W7 Professional, but I need to wait for Lenovo to update their Thinkpad drivers, they'll be published in a week or two and then I'm upgrading =)

<br />W7 is very efficient, there are people at university who switched to 7 on their <em>netbooks</em> because it runs smoother than their original XP installations.  If you think W7 is anything like Vista in terms of performance then you're in for a surprise.
