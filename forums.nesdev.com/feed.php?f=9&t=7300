Isn't the 2A03 also responsible for performing Sprite DMA?  If you were to swap it out for a regular 6502, and miraculously managed to make it work, games would not successfully copy any sprites from RAM to the OAM, so you'd get no visible sprites, and thus no sprite 0 hits.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Sat Dec 25, 2010 11:26 am</p><hr />

It's the same CPU that Atari had used in its Video Computer System model 2600, just 50% faster.<br /><br />There are two things to deal with: the instruction set and the microarchitecture. A modern Athlon family CPU has vastly different microarchitecture from an 8086 while using the same instruction set, involving simultaneous out-of-order processing of instructions. The 2A03, on the other hand, is gate-for-gate the same as the 6502 mask with the decimal mode circuitry disabled.<span style="text-decoration: underline">processor</span>.</div><br /><br />Along those lines, doesn't the 2A03 have additional instructions (and undocumented instructions/opcodes) when compared to the 6502A? I recall it having additions to deal with the PPU and video circuitry or something, but I'm tired and could be delirious. <br /><br />What would happen if you dropped an 6502A into the 2A03 pads and tried to run with it? Further, with the instruction compatibility of the 65C816, what if you wired one of those beasties up to the NES (aside from timing differences, anyway)? I expect that the extra instructions are mandatory, if my memory is right, to run anything graphical, but I could be severely mistaken.  <br /><br />I recall that the choice of the 65C816 over the M68000/020 on the SFC/SNES was for ease of porting titles in development (e.g. 'Super Mario Bros. 4/SMW') to the new hardware, as the '816 offers both all the 6502 instructions plus new additions in 16-it mode and full 6502 backward-compatibility mode as well. Thus, while the 68020 was a better technical choice, the 65C816 allowed for faster conversion of games to be made available at launch and was also a less expensive part. <br /><br />The neat thing is that the '816 was made up to 20MHz and is still available today for anybody twisted enough to want to seriously rewire their SNES with some extra horsepower, although it'd be entirely CPU internal, as the rest of the bus timing would rely on the original clock rate. Still, that would be neat for certain CPU rendering operations, I'd imagine, if you wanted to go nuts with it. <br /><br />Anyhow, bed is calling for me. If you celebrate something today, happy whatever-it-is-you-celebrate.

So the logic here is that because the <span style="text-decoration: underline">processor</span> technology (specifically NMOS 6502) and architecture was developed in 1975, that the system/console itself is a "70s computer"?  The fact that the console itself was manufactured and distributed in the mid-80s doesn't invalidate that statement?  Doesn't Famicom mean "Family Computer"?<br /><br />Wait, what am I saying?!?  I have no idea, I must be smoking crack, because present-day line of x86 PCs are also "70s computers" since their CPU microcode solely emulates x86 (read: 8086, circa 1978 or so).  No wait, I'm wrong again!  They're all "18th century computers", because they're using capacitors, and those were discovered during the 18th century.  Yes, the NES is an 18th century computer.<br /><br />...now, doesn't all of that sound highly pretentious if not downright preposterous?  This is absolutely a discussion of semantics, so let's reflect:<br /><br />Calling the NES or Famicom a "70s computer" because of its processor is just as accurate as my above pretentiousness.  The original statement was "70s computer", not "70s processor".  The term <span style="text-decoration: underline">computer</span> is not synonymous with <span style="text-decoration: underline">processor</span>.  The term "computer", even today, is still an appropriately vague term that means "everything inside of the box" and not "just the processor inside", and that is even more true/applicable when referring to a home video game console.<br /><br />I won't reply to this thread past this point because apparently my :o reaction has not only resulted in an semantics debate, but a completely ludicrous and off-topic one as well.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Thu Dec 23, 2010 4:08 am</p><hr />

So Class 2 is 2 MB/s, and Class 4 is 4 MB/s and so on.  a 133x compact flash card is by comparison maybe 20 MB/s.. The card that comes with is maybe 6 MB/s read and 3 MB/s write.  I'm not saying this is a perfect replacement for Compact Flash cards, but it was certainly interesting to find that the few games I tested with it seemed to work without any noticeable issues.  If the NES processor isn't actually doing any work and reads the compact flash card as if it were a parallel device, then it could be a decent alternative for people.  What max speed does the NES read a cartridge at anyways?  <br /><br />I kind of like it cause I can just push in the micro SD card and it pops out, leaving the rest of the cartridge in there.  Still, I'm no expert.  Hopefully it doesn't damage the PowerPak somehow.. though I can't personally think of any reason why it should.   Which is of course one of the reasons I posted.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4646">Reed Solomon</a> — Wed Dec 22, 2010 4:25 pm</p><hr />
