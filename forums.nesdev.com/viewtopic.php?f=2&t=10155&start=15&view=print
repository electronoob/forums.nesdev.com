		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No, it's nothing specific. I was just asking myself: Since there are some revisions of games (PRG0, PRG1), you might want to get a specific version because in it a certain bug from a previous version is fixed etc. And I wanted to know if the same is true for the NES console itself: That certain revisions of the console might be better than others because some consoles might treat certain games incorrectly or something like that.<br />That was my only motivation for asking it. I just wanted to know if something like that exists and if the consoles might differ in the same way two revisions of a game might differ.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a very old toaster NES (smooth plastic on the bottom, very low serial number) which has noticeably darker video output than all of my later models, close to that of my AV Famicom. I used to prefer using it over my other toasters because the picture looked so much cleaner (sharper edges and less fringing) on my CRT.<br /><br />My PowerPak has also exhibited different glitches on different consoles; on my AV Famicom, it shows a duplicate cursor in the main menu that jumps around erratically. This may be due to the 72-to-60-pin converter I'm using adding resistance or otherwise changing the characteristics of the data lines, though (I have a bootleg Takahashi Meijin no Bouken Jima 3 cart that has similar issues in a toaster when using a converter).

There were a few confirmations, too.<br /><br />Regarding alignment, at least for me, it seems to be more often a thermal issue. But &quot;alignment&quot; plus &quot;thermal&quot; would be code for &quot;timing&quot;, since ICs get slower as they get hotter.

With manual $2004 writes, the 6502 is doing the writes. With $4014 writes, the DMA unit is freezing the 6502 and doing the writes itself. Besides, in a DMA, the cycle prior to the write was a read of the correct value, leaving the correct value on the data bus, while in a 6502-mediated write, the previous value on the data bus was more than likely $20 for the high byte of the destination address.

Perhaps in the STA $2004 case, the CPU isn't meeting the PPU's setup and hold requirement on some alignments.
