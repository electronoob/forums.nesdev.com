		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi all,<br /><br />I'm hoping someone can give me a steer on implementing the HALT bug? <br /><br />I have had a few attempts in my emulator at implementing this but based on the results of a halt_bug.gb test rom I found at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/retrio/gb-test-roms">https://github.com/retrio/gb-test-roms</a><!-- m --> I cannot get it passing.<br /><br />The closest I have got has the results reversed from those that appear to be expected in the test rom when I run it with BGB, I don't understand why I would have them the other way round and believe I must be missing a condition that triggers the bug.<br /><br />I have the simplest implementation based on the IME flag, is this all that should trigger the bug or is it also based on interrupts being enabled in IE? <br /><br />My current attempt just has a haltBug flag that is set to !IME when HALT is called, and in my step proc if haltBug is set then it reads and executes the opcode without incrementing PC.<br /><br />The test output also raised another question, when reading the value of IE/IF are the unused bits returned as 1 or 0? The test in BGB appears to suggest that they return as 1 where as I have been storing IF ANDed with 0x1F and returning that so zero in the upper 3 bits. Should I be ORing with 0xE0 before reading?<br /><br />Thanks

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Forgive the self post but I thought I'd follow up.<br /><br />I wonder is this another of those GameBoy issues where a few people have worked it out but it's not documented anywhere?<br /><br />I have consulted some other emulators and the behaviour seems to be that if interrupts are disabled <strong>and there is a pending interrupt when the HALT instruction executes</strong> then the bug is triggered. From what I could find the docs only mention interrupts being disabled.<br /><br />Implementing the above behaviour passes the halt_bug.gb and still passes the individual instructions tests from Blargg.<br /><br />Hopefully this helps if others are trying to implement the same issue.<br /><br />Cheers

It's funny, I didn't even notice that there was a test for this (strangely without source). Tried it on my emulator, and I realized I had it implemented completely wrong... but now it's fixed!
