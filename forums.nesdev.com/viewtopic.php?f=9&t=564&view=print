I've heard that Flashrom just has to be erased in blocks, and that was the only bad thing about them. I'm thinking I should use Flashrom, because it's cheaper. But which one should I use? and what should I program it with? And where should I aquire these items? thanks.

<br />You can get cheap Flash/EPROM/EEPROM programmers here:

<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.willem.org/">http://www.willem.org/</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />If you're thinking about programming Genesis EPROMs, get the 16bit adapter for 27C160 and 27C322 whilst you're at it, you will save on shipping.
<br />
<br />You can get cheap cheap 16 megabyte (27C160) and 32 megabyte (27C322) EPROMs from here: ($5 a piece! those things are like $30-$50 new)

<br />
<br />As for chips?
<br />EPROMs costs the least, they are very cheap used, and all the used one's I've ever bought worked fine. I got all of mine surplus on Ebay or from various vendors. The only problem is, if you're doing testing, it can be cumbersome to erase and burn if you don't have a lot of chips (like less than 10 to work with). I usually have 10-20 on hand for debugging stuff, BURN, run code, thrown in eraser, grab another, rinse repeat.
<br />
<br />Flash is the next cheapest, and is probably what you should use for debugging, if you don't want to cycle through EPROMs. The pinout can be different from EPROMs and EEPROMs. Its definalty not as common to get surplus or cheaply like EPROMs though. (you can usually get pulls from motherboards at the junkyard or computer waste places). And flash has to be erased in blocks.
<br />
<br />EEPROM is the most expensive, but you can change one byte at a time (unlike flash). I'm not sure if EEPROM needs special voltages or not to reprogram???
<br />
<br />Oh, and I haven't tried this method yet, but it might work... You could try soldering a CR2032 battery to some SRAM (which is getting cheaper these days). In which you could program it (without any special voltages), and use it. You could probably tie the write pin low or high (i forgot what makes it writeable), and use it like a EPROM, EEPROM, or FLash chip.
<br />

<br />I've been able to make one for about $15.
<br />
<br />You need a germicidal bulb (quartz). here:

<br />And I bought the 4" fixture at Home Depot for $4.
<br />
<br />I put it in a metal cracker tin, and used an old timer.

I don't know, and I'd really like to. And I'm kind of confused about the whole adapter thing. Why do you need a special adapter for certain chips? I think that's stupid, and I don't know how you guys all figured this out. I think I'm going to find some reasonable Flashroms compatible with the willem whatever, and that will be good.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, it depends on what you'll use it for.  If you want to use it for testing your own programs where you'll be making changes often, I think you'd be better served by a ROM emulator or something rewritable in-system like Squeedo.  Having to swap chips constantly gets old really fast.  It's much nicer to just have to hit a key on the PC and reset the NES.  I spent $200 on the 512kB ROM emulator I have, which is a lot, but it was worth it for all the time I saved.  A cheaper one I've found since then does up to 128kB for like $89 or so.  Of course then you'll probably want to use CHR-RAM, unless you get a second ROM emu.
<br />
<br />EPROMs need UV light to be erased, so I guess germicidal bulbs are a good source of that.  You definitely don't want this stuff shining on your eyes and skin though, it needs to be enclosed in something.  Plus you have to wait for them to erase. I'm not planning on getting an EPROM eraser myself, I'll just burn those when the code is totally finalized.
<br />
<br />I don't think you'd need an adapter for EEPROMs.  The adapters with the willem programmer (and other programmers) are usually so you can program chips that aren't DIP28/DIP32.  Like PLCC and other surface-mount chips, basically chips that need a socket or other parts that aren't on the willem board.

I heard on a site that you can erase EPROMs with sunlight, is that true? and I won't be constantly putting data on a real cartridge, only when it's absolutely necissary. I wouldn't be erasing/writing to it very often. Oh my god, desoldering is a pain in the ass. I desoldered the PRG and CHR chips in one of my SMB1/Duck hunt carts, and I almost destroyed the thing! I had to drip solder in some places where I scratched apart the circuits. Okay, but anyway, I'm thinking about getting a willem 4.0 already put together, and 2 EPROMs (27C64/27C256), and will I be fine with just getting those? Will I need any dumb adapters or anything? And just a question, you don't have to answer this, but I would appreciate it. Where on the willem programmer, do you put the chip that you're programming? I couldn't find it in the pic of the willem 4.0.
