You keep the highest monetary reward, while the lower pne gets handed to the next best entry that would be valid for that prize.  Would that work?<br /><br />edit: Naturally, someone can't win two monetary prizes by getting a higher tier handed down, either. Then the lower of those two would be passed on accordingly.

Most anything else increases labor / effort on the awarding end.<br /><br />I'd say, what, $200?  <br /><br />Although multiplayer can go higher. by definition it starts at 2 players, so $200 seems like a nice round number. <br /><br />I also posted in the awards thread about <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&amp;t=17453#p221704" class="postlink">the possibility of retroactively awarding best multiplayer</a> for previous years and a suggestion on what seems like the easiest fair way to do so.

Bumping the thread cos I assume the sooner everything is posted, the more time folks will have and therefore a chance for more entries.

I know I said a couple of days, but it's been a chaotic time for some of us. I'd post a preliminary thread, but I'd like the details ironed out first.
