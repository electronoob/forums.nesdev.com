<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I have a problem....
<br />
<br />
<br />Starting out with the NES programming and such, I was learnng from Nintendoage. I've learned quite a bit about the NES from them, thanks Nintendoage, but I just feel like coming to a *actual* site with everyone mostly a programmer would be easier to debug and get help....
<br />
<br />
<br />I am trying to put a background on the screen. Alot of the code is copyed and pasted, edited a little......And thats most likely why it doesn't work....It is supposed to put a background up and have some random, odd colored tiles......Well, it just makes a blue background. I was wondering what is wrong with my code, if it is actual code, table sizes, etc.
<br />
<br />
<br />Thanks!

<br />Also why do you have 2 loops to load the tile and attribute data : since you're just loading data from ROM and copying it to VRAM, one loop can do it in one time.

<br />- Read $2002 in your NMI code to acknownledge the interupt (okay technically I think you don't have too but really it's good practice to do it)
<br />- Write to $2000 in your NMI routine to set the good nametable
<br />
<br />Note that you only have 1 tile which is not $00 so if you don't see anything fancy it's pretty normal.

You selected pattern table 0 ($0000) for the sprites and pattern table 1 ($1000) for the background. The pattern table you assigned to the background contains nothing but empty tiles, so the screen will always show the background color, no matter what you do.
<br />
<br />Set bit 3 of the value you write to $2000 to 1 and you'll see your background.

<br />You should use more than 1 emulator to test your code. You can use your favorite one more often, but from time to time you should test in other emulators too, and you should include the most accurate ones (Nintendulator and Nestopia) in that group. If you are using Linux or Mac OS you should still try to run those emulators, even if you have to use Wine or a virtual machine. Even if runs too slow, you'll still be able to catch bugs.

<br />Before my Ubuntu laptop blew up, I tried to compile and run the Linux version of Nestopia, but all it did was freeze when I tried to load a ROM. A PowerPak is cheaper than a copy of Windows to run in a virtual machine. But when my new laptop ships, I'll keep Wine in mind.
<br />
<br />But I agree with the rest of your post: A developer on Windows XP, Vista, or 7 has no excuse not to try his NES programs in Nintendulator or Nestopia. Even a nine-year-old desktop PC can run Nestopia with NTSC filter at 60 fps.

About Windows, are you really so uptight to the point where you can't pirate Windows 98, an OS Microsoft hasn't cared about for years and would likely not do anything to you even if you told them directly you pirated it? Hell, they probably don't care even about XP by now.<br /><br />Come on tepples, there's a limit for everything. The law isn't absolute, and it's made to protect the wealthy, not us. If you don't use your own discretion and break one or two rules that will never get you in trouble or hurt anyone things will always be much harder for you.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But when my new laptop ships, I'll keep Wine in mind.</div><br />I've heard some people were able to run Nestopia with it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Even a nine-year-old desktop PC can run Nestopia with NTSC filter at 60 fps.</div>
<br />Even if it doesn't run at full speed, I think people should check if it runs corectly.

If you don't use the debugger, you don't have to worry. The bebugger IS pretty neat though, so I suggest you check it out. There will be times when looking at the static code won't be enough to find bugs, and you will need a debugger for sure.<br /><br />But don't forget about the two emulators I mentioned. I'm sure you know that no emulator behaves exactly like the real console, right? For this reason, some emulators will forgive errors that the real hardware wouldn't, and you end up with a "Nesticle game" (there are a lot of those, made before it was easy to test on real hardware) rather than a "NES game". Currently, Nintendulator and Nestopia are as close as it gets to a real NES, so be sure to try your code on them, and on a real NES if you can.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Is there a depository of games here that everyone's put together?

<br />Believe it or not, we don't finish a lot of games here! Most of us are too ambitious with our personal projects, and spend years and years working on our dream games. Some just give up, others slow down, and so far nothing groundbreaking has been released.
<br />
<br />There are a few games released, mostly single-screen puzzle games, which I happen to hate, but so far it seems like the only way to get something done, picking a simple project. The only person I've seen that successfully broke the cycle of simple puzzle games was Sivak, with his game Battle Kid. It's not free though, you have to buy the cart.
<br />
<br />I hope that from now on more and more people will break free from the puzzle game stereotype, and that we get lots of new games that show improvements over Battle Kid, just as it was an improvement over puzzle games.
<br />
<br />I'll let others link you to the few finished games they consider relevant, since like I said I don't care much for simplistic games.

<br />I feel so.....Stupid everyone here has such talent with their projects, It's Amazing! Well right now, although I am new to 6502 and NES programming I am getting the jist of it. I am not new to assembly, so that is the biggest help ever. I am starting by ghetto pong (Atleast it isn't a puzzle game!) and I have 2 lines on the top and bottom, adding the score text as a background image right now.......So to acces the video ram, can you go ahead a directly just change from $2000-$2400? Or do you have to go through the PPU to access/change it? Because I am guessing you have to go through the PPU because the 2A03 isn't hooked to the same RAM?
<br />
<br />
<br />Sorry about all these technical noob questions....
<br />
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />I will keep putting the "game" revisions inside the Background fail folder above....I need to rename the files correctly XD
<br />
<br />Updating to the score version as we speak. Although I am a newb I do understand the PAL thing and it is being made to run on both regions/rates/whatever....

There's CPU memory and PPU memory, and there is no direct way for one to access the memory of the other. For communications, the PPU offers 2 ports, an address port (accessed through CPU address $2006) and a data port ($2007). Every time you have to write to or read from PPU memory you have to use those ports, there is no other way.<br /><br />Also, you can only do it while the PPU is not rendering images, otherwise you'd screw up its rendering process and the display would get all corrupt. The PPU is considered free for memory access when both sprites and background are disabled or during VBlank. Those are the only times you can write to and read from VRAM.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Im gona maybe need help later for PPU sprite overlap, that seems confusing and like I will need it.....</div>
<br />What do you mean sprite overlap? Is it to use more than 3 colors? If so, there is no trick, just arrange your sprites in a way that they complete each other to form the bigger graphic. Sprites with higher priority will stay on top of the ones with lower priority, but if you "cut holes" in the high priority sprites so that the low priority ones are visible you don't even have to worry about priority.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Okay, Next question.....What's the best way to get the PPU to not display (Or, well, display offscreen) the graphics? My pong game so far just writes $FE to every location in RAM and it's done, it seems to be okay, is it? 0_0
<br />
<br />
<br />Gawd I feel bad for bothering you guys XD
<br />
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />So when is the best/right time to change the graphics? After you tell the video to to start dumping memory from the screen in the begining of the NMI?
<br />
<br />Does storing the location where to update the screen in NMI, doe you HAVE to do it first?....Also, Does it halt the microprocessor once you do that?
<br />
<br />
<br />Edit 2:
<br />So wait, since Vblank (When the screen is done scanning verticly?) is done, it NMI's, so technicly the best time is during the begining of the NMI?
<br />
<br />
<br />Edit 3:
<br />
<br />Would code like this work if I wanted the loop to run again AFTER the NMI is done? So that it only runs as fast as the refresh?
