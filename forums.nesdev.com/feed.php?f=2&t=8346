Clearly you can have a UxROM board with support for 512kb. But you'll have to talk to BunnyBoy about the pcbs for the game then. The existing Repro boards might be possible to hand-modify to support more PRG.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Thu Nov 24, 2011 12:31 pm</p><hr />

It's definitely possible.  putting two 161s and 32s on the board basically doubling the UxROM mapper is the easiest way without thinking about what other chips would work. <br /><br />I wouldn't recommend the 377's @lidnariq is talking about.

There isn't any read limit.<br /><br />bunnyboy doesn't "officially" live here anymore.  But I think he could easily solve this issue for you and would hope he does with all the money he has to make off the game's release.<br /><br />It's true it wouldn't fit on his repropak that he uses for BKI but he could easily reconfigure CPLD on his MMC1 boards for this mapper.<br /><br />If you'd like a full schematic and list of parts I'd be happy to make it up for you.  I can even test it on the actual hardware on the NES and all if you want some actual proof it works.

Well considering you're at the end of working on BK2 it wouldn't be hard to only test on hardware and test code in tidbits on emulator to make sure they're 100% and not doing anything weird. Maybe re-evaluate your code and other data and try to cut out what you don't need. Switch to MMC1. There's lots of solutions and such. Heck, if you're going to need a board for this I'm sure you don't need that much space, maybe but a ROM on the board in the 6000-7FFF region with the extra data you need. Then you don't need another mapper, although it'll cost 1 extra 27C64.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Tue Nov 22, 2011 4:11 pm</p><hr />

I don't need 4MB...  Thankfully.  Heh.<br /><br />I want to be absolutely certain that I can make the game this way before doing it.  A 512kb UxROM game works fine in any emulator, but that's that platform.  I have tried it in the past with the extra banks and nothing out of the ordinary happened.<br /><br />By "extensive testing" do you mean playing the game through several times or something?  Or just testing things that are in the extra banks?  I can definitely divide up the data a lot more effectively if I have this extra space.<br /><br />The other (much less favorable) solution would be to change mappers...<br /><br />bunnyboy where are you?  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3374">Sivak</a> — Tue Nov 22, 2011 3:21 pm</p><hr />

Expanding UxROM to 512KB is not as trivial as going from 128KB to 256KB... To index 32 banks you need 5 bits, but the chips commonly used for bankswitching in UxROM carts can only work with 4 bits. If you (or whoever is making the carts) are willing to use 2 extra chips, or use different chips that can work with more bits, then you could go as high as 4MB of PRG-ROM.<br /><br />About the Flash memory, I'm pretty sure that reading doesn't reduce their life span.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Nov 22, 2011 1:01 pm</p><hr />
