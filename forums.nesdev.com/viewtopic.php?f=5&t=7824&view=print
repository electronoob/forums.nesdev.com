		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd prefer files release first, cartridge release with some extra content next. By extra content I mean intro sequence, nice game selection menu with music, etc. Something like the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBXGK2mPxC0" class="postlink">famous</a> one.
<br />
<br />If cartridge release first, files next, I think there should be certain goal, like number of copies sold, that could be reached in short time.
<br />
<br />I absolutely would not like to wait a long period of time, like few months, before files release. If such a thing is required, this had to be clearly specified beforehand, in the rules (but in this case I'd skip the compo).
<br />
<br />My main reasons to enter any compo is to get more attention to a release and to get more feedback. If I spent a lot of effort to make an entry in time, and then instead getting of these two things I have to wait for indefinite period of time (which I was not warned beforehand) I would not enjoy this at all.

<br />1. Probably not, maybe as a last resort.
<br />2. Price has not been set, we are currently checking into pricing.  We do not plan on using donors for this so it would require buying cart plastics.
<br />
<br />It seems like the overall response is to post em up.  I'm off work tomorrow and the next day, so I'll have something up by then.  Perhaps I'll just list the games in the directory, then finish up the website.

<br />Has anyone found a source of plastics besides bunnyboy?  I would really like to put a 3d printer together someday and print off my own.  They wouldn't be as clean or nice as his, but still cool in a DIY kind of way.

<br />
<br />I'd either buy a lot of $2 donors or just pay the $4 for his nice cases, I don't think that it's that big of a deal. When the molds cost like $5000+, I don't think many others have a reason to invest when they can get them from him.

<br />
<br />Yeah you're right $4 is a pretty good price.  I still think it would be cool to make my own though but that's probably just me <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />To me this is what it really comes down to, but my two cents: I'm more of a try-before-you-buy person. If I want to buy it, I will, even if there's a ROM available. On the other hand, if I'm not planning on buying it, but I can play it free, and it turns out I really like it, I might then consider buying a cart.
<br />
<br />That said, I know not everybody operates that way.
