Is there a way to pad the file to like 2 megs?  (Or split the file into A/B and just pad those files up to 1 meg size) would the game still work?  Thanks!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, there are a few ways to pad the file depending on how the game expects the board to map ROM:
<br />
<br />-The mirrored memory way: this is caused by both ROMs being selected from the same decoder. Because the second ROM is smaller than the first ROM, but is still selected in the same size window as the first ROM, it will ignore the more significant address lines and appear mirrored. To fill the 0.5MB with mirrored data, just copy the last 0.5MB from the 1.5MB file and paste it at the end. Likewise if you have a 12M (1.25MB) game, copy the last 2M four times until it fills up 16M (2MB). On the few SNES boards I've seen, this is how they handle unmatched ROMs.
<br />
<br />-The open bus way: this is caused by one ROM being selected by a memory decoder, and the second (smaller) ROM being selected by another decoder. From 1.5Mb onwards (probably until 2MB) the values will be "open bus" as a result of nothing responding to that address range. To fill the last 0.5MB with open bus, you'll have to ask a SNES expert who knows what to fill this with. I believe very few games use this method, and do so as a form of copy protection.
<br />
<br />-The don't care way: most games just won't care what memory beyond 1.5MB will be, you can fill it with whatever you want because they never access it.

<br />
<br />Or could I pad the file to 2 megs, and then split the rom and burn the chips that way?
<br />
<br />What program/how would I do this?  Thanks

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you want to pad your rom with zero's. You can use ucon64 to do it and then split it into two 8mbit files.
<br />
<br />ucon64 -p rom.smc (do this 4 times)
<br />
<br />ucon64 -s rom.smc (do this after the desired size is reached)
<br />
<br />
<br />If you want to mirror the last chunk of the rom, use snestool to split the rom (8mbit split size). You'll get two files: rom.1 (8mbit) and rom.2 (4mbit). Make sure you use "delete header" on rom.1 before exiting. It will also automatically delete the header on rom.2 as well. Finally do this in command prompt:
<br />
<br />copy /b rom.2 + rom.2 rom.2+2
<br />
<br />Rom.1 and rom.2+2 should be suitable for burning onto 8mbit eproms.

Emulators don't usually emulate address wrapping and such... at least not MD emulators.

<br />All but ZSNES do for the SNES. It's left out there as a speed optimization.
<br />
<br />bsnes and SNEeSe also emulate the odd quirks like the new instruction stack wrapping bug in emulation mode.
<br />
<br />Anyway, older emulators had copy protection issues in games like MMX. Pad with the last 4mbits doubled. This is what all emulators do now, and I've not heard of any games not working as a result.

<br />
<br />But if you are using a 2MB chip anyways, you might as well duplicate the last 512k, it wont hurt

<br />I am curious, which games DO need mirroring?

<br />
<br />Some games display a nasty message when you start it up with the wrong SaveRAM size. Maybe this is the only thing they look for, since it depends on hardware only and ROM mirroring is easy to fake.
