		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello again, I just finished up adding auto-fire support to my emulator, and decided to test the effects of a super fast auto fire frequency on various games (for amusement and curiosity).
<br />
<br />My auto-fire is currently toggling the button being pressed/released each time the joypad state is read from the software, as long as the corresponding keyboard key is being held down.
<br />
<br />In most games (Mega Man series, Contra, etc), this causes no visible issues. But that story completely changes with Batman. If I dare touch an auto-fire mapped key, the OAM gets corrupted. If I hold it long enough, Batman crashes entirely. Even more strange is that only Batman's sprites are changed, all other sprites (enemies, items, etc) remain as they were before the corruption. As you can see <a href="http://i1132.photobucket.com/albums/m580/beannaich/BatmanGlitch.png" class="postlink">here</a>.
<br />
<br />Can anyone confirm that this is a bug with the game, and not my emulator? I know Batman uses the DMC, could this be an unintended consequence of the way the game reads it's pad data to ensure DMC DMA doesn't interfere?

<br />Yes. Actual turbo controllers use an oscillator to turn the button state on and off, which is tuned somewhere between 15 Hz and 30 Hz. If you toggle for each cycle of the strobe, the game will keep rereading, comparing, finding a change, and assuming it was a bit deletion due to DMA. What happens if you try your current turbo code with the following games? <ul><li>Super Mario Bros. 3 (Nintendo) </li><li>Tetris (Nintendo) </li><li>LJ65 (Pin Eight) </li></ul>

<br /><a href="http://lj65.org/" class="postlink">LJ65</a> is a homebrew tetromino game, sort of like Tetris but with faster control feel.
<br />Try changing your turbo controller to toggle the button states after every vblank and then re-run your tests.

Batman (And only Batman's sprites) glitch when you toggle $4016 too fast, seems weird, but it probably makes sense if you look at the assembler code.
<br />
<br />Also, could we get the controller page on the wiki updated with the auto-fire information (The part about the oscillators working at 15-30hz)?

<br />As for how Batman screws up: I haven't traced it, but I imagine that rapidly toggling the button will cause certain parts of processing to overflow available frame time, and an incomplete display list gets copied to OAM during the next NMI handler.

<br />It would make sense that the actual sprites for batman aren't determined until the joypad state is known. in-case of jumping, attacking, etc. wouldn't want to do more than one DMA in-case your prediction is wrong <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

When the game crashes, the swap never occurs, and Batman is rendered using the health bar graphics. The same effect can be observed on a top-loading NES or Famicom by holding the Reset button.

The magic number for this seems to be 3 reads. 2 reads works for some games, but not for games like Contra, where as every read breaks Batman and SMB 3, but doesn't break games like Mega Man 1-6. 3 reads seems to be the number that works for all games, while still maintaining the quickest possible toggle.<br /><br />Sure, I could emulate this the way it's actually done, and it would work reasonably well, but the way I'm doing it now is much more efficient at it's job. Sometimes accuracy takes a back seat to function, though I may end up adding an option to switch between the two rapid fire behaviors, because I know some people want the most accurate operation.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">MottZilla wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Still it is an interesting thing to see.

<br />I fully understand (I think) why this bug occurs, if you had a controller toggling the state as fast as I was on a real NES, I am almost positive the same thing would occur. But it is indeed interesting what happens, as stated earlier if you do this with SMB 3, it slows down to around half it's normal speed (The happy calypso music sounds eerie as hell at half speed, believe me!). Then when you let go of the rapid fire, the game just crashes entirely, and the screen looks weird, almost as if the scroll register is being written to mid-scanline each scanline.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't understand what you mean by it's so fast. The fastest you can push a button is 30 times per second, every other frame the button is pushed, and on the ones between it is not pushed. This is as easy as having a frame flip-flop variable. 
<br />
<br />I understand why you are doing it this odd way since it is I suppose quite easy to implement but given that it will never be perfect or work right for all games, implementing it the right way (30 or 15 presses per second) is a better idea.
<br />
<br />The reason Batman and SMB3 have odd behavior and crash is most likely because normally after a couple attempts to read consistent controller data it will succeed and continue on. But with your impossible situation (no rapid fire controller would toggle faster than 30 presses per second) it keeps trying to get the valid controller data, well past the time allotted for it. It may crash because whenever you release the button and allow it to get valid data the current scanline it is on may be vastly different than what it should be. Or the huge delay may have caused somehow program banking register or other program flow errors so it crashes. 
<br />
<br />Believe me, this wouldn't happen under any normal circumstances on real hardware. To get this to happen you would need faulty controllers/controller ports, or a specially programmed device to feed such bad data into the ports.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@MottZilla, I think you're misunderstanding me. What I stated is, if you had a controller that does what my current controller does, only in reality, and plugged it into a real NES, that it would behave the same way when the auto-fire button is pressed. Also, both implementations are easy, so it's not a question of the path of least resistance for me. In my emulator, I can hook all sorts of events, one of them being a "FrameRendered" event. If I wanted to, I could easily just hook my auto-fire state switching method to that event, and voila.
<br />
<br />@tepples, I'd love to see this actually done, but it seems like too much effort just to prove a point. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
