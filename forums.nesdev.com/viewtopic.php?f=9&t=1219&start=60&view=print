		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Speculation based on loopy's data: the nes CIC patent is correct: the clock is divided by four before it is used by the chip internals.
<br />according to the patent:
<br />phase 1(0) = cpu reads input
<br />phase 2(1) = arithmetic operation 1
<br />phase 3(2) = arithmetic operation 2 or continuation of 1
<br />phase 4(3) = cpu sets output (external lines come active on the ?falling edge of this clock? according to column 5, line 35-40 in the patent)
<br />my guess for the first cycle of the cic based on the patent is it reads pin 5 and does a conditional jump (or less likely, a variable set) depending on whether it is a lock or key. I can't tell much else.
<br />
<br />Also the preamble transmitted by the master? cic seems to be for both key specification (i.e. master provides TWO 4-bit numbers to the slave, one is 'my key' and one is 'your key', hence how both know which key the other is sending to compare to) and to phase-desynchronize the slave cic to it somehow, because if both chips were running at exactly the same phase, the patterns of ..0001332000.. we see wouldn't show up, they'd be ..000333000..

<br />I do appreciate the data already posted but I'll need more to try to brute force this thing.  I don't have the neccessary equipment to record the pulses or I would be working on this on my own.

<br />
<br />I doubt that the misalignment between the two CICs (the "013320") has any significance.  It's probably just a side-effect of how the chips get synchronized (one happens to be one step off).  My guess is the CIC follows a procedure like "Write output; Read input; Wait a cycle; Clear output"), where the setting and clearing of the output data occur three steps apart and the reading occurs in the middle.  As long as the middle read occurs while the other chip still has valid output, the system will work even if the chips are slightly out of alignment (which is obviously the case).

<br />It would be very interesting to know how the CIC works.
<br />A very good start would probably be to dig out all information on 
<br />4 bit micros around that time and then write dissassemblers for them.
<br />Assuming the bitordering is done correctly it would probably 
<br />show right away, as long as it's not a custom type cpu.
<br />If the instructions makes any sense it's probably a candidate cpu.
<br />
<br />It could be as the maincpu of the gameboy, a standard cpu (in this case z80) but modified to a certain degree.
<br />
<br />I tried to look up some datasheets of old 4 bit micros, but it's really a jungle.
<br />That im limited to a 56k modem at the moment doesn't really help either -_-
<br />
<br />One way might be to try to find docs of who were nintendo partners at
<br />the time, possibly numbers. As CICs were included in about every game,
<br />it would probably showup somewhere.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello,
<br />
<br />Sorry for the long pause.  Cherryroms is down, so I guess I'll continue this here. (Grrr... I'd like to be able to see my old posts/thoughts/work)
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.neviksti.com/CIC/tengen/">http://www.neviksti.com/CIC/tengen/</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />as the name suggests, this is the tengen CIC.  I believe this is currently our only real hope of figuring out the program.  The first thing is to identify the core used here (it is indeed something from Motorola, and appears to be 4-bit according to the SRAM organization).  So have at it!
<br />
<br />
<br />I have access to a much better camera now (for those that remember what the other CIC pictures looked like).  I love the old chips, it is so easy to see everything! These pictures were taken with only a 100x lense.  The next one is 500x, and I wasn't willing to take 25 times as many pictures as this alone took me two hours, so this is it for resolution.  You can make out almost everything, so I think it will be okay for those that wanted to "trace" the circuit.
<br />
<br />Reminder, there are three layers here:  (top to bottom) metal, poly-silicon, bulk/silicon surface (you can sometimes make out the edges of the different doping regions).
<br />
<br />
<br />I'm tired and think I'm done for the night.  Can someone please combine these into a nice "one large picture", and maybe a shunken/overview version of that as well?  It would be quite helpful.
<br />
<br />I took the pictures snaking my way down the chip (ie every picture is adjacent to the last one), like this:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">--------+<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />+-------+<br />|<br />+-------+<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />+-------+<br />|<br />... etc<br /></div>
<br />
<br />If you put the pictures together, you can upload it to a ftp space I setup here for everyone:
<br />ftp.neviksti.com
<br />user: CICpub
<br />pass: pub987A
<br />
<br />
<br />I'd also like to get all the CIC information people have into one place, so please ... if you have anything you think may be useful, please upload it for everyone to be able to read.  Now that I have a bit more time, hopefully we can work together and figure out the mystery of this chip.

<br />
<br />I also depackaged a 6113A and 6113B1 (from US cartridges).  I didn't take time to look at them under the microscope yet, but the B1 is smaller than the A.  So it is probably just the same exact circuit and code, just taking advantage of newer fabrication technology.
<br />
<br />And one last thing, I can see details much better than the camera made out, so I will hold off on trying to read the ROM in case people need to see a small portion better (because I have to etch away all the upper layers to get at the ROM ... in other words, if you have questions, ask them now as there is no looking back).  I won't have time to try reading the ROM for awhile anyway, and if people want me to hold off even longer, of course that is fine as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just shooing from the hip here (like I always do):
<br />
<br />Is it completely out of the question to attempt to emulate the chip's actual function based entirely on the physical model of the chip?  I mean, if all the transistor junctions are visible, then it's technically as good as a *really* hard to read schematic, right?
<br />
<br />Of course the hard part would be automating the translation of that image data, as I'd imagine that doing it by hand would be far to error-prone.  It would take some juggling of the contrast of each layer to bring out the right features, and then applying some image analysis.
<br />
<br />I wouldn't expect to get a 100% perfect emulation out of such a thing.  Instead, maybe something that can at least behave like a state machine, so the inner-workings of this thing can become a little more scutable.  I'd suspect that things like on-chip inductors, capacitors, transistor switch timings (and god only knows what else - I'm no EE) would keep a few things out of reach, but the rest is doable IMO.

<br />
<br />The ASIC in picture 4 isnt promising, but it could just mean its standard micro inside custom package.  I think the assumption has always been it was an 8 bit cpu because of the link to motorola.  Mapping out every transistor will be crazy time consuming but could be the best option.  I cant recognize transistor/gate structures, anyone have links to tutorials?
