<br />Absolutely correct. It's harder to see said crosstalk in a non-interlaced signal that conforms to the NTSC standard since it doesn't crawl but rather it flickers at 60Hz, but it's nonetheless there and a trained eye can see it (I myself have witnessed this looking at the output of my Commodore 128, and it's not even standard-conforming). It's not a factor of how the signal is generated but it's an inherent limitation of the signal itself. That's why S-Video was invented, to keep the two signals separate and thus prevent any crosstalk. You still have lossiness because U and V are combined into one signal but you don't have UV bleeding into Y and vice-versa.

But you don't agree with tepples that poor band-limiting is the <em>only</em> reason why artifacts appear.  Would that mean you would agree that <em>inherent</em> imperfection of chroma/luma separation is the main cause of artifacts from the NES's video signal - and any other color composite signal?<br /><br />It seems that a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_crawl" class="postlink">Wikipedia article</a> on dot crawl may agree with that statement:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Dot crawl can be greatly reduced by using a good comb filter in the receiver to separate the encoded chrominance signal from the luminance signal. However, the only complete solution to dot crawl is to not use composite video, and to use S-Video or component video processing instead.</div>
<br />
<br />Also, unless you agree with tepples on this, what do <em>you</em> think Nestopia's NTSC filter attributes - Resolution, Sharpness, Color Bleed, Artifacts, and Fringing - correspond to on pixel clock conflict between NTSC standard and NES, how the NES combines luma and chroma, how the TV attempts to separate luma and chroma, and how the TV filters the video signal?
<br />
<br />I'm still curious as to what are good examples of games that look better with NTSC artifacts - I never really intended this thread to turn into this debate.  XD

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry, regarding the "pixel clock" error, I meant conflict between the NES's pixel clock and the NTSC colorburst; that was mentioned in Brad Taylor's PPU document:
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You see, a 3.58 MHz signal, the NTSC colorburst, is required to be modulated <br />into a luminance carrying signal in order for color to be generated on an <br />NTSC monitor. Since the PPU's video out consists of basically square waves <br />(as opposed to sine waves, which would be preferred), it takes an entire <br />colorburst cycle (1/3.58 MHz) for an NTSC monitor to identify the color of a <br />PPU pixel accurately.<br /><br />But now you remember that the PPU renders pixels at 5.37 MHz- 1.5x the rate <br />of the colorburst. This means that if a single pixel resides on a scanline <br />with a color different to those surrounding it, the pixel will probably be <br />misrepresented on the screen, sometimes appearing faintly.<br /><br />Well, to somewhat fix this problem, they added this extra pixel into every <br />odd frame (shifting the colorburst phase over a bit), and changing the way <br />the monitor interprets isolated colored pixels each frame. This is why when <br />you play games with detailed background graphics, the background seems to <br />flicker a bit. Once you start scrolling the screen however, it seems as if <br />some pixels become invisible; this is how stationary PPU images would look <br />without this cycle removed from odd frames.<br /></div>
<br />So how does this come in play in fringing?  Would that mean fringing is based on both "natural" cross-color artifacts and this quirk of the PPU's video signal?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Taylor's document uses some very weird terminology.
<br />
<br />In standard NTSC, one scanline holds 227+1/2 cycles of the color subcarrier (not the "burst" --- the burst are the 8-12 cycles during the back porch when the subcarrier is not suppressed). That means that the color subcarrier phase will be 180 degrees different from scanline to scanline, and field to field, causing any artifacts to be opposite from scanline to scanline and field to field, appearing as a two-stage dot crawl (0°, 180°) upon closer inspection, but canceling each other out over two (2) fields when viewed from a distance.
<br />
<br />On the NTSC NES, one scanline holds 227+1/3 cycles of the color subcarrier. That means that the color subcarrier phase will be 120 degrees different from scanline to scanline and field to field. This means that it takes three (3) fields for any artifacts to cancel each other out, making for a more visible three-stage (0°, 120°, 240°) dot crawl.
<br />
<br />That's why the PPU makes only one particular scanline, only during every second field, longer by one pixel, so that while there are still three positions of the subcarrier from scanline to scanline, there are only two stages (0°, 240°) from field to field, causing a less fidgety "dot jitter" instead of "dot crawl" at the expense of artifacts not canceling each other out over time. 
<br />
<br />At least one game (Battletoads) manages to bypass that extra pixel, allowing you to see the original three-stage dot crawl.
<br />
<br />In the PAL NES, there are also three stages of the color subcarrier from scanline to scanline, but its phase is LOCKED from field to field, causing any artifacts to be unchanging and thus very visible. 
<br />
<br />None of this is adjustable by the NTSC filter.
<br />
<br />In short: for any given spot on the screen, the color subcarrier phase and thus the kind of artifacts, will be from field to field:
<br />
<br />Standard NTSC: 0°, 180°, 0°, 180°, 0°, 180°...
<br />NES normal: 0°, 240°, 0°, 240°, 0°, 240°...
<br />NES Battletoads: 0°, 120°, 240°, 0°, 120°, 240°...
<br />PAL NES: 0°, 0°, 0°, 0°...
<br />
<br />Whereas the color subcarrier phase will be from scanline to scanline:
<br />
<br />Standard NTSC: 0°, 180°, 0°, 180° ...
<br />Any NES: 0°, 120°, 240°, 0°, 120°, 240°...
