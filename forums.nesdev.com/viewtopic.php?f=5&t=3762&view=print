		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><strong>*SPOILER WARNING*</strong>:  Be <strong>very</strong> careful here, if you didn't finish the game, <strong>DON'T</strong> read the list and the stuff under that.
<br />
<br />Recently, I finished <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Slader_Glory" class="postlink">Metal Slader Glory</a>...it's one of my favorite NES games!  The music is awesome - but IMO it has the best NES graphics EVER.  I mean, it looks so gorgeous that it's almost a bit frightening at times... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />  Even though it uses MMC5, it doesn't use ExAttributes like Just Breed does - but even then, IMO Metal Slader Glory's graphics look superior to Just Breed - but it <em>does</em> use MMC5 for extra CHR ROM and extra 8x16 sprites.
<br />
<br />The problem is...I have practically no clue on what's going on.  And the plot looks really awesome, too...<img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" />  Some of the drama is seriously ruined since I don't know what's happening.  Even doing some research on the Internet, looking at the SFC remake's official website and a Japanese fansite (I used Google to translate it), I'm still pretty clueless about the flashbacks and the plot around the middle and end of the game.  :/ 
<br />
<br />Anyone here give a good plot summary of the game?  I'm particularly interested in *SPOILERS*  :
<br /><ul><li>What happened to Azusa (the hero Tadashi's sister) when I believe Sayoko (the woman that's really a monster) abducted her?</li><li>What's with the flashback with a younger Azusa and some person crying?  It's when Azusa comes out of nowhere while Tadashi correctly accuses Sayoko of being a monster.</li><li>What's with Tadashi and Azusa's father?  I've read that there's some secret stuff around him from the Japanese fansite.   <strong>EDIT:  I sort of found this out - Masadata Himukai used Glory during the war.</strong> </li><li>Why is "Azusa" the password for one of the disks Tadashi needs to enter in Glory for the "ULTIMATE WEAPON" to destroy the enemy fortress?</li><li>What's with the monsters?  What are their goal?</li></ul>
<br />If you're wondering about what I'm talking about...Tadashi is who you control and is the guy in the cockpit in the intro.  Azusa is the blond girl, you can see her when you start the game.  Glory is the robot in the intro.  To find Sayoko, you need to get a little more in the game - she's the creepy-looking black-haired woman working as a secretary for the blond woman with the fancy music.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There's a <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/snes/file/579658/33482" class="postlink">walkthrough for the SFC remake</a>, so I used that.  It did help me learn a few bits about the plot, but unfortunately, not everything is completely compatible with the FC version, it doesn't say anything explicit about the plot, and it only shows one path, but there are a few extra possibilities - I have yet to know what to do for those.  
<br />
<br />Speaking of translation, I think Metal Slader Glory <strong>badly</strong> needs to be translated - a lot of the plot is lost, and its a very plot-driven game, so it sort of ruins it a bit.  Hopefully, Nintendo could consider translating the game to the Virtual Console, the JP FC version is going to be released on the Virtual Console.  If they could bring and translate a Japanese game like N64's Sin and Punishment, maybe there could be a possibility that it could hit the US Virtual Console.
<br />
<br />Also, when you play the game with an emulator, <strong>avoid FCEUxD</strong> and probably other FCEU variants.  In the flashback cutscenes and I believe the credits during the plane ride, there are three screen splits - two text boxes on top and bottom, one film box in the middle.  The problem is that the lower text box looks garbled and the lower half of the film box is messed up.  I think it might have something to do with FCEU incorrectly emulating the "disable rendering -&gt; restart IRQ counter" quirk - maybe it only restarts the IRQ counter once from the upper text box -&gt; film box.
<br />
<br />What is far more significant is that this might be the reason why a certain scene in the middle-end of the game fails to play through, and stops the game from continuing on - so with FCEUxD and maybe other FCEU variants, that's as far as you can go without a password ahead of that.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  I had to restart the game in Nestopia because of this - it works perfectly fine there, except for some minor mid-frame palette-writing quirks during the car driving scene - but that could be on HAL's part instead of the emulator.
<br />
<br /><strong>EDIT:</strong>  Regarding passwords, they <strong>do</strong> work - if you translate the romaji to hiragana properly.  I didn't do it properly, but I used an online romaji to hiragana converter to get the correct password.  So they do work, my bad.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />
