Really bizarre that there are 3 versions of it? The musicruise looks like it fades the channels at different rates. The triangle not at all (just cuts off at some point), the noise much more slowly than the rest, DPCM immediately. I don't hear any change in tempo.<br /><br />What do you need &quot;exact rate&quot; for? (And if you need that, why can't you determine it yourself?)

In this application of a fade, there needs to be some means to let the player know that the piece has ended and that if the track continues to play, all channels will remain silent until the emulated machine loses power. I mentioned NSF 2 as such a means.

I've noticed a habit on some forums of people reading only the latest post and replying only to that post while forgetting a detail that was mentioned earlier.<br /><br />To my previous point: I'm just curious as to what such a fade would be used for in an NSF as opposed to in a game. A game would add a fade when preparing to stop and transition to a different track. A composition in a format with track lengths would add a fade at the start of the third time through the loop.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes. Values from 00 through 7F produce triangle channel volumes approximately equal to pulse channel volumes F through 7, respectively.<br /><br />However, every time you change the volume, there will be a quiet click proportionate to the amount of change; some people on the famitracker forums have used 8- or 132- long DPCM samples, all +s or -s, to control the volume in a more continuous (and higher frequency) manner, however <em>those</em> produce quiet but audible &quot;zipper&quot; sounds.<br /><br />The unique volume level comes from the NES APU's non-linear mixing, which in turn comes from misusing MOSFETs. (How much detail do you want?)
