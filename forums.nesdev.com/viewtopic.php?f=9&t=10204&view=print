Was wanting to &quot;convert&quot; the Japanese NES of super Mario bros 2 Jap (lost levels) to a pc10 cartridge.<br /><br />And has anyone tried converting the super Mario unlimited (hack) to a pc10 cart?<br /><br />I am late to the game but about a year ago, I started learning about the Snes but I really know very little about the NES.    <br /><br />Any help is appreciated.<br />Thanks<br />Mark

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The easiest way to put a Famicom game on a PlayChoice is to find a PlayChoice on the same or a nearly identical board. For example, Contra (U) is UNROM (2). Replacing the ROM and the 74LS32 (or is it 74HC32? I didn't do it myself) allowed it to run the 2011 homebrew multicart, which was made for UNROM (180), at Midwest Gaming Classic 2011. But SMB2 (J) is a disk game that wasn't among those that got a rerelease on Famicom cassette in the early 1990s (e.g. The Legend of Zelda).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a NES cart that is the smb2 J<br />It is not original but someone did a rom swap and some rewiring.<br />So I wanted to port that to the pc10 as well as some of the smb hacks.  Fwiw, I have done some basic rom swaps to make baseball into Galaga and similar.<br /><br />I'm just unfamiliar with all the different cart variations, names, etc

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Like tepples said, you're going to need a Playchoice game board with the same hardware setup as the SMB2j hack.  For example, if it's MMC3 with WRAM and CHR-ROM (I don't know if it is, just an example), then US SMB2 or SMB3 may be a candidate.  Technically you won't need to add wires or do major surgery to the board, because most (all?) PC10 game boards can accept EPROM or MaskROM.. but.. there are a bunch of jumpers that you'll need to resolder, or disconnect (with a knife if it has a 'default' setting - i.e. a small trace that shorts the jumper).  I don't know if anyone has ever documented which jumper is what, exactly.  If your game board is already set up for EPROM, that makes it easy.  Then you simply put the EPROM(s) in the socket. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Anyways, the other option is to use a cartridge adapter.  A guy called '2600' makes one, AFAIK it's not on any website, just on the KLOV forum by pre-order.  You have to replace the system ROM on the PC10 mainboard.<br /><br />I was also going to produce an adapter of my own, I had prototyped the board a while back but have yet to implement the logic (uses a CPLD).  My design is supposed to emulate the so-called 'security' chip on the board, so it works with the original system ROM, can use the game instruction screen, uses NES or FC carts.  I want to finish this thing up eventually, I've just been doing other projects and stuff.
