I don't know, but given that PC-Engine DUOs often go used for anywhere from $150 to $300 I don't think price is a huge concern. I forget exactly what I paid for my refurbished DUO-R with RGB mod, over $200. There are people that would pay for a PC Engine with SuperGrafx and Arcade Card compatibility built in, so long as the cost wasn't astronomical.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Mon Sep 05, 2011 8:42 am</p><hr />

You're correct about that. It's just a shame that many clones are poorly constructed with the mentioned problems. <br /><br />About the TG16/PCE, it's a shame no one has yet cloned it. Probably due to its lesser popularity and also because it would be wise to clone the CDROM too given the number of great games that are CD or Super CD. If one were to dream though, cloning the DUO but with the Super Grafx hardware and Arcade Card built in would be the coolest.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Sun Sep 04, 2011 8:02 am</p><hr />

The NES, on the other hand, was so popular everywhere that it's still really easy and cheap to find consoles (even if they are clones), carts (even if they are pirates) and accessories. I believe that's one of the greatest advantages about the NES when it comes to retro consoles.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Sep 03, 2011 6:20 pm</p><hr />

I guess... Many mappers already have extra RAM and PPU-based IRQ. Some have more VRAM for nametables. DMA is probably doable too (it would be pretty cool to be able to transfer 1000+ bytes to VRAM per VBlank!).<br /><br />Overclocking is the only feature in that list that would improve existing games, but it's also the only one that can't be put in a cart.

I've seen three kind of Famiclones in first half of 1990s. They are probably 'generations', steps of increasing integration.<br /><br />First kind is close to the original, with 2A03 clone, PPU clone (UMCs), SRAM chips, and some 74xx logic. Console had large two layers board with all these ICs and small one with 7805 and RF circuit.<br /><br />Second kind had an epoxy bulb kind large IC, but also two SRAM chips. The bulb sometimes was on a separate small board that was soldered with pins into main single layer board with cart slot, SRAMs and gamepad connectors. These clones had two boards too.<br /><br />Third kind is the NOAC, it had just an epoxy bulb IC, and almost no other components - quartz, few capacitors and resistors, rarely a transistor. These clones usually had three boards - one with gamepad connectors, other with cart slot and the chip (single layer), and third with 7805 and RF circuit.<br /><br />More modern clones were like third kind, but the board was ultra-small. Originally it was similar to Famicom cart by size, and modern boards were like 2-3 times smaller.<br /><br />None of these had the mixed duty cycles.<br /><br />Sound and picture quality-wise, first and second kind were better, third kind had a lot of digital noise in sound and often vertical bars of bright, don't know how this called properly (noticeable on black background as array of wide vertical columns).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Fri Sep 02, 2011 6:16 am</p><hr />

Older clones, which had individual chips for the CPU and PPU rather than a NOAC, are know to be much more accurate.
