DogP had them mapped out but has disappeared from this forum.<br />I BELIEVE NoCash would like to know as well to update his most excellent docs on the SNES  and varients.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I know the service manual doesn't tell you the cartridge slot pinouts.  Maybe you are thinking of the jamma (edge connector) pinout??   Trying to document the cartridge slots.<br />DogP determined that it was fully compatible for regular carts except for the CIC. <br />He was even in the process of making a converter so he could use regular carts.... Then he disappeared from the forums.   Has anyone heard from him??

But would be nice if somebody could verify them on a real NSS mainboard:<br /><ul>* A23-A15 are most likely on pins 33..41 (not pins 32..42)?<br />* Pins 20..48 seem to be arranged identically as on SNES cartridges (but without the CIC and supply pins)?<br />* Pin 5.A might be the slot select signal (if so, it should be different signal on each of the three slots)?<br />* Vpp is... what? Presumably not prom/eprom programming voltage... so what is it... why is it called Vpp?<br />* The &quot;CICn&quot; signals do refer to &quot;pin n&quot; of the 8pin Prom chip, is that correct?<br /></ul>EDIT: After checking some photos... above pinout is somehow mirrored... showing the pinout as when gazing at solder side of the mainboard.<br />EDIT2: After checking more photos... oops, above was just right... showing the pinput as when gazing at the component side of the mainboard.

It was quite some work to compile that list - would be glad if somebody could verify it! If it's right then you should see a 0 ohm connection between the cartridge pins and chip pins.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Cool. If some of the outer pins are arranged differently as on SNES, and pin 48.B is /RESET then it makes a lot more sense that Mark said that it connects to sram CE2.<br /><br />Also thanks for verifying that D4..D7 are ordered opposite as on SNES (I was thinking it might have been a typo, but now it's double checked).<br /><br />How are that two VCC's from SNES and INST-ROM wired on the Mainboard? Are they just short-cut with each other, or somehow decoupled via loops, or are they actually wired to different power sources? Or are they even wired to transistors or relays - allowing to power-down the cartridge's SNES chips for example?<br /><br />And when powered, they are both +5V, aren't they? At least the SNES should get 5V. And the INST-ROM EPROM also looks like 5V component on photos.

But I'll look into it when I map out the A side.
