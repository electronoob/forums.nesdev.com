<br />Awesome! That looks a bit like the prototype I was mocking up for an NES puzzlequest, but much cooler <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />Looks great so far. I probably don't have a lot of time to devote to playtesting, but I will be sure to play the contest release!

<br />Thanks!  I was worried about the graphics, as it's not my strong suit, but I was pretty happy with how they turned out.  It helps that a lot of things were cut due to time, so that cut down on graphics needed.
<br />
<br />Your prototype looks pretty nice.  Did you get to spells yet?  It looks like you were doing a more direct port of PuzzleQuest.  I tried to mix things up a bit, like having 6 types of mana.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Alright. um... I think it was on the Orc level, when it's computer's turn it makes the noise like a successful move was executed, when in fact nothing happened at all. On the Will O Wisp level, it sped up really fast for no reason at all. And, finally, on the Dragon level, I was never given a turn at all and died as a result. I don't know if any of those situations were intentional but they seemed weird so there you go. Also, as a personal opinion, it needs music (I made some if you want to use it lol), and I felt that it started out challening and only got easier and by like the sixth level it was a cinch and I almost didn't really have to pay too much attention or use too much strategy. But, all that having been said, I do sincerely think the game is awesome and addictive. Thanks for letting me test it!

I'll look at those issues you saw, tweak the difficulties, and maybe have a version with some character classes later today.
<br />
<br />Just out of curosity, which stats were you leveling up?

<br />Yeah the graphics look great, I'd suggest maybe loading an initial background before you start running the game engine if that's possible so you have a backdrop? I have a 4 color map optimizer I wrote in python if you'd like it, it outputs a CHR file and a map file in binary format for all tiles.
<br />
<br />Nah I only had the basic gameplay running in Python/Pygame. I really just wanted to see how hard the logic would be and if I could do it in the 6502 ASM cause I'm still pretty crappy at it.  Spells was next on my list, then life points. But I like the way you did it, not as much of a direct port <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />
<br />Also, I personally don't think it makes sense to have all of your power-ups when you have to start all the way over. That's probably what it was that was making it so easy to fly through it. I think you should either start over on the level you left off on with the same power-ups or start all the way over with no power-ups. It's kind of an easy way of cheating, actually, the way it's set up right now.

<br />
<br />Oh yeah, that was a bug.  Stats are supposed to go back to zero when you lose.  Fixed now.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I've got a new version.  Bugs fixed, monsters tweaked, and character classes!  Behold the mighty class selection screen!

<br />Do you mean having some graphics around the border of the gameboard?  The large black areas in the upper left and upper right were reserved for character/monster portraits, but I'm not going to time to do them now.  Besides those areas, there's not a whole of space to work with.  I don't want to make the screen too busy.  But maybe I can put something else where the portraits were going to go if I have time.

You'll see it doesn't have tje same finished feel. Plus its a pretty easy fix since you should only be writing that map data once. I also was playing with some graphics and even like a picture frame looking border grabs the eyes really well. Great job so far.

<br />
<br />Exactly! Compare these two pictures, and imagine even removing the border around the tetris box.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v249/cthulhu32/tetrisCompare.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Notice how much better the one on the right looks, even though ALL its doing is adding a background tile set. Even with just the single picture frame it looks better than if it was totally black.
