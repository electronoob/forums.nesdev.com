Heh... I've actually noticed that many of the famicom mappers I've worked on for my emu are just so superior to MMC3.

A second reason to avoid it is the fact that no Dragon Quest games use MMC3, they all uses MMC1, and they're still so good. Then Enix directly switched to MMC5 for Just Breed. Also, only Final Fantasy 3 uses MMC3, while the 1 and 2 uses MMC1, and are so good.

Hi guys,<br /><br />I've accepted the MMC3 as a sort of "standard" for my projects, as most of the games that interest me use it, wich means it can do a decent job.<br /><br />However, it's scanline counter is a pain in the butt, with all the limitations. Most of them I can live with. For example, the fact that you have to use specific pattern tables for sprites and BG is not that bad, since the mapper lets you choose the size of the banks for each side (you choose wich one uses 2KB chunks and wich one uses 1KB chunks).<br /><br />But there is one thing that I fear (wich I'm not even sure if it is one of the forbidden things), and it's the possibility that you can not use the other half of the pattern tables for sprites even when using 8x16 sprites. It makes sense that you can't, as you'd be using a table supposedly used for BG. Is that really breaking a MMC3 rule?<br /><br />I intended to have sprites using BG tiles, so that some BG stuff could be animated without the need to duplicate tiles and waste a lot of space, specially since I intended that most of them were animated, and bankswitching both copies would be a BIG waste of space.<br /><br />Maybe I should just set my priorities, and drop one of the two: scanline effects or cool animation...<br /><br />What do you think?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Dec 12, 2005 1:44 pm</p><hr />
