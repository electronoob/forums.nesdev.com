This is assuming by bit bang you basically mean that you treat the FTD as a glorified I/O port and do each bit on the host side.

Not sure what their how it's licensed but you could easily reproduce the schematic into your adapter.  Looking at thier site, it's obvious they have a hardspot for clones...  But since how it's a development kit I'd imagine they have some plan/tolerance for when you're ready to produce/market your finished product as something besides a teensy alone.

I'm not sure if you can directly connect to SPI via a virtual COM port the way you can with a U(S)ART.  Also, U(S)ART allows for true bi-directional communication, where SPI has to be driven by the master, though I'm not sure if that makes any difference in this configuration.  I just looked at the Teensy code package, and I think you might even be able to get it to build for the Atmega8U2, since the main difference between it and the Atmega32U4 found in the Teensy as far as this application is concerned is Flash memory space, and 8kb should be enough...

My basic requirements: the SNES side code is not using any kind of timed writes. I want to write one bit (for controllers) and one byte (for the expansion port.) I would like the controller fast enough to handle 40KB/s (320kbit/s) worth of data, and the expansion port to handle 2.68MB/s worth of data. Controller and expansion port chip do not have to be the same. I want it to be bidirectional. I want the PC side to be able to open /dev/ttyUSBx, and start using read/write to send and receive data. No third-party drivers, no proprietary USB driver code to be written by me, no extra kernel drivers to load. Plug and play.<br /><br />Cost really isn't an issue. Sure, I pay way more to have breadboard compatible stuff, but then I am mostly prototyping now anyway. Nobody's buying these things, so it's stupid to do a run of 100 PCBs, then decide I want to add something, and have to order more.<br /><br />If we got it all nice and finalized (honestly the controller port one mostly is), and there is demand from at least 10 people on buying one, then we can look into that. If you can MacGuyver your own out of two 74LS chips, bailing wire, and a pack of chewing gum, fantastic! Make your own <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> And preferably sell them to people so we can get more devices out there, heh.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, for your purposes, it sounds like a low-cost USB microcontroller is the way to go.  Then you can easily reconfigure it if you decide to go with the expansion port device.  From your speed requirements, I would guess that 16MHz would be sufficient (I think?).  If you're using a microcontroller that enumerates as a virtual COM port, I suppose it really doesn't matter what protocol you use out from there to communicate with the SNES (so ignore my previous comment about SPI not being able to do that...).  If you do move to an expansion port device, you'll have to write the SNES&lt;-&gt;uC communication code yourself, as I don't think there are any hardware-based 8-bit parallel interfaces in the AVR's, but it would be trivial to write the code to do it with GPIO's.  Any of the AtmegaXuX's should be sufficient for this task, or you could go with a PIC if you prefer (though I'm not familiar enough with them myself to be able to suggest one).<br /><br />Based on your initial design, I came up with this.  I know I need some more passive components, and probably need to connect some of the other various AVR pins to VCC or ground.  I haven't taken the time to look through the AVR datasheet, most likely I'll need some decoupling caps and some resistors on the USB lines.  Also, I'm not sure if you need an external crystal in this configuration since you're using an external clock line.  I decided to connect the output controller and ISL to the SNES 5V line so that they receive power regardless of whether or not the USB cable is plugged in.<br /><br /><a href="http://i45.tinypic.com/35lav06.png" class="postlink">http://i45.tinypic.com/35lav06.png</a>

That's actually fast enough to exceed USB &quot;full speed&quot; and require USB2 high speed instead. I'm not certain if there are any 8-bit microcontrollers that would be able to keep up with that, although something like the Atari 2600 Harmony cart definitely would. (Or an 8-bit micro could be used if it were ok to reduce the DMA chunk size to small enough and use handshaking such that each packet could be downloaded to the microcontroller's RAM before the SNES push/pulled data)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Getting the code to compile for the Teensy was fairly trivial (there was only 1 incompatibility vs. the Teensy++), but targeting the 16U2 is going to require a bit of hunting through datasheets.  In the meantime, I drew up a schematic (which I'll need to double and triple-check, especially for differences vs the 32U4, but I know it's at least close).  Here's the tentative board layout, sans traces.  I'm planning to use one of my spare controller ports off of one of the broken multitaps I have laying around, rather than using a cable for that end.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, as lidnariq mentioned, this design is limited to USB full-speed 12Mbit speeds.  Otherwise, it shouldn't be too incredibly difficult to make this work with the expansion port, you just won't hit your speed goal (though it should still be considerably faster than the controller port model).  I still haven't found anything in the datasheets to indicate that the Atmega16U2 has a dedicated 8-bit parallel interface, but it shouldn't be too hard to whip up a bit-bang protocol.  The Atmega16U2 has plenty of GPIO's, so that's not a problem.  We'll see how this goes, I'm still asking around on AVRFreaks to figure out the code changes for porting to the smaller uC.  Right now, I'm in the middle of a couple of projects, one of which is building non-volatile N64 controller paks (if anybody's interested in one, I'm selling them; shoot me a PM), plus I have school and work, so my focus is a bit split right now.

The -40 gives us 15+24 rows. The -50 gives us 20+29 rows.<br /><br />I'm fine with cutting the connector down to size if it can be done more reliably, eg with a table saw or something.<br />I am less fine with it being a surface mount connector. Getting that wired up to a breadboard for prototyping will be an absolute nightmare.<br />I'd much prefer a through hole design, preferably one that's amenable to an IDC cable being put on the end :/<br /><br />I don't know what the -K option is talking about. They also don't give you the critical measurements of the top of the connector's width and length. We need it to fit into the ~3.2cm x ~0.8cm slot on the SNES deck.<br /><br />Still, amazing that you found a 2mm card edge connector. Props there.
