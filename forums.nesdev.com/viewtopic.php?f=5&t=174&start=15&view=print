		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />$25 for a famiclone + NES adapter or does that also include a Squeedo?  Famiclones aren't very accurate, are they?  Even the newer ones such as the Neofami are supposedly crappier than emulators such as FCE Ultra.  I have a new in box AV Famicom, but I read some somewhere that the Famicom lacks certain sound channels or something that the NES includes.  So playing certain NES games on a Famicom will cause certain sounds to not be played.
<br />
<br />What would be wrong with using the Color Dreams voltage lockout-knockout trick?  It worked for them, right?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I meant $25 for just the Famiclone and adapter, but that's only speculation for now.  The $100 or so that tepples mentioned is pretty much in line with what I was thinking if a console could be included with Squeedo.
<br />
<br />I know the Famiclone I have now (Powerjoy II) has kinda poor quality sound.  It sounds like the duty cycles on the pulse channels are wrong or something.  Seems OK other than that.
<br />
<br />The info about (the real) Famicom having sound differences from the NES is a myth.  Apparantly there was an older revision of the CPU that didn't work with the RAW ($4011) sample method, but since there were games that use it I suspect it's not much of an issue.

<br />
<br />Generally yes, but not always.  I'd heard that some unlicensed games included a doc about how to disable the system's lockout chip, heh.  There's several revisions of the NES, and there's no method (that I know of) that works with all of them.  I'm just gonna use real lockout chips (from my own cart collection) so it won't be a concern.
