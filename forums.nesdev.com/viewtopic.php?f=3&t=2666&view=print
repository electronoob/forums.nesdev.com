<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">There are still some existing numbers left in the current iNES mapper space. (Around 30-40 or so by my last count).</div>
<br />
<br />Which means there's over 200 used mapper numbers.  After sorting my GoodNES set so that they're arranged by mapper number, I only have counted about 125. (Though I removed hacks and FFE stuff).
<br />
<br />Then I look at NEStopia's source -- it not only has support for mappers I can't even find ROMs for -- but it also has the name of the mapper that the number represents.
<br />
<br />Is there some kind of list somewhere that has this kind of info?  The most I've ever seen in one place is that everynes doc made by the nocash guy... but even that is missing several (and a bunch of the ones it has are wrong).  The info has to be out there though ---  where did Kevtris and Marty get this info from?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was looking at some of them.
<br />
<br />It looks like some mappers which are ambiguous are actually split between two (or more) mapper numbers.
<br />
<br />For example... mapper 90 is <em>without</em> the enhanced mirroring mode, and mapper 209 is the same mapper <em>with</em> it.
<br />
<br />And 19 has the sound+special mirroring, whereas some other 2xx is the same but without sound and special mirroring.
<br />
<br />
<br />Seems to be a lot of stuff like that -- which makes finding all of them REALLY tedious.  I just spent the past hour with the newst GoodNES to see if its header corrections were worth a damn (suprise, suprise, they weren't).  So I guess I'll either have to wait for Kevtris to finish and release that NES 2.0 set or go through all these ROMs by hand and try and figure out what goes where.
