Nintendo probably would have sued them anyway</div><br />Let's drop the &quot;and free&quot; for a moment: Did Nintendo back then have a policy against authorized developers offering packaged engines or other middleware to other authorized developers? I doubt it. I know nowadays, a Unity license comes with the standard devkit.<br /><br />It might be possible to tell whether middleware was used by comparing the binaries and compensating for anything that moved around, such as absolute or direct page addresses or parts that may have been ifdef'd out. In the past, I've <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=210788#p210788" class="postlink">suggested this</a> as a way of demonstrating to the public that a modern-era platformer with all original code is not a hack of a commercial-era beat-em-up.<br /><br />But it could also identify graphics engines that were adapted for use in a later game, such as <em>Spiritual Warfare</em> using a retooled version of the engine that Color Dreams had used for three prior <em>Boulder Dash</em> clones (I don't remember where I read this). And there are a couple known instances of cross-company middleware reuse during the classic era, such as <em>Action 52</em> using a music engine developed by Sculptured Software, as <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=7626" class="postlink">kevtris discovered in 2011</a>, which may have actually been licensed from Sculptured if Mario Gonzalez's recollection is anywhere near accurate. Likewise with Id licensing the engine of <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em> to Wisdom Tree.<br /><br />There are also code snippets allegedly from the example programs that Nintendo provided to licensed developers, such as the following <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=16721" class="postlink">useless code in many licensed games that runs after palette updates</a>:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda #$3F<br />sta $2006<br />lda #$00<br />sta $2006<br />sta $2006<br />sta $2006<br /></div><br />Also some mysterious MMC3 init code, which I can't dig up at the moment through search.<br /><br />It's been common throughout the modern era to reuse music engines, such as MUSE, FamiTone2, GGSound, and Pently. And with Shiru's neslib, cppchriscpp's nes-starter-kit, and NESmaker, modern-era NES middleware is set to take off.<br /><br />There is a tool called <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=14358" class="postlink">nsfid</a> to find shared audio drivers, but it takes manual definition of &quot;signatures&quot;, as with antivirus, to identify these drivers. Might there be a tractable way to identify shared code across games in general?

My understanding is that all they got were badly-translated versions of the 2A03 and 2C02 datasheets (which we have in their Japanese originals) as well as the MMC1 and MMC3 data sheets.<br /><br />Reused code snippets could also come from developers just disassembling the code from other games to learn from it, and in the case of obviously useless code, seems more likely to me.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think working out the blocks of code, then take the lowest address of the 'struct', then do deltas into the struct and compare based the code accessing Byte 7 of Something. Just taking the code and branches is probably not really going to be that useful, there are only so many ways to 'do a thing' on a machine as limited as the NES. you store meta tiles TL or Centre or BL and then have deltas, the delta code still looks the same. Minkowski collision and bounding box collision are going to be the same probably no matter who wrote it, there is the &quot;this is the way to do it in the smallest number of clocks&quot;, there will be some variance. I've not looked at NES games much, but on the SNES you can really tell which programmer did which by changes in style, so that might help. It would also have to be matched against people changing jobs, i.e this person wrote this game at this company then moved to this one and &quot;wrote&quot; the same code at the new one <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br />I would be really surprised if the Ocean Developer Kit didn't also have NES stuff in it, however the ODK seems to have vanished into the either with only memories of it. <br />The UK game dev scene seems to be very lax, with developers showing off their stuff to other developers and sharing code and tools. Reading the History of Japanese Game development, its seems in Japan if you spoke to somebody from another company in Japan that was considered Treason, and grounds for instant dismissal.

Reading the History of Japanese Game development, its seems in Japan if you spoke to somebody from another company in Japan that was considered Treason, and grounds for instant dismissal.</div><br />In relatively recent years I've seen some rather severe non-disclosure and non-compete clauses from major game companies in North America, and I've seen much more relaxed ones. Aside from the NDA stuff, a lot of them additionally specify that you're not allowed to participate in any game development activities (may also extend to related media like film/animation), even non-professional ones, outside of work (and if you do, they're automatically owned by them). The biggest predictor of severity seems to be the size of the parent company.

It's also kind of hard to share just a bit of C++, you usually need the whole thing or nothing at all. By the time you port the vector systems, code style, label names etc is it still the same code <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> Where as dropping in a bit of 6502 to do 'a thing' is a lot easier. <br /><br />Back in the 80s, yes the companies still had the share code and die attitude, but well people got drunk in pubs a lot and even though they technically worked for different companies stuff got shared. I think the UK being so small helps. Basically the UK game scene is 2 degrees from anybody.
