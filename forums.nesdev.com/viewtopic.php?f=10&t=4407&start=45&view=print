<br />
<br />If you're looking for the graphical data in the game, there you go; you have it. If you can effectively plug them into MM2's level editor, I'm pretty sure you'll be able to make levels for MM9. Though I don't know how MM2's levels are in comparison to those of MM9. If they're really similar, than you should be able to build decent levels for MM9.

<br />
<br />But you are right about one thing; all the graphics can't possibly be there. First of all, it's labled as a .NES file, but it's not a NES file, it's a graphics file. Open it with YY-CHR or some Tile Editor to view the graphics. I don't see Megaman's graphics there, or really any enemies. I see Dr. Wily on the top, and then the words "Mega Man" below that. There's some level tile data, but no sprites I don't think. Also, there are big dark spaces between the level graphics.
<br />
<br />Also, you should probably know what you're doing a little more before you attempt to remake MM9 on the NES. This is kind of a big project... You should learn 6502 and whatnot.

<br />
<br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not lazy and would TOTALLY do this if I knew how. But before I learn something like 6502, I want to see if someone who already knows it is willing to undertake this. Learning 6502 AND porting MM9 to NES all by myself would take years.

A port wouldn't really have to take years. I think if I were -really- committed to my project, working on it every day, I could really progress a lot. But sometimes the crap work seems too crappy and I don't want to do it, so I just do something else.
<br />
<br />I really recommend learning how to program for the NES though. While figuring this MM9 stuff out, you could at the same time be educating yourself to program for the NES, so if it turns out that no one here will do the work, you'll have a better shot at doing it yourself. Also, this is a very helpful community, so it's really unlikely you'll be hopelessly stuck. And plus, it's fun to have that knowledge, knowing that you could do lots of stuff with it.

<br />The thing is that if there was such a person, he would probably have had the idea already (maybe he's even working on it as we speak without teling anyone?), and probably wouldn't need your help for anything. I guess (hobbyist) programmers don't like to work on implementing other people's ideas.

You don't normally make a Megaman game for practice, especially one that would be a challenge to fit and implement.  You don't do it to tweak the system to your liking, you do it to make an exact replica.  And the end result is to release something for free that a company is trying to make money on, which isn't usually a good idea.  You might as well save time and do it in GameMaker.
<br />
<br />Personally, I wouldn't recreate MM9 because I want to make my own games.  That, and I was never a huge Megaman fan either. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />
<br />I don't think anyone here is really seeing the ramifications of this project. Having this game on an NES cartridge would be life-altering for thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people. For example, Capcom released a press release kit for MM9. It was an actual NES cartridge, but they had hollowed it out and simply put in a mini-CD with screenshots from the game. Basically, it just LOOKED like would-be nes cartridge but had no game and was completely unplayable. The press release kit was selling for $1200 on eBay, making it one of the most sought-after promotional items in videogame history. $1200 for a hollow nes cartridge with just the MM9 sticker on the front! Fans thought that sticker was worth the price of what a lot of people pay for a new HDTV. (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.capcomdigital.com/blog/2008/09/16/mega_man_9_retail_package">http://www.capcomdigital.com/blog/2008/ ... il_package</a><!-- m -->)
<br />
<br />In saying this, I'm not trying to advertise how much money would be made off an actuall NES cartridge. Obviously that is illegal to sell it and that is not my goal from the project. I only say this so anyone who thought they would receive no recognition beyond a "hey good job" pat on the back from this forum, you are wrong. Making an nes cartridge of this game would basically make you the god of all mega man fans worldwide. The entire online retro gaming community would be going nuts.
<br />
<br />Also, for those who argue this will hurt MM9 sales, you are right. If a rom is released of the game, many will opt out of buying the game since the rom would be free. My argument against this is as follows:
<br />
<br />1. The hysteria for MM9 is over. It's been out for almost a year now and I'm sure sales are slow.
<br />2. I can't imagine Capcom would be at all upset about this. They actually REALLY wanted to make a cartridge of the game (see the link I posted above), but publicly they couldn't do it because of all the legal hoops they would have to jump through as a company to actually sell that cartridge in stores. I'm sure the producers of the game would shed a tear or two of joy if one of their fans made the cartridge, since the entire premise of the game was designed with the NES in mind every step of the way.
<br />
<br />As far as current progress on this project, I found a guy who is currently working on this. I'm sure it's a lot of work though and he would love some help. If you want to help out, his email is dlm92887 at yahoo dot com. Basically what the plan is is to extract the graphics from the wii .wad file, and then reprogram a very similar rom like MM2 or 3, and then flash it on an NES cartridge.
<br />
<br />If anyone is interesting in helping, I'm sure we could put a portmm9 website together and starting dividing responsibilities.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I've said enough.
