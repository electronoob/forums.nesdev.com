		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some days ago I just got these YM2413 clones which are the UM3567, and tried to interface it with a microcontroller with no luck, which is no sound at all. Even double checked the basic connection schematics for the YM2413. As the UM3567 has 24-pins, I have to refer to the <a href="http://www.msxpro.com/fm.html" class="postlink">http://www.msxpro.com/fm.html</a> for the pinouts.<br /><br />I even tried to connect the output (right now testing only the Melody-Out) to an op-amp buffer, and an LM386 amp, and got no sound.<br /><br />Any ideas on how to interface the YM2413 and/or its clones? I have tried the other clone chips such as KC89C72 (which is the clone of GI's AY-3-8910) and it's much easier to get an output compared to the YM2413.<br /><br />Thanks.

Yeah, I actually did let a long delay (more than 100 microseconds) for each data transfer. I'll try rewiring these again as I'm doing it on a breadboard and a PIC microcontroller. The UM3567 has a different pinouts, but I assume most of the registers on the thing is the same as the one in the YM2413. In other story, the KC89C72 (clone of AY-3-8910) has a slight difference in the registers compared to the original one by GI/Microchip.<br /><br />I know this is a funny attempt since one can just make an FM synthesizer using dsPIC w/ DAC (I actually did for a contest, but using a PIC32) but I'm kinda curious on how does the &quot;retro&quot; meets the modern. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was trying to reply hours ago, but my connection was a bit wonky, so didn't get to send this until now.<br /><br />Finally, I got the thing to work. At first I dumped random values, and there I hear noises. So I confirmed these chips are working on my hand. So, one by one, I tested each register to see whether the UM3567 is different compared to the YM2413. Results, it is almost the same, that UM3567 is 24-pins and has a different pinout.<br /><br />Up to the level that I managed to coax the thing to play a note or two on it, using the pre-set instrument values. It worked but I don't hear anything after I put a value more than 0x04 or 0x05 in the &quot;volume section&quot; in the addresses 0x30~0x38. I had to put it to 0 and that is the loudest. On the datasheet, putting the &quot;f&quot; into that nibble means maximum volume. Either the engineers there might have intentionally flipped the values, or it is a defective one. I have to try the other chips to confirm this one.<br /><br />The strobes and the delays are more than the required one in the datasheet, so it's still OK.<br /><br />I'll update the post should I find something interesting about that chip.

Hmm, I found it strange that in the <a href="http://www.smspower.org/maxim/Documents/YM2413ApplicationManual" class="postlink">application manual</a> it means only &quot;Volume&quot;. Some examples like that  <a href="http://htlab.net/products/electronics/ym2413-shield-1/" class="postlink">YM2413 shield for Arduino (custom made)</a> uses &quot;F&quot; as the maximum volume.<br /><br />On other news, the sound coming out from the clone is a bit too soft. I'm connecting this to a TDA7052 without much improvements as well. Could it be the output impedance problem?

I don't have any personal experience with it so I cannot really comment. Real YM2413 is quiet and you do need some amping stage. The output is muxed (channels one after other) which produces a ton of really high freq components in the signal (up to and beyond 1MHz) so you need to experiment with some filtering or the opamp is gonna have hell of a hard time doing proper output.<br /><br />You can see my output stage for the YM2413 here :<br /><a href="http://www.tmeeco.eu/Fileden/YM2413SCHEM.jpg" class="postlink">Wide picture</a>

You have been extremely helpful. I got a decent volume out of the TDA7052 right now because I forgot to put the 5K resistor between the inputs in the amplifier. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Prior to that, I passed the thing to a first order LPF, which cuts off on at least 54kHz. The sampling frequency in the datasheet was around 50kHz. Haven't experimented with multi-orders as I had lost touch on those things since many years ago. Had to read up on it and to speak to my colleague (he's an expert in this) for opinions.
