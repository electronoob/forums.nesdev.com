<br />
<br />
<br /> 1. Are there any games that have 2 DIP chips that aren't custom? If so what are they? I know Krazy Kreatures does, so I assume nearly all AVE boards do?
<br />
<br />
<br /> 2. Where can I get a Windows .NES to 2 .BIN files seperator program?
<br />
<br />
<br /> Okay thanks, I just really want a reason to make a hole in a NES cart or two for prototyping XD <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

Any game on the UNROM, UOROM, CPROM, or ANROM board has two 7400 series ICs: a 74HC161 to hold the bank number and some logic gate to help in decoding. So does Crazy Climber, which uses a variant of the UNROM setup.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">2. Where can I get a Windows .NES to 2 .BIN files seperator program?</div>
<br />Does this iNES splitter have to be .exe, or can it be .py (Python program)?

<br />
<br />Once you have it, put your ROM in the same folder as Ucon, and go to command prompt and type in: UCON64 -s (insert ROM name here).
<br />
<br />i.e. UCON64 -s Bomberman.nes
<br />
<br />I have had a problem with games with spaces in the names like Super Mario Bros.nes so it may be an idea to remove any spaces from the name before hand.
<br />
<br />I'm assuming you're using Windows, so I would go with the MingW: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ucon64/files/ucon64/ucon64-2.0.0/ucon64-2.0.0-win32-mingw-bin.zip/download">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ucon64/ ... p/download</a><!-- m -->

For Famicom carts I don't know though. You can assume Nintendo boards probably rewired it. I've heard from a friend that Konami VRC boards rewired it.

<br />
<br />When Bregalad said that non-Nintendo made carts have standard pinouts I think he meant unlicensed carts. Konami carts use the Nintendo pinouts.

Most NES carts I've found here in Brazil are from the US anyway (the original console was officially represented too late in it's like), and I've seen like, 3 SMB+DH carts that used glop tops, versus 0 that used DIP chips. But if you think you have better chances in the US, go for it, personally I wouldn't risk buying this particular cart.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And the converter gyromite uses a glop, too....</div>
<br />I also bought a couple of Gyromite carts looking for this converter, with no luck.

<br />
<br />
<br /> And for the converter, You can either check to see if the pins are different, or have another early cart that only has a Prg, Chr and Lockout chip and feel the difference in weight, I felt 5 carts and picked one out that felt heavier and it had the converter to yeah, It's okay, If it used a single ROM though, that would help a bunch for prototyping since I would only have to swap one out every time....But I guess if I have all the characters there andway I'd only use one so whatever....
<br />
<br />
<br />Yeah and about the Camerica games, all their rom's have a word on them here, it's starts with a C and basicly has no difference so they might have Masked rom's too....
