		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for your response!<br /><br />I can go on eBay and find extra power switch boards for around $10 but this seems expensive. It's usually cheaper to buy individual components. The actual switch could be had for around $2-3 dollars from stores like Mouser or DigiKey, judging by current prices for similar models.<br /><br />What I'm trying to achieve is being able to restore a front loader using modern replacement components wherever possible. I know I'm not going to be able to source everything, but I want to try. I don't like wasting original hardware if I can help it. Swapping out a whole board for one switch feels wasteful to me.<br /><br />If no one has been able to source a replacement, then it could be that replacement switches simply aren't manufactured any more. I thought I would ask since there are many NES hardware gurus here.<br /><br />Thanks again. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So after searching Newark and Chip1Stop (a Japanese component supplier) with no success, I decided on an experiment in disassembly of the power and reset switches. I had a switch board from an NES that had noticeable salt corrosion and the power and reset switches had no continuity when closed.<br /><br />There are very thin tabs on these switches that can be unlatched with some gentle coercion, yielding access to the switch contacts.<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

			<span class="gensmall">Switches_Highlighted.jpg [ 871.91 KiB | Viewed 2009 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div><br /><br />After desoldering the switches, I used a small screwdriver to gently pry latches free. Once the contacts were exposed, I used a little Brasso on a cotton swab and cleaned the contacts to a shine. They were quite nasty but the build-up came off easily with the Brasso. I used 91% alcohol in a spray bottle to rinse the contacts and switches clean.<br /><br /><span style="color: #BF0000">Caution: </span>Make sure you remove the buttons from the switch before spraying with alcohol. ISO will make the ink/paint used for the lettering run... don't ask how I know.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> <br /><br />I reassembled the switches and checked continuity on each switch. I was getting clean and consistent beeps when closed. I soldered the switches back in place, connected the harness to my main NES, and it fired up. <br /><br />I know this is not revolutionary, but it's nice to know that you can resurrect these switches in a pinch. <img src="./images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" />

I will use an original if it's on hand and order where necessary. It's just that there is an ever-dwindling supply and it's interesting to see what's out there. It doesn't hurt to have knowledge on a switch with functional specs.

One thing I verified - the hot glue on top is a jumper i created for the switch to function properly. I could make it cleaner by running it underneath.  If you're still interested, I can stop by the parts shop in the morning and pick up a few to get more info.....

I found these a few years ago when I had a bad/corroded power switch and didn't want to buy the whole assembly online.  The hardest part seems to be finding a switch that has pins that line-up with the solder holes on the PCB.  My PCB can work side by side, or in a straight line.  Most switches have the pins too far apart, but the 2 inner pins on this switch fit perfect.<br /><br />Yes, they are new old stock.  I believe if you remove the little metal pin on top, it becomes a momentary switch and can be used as a reset button.
