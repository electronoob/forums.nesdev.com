Does anyone know if NESASM 3, MagicKit, or other DOS-prompty-looking NESDev things will run on a Mac? Or would it be best to keep my old laptop as a NESDev workstation? I guess I could ask Google, but I'm lazy, and I figure that someone here will know.

<br />
<br />I suppose I don't know too much about Macs. I just think that if you're going to be doing stuff with homebrew programs, Windows is standard, so a lot of them may only be compatible with Windows.

<br />I agree; several tools are probably only available as Windows executables, no source code (and not portable even if there were), so running Windows is a good idea. But, you don't have to use it as your main OS, just run it in a virtual machine, almost as another program. <a href="http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop/screens&amp;demos/" class="postlink">Parallels</a> is one that integrates Windows programs at the window level.

<br />
<br />Heh, I tried out a Mac 10 years ago. Actually, most of open-source programs aren't specific for Windows, but fully portable. About the web, I had some problems while using Linux, like websites don't playing a music because they were "unable to find Windows Media". <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

I don't know why, while I'm no expert in PC nor macs, and while I've never used a mac in all it's potential, I feel like the extra price of Macs is just a waste for the consummer that can do exactly the same with a PC but by paying less. So use a mac if you want to look cool, fashionable and loose money stupidly and else use a PC.

<br />
<br />In reality I consider all current OS'es bloated and resources wasting but unfortunately  there is no real alternative with the kind of support windows has.
<br />
<br />Windows is the best because its what most people use. This results in more software being developed for it and more hardware to run in it. So the most practical choice is XP at the moment
