		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />By &quot;4 sprites&quot;, were you referring to four 8x8, 8x16, 16x16, 16x32, 32x32, etc. portions of the same cel, or were you referring to four independent cels? If four independent cels, then all four would need to be rotated by the same angle, and I fail to understand exactly how this would prove useful. If four portions of the same cel, you'd need to somehow combine them into one cel after you have finished rotating them so that you don't have a bunch of blank space at each side that decreases usable overdraw. If you do not understand how rotating four cels would result in a bunch of blank space at each side that decreases usable overdraw, do you need me to make you a diagram?

If you did want to rotate all 4 by he same angle at once, I would think that's an advantage too, albeit a very situational one.<br /><br />For instance, if you were doing a Sonic the Hedgehog rotating bonus round as sprites, you could rotate a set of 4 different tiles all at once.
