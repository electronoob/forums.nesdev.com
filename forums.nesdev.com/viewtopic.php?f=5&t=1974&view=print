<br />Once upon a time, a buddy gave me his Advance Wars 2 cart, because he suspected it of being a pirate, and he wanted a real version.  It's not very hard to determine the legitimacy of it, considering the back says <strong>Nintondo</strong>.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.fybertech.com/images/nintondo.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />But upon opening it, it's clearly cheaply made, using big'ol epoxy splotches to cover the roms instead of using actual chips.  It also uses an actual battery with some sram, instead of a nice piece of flash memory.  I opened up my genuine Zero Mission cart so you can get a good idea of the difference in quality:

<br />
<br />This company has probably taken Nintendo for hundreds of thousands of dollars selling these bootlegs, possibly millions depending on how many different carts they produce, so it's really no wonder companies like Nintendo go to so much trouble to add region checks and all that sort of stuff, in at least some small attempt at preventing everybody and their brother from producing pirated versions.

It's what Nintendo itself used in the really-mass-produced SMB/Duck Hunt cartridges, because it was less expensive. And battery-backed static RAM is more reliable than flash memory in terms of rewriting, though less-reliable in terms of accidental erasure and long-term retention in the face of a discharging battery. The big thing that stands out for me is the lack of gold plating on the connector edge, which increases connection resistance and oxidation rate.

It just "looks" cheaper.  And many times, unless the result of a mass-production run of a really popular game as mentioned, it would tend indicate a pirate version of something, based on what I've seen.  What's funny about this cart that I forgot to mention is that they didn't even take off the logo screen somebody added onto the rom; it's the same rom I tried before I ever got the cart.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Though <a href="http://releases.pocketheaven.com/?system=gba&amp;section=release&amp;rel=1060" class="postlink">Advance Wars 2</a> uses flash memory, <a href="http://releases.pocketheaven.com/asearch/?Name=&amp;Release=&amp;Publisher=&amp;Country=&amp;Language=&amp;Dumper=&amp;Filename=&amp;Internal=&amp;Serial=&amp;CRC32=&amp;Size=&amp;Save=%25SRAM%25&amp;Sort=Name&amp;=Search" class="postlink">all these games</a> have SRAM instead of flash.

<br />
<br />I tried to find another cart with storage in it to see what it looked like when I was taking the pictures, but that's all that was laying around.  I tried Pitfall first, and it was even more bare than those two, using just a single chip for the rom.  I just assumed they "evolved" to using flash memory to avoid batteries burning out.
<br />
<br />That's an interesting page there on Nintendo's site showing off the pirate versions though, I wouldn't have expected them to actually show the guts of the carts.  I don't believe I've ever seen inside a Tengen cart, either, so that could be interesting as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wow ! I didn't exept pirates doing counterfaits SO well. Most have the exact same label, or a few details changed that doesn't look wrong. Of course the "seal of quality" is here on all pirate copies. Without open the cartridge it seems almost impossible to tell the pirate one. Only the "GameBoy advance" logo seems a little wrong on pirate carts, but I'm unsure.
<br />
<br />Surprisingly, all pirate carts exposed were american. I'd think pirates did only care to counterfait japanese stuff.
<br />Where are the pirate version for sale (no, it is not to buy them, it is for curiousity) ? Where was they producted (usually this is from Hong-Kong, but why would they bother with american games) ? Did they come with faked boxes as well ? Is it possible to buy them without even suspect they are pirated ?
<br />
<br />Also, all GBA games I have use SRAM, exept for Golden Sun - The lost age. I understand now why Golden Sun takes much longer than other games to save the game.
<br />
<br />EDIT : About the GBA database with search engine, a such database MUST be done to the NES.

<br />I've assumed this is the reason for using battery RAM on some games instead of flash, because there are frequent updates to saved data (F-Zero X for N64 has battery RAM, since I think the game updates stats every race). Another nice benefit of using battery RAM is that any spare space can be used as extra work memory (or you could even use a larger RAM). I think Yoshi's Island for SNES did this.
