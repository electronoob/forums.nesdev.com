The animation has a couple issues but I won't have the time to get to them until tonight.<br /><br />The most obvious thing is that I made the tank much smaller. This is primarily so that the tank could become a sprite object to fall into the pit if necessary. I'm curious what you guys think of the size. Is it still intimidating at this size?<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

	</div><br /><br />There are a lot of technical considerations to doing this scene, so I'm going to try to balance the best of all of the options. If the tank never had to fall into the pit, then it would be a lot easier and it would never have to be small. If the tank just say, blew up, that would be easier, but I feel less dramatic. Not to mention that the proposition of attacking a tank with a sword does not seem like a particularly fruitful one. One of the things that I want to do for the scene is to have it so that when you battle the flying machine, the terrain has changed depending on how much of the bridge you had to let get taken out in the fight with the tank. So it could be easier with more of the bridge or tougher if you have to jump over big gaps while fighting. I think I'll make at least a rough storyboard of this tonight to show what I have in mind.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">As long as you have 64 or less horizontal pixels worth of floor remaining, you can fake it using sprites and have the background tank fall.</div><br />If I'm not mistaken, moving the tank downward while in background would also require moving downward basically all background tiles since I can't do a vertical split scroll, right? I think I need to storyboard it like I was saying so I can rectify my understanding of what's possible.<br /><br />Espozo, I want to say that I really like the treads you drew. I don't know honestly if they're exactly right for this game but they're really cool. If I don't end up using them you should find somewhere to use them. I have a feeling you'll be good with mechanical sprite drawing. A benefit with the treads you drew is that they'll animate smoothly without many frames of animation. With the way mine is, and the treads spaced out so far, it takes a lot of frames to cycle. Having a shorter cycle for the animation would be beneficial.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I guess you want more of a &quot;WWI style&quot; tank?</div><br />Exactly. but any number of liberties to make it fit better in a game or otherwise are fine, as long as they fit with the aesthetic. I guess what I'm saying is that historical accuracy is in no way a concern as it is a work of fantasy.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I honestly thought is was a joke at first. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> It's like a heavily armored forklift.</div><br />It's pretty ridiculous. A little more like a Bobcat than a forklift. I like the Ripsaw &quot;Luxury Super Tank&quot; <a href="http://www.ripsawtank.com/" class="postlink">http://www.ripsawtank.com/</a><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Fjamesfernandez wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I think I could had detail the crap out of it with the right reference but yeah</div><br />To be honest what I had in mind was the tank from Nausicaa and I wanted to make it at least a little different from that, but didn't have any super clear ideas for what would be different. The best image of the Nausicaa tank I could find is a 3D rendering: <img src="http://orig09.deviantart.net/7ffd/f/2009/018/2/c/akuyaku_no__1_tank_render_by_negathus.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The things I put at the bottom are supposed to be extra guns so that the tank will have other ways to shoot, but they look kind of silly. When I get back to working on this I'm going to adapt the changes you made. It improves the shape of it quite a bit.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Throwing my two cents in, I think you could still make an intimidating-looking tank while still having it be very small sprite-wise.<br /><br />In Blaster Master, didn't they have separate perspectives for the tank segments and on-foot segments? While you were in the tank, your character's sprite was only a few pixels tall compared to the tank. But on-foot, the character's size was much larger. This preserved the sense of scale while easing up on the number of tiles the tank needed. So my suggestion would be to have a very realistically-proportioned tank and shrink the size of the character sprite for those segments. And that flying machine? Make it a huge background object like Mecha Dragon from Mega Man 2.

You could throw some details in the middle, always minding the sprite limit, and have the top part fully detailed, since it's narrower.

		<br />
	</div><br />One concern I have is how I'll handle the animation if the tank ends up on one of the columns after destroying a bridge. Sure, the tank could still fall because it's not wide enough, but I'm not sure how to handle that without having an animation of the tank falling in at an angle. That doesn't seem particularly feasible.<br />To eliminate animating the tank falling into the pit would make a lot of things easier. I'd never have to consider making the tank a sprite object. I could make it as big as I want, and have a lot less concerns with the technical issues. However, I just can't picture this in a way that looks right. I can cut corners for something this large but I don't want the player to ultimately be confused as to what just happened.<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<br />
	</div><br />Doing this scene is probably a little easier than the last. The next hurdle is to have the top part of the playfield scroll in two directions to move the plane, kind of like the helicopter boss in Super C. This one wouldn't ever pass over the bridge, so it wouldn't have the same concerns about the scrolling. I'd like to have some animated fire at the bottom during this scene. Since there won't be too many tiles used on the bridges, I think I'd still have CHR space for this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The problem with having a sprite tank is that even if you make it only 64 pixels wide, there's still the girl, the sword, the hit effects... the tank will still flicker a lot.<br /><br />There's one way you can have both the tank and the bridges as backgrounds: While the tank is moving left and right, you can normally rewrite the horizontal scroll mid-screen, but right before it's about to fall, you have to redraw it at the correct position relative to the bridge. Then you can scroll the whole screen vertically to make it fall, but switch the bridge/pillar tiles to vertically rotated versions that cancel the scroll, so they appear to be stationary. You'll have to redraw the top and bottom of the bridge every time a rotation cycle finishes. That's a whole lot of trouble for such a quick effect, though.<br /><br />As for tilting the tank in case it's over one of the columns, that can be done if the tank is drawn with sprites, as long as the angle isn't too steep. You can achieve believable enough rotation on the NES if you arrange the sprites like this:<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
