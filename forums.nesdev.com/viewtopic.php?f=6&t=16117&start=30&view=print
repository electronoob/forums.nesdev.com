Just pay careful attention and you'll notice it.</div><br />Ah, I suppose it does! Of course there are parts where it drops out entirely when there's too much going on, but there are also parts where it's playing while text is being added to the screen and minor changes to the graphics are occurring. But it does have to alternate these tasks, and you see small pauses that delay the text being added to the screen. I thought at first the actions were woven together, but they are full-blown pauses that just happen to be pretty short (because drum samples aren't very long of course). I guess it deserves an honorable mention for trying to &quot;get away with it&quot;.  <img src="./images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Memblers wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Add Karate Champ to the list.

Do you have any videos/ audio of the device in action?<br /><br />Super Russian Roulette is coming out very soon (now-ish?), which also hijacks the $4011, being fed PCM from another source (to be able to have lots of it).

Do you have any videos/ audio of the device in action?<br /></div><br /><br />I have some pictures, and audio recordings, but the recordings are very poor quality since at the time I was worried about using a bunch of bandwidth if I uploaded large files and stuff.<br /><a href="http://membler-industries.com/squeedo/2004_version/" class="postlink">http://membler-industries.com/squeedo/2004_version/</a> in /samps/, 007.mp3 and 008.mp3 are it playing MML files.  But it plays the wrong notes and goes out of tune and stuff, as it turns out there was a pre-existing bug in the version of MCK I was modifying for testing.  This drove me nuts at the time since I couldn't find the problem anywhere in my own code!  The synth ran on a PIC18F MCU, and it did 4 channels of audio mixed at 32khz.  It was mostly wavetable synthesis, 256 8-bit samples with 8-bit volume control.  But there was also a noise generator.<br /><br />If you look in the directory above that link, you can see the redesigned version I started around 2009 or so.  But that version has never been built onto an NES cart, unfortunately.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Super Russian Roulette is coming out very soon (now-ish?), which also hijacks the $4011, being fed PCM from another source (to be able to have lots of it).</div><br />Yeah it's pretty cool, I don't know what hardware is on there exactly, but if it's like A Winner Is You, I mostly consider it a memory expansion since there's no DSP action involved.  Though that could be considered a pedantic point, hehe.  Pretty soon I'll be trying an experiment with an on-cart MP3 player for a certain project, that too could hold a lot of audio.<br /><br />BTW I'm really enjoying the Retro Game Audio podcast now.  Was especially cool to hear that interview with Dave Warhol.
