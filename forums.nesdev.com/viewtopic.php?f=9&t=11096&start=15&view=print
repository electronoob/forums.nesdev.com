Because what the Mapper IC does mostly is expand the number of address lines available.  It's not really that confusing. It even works exactly the same on a Famicom, a MSX or SEGA Master System/MARK-III...  It's just that the Famicom has two parallel mappers operating at the same time in two independent buses. <br /><br />I would say stick to official naming to reduce the confusion the maximum possible. <br />I was the other day homebrewing hardware for the Master System and had a hard time with the ASIC generated bus signals naming adopted by the folks at SMS Power while using a SEGA official schematic as pinout reference. <br /><br />Extremely annoying experience....<br /><br />So far the NESDEV wiki has done great at avoiding that stuff so let's not duplicate that here, please.

It's seen by the CPU, which is the element actively reading it. The way the ROM is connected to the bus affect the granularity of the pages or their ordering and that's sensible to the way the software executes, not to the ROM layout (as it's &quot;seen by itself). Including that's a known trick to make software dumping more annoying (have the address lines shuffled so when a chip is read &quot;correctly&quot; with a chip programmer the code is shuffled in the reverse way...  Only way to read it properly is analyze how the ROM is hooked to the CPU and duplicate that or use that to de-shuffle the dumped data...)  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">How much of this renaming habit comes from A. the community establishing names without access to official documents, or B. wishing to avoid admitting having been tainted by trade-secret or otherwise illegally copied documents?</div><br /><br />That never been a concern for people dealing with SEGA systems. I know Nintendo used to be &quot;ANAL&quot; about their designs back in the day due to the (then justified) concern about how much such knowledge would aid counterfeiters but fear that they will prosecute at this point down the road is a perfect example of a moot point. They won't pursue a subject if the object is not either a possible direct menace to any of their businesses nor is a possible way for them to achieve direct instant profit.<br /><br />Lovely discussion. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
