		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just wanted to check something before I start investigating the reason I'm getting the odd bit of CHR corruption. I'm pretty sure it's because I'm sometimes doing too much writing of VRAM in a single frame but weirdly it never occurs in Nestopia, only on actual hardware (Famicom AV + PowerPak).
<br />
<br />It manifests itself by corrupting a few CHR tiles. Reducing the amount of writes to $2006/$2007 during vblank stops it from happening but I want to be sure that it's simply a case of me writing too much or there's something else going on too, a possible side effect maybe.
<br />
<br />I'm just confused how the CHR ROM appears to get corrupted which would seem to suggest it's peculiar to PowerPak somehow? That may very well be a pretty dumb thing to suggest, I don't know much about hardware intricacies.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sounds less like "CHR ROM corruption" and more like the PPU doing something "unexpected" as a result of doing too much in a single frame (single NMI/interrupt).  You might have to resort to cycle counting to see how much time your NMI routine takes up...

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The strange thing is, it's not constantly corrupting stuff, it just seems to affect a couple-or-three characters on screen (but the actual CHR definitions for them so, say, all the letter "C"s will have a line through the middle for example). Resetting the NES doesn't seem to cure it either - I have to switch it off and back on again.
<br />
<br />The other problem is that I can't replicate it in Nestopia so it's not something that is easily traceable. Yes, I can force my screen updating routines to do too much and that will be visible in Nestopia but the glitch manifests itself differently so I don't even know if it's the same problem on hardware Vs Nestopia.

Re-insert your cart in the NES and reset until it gets cured (it usually takes a LOT of tries to get proper image, and sometimes even corrupt while playing - which is why I mostly play NES games emulated).

<br />
<br />Yeah could be a bad cart connection too, but that's less likely on a Famicom and easy to rule out.

<br />Couldn't the fact that the PowerPak has to go through an adapter in order to work on a Famicom make things worse?
<br />
<br />I know I very often get corrupt tiles with the PowerPak on my NES. It usually takes a few tries to get it working right.

<br />
<br />If the adapter works, it shouldn't.  At least in my experience with a Game Genie, my friends and I used one all the time because it made the games work better.  But that was a bad connector issue.  But if the PowerPak has some kind of bus control issue, I have no idea.  I heard it doesn't work on some Famiclones, and no one knows why.

<br />
<br />I've optimised my two big buffer updating routines as combined they were taking up about 7/8ths of the screen! I'll do some more testing.
