<br />
<br />And I think why some of us particularly don't like some of the recent posts is when a specific game is named and then the question asked, how do I bootleg it? It's blatantly asking for help bootlegging. Not even a half-assed attempt at hiding it.

Importing games can be difficult and expensive, so you can't blame someone for trying other ways of playing a game that isn't available in their area. I mean, when there isn't a legal alternative, it's not easy to define what's illegal...
<br />
<br />This guy's attitude is annoying though. It's not like we're hiding knowledge or anything (we don't do that here) it's just that there simply isn't a non-japanese game that can be used as donor. We can't make stuff up.

<br /> please don't take it for  provocation because it have  no means the case I understood well that only original is functional because the mapper is specific and is necessary to hacker the rom to turn it compatible with another mapper or buy a famicom and the original game

A famicom is more or less between 1000/3000 yen depending where you get it.  Crisis force can sometime be found loose for 700 yen but usually will go between 1200/2000 yen. those are the usual street price in japan.
<br />
<br />You may be right that many game didn't game out it Europe and Bregalad can confirm it but that game didn't came out in the US too so in that case you cannot use that as a defense.
<br />
<br />From the way you write and the word you use (svp) and location you mentioned, you seems to be french native but I could be wrong.  If this is the case, be careful the way you write your comment since they may be provocative and you may not be aware of it. Maybe it was not your intention too so just be careful on how you phrase them.
<br />

<br />Il y a aussi des gens qui parlent en francais sur ce forum alors si tu n'est pas certain, tu peux toujours le demander en francais dans le forum international. Fait juste attention de la facon que tu ecris parce que certaine phrases qui on ete ecritent precamment avaient un ton provocant.

<br />This is true, but has nothing to do with the original topic.
<br />We were just saying that no non-japanese donor card can do what you wanted, and on a side note I just got annoyed by the amount of thread made to bootleg carts. I admit I made myself a couple of bootleg carts too, but that was out of common bad games. If you want to play that game, all you need is an emulator and you know what. It's really that easy, and with NTSC filter or HQ2x filters, the graphics will look the same / better than on a TV with real hardware so no excuse. You can't say as an excuse it's illegal, becuase bootlegs are definitely MORE illegal. Nobody is keeping any knownledge private or anything. (PS : tepples if you are afraid this message would get nesdev in danger feel free to delete it)
<br />
<br />And if you wanted to develop your own VRC4 NES game and asked for a donnor cartridge, that'd be another story. But that don't seem to be the case.

<br />Wow, this is really not cool.  I googled romlab and was shocked as to what I found.
<br />
<br />This is the site.

<br />
<br />Seems a mostly benign, kind of ugly set of pics and guides to rom hacking and repros from the NES to Genesis to Lynx.
<br />
<br />Click on forum at the top menu and then click the forum button in the middle.  See anything familiar?
<br />
<br />Nesdev administrators need to know about this.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Oh man, and a link at the bottom of <a href="http://nintendoallstars.w.interia.pl/romlab/mp3cart.htm" class="postlink">this random page,</a> too.  It could be all over that site.  Linking with a proper explanation is one thing but you don't treat a completely separate, unwitting forum as an extension of your own site.

You will need to track down 2k ram chips though as neighter have WRAM on board and Crisis Force needs it. Also you will have to build\use a famicom adaptor to ge tthe board from 60 to 72 pins. As for your PAL\NTSC issue, well your on your own there.

But after the time you put on it, the eprom, converter etc, it may cost you as much as the original game. So I still think the powerpak is the better option.  
<br />
<br />But if you really like that game and that's the only game you're aiming for, it will be cheaper to buy the original one in the end.

Having it link to here isn't all that bad, just another avenue for people to discover the site.  Though hopefully with more interest than just cart rewiring, but I figure everyone has their own approach to doing stuff with their NES.
