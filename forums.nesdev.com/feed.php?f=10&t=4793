It looks like you could go with CNROM (CHR-ROM) or UNROM (CHR-RAM). Those are some of the simplest boards there are, meaning they are easy to reproduce. The MMC1 has been cloned by bunnyboy, but discrete logic (CNROM, UNROM) is much simpler, and probably enough for your project.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Jan 29, 2009 7:27 am</p><hr />

Personally I prefers CHR-RAM as it allows me to compress my graphics to a suitable format. Also it makes life more difficult for possible CHR-ROM hackers. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=353">oRBIT2002</a> — Thu Jan 29, 2009 6:50 am</p><hr />

Cool.  Thanks guys.  It seems like CHR-ROM makes waay more sense for my needs.  But Sivak mentioned that he chose UNROM and UOROM because they were cheap to put on carts.  Do you know if Mapper 3 or MMC1 are cheap too?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3632">MetalSlime</a> — Thu Jan 29, 2009 5:56 am</p><hr />

For cutscenes, you'd definitely want to have CHR-ROM so that you can have cutscene tiles on the top of the screen and text tiles on the bottom or something like that.<br /><br />Mapper 3 would do if you just want more graphics. If you run out of PRG space, you'd want to switch to either mapper 2 or mapper 1.<br /><br />Also, by "one-screen" game do you mean you have only one screen shown at a time or that it requires one-screen mirroring ? Because only mappers 1 and 7 (among with much less common mappers) allow one-screen mirroring officially.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Jan 29, 2009 2:48 am</p><hr />

Perhaps you'd want to go with MMC1, and about 16k of CHR ROM. It's possible movies would take up a bit of space, so if you need to use more than 32k of PRG you could move up to 64k, which would give you the specs of Dragon Warrior. But I think 64k is kind of a waste if you're not going to use it all.<br /><br />I'd suggest trying to have 32k of PRG and 16k of CHR ROM. It doesn't seem like you'd benefit much from CHR RAM with a small project, and if you don't feel limited by it, CHR ROM is much easier to deal with.<br /><br />Look at this list of games/mappers:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tuxnes.sourceforge.net/nesmapper.txt">http://tuxnes.sourceforge.net/nesmapper.txt</a><!-- m --><br /><br />It might be outdated, but I don't know. You may find it helpful in choosing a mapper.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Wed Jan 28, 2009 10:06 pm</p><hr />

Hello,<br /><br />I'm designing a one-screen game and I'm trying to decide what mapper to use, if any.  I don't think my game will need extra PRG-ROM at all, so really it comes down to CHR.<br /><br />My game isn't complex.  It will have a title-screen with a picture and text, a main gameplay screen with a relatively static background, credits.  Sounds like Mapper 0 (no mapper) is the way to go so far... but!<br /><br />But I want to have little cut scenes in between levels to tell the story.  Something like <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4520" class="postlink">the intro that Roth has for his zombie game</a>, but with more text.  　I think it will require more background tiles than a single page of CHR-ROM will give me.　　If I understand correctly, I need a Mapper to get more CHR space. (correct me if I am wrong!)<br /><br />So switchable CHR-ROM or writable CHR-RAM?  I was thinking about using UNROM (CHR-RAM), but only because that's the mapper I am most familiar with (and it looks extremely easy to use).  Do you think this is a good choice?  If not, why not.<br /><br />One last thing: I'd like to put my game on a cart (possibly several) when I finish, so I want to make sure I pick a mapper that will make this as painless as possible.<br /><br />Which mapper would you choose?<br /><br />Thanks a lot! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3632">MetalSlime</a> — Wed Jan 28, 2009 9:44 pm</p><hr />
