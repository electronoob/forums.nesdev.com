		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I thought so. Probably because the demo scene became big with the C64 and the C64 was most popular in Europe.<br /><br />I'm still surprised that some demo artists <em>require</em> the system to run on PAL, though.<br /><br />I mean, first of all, that's not a C64. They code their stuff on modern, region-independent PCs and test it on emulators that have NTSC as the default option.<br /><br />So, not only did they consciously alter the default option from the master console version, that 99 % of the games were programmed for, to the localized version of the country they happen to live in.<br />They also decided to use features that only work on their own version and are totally incompatible with the most common version of the console.

But even when the extra vblank time isn't absolutely necessary, a person living in a PAL country might think that optimizing the code isn't worth the time and the trouble.

Maybe in the 90s when I didn't know better, but not in today's time.<br /><br />Besides, I would never program a game to be incompatible with either version at all. Even my NTSC game runs on both consoles. On PAL in 50 Hz, but it runs. And I even let it adjust the music in the beginning.<br />And if it had relied on something like timed code (for example for raster effects*), I would have included an if-else for these parts.<br /><br />So, yeah, taking PAL as the master is fine if that's home for you. But I don't like it if people abuse features that work <em>only</em> on one console.<br /><br />* I use the nine sprite overflow flag and sprite 0 for raster effects, so no timing adjustment necessary if you pay attention that the level is designed in a way, so that the pixel line with the split consists only of one color.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Maybe that's just payback for all the craply converted games they got, with slow music, slow gameplay, and broken raster effects.</div><br />&quot;Nintendo treated us badly.

In a demo, on the other hand - some boundaries of the system may be region specific. If you want to explore such a boundary, you don't have much choice. And the user case is very different. A demo is supposed to probably be shown for those who might appreciate the code acrobatics in relation to the limits of the hardware; both requiring at least some prior knowledge; studied or experienced. Or at a party where the VJ knows what system it should be shown on.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />High Hopes is PAL solely because back then I only owned a PAL NES (it's obligatory to run the demo on the real hardware at Assembly, where it competed). There were also no flash carts around when I was working on the demo (PowerPak came out right after) so I used a gutted Bart vs the World cart. Didn't cross my mind to import an NTSC NES + game(s). <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />All that said, even though I do own an NTSC NES nowadays, I might still target PAL NES for a new demo, because nostalgia and the other reasons mentioned so far.<br /><br />(High Hopes doesn't utilize the longer vblank time. As a sidenote, none of the effects use any MMC3 features either, they're all NROM-compatible.)
