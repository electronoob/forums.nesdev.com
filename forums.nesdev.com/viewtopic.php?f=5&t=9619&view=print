		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I... smell a topic split. <br /><br />This laptop isn't really good enough to have Aero enabled (nor can it get better drivers than what I've got), but that's not why I disabled it at first. I just prefer the solid colors and no title bar transparency. I want my UIs as plain as possible. I liked Windows Office better before the ribbon and gradients as well. I make NES games, like old GUIs, and live in a place much earlier than 1996. I think most who are part of this community do in at least some small way.<br /><br />But even if my computer was good enough for me to not feel the performance loss, I still wouldn't want my GUI to use any more CPU than it has to. It'd be cool if whenever I buy a new computer, the GUI doesn't take the same percentage of CPU as it did on the old computer because of gloss that doesn't help me get tasks done. I can deal with tearing, and I've only ever encountered a few &quot;problem programs&quot; that must be run in Aero to use at all... (constant alternating between a black screen and what it should be, or just black all the time. Sort of like what's described in <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=9612&amp;p=104743&amp;hilit=flicker#p104736" class="postlink">this post.</a>)<br /><br />Re: Aero's thick borders. That was another concern of mine, but you CAN just make them smaller. Annoyingly (at least on Vista), those options give you a preview of what the changes you're making will look like in the classic theme and not the Aero theme... You have to constantly apply and adjust to see what they look like in Aero. I actually did customize the size and color of the various parts of windows when I was using XP, but now I don't bother. <br /><br />I'm sure you can get solid color title bars and the other things I like with clever theming. But eh... going through all that when classic is close to what I want is silly.

When they realize Windows 8 doesn't appeal to power users and desktop PC users, Windows 8 will become another branch of Windows (much like NT vs. 9x), and a sequel to 7 more appropriate to desktop PCs will be developed (whether Windows or otherwise). This is my hypothesis.<br /><br />As for translucency and other things, in 7, if you go to Control Panel &gt; Performance Information and Tools &gt; (in the sidebar) Adjust Visual Effects, you can turn all of the fancy stuff off (such as the see-through titlebars and the animations) and still have Aero. I don't know if Vista is the same way.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A window consists of a viewport surrounded by borders.

Even if it didn't, mobile screens have been experiencing a gradual increase in DPI (Remember when your cellphone used to have a 48x32 display?). And even though it's very popular to think developers are idiots, I <em>think</em> they would realize they've made a mistake when they've made the borders so big that they literally cover a quarter of the screen.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I also love how Microsoft sets the bottom and right borders of a in-focus window to <span style="color: #40FFFF"><strong>bright fucking cyan</strong></span> in Basic and Classic mode too -- it looks fantastic, especially when using darker colours on your desktop or applications!  And it's <strong>not adjustable either</strong> (don't tell me to go run some of those third-party DWM hackish apps -- I've tried two, they either don't work, or they crash).<br /><br />I've also noticed that dragging/resizing windows is not as smooth in some modes (Aero vs. non-Aero vs. Classic), which is quite amusing given that Windows Vista and 7 are highly DX-driven, thus GPU-driven.<br /><br />What really chaps my ass about every Windows release since XP is that the underlying kernel and many device drivers actually improve -- meaning what goes on under the hood, deep down, is actually good.  It's everything else that turns to shit -- you know, all the stuff you see *constantly* due to the fact that it's a GUI-based OS.

How many of these users <em>actually</em> customized the UI? Obviously not many if all they want is classic mode. ;)</div><br /><br />I could seriously write a book on all the absolute UI monstrosities that are become apparent when using Basic or Classic mode.  I'm not joking.  You're the 5th or 6th person who has wanted me (in effect) to document the problems with Windows Vista/7's UI when using <strong>anything</strong> other than Aero with all the bells and shitwhistles turned on.  Absolutely <strong>no one</strong> did usability testing for Basic or Classic, all while removing features and &quot;screwing around&quot; (leaving shit broken).<br /><br />I had to use Windows Vista and 7 at my past job (guess where -- MICROSOFT!) as it was mandatory company-wide by MSIT and MS Security.  For 5 years I had the &quot;joy&quot; of using these OSes 8 hours a day, so I became quite familiar with the brokenness.  Five years later, I <strong>still</strong> cannot get over the brokenness.  In fact, coming home to my XP workstation was actually bliss, simply because I didn't have to tolerate all the continual in-my-face broken UI crap -- it was like coming home to a good blow job every day.  Seriously.<br /><br />Here's a short list off the top of my head:<br /><br />* Basic: try adjusting some of the Personalisation settings under &quot;Window Colour&quot;.  You will find many of them are no-ops<br /><br />* Classic mode: where is &quot;Colour scheme&quot; support (i.e. Rainy Day, etc.)?  It's been completely removed.  This is not the same thing as &quot;theme&quot; support<br /><br />* Classic mode: under Window Colour and Appearance, many of the pulldown items do not let you adjust font sizes and colours (in 9x/2K/XP they did)<br /><br />* Classic mode: moving/dragging an icon on the desktop shows a rectangular dithered shitbox rather than the actual icon itself (and if you tell me &quot;it's because of the removal of hardware acceleration in Classic&quot;, then I ask you to explain the translucent selection rectangle still being available -- dragging icons around is not a &quot;hardware accelerated&quot; thing, the CPU has to do most of the work)<br /><br />* Basic and Classic mode: cyan border around bottom and right edges of window to indicate has-focus; colour is non-adjustable<br /><br />* Basic and Classic mode: turn off ClearType and &quot;font smoothing&quot; (separate things; latter is called &quot;Smooth edges of screen fonts&quot;).  Now go into the Control Panel and ask yourself if you can actually read the text in there.  I'm specifically referring to many applets/etc. assuming use of ClearType/font smoothing, resulting in blurry-as-fuck text  I can't provide screenshots of this because it looks different in a VM than on actual hardware<br /><br />* Toggling ClearType and &quot;font smoothing&quot; will result in some fonts showing significantly bolder than normal, <strong>until you reboot</strong>, where the fonts then begin appearing correctly.  100% reproducible<br /><br />* IE9 and IE10: ClearType is forced on in these applications, regardless of system setting.  (This used to be a feature in IE which you could toggle and they removed it -- there is still quite a backlash from the customer base about that.  But it still makes no sense why this is being forced on)<br /><br />* ClearType and &quot;font smoothing&quot; greatly degrade overall UI performance (menus take longer to expand/draw, window contents take longer to draw and often scroll, etc.).  I disable these, by the way, because I find they look like utter crap -- they turn my text into fuzzy, blurry piles of junk.  I don't like things screwing with my text.  Font hinting, blah blah -- it looks great on paper when printed, but it doesn't look that great on most LCDs I use.  ClearType just makes it even worse.  But despite my personal preferences, given that these features adjust most (not all -- see items above) of the in-UI text, it's very important things be designed to work with all 4 combinations (CT=off FS=off, CT=off FS=on, CT=on FS=off, CT=on FS=on), rather than just the latter<br /><br />* Partially Microsoft to blame for this one: applications change their entire UI layouts based on which mode you're in.  For example, look at Firefox with Aero enabled, Aero disabled, and in Classic.  Classic will give you the <a href="http://tothepc.com/img/2010/07/firefox-menu-bar-21.png" class="postlink">original File/Edit/etc. menu bar</a>, while <a href="http://blogs.sitepointstatic.com/images/tech/502-firefox-4-week1-menu.png" class="postlink">the others do not</a>.  You can enable that menu bar while in Aero, but guess what you end up with?  A <a href="http://www.itechtalk.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=6112" class="postlink">title and menu bar that looks like glowing inverted dildo with text on it</a> (it's so easy to read!  Really!).  Furthermore, the &quot;redesigned&quot; menu bar (i.e. when non-Classic is in use and Menu Bar is disabled) makes using the Bookmarks feature annoying as shit.  I should note no other application I've encountered behaves this way, including classic applications like Wireshark (which have a consistent-looking UI no matter what mode you're in).<br /><br /><strong>There are absolutely no justified reasons for any of the above -- it is just pure 100% negligence.</strong>  Furthermore, Windows 7 has been out since 2009, and already has one Service Pack out -- yet these problems/issues are still not fixed.  Wonder why?<br /><br />So I ask you plain and simple: how much of this is &quot;living in 1996&quot;?  The correct answer is: none -- it's &quot;living with head up ass in 2007+&quot; (Vista came out in 2007).

This is specifically in regards to Drag's words: &quot;but what's so bad about getting used to them, other than &quot;oh no, it's different&quot;?&quot;  This was not a case of &quot;oh its different, screw it&quot; -- I seriously had to use this crap for 5 years (2 for Vista, 3 for Windows 7).<br /><br />The fact that I worked at Microsoft has absolutely zero bearing on the bugs at hand too.  People often think &quot;because you work at company X, you can do something about some bugs!&quot;  Sadly it's untrue.  There are quite literally <strong>hundreds</strong> (I would say quite literally 400-500) of teams/divisions at Microsoft internationally, with no easy way to track down who's responsible for what.  On an off-day I spent a few hours trying to figure out what team was handling these kinds of issues and was unable to determine who to contact or how to bring these issues to light internally; e.g. there is no team called &quot;Windows 7 UI Dev Team&quot;.  Welcome to the corporate world.<br /><br />There's also the PR aspect.  We had very strict nation-wide conduct compliance rules pertaining to blog and forum posts relating to Microsoft products.  Even disclaimers like &quot;I speak for myself and not on behalf of my employer&quot; do not matter -- if you work for company X and say &quot;yeah, product Y from company X could be better&quot;, you're effectively acting as a spokesperson for the company and that can get you into trouble with HR.  I did have this happen WRT something I said on a public forum, but it wasn't with regards to any Microsoft software products (it was with regards to a customer of ours who claimed I was &quot;disclosing confidential information&quot; about a service outage on their network -- an internal review conducted concluded I was not disclosing confidential information, but for PR/company image reasons I was asked to have the forum moderator nuke the contents of my post).  Again: welcome to the corporate world.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Yes, I miss the theme, I liked &quot;Rainy Day&quot; and another one I don't remember. However you can still change the colours manually if you wish, while keeping in the classic windows look, so it's not that bad.</div><br />Like I said: there are many Windows Appearance and Colour options which either have no effect or cannot be changed to the same degree as on Windows 9x/2K/XP.  I know, because I spent a few hours trying to get Classic to look like Rainy Day, and failed.  I also tried some official and unofficial &quot;themes&quot; for Windows 7 (Aero) that claimed to be &quot;much like Rainy Day&quot; but either did not work or required all the bells/whistles be turned on (along with making use of the horrible glass effect that you and I both find annoying :-) ).<br /><br />Before I left MS, I took notes of what my UI settings were.  I had to write all these down by hand with the help of a co-worker, but I got them all.  This is about &quot;as good as I could get it&quot; -- and we were using Firefox 3.x (for reasons I'd rather not get into) so the aforementioned Firefox UI issue was not a problem.  I'll put the details at the bottom of this post.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Go try to use Gnome 3 and you'll see what is a horrible GUI.</div><br />Regardless if GNOME 3 sucks or not, the fact of the matter is we're running out of choices on Windows.  Windows Vista and 7 destroy customisation capability, and Windows 8 inhibits it even more.  This might work for generic users who have no idea how to use a computer, but for technically-inclined users this is a hindrance.  Hell, even my own mother -- who is a generic end user by all means, and is in her late 50s -- cannot stand all the bells and shitwhistles of Windows 7, but finds the UI to look even worse if she goes with Classic.  She's tried for the past 5 years as well to get used to it, and has &quot;mostly&quot; adapted,but there are still many things she rants to me about when I'm on the phone with her about some computer issue.<br /><br />Anyway, here's my notes, circa March 2012:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">$ ls -l w7<br />-rw-------&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 jdc&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;users&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2956 Mar&nbsp; 9&nbsp; 2012 w7<br /><br />$ cat w7<br />Issues with Windows 7<br />=======================<br />- Microsoft buggered the busy cursor animation<br />&nbsp; http://www.istartedsomething.com/20090815/windows-7-busy-cursor-misses-a-beat/<br />- Removal of adjustable settings when using Windows Classic; all settings under<br />&nbsp; Appearance are adjustable but *do not actually change anything*<br />- Removal of Colour Schemes when using Windows Classic, such as Rainy Day.<br />&nbsp; Imitation themes online require Windows 7 theme hacks (which violate SFC),<br />&nbsp; and some just look like plain crap<br />- Disabling ClearType does not do so universally in the OS; many things still<br />&nbsp; force use of ClearType, such as bits/pieces of Control Panel and underlying<br />&nbsp; applets<br />- No volume licensing; activation (thus a phone call) required every time<br />&nbsp; hardware changes.&nbsp; &quot;Hacks&quot; are available for this but either cause more issues<br />&nbsp; than worth it, or require a custom bootloader/bootstrap (&quot;DaX method&quot;).<br /><br /><br />- Start with Aero enabled<br /><br /><br />Control Panel -&gt; Appearance and Personalisation -&gt; Personalise<br />================================================================<br />- Change desktop icons<br />&nbsp; - All checked EXCEPT Control Panel<br />- Change mouse pointers<br />&nbsp; - Scheme --&gt; None<br />- Desktop Background<br />&nbsp; - Set to whatever you want<br />- Sounds --&gt; No Sounds<br />- Window Colour<br />&nbsp; - Enable transparency unchecked<br />&nbsp; - Colour intensity&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; slider is maxed<br />&nbsp; - Colour mixer&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; green-blue-ish colour<br />&nbsp; - Advanced appearance settings<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Active Title Bar&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft Sans Serif, 8pt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Application Background&nbsp; &nbsp; Color 1 RGB: 115,115,115<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Border Padding&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0px<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Caption Buttons&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;18px<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Icon&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft Sans Serif, 8pt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Inactive Title Bar&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft Sans Serif, 8pt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Menu&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft Sans Serif, 8pt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Message Box&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Microsoft Sans Serif, 8pt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Palette Title&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Microsoft Sans Serif, 8pt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Scrollbar&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;16px<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Selected Items&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft Sans Serif, 8pt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Tooltip&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Microsoft Sans Serif, 8pt<br /><br />Control Panel -&gt; Appearance and Personalisation -&gt; Fonts<br />==========================================================<br />- Adjust ClearType text<br />&nbsp; - Turn on ClearType --&gt; UNCHECKED<br />&nbsp; - Click &quot;Next&quot; through all defaults<br /><br />Control Panel -&gt; System and Security -&gt; System -&gt; Advanced System Settings<br />============================================================================<br />- Performance -&gt; Settings<br />&nbsp; - All checkboxes UNCHECKED except:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - desktop composition<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Show transluscent selection rectangle<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Show window contents while dragging<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Use drop shadows for icon labels on the desktop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Use visual styles on windows and buttons<br /><br />Desktop Properties<br />====================<br />- View -&gt; Small icons<br /><br />Taskbar Properties<br />====================<br />- Use small icons --&gt; checked<br />- Notification Area -&gt; Customise<br />&nbsp; - Always show all icons and notifications on taskbar --&gt; checked<br />- Toolbars<br />&nbsp; - Quick Launch --&gt; you get to deal with finding out how you did this :D<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-7/add-the-quick-launch-bar-to-the-taskbar-in-windows-7/<br /></div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, well two possibilities then. Windows 7 becomes Windows XP all over again (as in, 15 years later, we're still using it, all while Microsoft is frantically and unsuccessfully trying to push Windows NewEdition), or &quot;Hey Mac, Hey Linux, sorry for not really talking to you guys, but I think it's time we get to know ourselves a little more personally.&quot;<br /><br />For right exactly now, I'm ok living with Windows 7 even if it's a little different from XP, especially since I'm fine with Aero, and don't really need to customize the UI outside of changing the sizes of the borders and titlebars and the fonts therein (which all went off without a hitch, by the way). That's why I want to see what they're going to do after Windows 8. I have a very hard time believing that they actually think it's a good idea to ditch the standard desktop metaphor that we've all been fine with for the past 30+ years.
