<br />
<br />FWIW, I agree.  Besides, bunnyboy is just one guy... one busy guy.  I hope he's sitting at home rubbing his belly that's filled with turkey.
<br />
<br />Also, for sake of comparison: do you know what SWC and MGH copiers cost back in the early 90s?  You know, the copiers all us homebrewn devs purchased so we could run/test our own code?  US$400-500, and that's hardly an exaggeration -- I knew a guy who paid $700 for the Super Wildcard DX when it came out.
<br />
<br />And we had to send our code to the console via parallel port, in DOS, hoping that the transfer wouldn't crap out.  And if you didn't have a parallel port, or you couldn't get yours to work with the sender software?  1.44MB floppies.  Try copying a 1MB file to a floppy sometime to remind yourself of old days...
<br />
<br />We would've killed for something like the SNES PowerPak back then.  So to me, US$135 is a hell of a good deal.  But it all depends on perspective... or maybe I'm just bitter with old age.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Also it's important to point out the alternatives. There are many of those same Copiers still out there. But if you want to get one that has 48M+ of RAM, DSP1 support, etc it will cost you about as much as the PowerPAK. Plus the PowerPAK doesn't require a secondary power source like most Copiers do. It also doesn't force you to suffer with the horrifying Floppy Disk loading like some Copiers do and even in a better case scenario you need a Parallel Port and a PC setup to send from which I do. The best case is that you have a Copier with a CDROM or Harddrive but that's only best case for massive ROM storage and isn't as easy to add games to it. 
<br />
<br />I would agree that it's not a cheap device, but unlike those Nintendo DS pirate devices that are, this device has alot more going on inside it and more parts to it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />While the SNES Powerpak is not without its faults, it is by far the best device of its kind ever made.  With one Compact Flash card and the DSP1 upgrade you can have virtually the whole SNES library (97% of US SNES games work) at your disposal.  You can input up to five Game Genie codes and write battery-backed save games to a file.  You can load games directly from the SNES and organize them into subdirectories.  No more floppies, CDs, or parallel cables.  This I think is well worth $146.00
