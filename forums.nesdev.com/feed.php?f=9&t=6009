The schematic is little more than buffer chips and an SRAM in the middle.  The only special feature is that it has some wire posts for positive and negative reset.  So that can be wired to the reset button for an auto-reset after upload.  I'm thinking I may provide for that if I do a later Squeedo revision.  But JMP ($FFFC) is enough when the program is under control.<br /><br />Single-stepping the hardware would be a mess, it would definitely take some rewiring of the system.  Or better yet, some logic to take over the ROM "Game Genie-style" and output a NOP/wait loop.  I wonder if the PowerPak could do that.  kevtris wrote a single-step mode on CopyNES, it's actually implemented as a 6502 emulator on the 6502.  It certainly works well, but when it comes to disassembling or mucking around with the Program Counter I find that easy to do in FCEU or Nintendulator (because then you've got cycle-perfect video).<br /><br />When I was working on Squeedo there were times when I would take certain values and print hex chars to the screen as sprites.  That worked alright.  Squeedo also has an LED which has been greatly useful as a debug output.  Blinking, toggling, or watching it glow brighter/dimmer depending on the main loop's idle time, for example.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I also much rather prefer not having to alt+tab around between crap when I could just be writing the code and only have to hit 1 key<br /></div><br />I configured Gedit on my Ubuntu laptop so that when I press F5 in a project's source code folder, it looks for a  makefile in the parent folder and runs it.

Actually there are general-purpose EPROM emulators that will do exactly what you want.  I'm sure there are some decent ones around now, but they've always been kind of expensive and are definitely becoming of old-fashioned by now (when I looked around I see some people use them for hacking their car/engine computer though).  The one I have was made in 1992, it does 8kB to 512kB, I've had it for about 10 years.  It cost me a small fortune at the time, I think almost $200, but was well worth it.<br /><br />It's great because with this you can totally ditch NES emulators.  Hell, I've made several unique NES boards, testing code for those on an NES emulator is not even an option.  I also much rather prefer not having to alt+tab around between crap when I could just be writing the code and only have to hit 1 key and look over to see the result.<br /><br />Making a devkit that's ALMOST that easy was one of the main design goals of my Squeedo project.  It uses FlashROM instead of SRAM though, so it's slower to upload for the advantage of keeping it's programming  (but you can load to it's 32kB WRAM if you use the right program origin).  I started that project back in 2004, work stalled out while I had other real-life issues to deal with.  But finally this year I will be getting some prototypes into the hands of a few certain developers.  Having more software for it definitely makes it easier for me to put into production.  Unlike the PowerPak, it doesn't emulate mappers, it's a 100% original design.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Feb 03, 2010 2:22 pm</p><hr />

It's possible to make a perfectly accurate single-chip NES, with CPU, PPU, and two 2Kx8-bit RAMs on one die, especially now that all mask work rights and patents on the NES have expired.

As far as I know there are no clones that are an exact replica.  Instead of using multiple chips they use a single chip (NOAC NesOnAChip).  It is much cheaper than having multiple chips, but they rely on their own programming and therefore differ from original hardware programming.  The USB CopyNES requires you to desolder the original CPU and attach it to the CopyNES board, so that eliminates all famiclones/NOAC consoles.<br /><br />Besides, nothing beats the accuracy and authentic feel of the original IMO.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4091">WhatULive4</a> — Wed Feb 03, 2010 4:48 am</p><hr />

Clones are just "close enough" replicas of the real deal, which means they are different in some areas, and these details are enough to prevent some carts with specialized hardware that depends on them to not work, including the PowerPak and games using the MMC5 mapper. And like it's been said, the CopyNES does not work on clones.<br /><br />Anyway, if you are serious about programming for the NES you NEED the real console. Clones generate the wrong colors, the wrong sound, and some are even known to have timing issues, so they do not make good testing platforms for NES software.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Feb 02, 2010 6:26 am</p><hr />

[quote="tokumaru"<br />Not that you will need a CopyNES (which you'll need to install yourself) in order to use the PowerPak Lite, so it's not that much cheaper in the end. Also remember that these products don't work on clones, so you need an actual Nintendo console.[/quote]<br /><br /><br />That's another problen then!!!<br />The console I am using I think is a Famicom clone. Where would I get an original console? OR can the clone console be "fixed" so that powerpak lite works on it?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4104">Nadia</a> — Tue Feb 02, 2010 5:07 am</p><hr />
