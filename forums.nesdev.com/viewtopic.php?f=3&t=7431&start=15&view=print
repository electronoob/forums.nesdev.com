<br />
<br />It's possible to discern 6502 code from data with heuristics.  Just like the frequency of occurance of letters in the English language, 6502 opcodes occur with a characteristic frequency.
<br />
<br />Plus, data tables (at least of pointers) sometimes fall into easy to spot patterns.  Disjoint tables of LSM and MSB pointers will tend to have slowly increasing sets of MSBs, and LSBs increasing much faster.
<br />
<br />Many years ago I once attempted to write an Atari 2600 disassembler that would auto-comment code based on the TIA registers that the code accessed.  It tried to determine if the byte stream that it was looking at was code or data based on some of the above heuristics, and a few others.  Sadly, I never completed the project.  I suppose that a proper treatment for an automatic dissembler would be to include static code analysis.

<br />Then don't rely so much on naive static code analysis. It'd break on the Super NES, which needs more state to interpret an instruction (E, M, X bits) and only two truly unused opcodes (STP and WDM). If the program counter enters an area, it's likely code. If load instructions, it's likely data. FCEUX can log this. Relocation into RAM can break this.

<br />
<br />EDIT: I've updated the PPU to pass some more tests, including one compile time setting affecting sprite overflow calculation. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcS-gcOuOy8" class="postlink">The result still sucks</a>.

<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Acc = $B3<br />$0047 = $A5</div><br />...and I execute the zero-page addressing (opcode $07) SLO with [SLO $47].  Then the final result should be:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Acc = $FB &#40;$A5 left shift one bit and then OR'd with $B3&#41;<br />$0047 = $4A &#40;i.e. $A5 left shift 1 bit&#41;<br />PS&#91;C&#93; = 1 &#40;since $A5 left shifts into the carry bit&#41;<br />PS&#91;N&#93; = 1 &#40;since MSbit of $FB = 1&#41;<br />PS&#91;Z&#93; = 0 &#40;since Acc != 0&#41;</div>
<br />Is that correct?

<br />
<br />And another one. The <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Programming_with_unofficial_opcodes" class="postlink">wiki says</a> that opcode ANC ($0B) "Does not modify Z."  But <a href="http://members.chello.nl/taf.offenga/illopc31.txt" class="postlink">illopc31.txt</a> says that it does.  Anyone know which is correct?

<br />
<br />There's a simple reason why it doesn't work on hardware actually, and that's because I didn't have a dev-cart. Or a NES. Or a TV, actually ;)
<br />To be honest I did receive a gracious offer from thefox to help test it properly, but the code was beginning to smell and I still had some frustrating bugs to work out, so I lost interest and moved on to other things (as usual.)
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I've only tested it on PAL NES, maybe somebody could verify if it doesn't work on NTSC NES either. It does work in Nestopia in PAL mode, and IIRC it was designed to be PAL compatible.</div>As I recall the demo was built for NTSC machines. Though there was a compile-time setting for use with PAL consoles.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">doynax, if you're still lurking around, let me know if you need help with testing some stuff on real NES to get that bad boy running. :)</div>If you've got a little time to spare and perhaps a web-cam or capture card, then I'm certainly willing to give it whirl. It seems a shame not to even try getting it running on the real thing.

<br />Just look up me up on Skype or something.

<br />I would say just forget about any lingering graphics bugs (if that's specifically what you're talking about) - the poly3 demo looks _amazing_ as is.  Just leave the core code (algorithms and such) alone and just work on making it "real-NES compatible".  Just my 2 cents.
<br />
<br />I really hope you guys can get this working!
