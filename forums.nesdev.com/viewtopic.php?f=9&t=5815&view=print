<br />
<br />Does anybody know if the MGD6 iis also usable with the Totek cable to write to FDS disks from a PC? It looks like an upgrade of the MGD1, but I don't know if it'll work in the same way...
<br />
<br />I really want to write some patch disks (translations) and I have a couple disks with ERR 05, so I need to re-write them. 
<br />
<br />Speaking of which, does anybody have a list of the FDS Error codes and what they mean?
<br />
<br />I'd be happy to U/L a photo of my FDS collection if anybody thinks I'm just thinking of pirating games. I don't need to: I just need to re-write a couple disks and overwrite disks with translated RPGs. 
<br />
<br />Nothing illegal here.

<br />Error 05 isn't a common error, you won't necessarily be able to fix it by rewriting the disks. Most of the time, bad disks have fine data integrity, they just have developed a physical defect.
<br />
<br />You can get a list of common errors in the FDS' instruction manual or here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/FDS%20technical%20reference.txt">http://nesdev.com/FDS%20techni ... erence.txt</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />If you only need to fix a couple disks, it'd typically be more cost effective to purchase even brand-new copies of the games over a MGD setup. Someone could probably write your translations to disk for you too. Keep in mind the MGD doesn't work with FwNES (.FDS) files, nor do either of the transfer programs, so it'd be advisable to be able to figure out the differences between the formats and program your own simple tools.

<br />
<br />Rewriting bad disks is only an afterthought: it'd be nice to be able to do so, but the patched RPGs are my priority. The economy of rewriting my disks comes in that after doing what I need to do for patching my games, I'll already have what I need to rewrite mad media. 
<br />
<br />I can order disks all day long from Rising or other Nippon-based importers, but why should I replace what I already have if I can fix it with equipment I already own.
<br />
<br />I’m certainly amicable to having somebody else write the patched disks, but as far as I can tell, nobody is able to do that, or I'd have had an answer on how to do so on my own already.

<br />Many people are happy to share their knowledge, and often their work, but many also just don't have anything gift-wrapped for people. In this case I have a parallel port &lt;-&gt; expansion port cable that can do many things, including dump/write disks, but it's still pretty complicated to use, it's not electrically reliable yet and I don't really care about releasing another thing to help people pirate the disks. Nobody would care about the cable itself or the communication protocol, which I'd be happy to show off, just the end result.
<br />
<br />Since like you say, this is a community of development and hacking, we tend to have a pretty DIY ethic. I think you should go with a USB CopyNES (might fit in a FC) and get started on a plugin for FDS. That would benefit the most people, especially yourself from the experience <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Pasofami? That's a new one on me and I'll have to do some research down that avenue.
<br />
<br />Frankly, I'm a hardware engineer (semi-retired) and writing software of this nature is not in my realm of experience. When I was in college, Cobol was the "in" language to learn...
<br />
<br />Did you code custom tools to use your cable design? If you have a schematic, I'd be happy to both build one and possibly work out some of the problems. If I can manage an improved design, would you feel it worthwhile to exchange that for whatever tools you use or for writing services?
<br />
<br />What problems are you encountering with your cable? 
<br />
<br />If you or anybody out there would be willing to write the patches, I would be happy to both compensate you for your time and supply original diskettes (of the original games to be patched) to use in the process. More than anything else, I'd like English-language versions of 'Deep Dungeon' and 'Cleopatra', although I'm not 100% certain if there is a translation for the latter. 
<br />
<br />As I said before, if I wanted pirated games, I could buy them all day long from China for very little money and thus having this type of setup just to duplicate FamiDisks is not time-money practical. 
<br />
<br />Being able to write the patched English games is, however, of great interest to me, as I can't read the Japanese characters and learning a new language at my age is not likely to happen. I have all the documentation I would need now to make disk-to-disk copies, but that doesn't help me with my primary concern. 
<br />
<br />I frankly don’t even see why that is such a large concern here. I guess I’ll just have to photograph my disk collection just to show you what I mean… 
<br />
<br />Then again, I still have yet to U/L the photos of the NES2 logic board, so I may as well do both at once.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It sounds like you are trying to use a parallel port under Windows to transfer data over a serial data connection. I suggest not using a Parallel port at all, as part of the data loss may be due to DTR rate problems with older hardware and it's easier to utilize hardware-based speed choking on a serial interface.
<br />
<br />By expansion port, are you meaning the 15-pin (DA-15) port or the Nintendo-specific port on the FDS/Sharp Twin (port B)?
<br />
<br />If your software is simple enough, you could always recompile it under BSD or something else and check to see if it's a Kernel issue by running it with your hardware under a different OS, however I suspect that this isn’t the case. 
<br />
<br />I also advise against reducing the wire count, as this will only likely result in higher degradation of your signals. What spec wire are you using and are you sure that it is properly shielded and insulated?
<br />
<br />Remember that the slower interface from the FDS will require more shielding and insulation in your cable, depending on its length, as it is more susceptible to data corruption from ES/EM interference.
