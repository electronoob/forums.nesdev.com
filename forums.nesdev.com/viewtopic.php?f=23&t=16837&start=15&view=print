I'd prefer it to be a bit more proportional to the body. The legs however looks fine, I don't mind the oversized legs Rockman robots have, it's part of the style. The shoulder however makes it look like his torso is facing almost straight into the camera, while the head and legs are facing forward (which is fine). I'd like the torso to be angled a tad bit more forward. Not too much though, the reason fighting stances have the body angled is to make your body a smaller target. The more you angle the torso the smaller the target becomes but it will also be harder to move. When facing an enemy with a weapon, he has longer reach so you will want to become a smaller target than in unarmed combat.<br /><br />I'm only trying to give you constructive critic, and yes it's my own opinion of course. Feel free to do with it as you please.

Using qualifiers such as &quot;definitely&quot; or &quot;obviously&quot; makes it seem like one view is inherently more valid than others when we're talking about subjective material.

It's always available, regardless of what the graphics chip is doing.  Each one of the 8 DMA channels can be set to activate during HBlank (in between scanlines) and write one, two, or four bytes from a table in ROM or RAM to a location on the B bus.  The table includes line counter values that control which lines the writes happen on - it can be every line, or once in a frame, or anything in between.<br /><br />This can be used for scroll changes, palette changes, BG mode changes, window setting changes, colour math changes - just about every register on the PPU bus can be poked during HBlank with HDMA.  You can change Mode 7 settings with HDMA; this is actually how F-Zero-type perspective is done, since Mode 7 on its own can only do 2D affine transformations.  You can even stream audio to the SPC700 with HDMA if you're good at writing timed code on the S-SMP, as demonstrated by d4s in N-Warp Daisakusen.  It's a very powerful feature.<br /><br />The Mega Drive just has line scroll (and row scroll, which is a subset of line scroll in terms of the actual result).  Anything else needs to be done manually in an interrupt.

The proportions on this one definitely looks worse than both originals IMHO.</div><br /><br />Still not sure how the proportions look worse in the mock-up compared to the 32-bit style when they're pretty much the same though. Height-wise, the head to overall body ratio is basically 1:3 in both 32-bit and the mock-up. Biggest difference is width-wise (back of the helmet to the nose), which is a ratio of 0.4 in the 32-bit version and 0.36 in the mock-up. Perhaps you mean that you'd like to see a bigger, more defined face in the mock-up?<br /><br />I do understand that the 16-bit style has its advantages because the sprite isn't all that large to begin with, and generally Mega Man games in the 90s gave Mega Man an oversized head. Makes sense in the NES and GB versions to give the character something obvious and defining the player can see on-screen. 32-bit could take advantage of much taller sprites, so the head proportions in almost every other 2D Mega Man game shrank (even on the GBA). So maybe one solution a mock-up could investigate is a bigger sprite. But then you'd need to consider my point below about other MMX characters.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Sumez wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Absolutely. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I mostly like the look of the 2D MMX games on PS1, but X himself wasn't really an improvement.

I basically liked every Mega Man game, stylistically speaking, so I have no preference, and I think it's neat seeing something new. From my perspective the mock-up X doesn't really clash with the BG, but I can totally see where he'd look noticeably different from the bosses, or Sigma, or Zero, unless all of those characters are handled as well. As a stand-alone screenshot, however, it works imo, but tackling all the other art assets would be much trickier.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Shonumi basically echoes my reasoning for the design. I don't consider myself an actual sprite artist in the first place and worked with the 32-bit sprite as a reference as noted. I tried just color reducing the original sprite at first but the decrease in fidelity just looked too obvious and thought that could be mitgated by presenting something different. Plus, I did find the chibi head to be kinda offputting when I started thinking more about it and generally prefer the more &quot;realistic&quot; style of 16-bit characters with more implicit facial features.<br /><br />Anyway, I didn't really mean for this thread to turn into a pages long debate on the sprite itself.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, right now I'm in the middle of working on the CPS Punisher game. There was already a Genesis port of this by Sculptured Software (same studio that ported Mortal Kombat 3), but visually it leaves a lot to be desired (the spritework in particular is pretty bad with some poorly downscaled enemies that look like they didn't get any touchup afterwards and some garish coloring choices) so I was wondering if things could be done differently.<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ozQaYqO.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Only recolored the floor and tables so far. It's actually the master palette in itself that is way more of a constraint here in making an accurate translation compared to just the 64 color limit. The 512 color palette has some pretty distinct quirks and the main one is how lacking it is for the darker range of colors. You basically only have shades of dark blue, then some magenta and green to choose from and it ends up looking really jarring here. Perhaps shifting the whole thing to a brighter gamma style would make it more flexible.<br /><br />This is what the stage looks like in Sculptured's official port<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NmMIj6a.gif" alt="Image" />

Good work!<br />Do you plan to make a ROM patch?</div><br /><br />Nah. The art isn't 1:1 in size compared with the official port and there are more unique tiles in use for the scene so I don't think it could be shoved in the constraints of the 16mbit ROM (I guess this would be closer to a Sega CD port like Final Fight if you don't want to optimize the tile usage to fit within a sensible ROM size). Kinda funny that this port is the same size as Streets of Rage 2 yet the latter has significantly more impressive presentation in just about every regard. I guess it helps that the latter was made from the ground up with the system in mind.<br /><br />I actually remember now that there was a hack project in the works that replaced the background art in the Genesis port of Super Street Fighter 2 with new art scaled down from the arcade original at better quality (looks like in the official port some elements like the crowd were redrawn rather poorly).<br /><br />Original:<br /><img src="http://www.vizzed.com/vizzedboard/retro/user_scores/saves14/141668/GENESIS--Super%20Street%20Fighter%20II_Jun25%2015_49_12(tt1278).png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Hacked:<br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/i6rI4gg.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.sega-16.com/forum/showthread.php?28435-New-project-New-background-graphics-for-SSF2" class="postlink">Thread on Sega-16</a>
