Two layers is trivial on both SNES and MD (indeed, scrolling both layers is trivial on both SNES and MD, and your example doesn't have that).  The scaling boss is a bit large for 60 fps perhaps, but the required tileset for everything else is pretty tiny and doesn't change much, so double buffering the scaling boss should be feasible and result in a decent frame rate for the scaling/Z-axis motion (no reason why the X/Y motion shouldn't be 60 fps).  The boss is horizontally symmetric and appears to be a bit chunky at the largest scales, which means you could probably use tile flipping and line scrolling to fit it comfortably into a two-frame update on NTSC.  The use of line scroll (as well as the fact that the boss can take up basically the entire width of the screen, leaving nothing (on MD) or almost nothing (on SNES) for the HUD and squirrel) would require the boss to use a BG layer, which means the far background would have to be sprites (unless it's 2bpp, which is a great fit for Mode 1 BG3 on SNES), but that's okay because the required coverage is low, and at least on SNES the backdrop gradient is trivial with HDMA - MD would need to use a raster IRQ, but it's still feasible.<br /><br />The &quot;lighting effect&quot; looks like simple palette animation.  Trivial on both SNES and MD.<br /><br />If my calculations are correct, a modified tepples method on SNES could manage a credible scaling frame rate on that boss without having to store the graphic at all scales.  But I haven't gotten very far with this due to being busy with other stuff, so I don't have a solid grasp of the real-life speed attainable with this class of methods.  And using such a method on a BG layer is more work than using it on sprites, since you have to render slivers in absolute position rather than just sliding sprites around.  If either the HUD or the far background were 2bpp, <em>and</em> the boss were narrow enough to allow the player character to coexist without glitching, maybe using sprites for the boss would work - line scroll is fairly cheap with the tepples method, although it does have to be hard rendered and thus the DMA bandwidth requirement will increase for high zoom levels...<br /><br />Alternately, you could do what Rendering Ranger did <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqst5ruPm3M?t=1359" class="postlink">here</a>, and just use sprites for the backgrounds and Mode 7 for the boss - this method (first used in Super Mario World) might not be quite feasible for the exact content shown in your example (there are nearly-full horizontal runs of tiles in the foreground layer), but the scene is at least almost sparse enough to work.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'am curious to see an effect like this :<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://youtu.be/D3COba64xL4?t=2m54s">https://youtu.be/D3COba64xL4?t=2m54s</a><!-- m --></div><br />I'm not a 3D expert, but that doesn't look out of reach.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">or this:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://youtu.be/D3COba64xL4?t=4m">https://youtu.be/D3COba64xL4?t=4m</a><!-- m --></div><br />...yeah, that's trivial with Mode 7, and I bet Titan could figure out a way on the MD.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">psycopathicteen wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I hope somebody finds a secret register or something in the SNES.</div><br />Ah, yes, the legendary $FEED...

He just missed one of the cleanest, non low-saturation BG3s in an SNES game.<br /><br />I think it's a surprisingly solid game for something that's really only known because of its technical prowless and rarity. (Especially considering it was made by a European developer in the 90's. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />)<br /><br />My main problem with the game is that huge ass, 7 hit lifebar... It's not even that it's too lenient either; on hard and the regular number of lives, I barely beat the game. The problem is that in many areas, it's impossible not to get hit; everything just kind of files  accross the screen straight into you. It's a real shame that Stage 7, which is easily the most impressive looking in the game (especially with that phenomenal intro), is probably also the worst gameplay wise.

It's such a simple technique that it doesn't really alter the feasibility on SNES/MD.  The giant scaling graphic is the only part that's remotely challenging.<br /><br />You sounded like you were trying to portray this as something clearly beyond the capabilities of the SNES and MD.  Is this not what you were trying to say?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">mode 7 is useless here</div><br />Only for this exact scenario, and only because the foreground layer isn't quite sparse enough to avoid glitching when combined with the player, HUD, and far background if all of them have to be sprites.<br /><br />...okay, I haven't actually verified that the boss will fit in 256 tiles with no horizontal flipping (this being Mode 7, you can vertically flip the whole picture in between scanlines, so it's possible you could save some tiles on vertically symmetric features).  If not, there's a trick that allows a 128x256 4bpp Mode 7 graphic without any compression losses, or potentially even bigger and/or more colourful if the picture compresses well.  I think you could get pretty close to what's seen in your example.<br /><br />Did you watch the Rendering Ranger example?  Multiple independently-scrolling backgrounds made of sprites, combined with a Mode 7 boss (complete with palette fade-in).  Carefully designed to avoid sprite dropout.  Granted the foreground layer is eliminated before the actual fight starts, but that's probably because the player in this case can put out some fairly massive firepower, and combined with the boss' firepower it would have guaranteed glitching.  Your scenario seems to lack firepower entirely; it's just the squirrel and the machine.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">and even with precalc,i think you do not have the DMA budget for that,or you must drastically reduce the fram rate</div><br />This isn't a generic full-screen graphic being scaled.  It's a horizontally symmetric, vertically chunky full-screen graphic.  That makes a big difference.  Besides, even if you did have to drastically reduce the frame rate of the scaling (as you might if you attempted it in software), that wouldn't have to affect the frame rate of the rest of the action.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The zoom is probably done by changing the X/Y harware scrolling, the copper can do it easily,but not  at a 1 pixel precision.</div><br />Interesting.  But I was speculating about how to do it on SNES.<br /><br />With precomputed graphics it's not hard at all.  Considering how chunky the boss graphic seems to be at high zoom, along with the fact that the right side is a mirror flip of the left, I figure it probably doesn't need to be more than about 7-8 KB or so if you use a BG layer for it and repeat lines with HDMA scroll changes.  Considering not much else is happening, you could probably update the whole thing in two frames on NTSC, or one frame on PAL (which may actually be the more appropriate comparison).  The backdrop is dead simple to do with sprites; it doesn't even move, and coverage is low, but if it's only 2bpp it can be BG3.  The foreground stuff can be a normal BG layer, and the HUD can be sprites, or BG3 or a mixture of both if the far background is sprites.  The only question is storage, and you can get very fine-grained scaling in a few hundred KB with no optimization or compression, if you're willing to burn that much ROM.<br /><br />Using precomputed sprites might work too, and it would take far less ROM because a lot of the fine scaling could be accomplished by shifting sprites relative to one another.  You'd have to be super careful with sprite priority, though, to avoid massive glitching when scaling vertically - this is one scenario where the SNES has a disadvantage vs. the MD despite its slightly higher overdraw ratio, because it's the frontmost sprites that drop out, so you'd have to dynamically fiddle with sprite priority to keep the player's sprite in front of the sprites behind it, but behind the sprites beside it.  Naïvely, DMA bandwidth requirements would seem to be higher than with a BG layer because you can't stretch sprites vertically with HDMA, so the graphics for a given frame take more space, but in practice you'd have several frames to upload the required shrunken sprites because with this scheme you don't need to update the whole mess every frame.  You might actually be able to get 60 fps scaling this way.  The boss seems to be slightly wider than the screen at its widest point and closest zoom, but if you used window masking instead of opaque sprites to fill, say, the dark part of the jet intakes, you might be able to avoid glitching since there's almost nothing else onscreen.<br /><br />With a software scaling method, you have compute time to worry about (because all that crazy maneuvering in the previous paragraph is free, right?), and the tradeoffs get more complicated.  An efficient quasi-tepples method of the sort I've been considering would involve 16-bit tables, which might actually take up more space than the precomputed BG approach...  8-bit tables are way smaller but constrain the method to be somewhat slower.<br /><br />Technically it is possible to change H-scroll values during a line, and it would probably work if you used DMA.  However, there are at least two reasons why this is a bad idea, possibly three: 1) DMA stalls the CPU, which is very bad in the case of a full-screen effect, 2) DMA is two dots per byte, and the timing alignment inevitably results in a one-dot horizontal offset between scanlines, so it's actually impossible to change a register at the exact same point on all lines, and 3) there's significant lag in the PPU's uptake of scroll values, which may or may not cause unresolvable issues.  (I'd mention the 1/1/1 DMA/HDMA clash bug, but if you can pull off a timing-critical raster effect like this you can probably avoid triggering that bug in the process - in fact you can probably just forget about HDMA entirely and use DMA to do the same thing.)  So duplicating the effect as you suspect it was accomplished on the Amiga is probably not reasonable on SNES - but as I've suggested above, there are other ways that could produce good results.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The only part where I noticed there would be sprite dropout for certain if you were to use Mode7 is the scoreboard when over that weird grate thing above the starting platform. I don't think any SNES game ever went that hardcore with sprites to fake backgrounds for Mode 7 (well, Cameltry/On the Ball) but I don't see why it couldn't be done here.<br /><br /><s>Actually, you know what? You could even use Mode 7 for the entire boss other than the top narrow part that reaches the scoreboard, and have only that be prerendered. The scoreboard could then still be BG3 like it would make most sense to be &#40;it&#39;s only 2bpp&#41;.</s><br />Edit: Wait, no, this wouldn't work, because the boss really isn't tied to the screen much at all; if you fall fast enough, the scoreboard goes through the entire thing. I didn't watch it that closely...<br /><br />Interestingly, Super Turican 2 typically uses BG3 for the status bar, but will switch over to sprites for Mode 7 or if all backgrounds are needed durring those lines. This isn't even an SNES game, but I observed in MAME that Ninja Baseball Batman does the same thing during the second stage when the clouds, large blimp, and bridge use all 3 background layers, so I guess it wasn't too uncommon.

No scrolling, no palette animation/lighting...  very convincing fake BG, but it doesn't go anywhere - it's basically just like Super Mario World.  The boss isn't even that big.

I'm getting mixed messages here.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I am not saying amiga is the best machine, it's a better machine in some cases, worse in others</div><br />I agree, it's an impressive machine for its time.  And since it works very differently from the SNES (as well as being far more expensive - $1295 for an Amiga 1000 in 1985, and $595 for an Amiga 500 in 1987), it's reasonable to expect that not everything it can do will end up translating perfectly.<br /><br />But when someone shows me something like this and says it's impossible, something inside me refuses to accept the conclusion without trying to prove it wrong.  One time somebody on a different forum posited a Moon-sized object on a 40-year collision course with Earth, the idea being that there would be nothing we could do about it - rather than accept his premise and go along with the line of discussion he wanted, I started speculating about thermonuclear pulse spacecraft and world economic output, whereupon he changed it to a black hole and three days, which I thought was rather rude...
