Depending on the mapper, you can have no animation of ? blocks, yes animation of ? blocks and custom copypasted animation (like with CHR-RAM) which is slow. One fully filled CHR pattern data is 8KB. But how much is it on GBC?<br /><br />GBC has a CHR-RAM with 2 banks of 8KB in itself and I suppose that the BIOS loads the CHR pattern tables from the cartridge to that place.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">8000-9FFF&nbsp; &nbsp;8KB Video RAM (VRAM) (switchable bank 0-1 in CGB Mode)</div> &lt;- this is what it says.<br />Now, is it possible to do bankswitching where a SMB3 ? block is animated? I need to know this so I can make blocks animated or static.<br />Is it possible to have multiple enemy banks like in SMB3? If not, would copypasting from PRG-ROM to CHR-RAM be a good option? How do many Pokemon sprites in Pokemon games get loaded?<br /><br />And where do I begin drawing sprites and where the background? First 256 tiles are background or sprites?

But how much is it on GBC?</div><br />Game Boy has a total of 8 KiB of video memory. This main background nametable (1 KiB), the window nametable (1 KiB), and CHR RAM (6 KiB). The CHR RAM is divided into 2 KiB for sprites, 2 KiB shared between sprites and background, and 2 KiB for background.<br /><br />Game Boy Color has twice that. There are two 6 KiB banks of CHR RAM, and each nametable has an additional 1 KiB attribute plane telling which palette, flip, priority, and CHR bank each map space uses. See <a href="http://problemkaputt.de/pandocs.htm#videodisplay" class="postlink">pandocs: video display</a>.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I suppose that the BIOS loads the CHR pattern tables from the cartridge to that place.</div><br />Nope, you have to do that yourself like on NES games with CHR RAM or Super NES games. But it's essentially just implementing <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">memcpy&#40;&#41;</tt> unless you want to get fancy with compression. On Game Boy Color, you also have CHR HDMA (character horizontal-blank direct memory access), which copies one 16-byte tile from ROM or RAM to VRAM for each of the 144 scanlines. If you're making a GBC-exclusive game with spinning Koopature Science Floating Storage Cubes, you'll probably want to use CHR HDMA to animate them.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&quot;?&quot; blocks can always be animated, it's just the method of animation that changes depending on the hardware. Fine (1KB or 2KB) CHR-ROM bankswitching is what SMB3 uses, but a CHR-RAM game could do it by overwriting the 4 tiles (64 bytes) in the pattern table.<br /><br />Ultimately, a game could modify all instances of the animated blocks in the name tables to use other tiles. If I'm not mistaken, the NROM version of Driar does this to animate the stars.

If so, you should target PCs instead. If not, pick the platform you like that can do what you want to do in your game, and when unsure about how to implement something, take cues from existing games that prove that what you want to do is possible.<br /><br />If you're brave, you can even try things that have never been done before in a certain platform, but then you'll be on your own, since there won't be any existing solutions to study.

But as I understand the specs, there's so much available time in hblank on GBC that you don't really need vblank except for writing a new sprite display list.<br /><br />tokumaru: PC has its own constraints, such as audio latency, DLL hell potential, and needing to manually configure controllers whose <a href="https://pineight.com/mw/?title=USB_game_controller" class="postlink">button order differs</a> from that of the Xbox 360 controller.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The defining character of a &quot;modern&quot; software renderer vs an older hardware dynamic sprite engine is the limited overdraw (&amp; total sprite count). If you just want to not have to worry about it ... you're explicitly wanting to avoid the thing that makes it retro instead of &quot;retreaux&quot;.<br /><br />As far as targeting GCC &amp;// LLVM to ARM, certainly ARM is one of the modern ISAs that both actually care about. But to just say &quot;efficient&quot; is disingenuous; it implies that such a thing has a single optimal choice. it's a  hard thing to quantify, and hand-written assembly for many ISAs is often &quot;more efficient&quot;. <span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">(caveat: humans are usually worse at superscalar and SSE stuff)</span><br /><br />Minimal effort to bootstrap yourself is probably something like devkitARM.
