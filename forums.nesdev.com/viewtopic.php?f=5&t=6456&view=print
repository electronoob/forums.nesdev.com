<br />
<br />I wonder if it's still a NES game at heart running on an emulator, or some kind of port.  That's something I've been wondering about, if it would be possible to make a new NES game for Wiiware.
<br />
<br />Also I like the Back to the Future inspired art. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Of course you can make something like Mega Man 9 once you've made and sold a game on at least one non-Nintendo platform.

<br />No need, I just have to find someone who's already released a Wiiware game.  In fact I've already spoken to the people who made Gravitronix, though obviously I don't have anything to release yet.  Now Vblank Entertainment seems a more likely candidate.
<br />
<br />That's not really what I meant anyway, since Megaman 9 isn't a NES game as we've looked at in detail before.  Depending on what Nintendo allows for Wiiware, the ideal would be to write a NES emulator to run the game and package them together.

When the answer is the former, I stop playing. 
<br />
<br />If a game plays well, I don't care if it looks like an NES game, or is extremely graphically detailed.

<br />I don't know, I'm pretty confident that you could approximate Grand Theft Auto's gameplay on the NES.  Of course he might've run into difficulties with the way he was personally attempting to do it.
<br />
<br />I wonder if he ever posted here.  There's a good chance he at least looked through the forums.

<br />Unless the Wii console is hideously expensive in your country, and it's even more expensive to move out. This is the case in tokumaru's home country due to prohibitive import tariffs on consumer electronics.

<br />
<br />Import taxes also have nothing to do with whether or not the game is good. If you don't like my original statement, change play to enjoy. 
<br />
<br />Tokumaru said nothing related to this, he said it was an interesting concept for NES, but the same thing on Wii is mediocre. As if the game itself becomes less interesting on a different platform. Even if it is hideously expensive, it has nothing to do with his statement, or my statement in response.
<br />
<br />As well, I imagine import taxes would affect a cartridge game more than a wiiware game distributed online, assuming one already had the console. (Wii or NES).
