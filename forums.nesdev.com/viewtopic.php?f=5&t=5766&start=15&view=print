<br />You don't need any of that if your body can't have air and water. I didn't say life <strong>would be the same</strong> without oil and gas, it would certainly be different, but while there's water and air there will at least <strong>be</strong> life.

Easy acess to common drinkable water and comfortable toilets is a huge plus. I however really wish the humanity could deal with only renewable sources of energy, so that it can go on forever without returning to a new stone age. But I'd say a new stone age may be better than the end of all humanity - but still I wouldn't be happy about both.

<br />
<br />We would probably be better off in the long run as certain crazy organizations based in the middle east would lose there power and it would probably result on more income coming into the USA.
<br />
<br />Naturally since oil is not going to dissapear tomorrow we ain't gonna stop using huge amounts of it till we really do run out.

<br />
<br />Now as long as there will be sucky governments arround the world they will be problems. My country is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index" class="postlink">supposely</a> the 8th more democraty country in the world, and I can promise you guys its really not that much democratic at all. This makes it very frightening for the 159 countries which follows.

In fact, the question is no longer preventing harm to the biosphere or humanity itself, but reducing it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Now as long as there will be sucky governments around the world they will be problems.</div>
<br />Yes, the governments do not even take it seriously.  They care about SLOWING the GROWTH of emissions, purely as a political gesture, when, for the sake of the continuation of diverse life on this planet, carbon emissions need to be even less than they were 30-40 years ago.  Well, actually, the governments of island nations like the Maldives care about global warming, since their existence is endangered.
<br />
<br />It's not just the environment, though.  Due to the current global economy's exploitation of developing countries, most of the world's industry has a direct human cost as well.  Profit tends to win out over ideas of universal human rights and dignity.  One noteworthy example is the general dependence upon 'conflict minerals' from the Congo for the cheap production of today's gadgets.

<br />Not a pretty picture, but one that would be solvable if the international community actually cared.  But, again, they care about easy and cheap trade, and there is no real accountability.  Business is business.  It's been said that there is now more slavery in the world than ever.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  Sorry, I live in a country (United States) where a lot of people just want to keep consuming and not think about any of this.  It's frustrating...

<br />
<br />I definitely agree there. If you've seen the growth curve over time, it has literally skyrocketed in the past few centuries. And yet the far right are worried that gays will end the human race due to no more reproduction.
<br />
<br />On the "bright" side, our entire economic system, based on usury, relies on exponential growth of the population (and thus, of consumption) as well; on a planet with finite resources.
