		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been using Anomie's spc700.txt that I got from romhacking.net (I would give a more direct link, but the site seems to be down now).  Inside the doc it says:
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Operands are encoded little endian, with multiple operands stored last to first. For example, "OP A, B" is stored in memory as "OP B A". Mnemonics are represented as "OP dest, src" where applicable.<br /></div>
<br />
<br />This is the only part in the doc which makes any mention of how multiple operands are stored.  And while this appears to be true for direct page-&gt;direct page instructions (MOV $xx, $xx  and similar)... I just spent the last hour debugging my SPC emu only to find that it's NOT true for CBNE (which has the direct page address stored first)
<br />
<br />
<br />I began looking at other docs to see if they address the issue, only to find that none of them (at least none of the ones I have) even touch on this subject.
<br />
<br />So my question is... how are multiple operands REALLY stored?  If CBNE contradicted Anomie's doc.. I suspect other instructions do too (DBNZ is suspect, as are maybe BBC/BBS)... but I don't want to have to pick and guess.  Can anyone give me a definative answer?
<br />
<br />Thanks

Think of the order they're needed by the instruction, where the source is always fetched before the destination in a RMW instruction (so since dest is listed first, you get opposite order for the dp,ds addressing mode).
<br />
<br />I looked and the much updated DSP doc isn't up yet (apudsp.txt). I'll have to find out what the holdup is, as should have a ton more timing information.
<br />
<br />So, you're writing an SPC emulator. I better start posting my validation tests tomorrow; I've got tons. :)

That explains CBNE -- can't branch unless you first compare the target address.  I switched DBNZ, BBC, and BBS around as well, and everything seems to be working now.

<br />
<br />I started a SNES emu as sort of an educational project.  I'm just having so much fun ^^.
<br />
<br />I am very interested in any test ROMs you might have.  Those are invaluable!  Especially anything involving the CPU -- as that's the hardest to track down bugs in.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What form would work best for tests? I can generate any of these three easily: raw data that you put directly into the SPC memory space then execute, an SPC music file, or an SMC SNES ROM. The first two do text console I/O via the four I/O registers using a simple protocol. The SMC does this internally and provides a SNES-side driver that displays the text on screen and encodes it into serial data over one of the controller I/O lines, which you can decode using my handy Blargg_Serial emulator. You can run the SMC in a normal emulator.
<br />
<br />If it's any help I can also post my SPC emulator code, whose DSP is written in a clear style.

<br />
<br />Emu source wouldn't be all that useful to me -- at least not right now.  I already have the SPC mostly done except for the DSP (which I don't have much interest in at this point -- I'd like to get games running before I worry about audio).
<br />
<br />Thanks blargg ^^
<br />
<br />I don't suppose you have or know of a main SNES CPU test ROM?  Something like nestest would be bliss.  Wishful thinking, I know, but no harm in asking  ;D

<br />A lot of games don't block on the APU; they block on the PPU.

<br />
<br />A lot will hang if the SPC doesn't respond, yes.  However the SPC can still respond if you're not generating audio.
