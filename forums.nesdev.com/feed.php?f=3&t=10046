Yes, a wait loop should max out one core, by design.<br /><br />That's one of many problems of trying to do windowed vsync that way:<br />1. wasting CPU polling the vsync<br />2. various factors may contribute to a fixed delay between vsync and your actual video update (causes a consistent tear)<br />3. windows may interrupt your program at a critical time anyway (causing an occasional tear)<br />4. the timing of your window's actual video update can be buffered/rescheduled by the operating system (making the vsync irrelevant)<br />5. vsync may not actually correspond to a real hardware state (in some cases it is just a dummy timer)<br />6. vsync may not signal at all, causing program to fail (rare)<br /><br />All that said, sometimes you are getting a real vsync signal, and the conditions for timing are right, and you get a tear-free window. It's generally a matter of luck. Issue 1 you just have to live with if you want to use this method (and a good reason to make it optional). Issue 2 can be mitigated with a user configurable timer of some sort that inserts a delay between vsync and the video update, but this tends to be really fiddly. 3 is usually infrequent, occasionally very frequent. 4 and 5 are conditions that will make the effort entirely useless on that system. 6 is another reason it needs to be an option.<br /><br />Actually, sometimes under lucky conditions the standard DirectX/OpenGL/Windows APIs for double buffering will appear to work in a window, and you'll get no tearing without the wasted CPU cycles. This is not guaranteed or even specified behaviour, but in some situations it does produce a consistent/stable timing with a tear-free result.<br /><br /><br />I've never liked the vsync poll method, because it's an out-of-spec solution that fails to work in a lot of cases (and the CPU load is a significant problem in itself). It's possible though that the hardware/driver situation is better than it used to be and maybe it works on more systems now? My own experience is certainly not a comprehensive survey.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sat May 17, 2014 10:50 pm</p><hr />

BTW, I forgot of another emulator that seems to get windowed vsync correct (on XP) -- Fusion.  No &quot;special settings&quot;, just enable &quot;Vsync&quot; in the Video pulldown and that's it.  Though that emulator does take up 15% CPU of my i7-2600K (pretty much one core maxed out at all times, even with Sleep-while-waiting enabled), still...<br /><br />The README had this to say about it:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Please note that VSync in Windowed mode may be quite slow. This is because<br />the only way to do VSync in windowed mode is to physically sit there and<br />wait until the VSync happens. Obviously that can be a huge waste of CPU<br />time, especially if, at the point you start waiting, you've only just<br />missed the last VSync...<br /></div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Sat May 17, 2014 8:56 pm</p><hr />

It probably <em>could</em> be solved at the driver level, but that's completely outside the game programmer's control. Nobody wants to distribute thousands of hacked drivers with their game, and who would trust them enough to install them over the ones made by the manufacturer?<br /><br />That said, on the driver side, I doubt it's as simple as swap vs copy when you're dealing with a windowed environment (and a copy can be vsynced just fine by the hardware if done properly). There's a lot of ways to skin that cat.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Thu May 02, 2013 7:31 pm</p><hr />

If you fail to do this, it will be in competition with other running programs, because the OS is never given the hint that this game should be running more smoothly than the rest of the things you have running.<br /><br />There is a corollary that it is also important to lower the thread priority when it is not needed (e.g. game minimized or paused) or at least have very low CPU usage during these times so that the user can get back their CPU when they want to run other programs temporarily.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Mon Apr 29, 2013 7:04 pm</p><hr />

DOS wasn't multitasking. You could get away with just polling the vblank flag (VGA got rid of the vblank interrupt) and you would still be guaranteed that the moment it went from 0 to 1 vblank had just started.<br /><br />Even then I find it weird, because I'm pretty sure vblank should work... Stuttering comes from the fact programs don't get a vblank-based timer anymore (and if you're doing fixed framerate, there isn't much use for it since the refresh rate can be anything), the closest you can get is the rendering thread stalling when it swaps the buffers with vsync on... and only when it never misses a vblank period.<br /><br />Also reminds me, vsync doesn't work on multimonitor systems at all, because the OS insists on treating them like a single huge monitor, and the monitors aren't in sync (they may not even have the same refresh rate!). Kind of stupid, it'd make more sense to treat each monitor as a completely separate display... I guess we're stuck with this because when multimonitor support was added in Windows the concept of multiple workspaces was uncommon (also probably because programs were never made for multiple displays and there could have been something misbehaving horribly - remember Windows' backwards compatibility history).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4526">Sik</a> — Mon Apr 29, 2013 1:43 pm</p><hr />

I know it bugs me. Especially since these problems were ironed out in the DOS days. Why should it be so difficult now? VSync should be an easily accessible feature in any OS/software environment that might be used to make a game, and it shouldn't cause unnecessary stutter.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4871">snarfblam</a> — Sun Apr 28, 2013 5:43 pm</p><hr />
