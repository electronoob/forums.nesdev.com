		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Memblers, do you remember the docs that you link to me??
<br />
<br />i think that any little parts are inaccurate:
<br />
<br />Switchstance wrote it in a doc:
<br />
<br />He says: "En los cartuchos con 32KB la informacion se encontraba en circuitos especiales adheridos llamados Mappers."
<br />
<br />It's meaning: "Catridges that  use 32 kb of PRG-ROM must using MMC. "
<br />
<br />lord_Chile: I think that games with MORE THAN 32kb of PRG-ROM use mappers. He says that games with just 32kb of prg rom use mappers!!, but smb1 is mapper 0 and it uses 32kb of prg-rom!!!... 
<br />
<br />then because im novice my question is: is correct that games with exactly 32 kb of prg rom use a mapper???? (in think that it's inaccurate) 
<br />
<br />or just im correct that games ONLY WITH MORE THAN 32kb prg use  a mapper????
<br />
<br />yeah, just im checking all the docs in order to get something 100% accurate, anyway swichstance made a really excellent work!
<br />
<br />good luck, and if is a error when i say that games with only 32kb arent using a mapper... dont say fool to me hahahaahah im only a newbie.
<br />
<br />
<br />Another question:
<br />
<br />swicht says: "More great game in size of official Nintendo was Kirby's Adventure, it was 6 Megabytes in size"... i think that it's inaccurate because kirby was 6 Megabits not Megabyte.. 
<br />
<br />and 8 megabit= 1 megabyte.. 
<br />
<br />then kirby was 6megabit = around 700 kb, near to 1mb.. 
<br />
<br />am i correct??

<br />
<br />Yes, <em>Kirby's Adventure</em> (one of the top 3 NES/Famicom games in PRG/CHR size) is 6 megabits.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The NES itself accepts only 48 KB (minus 24 bytes) of PRG and 8 KB of CHR. Anything more is bankswitching, which is limited only by the cost of replication. It's not the NES hardware that wouldn't accept more than 8 megabits; it's the pocketbooks of consumers during the NES era that wouldn't accept more than 50 USD. Nowadays, as the price of ROM has fallen, you can replicate 256 megabits for under 30 USD, as seen on Game Boy Advance.

<br />
<br />Are you sure that's its meaning? It's exact translation looks like:
<br />
<br />In the cartridges with 32kb of information one can find in special circuits something(to stick on?) so called mappers.
<br />
<br />I obviously don't know what the word something means. I have been taking spanish for not too long, but I suppose you're right, having known spanish for how ever many years. But is that at all close to the exact translation of that sentence? But I am having trouble with the adheridos part, please correct me on whatever may be incorrect?

<br />but anyway he says that games with 32kb of prg use mappers.. anyway i get good response

<br />
<br />i know that people to learn need exact translation, but for interpreting language, you will not need very much vocabulary.. just my english vocabulary is short... but i get interesting combinations of words.. then it is not very notorious that my vocabulary is short...

I know like clothing, polite phrases, physical appearance features, describing personality, colors, I can't remember what else I know. Haha, that doesn't make too much sense. But I guess I know like 200 words or something like that. I mean, I know important sentence structure and stuff, so I can just look up some words, and I can tell what some mean, because they are very similiar to the english. Like the spanish word for circuit, was easy to tell. And information is really easy to tell. It's not a hard language to learn, though.
