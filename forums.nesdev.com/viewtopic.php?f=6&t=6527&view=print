Allot of thee covers I've done on the N106 sound noticeably different just between Nintendulator and Nestopia, which has caused me to try and write to find a middle ground intended sound between like 6 someodd emulators.
<br />
<br />While I realize accuracy with that chip is really a pipe dream (as I guess the real thing is glob-top,) has anyone who has done the loopy edit and listened to something I put into nsf format noticed any really big differences or glitches?

<br />Even with the PowerPak it's still just emulation. Only a cart with the actual mapper should be able to give you the final answer.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Isn't the N106 just a wavetable synth? Seems strange then that the result would come out noticably different in different emulators (if their DPCM output sound alike). I can understand why that could happen with a more complex chip like the one on the VRC7.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I don't get why it would sound different either.  I guess it has to do with the DAC and mixing on the cart?  As for the VRC7, it also is 100% digital, though it's more complex it's also pretty well understood (unless there is an LFSR in there that isn't 100% figured out, I don't know, I'm pretty sure the built-in instruments were extracted though).
<br />
<br />Also, BTW I guess it's not much help but there is a version of the N106 chip that isn't a gloptop.  I've seen a picture of it on a Japanese site, I'm pretty sure it's not as common though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well pretty much everything is 100% digital. I guess sound is harder to emulate accurately, because it is much more likely there is an error no human ear can tell than with graphics for example. (if the image isn't like the real HW image you notice it, but if the sound is slightly different you don't).
<br />
<br />It's a shame so much (all ?) N106 carts are epoxy blobs, because if you ask me, it's ex-echo with MMC5 the "ultimate" mapper. It has PRG and CHR switching with fine granularly, support dual CHRROM+CHRRAM carts, battery backup, CPU-cycle based IRQ counter and has <em>overkill</em> extra sound. If the NES had to have only one mapper it'd be without a doubt either this one or the MMC5 I don't know.
<br />
<br />I'd still miss the scanline-based counter, multiplier, EX-RAM and crazy amount of SRAM supported by the MMC5.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the N106 is well-understood. Two likely reasons why emulators might differ: the relative volume of the N106 to the APU isn't well-documented, and the N106 generates significant high-frequency harmonics that stress an emulator's low-pass filter. If an emulator doesn't use a low-pass filter that attenuates strongly above the Nyquist limit, the aliasing will muddy the sound. This won't be noticed as much with the APU, since it doesn't have as rich waveforms.

For example, entering 3 will enable P, Q and R only. Entering 8 will enable all of its channels: P through W.</div>
<br />
<br />I'm sure there should be some example files around somewhere.  When I made my Squeedo cartridge originally, that's how I tested the sound synth, by hacking PPMCK and replacing the N106 channels.

<br />Doommaster, you need to call the patch using @@, NOT @N, even though you DO define it as @N. It's rather silly.
