		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It is a free scrolling limited to 8 pixels vertically. ora #$80 to move start of scrolling area to certain row, because it has stat bar above. And #7 there is because in Drag's table other bits marked as unused, why would I write garbage there?
<br />
<br />I'm glad that it works for other people on consoles etc, but it does not work for me on HW which I don't have, and it works in all the emulators, so I can't see the problem to fix it. So I need help.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">just make sure that the final writes happen during HBlank for a clean split.</div>
<br />What exactly 'clean' means? What happens if these writes aren't in HBlank time, is scroll still works, but with some garbage on the split line, or it does not work properly?

<br />PPU(palletes for example) can be updated only while Vbalnk(NMI),When PPU is turned off and during Hblank(When no pixel is rendered).
<br />Scrolling will work propely, but with garbage.

<br />Just garbage on the split line, with a possible jitter of 1 scanline. Could you share more of the code you're using? I want to help you get this right, but I really don't know enough. The limitations on the scroll values you mentioned before really threw me off.
<br />
<br />What are you using for timing? Are you using timed code, IRQs, sprite 0 hit, what? You have to make sure that the split code runs at the same time every frame, so it's important that your timing method is flawless.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I solved the problem for this project by omiting vertical scroll because lack of time. However, I still would like to figure out what was wrong.
<br />
<br />Vertical scroll was needed for screen shake effect, thus vertical range is very limited (it was actually just 0 and 1). Screen split done with sprite 0.
<br />
<br />There is no additional related code, just this. It was replaced with this code (works on HW, no vertical scroll anymore):
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;lda &lt;GAME_CAM_X+1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;and #1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ora &lt;GAME_CHR_ANIM ;%100nn000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta PPU_CTRL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda &lt;GAME_CAM_X<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta PPU_SCROLL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta PPU_SCROLL</div>
<br />
<br />I'll publish full source later.
