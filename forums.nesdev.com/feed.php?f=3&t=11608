@Myask - That's the point I was making. For your average user, the FCEUX port is complete enough. It's those extra features that are actually pretty niche even as far as emulation goes (TAS and debugging). Most people involved in emulation just want to play games (myself included as it regards the NES).<br /><br />But you missed the other point I was making. There's nothing, to my knowledge, that prevents those features from being added to the SDL/GTK+ version. Most of the debugger is probably just a matter of writing the necessary GUI code (again, as in the cases of other emulators such as VBA-M and Desmume). Video recording may be trickier (dumping audio in SDL is straightforward) but not impossible (just hit up ffmpeg if need be). I doubt there's a lot that can't be ported (or much of anything really). It's just a matter of not enough people caring to get the work done, not that the work can't be done.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6368">Shonumi</a> — Thu Sep 11, 2014 6:07 pm</p><hr />

Only a handful of Mednafen's cores are actually original (and some of the code for a few was based on existing code/designs, whatever the truly means). NES emulation is provided by FCEU, though I'm not entirely sure which version it currently uses. It's probably not hardware-accurate, but &quot;accurate&quot; enough as far as ordinary users care about, else I think they'd be hard pressed to use something better, or make something better.<br /><br />About FCEUX not truly being multiplatform, it's been ages since I even touched the Windows version, but aside from the missing debugger, I can't think of any major features that are lacking, at least none that are deal-breakers for an average player like myself. There probably are some advanced bells and whistles that I've never touched (please point them out, since I'm really curious to find out the Windows/Linux differences), but I'm guessing FCEUX is in the same boat as VBA-M and Desmume. They have Linux ports to be sure (I use them, a lot :p) but they're missing a lot of the debugging features present on the Windows version. To my knowledge, this is simply due to the fact that no one has bothered to add things to the Linux GUIs. It often gets put on the back-burner, which means indefinite delay.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6368">Shonumi</a> — Wed Sep 10, 2014 9:24 pm</p><hr />

Like I always say, running a large number of games is not a sign of accuracy. Commercial games (and newer homebrew games) are finished programs, which have been tested and bug fixed for release. This means that they are (usually) well behaved programs, that do most of their work according to the book, so a higher level simulation of the system is often enough to support them well. Things are very different during the development of a new game: you'll find yourself writing to wrong memory locations, extrapolating VBlank time, forgetting to initialize registers... and that's when accuracy is really needed, otherwise those problems might go undetected if the emulator is too forgiving with the little details.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Sep 09, 2014 3:55 pm</p><hr />

Which is the Most Accurate NES Emulator?<br />Not an easy question to answer. All the latest emulators tend to be very accurate, but I can highlight a few:<br />-- Nestopia<br />Can run almost any game. However it is not the best emulator in terms of accuracy. It has problems with IRQ processing, audio processing, DMA, video processing, PPU/CPU sync.<br />-- Nintendulator<br />Was really a revelation for me. It is written in C++ and the source code is really straight-forward, almost like asm. From that I could really see that the author understands very well how NES operates internally (it matches my vision in most details at least). However, it has a lot of inaccuracies too (IRQ processing, unofficial opcodes, audio processing, DMA, PPU/CPU sync). But it has a very good PPU, I must give a credit for that.<br />-- puNES<br />Has a closed source code, thats too bad. But it is the most accurate emulator I know, especially when it comes to APU. There is still work left to improve PPU and maybe to implement some missing details for the variants of NES (NES PAL, NES NTSC, FC, Dendy, other clones).<br />-- FCEUX<br />Does not have a good accuracy, but is very useful for debugging and stuff.<br /><br />I did not research this closely, but it can give you some ideas.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5897">x0000</a> — Tue Sep 09, 2014 12:00 pm</p><hr />
