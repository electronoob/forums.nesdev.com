The delay is whatever the propagation delay is through the buffers, but is still probably less then the MMC3's propagation delay.  Might want to try it with your A13 issue as well.  Just delay A13 and /A13 to your chip select logic. <br /><br />Also, the kind of delay you mentioned by using the PowerPak's clock isn't a good idea and generally frowned upon since the PowerPak's clock isn't related to the PPU clock.

I've played a few games now and beat them without any noticeable issues (no cheating with save states either, just a way to &quot;pick up where I left off&quot; between days <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />). I even have my 10 and 11 year old watching and helping me with the original Zelda right now, the game apparently still holds up enough to keep their interest. Now I just need to remember how to get through the lost woods without looking it up <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For the A12 buffer circuit, a really simple debounce logic I use is to feed the input into a synchronous shift register and then take your output signal as the reduction-AND of all of the bits in the shift register.  Then, you only get an output high when the input has remained high for that many consecutive clock cycles.  Then all you have to do is adjust the size of the shift register until you get the result you want.  More bits = more consistent, but more delay.  At 20MHz, you may also need a clock divider on it, or else you'd need a really large number of bits in the shift register.  It's simple, and it works.

It's simple, and it works.</div><br />Like I said earlier, this kind of implementation can never match the original MMC3 behavior, because on the real MMC3 the IRQ is triggered directly on the rising edge of A12 (with a very minor delay). Such implementation might still be close enough to be usable, but some games won't like it (Mickey's Adventures in Numberland, for example, requires very precise IRQ timing).
