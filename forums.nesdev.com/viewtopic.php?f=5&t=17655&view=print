There is what looks like RF input and usually we connect the antena for the digital signal but for an old famicom, nothing was shown. It I use my av famicom there is no issue.I remember that an old LCD TV had no issue with it though.  <br /><br />It is something common in the state too?  I make as the maker of the TV out of curiosity since I would like to use my old famicom instead of the AV one when testing dev carts.

That said, the output I use here (Canada) works in Japan as well. So I'm kind of confused why it would be any different for TV. Pal and NTSC is definitely a thing though and it makes no sense why it's like that. Why have the same power i / o but different system completely. (Hippie voice) Unify maaaaaaan!

The TV was bought a few years after Japan became all digital in 2011 (there was a delay because of the big earthquake but only for specific regions).<br /><br />The TV we borrowed at first was pre-2011 and there was no issue with it. For now I rarely use them and the one with RCA jacks are fine but I will need to find a solution someday.<br /><br />Thank you for confirming my doubts.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm sorry for the double post but I thought that creating a new thread just to ask about modulator(?) was not appropriate in that case.<br /><br />I remember when we were kids, the cheapest way was to use a vhs and just use that as intermediary to convert the signal and it was more than enough, especially with a not so great tv. Now that TV sets became better, if I buy a modulator, I guess I should go for one that goes directly from rf/rca to HDMI instead of a simple one that could convert from rf to rca?  <br /><br />I still need to do research on the subject but the first one I found seemed huge and expensive for something that doesn't do much and the same thing found on amazon us was 3 time the price on Japanese site (I guess they just imported it from the us). In that case, it may be better to look for something sold locally (from io-data, buffalo, elecom etc or similar japanese brands).<br /><br />What are people experience with modulators? I think that was maybe thread about it (?).

I am surprised to hear they still made them.<br /><br />No big loss anyway, I'm not sure why anyone would want that travesty.<br />Potentially losing 15khz altogether (via composite, or even worse, RGB) is much worse. But considering how terrible modern TVs are at upscaling those signals already, it's practically already happened when it comes to the goal of playing video games.

(Thank you!)</div><br /><br />None of this really applies to the real world. No one is buying monitors to avoid this fee. The TV license fee you're thinking of (which is NOT a tax in any countries I know of, which is another big issue) doesn't apply to being able to receive RF signals anymore, and hasn't since like the 80s. Any way you are able to receive the covered TV channels applies, which of course includes the digital tuners, but also cable services, etc.<br />Essentially if you own any single devices with the ability to go online (like, say, a phone), you need to pay. Basically, if you breathe, you need to pay.

The US does that for its fraction of public media funding, which comes through Corporation for Public Broadcasting as well as subject matter agencies such as National Science Foundation and National Endownment for the Arts.
