Tetris seems to leave the game always in 4K banks + 1screenA mirroring. SEROM doesn't support PRG banking, so that's easy.<br />Looking through the disassembly, I've seen only the following CHR layouts: 0,0; 3,3; 2,2; 3,2. Yes, I never see page 1.<br />It looks like it would have been trivial to use CNROM with the PPUCTRL register instead. It never scrolls, so it's not like the &quot;using 1-screen mirroring&quot; was useful.

The winner of the anything goes category last year was the <em>Super Bat Puncher</em> demo, which used SNROM for PRG RAM.</div>My point is one or two entries in this category don't necessitate a separate competition and prize payout.  SNROM is actually a pretty good choice for a 'greater than discrete' mapper that comes close to the capabilities of the multi-discrete mapper.  Support for 4KB CHR banks is free and trivial to add, we could toss it in there if we deemed worthwhile.  PRG-RAM is already supported if we want to splurge the dollar and change to add it to the board.  In the event miau decided to submit a sequel or more complete version into the 'anything goes' category it's within reason for us to build support if we can port him from SNROM to a more advanced multi-discrete.  IIRC we didn't have prize payouts for the 'everything else' category last time.  My suggestion isn't far from that, allow people to submit anything and everything if they please.  The public can vote and we could award non-cash prizes for the category if it gains some approval and/or is able to be added into the next cartridge volume.  In the event something like Super Bat Puncher were to get submitted we can make the call whether it's worth jumping through the hoops to include it in the multi-cart.  SBP is something I'd vote is worthy of being the 'feature game' of the volume especially with a little more content.  But since it would be in the 'anything goes' category of submissions there wouldn't be guaranteed inclusion in the multi-cart.<br /><br />How about this along with some TBD definition of 'horable entry':<br /><ul><li><strong>Main <span style="text-decoration: underline">competition:</span> 48KB or less (excluding RAM), supported by current mapper 28.</strong>  Cash prizes, special edition carts for all 'honorable entries'.  All honorable entries included on cartridge.</li><li><strong>App <span style="text-decoration: underline">experimental competition:</span> supported by current mapper 28</strong> No cash prizes. special edition cart and bonus gift along the lines of SNES mouse and adapter to top 3 entries.  If this category gains popularity we can entertain the idea of small cash prizes for future compos.  All entries included in cartridge.</li><li><strong>Anything goes <span style="text-decoration: underline">non-competition:</span></strong> <strong>Wild west of the NES/FC</strong>, submit anything you'd like, prior work, WIP, expansion on prior entry, unsupported mappers, adult content, etc.  Open voting to include it in the cartridge if possible.  Honorable entries get special edition cartridge.  Main goal here is to allow people to get appreciation for their work and submit any work they'd like to see included on the multicart.  This is not a competition and not subject to any rules.</li></ul><br />As for collaboration, I think it should always be welcome.  Although collaborators get to figure out how to handle splitting the prize(s).<br /><br />I'm curious where the 4KB suggested limit comes from on the App submission.  Probably a good limit, but don't want to be too restrictive to the point where we limit creativity.  If the app can be made significantly better by allowing 8-16KB or even the full 48KB, I'd suggest we allow for the improvement.  Since we're starting with a clean slate for each volume, I think we can afford the room.  This is the 'windows' type applications idea correct?  That and things like the 'toys' from volume 1, would fit into this type of category IMO.  How big are those?

I'll estimate their sizes from Zap Ruder's map file.<br /><ul><li>Axe: 2471 bytes (not counting CHR) </li><li>Zapper Calibration: 2612 bytes (not all actually used; only one screen is accessible from the A53 menu) </li><li>Music engine (shared with ZapPing): 1420 bytes </li><li>Controller and Zapper reading (shared with ZapPing): 489 bytes </li></ul><br />Russian Roulette on the multicart is a subroutine inside Concentration Room. The standalone version of Russian Roulette is 1536 bytes of PRG plus an ASCII font according to my hex editor.<br /><br />TapeDump occupies $8000-$941F, $E000-$ECFF, and CHR ROM.

A game designed for UNROM that uses only banks 0, 1, and 3 can have an NROM-128 game's PRG ROM stored in the unused bank. I guess expanding to 64K and adding &quot;value for size&quot; as a judging criterion might be valid, in order to discourage gross wastes of space.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also, can we clarify whether entries may be submitted that are aware of and leverage the features of mapper 28?</div><br />Which &quot;features&quot; might these be, other than switchable H/V/1 mirroring? The biggest danger here is that incorrect writes might cause a game to execute incorrectly depending on its starting bank.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'll put my thoughts out here.  Regarding the &quot;apps&quot; idea, I like Tepples idea of having a shared Music Engine/controller reading/etc and it makes a lot of sense.  However if we treat it as a competition, then this idea doesn't work quite as well.  I personally would rather see people concentrate on the &quot;main&quot; competition, and maybe they would.  It would just be a bit silly to have 10 entries in the &quot;apps&quot; category and only a few in the &quot;main&quot; category.  Last competition we extended the deadline since there were only a few submissions (which I don't foresee happening again).  <br /><br />So my question is, do we make the &quot;apps&quot; a competition, or just a community project/collaboration?<br /><br />As for other categories, we need to reach a consensus. I think it really boils down to what will work best for the hardware/software?<br /><br />Anything goes/free-for-all:  Super Bat Puncher really stands out from the last competition. If we keep the same rule that you can submit entries you are already working on, then there could be some rather impressive submissions (judging by some of the WIP stuff posted in the PROJECTS section).  Good points have been raised, it's the selling of the cartridges that ensures future contests and exposure to the NES homebrew scene. We would LIKE people to submit something that can go on the multicart. However, the whole idea behind the competition was just to get people out coding and finish something.  Nintendoage has a lot of homebrewers that don't hang out here, so they probably didn't vote on this poll. I can pretty much guarantee there will be more than 6 entries.<br /><br />In summary:<br /><br />Apps - contest or collab?<br />Multicart destined category - Definitely a go, nail down the details.<br />Anything goes - Honorable mentions receive carts, and possibly on the multicart?

I'm writing my design doc (finally got some inspiration <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ) and the humor is coming out PG-13. Nothing obscene, but things I wouldn't want my five-year-old to repeat.

I don't think it matters as much on the compo submission as it does on the multicart.  That's pretty much how it went down last time.  Slappin B* was renamed for the cart, and the nudie girl game wasn't considered for inclusion in the cart however it was accepted as a compo submission.<br /><br />As for the categories the discussions thus far have all been along the lines of the main 3.  The exact rules of each category are what is still up in the air.<br /><br />Here's my proposition for the final categories:<br /><ul><li>Main compo: max ROM 64KB, compatible with current mapper28 (no PRG-RAM).</li><li>App compo: max ROM 8KB, compatible with current mapper28.</li><li>Anything goes: wild west of NES/FC, everything accepted.</li></ul><br />Sounds like that works for everyone that's chimed in, I agree with qbradq about decision by committee.  We've had a few mentions of finer details like of judging criteria, prizes, registration, specific rules of each category.  So everyone's had a chance to chime in and voice their opinion.

Now the only reference in it is to the Bio Force Ape fake prototype thread, and I think the effect is roughly the same if you're not familiar with the source material.<br /><br />After the first post I thought it would be a shame to work on a game and not be able to share all of it with my son.
