It<br />is unsure what you will get when reading CHR via $2007.<br /><br />When in 8x8 sprite mode, only one set is used for both BG and sprites.  Either 'A' or 'B', depending on which<br />set is written to last.  If 'B' is used, $1000-1FFF always mirrors $0000-0FFF (making the 'B' set pretty<br />worthless with 8x8 sprites)</div>

<br />
<br />Are you worried about true accuracy of when which CHR set should be mapped in, incase some game were to read CHRROM? I don't think any game does but if you are concerned about accuracy I imagine the switch would happen at certain PPU clocks.
<br />
<br />In my emulator when emulating MMC5 and 8x16 sprites, I just swap the sets when drawing my sprites and swap them back afterwards or something like that. Nothing fancy and it works fine.

<br />
<br />- How do you do exactly this timing? By every scanline, pixel...? 
<br />
<br />- Actually, I'm working in this thing. My bg/spr render fetches directly from mmc5 banks, instead of "normal" ppu chr fetching. Still writing it... let's see.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />- I still can't understand how this is possible. I mean, about caching tiles to be rendered/used later. Does the NES use some tile caching? I only read "pre-fetch" tons of times, but the only real caching I know is the sprite OAM, buffering 8 per scanline AFAIK. 
<br />
<br />- So, perhaps buggy, but my emu renders frames in real time, fetching palettes, tiles and scroll values all in real time execution. If there's CHR data on PPU bus, it's fetched. I really have no clue about pre-fetches, or how this heck is "pre-stored" in the NES, anyway... -_-;;
<br />
<br />- Well, regarding the MMC5 CHR thing, I created 2 arrays of 8 pointers for separated banks. The background rendering always fetch data from specific pointers; the sprites too, from another region. ^_^;; Yup, I didn't test yet, just finishing this mess... but an idea anyway.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As others have mentioned, your sprite rendering is Doing It Wrong if you're having issues with when the switch is supposed to be.
<br />
<br />When fetching the 8 tiles for the sprites during hblank, you use the A regs for 8x16. Anything else, you use the B regs. The two get accessed at completely different times, so there's no particular issues.
<br />
<br />As for how it is possible in reality, the MMC5 has a pretty solid grasp of what the PPU is doing at any particular time (it has to, for the EXRAM effects) so it just knows when to apply the remapping.

<br />
<br />- I'm trying to ask <strong>how does the ppu keep the gfx banks until the sprites are rendered during the next scanline, or cycles 0~255?</strong> I know it fetches the <strong>tile index</strong>, since the rendering reads gfx data from pointers, and changing them will affect the rendering, no doubt.
<br />
<br />- Hard?

In the 2C02 Technical Reference, these are referred to as Memory Fetch Phase 129 through 160.
<br />
<br />When rendering the visible portion of the line, it combines the data fetched during hblank for the sprites with the data fetched on the fly for the background. Given that layout, the MMC5 only has to switch the CHR banks twice: once at the beginning of hblank, over to the sprite banks, and once at the end of hblank, back to the BG banks.
