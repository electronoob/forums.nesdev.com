The Famicom Disk System has registers at $4000-$47FF, the other "special" region.

The cartridge's high address lines pass through a multiplexer that lets me substitute the range 4000-47FF or 4800-4FFF to the cartridge while the CPU may be accessing the BIOS or port chip.<br /><br />To switch between the two areas, you toggle one of the bits on 4016.  I believe it's bit 1.  This bit basically "flows through" to A11.  Thus,  A11 will be forced high or low going to the cartridge.<br /><br />I tried to make some autodetect code, but it didn't work too hot.  I think remnants of it still inhabit the BIOS.  You could dump FDS or N106 by switching 4016 in the dumper plugin, and by using a special cartridge adaptor I made.<br /><br />Seems that some cheap carts (sachen carts, and a few pirate carts) actually crash the bus due to slow ROMs or something-  plugging in most any Sachen game will result in CopyNES not booting.

Rotating media is definitely not my strong suit.   <br /><br />AFAIK CopyNES defaults to 4800-4FFF being the emitted address, so FDS dumping should be possible natively without doing the resistors in the adaptor trick, and yes it takes a mighty big chain of adaptors to use it!  It *does* work though since I have played it through three adaptors chained together.  I had to remove the RAM pack from the case though since the damn case was too big still.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=230">kevtris</a> — Fri Oct 06, 2006 11:44 pm</p><hr />

I have an MGD1, which I haven't tested for FDS dumping yet, and FDSLoadr, which generally works well, but leaves a lot to be desired (ability to dump non standard format disks like Bung or dev disks, and better error reporting).

As I understand, CopyNES can handle either FDS <strong>or</strong> Namco 106 stuff, not both - the reason is that when the BIOS is enabled, the rest of the system sees accesses to $4000-$47FF or $4800-$4FFF, depending on a software (or hardware?) setting, and if something else is actually residing at said memory range, reading the BIOS ROM will result in a bus conflict and crash the machine.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7">Quietust</a> — Wed Sep 27, 2006 10:04 am</p><hr />

I'm currently trying to back up some white Sunsoft dev disks for FDS (19 of them...borrowed from DreamTR), and FDSLoadr isn't the best tool for these particular disks.  I mean it dumps some of them pretty well, but I think  a lot of these disks are not in standard FDS format, so FDSLoadr has trouble with them.  Some disks have missing or bad blocks, but I have no way of knowing exactly what's wrong with them.<br /><br />Anyone know how CopyNES does with dumping FDS games?  I heard it was theoretically possible, but it would be great to have a far better tool than FDSLoadr for this.  FDS is a very overlooked side of the dumping/preservation scene, even though it is in need of preservation far more than carts.<br /><br />-Rob<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=200">rbudrick</a> — Wed Sep 27, 2006 7:32 am</p><hr />
