		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a willem programmer and I was going to use the AM29F032 chips with the TSOP40B boards. I accidently purchased the wrong chips (I purchased MBM29F033C-70PTN.) I have ordered the correct chips but was wondering if these chips could be programmed using a Willem. The pin outs look the same for both set up chips. I have tried a few different &quot;devices&quot; on the Willem software but I always seem to get this error message &quot;0x000005 chip = 0xFF buffer 0x97&quot; Sometimes the numbers are different like it might say &quot;0x000001 chip = 0xFF buffer 0x85&quot; or something along those lines. Any help with this would be appericated. Also today when I started messing around with it, it will not ID the chips (I never changed the position from yesterday.) and when I plug in an external power supply it starts to get really hot.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Be sure your power supply is the correct polarity (the LED will light up regardless! what a stupid idea to not have it inform you of issues), and that the jumpers are configured properly to 1) tell the willem to use external power (some need this) and 2) select the correct VPP. Documentation is shit for these devices, but I remember coming across helpful jumper diagrams a while ago with some tough googling. <br /><br />I am fairly sure the error here is that it is trying to write 0x97 from the buffer to the chip, but after attempting to do so it is reporting that the chip remains at the (blank) 0xFF, and that single write was unsuccessful. I am sure some others could shed more specific light on this topic, but 99% of the time problems I have had were from power supply configuration issues.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the reply, I thought I read that the external power supply could be 9V or 12V. I am currently using a Genesis 1 AC adapter with it. I think I have all the VPP/VCC settings correct but would have to find diagrams to confirm probably.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Are you sure the willem uses a Genesis 1 center negative DC power supply? The USB GQ's use a center positive power supply. If the willem uses an AC input, then polarity doesn't matter, the Genesis 1 power supply should work just fine with it.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I thought so as well, mostly from how the LED lights up anyway, but on mine the center was positive going to the input pin of the 7805, while the center pin went to the barrel. It's possible that a genesis adapter may be damaging it? I'm still not sure if the 7805 is used at all times / at all, it's all so poorly documented such that I'm not really sure what is going on. If I had my EPROM stuff with me, I'd pull out the adapter I rigged up that worked fine. I am pretty certain that I used standard center-positive polarity for it.
