Most NES games does have neraly no text, so playing them in english or japanese is okay.<br />Only 1% of NES games have enough text to be mattered, including the very best ones (Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest), but that still is only 1% of NES games.<br /><br />PS : I really don't know how you guy could be so interesed about japanese and chinese languages.

Take a typical NES game with 256 KiB PRG ROM and 128 KiB CHR ROM. Add an 8 KiB CHR RAM and double the PRG size. Then whenever a character speaks, the engine can copy kanji glyphs from PRG ROM into CHR RAM.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Jun 05, 2006 4:23 pm</p><hr />

I personally didn't know China played much NES, or had one for that matter. I thought that there wouldn't be enough space for the kanji in the pattern tables. Are there not many RPGs for the FC in China? I can't imagine they have many. Maybe I'm just assuming too much, I don't really know anything about chinese. I'm learning japanese though, and I've learned a little about chinese through learning about japanese.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Mon Jun 05, 2006 2:10 pm</p><hr />

So the only way to get a good job here is to go to high scool or university to work in reshearch and developpement, and work in big entreprises. But by doing so, you do nothing but enlarge the difference between the big entreprises and small ones, make technology progress, exploit more the chineese constructors and polluting more the planet.

Try not to worry too much about the words people use.  Many of us also call all tissue paper "Kleenex" even if it's a different brand.  Strange things happen in language sometimes.  It's human nature.  If we try to force ourselves to use different words, it feels unnatural and we laugh.  Many of us have already been lectured about Taiwan several times by visiting Chinese students, even though we understand it very well in a nuanced way.  People who go into politics begin using their government's recommended terminology quickly, but other people just want to be natural and have friendly conversations.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=278">augnober</a> — Mon Jun 05, 2006 3:17 am</p><hr />

I'm really surprised how popular the NESdev China board is frequented, and how many chineese people are using it right after it was founded. I know that  a lot of reverse-engineering has been done in China and Taiwan, but I didn't know they still care about the NES/Famicom today. Looks like it had been a good idea to open the board.<br />For some reason everything that have to do with reverse-engineering, emulation, piracy, is all about China and/or Taiwan. I'm unsure why, since I know nothing about those countries. I've heard that they are just full of people working incredibly hard since the age of 8 for an incredibly low salary, wich is kind of sad. Almost all electronics are made in the industry in those countries, just because it is cheaper. Again, I do fell like knowing nothing about China, so exange more knowlege on the net can only be good.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Jun 05, 2006 1:22 am</p><hr />

Now that there's a Chinese area, perhaps we can try to help make some of the information here more accessible to the new Chinese users.  So the first thing I wanted to do was skim through the wiki and post a bit of the essential information in Chinese.<br /><br />That's when I got reminded that I can't access <a href="http://nesdevwiki.ath.cx/" class="postlink">http://nesdevwiki.ath.cx/</a>.  I should also mention that I can't access Quietust's Nintendulator site (which shares the domain ath.cx).  It has been this way as long as I can remember, so it's probably a widespread issue (ie. ath.cx is inaccessible for many, if not all, users in China).  Perhaps someone can find a different host for it, or a temporary mirror.<br /><br />Edit: I've noticed now that <a href="http://nesdev.com/" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/</a> has a lot of nice links and actual documents online.  No faq or wiki there though.  Upon trying to find out what ath.cx is, it seems it's a dynamic dns service.. which may not be good anyway because it tends to be one of the least accessible kinds of things (in terms of workplaces, schools, etc.).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=278">augnober</a> — Fri Jun 02, 2006 12:55 am</p><hr />
