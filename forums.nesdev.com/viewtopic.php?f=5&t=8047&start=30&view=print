<br />In fact the FDS vibrato can act in the audible range, it's frequency registers is identical to the main frequency register so you can even vibrato faster than the tone itself. However you can't change it in real time during the playback of the note, which is why it's wrong to call it FM synthesis.
<br />
<br />Back to the top 100, I'm surprised that Zelda 2 and SMB2 scores so high. Personally I wouldn't think they deserves to be on a list, or maybe just for the "I am error" quote but hell this doesn't make it a good game. Anyway this is down to personal taste.

The dragon warrior style map movement with crap graphics and then side screen gameplay with cheap enemies was total crap, any other game and it'd of been voted "worst NES game ever" but it was Zelda, so it was perfect I guess.

<br />
<br />While I agree that Zelda 2 is (by far) one of the series weakest entries (ONE of -- let us not forget the CD-i Zelda games! Bwahahaha!!), it wasn't THAT hard. At least, once you spend enough time in the world map grinding until you got Link up to Level 8. The process of grinding though was horrendous. Imagine killing score after score of slimes to get to Level 8 -- it takes days (I can attest to this -- my insane self actually did this back when the game was new).
<br />
<br />But yeah... overrated due to the name on the box.

<br />
<br />I never needed to grind in Zelda 2 anyway.  The game intends you do to Level 1 early, because all the enemies there give enough points to give you all your early level ups.  Otherwise, it's a slaughter in your favor, but you barely get enough points to level up.  The game can be hard if you decide to do "Hammer before Level 1".  Who needs candles?

<br />
<br />The only place anyone should be grinding is on tektites at the main town across the ocean.  You kill a few with fireballs, head into town for free healing and magic recharge, head back out, etc.  Pretty dang quick leveling, even though you need to use magic to do it.
<br />
<br />And then it gets too hard again in the very last dungeon, but a good majority of the game is incredibly easy.

This is not correct.  Even though it sounds a little like an Adlib card, it is actually wavetable synthesis with a 64-sample wave.  It also supports vibrato and sweep envelopes.</div>
<br />
<br /> Hell, even 'wavetable' synthesis is the wrong term. Wavetable synthesis is specifically built around a series of short waveform in tables that are meant to change the timbre of a sound over time. It can emulate filters and other style synths (like FM). Look up PPG synths. Sample based synth isn't correct either (which the SNES uses) because the waveform memory is just too short to hold a prerecorded instrument sound per se. The closest thing for term is Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS). Although DDS tends to use a PHA instead of a period divider, but the principle is the same. The only other terms I've seen labeled for such a channel is PCMPSG and WSG (wave sound generation). Though they aren't specifically official terms.
<br />
<br /> And even if the modulation of the channel reached audible range, it's using a period divider instead of a PHA... so it won't be FM synthesis.

The Pokemon yellow pirate is truly exceptional and wholeheartedly not only belongs on the list of the top 100 best games for the system, but high up on that list. <br /><br />It may not be doing anything original, but its such a good copy of the GameBoy games it's truly astounding.

<br />
<br />This. Thank you for saying that as I completely agree with that statement. Too much attention is placed on the numbered order. For future top xx lists (SNES, GBA, etc) I'm thinking about not even including a numbering system at all. 
<br />
<br />Whenever I go I get people saying "bahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh the order how DARE you put StarTropics in the 90s", etc etc. 
<br />
<br />It's all about personal preference, and making lists like this is incredibly time consuming. If you don't like my order, make your own list and I challenge you to do it while making it half as presentable as my own.

<br />Still, it takes some skill to downscale the graphics for the NES. Lots of pirate NES games are great at simulating the look of SNES, Genesis and GBC games, proving that the NES is more capable than a LOT of licensed games would have you believe. I just wish the pirates were better coders (or have more time to work on each project).
