		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sup guys.  I know I haven't posted here a lot, but I felt that I should share my youtube series with you guys.  Anyway, What I'm doing here is taking NES roms and running them through a Python script that randomly changes bytes in random locations (in PRG ROM).  I then take footage from the now corrupted game (10 iterations) and put them on youtube.  So far, I have made three which are as follows:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avYK6Nw8NuM" class="postlink">1942</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTlfE1EGG2Y" class="postlink">Abadox</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITceAiHvB78" class="postlink">Al Unser Jr.'s Turbo Racing</a>
<br />
<br />I plan to go through my entire collection when I was a kid.  Afterwards I plan on taking various requests.  Anyway, I wanted to share my series with you guys for 3 reasons:
<br />
<br />1.  We all have something in common.  We're are all geeks that have a love for the NES and its hardware/software and how it al works etc.  I'm certain that you guys will take interest in this. :D
<br />
<br />2.  Some games I've corrupted does some pretty weird, unexplainable shit and I'm really curious as to why some corrupted games exhibit such strange behavior (outside of the already "normal" corrupted behavior you'd expect)  I figure some of you guys could enlighten me. :3
<br />
<br />3.  I'm hoping someone with hardware access can perhaps run my corruptions on real hardware and look for any discrepancies between hardware and various emulators.  In other words, I'm hoping that maybe my corruptions might uncover some hidden secrets tucked deep inside the NES that'll hopefully lead to better and more accurate emulation (and yeah I know it's pretty damn close to perfect anyway, but the more we find out, the more it benefits all of us, right?)
<br />
<br />Anyway, take a look, and let me know what you think :D

<br />
<br />I have very fond memories of doing that as a kid as well.  The Game Genie was my favorite NES accessory and the rom corruptions are a bit of a homage to those times.

<br />
<br />Oh I know that (at least the basics of what happens), but there are certain things that happen often and I am trying to figure out why it always shows such similar behavior.  My next vid will show a great example of this.

<br />
<br />Now pay attention to the first 4 or so iterations.  I seem to have run into a very similar.... effect.... the flashing screen with the horizontal lines and such.... what I want to know is, what exactly is going on there, and how come I kept getting that?

<br />Next game to get corrupted: A Boy and His Blob

<br />
<br />Interesting.  I think it may also have to do with how the game draws the course topography at the top of the screen.  At least that was my guess. Would you, or anyone for that matter, want the IPS files to study the phenomena?

<br />Probably.  Funny thing is though my vids are more entertaining, haha.
<br />
<br />Actually corrupting Action 52 would probably FIX most of the games.
