I agree. I was just wondering about copyrights, but I wasn't thinking I was going to be able to copyright FFVII NES. I was wondering if it was possible, but I suppose when I actually use my head, it's a stupid idea.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Mon Feb 06, 2006 4:02 pm</p><hr />

I don't know much. I know about people that had the project to release a 3D PC version of Chrono Trigger, and their project was shut down by Square Enix, but I don't think they got sued. They just got an advertisment, and they stopped. I don't know the exact details. Try to google "Chrono Trigger resurection" for more details.<br />The 3 possible ennemies are Nintendo, Square (now Square Enix) and Sony.<br />Nintendo just hates people using emulators and ROMs, but scince your ROM would be public domain Nintendo couldn't do anything.<br />Square and Sony aren't as hard than Nintendo and would be less crual about copirights, maket, etc...<br />However, I cannot see in the future if a such project is a risk or not. If you're too much afraid, switch to another project. Personally, I think if we're quiet it is no problem, but we have to be quiet...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Feb 05, 2006 5:45 am</p><hr />

1 - There is no ROM, because it is not a NES game.<br />2 - Square actually would proably less agressive than Nintendo is, they are more undersanding, I think. They won't loose money because of anyone remaking FFX or FFVII on the NES, because those games sells millions of copies arround the world, and the ports are way too different to make people downloading instead of buying (unlike playing a game under an emulator that is pretty much the same as buying it).<br />3 - Don't compare your FFVII project with their FFX project. Their just suck.<br />4- It's now up to you to organize the legal part of your project.<br />Copright something that breaks another copyright is really crazy.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Feb 05, 2006 2:58 am</p><hr />

Changing the title wouldn't matter much.  Creating new characters, story, and music would be more like it.  It's gotta be a new game, but that doesn't mean it can't be similar.<br /><br />Changing just enough to get by on a technicality is probably getting close to defrauding someone, heh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Feb 05, 2006 2:30 am</p><hr />

Okay that's cool, thanks. But what if you ported a game onto the NES? Like if those Final Fantasy X NES developers people actually made the game on the NES, and put it on a cart, they couldn't copyright it could they? But what if they like called the game "Fun and stuff" and did the graphics themselves, could they copyright it if they hid the fact that it was a remake well enough, while the fans playing it would know?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Feb 05, 2006 1:49 am</p><hr />

<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ61.html" class="postlink">Copyright Office Circular 61</a> should introduce you to the issues surrounding registering the U.S. copyright in your computer program. Here are some suggestions to run by an attorney or a non-attorney document preparer:<br /><br /><strong>Amount of identifying matter in Form TX</strong><br />Assembly language source code tends to be more narrow than (say) C source, and you may want to defend your registration against allegations that you padded the identifying portions with blank space to make it fill more pages. For the avoidance of doubt, consider pasting the source code into a two-column format using OpenOffice.org or the like. And don't forget to include a copy of the user manual as part of your deposit.<br /><br /><strong>"First" and "last" in Form TX</strong><br />If your program is longer than 50 pages, you can submit the first 25 and last 25 pages of your program. Trouble is that computer programs in the structured paradigm rarely have a distinct "beginning" or "end"; they're structured as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph" class="postlink">call graph</a>. A call graph is a directed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph" class="postlink">graph</a>, with nodes representing subroutines and edges representing JSRs. Luckily, a program without a lot of complicated recursion will result in a largely acyclic graph, and one common operation you can do on a directed acyclic graph is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting" class="postlink">topological sort</a>. Perform this on subroutines based on where they appear in the call graph, you end up with high-level code at one end and low-level code at the other. So you'll probably want to put the init code, main loop, and similarly high-level code as the "first" 25 pages, and your more low-level code (e.g. map decoding and blitting) into the "last" 25 pages.<br /><br /><strong>Which form?</strong><br />The Copyright Office form for most computer programs is Form TX. But if pictorial or graphic authorship dominates the work, as is usually the case in video games, you want Form PA. If you do file form PA, read over <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ55.html" class="postlink">Copyright Office Circular 55</a> and <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ45.html" class="postlink">Copyright Office Circular 45</a> to see what's involved in a PA filing.<br /><br />The statement of authorship for a video game is usually "Printed text and artwork, text of computer program, and audiovisual work". You'll probably have to include at least the following in your submission to the Copyright Office: <ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>the printed box, </li><li>the user manual, </li><li>the cartridge or CD-ROM containing object code, </li><li>a DVD containing a video walkthrough of your game, </li><li>a printed text description of the walkthrough, and </li><li>printed identifying materials for the program, as for Form TX above.</li></ol><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Feb 04, 2006 11:54 pm</p><hr />
