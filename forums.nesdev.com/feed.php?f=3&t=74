The stack is an area in RAM which is commonly used to store return addresses for subroutines, as well as other things.  Several instructions push values onto the stack, and some pull values from it.<br /><br />The stack lies in the $0100-$01FF range and grows downward... meaning $01FF is the bottom (start) of the stack.. and the stack grows towards $0100.<br /><br />The 6502 has a Stack Pointer register which is used when pushing/pulling values from the stack.  When emulating... a push can be done like so:<br /><br />RAM[ 0x0100 + SP ] = value_pushed;<br />SP--;<br /><br />and a pull can be done like so:<br /><br />SP++;<br />value_pulled = RAM[ 0x100 + SP ];<br /><br />where 'SP' is your variable representing the stack pointer (8-bit... always between $00 and $FF)<br /><br /><br />To visualize a stack... think of a stack of plates.  When you "push" a value... it's like placing a new plate on the stack... and when you "pull" a value, you're taking the plate which is currently on the very top of the stack off (and the plate below it becomes the new top).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Wed Dec 01, 2004 5:40 pm</p><hr />

<span style="color: darkred">Alright, what I did was take your info, and turned it into something I think is a step forward. If you wouldnt mind, please take a look at the (416Kb) ram-dump of 'Super Mario Bros (E).nes' I made. Do not worry about how to read it, as you may open it in notepad, as I dumped the addresses and values in hex format, with a return between each address for very easy reading. You may get this at:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nev.syntesis.org/neso/ram.log">http://nev.syntesis.org/neso/ram.log</a><!-- m --><br /><br />It starts at $8000 and goes to $FFFFFF.<br /><br />This must mean that the program starts off at $80, right? Does it mean I begin execution at ($8000+80) $8080?<br /><br />Also, if you could confirm that the values are indeed in the right spots, I would be very happy. I am still not so confident that I have loaded things 100% correctly...</span><br /><br />Thank you very much. <span style="color: darkred">Also, one more thing;<br /><br />On an exection, for example (JMP): $4C,$00,$F0 , I need to use the low byte / high byte conversion. Any idea of how I would convert these in decimal format?</span><br /><br />** <strong>EDIT</strong><br />I figured it out... r=number on the right, l=number on the left<br /><br />LOCATION = (r*256) Or l<br /><br />** <strong>EDIT #2</strong><br />Using rocknes, I opened smb and guess what? I looked at the "asm source" (which shows addresses and what commands are run beside them, and my ram.log file is correct, EXCEPT it is off by one byte.

1. Yes, you can use the decimal system, though you're going to be using different constants than everyone else. Many basic dialects supports hexadecmial constants though (i.e. &amp;H40F3).<br />I don't know much about the current versions of Blitz basic but if it's anything like the Amiga version I used to love then it should at the very least be possible to pull it off. Keep in mind that there's a good chance that you'll spend your time fighting the language, trying to make it do something it just wasn't designed for, and that's not something you'd want to discover half-way through the project.<br />It's also going to be tough to integerate any external libraries into Blitz Basic, thus you'll probably end up writing your own CPU and APU code (and PPU, but that's pretty much a given anyway).<br /><br />2. Don't worry about the iNES header's trainer. I don't think anybody's ever used it.<br /><br />3. Yes, the program ROM directly follows the header. And after that you've got the character ROM.<br /><br />4. Few games rely on proper sound emulation, so that's something you can hold of for a while. Most games need a somewhat accurate PPU emulation though. You can test most subsystems without involving an actual NES game so you don't have to write everything simultaneously.<br /><br />Lastly I want to note that this is a major project. Maybe you should start off by writing a small NES game or demo, this really helps you understand how the console works.<br />Another tip is to limit the scope of the project by splitting it up into smaller independent projects. Writing a 6502 emulator is a worthy project in itself.<br /><br />Oh, and don't forget to have fun writing it =)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">doynax</a> — Tue Nov 30, 2004 6:18 pm</p><hr />
