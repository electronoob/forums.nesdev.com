I think that some voters would take off points but the restriction is anything that clearly sounds like Famicom + anything else you want.

I've made a wrapper for GME and DUMB that'll convert formats they support to a WAV file that'll play in just about anything. It renders NSF, for example, at 1 minute per second on an Atom N450. If you want, I can post its source code.

Dropouts, noise and lag are the order of the day. YMMV of course.

Famitracker and NSFplay more or less work, but they still click/stutter slightly every second or two, and there's a faint hiss that doesn't show up when I dump to WAV and play with a native app.
