<br />
<br />The side-by-side comparison is a real ear and eye opener for people.  I often hear people talk about this or that emulator or this or that clone... but have they really, actually hooked the imitation and the real thing up to the same TV to compare?  When people compare DVD movie players, they run such tests.  It is not nit-picking.  It is the best way to judge the quality of an emulator or clone, in my opinion.  A (working) toaster is the gold standard.

<br />Rob, does this modification actually work for you?  The 72 pin edge connector you used is the wrong pitch (0.1" instead of 0.098").  The extra width adds up as you go down the connector.  I purchased a 0.1" pitch adapter and did some experimenting with it. After 11 pins the total accumulated "extra" has added up to more than the gap between pads.  This shorts out pins 11 and 12.  It actually is much worse than that, as I documented in this thread:<a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=619" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=619</a>

<br />
<br />Yeah, the error does build up something fierce.  With some playing around you MIGHT get it working, but it'd probably be pretty touchy.  Tennessee used a connector from a game genie so his didn't have this problem.  BTW if anyone wondered, the pitch on the NES connector is 2.5mm, instead of .1" which is 2.54mm.  I have no clue why they did this (since the Fami is .1" pitch) other than to make life difficult for people trying to make carts or something.  Prolly did it so that if someone wasn't watching, they'd screw it up and make it .1" and wonder why their cart was too big to fit!
<br />
<br />Also, the NES cart boards are only something like .042" thick, instead of the usual .062" thick that most PCBs are.  Fami boards are this thickness also, so just buying a 60 pin .1" connector will work for fami stuff but the board will be kinda loose in the connector (if it's designed for the more standard .062" thickness)

<br />
<br />I also posted a schematic of what I have traced so far.  Hopefully someone who knows the timing better can tell where to rewire the CIRAM /CE line from the cart.  I can easily trace the audio and video circuits but almost all of it is surface mount components with no markings.  Resistors are labelled but nothing else is.

<br />
<br />
<br />Hmmmmm.. verrrrrrrrrry interesting.
<br />
<br />I think I see why they dorked up the CIRAM connections... they appear to be using it to detect when a famicom cart is inserted!  God, what idiots.  "duuuh, these 2 pins are connected on the 5 carts I looked at! good enough for me!"   This signal then passes the audio thru the cart or not depending on if a fami cart is installed or not.   That's my take on it anyways.
<br />
<br />There are a couple things that got me kinda mystified though.  That "small glop" part in particular, and the 32K RAM chip.  Check the address lines on that RAM to see if they are using all 32K.  I suspect they may only be using 2K of it or something.
<br />
<br />That secondary gloptop is just odd... could it be some kind of ROM or something?  This thing doesn't have a "bios" does it?
<br />
<br />BTW, if you look at the NES on a chip closely, you can see a "Test point' that I *think* might be the signal you're after.  Look to the left of the "05.09.20" and you'll see a pad that doesn't go anywhere.  That could be the signal in question.  It's in about the right place on the bondout pattern.  There are a couple other pads like this on the left that could be something else useful... 
<br />
<br />Anyways, that's all I see at the moment.

<br />The only games I have problems with are Zelda (1) and Life Force, and I can't get my carts to boot on any other NES's either. However, I can pop in Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy, play for a bit, and not worry about the Blow Dance wiping out my saves.

They seem to share a lot of circuitry and there seems to be a lot that isnt used due to a couple unpopulated pads.  The small glob also gains a few new pins, mainly the unamplified video signal from the NOAC.  Maybe it is doing some of the video signal processing?  Might be interesting to grab the audio and video directly from the NOAC and wire them to a real NES system  =]
<br />
<br />The 32KB sram has all its address/data lines connected to the PRG address/data buses.  Wonder if this is a problem for games or addons that work with the unused memory areas?  Havent been able to check out the timing or test points because my logic analyzer is covered in about 6' of cardboard...

I'd cost me around $800 to $1500 to get the board stuffers "set up" to make the boards... they have to program their machines to place all the surface mount components. Also, there is the cost of getting the two solder paste stencils made, and then the boards made (setup charges there too) and then the cost of actually running the boards (more $$$) <br /><br />And then of course buying the parts too... that will cost alot of money too. I obviously can't "float" the project myself on the hope that someone will actually buy them to pay for the cost of making them. I put alot of work into this thing, and at this point I will have to put alot more work into it just to get them made... and by the time I do I won't have made a single cent on the project. I'm not looking to get rich or anything, but it'd be pretty frustrating having thousands of dollars pass through my hands, and I don't get to keep a single cent of it, even though I worked hundreds of hours on the project. <br /><br />Anyways, the cost of the chip DID go down... it's now something like $30 which is pretty reasonable IMO. I was looking at a USB host chip that you can get for $7 too... it was pretty neat; it might be a way to interface with controllers, harddrives, and memory keys without having to buy expensive connectors and stuff. That would vastly reduce the price of this console and reduce chip count and size something fierce. The only thing is it would need to have alot of software written. Just having 4 USB ports on the thing would make life alot simpler for sure. That'd allow keyboards, controllers, memory cards, and a connection to a host PC without too much problem so long as the software to control it could be written. <br /><br />So, the whole idea isn't dead yet... just kinda on the back burner while I try to figure out how to make it cheaper and smaller and better.</div>
<br />
<br />
<br />Well, it's definitely good to hear that the project isn't dead.  I honestly think no one else in the world has the knowledge and talent to do this, save for Nintendo themselves.  I applaud your efforts, Kev, and pray that you find a way to make this happen.  I really wish I had a way to help...I know you probably wouldn't want to take people's preorder $ this early in the game, but I would be one of the people willinng to do so, fyi.  If just a handful of others were willining to do the same, would this be incentive enough for it to get a little closer to the frontburner?

<br />
<br />Eliminating "legacy" ports (15 and 9-pin D-Sub ports) in the design and replacing them with USB ports may work even with the original controllers in the following manner:
<br />
<br />We will need NES-to-USB converters.  You could use a Super Smart Joy, but you would need to convert the physical port from SNES to NES.  Its problem, that it can't read the X and B or Y and A buttons at the same time, shouldn't be a problem with a NES controller, as its B and A buttons appear as X and B on a SNES.   I believe Atari people can use a Stelladaptor if Kevtris wishes to continue development in non-NES directions.

I don't know whether the Zapper will work with a non-CRT display, which we are increasingly seeing these days.  The power pad seems too expensive and delicate a device to be jumping up and down on these days, especially as we aren't kids anymore.  Only the Family Basic cartridges use the Keyboard as far as I know.  The loss of the Arkanoid paddle (which is required to beat those games) and the cassette recorder are unfortunate.  
<br />
<br />The Super Smary Joy does not deal with the extra lines, but who is to say that a better adapter could be in the works.  The removal of the legacy ports will eliminate the voltage level converters and help reduce the complexity of the circuitry.  This in turn should grant us a cost savings.
