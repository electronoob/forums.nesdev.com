		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello everyone, <br /><br />I'm working on a port of Wizard of Wor to the NES. <br /><br />Source code here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://github.com/tschak909/wow">http://github.com/tschak909/wow</a><!-- m --><br /><br />About<br />-------<br /><br />I am an experienced software engineer with some 6502 experience, and I recently completed an Atari VCS game of Dodgeball, which can be found here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://github.com/tschak909/dodgeball/">http://github.com/tschak909/dodgeball/</a><!-- m --> .. Have been a member of AtariAge since 2006 (and the Stella mailing lists since 1998), but this is my first venture into the NES homebrew community.<br /><br />I initially was going to try doing WoW for the ColecoVision, but it turned out that Opcode had beaten me to the punch <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.. So... Didn't see one for the NES...and thought, why not? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />I will be writing the primary game code in CC65, but for now, my concentration is on trying to make the graphics as accurate as possible. This is a challenge for me, as the original Astrocade based display runs at a different color clock, and therefore aspect ratio. (352x240) (As it happens, there are +2 more pixels in the horizontal direction, basically. so things need to be squeezed..also since I am targeting this for NTSC, there is less vertical space available.) <br /><br />I've managed to take enough of a pass at the graphics to start laying out nametables so I can get an idea of scale (these static nametables won't be used as such, but hopefully will be generated programmatically). <br /><br />Some of the chr's in yychr:<br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/yCAV5KV.png" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/yCAV5KV.png</a><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/dS6gBmc.png" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/dS6gBmc.png</a><br /><br />and in the middle of doing the first pass at the character screen. note the attribute clash. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/rqKqq9T.png" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/rqKqq9T.png</a><br /><br />I have been proceeding glacially at this for the last few weeks, but I am trying to be slow, patient, and precise. So i'll be working on the graphics for a while, until I can balance out accuracy for constraints... once I'm sure I can get everything squeezed in well enough, I'll start coding.<br /><br />The target for this guy is an NROM-256. If I can do it smaller...great. I don't see a need to do a mapper.<br /><br />Anyway, back to it. I hope all the American users have a good 4th of July. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />-Thom<br /><br />(edit: images were obnoxiously large due to my hi-dpi display. Turned them into URLs to be polite.)

I do intend completely to do the voice bits..given that the votrax SC-01 sounds have very limited spectra, you could get away with a ridiculously low sample rate and it be intelligible. <br /><br />Nukey Shay over at AtariAge pointed me to this blog, which has everything from the theory of operation manual, to level layouts (the theory of operation describes the level structure as an 11x6 grid of squares with 4 possible openings  (that'll make the level data structure REALLY easy, I think) so I can hopefully do the levels programmatically. <br /><br /><a href="http://wizard-of-wor-fan.blogspot.com/" class="postlink">http://wizard-of-wor-fan.blogspot.com/</a><br /><br />And a partial disassembly here at BalleyAlley: <a href="http://www.ballyalley.com/ml/ml_source/WOW_Latest_working_copy_of_full_disassembly_022104.asm" class="postlink">http://www.ballyalley.com/ml/ml_source/WOW_Latest_working_copy_of_full_disassembly_022104.asm</a><br /><br />I couldn't find a way to handle the star-field, yet... as for the sparkly red text, i'll just do a palette switch in the NMI between the red and black...<br /><br />But for now, I'm just doing all the graphic work to make it all fit onscreen. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/R0LvVoq.png" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/R0LvVoq.png</a>  title screen should work nicely...<br /><br />-Thom

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am currently trying to figure out whether I can actually fit the original level structures into the slightly smaller screen on the NES, versus the Astrocade hardware.<br /><br />The levels in Wizard of Wor are actually created from a symmetrical pattern that is based on a grid of 11 horizontal squares, and 6 vertical squares, of which there can either be a wall or an opening on either side. I can represent this just fine with a data structure, and with the 2x3 metasprites I am using (to be as true to the game as possible) I can't make this fit...<br /><br />Does anyone see a way, from these pictures or my description that I could make something that could fit? or should I just make my own level patterns?<br /><br />(would anyone really give a #%()#@ if I used different maze patterns? I'd rather not, because I want to be as accurate as possible, but I do understand when brick walls are hit.)<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://i.imgur.com/uYzfqTx.png">http://i.imgur.com/uYzfqTx.png</a><!-- m --><br /><br />From theory of operation:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Each dungeon consists of an eleven by six matrix of squares, with a wall or opening on the sides of each square.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Based on the screenshots on <a href="https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10459" class="postlink">the game's KLOV page</a>, the original game's cells are 24x24 pixels. It runs on a board whose pixel clock appears to be 7.16 MHz according to MAME's <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">astrocde</tt> driver. This makes its pixel aspect ratio 6:7, which is narrower than the 8:7 of an NES. A PAR-accurate scaling to ColecoVision/NES pixels would result in 18x24 pixel cells, or 2 1/4 by 3 tiles per cell.<br /><br />Here are your practical options to make it fit:<br /><br /><ul><li>Each cell is 16x24 pixels or 2x3 tiles, and the 11x6-cell playfield is 176 by 144 pixels.</li><li>Each cell is 20x24 pixels or 2.5x3 tiles, and the 11x6-cell playfield is 220 by 144 pixels.<br />This requires separate tiles for walls being in the left or right half of each cell. It also pushes the column of figures to the left and right side of the playfield into the overscan area, but it's fine if you're willing to move the figures below the playfield, as is done in CBS's Atari 2600 port of <em>WOW</em>.</li></ul><br />And you might end up needing to draw new level maps anyway, as level maps and sprite graphics are the first thing that copyright lawyers would seize on.<br /><br />I'm working on illustrations of what 16x24 and 20x24 pixel cels would look like inside the 256x240 pixel picture.

Of course, you don't want to use a mapper, so this is academic.]

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The NTSC NES PPU outputs all 240 scanlines. Some just get cut off by the TV because of overscan.<br /><br />In an arcade game, the arcade operator enters service mode, which displays various test patterns on the display, and adjusts the monitor's size and position controls to make the picture exactly fill the monitor. But in a game for a console, the developer has to put up with the picture size that the TV actually displays, and this varies from one SDTV to another. You can't change how much is cut off, but you can use scrolling to determine whether it's cut off at the top or bottom or a little of both.<br /><br />There are various &quot;safe area&quot; definitions that approximate upper and lower bounds on the overscan size for typical TVs. See <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Overscan" class="postlink">&quot;Overscan&quot; on the wiki</a> for these.
