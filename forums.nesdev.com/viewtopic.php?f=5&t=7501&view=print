		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yesterday, I was out for a walk and slipped on a patch of ice. I had my PSP 2000 in my breast pocket. I landed on my thigh, not on my chest or anything. After I got up I checked my PSP and it seemed to be fine, until later when I tried to launch a game.
<br />
<br />The problem I'm experiencing is whenever I launch any PSP game or any homebrew, the analog stick is constantly pushing to the left.
<br />
<br />I read online about the problem and that its usually caused by dirty connections or loose screws.
<br />
<br />I did the obvious system information recalibration, but that didn't seem to work. I applied pressure to the faceplate, but again that didn't do a whole lot once I let go of the pressure on the faceplate.
<br />
<br />So, I've opened it up and removed the analog nub assembly completely. What am i suppose to do with it? It doesn't look especially dirty, but I'd like to clean it to see if that will help.
<br />
<br />Here's the part that has me worried. Just out of curiosity, I tried powering the PSP back on with the analog nub completely removed - and the right analog input is still being registered as constantly on! How can that even be with the nub completely removed? The only thing I can think of is perhaps its a problem with the D-pad, but in the main PSP menu the D-pad works correctly. I'm confused.
<br />
<br />Anyone have any suggestions for things I should try?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Without the nub its normal for the system to think some direction is pressed. The nub is 2x potentiometers in single casing, and the position of the nub is determined by the resistance on the pots, no pots = certain resistance seen by the machine which translates to some certain direction.
<br />
<br />Clean the nub up, perhaps even bend its brushes a bit and reassemble and hope for the best

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Now we know why Nintendo's <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonkaTough" class="postlink">Tonka-tough reputation</a> took a hit once its products started incorporating moving parts such as analog sticks, optical disc drives, and flip-up screens. The first thing to go on a GameCube controller, for example, is the left analog stick. And on a DS Lite, the L and R buttons are the first thing to go, and I'm pretty sure their design was a compromise due to the requirement of a flip-up screen.
