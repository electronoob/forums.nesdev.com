I can agree to the point that if you never developed a NES game before you shouldn't grab MMC5 and start some crazy complex game using every feature it has. But using a mapper like MMC1 or UNROM or CNROM is perfectly reasonable.

Yes, It isn't always about getting more space that's needed, but I mean, why use something with such a feature and abilities and not tap anything more complex at all then *just* that feature? It doesn't make sense to me kinda but oh well.....It's just kind of a "Waste of Resources" thing it seems to do such a thing. <br /><br /><br />Yeah, a MMC3 demo would be fine to test stuff and you have to do some to learn to use stuff like that. But to only make a 32K game not something with lots of levels and such seems almost like a waste IMO.<br /><br /><br /><br />I hope we get a MMC3 cart on RetroUSB soon....that'd be epic. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Sun Nov 07, 2010 6:58 pm</p><hr />

Using a mapper isn't necessarily about getting more space... You might pick the MMC3 for its scanline counter, or UNROM so that you can use CHR-RAM in order to be able to animate your background tiles, and so on, but that doesn't mean you have to use more than 16/32KB. You are just allowed to, and that's a good thing.<br /><br />Most absolute NES newbies do start with NROM programs, but like MottZilla said they never get released because they are not complete games, just tests used for learning. Also, just because a person just got started with the NES, that doesn't mean they are complete newbies to classic console programming. Some have already worked with other platforms, and already have a good understanding of bankswitching and other common aspects, they are just getting acquainted to the 6502 or the PPU, and there is no need for these people to hold back.<br /><br />Another important point is that a smaller program is not always simpler than a large program. consider this: an uncompressed screen on the NES is 1KB large (32x32 tiles + 64 attribute bytes). If I'm a newbie and want to make a game with several (100 or so) screens, what would you say is easier: using UNROM to store all the uncompressed screens across the available banks or spending a lot of time understanding how compression works and coding compression and decompression algorithms? I'd say it's much easier to code a 3-line bankswitching function and use the uncompressed maps. I know this is a crude example, but it goes to show that smaller isn't always the same as simple.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Nov 07, 2010 6:46 pm</p><hr />

tokumaru is right. While I agree with the idea behind NROM first if you mean don't bite off more than you can chew, in practice for an actual game even if it is your first you should use whatever mapper you want. <br /><br />Most people don't actually release their first NES programs as they are still learning and likely just making things to test out. They aren't yet making a full game. And tokumaru is right again that a mapper doesn't dictate if your game is fun or not. There are great games that use no mapper or very simple mappers like SMB1 and Castlevania/MegaMan. There are also pretty bad games, even horribly awful games that use very complicated mappers. Just see mapper 90 for some <em>great</em> examples of this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Sun Nov 07, 2010 7:32 am</p><hr />

UNROM and CNROM for example are very decent mappers for beginners, as long as they understand the concept of bankswitching, since these are not as restrictive with the graphics.<br /><br />I for example have never finished a NES game (yet), but I've done a lot of practicing and I know I can do a lot more than what NROM would allow me to, so my first game will most likely not be on an NROM board.<br /><br />What you can't expect is that mappers do all the work for you. Using an MMC5 will not automatically make your game great if you can't think of interesting ways to use the mapper's features.<br /><br />Also, using a mapper doesn't mean you have to make a big game and fill up 512KB of ROM, you could very well make a 32KB MMC3 game just because you're interested in its scanline counter. If you understand how the scanline counter works, it will actually be much easier to use it than go with NROM and have to monkey around with time code, sprite 0 hits and DPCM IRQs to achieve a similar effect.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Nov 06, 2010 9:58 pm</p><hr />

It depends on what the requirements are.  There's not much of a limit to what you can put on an NES cart, but you'll have to define what you meant about resources.<br /><br />Having an ideal setup, would require an ideal game for an example.<br /><br />I had completed 4 NES board designs (the 3 oldest ones are pictured <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/35865006@N00/1284712212/in/photostream/" class="postlink">here</a>), I have a couple more planned, one of them sooner, it's a pretty decent and should be pretty cheap.  Here's the (planned) specs:<br /><br />-PRG (FlashROM) $8000 and $C000 are banked independently, 512kB max.<br />-CHR-RAM Is banked, also twice independently, at $0800-$0FFF and $1800-$1FFF. the rest is fixed. (16 * 2kB)<br />-registers at $5000-$5007<br />-(optional) WRAM is banked (4 * 8kB)<br /><br />The other one I'll be doing later (complete Squeedo redesign) will be pretty extreme in it's capabilities.. and will be more expensive, for it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Nov 04, 2010 6:50 pm</p><hr />

If your 1st game is over that, you might be getting a -tad- froggy.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> <br /><br /><br />And as for it, yeah it can be done, but you have to make/hack the hardware in and write games. I know I am making a 1MB SN2ROM (My name for it) for messing with a project next up in the future. It can be done, but sometimes is just better to get to this a lot later.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Thu Nov 04, 2010 6:45 pm</p><hr />

A lot of big flash chips are 3.3 V, or I2C serial, or block-organized NAND. To use serial or block memory effectively, you need a big PRG RAM.
