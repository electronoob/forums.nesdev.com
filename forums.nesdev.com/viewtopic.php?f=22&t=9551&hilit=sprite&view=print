		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, that was about alternating between two sprites to get more colors through the checkerboard pattern, but apparently that technique outright doesn't work properly at all due to how the NES generates the video signal (lots of color interference, and also the half-dot shenanigans).<br /><br />I think slobu is talking about using a solid <span class="posthilit">sprite</span> that flickers. That isn't prone to those issues... but flickering is noticeable no matter how hard you try. A good example of this would be the shield in Sonic 2, it's blatantly obvious it's flickering even at the speed it goes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When I visited Europe before the lead-in-CRTs ban, I could see an obnoxious flicker on standard 288i OTA broadcast. At 50Hz.<br /><br />Whether or not flicker is visible basically depends on the refresh rate, ambient lighting levels, and whether the average luminosity changes too much. (example: bits of the UI in Chrono Cross have single scanline high high-contrast elements. I can see them flicker at 30Hz, stupid interlaced video modes) HOWEVER &quot;average luminosity&quot; is something that's spread in space as well, hence checkerboard interleaving being better. Saying that it's never appropriate is blatantly untrue. (When we discussed this last time, Sik mentioned that he uses it <em>everywhere</em> in <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=101108#p101108" class="postlink">ProjectMD</a>. And it looks <strong>good</strong>.)

This is a great reason why I use my more modern LCD TV.

And it looks <strong>good</strong>.)</div><br />There's a difference though, here we're discussing about flickering between two solid blocks of color, while what Project MD does is alternate between two checkerboard patterns (which is <em>a lot</em> less noticeable since the areas are tiny and you're always seeing both colors at the same time). Moreover, it only looks right when the colors are close, in the few areas where Project MD uses this for translucency instead of gradients it's a lot more noticeable (although the monitor refresh rate not matching the emulated game probably isn't helping...).<br /><br />Also it looks right on the Mega Drive because it doesn't do anything weird with the pixels, the NES has the whole half dot shifting issue that apparently interferes a lot with the effect (not to mention that colors are usually much further apart).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It's true the flickering is less noticeable if the colours are close together.

That's why I decided to take the checkerboard flicker approach in Project MD.

Dithering creates weird diagonal lines on CRT displays like this:<br /><br /><img src="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y191/macbee/sols.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />You can see this even on this official Solstice video: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://youtu.be/894_PNqBkx4?t=26s">http://youtu.be/894_PNqBkx4?t=26s</a><!-- m --><br />I also given up on flickering of checkerboard dithered images for the same reason. Flicker using horizontal lines is still less ugly (on CRT TVs) than dithering IMHO.
