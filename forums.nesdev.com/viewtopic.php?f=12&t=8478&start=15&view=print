<br />
<br />Agreed, although I must admit there's also been some really shitty soldering coming out of retrousb too since there's been lots of defective cart reports with stuff like the Super Power Pak.

<br />Support is horrid from retrousb.  Plus, you are using a circuit board that was designed in some dudes house, so who knows how long the thing will last, if it will burn into flames from overheating, short circuit your system, etc.  Ill take a cart from original parts that had millions spent in quality testing any day of the week.

<br />
<br />I have labels for some of the FF/DQ series, but for some I was having trouble finding the best translation.  On one DQ (I think) you would get more gold than you could spend the whole game  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Seiken Densetsu 3 has the same problem where there are so many versions and multiplayer hacks it may be hard to find the best.

<br />
<br />Designed at some dude's house? Oh my. Since when does it matter where the pcb was designed? Quality of the build matters, and I would think he doesn't use some terrible board manufacturer. While the original parts certainly are of great quality, once people start hacking them up and soldering wires it is no longer of that robust quality. The weakest link is the worksmanship then of the cartridge hacker. And sorry but anytime you are using a bunch of wires to hookup the rom chip that is never going to be as good as components that are properly soldered to the board. 
<br />
<br />I haven't exactly bought an extensive amount of stuff from RetroZone but both my PowerPAK cartridges have been excellent. The build quality seems solid to me.
