Power-cycling at just the right time might cause the vblank flag to be true even during picture. From the article:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If the NES is powered on after having been off for less than 20 seconds, register writes are ignored as if it were a reset, and register starting values differ: $2002 = $80 (VBL flag set)</div><br />So the first BIT is to turn off the vblank flag.

<br />I agree, but unless your program ABSOLUTELY NEEDS to exploit hardware quirks, it's better to play safe and obey the basic rules than risk making it unstable even on hardware just for the heck of it.

<br />Wow I just absolutely love that Bad Apple...fantastic!  It tells a story, is entertaining, is crisp, and very well done.  None of that can be said for the other demo.  However, I couldn't produce either, so I can't really complain.

So story, entertaining, etc is not merit of the demo, it is just a image sequence player. So the demo we discussing here is actually better as a demo than the Bad Apple demo.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just to shed some light on this:
<br />
<br />ASM2011 was brought to my attention by a Swedish friend of mine, who told me "Hey! Check out this live feed, they're playing NES demos".  When I got around to checking, they were playing the demo mentioned here.
<br />
<br />I was absolutely appalled.  *That* was what someone came up with?  Hol-y-shit.  The instability of the graphics, and just the whole nature of absolute gobbledegook all over the screen... I said "Are they doing this on an emu which isn't playing it right?  Is it NTSC and they're playing it on PAL, since this is in Finland?  WTF!".  Said Swedish friend wasn't sure, but he too agreed it looked like shit.
<br />
<br />Fast forward a few days.  He gets back to me: apparently the demo is *supposed* to look that way, citing "artistic representation".  (EDIT: Literal quote: "it's an art statement").
<br />
<br />For what it's worth, the 3-4 demos after that all had the same general style (there was a 386/DOS + VGA one which was a complete joke.  I hoped it was a 64KByte compo or something, but it wasn't).
<br />
<br />Here's my take on it: drugs.  I'm not bullshitting either.  Drugs are the only explanation.  I cannot tell you how many times I've run into either stoned or people tripping on {insert psychadelic of your choice here} trying to tell me how cool something looks (or sounds) when in fact it's complete shit.  I pretty much throw this demo into that category.  Drugs are the only explanation.  And this statement comes from a guy who's done LSD twice and tried marijuana a couple times (bad drug for me to take; makes me the most paranoid bastard on the planet, it mixes *very* badly with my social and generalised anxiety).
<br />
<br />I'll go as far as to probably piss off one of the coolest guys on the nesdev forum here -- Memblers.  I remember many years ago (10+) and Memblers was doing some occasional NES music "stuff", combined with some occasional code/demo-esque stuff.  It was all crap (sorry pal, it was).  None of it had any rhythm or organisation; it was like you were on serious hard-core drugs when you were creating all of this and thought it was interesting/awesome.  It wasn't.  Fast forward to today, and all I see are super cool works and songs which have good rhythm and organisation to them.  Plus (I think) you cut your hair.  So I'm left thinking "maybe he stopped doing as many drugs"... ;-)
<br />
<br />But then again, I love Pink Floyd but think most of Dark Side of the Moon sucks.  *shrug*

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Like I said, there is a genre of demo that this demo is seems belong to. Demos in this genre looks like they are result of a computer glitch, some noise or garbage that sometimes makes certain shapes. There is a kind of such music too. So no drugs or shitty coding necesarrily involved, it easily could be intentional.
<br />
<br />For example, a demogroup skrju made many demos in this genre for ZX Spectrum. Check some of them out to see similarity (youtube): <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFUI0I1HOuI" class="postlink">why</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVyn_ylZSiY" class="postlink">idiot</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7gVoLAYKEA" class="postlink">fuckyouscene</a>. This genre is highly controversial, with two general opinions: complete crap or complete genious.
