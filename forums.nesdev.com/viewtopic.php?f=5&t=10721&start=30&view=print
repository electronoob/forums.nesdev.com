That machine also uses PSARM as VRAM. This machine should have had DMA unit to move data, the CPU cannot saturate the bandwidth in any case, and the chip can do way more that games show, much like Master System where CPU can only use up 20% of available bandwidth.

The way it is being described sounds extremely similar to the VDP timing sheet on spritesminds, except the sPPU data bus is half the size, but twice the speed, and fetches one tile at a time, instead of two tiles at once.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I know that the 65816 requires fast memory because it has a multiplexed data/address bus, but since the SNES uses a custom Ricoh chip, couldn't they have gotten the bus multiplexer removed, and had allowed the chip to run at 5.37 or 7.16 Mhz instead?  Because the DMA is built into the Ricoh chip, couldn't they have ran DMA at 5.37 or 7.16 Mhz too?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Multiplexing has little to do with it. Even the non-multiplexed 6502 needs a half cycle to generate each address. A 6502 family CPU divides the CPU cycle into low and high halves. An address is ready by the start of the high half, and the data has to be ready by the end.<br /><br />If it helps, think of each 65816 cycle as two cycles, address generation and memory access, because other CPUs like Z80 and 68000 that allow a whole cycle for memory access tend to be clocked faster to compensate for their lower IPC. If you put a divide by 2 in front of a 65816's clock input, that'd correspond to an &quot;internal operation&quot; cycle after each memory access. And just as the Amiga used the 68000's copious &quot;internal operation&quot; cycles for video, the Apple II used &quot;internal operation&quot; half-cycles for video.

The VIC-II is able to fetch most, but not all, of its data during those same half-cycles. Outside of that, on one of every eight scanlines, the VIC-II steals 40 cycles from the 6510 to read character pointers (analogous to nametable data) and two cycles for each sprite that's active.
