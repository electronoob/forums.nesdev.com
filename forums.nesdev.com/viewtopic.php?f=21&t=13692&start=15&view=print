So right now I only have like four squares of the ground finished, so I haven't bothered packing into the PPU space.  (I guess it's better to get some feedback on the base design before I push in all the details anyway.)<br /><br />Also I tried two different designs for the top layer of the ground; one with little rocks in in and one without.  IMO one looks much better than the other, but I decided I'd like to get some feedback before I send one to the chopping block.<br /><br />Beyond that it's the same ideas as the first set; same game and such.<br /><br /><img src="http://eightballgaming.com/img/Sample2x002.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://eightballgaming.com/img/Sample_Proof002.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I'm going to try some revisions to my first tileset and hopefully get that posted in the next couple days.

Have the simple design without the pebbles, and then place the pebbles tile on top of it at various places.

Second, what in the world is going on with the trees in the background? They're outlined in red. Third, the leaves on the trees should be much less repetitive, and finally, I imagine a tree with a canopy that large would have a thicker trunk. You could make it take up four tiles as the base, but make it get a bit skinnier as it goes up, like the trees in the background.<br /><br />Oh, and just to let you know, I'm a guy. Out of the hundred or so people I know on this website, I've never come across a single girl. Kind of weird, but I guess this stuff just isn't as popular with them.

Either with or without the small stones on it. Also, the edges of the ground tiles looks particularly awful, those edges should definitely be smoothed, using the repeating pattern tile on a border is often a bad idea.

Take a look at real forests and you see grass, weeds, leaves, etc. But never piles of round rocks.<br /><br />Tree trunks - the background trunks look weird, their shapes are too squished.<br /><br />Tree leaves - a bit repetitive. I feel like there should be some negative space (holes) or branches. Or maybe go the other direction, and do a more minimalist thing (flatter and less detailed) would hide the repetitiveness.

Anyway though, I thought that the ground (if it isn't like the side of a cliff) is supposed to look like if you split the ground in half right there and you're looking inside, so in this case, there wouldn't be weird carrot rocks.<br /><br />I thought the trees in the background looked odd, as the game is supposed to be directly 2D where everything is perfectly facing the camera, but the trees in the background start above the grass by a good amount, so I made my own grass that actually meets up with the start of the trees:<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

There should be more soil between them, and none of that should be that orange color, more like dark brown and potentially gray for the rocks. (Like I said, small rocks.)

It didn't seem so bad when it was blocky in the first tileset, but it wasn't right here.  I will likely save it for a cave or something, but I'll have to make the forest have something that looks more dirt.<br /><br />*******<br /><br />So, what I was originally trying to do with the canopy was something like this:<br /><img src="http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/83421-mega-man-6-nes-screenshot-plant-man-s-stage.png" alt="Image" /><br />But I simply failed to draw something that looked acceptable.  I kept drawing again and again until I got the pattern seen above.  And everyone keeps saying its repetitive, but I used four tiles plus an offset pattern.  Is repetitive really the right word?  I honestly do NOT see a repeating pattern in those leaves.<br /><br />Before I wound up mirroring the leaves, the canopies weren't really supposed to identify a specific tree.  I wanted something that just looked like a solid mess of canopy, like you see here:<br /><img src="http://sydlexia.com/imagesandstuff/nesjobbers/moblin2.png" alt="Image" /><br />...But with more detail; using more tiles and looking less blocky.<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback, everyone.  I'll try this again in a few days.
