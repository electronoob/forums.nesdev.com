It looks like a diode, but I have no idea what value it would be... <br /><br /><img src="http://retrostage.net/chinesecart.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I made a voltage divider using a 47ohm and 100ohm resistor to get to 3.3 volts, and made a Star Ocean cart using a 29L3211 chip. It works for a few minutes but stalls at the same spot during the intro every time. I then connected the cart (ran long wires from the Vcc on <span style="text-decoration: underline">my</span> 29L3211) to these diode-looking things and the game worked perfectly.<br /><br />Anyone have any ideas? Is my voltage regulator made incorrectly?<br /><br /><br />EDIT: before anyone asks, my voltage divider is:  +5V------R1-50ohm------+3.3V------R2-100ohm------GND

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />They're diodes as you guessed, just lacking anything beyond the end terminals in glass. Their benefit is that the voltage drop is mostly independent of the load put on them, unlike your resistive divider, whose voltage varies based on the load (and dissipates lots of power regardless of load, the tradeoff to make it &quot;stiffer&quot; in the face of a varying load).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />so is there any way to tell what type of diode they are? The 2nd and 3rd on the right are cascaded together, and then go directly to the 3.3v chip.<br /><br />I am interested in this because I dont understand why my voltage regulator causes the game to freeze... but these dont. Does it handle things differently?<br /><br /><br />Also, the game works fine in my FCtwin, no crashes there using my voltage divider. But its on my SnesJR that it stalls every time, but not when using these diodes.

Also monitor the +5V into your divider, in case you're severely loading the SNES power supply. Hmmm, maybe a capacitor in parallel with your divider's output would help?

As long as anything is sinking ~any current at all through it, it'll be about the same voltage.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, that makes sense that the capacitor helped. CMOS makes little blips of high current draw when gates change state, especially a lot at once. Since your divider's output voltage depends on load, the voltage would be dropping momentarily during these high-current blips. The capacitor gives a strong output even during these. I had forgotten this important reason for small caps across the power rails of CMOS chips.

So, apparently the way I had the cap in the voltage divider caused the divider not to work. crap.<br /><br />Can you draw a diagram of how this cap should be hooked up in parallel to this voltage divider? I googled it, and I found a bunch of lightbulb diagrams and things like that but nothing to really apply to my cart.
