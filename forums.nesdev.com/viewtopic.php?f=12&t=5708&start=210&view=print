I have a PAL SNES, 2/1/3, SNSP-001A(UKV) and a 2 GB Kingston CF (that works perfect with the NES Powerpak). <br /><br />First of all, the CF only "works" if it's formatted to FAT32, because if I format the card to FAT then the Powerpak gives me a "CONFIG file not found" error. With FAT32, I can see the games list, but when I execute any of them, it just shows a black screen or it executes the game with a lot of graphic glitches and then it hangs, even with DMA=0.<br /><br />I think it can be a CF compatibility problem, but before spending 30+ â‚¬ in a Dane-elec one, I prefer to make sure this is the problem. Any ideas?</div>
<br />
<br />Finally I bought a Sandisk Ultra II 2 GB and works like a charm with my PAL SNES, even with DMA=1. I had to format the CF to FAT32, because with FAT format the Powerpak still gave me the "CONFIG file not found", but in FAT32 it works perfect.
<br />
<br />So, if anyone of you are having problems with a PAL SNES (at least with 2/1/3 hw), check if you can get a Sandisk Ultra II 2 GB, because in my case it worked.

<br />Thanks again. Don't think I will need to do that now, though. My retro duo v2 just arrived. It works flawlessly with the PowerPak and as far as I can see it emulates the SNES 100% accurate, with a consistent 60 fps. Also, all the games that had problems (on the other PAL SNES I mentioned) are all working without an issue now. Very impressed so far, yet to come across a problem...

<br />There you have another video. Is the Powerpak defective? Never any problem to copy the games from CF card.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah. I don't really understand these people that want to put all ROMs in their CF cards, specially considering that a bunch of them doesn't even work with the PowerPak. The exact same think happens with the NES PowerPak.
<br />
<br />Aren't people already satisfied with the fact that pirating a game and saving it in the card is already 100 times easier than going to the store and buying cartridges at retail price like it was back in the 90's? Nowadays the internet is your 24h free game "store", and your CF card can be your game shelf. You don't need to have everything, just what you actually like and play.
<br />
<br />If someone was committed to finishing all SNES games in existence they wouldn't do anything else for the rest of their lifetime.

<br />
<br />A year ago or so, I tried every ROM in the goodset in the hope of finding some overlooked gems. Eventually dug up some cool japanese games I didn't know yet and even bought a couple of these afterwards.
<br />There are also a couple of interesting unlicensed/pd ROMs that you'd hardly know about if you didn't try each of them.
<br />Whether someone actually needs a complete set on one card is debatable, but it does have advantages.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have come back with a few (probably) minor suggestions for possible software revisions for the PowerPak.
<br />
<br />1) ".smc" sometimes comes up (for me at least) as ".|mc".  It might be nice to fix that, though it's hardly a huge deal.
<br />2) The PowerPak doesn't seem to recognize read-only files, which I can save over just fine.  I wish I could flag some saves as permanent.  Conversely, making files hidden works to the point where making the POWERPAK directory hidden (to clear up a wasted line on screen) makes it stop working.  These again are no big deal, but it would be nice if they got changed.
<br />3) This may be a pipe dream, but it would be sweeet to have an option in CONFIG.TXT to allow automatic loading of sram files (i.e. savefiles are automatically loaded where "[game title].srm" exists).
<br />4) PAR instead of less-useful GG codes would also be great.  If I want GG codes, I'll just convert them to PAR.
<br />
<br />BTW, my working SFC is 2/1/3, in case that helps in any way.  I'll try and figure out what my nonworking Super Nintendo is when I next visit my dad's house (but he lives several hours away)...

<br />I can tell you now that Pit-Fighter and Super Noah's Ark 3D aren't among them though, so you can safely leave them (and a lot of other stuff) off. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />
<br />EDIT: Now I'm sure: It IS better:
<br />
<br />-Chrono trigger with french patch: super famicom: HANG (CF ERROR), Yobo: Works.
<br />
<br />Only problem... yobo's reset is not really a reset (more an automatic on/off)... so I can't save.
