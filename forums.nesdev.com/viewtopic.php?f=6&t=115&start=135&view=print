<br />There is also more NSF's in the NSF collection and several that are not on the list. One of them is Final Lap (N106) for instance.  Thanks for the long overdue list and yeah that was a heck of a lot of work.

<br />I also have a rip of Door Door, but it behaves differently in different players. In NSFplug, it freezes after the first note. In GNSF, the channels are out of sync with eachother. It appears to play just fine in NotSoFatso and FCEUltra. I can't figure out exactly what is wrong with it.

<br />I've looked at Battletoads some more, and unfortunately, I haven't been able to make much progress in adding the PCM. The PCM loop is rather complicated and has been very resistant in my attempts to make it a finite routine.
<br />
<br />@ugetab: Thank you for your NSF rips and the NSF compilation list. I just want to point out that the link you have listed for my page is out of date (I used it as a temporary page when my main one was down).

<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.angelfire.com/nc/ugetab/NSFList.txt">http://www.angelfire.com/nc/ugetab/NSFList.txt</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />It wasn't really hard to compile. I used Excel's web page importing feature to handle the tables, and just copied the names to the document(paste special&gt;unformatted text). For NSFColl.zip, I just used cmd, browsed to the unzipped archive, and did a 'dir /B /S &gt; NSFColl.txt', and trimmed out the folder names and the path. A bit of minor formatting with a free word processor removed excess spaces before and after the names in the whole document. It wouldn't be hard to completely redo a section the next time it needs to be updated.
<br />
<br />
<br />Also, since it would feel like a waste just to include that info...
<br />
<br />I don't know how much help, if any, this will be...but here's a few codes that may lead to the games being more rippable, and at least, provide the music through codes and an FCE emulator...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Looking at RAM, it looks like Bases Loaded uses a driver that I've seen pop up a lot (some Jaleco titles, Datach titles, others). 
<br />
<br />For Bases Loaded, try this. In the init routine, write #$FF to $45D, $472, $487, $49C, $4B1, $4C6, $4DB (these addresses differ in different games, but they must have #$FF in them for the music to play). 
<br />
<br />For choosing the tune, the channels are done independently by writing to $FC and then JSRing to $AD8E (on the 0x12000 page). So for the title screen, do something like: 
<br />LDA #$00, STA $FC, JSR $AD8E, 
<br />LDA #$01, STA $FC, JSR $AD8E, 
<br />LDA #$02, STA $FC, JSR $AD8E, 
<br />LDA #$03, STA $FC, JSR $AD8E.
<br />
<br />$FD may need to have the value #$84. I'm not sure about this - haven't checked.
<br />
<br />Not all tunes use 4 channels, some will use less. For example, another tune seems to use only #$0A, #$0B, #$0C. 
<br />
<br />To handle this, you can either use 4 tables (one for each channel, write #$FF to $FC if the channel isn't used) or use a loop with a table giving the number of times to loop through for each tune based on the number of channels.
<br />
<br />I haven't tried this particular rip at all so I don't know if this will work, but based on my experience, I think it will.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is probably already documented somewhere, but the way to make non-bankswitched tunes play in FCEU(and hence, it's debugger) is to give it some default banks to use.
<br />
<br />If the load address is 0x8000 and has 0x8000 data, number 0x00 through 0x07 at 0x70 through 0x77. If the load address is 0x8000 with 0x4000 data, number 0x00 through 0x03 at 0x70 through 0x73. If it's 0xC000 with 0x4000 data, number 0x00 through 0x03 at 0x74 through 0x77. This should be pretty simple to extrapolate to anything non-standard.

Seems like I may just have some chance of making it work if I can work on it with that debugger...or at least know why I won't be able to make it work.
<br />
<br />(I have the rip playing not 15 minutes after throwing the code around in that debugger)

<br />Two of the rips are for the arcade VS Excitebike, which has different tunes from the FDS version. The current rip of FDS Excitebike is missing a few songs, notably the main theme that plays when you're racing on a track. 
<br />
<br />Another game that could use a rensf is Rush N Attack. Its missing 3 songs, the ending theme, the game over theme, and the theme that plays when you go underground. (This was something you could do in the FDS version Green Beret, that Rush N Attack apparently removed for some reason. After destroying land mines, a ladder would sometimes appear and you could climb down it.)

<br />I finally found the error in Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle, so that's up now as well. It just needed a lookup table address to be loaded on init.
<br />
<br />Also, in FCEUXDSP, to be able to use the Hex Viewer on an NSF file, load a game, open the hex viewer, then load the NSF you want to debug.
<br />
<br />Found and fixed all the init errors I made in Monopoly, so it works now.
<br />
<br />Added Bases Loaded 2. It's unsorted, because the requester seems to want sound effects in his NSFs, and there's only 1 bit of looping music after the main collection of them, that I heard.
