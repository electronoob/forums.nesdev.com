It would be possible to adjust it perhaps, but given you had to ask confirms that fixing it for PAL is not within your capability. Besides, being in a PAL area you might as well get a NTSC NES anyway to give yourself the ability to play all games, not just pal.

<br />That's why I don't like the Konami VRC interrupt and find them even worse than MMC3's : They were made with NTSC in mind with a internal divider by 133.6666 instead of having something more flexible that could work in PAL. 
<br />
<br />Again, everyone forget about PAL and consider everyone live in a NTSC territory despite the fact that only a couple of countries uses that older standard while the rest of the world uses PAL, and glorify Konami for their so called awesome mappers.

Some places got fucked because the british controlled their area. But some places like Japan thankfully were rebuilt by the US and used NTSC. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />Btw, PAL back in the day blows ass. 50hz? No thanks. You say more lines of resolution and better color encoding? It wasn't needed.

<br />Yeah, seriously, what the hell is that all about? It sucks that some regions are just stuck being 50hz ones, when 60hz is honestly just plain better. Though PAL NES has the NTSC version beat with super extended Vblank... That's just awfully tempting sometimes.

I did not choose to be born in a PAL country, and honnestly there is no better among 50 or 60 Hz, it's just not compatible. With interlace 50Hz looks flickering, but without interlace it doesn't make any difference for games that were ported right.
<br />
<br />It's just a pain that japan took the NTSC way. If japan were a PAL country, most games were programmed with PAL in mind and it would be to the US to be left away for gaming while Europe would get everything, but oh well.

<br />
<br />Bach in the '50s the TVs had to refresh at the same freqency than the AC of power supply because the power fupply was badly filtered, and the AC leaked into the whole circuit. This would lead some part of the screen to be more luminous than others, but since it was always on sync that didn't matter, if it weren't on sync the more luminous part would "roll" on the screen and that would look horrible. Anyway that was fixed by isolating and filtering hte power supplies proprely before the video games came.
