<br />I ordered stuff from him 3 months ago which was never received. After being as nice as possible and numerous attempts to contact him I have never received a reply.
<br />
<br />I want to know why this guy won't communicate with me. I want to know why he won't send me what I ordered.
<br />
<br />All of my previous attempts at corresponding with him were delivered with respect, I truly admire what this guy does and have no personal hard feelings. This is just business. But I wonder what is going on here? 
<br />
<br />I even dismissed the fact that I never received what I ordered months ago
<br />and just wanted to establish contact so that I can order more stuff from him. Talk about trying to be nice...
<br />
<br />I don't even care about receiving what I ordered, a friendly e-mail and explanation would be great.

<br />
<br />Yes it got posted and I was charged (i.e., I paid for it and never received). For some strange reason this guy won't talk to me.
<br />
<br />Actually opened a "dispute" with PayPal after 2 month went by and only after numerous attempts to contact him. That was only an attempt to establish communication with him and buy more of his stuff, even though I never received what I originally ordered.
<br />
<br />I let the dispute expire because I didn't want to be an asshole about this.
<br />
<br />Tried via e-mail a dozen times, using alternate e-mail addresses, tried through PayPal, his phone number was not in service and he never responded to the PayPal dispute. Tried through NESdev forum, sending a friendly private message and posting a friendly message in the forum.
<br />
<br />I also tried, as a last ditch effort to have someone who knows him, e-mail him for me. I was told there was no reply.
<br />
<br />Everyone else has never had a problem, everyone else has received what they ordered and are able to communicate with him. Why not me?
<br />
<br />I don't care about losing my money, I do however wonder why in all my efforts I can't even get a response, an explanation or a friendly apology.
<br />
<br />I have never spoken to the guy, never met him before or ever had any kind of dialog with him. If he has something against me, then why accept my money?
<br />
<br />I really only wanted to buy more of his stuff.

<br />
<br />I didn't care about not receiving what I bought. Maybe it did get lost. My complaint is that I and a couple of other people who have tried to contact him on my behalf can't get any kind of response at all. I've been trying since April.
<br />
<br />I tried contacting via 2 different e-mail addresses, call the phone number listed in his PayPal sellers account, sent a private message here, posted twice here, had other people who know him e-mail for me. Had someone try to contact him yesterday via IRC and this guy told me he was "blocked" from communicating with him via IRC. Why would that guy be blocked?
<br />
<br />Every message was friendly and understanding explaining that I just wanted to be able to buy more of his stuff.
<br />
<br />I make and sell stuff too. Sometimes I am <em>really</em> late on orders, but I stay in constant contact with my customers. So I can completely understand when mistakes happen, but avoiding someone who is as nice as I am is not understandable at all.
<br />
<br />So I'm just going to drop it now because it's apparent to me that something else is going on here and I don't want to pursue something as weird as this has become. (I don't have any hard feeling towards the guy.)
<br />
<br />I'm not going to try to contact him anymore, nor will I bring it up again. This will be the last of my posts to this thread.
<br />
<br />Tony
