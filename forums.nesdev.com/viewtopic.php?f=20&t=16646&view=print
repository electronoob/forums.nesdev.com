		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So i of course broke the HSYNC signal for my Gameboy (hardware, not talking about emulator here).<br />Probably i might have touched other pins at the same time, or i grounded it wrong or something (noob at electricity).<br /><br />What's weird is that everything else works, i can actually get an image if i grab the signals and decode them myself (by just ensuring it's 144x160).<br />And the audio is fine as well.<br /><br />So it seems nothing is broken internally, but there's just no HSYNC signal at all from what i can see, and it makes no sense if it actually broke some chip as then i would assume some other stuff or the entire thing would break.<br /><br />So i wonder if it might just be some component (capacitor or whatnot).<br /><br />Hence asking here as ppl hare quite familiar with the hardware and might give tips on how i can troubleshoot:)<br /><br />Anything is helpful, i don't have high expectations of it being fixable, but i also don't think it's completely broken either.<br /><br />Thanks:)!

Repairable, but depending on where could require some very specialized equipment.<br /><br />2- You destroyed the pin driver. You *might* have destroyed only one of the pullup or pulldown; try adding a large resistor from the pin to +5V (or to gnd if the pin is instead always high)

Consists of a big nMOSFET and a pMOSFET. Not directly repairable.<br /><br />As I was saying, it's possible (given that the rest of the CPU is working correctly) that only one of these two MOSFETs is damaged. If so, adding a small current source (i.e. resistor) to replace the broken MOSFET would allow you to exchange a little more power consumption for a valid digital signal out.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A MOSFET is a device that acts like a little switch.<br /><br />Each of the outputs of the DMG are conceptually something something like this: <br /><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DPDT_knife_switch_in_closed_position.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/DPDT_knife_switch_in_closed_position.jpg/320px-DPDT_knife_switch_in_closed_position.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />When the pMOSFET is on, the switch is to one side, and the pin is pulled high. When the nMOSFET is on, the switch is to the other side, and the pin is pulled low. The thing I'm suggesting is <em>perhaps</em>, if you're lucky, only one side of the contacts are broken.<br /><br />If so, a resistor would then make it act something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_resistor" class="postlink">a pull-up resistor</a> (or its logical inverse, a pull-down resistor). The resistor is always &quot;on&quot;, but only a little, and much more weakly than the MOSFETs themselves can pull the pin high or low. (Obviously, you need to choose the correct size of resistor for that to work)

You just have to choose a value of resistance that is large enough to not overly tax the other MOSFET, but small enough that the output voltages still change fast enough.

(All the grounds inside the DMG are the same; just be careful to avoid the -19V from the flyback converter)<br /><br />Once the resistor is installed, measure both the DC and AC voltages on the HSYNC pin. If the DC voltage is neither 0V nor 5V, and the AC voltage is not 0V, then great! One of the two output transistors still works.<br /><br /><br />If you are now getting a signal, the next thing is just adjusting the resistor so that you can get a useful digital signal for whatever's afterwards. An oscilloscope would make this part easier; then you could actually literally just watch the HSYNC pin and see if it got high/low enough fast enough. Otherwise, you kind of have to guess (e.g. does your voltmeter provide a &quot;true&quot; RMS voltage?)
