This way an emulator doesn't need any special handling, other than doctoring the initial values of those zero-page locations before powering up the emulated NES. To change tracks, you repeat the above process. So you never need to know anything about how the music code works, where its routines are, etc. and the music code has full flexibility in how it works, and what mapper it uses. This of course would supplement NSF, rather than replace it, since NSF works fine for most music.<br /><br />That covers the essential functionality. You could also have the info strings at the beginning of PRG data, so that they are always at offset $10 in the file. And you could have some way of plugging in a NES-based UI, so that it can be booted standalone on a NES. Perhaps the reset code would check for a signature in zero-page; if not present, it jumps to an area where the NES-based front-end can be plugged in, and also specifies routines similar to NSF for changing the track while running.</div>
<br />I want to make this happen. I have been trying to get my tracker (Pornotracker) to a state where I could release it (I was supposed to release it 3 years ago). It supports raw PCM so exporting to NSF alone isn't going to work. I'll ship the specification with it so hopefully more people will adopt the format in the future.
<br />
<br />Let's see what we have here:
<br />- the emulator (or PowerPak or whatever) and the ROM communicate through zero page variables
<br />- the music header sits at the beginning of the ROM ($10 in the file)
<br />- before reset the emulator sets the track number and a signature on ZP, allowing the ROM to know if the emulator supplies an interface for playback control
<br />- when the user changes the CPU is reset (after rewriting the signature and track number)
<br />- use the .nes file extension or define a new one?
<br />
<br />What's in the header:
<br />- a signature string (to tell the emulator it's a music file)
<br />- version number
<br />- number of songs
<br />- starting song
<br />- PAL/NTSC/both flag
<br />- title of the song/artist/other info in string format
<br />- track names/length information
<br />
<br />Some of the header info should be optional.
<br />
<br />Suggestions/comments? Can you think of something else that should be included in the header?

<br />By using a standard NSF header, current NSF parsing code can be reused with minor modifications. Might simplify things. Obviously some of the fields wouldn't be used by the player.
<br /> 
<br />For NSF players being modified to support this, it could be allowed that the PPU only supports bit 7 of $2000 (and possibly $2002), nothing more, so the NSF player doesn't have to implement a lot of extra stuff. Might also specify a set of core mappers that every player should support.
<br />
<br />To help OS, music ROMs could have a different file extension, but .nes ones should be supported. Benefit of .nes extension is that current NES emulators can play them just fine.

<br />Which would rule out using sprite 0 for 120 Hz updates.
<br />
<br />The extension could be "iNSF", and the signature could be "NESM" which matches the first bytes of PRG ROM.
<br />
<br />Dual-compatible NTSC/PAL songs would have to wait a frame to detect the video system.
<br />
<br />How would timing work? Perhaps $2007 could be repurposed as a way for the program to tell the player software the name of the playing track and how long the track is. (This info is not in the NSF header.)
<br />
<br />Game soundtracks ripped into iNSF would have to relocate some code if they already have something at $8000-$807F.

To change tracks, it just resets the ROM with the new track number in zero-page. Meta-information goes in the header. Yes, it lacks per-track names and times, as NSF does.

Separate issue though, unrelated to the core one: NES music files that can use all NES features.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Game soundtracks ripped into iNSF would have to relocate some code if they already have something at $8000-$807F.</div>
<br />This isn't a replacement of NSF, at least not right now.
<br />
<br />I desire to keep this really minimal and simple. Basically, how can we support all NES features for music, with minimal emulator changes and complexity?

<br />
<br />As for track names, I personally think the ROM format shouldn't have any meta-information. Leave that to a game music format-agnostic wrapper of some sort. The ROM should only serve one purpose: store the music player code in a way that can be easily emulated.

It would be mostly for organizing purposes, so that you could differentiate application ROM files from music files by looking at the filename.<br /><br />As for the meta-information... I'm undecided.

<br />True, most game tracks should still be ripped as NSFs, but there are some that would work better in this format.
<br />
<br />A lot of tough decisions to make.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />tepples, excellent point about meta-information. This was partly one reason I suggested an embedded NSF header, so that an embedded player could use the init/play addresses from it. 
<br />
<br />thefox, point taken about the header format, so it will not be in NSF format then. Let's try to allow separation of concerns between the information a player needs to play the music, and the meta-information (track length, name, etc.), so that we can focus on the information the player needs, that is, that which if not present would prevent playing it.
<br />
<br />For the required NES features, I realized that the default should be that an iNES music file requires a fully-accurate NES. Then we have flags that specify that it will work with lesser systems, for example a PPU that only supports $2000 bit 7, or $2002 bit 7.

<br />That is, a PPU that only supports sprite 0 hit where the upper-left pixel of the sprite is always hitting a background pixel. Trivial to implement while giving the full benefit.
<br />
<br />Sprite overflow where the first 9 sprites must be the ones that trigger it, allowing a simple implementation. Also require that sprite transfers be done with DMA and always with SPRADDR=0 when beginning DMA, further simplifying without limiting anything.
<br />
<br />CHR ROM/RAM and $2006/$2007. I could imagine a music engine using this as a general-purpose buffer with automatic increment. Especially useful as an 8K sample buffer (or even 10K if you spilled into nametable). Couple with a mapper that switches CHR banks and you have space for PCM samples separate from PRG.
<br />
<br />$2002 bit 7 that is set each frame and cleared when read, but without any special cases or NMI suppression since those take a significant amount of code to implement properly.
<br />
<br />$2000 bit 7 where enabling in middle of VBL when flag is still doesn't cause second NMI.
<br />
<br />One feature that especially a full-accuracy iNES music player should support is hooking the audio to the composite video output <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
