(I mean, does the change happen immediately when the overlapping pixels are detected?)<br /></div><br />This depend of your programm. Sprite zero hit doesn't make anything scrolling, it just helps a lot to TIME your programm.<br />The NES doesn't have any HDMAs or anything : you cannot just tell to the NES : Scroll background = 0 before the hit and ScrollFieldX after hit. You have to set the scroll to 0, wait the hit, and then rewrite ScrollFieldX after that in your scrolling register.<br />So you can use it for scrolling or whathever, or just wait a little more constant time until you upload the scrolling if you want to do so (looks like it is what SMB does).<br /><br />Now, at the time you first write to $2005, as my undestanding, this will affect the horizontal scrolling immediately. To change vertical scrolling, you have to play with both $2005 and $2006 registers ($2006 is basically for adress, but during rendering it serves to adress tiles to render inside the screen). This is incredibly absurd and horrible to understand, and myself I've only understood half of that stuff (just enough to make some working mid-frame vertical scrolling in my game after loads of tries). Fortunatly, as long as you just scroll horizontally, things keeps simple.<br /><br />Note that sprite zero hit isn't limited to scrolling. Actually, you'll have to use it for almost all effects changing anything midframe. You can change the scrolling each scanline inside a timed loop to have various wavy effects, change the colour emphasis or monochrome bit mid-frame and even mid-scanline, turn either BG or sprites (or even both) on and off, turn the left clipping on and off (while I haven't found any interesting use of this), change pattern table used for either BG or sprites, change name table used (this often comes together with horizontal scrolling). You can even turn the whole screen off during some scanline to write stuff to PPU memory through $2006/7 (such as the palette or re-do sprite DMA to have 2 regions with 256 sprites available) and turn the screen back, but this is hard to do proprely and doesn't make much sense in my opinion.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Oct 15, 2006 9:38 am</p><hr />

Thanks Memblers, that does help. But now I've confused myself in a different way...<br /><br />The text in the SMB status bar is made up of background tiles right? If the coin is sprite 0, why doesn't the text to the right of the coin scroll along with the rest of the screen? Then again, isn't the blue color the transparent background color? If the coin is always on top of the transparent background color, how is the hit flag ever set? Or, is there something behind the coin that isn't transparent?<br /><br />I would have thought that if you wanted the top two 8px rows of the screen to remain stationary, you would have Sprite 0 placed so its top left pixel was at the top left of the third row on top of a non-transparent background tile and then have the scroll set to 0 until the hit flag was set. Wouldn't that make the top two rows remain stationary?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1242">oxymoron</a> — Sun Oct 15, 2006 3:57 am</p><hr />

Yeah, you've got the basic idea of how it can be used.  It's pretty generic and you can use it for anything, though only once per frame.<br /><br />What it is exactly, is an easy way to time your code so you can do something in the middle of the screen (or wherever you place sprite #0 overlapping something).<br /><br />So in Super Mario Bros for example, in the NMI routine it'd set the horizontal scroll to zero.  After it does any other stuff needed, it'd wait for the sprite zero hit to happen.  Then it would write the actual horizontal scroll, so the lower part of the screen will scroll.  And just loops doing that.<br /><br />BTW, sprite #0 in SMB is the coin graphic on the status bar.<br /><br />Here's the code I use to wait for sprite 0 hit:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">        lda #$40<br />:<br />        bit $2002<br />        beq :-<br /></div><br /><br />Let me know if that clarifies things or not.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Oct 15, 2006 1:18 am</p><hr />

I've been reading documents that briefly discuss Sprite 0 but I don't understand what it actually does. I read somewhere that this is how the status information in Super Mario Bros. stays in one place while the screen scrolls? Is it that nothing on the screen is altered until the Hit Flag is set? Like, if the screen was scrolling to the right and Sprite 0 was in the third row of the screen and the top left pixel of Sprite 0 was on top of an opaque background pixel, would everything above that stay where it was before? That might very well be stupid but I've been searching for an explination for a while and I can't find one.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1242">oxymoron</a> — Sun Oct 15, 2006 12:15 am</p><hr />
