A day in DRW's life: &quot;I'm bored, I want to play some cool NES games I have never played before. Let me think of a type of game I like, and then I'll introduce all these arbitrary limitations based purely on my personal taste and see if those suckers at NESDEV can come up with some good titles for me.&quot; <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />Hey, I'm all for discovering new games, and when a console has so many games as the NES does, the chances of there being some obscure gems are pretty high, but requesting lists with these ridiculously specific and arbitrary requirements? Is this really the best way to look for new games? If you have time one day, maybe you should grab one of those complete ROM sets of 6000+ files and open one by one and take note of whatever catches your attention. With newer games this would be a bad approach because there's so much crap before the actual gameplay starts, but it might just work for the NES.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Dec 11, 2013 10:23 am</p><hr />

I don't see how Bubble Bobble is different from Balloon Fight or Mario Bros. Defeat all enemies, get to the next level. Are you hatin' on it because it has a credit roll? Does it have too many levels? Too few? The exclusion seems arbitrary.<br /><br />Ice Climber counts despite its goal of scaling all the mountains?<br /><br />Is Snow Bros. too goal oriented like Bubble Bobble?<br /><br />Does Donkey Kong Jr. Math count? It's almost like a sports game, you're not exactly competing for a score, and &quot;defeating&quot; by making the other player get killed doesn't help.<br /><br />Joust must count if Balloon Fight does.<br /><br />Marble Madness is probably not top-down enough, nor standard enough. <br /><br />Does Smash T.V. have too much of a goal?<br /><br />I mean... no sports games is one thing, but no anything that's too bizarre? What's that mean? How much of a goal is too much? I really, really don't get these lists. It seems like it'd be so much easier for you to just find a complete list of two player simultaneous games and run down it for such a narrow guidelines.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Wed Dec 11, 2013 10:08 am</p><hr />

I'm looking for some NES/Famicom games that can be played by two players simultaneously.<br /><br />I'm thinking about some small, simple, infinite-loop high score games. Like &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; or &quot;Balloon Fight&quot;. Not something with an actual goal like &quot;Contra&quot; or &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot;.<br />Where you can compete with each other for score, but where it's not your goal to actively defeat the other player. (So, no games like &quot;Bomberman&quot;, &quot;Soccer&quot; or a fighting game.)<br /><br />And I'm looking for games with typical &quot;standard&quot; gameplay. No puzzle, sport, &quot;Breakout&quot;- or &quot;Pole Position&quot;-like games or anything that's too bizarre. I'm thinking more of a game where you control a character in a sideview or top-down level and where there are opponents and stuff.<br /><br />Do you know any of these?<br />Famicom-only games are also welcome.<br /><br />I already know:<br />&quot;Clu Clu Land&quot;<br />&quot;Ice Climber&quot;<br />&quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; unlicensed version<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6156">DRW</a> — Wed Dec 11, 2013 6:58 am</p><hr />
