But most Famicom games with battery backup comes with an orange paper that tells you to always hold reset when powering off among other warnings. Also most RPGs with battery backup has this in-game warning when saving and quitting.<br /><br />It's in Japanese but here is a screenshot of the warning in DQIII or IV (I think): <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.livedoor.jp/suzukiko/archives/51499457.html">http://blog.livedoor.jp/suzukiko/archives/51499457.html</a><!-- m -->

I imagine he'd have noticed that if it was there anyway.<br /><br />If I recall correctly the problem is a combination of the CPU being in an unreliable state (accessing random addresses) combined with NES cartridges having to resort to weird methods to write to save RAM (since they didn't check if it was a write access or not). This made them way more likely to respond to spurious accesses.<br /><br />In other words, if you want to get rid of this problem for real, you'd need to mess with the mappers in each cartridge, not with the console.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It might be possible to mod a game to remove the need to hold reset by modding the game to use something that doesn't respond to accidental writes. One method involves putting in a bigger flash memory, making PRG writable, and storing saved games in a log-structured file system in the otherwise unused space. Flash memory has built-in protection against stray writes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have an idea...<br /><br />Put an extra switch (like a reset button from an extra NES) inside the case of the NES, as close to the 'on/off' switch as possible, so that it sits under the large cap on the switch (the thing you press) in a way that when you press the on button both switches are tripped.<br />Since you push in both to turn it on and off, this would ensure that a signal would be sent from it when you hit the button. Connect the new switch to ground on one side (if you need to know a place to ground it to, pin 8 on the CIC is a convenient location). Connect the other side of the switch to the CIC on a reset pin.<br />I'm not sure which one of these will work, because IIRC, there's inverse logic on at least one of the following pins. My different project worked for me on pin 10. Maybe my lo\gic was inverted. :p The other pins to try are 7 and 9 - I think 7 is the one connected to the reset pin, so try that if in doubt.<br /><br />Now when you hit the power switch it will press inwards, triggering your new reset button. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />A bit of a cheap and dirty solution, but it's the simplest thing that popped into my head, relying on the physical pressing of the switch. I hope you find something that works!<br /><br /><br />P.S. - while I ruined my NES top loader at least 10 years ago, I clearly remember losing save data by failing to hold reset (which was broken on my top loader, anyway.)<br /><br />I broke it when the reset button was rusted down and while trying to repair it I shorted something. I was 10; give me a break. I kept it and will be replacing every chip on the thing with the parts from a toaster, and a new reset button when I find a broken SNES or find the part for sale somewhere, but I don't know what to look for.<br /><br />By the way, if anyone knows where to find that reset button part (same as on a SNES), that would be great.

Or if there is one (the Japanese tended to invent new words during the war when loanwords were shunned), most Japanese people would probably not understand it anyway.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I believe that the first katakana should be RI, not RE.</div><br />Oh dear, horrible american accent transcribed in katakanas <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br />Why not ウイサット while they're at it !<br /></div><br />I believe it's pronounced [risett] in British English too. English never had the spelling reforms that most European languages had so there's tons of exceptions in the spelling rules. I understand that it's good to preserve the history, but this is a PITA for the rest of the world that has to learn the language. lol

I didn't translate it literally because that wouldn't make any sense. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://jisho.org/words?jap=otukaresama&amp;eng=&amp;dict=edict">http://jisho.org/words?jap=otukaresama&amp;eng=&amp;dict=edict</a><!-- m --><br /><br />There's no conditional form of any verb (Japanese &quot;if&quot;) anywhere so we can't put in an &quot;if&quot; there. Kiri means &quot;cutting&quot; as you say and literary it would become &quot;please cut the power&quot;.&quot; Kono mama&quot; means &quot;this condition/state&quot; so translating it to &quot;now&quot; is totally OK in my book. If you want to go further you could even say &quot;It's OK to turn off the power now&quot;, but that would be a lot less literal.<br /><br />I'm quite picky about not get things lost in translation so I'm usually very literal when I translate Japanese, but nowdays I have gotten a bit more practical and try to aim more for proper English while still trying to preserve everything.
