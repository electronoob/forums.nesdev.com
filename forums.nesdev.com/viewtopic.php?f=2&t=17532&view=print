		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Second topic<br /><br />&quot;I want to see Chip-8 on NES so that I can extend an emulator stack one higher. Imagine Chip-8 emulator in PocketNES in VisualBoyAdvance GX in Dolphin in Wine in Virtual PC or VMware.&quot; - tepples<br /><br />2 of the main problems I can think of are:<br />1) Screen resolution- Easy to solve, just have 16 tiles with all possible values of 4 bits to simulate 4x4 tiles<br /><br />2) Memory- Without expansion RAM, the NES only has 2KB of RAM and CHIP-8 has 4KB. However, we can get an extra kilobyte from the unused nametable, and almost 512 bytes from the fact that some of the main nametable is unused. We can solve the garbage data with forced blanking (timed with sprite 0 hits and timed code) and get more time to read and write to the to the PPU midframe and use OAM memory (disabling sprites) or attribute tables (duplicating palettes) for the rest. Hopefully this will give us 3.5 KB, and 512 bytes are reserved for the interpreter on CHIP-8 so that should be enough. I haven't worked out the numbers so I may be wrong. We can get more memory for the interpreter by duplicating tiles 16 times, so we can used the unused 4 bits to get more RAM for the interpreter. We only need to emulate 9 cycles per frame (540Hz), so there should be enough time.<br /><br />Thoughts?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Another problem:<br />3) Input- The CHIP-8 (or is Chip-8?) has a 16-key hex keyboard whereas the NES controller only has 8 buttons. An obvious solution would be to have a screen for mapping NES controller buttons to CHIP-8 keys, or use 2 controllers. Another way would be to use button combinations or modifier button (if NES A is pressed, NES B means  CHIP-8 5, but otherwise it means CHIP-8 F).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can't seem to find information about it (maybe the original pages are gone?), but a long time ago I remember reading about a CHIP-8 emulator for the Vectrex, which has even less RAM, and it ran into the lack of memory problem too.<br /><br />The author of that emulator made the realization that most games treat most of the address space as read-only, aside from some games like the Pac-Man clone (Blinky), and you could put the addresses actually treated as RAM in RAM while the rest went in ROM. That requires looking at how each game works, but CHIP-8 games are so simple that it's probably not very hard.<br /><br />Edit: found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101220095143/http://www.revival-studios.com/?page=33" class="postlink">some information</a> on that via Internet Archive, though it's mostly just confirming what I remembered

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have considered making a CHIP-8 emulator for the NES many times, but the lack of interesting CHIP-8 games to play ends up discouraging me. Most of the games look too glitchy to be fun, IMO. If there was a cool platformer with smooth physics for the CHIP-8, I'd feel much more compelled to write an emulator. The original CHIP-8 looks fairly easy to implement, but I definitely wouldn't use this absurd memory layout, I'd just use extra RAM.

It definitely isn't CPU cycles as we're used to measuring on the NES, because 540 instructions per second (assuming each instruction is one cycle) isn't nearly enough to make a game with any sort of real time interaction.

I just realised that attribute data is not extra data as it is included in the name table RAM. Anyway it's fun, cheaper to make a cartridge out of and more impressive that way.
