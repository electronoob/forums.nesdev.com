What follows after the 128-byte header is a NES program that contains the code and data needed to play all the songs in that NSF. What the code and data looks like depends on who wrote it, so it will differ a lot between games made by different companies (and sometimes between different games made by the same company).<br />Like someone suggested early on in the thread, if you want to make a single-song NSF from an existing NSF the only universal way to do so is to inject a machine code sequence at the init address that sets the A and X registers to the song number that you want.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1181">mic_</a> — Mon Aug 10, 2009 9:26 am</p><hr />

Your only real bet to get all the data is to run it for about 7 minutes and hope you get all the song data.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">arthurln wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />3.

You'd often have to remove an existing track from the set as well.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">arthurln wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />4. Every file's end are differences. Is that means that there is no specified  end format and only header and data.<br /></div><br /><br />This is simple. If you optimize data, and remove the unused stuff, you can just cut it off the end. If the last byte in the file is 00, you can remove that byte. Repeat until last byte != 00. When you optimize, any unused data is set to 00.<br /><br /><br />Beyond answering specific questions, I should mention that optimizing single songs isn't very useful. Separation of songs from an NSF can go wrong. Space used by an NSF increases as you copy data with required null data in it, with this null data duplicated across several NSF files. If you're desperate to have individual tracks, it can be done with NotsoFatso or even NEZPlug, I think. For NotsoFatso, right-click the file in the winamp playlist you want as single-track entries, go to the 'View File Info' option, then 'Shadow -&gt; Winamp' for a playlist of the nsf in winamp, or 'Shadow -&gt; File' to export a playlist you can play for individual tracks.<br /><br />Either way, do as you wish. I just see a way around this if I was interested in having some individual-track playlists.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=229">ugetab</a> — Mon Aug 10, 2009 6:29 am</p><hr />

There is no "Extraction", you just append a fragment of code to do "LDA #xx" at the beginning of the code, then jump to the proper init address.  Then you have a NSF identical to the original, except it ignores the user supplied track number, and only plays that one specific track.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Sun Aug 09, 2009 7:02 am</p><hr />

Hi,<br />I want to write a program which can extract each track into a single file from a multi-track NSF file.<br />I know there is a software in Windows that can do the same thing but I just want to write one myself.<br />Please let me know if there is any open-source library can help me do that. And any related documents will help too.<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4006">arthurln</a> — Sun Aug 09, 2009 2:05 am</p><hr />
