Also, it's a wiki: Edit it if you find broken stuff.</div><br />A lot of images and files are broken or missing, and you can't find them in search. For example, check out this page:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://wiki.superfamicom.org/schematics-ports-and-pinouts">https://wiki.superfamicom.org/schematic ... nd-pinouts</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The images and PDFs near the top aren't discoverable through the site search, nor are they available at their original URLs. For example, this link:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://wiki.superfamicom.org/snes/files/snes_schematic_color.pdf">https://wiki.superfamicom.org/snes/file ... _color.pdf</a><!-- m --><br /><br />gives you this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Cannot GET /snes/files/snes_schematic_color.pdf</div><br />I'm not sure why you're defending these changes. This is a regression, pure and simple. A lot of the text content is there, but it's worse for the update. Links are broken. Images and files are missing. The maintainer of the wiki should have tested the new backend before committing a bunch of breaking changes.

I'm just reporting a high-impact bug.<br /><br />I do apologize if I'm coming off icy, though. At the company I work at, we have a culture of writing &quot;postmortems,&quot; in which we analyze and document the root causes of development or operations issues to make sure they don't happen again. These analyses tend to be impersonal and matter-of-fact: here's what broke, here's why, and here's what we can do to fix it in the short term and in the long term. That's the mode I'm in here.<br /><br />In any event, thank you for letting the site maintainer know about the issues.

But it would help a lot if whoever manages the site software were a regular here so we'd have a better idea of what's going on.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just wrote a lot of new information on the &quot;optimization&quot; section about memory hierarchies.  I would need to rewrite the last section of the page because the new section makes the section at the bottom of the page sound almost contradictory, because it explains how much the Direct Page can speed up code, and then it says not to move stuff in and out of the Direct Page.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />I rewrote the bottom section too, so that it's less confusing.  I hope this <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://wiki.superfamicom.org/general-advice">https://wiki.superfamicom.org/general-advice</a><!-- m --> persuades people into realizing how powerful the 65816 actually is when you know how to use it.<br /><br />I should make a section about the &quot;little address self-fulfilling prophecy&quot; where a 512 byte table of self-pointing addresses will automatically shrink down to 256 bytes if you use 8-bit addresses.

Unsure), which means the certificate auto-expires every 90 days.  This requires the server administrator set up some automation to renew it automatically at about the 60-75 day mark.</div><br />Not only does the actual certificate have to be renewed, the HTTP server has to be told to reload its configuration (at least, in nginx). This is the issue I ran into specifically. This is fixed by specifying a renew-hook in the cron job's commandline.
