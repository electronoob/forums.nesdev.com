The OP starts with a somewhat arrogant tone (probably I'm the only one to see because I posted diagrams, including a 257 one, in the thread referenced), then I was replied to with ellipsis, bolded keywords and datasheet parameters. This is an aggressive, argumentative writing style that asserts fact/superiority. Whatever, it's not a big deal, just off-putting for me, someone initially trying to help, not defend my posts.
<br />
<br />To put it simply magno, it appears you have /RD and /ROMSEL confused. This is common and persists because of siudym's pinouts. (It looks like he fixed the cartridge pinout but I guess the mask ROM reflects the old one). You may have better results if you exchange them.
<br />
<br />It has been my experience after looking at dozens of systems, including the SNES, that ROMs are usually enabled by an address decoder such as /ROMSEL. Both CPU and ROM setup times are designed around this arrangement so using it is the most efficient in terms of power and access time (not so much with the 816 if /RD is asserted throughout the access period, but absolutely critical in other systems).
<br />
<br />Yes, /RD is negligible here, but it's because (/OE || /CE)  to valid data is generally &lt;50ns (+ the time to decode /RD from R//W and E or whatever assuming unmodified CPU) and long before the /CE-reliant row/column decoders have finished.
<br />
<br />There is no question that the default address decoder is /ROMSEL and that the MAD-1 and 139 circuits further decode /ROMSEL. That's why I have proposed these arguments cause for investigation:
<br />
<br />-whether /ROMSEL is predecoded before the address latch (unlikely but it would probably save 20ns)
<br />-whether the later mask ROMs are really 120ns since there is probably 40ns of decoding delay between /ROMSEL and the MAD-1 (I personally haven't seen a Nintendo mask ROM with a clear speed grade but I can take magno's word for it to refute the &lt;120ns proposition)
<br />
<br />OR (here's a new one)
<br />
<br />-whether data really is latched 140ns from the address being valid/end of the clock phase; we're assuming (1 / (21477272.727 / 6)) / 2 or an access time of 139.683ns for "FastROM". Well, IIRC Nintendo recommends 200ns for "SlowROM" whose reciprocal clock would be 2.5 MHz, obviously not suitable for 2.68 MHz operation without even taking address decoding into consideration. There must be a wait state or something else to the access times.

<br />
<br />Of course your understanding of /RD (/OE) and /ROMSEL (/CE) is correct, but it conflicts with what you posted earlier and with the cartridge diagram.
<br />
<br />If you have the hardware setup for testing, why not test the MAD-1 and access period yourself? Surely you can measure it down to 5ns resolution.

<br />
<br />All you need is the MAD-1 delay by itself, /ROMSEL's delay can be measured by sampling from A23:15 stable to /ROMSEL asserted. If the lower address bits are stable long before A23:16 we know Nintendo used an edge triggered register. If /ROMSEL changes with A23:16 it's predecoded.
<br />
<br />I'm really tired so I shouldn't have posted that about the bank address. I thought about it and if Nintendo used a transparent latch instead of register, predecoding wouldn't even be necessary and pretty much all address decoding would occur within Phi1 or a few ns into Phi2 &gt;.&lt; This could be the case and solve the SlowROM mystery too but it cuts things really close. (I think tepples is onto something with asymmetrical duty-cycles.)

<br />
<br />I got the pinout here:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://nintendoallstars.w.interia.pl/romlab/snesroms.htm" class="postlink">http://nintendoallstars.w.interia.pl/romlab/snesroms.htm</a>
<br />
<br />And yes, MaskROM's /OE is connected to MAD-1 pin 4, and MaskROM's /CS to /RD.
<br />
<br />I think that is the proper wiring, since /RD is asserted first of any other signal (a bit later than A23-A0) so MaskROMs is enabled at that moment. After that, /ROMSEL is asserted, but the MaskROM can't "see" that signal yet... /ROMSEL is decoded along bus address on the MAD-1, and then its pin 4 is asserted, pulling down MaskROM's /OE and enabling its output. When that occurs, probably the MaskROM hasn't got the data yet (because of its time access), but the output is already enabled, so we don't take into account "/OE to data valid" timing in the calculations.
<br />
<br />Am I wrong?

Just to be sure I verified that pin 24 is connected to /RD and that pin 33 is connected to /ROMSEL on a game without an address decoder. I have not verified that the functions are correct because this is the normal arrangement and the fact that /RD and /ROMSEL were confused in the past*, I don't see any reason to believe /RD is connected to /CE and /ROMSEL to /OE.
<br />
<br />*the ROM pinouts appear to be derived from cartridge wiring on the site, not actually measured, so I believe mask ROM /OE was only verified as being connected to /RD, which was thought to be "/CE" aka /ROMSEL in the old pinout. OK, I think I've gone on enough about this XD
<br />
<br />I understand how you think it should be but did you verify that your /OE pin is really /OE? Do you have the timings now? You can justify some reasoning behind it but it's pointless if the pinout is incorrect. Again all I have to go by is what is logical, I really don't want to spend the time building a circuit to test. I did open up a bootleg of Mortal Kombat II though which should be FastROM and its address decoder selected /CEs, not /OEs (verified because they have a JEDEC pinout). The ROM speeds are not on the packages but I still expect that this typical arrangement is also true for Nintendo ROMs.

<br />
<br />As for that, I don't think it sounds authoritative... in fact, it doesn't "sound"... I bolded all signal names because sometimes is really hard for non-english speakers to follow a conversation full of acronyms... I did it for comprehension's sake, now it is up to you believe it or not.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, I'm glad you agree now. No hard feelings!
<br />
<br />I believe the reason exchanging the signals still worked is because the 816 doesn't have picky timing. On another CPU, such as one with many cycles per fetch, /RD might only assert on the last state/phase of a cycle and asynchronously enabling the ROM any earlier could cause a bus conflict with internal operations.
<br />
<br />If it is true that Nintendo latches the bank address with a transparent latch, the address will be valid &lt;90ns into Phi1, /ROMSEL will assert maybe &lt;120ns into Phi1 and the 139/MAD-1 will assert &lt;20ns into Phi2 assuming FastROM. I chose 40ns for the 139 because sometimes the individual decoders are chained. This leaves the 120ns before data is sampled.
<br />
<br />On the other hand enabling the ROM with /RD starts in Phi2. /RD must be asserted &lt;30ns into Phi2 (it's probably decoded by R//W NAND Phi2) and the ROM data will be valid 120ns after that. Perhaps /RD is asserted 15ns into Phi2 which causes only ROMs faster than their rated 120ns to work when paired with a 15ns 257.
<br />
<br />In both proposed explanations the timings are conservative, there must be a little headroom or the working 257 circuit you built wouldn't work. IIRC the WDC datasheet says the address is valid after around 50ns @ 5V (+ ~20ns for the latch) so that could make room for a 257.

On another CPU, such as one with many cycles per fetch, /RD might only assert on the last state/phase of a cycle and asynchronously enabling the ROM any earlier could cause a bus conflict with internal operations.</div><br /><br />I have news about this...<br />This morning I finished my Chrono Trigger repro using 27C322 and two 74HC257. I followed your advice and did the following rewiring: <br /><br />* EPROM's /CS -&gt; "ROM /OE" from MAD-1<br />* EPROM's /OE -&gt; GND<br />* 74HC257's /OE -&gt; /RD<br /><br />But it didn't work... Right now I've opened the cartridge and rewired this way:<br /><br />* EPROM's /CS -&gt; /RD<br />* EPROM's /OE -&gt; GND<br />* 74HC257's /OE -&gt; "ROM /OE" from MAD-1<br /><br />And now IT WORKS! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> The 27C322 EPROM is -100ns speed grade...<br /><br />How could it be? What else am I missing?<br />Does it mean that /RD is asserted before /ROMSEL? That would explain timing is correct using /RD as EPROM enable because the data is available sooner than when using MAD-1's pin 4.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">kyuusaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If it is true that Nintendo latches the bank address with a transparent latch, the address will be valid &lt;90ns into Phi1, /ROMSEL will assert maybe &lt;120ns into Phi1 and the 139/MAD-1 will assert &lt;20ns into Phi2 assuming FastROM. I chose 40ns for the 139 because sometimes the individual decoders are chained. This leaves the 120ns before data is sampled.<br /><br />On the other hand enabling the ROM with /RD starts in Phi2. /RD must be asserted &lt;30ns into Phi2 (it's probably decoded by R//W NAND Phi2) and the ROM data will be valid 120ns after that. Perhaps /RD is asserted 15ns into Phi2 which causes only ROMs faster than their rated 120ns to work when paired with a 15ns 257.<br /><br />In both proposed explanations the timings are conservative, there must be a little headroom or the working 257 circuit you built wouldn't work. IIRC the WDC datasheet says the address is valid after around 50ns @ 5V (+ ~20ns for the latch) so that could make room for a 257.</div>
<br />
<br />I'll recheck 65C816's datasheet and will make some time diagrams to fully understand all these.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The reason the first way didn't work is because you are enabling the 257 with /RD. /RD is asserted on every memory read so you are trashing the bus. In the other thread I used a 139 decoder to create an OR gate (/ROMSEL OR /RD) which is the proper condition. I think you could change around the MAD-1 connections to get this condition too since both ROM decoders aren't used with a single ROM, just replace the "select" address line input with /RD.
<br />
<br />The transparent latch theory shows that /ROMSEL (and MAD-1 likely) will be asserted before /RD, I believe that's how it is.
