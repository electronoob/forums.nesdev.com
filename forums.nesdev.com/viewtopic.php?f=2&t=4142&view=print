		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi,
<br />
<br />Let me start by introducing myself!
<br />
<br />I'm a street artist who wants to make an NES 8-bit computer game.
<br />You can check out my stuff on <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.Bandit.es">www.Bandit.es</a><!-- w --> and more recently i participated in the Cans festival in London together with the best stencil artists in the field today organized by Banksy and pictures on walls.
<br />(pictures here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/9724757@N07/sets/72157604955391837/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/9724757@N0 ... 955391837/</a><!-- m --> )
<br />
<br />And i wanted to see here if there are any people who want to (and can) make a computer game for NES which you will get payed for! (an advance and monthly or as the project progresses)
<br />So no "favors" asked but skills and know-how
<br />
<br />The game would get a real release on new NES carts,the ones you can buy online, have real packaging, a manual.. etc.
<br />
<br />I'm new to NES programming,and in fact i would just be the project director/game designer and of course do artwork for the game.
<br />
<br />I can't stress enough that this is a very serious inquiry !
<br />So post only if really interested and if you have the skills.
<br />
<br />
<br />Thanks in advance.

<br />
<br />Is it really <em>that</em> serious anyway ? We already got a message like this once and the author claimed it was serious, but it wasn't as he never replied.
<br />If this is serious tell us one more thing or two about the project so that we can see more or less what it is about : I personally see no common point between NES programming and street art.
<br />
<br />By the way there seem to be a unlicenced developper in Spain that did a <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?publisher=Gluk%20Video" class="postlink">few games</a>. Have this anything to do with that ?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi Bregalad,
<br />
<br />The offer will be as serious as the advance people will get as soon as they sign on for the project =)
<br />
<br />Nobody is gonna start without seeing how real this is going to be.
<br />
<br />First i felt i needed to know if this could be done, because i dont want to go through the trouble of figuring everything else out and then ending up here and having no dev team to make it.
<br />
<br />The link between streetart and 8-bit games will be made for the very first time,that's why you can't see it =)
<br />
<br />Let's face it,what is more bad-ass than a new NES computergame featuring world renown streetartists?
<br />
<br />More details about the project will come this week, because altho i have the game design roughly in my head i still have to make it into a solid concept and talk to the other street artists i want to include.
<br />
<br />Again, nobody is going to have to do any coding/designing  before they get an advance to show them my good and honest intentions.
<br />
<br />So i need to know how many people would i need,who they are and how much time it would take to make a sidescrolling/rpg game.
<br />
<br />Thanx again,

<br />EDIT: Oh, and also, how would one be paid? Via Paypal or something?

<br />I don't expect SNES or N64 graphics =) just a solid NES game.
<br />
<br />I think PayPal would be the easiest way to pay everyone yes.
<br />
<br />Later this week I'll pm everyone who is interested and start a new topic maybe to sort things out and give away more details.

But what I'm having trouble to see is serious is that you'd be ready to *pay* people with that. I mean I code a video game on the NES and I find this fun I don't mean to be paid for that. I doubt the cartridge would sell milions anyway but who knowns ?
<br />
<br />Now that you mention in there is the sprite of SMB3 painted on a wall in a big town near I live (among with other pictures) I find this very cool an it makes me in a good mod when I see the picture because it makes me think of SMB3.
<br />
<br />And yeah I like the picture that says "Don't tell me where to write and where not to" with a cute girl next to it. It sounds quite rebelious and I like that.
<br />
<br />Back to the project, I guess we should know more or less the type of the game and the size, to see how hard it would be to code. I personally have a top-down action/RPG game engine for ready to use for <a href="http://jonathan.microclub.ch/rainbow/en/drgskill.html" class="postlink">Dragon Skill</a> (beware outdated site). It could be modified to suit another project. Gravity could be added to make a plafrormer instead (in fact I'm secretly planning to do another game with it after the day I'll release Dragon Skill if that day ever comes).

<br />Unless it's going to be included on some multicart bundled with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System_hardware_clone" class="postlink">famiclones</a>. Once Wii and Virtual Console came out, Nintendo started to crack down harder on mall kiosks that sold famiclones bundled with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicart#Pirate_multicarts" class="postlink">illegally copied multicarts</a>. But a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handheld_TV_game" class="postlink">dedicated TV games</a> are based on some variant of NOAC (single-chip famiclone) tech bundled with non-infringing games.

<br />
<br />I know I'd like to learn more about this project. You said it was a side scroller featuring street artists, right? The "side scrolling" part is easy for me, as I've already completed a very fast 8-way scrolling engine for my Sonic game. Now, there must be something really unique about the "street artist" aspect that makes the game interesting, so the "key" must be somewhere else.
<br />
<br />I understand that you might not want to get into much detail about this for being afraid that someone might steal your ideas, but if you feel like you can share anything else, please do.
<br />
<br />Anyway, it seems like there are a few people interested in this, myself included, so how would you pick the right guys for the job? Lucky are the (few) ones that have some sort of portfolio on-line, I guess. Well, count me in for further discussion! =)

<br />And what about the thousand of posts I've seen you crying arround as you had big trouble to make your background scroll ? And now you said you did this easily ?
<br />
<br />The problem is that if you pay some people of NESdev to do this and not some other for no apparent reason, then it's a risk some people will be kind of jealous and will refuse to help/aid the project at all, and the people being paid with his other projects. With "no money involved" mentailty this wouldn't happen, as everyone would be glad to help a bit if they can, and in the end if you somehow make significan money with it share it in proportion of who did the most work overall. Making it sound all serious when in fact it's not goint to be all that serious is probably wrong as well. I canot imagine how loud my dad would laugt at me if I told him "Hey dad I found a summer job for this year I'm goint to code a NES game and be paid for it".
<br />
<br />Aside of that I'm of course interested in the project, especially considering the art is the most difficult part for me to do in my game. I'm basically an coder who has most abilities to do a video game but lacks ability to draw cool characters and monsters. After all being told what to do sounds a little more easier than desing all yourself.
<br />
<br />I'm make you notice how shameful it's coming here and say "hey gus you'll get $$$" and how it could increase rivality and decrease the mod of nes-devloppers.
