It's basically a USB-to-5V GPIO converter, with the gpio hooked up to a 72 pin connector.  I had PCB's made, but never bothered to solder down the electronics or write the software for it.  The real dealbreaker for me was the 72 pin connector, finding one of those is impossible.

<br />It's called Retrode, and the manufacturer isn't planning NES support any time soon because mapper autodetection is &lt;whine&gt;too hard&lt;/whine&gt;.

<br />I don't know that anyone has ever manufactured a CPU with enough IO, so I was using a PIC plus shift registers.  I didn't need 72 pins worth though, since the data and address lines for the CPU could be multiplexed with the PPU lines.  I figured I would never need to read from both CPU and PPU simultaneously.
<br />My goal was twofold:
<br />1. to dump carts
<br />2. to reprogram flash carts
<br />
<br />The schematics are pretty simple, though I would probably use Arduino if doing it over again today.  I would pick up and finish the project in a heartbeat if the mechanical side (specifically the 72 pin connector) weren't such a problem.  I've often wondered if it would be cost effective to spend a couple of thousand dollars to have a run of the connectors made.  I doubt there's much of a market for them, but over many years you might be able to sell all of them.  Maybe Kevin would buy a bunch for when he manufactures his KevTendo <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Edit: found my old schematic laying around.  I can take a photo of the pcb's too if anyone cares, they're sitting in a drawer somewhere.

<br />I know there technically is a difference in pitch but I tested out the connections and tried to slide the cart back and forth I couldn't get any of the connections to short or break contact.  The only place that there was enough free play to cause problems was on the mobo.  But you shouldn't be too concerned about that.

Is that the idea?</div>Yes, it is the idea; you are accessing the game directly from the cartridge, and no mapper detection is necessary (unless you write a program on your computer to dump the ROM, but in this case the mapper detection is part of the computer program and there is no need to include it in the USB device (although you might copy it to the USB filesystem if you commonly use it for that purpose)).

But you shouldn't be too concerned about that.<br /><br />I've been using my homemade 72 pin connector all week and I'm loving it.</div>
<br />
<br />I really would like to put an end to rumor that the 2.54mm pitch edge connectors work.  They don't.  I drew up a diagram of a 2.50mm edge, and also a 2.54mm edge to show the problem:
<br /><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/477050/nesedge.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />As you can see looking from left to right, the pitch difference starts to be a problem quickly.  By pin 22 you have a mathematically guaranteed contention.  You simply cannot have more than 22 pins in a row line up.  The difference in pitches is 0.04mm.  The space between pads is 0.882mm.  So, 0.882 / 0.04 = 22.05.  22 pins and you're screwed.
<br />
<br />But, you say, my connector is working fine and I have proof!  No, you don't.  You have contentions that aren't producing noticeable problems.  Why?  Because the conflicting pins aren't used.  Look at this picture of MMC3:
<br /><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/477050/mmc3pcb1.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />Lots of unused pins in the middle.  These are pins 16-20, which are Expansion[0-4].  On the reverse side of the board in the middle are Expansion[5-8]. Other carts do have pads for these pins, and could potentially use them,:
<br /><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/477050/cleaned.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />So, by sliding your cart back and forth you can shift around where the contention happens - but you cannot avoid it.  This will work for some carts,others it won't.  It certainly won't work for anything that uses the expansion pins.  It will not work at all for a project like mine - where all 72 pins need to be used (we were going to use the EXP pins as chip select and control for the flash on the devcarts).
<br />My original drawings (QCAD) are here if you'd like to check the measurements: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/477050/nes_edge_both.dxf" class="postlink">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/477050/nes_edge_both.dxf</a>
<br />
<br />Ben Heck confirmed the problem here:
<br /><a href="http://benheck.com/nes-micro" class="postlink">http://benheck.com/nes-micro</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this ends the ambiguity over these connectors.  They are not proper replacements for the original.  They may work for you, depending on your requirements, but will require positioning the cartridge <em>just right</em>.  If you mechanically set it up so that the contention is in the middle, you're mostly OK.  If not, you could short GND to VCC, and your cart and/or your console will release it's magical smoke.

<br />You could line them up at the middle instead, since there are less than 22 pins in each half, right?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I understand exactly what you're saying.
<br />
<br />The thing that really made these connectors work was the fact there was only .019" of free play.  So you're unable to slid the cart fully to the left and create the scenario seen in the picture you show.
<br />
<br />To prove it to myself I place a board with all 72 contacts removed from the case in my connector.  Then I tested for continuity and shorting between pins on both sides and the center while the board was slid from side to side.  By testing in this manner I can rule out the argument that my cart isn't using all the pins.  Now I didn't test every single pin in every single position because that I'd still be testing.  But I did test the extremes that have the best chance of causing issues.  If I didn't already have everything assembled I would be willing to do more tests to further prove things if someone desired.  If I buy more connectors in the future I will most likely do such just to prove even more so for myself.
<br />
<br />The only real way I see problems arising is if certain carts have different lengths of the board edge.  If the board was small enough you may be able short pins together or lose contact.  One could go through and measure various carts with a caliper if they were that concerned.
<br />
<br />As an aside I'm not necessarily trying to prove you "wrong" I agree there is potential for issues with these connectors.  And if you don't want to use them I'm not going to lose any sleep.  It's not like I'm trying to sell them to anyone.  After buying them I everyone informed me they wouldn't work and gave evidence on paper that they wouldn't.  At the time I regretted buying them and expected to return them.   But with some simple testing with the actual hardware I couldn't find any actual problems.  Personally I'm thrilled with them and very thankful that I actually tested things out and found a solution for at least myself, if no one wants to agree with my results that's fine.  They can continue to search for a solution.
