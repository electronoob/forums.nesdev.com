You don't have the obligation to fill the whole memory space and supply any vectors, the simulator will start running the first line of code automatically. You can override that using a &quot;start&quot; directive if you want to start execution somewhere else.<br /><br />I don't think the point here is to start out with a working NES ROM, but rather explain the basics of how assembly language works. Wrapping programs into a working ROM can come later on.

(which is crazy cool!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I never thought of doing that!) ...and was led to believe that he, the author guy, has not taught you what beq actually means.  For me <span style="color: #00BFFF">beq</span> is <span style="color: #00BFFF">b</span>ranch if <span style="color: #00BFFF">eq</span>uals zero.  Your <span style="color: #00FF00">; if equal go to &quot;theend&quot;</span> comment would be confusing if it wasn't preceded by a cpx. Yes... it is actually possible to use <span style="color: #00BFFF">beq</span> for any reason... like <div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">@b&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lda newControllerButtons&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;Is the B button down?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and #BUTTON_B ;01000000b<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beq @select</div><br />What that does is <span style="color: #FF0080">and</span> the accumulator with a binary value where only the 6th bit is set... then if that bit in the accumulator wasn't set (it equaling 0) then branching to @select...  I just wanted to make this clear to you or others that read your thread... <span style="color: #00BFFF">beq</span> is all about <span style="color: #00BFFF">b</span>ranching if <span style="color: #00BFFF">eq</span>uals zero.  And I must go... but I also want to say that it's very helpful to me that your <span style="color: #00FF00">; if equal go to &quot;theend&quot;</span> comment is actually true!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I plan on using your &quot;if equal go to ...&quot; idea if the <span style="color: #00BFFF">beq</span> is preceded by a compare. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

That sort of makes sense, though in that case I don't really understand the need for an .org directive... in any case, it's clear looking at the examples that they are kind of all nonsense examples that aren't practical pieces of code at all. Rather strange... I don't think this is a very useful way to learn.
