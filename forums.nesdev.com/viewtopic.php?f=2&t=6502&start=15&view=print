<br />I don't think so... his whole code is cycle timed and he doesn't even use any interrupts !!
<br />So basically had to write all his code so that it will take a constant # of cycles no matter of what it's doing, so basically it means no branches, etc... or if you use any assembly equivalent of if/else statement it's a headache to make both flows join again at the same timing.
<br />
<br />Since I don't know any music engine that execute in a constant # of cycles, no playing music just isn't possible here.

I'm guessing there is alot of free time during vblank, so it wouldn't even have to be very optimized aslong as it always use the same number of cycles.

<br />Looks great on NESICIDE.  Awesome demo!
<br />
<br />Back to debugging my DMC...
<br />
<br />This demo actually helped me find a bug in my PPU.  Turns out I wasn't masking the palette RAM with $3F on reads, which caused some pretty ghastly colors to appear [invalid memory...off of the end of my allocated palette RAM] in the bottom third of the screen.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I wanted to put a music engine in. This thing is using almost all time, though, because it has to recalculate a 200+ entry table every frame. I'm spending very little time delaying, maybe 200 cycles or so each frame. The graphics engine in this is <em>very</em> flexible. There is plenty I haven't done with it. All the tables are in RAM, and it does a lot of lookup during rendering, so you can quickly change things without having to rewrite a lot of tables.
<br />
<br />I <em>do</em> script some things, like the simplistic palette at the beginning dividing into twice as many colors, so you can see that effect from the start, then that palette having a wave transform it into a smoother one. I would have loved to have it start out all dorky simple looking, then some techno soundtrack start pumping while it went all crazy. If someone else wanted to work on a sequel with music and various events, I'm interested.
<br />
<br />I actually can do branches in the code. I had to develop some techniques to make it bearable. Many branch sequences clamp a value to a range. For example, to subtract 12 from A if it's &gt;= 12:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cmp #12<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bcc next<br />next:&nbsp; &nbsp;bcc skip<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sbc #12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; carry already set<br />skip:</div>
<br />This takes 8 cycles either way, not that much more than the 5/6 it would when coded normally.
<br />
<br />Now that I'm getting that new PPU synchronization technique to work, I could eliminate almost all the cycle-timing, and put a normal non-cycle-timed music engine in. One of the cool timing-related things inside this is the horizontal scrolling engine. This supports fine horizontal scrolling on a frame-by-frame basis, doing proper timing between frames to avoid drift. Of course with this new PPU synch technique it's trivial to implement, but I hadn't come up with the idea yet with this. :)
<br />
<br />tepples, thanks for posting a video. I was hoping you'd do so, as I know you've got a video digitizer.
