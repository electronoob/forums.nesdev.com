		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been mulling over the idea of a #NESdev related subforum here.
<br />
<br />I think the idea of a #NESdev subforum could be beneficial for a few reasons (among others not listed by myself):
<br />
<br />- Setting up times for multiple people to be in the channel to discuss certain dev-related topics.
<br />
<br />- Advertising the channel as a way for instantaneous help or aid.
<br />
<br />- Listing future and present bot-related commands.
<br />
<br />- Basic communication between the channel and the forum.
<br />
<br />If any of you can think of any other ideas on why it would be beneficial, that would be great to discuss.  (Also, please do not feel barred from criticizing the idea.)
<br />
<br />Comments?

<br />
<br />Just my point of view thought. I don't mind opening a new forum if it does bring a more value for everyone. Just for now I just can't visualize how much volume of mail this forum would have.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I guess it would be cool to have something like that here. That way people could get simple PPU questions and stuff answered almost instantly. I don't see that many cons to the idea besides people having worthless input, typing random garbage simply because they're in a chat session. Seeing responses that simply say "lol" would be annoying...

<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">B00daW wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- Setting up times for multiple people to be in the channel to discuss certain dev-related topics.</div><br /><br />You will have to always create a post for the next discussion. This seems more something that you would put as news on the front page of the nesdev site or on the wiki in the community section.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">B00daW wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- Advertising the channel as a way for instantaneous help or aid.</div><br /><br />Unless you read that specific forum, there will be no advertisement. Same thing as previous comment, should be on the front page of nesdev or wiki is again a better solution.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">B00daW wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- Listing future and present bot-related commands.</div><br /><br />You need sticky just for that. Hmm.. In that case, it could always be fine. It could be added to the wiki too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">B00daW wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- Basic communication between the channel and the forum.</div>
<br />
<br />In that case to discuss about what you said in the channel, I have no problem with it. That make sense and we can open it.
<br />
<br />In brief, if you want to continue to discuss what was in the channel then I have no objection against that. As for the promotion, you should try to promote it on the main page and wiki to reach more audience. Other website could be a possibility too.

A year or so has passed since then and we're back on topic and have many users interested in NESdevving and related conversation.  Competant developers and users, without dropping too many names, engage in intellectual conversation on a daily or nightly basis.  The channel really is a resource to the public.
<br />
<br />Personally as an op, I think the only rule #nesdev has is:  Dev related conversations trump all conversations.  Otherwise almost anything goes.
<br />
<br />I really see no reason not to link the forums and the channel.  However, majority (+ admin) rules.

<br />
<br />- I had problems, probably due to the language barrier, but anyway... the IRC was an obscure place to get some help.

It is shown on the main page as a main section so you cannot miss it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  Could you start to add content?  I guess it should explain what is the channel, where is it located for people like me that doesn't use irc and doesn't know how it work (I should try to connect someday..), the bot commands, events etc.
<br />
<br />For special event, it can always be put on the current news section of the main page.

The best way I think a #NESdev subforum would be useful is if there were to be many posts of IRC logs and stuff like that.  But who knows, I'm open to considering it.  I guess since we're already past one screenful of sub-forums (at my resolution), adding more doesn't hurt too much.
