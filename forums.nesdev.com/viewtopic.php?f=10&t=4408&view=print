I have never programmed in assembler before, and the extent of my NES hacking has gone about as far as making a couple NROM mapper eprom carts with ROMS on them from teh internets. I want to learn how to make something of my own for the NES. Where should I start? My current programming knowledge consists of mostly very old variants of BASIC like Tandy 102 basic and Applesoft. I don't know any C either. Any suggestions?

<br />
<br />And as for C, it's a language where you describe to a compiler the assembly code you want it to create.  It's a generic description of assembly, you won't need to know it.

<br />But you should know at least one language used for making PC programs, even if only to make the tools for converting data to be used by your NES programs.

<br />Celius and Memblers seem to like making their tools for the NES itself. After all, if we use PC tools to make PC programs, why not on the NES? =)
<br />
<br />Seriously, I know that some things just can't be done on the NES. My BMP to level map converter is a pretty good example, as it works with images as big as 20MB. and editing everything tile by tile on the NES would be a pain in the ass.
<br />
<br />So yeah, I agree that knowing how to program for a PC does help a lot.
