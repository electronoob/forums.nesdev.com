How effect of the robot is done? (2:00 on Youtube). I mean: It have only 2 layers of background. One is the text, I think. Can TurboGrafx to manipulate the screen to leave robot (the middle of screen) and do some efects on the sides?(Resizing the columns). Or is it done by using GFX changes?(don't look like it, though).<br />Overall: I liked this. Seems to be something between NES and SNES, my next retro platform to do programming for.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The popularity of a platform is something I take into consideration before developing any serious interest in its architecture. I mean, I do have a general interest for retro hardware, and I often read documents describing the capabilities of even the most obscure gaming consoles, but I would never consider developing for one that didn't still have plenty of working units or a moderately sized fanbase.<br /><br />To me it's mandatory that I own the hardware I'm developing for, I could never trust emulators alone. And when I finally release a game I'll surely want more than 8 people worldwide playing it!

Of course, you'd have to settle for an NTSC unit. But still, it's not a Vectrex we're talking about. Hell, even the Sega 32X - another failed piece of hardware, but one I'd still assume more people in the western world to be familiar with - will fetch prices in that neighborhood these days.<br /><br />Still, I have no plans to get one myself. I already have a TurboGrafx, and I'd rather upgrade to a Turbo Duo (CD-ROM support) than a SuperGrafx. But it's nice to see people developing stuff for these largely forgotten systems.

Lords of Thunder on the Super CD-ROM for PC-Engine does this. I've heard before the reason there was only 1 background layer may have been so you could access VRAM at any time, not just during VBlank. I'm not sure if this is true but I'd think having to obey your standard VBlank/VRAM write rules and having a second background layer would have been more helpful, although maybe that would have risen the price due to the additional VRAM you may have wanted/needed.

Are you saying a regular TG16 has 256 pixels of sprites in 256px mode or more in higher res modes?

Are there any games that do this? All games I've seen appeared to have a single BG layer.
