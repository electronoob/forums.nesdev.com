<br />Well, I could shift the DD project a bit on lower priority..I got a blank new FEoEZ cart just yesterday and she eyes me all the time from the shelf ^^;

Any suggestions from you? </div>What do you expect to do with that documentation? lol If you want to just interface USB to a one time project, use a FTDI module like everyone else.
<br />
<br />BTW, USB 2.0 is way not necessary for SNES and USB modules are like <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/FTDI-UM245R-USB-Parallel-FIFO-module-FT245-AVR-PIC-ARM_W0QQitemZ150254922781QQihZ005QQcategoryZ100184QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem" class="postlink">US$30 after shipping</a>... you could interface a ROM emulator to the EPP parallel port with less logic than the USB module's glue too.
<br />
<br />Do you plan on building a ROM emulator for this project? I've designed an 8/16-bit ROM emulator (13x 74 series chips - $5.50), and I could turn it into a dual ROM emulator and add an EPP interface but it'd be a big chore so I'd only do it if you're serious. PS: you know I'm Calpis on Assembler right? :)

<br />Some indication that the algorithm is adaptive, which considering the SDD1 had changing contexts to maximize compression is not unreasonable.

If every payload was a couple of bytes representing control signals to the SPC interface, it'd be slow as hell to interface since the process relies on FEEDBACK. Not only that but unless the SPC has an acknowledge signal, you'll still have to manually give the FIFO fixed wait states since it's not real time. Honestly, because of this using the parallel port will be much faster than USB if you directly interface with the chip. It's not possible for the 8 MHz parallel port to beat the propagation time of the chip.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">kammedo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The device you listed is maybe too slow?

<br />??? Those are the same thing I linked, but with PICs! How will that help?! You will now have to do I/O through the MCU lol Talk about slow! The FT245's maximum throughput is 1 MiB/s (like half maximum EPP), but with a MCU now it's gotta be less than a quarter of that... You should have bought the plain module and connected it to a CPLD (or better yet, just get the CPLD and connect directly to LPT).

<br />
<br />There is no much to say... There haven't any advance since your discussion in cherryroms' forum back in 2004; i think by that date i did an attempt to look at the data, but i failed to see anything interesting. However, i didn't employed any type of automatic processing that time, so i have always felt i could have done a more serious attempt; that's what is in my to-do list.
<br />
<br />In the while, i have been eagerly awaiting for somebody to construct a hardware interface, but the only serious attempt in this time has been Kammedo/Charles MacDonald's one.
<br />
<br />From what i remember, you did an analysis of the compressed data starting with variable amounts of zeros to conclude which ordering the input and output streams used (i mean, which bits were used first within every byte), and that the algorithm showed an adaptive behaviour, being stabilized the input bits/output bits rate in 1/128 (just like the S-DD1).

<br />I agree that this is the only sane and reasonable approach. Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this a compression chip, not encryption, and hasn't all the data from the games already been decompressed and is known? I thought the main purpose was so that an emulator could have the original 2 MB or whatever compressed data, rather than something like 14 MB of decompressed data (compressed with zlib, which only halves it or so).

<br />Those were notes I compiled for myself while I was working on that.  So, like most of my notes unfortunately, there's enough to be somewhat helpful but not enough to let me pick up were I left off (I'm not sure what some of the comments in those notes even mean now).  If you or anyone else find them useful, by all means feel free to share it.
<br />
<br />I haven't touched any SNES projects in quite awhile now, so forgive my rustiness.  Due to the fact that you have a cartridge, and a SF7, I'd suggest we start nice and simple:  make a SNES program that dumps decompressions from the cartridge to BRAM.  Using the copier menu you can then save the BRAM and check if your program worked fine.
<br />
<br />While we can't do completely arbitrary decompressions this way, it is likely that we can see the output from all possible first two bytes, and much other data to get us going.
<br />
<br />Basically, to get this moving as soon as possible, let's start as simple as possible.

If you or anyone else find them useful, by all means feel free to share it.<br /><br />I haven't touched any SNES projects in quite awhile now, so forgive my rustiness.  Due to the fact that you have a cartridge, and a SF7, I'd suggest we start nice and simple:  make a SNES program that dumps decompressions from the cartridge to BRAM.  Using the copier menu you can then save the BRAM and check if your program worked fine.<br /><br />While we can't do completely arbitrary decompressions this way, it is likely that we can see the output from all possible first two bytes, and much other data to get us going.<br /><br />Basically, to get this moving as soon as possible, let's start as simple as possible.</div>
<br />
<br />I recall having tried to contact you for a while back then - welcome back ^^! Oh, and if Im not wrong, you said you had more notes about that somewere. Would you mind taking a look? I had planned to put the whole CR forums for read-only on the YnT (or the romhacking.net) site , but sadly I havent been able to contact CR's owner. And believe me, I tried.

<br />To be clear, what I was suggesting involved no modifications.  Therefore it would only allow decompressions of byte patterns we can already find on this chip.
<br />
<br />Assuming we are on the same page, the idea is then:
<br />If you get this to work, it would give us some great data to get us started.  This will hopefully give us enough data to figure out the class of compression used, and allow us to formulate precise test cases.  At this point these test cases will probably not be able to be found in the ROM randomly and therefore we will need a way to run arbitrary data through.  At this point we can add a ROM emulator to the board to replace U2.  It can be very small, 8kb would probably be more than enough.
<br />
<br />
<br />So first things first:
<br />Can you play the game on passthrough on the SF7?
<br />(basically checking if the delays are too long, and if the clock signal is making it to the cartridge)
<br />
<br />EDIT: Yes, kyuusaku's idea (which sounds not to need the SNES, and everything controlled from a parallel port) is the most automated and has a faster throughput (insert-&gt;decompress-&gt;readout) rate.  But the method I suggested above gets us data to play with almost immediately, which we can use to formulate some more specific test cases while you can work on extending your system with a rom emulator (of which you would only need one).
<br />
<br />As always, this is merely a suggestion.

We can investigate more about it.<br /><br />Im not sure about it being the same if you use manual decompression (that is you read the data from the 00:48xx interface). I have to check that.

Lets see if I got it right : you would suggest trying to find some specific patterns to look at, starting from the data present in the original U2 chip?

<br />I think that shouldn't be a big issue (playing the game in passthrough).

<br />
<br />That's impossible to say at this point, and i would suggest you to completely forget about it. All the people who could be interested in taking a look at the data (neviksti, byuu, Nach, me, ...)  is perfectly able to make his own tools on the fly as the research progress. So raw compressed/uncompressed data is all we need.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
