Imagine you reading a text string, you need to process one byte at a time, rather than a word. Also, 8 bit operations are faster on 65816.

I've only used 16-bit A where it's worth the hassle of switching and being careful about calling routines which assume A is 8 bits.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ugh, I wrote this long post without paying attention to that psychopathicteen was talking about the <em>SNES</em> instead. Oh well. But I put enough thought into it I don't just want to discard it...<br /><br />Anyway, I'm guess Nintendo took a lot of heat over the NES's &quot;only&quot; having 64 sprites, and so they chose to provide 128 mediocre sprites instead of 64 adjustable ones.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 65%; line-height: normal">The NES shows a lot of signs of being a &quot;skunkworks&quot; project, kinda like the original IBM PC: there's a lot of little weird nits that are odd in hindsight. Some of them are for simplicity or cost (PPU fetch pattern), or show certain assumptions as to how it would be used (noise frequencies). Others show a lack of in-depth understanding the field (DPCM frequency choice), or a lack of time for testing (vis: <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Errata" class="postlink">nesdevwiki:Errata</a> ).<br />For example:<br />The PPU keeps its &quot;nametable - attribute - pattern - pattern&quot; cadence fetching from RAM for the entire scanline, 42 times. The spare bandwidth could have been used for a lot of purposes.<br />The PPU's hardware palette could have been tweaked to significantly increase the number of colors available, especially in the ranges of desaturated or darker colors.<br />The APU's lookup tables used for noise and DPCM are kinda (ok, a lot) off. And the LUTs take up space, so it's not even clear it's a win on complexity.<br />The APU's noise channel tonal flag randomly provides period 31 or period 93, depending on the exact state of the LFSR when the tonal mode is switched.<br />The APU's length counters are only useful in the simplest of music engines.<br />The APU's DPCM sample length counter (16n+1) doesn't provide the most useful values, and its restriction that its data (mostly) only come from the top quarter of the CPU's memory space is inconvenient since that cohabits with the hardware vectors.<br />The APU's DACs use nMOSFET pullups, rather nMOSFET pulldowns, causing the nonlinear mixing of channels.<br />The APU's DACs are internally implemented using <em>2ⁿ</em> MOSFETs for the <em>nth</em> bit, when they could have used gate geometry to the same effect.<br />The CPU's joypad interface seems moderately likely it was originally intended to be used for a parallel input, rather than serial.<br />The CPU's memory map could have been made less goofy by incorporating the functionality of the 74'139 into the CPU die.<br />The CPU's lengthened M2 might be what causes OAMADDR write corruption.<br />The CPU's DMA unit is minimalist and inflexible, and the PPU's primary bus is slow; being able to write to the PPU's primary bus would have been greatly useful.</span>

It is kind of funny MD does more with inferior memory, there's even access slots midframe to do stuff (but not a whole lot).
