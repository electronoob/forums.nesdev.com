As long as you make a new rom with the player code in the same address as the old player code, you can just call the player's init routine and play routine.
<br />
<br />So I'm looking at a generated NES file.  Looks like the player occupies the first 0D20 bytes, then the music data immediately follows it.  When you see a bunch of zeroes or FF's or whatever, you know that data ends.  The rest of the NES file doesn't matter, it's just some stub code to call the player, and the vectors.  If you use DMC samples. there may be a hole in the file before the DMC data.
<br />
<br />Play code is at $8000, init code is at $8003.
<br />Player uses the first 0x10 bytes of zeropage, 0x200-0x2DF, and up to 10 bytes of stack.
<br />As long as you don't step on the player's RAM, and have the memory all mapped correctly there should be no problems.  Just call init once, then call Play once per frame.
<br />
<br />So yes, you can incbin the player code at $8000 if you're making a NES rom.

<br />
<br />If this is the sound fx part, I'm still not implemented yet in my mm9 proof of concept so it may take a while before I start coding it. I'm quite busy these days with my personal life so I don't know when I will be able to work on it. These days, I don't even have time at all to work on my hobby. 
<br />
<br />Version 3.0 of the driver allow to disable the sound channels, it's already implemented (albeit a little bit differently than my approach) if this is the only thing you need to do.
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />
<br />People answered this post while I was writing.  I will add to this post then.

<br />
<br />I would not do that for a game, that is not practical. Instead export the sound data to binary only (i.e. no driver included), include the source code for the sound driver in the segment you want and just change the address were the sound data point to the location where you incbin your custom song data.

<br />
<br />Playing the song inside your game shouldn't be that difficult. Once you include the driver + bin, you just need to set the address of the song, select which song you want to play, init and play.   Maybe I can find some time this weekend and do a quick VRC-6 sample at the same time.

<br />Not bad.  Couple of things I noticed.  It's cool that you can walk behind the tree, but if they coins fall on the other side how is the egg catching them? Also, if you press a button while moving it stops the character from moving.  A little bit of catchy music will add a lot to this project.

<br />
<br />The work is already started but in the new version, there is a lot of flags for enabling/disabling specific chips (VCR6, MMC5 etc) with if condition that doesn't work the same as CA65. So it will take a little bit more time before it can be converted and tested. I'm not sure yet how to convert those flag, thus the reason of delay.  I will see what I can do this week but I cannot promise anything.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I guess what Tepples said mention many of the points you have to be careful. As for being easy, it's all depends on how comfortable you feel about nes programming. The first thing that will be an issue is how to initialize properly the VRC6 mapper. Not hard but a pain when you don't know how it work.
<br />
<br />Like I mentioned, once I figure out how to convert this version properly for nesasm I will try to make the sample VRC6 compatible. It just that I don't have that much time these days.
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />I finished to convert yesterday but the first tests resulted in the rom to fail which means I made a mistake and it will take more time before I can have a stable release.

<br />the nesasm driver is now working.  There is a bug in the driver that cause volumes to go haywire if the ram is not reset properly. In the past (if I remember well) there was some code in the init function that was doing a clean-up and it's not there anymore. I need to fix this.

<br />Nothing new in this driver (from me) except that I fixed a bug that occur when you use multiple binary file. The memory was not reset anymore, causing all kind of issues.
<br />
<br />I started to make a quick sample for VRC6.  The sample is not finish yet: the rom size and mapper setting are probably wrong but will work with emulators (nintendulator and nestopia).  Once I have time, I will try to make a sample that work on the real hardware. For now, it should be enough to insert music in your game.
