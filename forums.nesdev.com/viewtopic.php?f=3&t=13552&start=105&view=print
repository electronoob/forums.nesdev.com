I'd have seriously considered pulling out the credit card at $10-$15. Have you considered a time-limited demo version? Maybe something that automatically exits after 5 minutes or so. Enough to give you a taste of how it works, but doesn't let you really play through any games. That might get more people to bite at $30 if they get a hands-on demonstration of what they're paying for.
