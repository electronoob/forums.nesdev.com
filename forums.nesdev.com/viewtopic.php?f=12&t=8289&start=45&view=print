<br />
<br />I did have the thought of making a 40 pin version for the GQ-4X, but I do not have that programmer, nor would it be compatible with standard Willem's directly.  I suppose both sets of pins could be present, but again.. this was designed with my needs in mind.
<br />
<br />Feel free to mess around with the design, thats why I posted it! heh <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Just to verify I have this correct... in the GQ programmer, you can select the data format. I've chosen ROM and left everything default. Is this a safe way to go?
<br />
<br />I seem to finish writing the data but I get an error on verification...
<br />
<br />The game does run despite the error, but the error doesn't happen till a ways in. So it seems like things are in order. I'll assume the verification error occurs because of the method I'm using to write the data? I dunno. :\

<br />Are you programming these on the carrier boards with the willem adapter, or are you programming them directly before soldering to the carrier?
<br />
<br />What type of chip is this?  I would double and triple check that all of the A lines are soldered well, it could be that one is intermittent.  
<br />
<br />What address does the verify fail at?  Have you tried a double-write?

I am programming it with GQ-4X with their adapter for the A lines interfaced through your adapter board. No ZIF this time. It seems to error at a set of multiple addresses each time I verify about 30% through the check. I have not tried a "double-write". I assume by this you mean writing twice before verifying?

<br />
<br />Otherwise, how are you jumpering the A19-21 lines?  I do not believe that the GQ-4X has the additional address lines as headers by default.  I seem to remember seeing an adapter to give you that header...  EDIT:  this one!  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mcumall.com/comersus/store/comersus_viewItem.asp?idProduct=4288">http://www.mcumall.com/comersus/store/c ... oduct=4288</a><!-- m -->

<br />
<br />Yes, I indeed have the adapter! That's what I was referring to when I said their adapter for the A lines. I'll post a pic. For the record I had to cut notches into the adapter just to get it to fit with your board, and it's still a tight fit.
<br />
<br />While I haven't tried it, I assume removing the adapter would prevent me from writing in the first place! It's on an error on verification. Then again... I haven't actually looked at what's going on here in more detail!

<br />You can download it from MCUMall here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mcumall.com/downloads/download.asp?DownloadID=50">http://www.mcumall.com/downloads/downlo ... nloadID=50</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Otherwise, it seems that your verify fails in the same spot just about every time, perhaps it is just a defective bit on your flash chip...  do you have another one to try?

Just dump the data after programming the chip and verify it with an hex editor. You were lucky enough to be able to erase and program them on this programmer, most people can't even flash the chip cometly without error with that model.
