Nintendo can remove them at any time. They're ruining the fun. And there's nothing we can do <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

Link of Nintendo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">17. A method of adapting an emulator, the method comprising: executing, on a processor, an emulator capable of running a plurality different binary applications; recognizing, by the processor, an identity of a binary application based on an inspection of the binary application; automatically adapting, by the processor, a behavior of the emulator to the binary application based on the recognized identity of the binary application; and generating, by the processor, an audio visual presentation using the adapted behavior of the emulator.</div><br />So the patent covers automatic enabling of speed/accuracy tradeoff options in an emulator based on a ROM's hash. Nintendo has been kicking this one around in the USPTO for a long time. Fortunately, the Game Boy is a fairly simple system, and emulators should be able to run every official game (other than perhaps <em>Prehistorik Man</em>) without hacks. Any emulator that can run homebrew should be immune to the patent.<br /><br />The other part of a patent is the dates, which determine when the patent expires. Patents filed in 1996 or later expire 20 years after the priority date, which in the case of this patent appears to be 2000 or so. I don't see how this patent is going to have a usefully long term.

Well, I agree not to do automatic enabling of speed/accuracy tradeoff options in an emulator based on a ROM's hash anyways, because I believe it is not a good idea anyways (except perhaps Nintendo's own emulators). And certainly any correct implementation needs to be able to run homebrew games as well as the official games (with accuracy), otherwise the implementation is not correct.<br /><br />But, I think I may have read somewhere that there is a few official games where the header won't tell you the mapper properly (there isn't the way to do so it seems); I consider it OK for a software implementation (but not for a hardware implementation) to fail to execute these programs correctly. To make the implementation complete though, there would need to be some way of specifying such files (perhaps support to add one additional &quot;mapper override&quot; file which specifies various parameters that you can set for the game).

The iNES header won't distinguish <em>StarTropics</em> from <em>Low G Man</em>, and the common emulator hack of ignoring the MMC3's WRAM disable and write protect bits to get MMC6 games working breaks <em>LGM</em>. Nor is there a reliable way to distinguish SOROM and SXROM from SNROM and SUROM, or distinguish among the various VRC bit assignments.<br /><br />But fortunately, I today discovered that the official site for iNES (fms.komkon.org) has gone NXDOMAIN. This leaves NES 2.0, which clearly distinguishes MMC3 from MMC6 and the MMC1 boards from one another by their WRAM size, and which has submappers for the VRCs.<br /><strong>Edit:</strong> As of the next morning, it was back up. The DNS server must have gone down.
