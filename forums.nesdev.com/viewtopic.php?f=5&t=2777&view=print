He bothered implementing those weird chinese pirate multi-cards and I got my breath cut about the screenshots for mapper 163 and 164 !
<br />Mapper 163 shows Djins from the GBA game Golden Sun on its screen, but the game orinigally was relased at least in 2001 (since this is the release of the GBA in march 2001) and most certainly even much later, and I doubt there is still pirate cart producted at that time. Mapper 164 is titiled "Final Fantasy", and well, being a hardcore Final Fantasy fan..... I don't know what I'm missing.
<br />Mapper 67 (showing a japanese Dragon Quest title) also intrigate me (originally uses mapper 3). Also, mapper 165 seems to show Fire Emblem 2's intro screen, wich originally uses mapper 10.
<br />I'd really love to have more info about those weird pirate stuff.

<br />
<br />The Djinn one is intriguing, though.

<br />Well, I tried searching list containing that mapper with a ROM example and found none. I'd really be curious what this pirate cart with Golden Sun stuff in it would be.

<br />The "Gimmick!" was probably a pirate (since the "AUTHENTIC ENTERTAINMENT // REALISTIC ANOTHER WORLD // PRESENTED BY SUNSOFT" text above the logo is gone), and I'm pretty sure "Wally Bear" <strong>is</strong> mapper 232.

<br />
<br />Wally bear bankswitches 32k of ROM based on the 3 least significant bits of the value written, so it works as mapper 11, mapper 34, or mapper 77.  I couldn't imagine Wally Bear being hacked to a mapper which does not use 32k bankswitching, especially not the Quattro mapper.

<br />
<br />Yes, that's a pirate gimmick! ROM.  It's a totally different mapper, and doesn't support the FME-7 sound.  Since it's used quite a bit, the game seems to sound like crap compared to the legit version.
<br />
<br />As for wally bear, it's mapper 11 now.  It's been mapper 11 for awhile now actually.  232 was depricated and was reassigned to quattro multicarts (actual gold/silver carts).  231 is quattro games on the aladdin.  Yes, both use a slightly different mapper setup for some dumb reason. blame camerica <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />

<br />Unless, of course, that's a mapper emulation problem... Or is CaH4e3's dump bad? Hold on, let me check...

<br />
<br />BTW, I've tried to emulate one more VCR4 like pirate mapper with the same IRQ problems as mapper 222 (Dragon Ninja), and looks like I solved this problem by some dirty trick, not acrually based on real hardware researching, just tried to make auto IRQ correction... You can try fixed source from CVS, looks like Dragon Ninja shows normal scrolling. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
