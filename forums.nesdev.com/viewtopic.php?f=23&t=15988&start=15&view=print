		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh, I was also going to try a few video codecs at several bitrates and resolutions, to have a baseline for what could be done with FMVs given modern tech. Mpeg1, mpeg2 and the simple xvid profiles, at 640x480 and 320x240, a few bitrates. Mpeg1 is patent-free, last I checked so was mpeg2, mpeg4 would take some years but if the simple profiles are workable, you could just create a custom codec based on the ideas.<br /><br />Things like the older, indexed-color RAD codec would certainly work. I have read the RE2 article, where they achieved 15fps at reduced resolution and 16-bit colors IIRC, but they were under severe space constraints, and only used the GPU for colorspace conversion. Theora would be too heavy, based on quick tests on x86.

(and the L1 cache is only 24 KiB). You'll probably get better results from compiling with GCC's -Os than any other kind of optimizations.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Do you know the memory address to change [parallel interface timing] that or a bit more of info?<br /></div>Public documentation? There's not much useful. There are four registers for each of two different memory regions on the cart. Libdragon barely mentions this at all; only in passing in the linker script.<br /><br />This page: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://n64.icequake.net/mirror/www.crazynation.org/N64/">http://n64.icequake.net/mirror/www.crazynation.org/N64/</a><!-- m --> has a bit of low level information about, particularly:<br /><blockquote style="margin-left: 1%; padding-left: 1%; border-left: 3px solid #555577;">
The first word read is in the cart header address 0 [0x80371240] which sets the bus speed for subsequent cart access.<br />If you set it to 0x8037FF40 then the access timings for loading the boot code at 0x40 in the header would look like the first access at 0, where the read low signal was 4.0us. Can be useful for debugging since all bus activity is slowed down but still functional.
</blockquote> The IPL inside the PIF instructs the CPU to copy those four bytes to the registers at ... uh, ultimately, 0x04600014, 0x04600018, 0x0460001C, and 0x04600020. I guess libdragon's default MMU setup offsets the addresses to  0xA4600014 &amp;c.<br /><br />These registers that configure the speed of the PI <em>should</em> be part of libdragon's PI_regs_s structure (the one that initiates DMA) but, for whatever reason, are omitted. Possibly because it is easy to choose timings that are too aggressive? Supposedly no games ever change the defaults.<br /><br />All I know is that the ones that are actually counts are measured in terms of FSB clocks (i.e. 1/62.5MHz = 16ns), so that 0x12 = (18+1)·16=304 ns that /RD or /WR stays low.
