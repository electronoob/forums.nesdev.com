This looks to be a case of wanting to bend reality, or at least our perception of it, and wanting group agreement. It happens occasionally here. The solution is to accept that one is making decisions, and that they have downsides. Most real decisions do.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Fri Mar 13, 2009 7:05 am</p><hr />

I have heard that the reason for the vastly disparate amount of RF shielding on the Atari 2600 (3/32" of cast aluminum) vs the NES (1/64" of sheet metal) is because the 2600 was the widely-spread computational device and the FCC didn't know how bad the RF would be. As it turns out, 1MHz with traces that are less than 6" isn't a problem, so the FCC relaxed the shielding requirements for future computers.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Thu Mar 12, 2009 7:40 pm</p><hr />

Sounds like the X-Clamps are something to speed manufacturing, unlike the RF shield. Again, its main purpose is to prevent the NES from emitting RF, rather than receiving it (anything received won't match all the RF that's inside the thing already). Your main complaint seems to simply be that it takes a few minutes to re-install, hardly an argument for its uselessness. But you don't have to make the case that it's useless; that it speeds things to leave it out, AND that leaving it out allows the NES to run cooler, are good enough reasons to do so in my opinion (I leave mine out, though I didn't throw it away).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Wed Mar 11, 2009 5:31 am</p><hr />

I would tell them if they even knew what an RF shield was, but the truth of the matter is that 99% wouldn't understand or know either way.  If at all possible, I would still tell them I was removing it and give it to them in case SOMEHOW not having it caused a problem down the road, explaining that (apparently) they tend to be more reliable without it and it isn't really necessary.  That way, if for collectors reasons they want it back in, they can put it, and I don't get a huge buildup of RF shields mucking up the place.  However, most people just want it to work one way or another and don't care what is original and what isn't.  <br /><br />On the flip side, would you get mad if I didn't tell you I was removing the X-Clamps from a RROD XBOX 360, even though its a necessary step in order to replace them with screws?  I can't see anyone really getting mad/annoyed about having the RF shield removed if the system functions perfectly.  It didn't work, they brought it in, it works now, I don't see any wrongdoing there.  Only a collector would ever really care that it was missing, and if they are THAT strict of a collector, they would probably do the work themselves and retain the original connector anyway (clean it/re-bend the pins, etc.).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3414">17daysolderthannes</a> — Mon Mar 09, 2009 11:05 pm</p><hr />
