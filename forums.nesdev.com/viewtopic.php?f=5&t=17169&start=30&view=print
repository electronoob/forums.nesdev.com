Thus, the trio of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Splatoon 2 and Breath of the Wild on the Switch simply doesn’t feel compelling enough for me to drop my Wii U (yet).<br /><br />I played the Arms testfire thingummy a while ago, and whilst it was visually impressive, it didn’t do anything for me, especially at a time when Tekken 7 was available. I am more of a 2D fighter fan than a 3D one though.<br /><br />I’m quite aware that the portability factor is a big deal to most Switch owners however, I have never been one to play games on my daily commute. I only play my 3DS in the comfort of my own home.<br /><br />Still, when the likes of Mario Odyssey, Metroid Prime 4 and whatever Retro Studios are up to are available, I am pretty sure I shall buy one there and then!<br /><br />In regards to the OP, however, the answer is a resounding ‘no’. The Wii U isn’t worth it nowaday; even Nintendo have distanced themselves from it.

I made the mistake of getting one for Splatoon 2 whilst already owning Splatoon for Wii U.

I <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=16414" class="postlink">made one</a> a while back, actually...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">realityengine wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">93143 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">regularly hosted games that looked worse than similar titles on a system</div>I don't think this is quite true if you take a truly holistic approach</div><br />I'm not taking a holistic approach.  I'm just saying that there was a surprising amount of overlap given the power difference, which may be attributable to the N64 being hard to program, compounded by the inefficient official microcode holding the system back.  Comparing bad N64 games with good PlayStation games can make it look like the PlayStation was more powerful, which is not something you tend to get with (say) the NES vs. the SNES.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">missing lighting effects makes emulated N64 games look really bland</div><br />I noticed this with F-Zero X.  I play the real one regularly.  It's higher res in emulation, if you want it, but the shiny is gone.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Well the Playstation didn't have half the RAM of the N64.</div><br />I realized about the VRAM after posting, and figured it wasn't important enough to warrant an edit.  With audio RAM it comes pretty close to even...  and Expansion Pak games were usually not the worst-looking ones, so I can't really claim that as a trump card...<br /><br />Speaking of RAM, what was the latency like on the RCP side?  I've heard figures as high as 600 ns for a CPU cache miss, but I can't imagine that's representative of RCP random access...  Also, I believe the N64's RAM was divided into four banks; did this have any relevance to latency?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">People tend to forget that the N64 uses a lot of its processing power to clean up 3D image quality behind the scenes - it's not a straight-up polygon count contest.</div><br />Absolutely.<br /><br />And yet, it seems that certain late games, such as World Driver Championship, managed to match or exceed the PlayStation's <em>advertised</em> capabilities (180,000 textured tris per second) while maintaining the additional features that made N64 polygons so power-intensive...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I think the only sane way to use hardware additive blending on N64 is just where the RGB values in your scene are very low</div><br />I'm sorry; I can't accept that without more detail.  What's wrong with the methods I proposed?  I could guess, but that's not a path to edification.

From memory, the PPC750 did have an incomplete SMP implementation which was finally completed in the G4 design, so I'm guessing IBM may have done some 'backporting' of G4 SMP technology into the PPC750.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">93143 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If this N64 discussion goes much further, maybe we should take it to a different thread in Other Retro Dev.
