True, <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> came bundled with most NES consoles, either by itself or in a multicart that also included <em>Duck Hunt</em> or <em>Tetris</em>. But the Challenge Set had <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>, all toploaders (Famicom and NES-101) lacked a pack-in, and not all used consoles include some form of <em>SMB</em>. In addition, we have SNESdev, where not everybody has <em>All-Stars</em>, and GBDev, where not everybody has <em>SMB Deluxe</em> or even specifically a Game Boy Color for that matter.<br /><br />&quot;Bullying&quot; someone to explore another resource available from the same domain (namely our wiki) is more tolerable than &quot;bullying&quot; someone to buy a particular publisher's nonfree game (namely <em>SMB</em>).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mic_ wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It doesn't help that the answers seem to be case sensitive, or that it isn't apparent how one should formulate the answer even if one knows the answer (is our princess &quot;in another castle&quot;, or in &quot;another castle&quot;?).</div><br />Or even &quot;World 8&quot; or &quot;World 8-4&quot;, formulations that might be resistant to <a href="https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Popcultural_Osmosis" class="postlink">osmosis</a>.

In addition to be more tolerable than &quot;bullying&quot; someone to buy a particular publisher's nonfree game, it is also more tolerable then &quot;bullying&quot; someone to look at an external resource (even if that external resource is free); to look only at resources available on the same website for free is better.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">dougeff wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">zzo38 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I disagree with HTTPS-only</div>Google insists.</div>I thought <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2462680/google-lowers-search-ranking-of-websites-that-dont-use-encryption.html" class="postlink">Google Search's cleartext penalty</a> insisted on the site being <em>available</em> through HTTPS with <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">&lt;link rel=&quot;canonical&quot;&gt;</tt> pointing to an HTTPS page, not that the server force a redirect from HTTP to HTTPS.

(HSTS is an HTTP header telling the browser to rewrite the scheme for all HTTP requests to the same hostname to HTTPS for at least the next month.)</div>HSTS is terrible and does not improve security or anything else. HTTPS-only also doesn't help. If you do need redirects to HTTPS for Google, well, you can know that Google itself redirects to HTTPS only for certain user-agents, so you can do the same (possibly using the same list). There are things that can be done to improve security:<ul><li>Implement HPKP (&quot;no-user-recourse&quot; is bad though, but that is a client-side concern and is not a server-side concern).</li><li>Set cookies as non-scriptable.</li><li>When users login over HTTPS, set the cookies as secure-only.</li><li>Allow encrypted private messages (encrypted on the client side if the user agrees to execute the encryption program) to be sent to users who have enabled encrypted private messages in their profile.</li><li>Allow users connecting through HTTPS to use their own encryption keys if they wish to do so. (This one is probably the most difficult one to implement.)</li></ul>

I kind of had a hunch that something went wrong with the migration so I posted my comment to know why it was happening suddenly.<br /><br />As for bullying, I was just joking about the fact that the question was asked every time and now it was over, thus the smilley to convey that I was not serious about my previous comment.
