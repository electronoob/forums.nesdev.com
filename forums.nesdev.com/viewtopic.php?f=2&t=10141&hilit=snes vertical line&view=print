		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've got a question about the resolution of the NES vs. the resolution of the Super Nintendo:<br /><br />The NES is 256 x 240 while a standard NTSC TV typically just shows 256 x 224 of the pixels. But from a pure data point of view, it's 256 x 240 and you can make the additional rows visible in an emulator.<br />The Super Nintendo is 256 x 224 and even in an emulator, you see just that, not 256 x 240.<br /><br />So, does that mean that the Super Nintendo has a lower resolution than the NES?<br /><br />And if a TV cuts off some of the rows from the NES image, wouldn't that mean that the TV cuts off rows from the Super Nintendo image as well? And since the Super Nintendo has only 224 pixel rows natively, wouldn't that mean that the Super Nintendo image as shown by an NTSC TV screen is even less than 224 rows while the same TV screen does show 224 <span class="posthilit">line</span> of the NES's 240 lines?

This information is considered one of those &quot;tribal knowledge&quot; things when working with either NTSC or PAL.<br /><br />Furthermore, the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span>/SFC offers a high-resolution interlaced mode (controlled via bit 0 of <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">INISET</tt>).  The way this works depends on what video mode you're using; video modes 0-4 and 7 behave differently than modes 5 and 6 when using interlaced mode.  There's too much to discuss about this mode in a post, so I'm not going to (if you want to read more about it, drop me a PM and I can give you a link to a PDF that you can enjoy sifting through).  There are games which use this, usually as a &quot;high resolution&quot; title screen with little to no animation (example title: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopPlp3baT0" class="postlink">Yuu Yuu Hakusho Tokubetsu Hen's</a> first couple screens when powering on the system).<br /><br />Finally, there is what's called &quot;H-Pseudo 512&quot; mode (controlled via bit 3 of <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">INISET</tt>), where in modes 0-4 and 7 you get visually 512 horizontal pixels of resolution, with the console itself doing a form of blending/averaging between two pixels (i.e. if normally two pixels of red (rgb 255,0,0) and black (rgb 0,0,0)) were next to one another, this mode would result visually in 3 pixels: rgb 255,0,0 / rgb 128,0,0 / rgb 0,0,0.  You cannot use add/sub screen capabilities when using H-Pseudo 512.  I've never seen this used, but there are probably some games that I've never played which do.<br /><br />So no, the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span>/SFC does have generally higher resolution modes than the NES, but they are not commonly/consistently used throughout lots of games.  They're less common given their limitations and higher complexities.  Most people use 256x240 or 256x224.  NTSC vs. PAL plays a role here, obviously.<br /><br />Bottom <span class="posthilit">line</span>: games on the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span>/SFC tended to use all the available pixels, and DO NOT avoid use of certain areas (columns or lines) just because &quot;someone's TV might cut it off&quot;.  If someone's TV cut off some of the visual area, the owner/user was expected to adjust the H-size or V-size of their TV.  Meaning: there was less concern over the &quot;title safe&quot; and &quot;action safe&quot; areas (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overscan" class="postlink">see wikipedia</a> for what those terms mean), and people were simply expected to adjust their TV sets.<br /><br />For example on my Sony Trinitron CRT/TV, with many NES and <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> games I have difficulty seeing the top and bottom 4-5 scanlines given how the actual TV operates/behaves.  The solution is for me to adjust (decrease) V-size slightly.<br /><br />The thing the NES did with <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">PPUMASK &#40;$2011&#41;</tt> bits 1 an 2 (show/hide the left 8 most pixels of the screen for BG and sprites, respectively) was just silly.  There is nothing like that on the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span>/SFC.<br /><br />P.S. -- 256x240 mode does not &quot;show extra black&quot; at the bottom of the screen compared to 256x224.  Instead, what ends up happening is that in 256x224 VBlank lasts a bit longer (meaning with NTSC you have less VBlank time).  The <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Clock_rate" class="postlink">same applies on the NES</a>.<br /><br />P.P.S. -- I'll drop byuu a PM on here and let him know of this thread (since it's in the NESdev section not SNESdev, not sure if he visits the non-<span class="posthilit">SNES</span> sections), as he can probably add some clarification to some of what I've said.

The imbalance between top and bottom appears to come from how analog TVs' <span class="posthilit">vertical</span> retrace circuits handle the slightly faster frame rate of the NES and Super NES.
