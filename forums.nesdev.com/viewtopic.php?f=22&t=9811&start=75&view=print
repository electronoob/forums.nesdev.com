In my experience, however, the copyright owner will usually just flag it as theirs and place ads on it to collect revenue (which is kind of a crappy default, since it screws the cover artist out of their rightful share of the revenue, which under other circumstances is usually about a 9:1 share for the cover artist, but this is the current state of things). The other things might sometimes happen are that they will request that it be taken down, or they will do nothing at all.<br /><br />However, since these are publicly published songs, you can license them automatically by paying the mechanical royalty rates. In the US if I remember correctly this is roughly 9c per song, per download. There are services like <a href="https://www.songclearance.com/" class="postlink">limelight</a> that can assist with this (for a fee). Of course, this royalty is required whether or not you're selling the download.

You need a sync license for that, and sync licenses are purely negotiated.

Well, never mind then.<br /><br />Though, last time I looked it over, there is some amount of arbitrariness about the distinction between what qualifies for mechanical vs sync licensing. I don't think it specifically states the media type (CD or Tape, etc.) but I think there is language about whether it's &quot;interactive&quot;... trying to dig up what I read before but not having much luck.<br /><br />At any rate it's probably not something you want to start distributing for free with your app.

It was a bad idea. <br /><br />Yeah, that was controversial. With Ouya being free-to-play we couldn't charge for the emulator itself so we had a couple options in mind to help make ends meet. We wanted to try this pay for cheating out first to see how it would work. We give lots of free minutes as well (lots of free minutes to start, daily play bonuses etc), so really it only affects super heavy users. The idea is the revenue would go to the developers of the games and also pay for the storage for the upcoming time-attack competitions (storage gets expensive and we can't do that for free). While we still have hopes that once competitions comes online that things might come around, especially once we balance the minutes per price, we are preparing changing it to a use X minutes of cheat time, then pay to unlock forever. However if we do that, then we must charge for entries to competitions.

Which means we have to make some optional emulator features that we can sell on top of that (which is not a bad incentive). I wouldn't feel right backing out on that commitment though without everyone's consent. <br /><br />So, what we are working on now is a pay-to-unlock certain features instead. Where If you want rewind/slomo, you can pay to unlock it. Same with game genie for a dollar, etc. For competitions, there would be a single entry fee per competition, that you can submit as many times as you like once you have entered once for free.

Lets see if there is a way that I can help support you guys the very best while not receiving any of your hard earned revenue.

Even still it seems like a challenging task to earn money off an emulator.  Just based on the other devices out there capable of performing emulation it won't be long before someone is willing to offer an emu for free.  Even if your emu is leaps and bounds better, to the average user they are pretty much indistinguishable.  They either play your rom or they don't,  that's all I knew 5 years ago.  <br /><br />Not that I have any game I'd like to release, so I'm speaking with little weight here.  But it the fact your emulator is free and popular among users is a bigger advantage than letting me keep all the money from rom sales.  I'd be concerned the unpopularity of the emu to it's users based on some sort of pay to play charges for the emu would stunt overall sales of my rom.  In other words I'd rather share some small portion of $1000 of sales with you than have $300 of sales all to myself.  Obviously I don't have any market data behind those numbers but that would be my concern/prediction as a developer.  I know you 'promised' to not take any of the developers income, but I'd fear you'll soon be taken out in the OUYA emulation competition by someone who will...  It's noble of you to not want to dip into the earnings of a developer, but it doesn't sound like a recipe for success.<br /><br />Anyone with half a brain is going to get by with paying as little to no money as possible if they just want to play mario.  The appeal of your emu is that they could then be introduced to a developers game via advertisement within you emu and be convinced to pay to download the new homebrew game.  So if the emu is completely free the user isn't paying money to get advertised to about the developers game.  But if you have some sort of pay to play structure on the emu alone, the developer is only able to advertise to people who are willing to pay money to be advertised to.  Not a lot of people are interested in spending money to be advertised to...

However, we are asking people to pay to unlock some forms of cheating. Save states are free, for example, but rewind/slomo is not. <br /><br />The most popular NES emulators on Android are ad supported with pay to get rid of ads. We are also considering that, but I really really don't like advertisements - so thats probably the very last option on the table. I think we would even do donation based over that if we could.

More of an indirect advertisement of exposing the roms that you/developers are selling.<br /><br />Paying to unlock advanced features like save states and cheats/game genie type stuff sounds like a good approach too.  Really all I was trying to say is that if/when I make a legit homebrew game I for one wouldn't be against sharing a portion of the sales with you.  You're going through a lot of time effort to allow a developers games to be sold on this media and I don't think it's unreasonable for you to get compensation because of that.
