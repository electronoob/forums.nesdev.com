		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />All the Famicom Disk System images I see are in .fds format. But the way I will be backing up and restoring Famicom Disk System games with my MGD1 with FDS drive and MGD2PC cable. 
<br />
<br />My question is, will this method require that the .fds files be converted or edited in some way? I have a 3206 FDS drive, so will I be able to write to disks? Or do I need some sort of modification and/or 7201 drive? My 3206 currently (with copy master and my Venus Game Saver) can copy from original disk to pirated disk, pirated disk to pirated disk, but not from original to original nor pirated to original.

<br />I didn't' see any info on converting or editing .fds to work with the MGD1 setup. My 3206 drive was modded to write disks (found that out from Ki, Tom's friend).

<br />I got it from gamedoctorhk.com and the claimed it had the write function mod. I am able to use copy master to write from disk to disk. I cracked it open and yes, looks like the power mod was done.

<br />
<br />Well sure, it has to have to power mod, but is there an additional write-mod board installed that connects to the disk module?

<br />There should be a couple of wires coming off of the disk module itself leading to an obviously homemade circuit.  You can't miss it, I would guess.

<br />
<br />I am still trying to figure out how to write .fds images with an MGD1. I looked at an MGD format FDS image and .fds image and though saw some differences, I have no idea how to make the .fds images work with my MGD1. I will however start dumping my original FDS games to MGD1 format.

<br />
<br />
<br />I don't know about using images not reading from your own disks, but seems most FDS disks are backed up anyways, so really no need to back up your own disks. 
<br />
<br />To write .fds images to your FDS disks, you need an FDS to PC cable (atatches to your PC's parallel port on one end, and to your FDS drive on the other). 
<br />
<br />There is a separate cable for sending .fds images to the FDS RAM adapter, which eliminates the need for disks.

<br />
<br />FDSLoadr will make FDS images that will run in emulators/PowerPak but it's not a reliable writing method, I haven't heard of anyone getting it to work besides the author. This format is not suitable for archival because it's missing low level data essential for error detection and comparing raw dumps. Modifying it for true dumps/proper writing is just a matter of updating the PC software.
<br />
<br />MGD will make FDS images that will not run in emulators because they're a modified raw disk dump, but they can be reliably written back to disk. The MGD's dumps are ALSO not suitable for archival because while they are in the low level format, they've been "touched up" by the MGD locally; error detection is stripped/recalculated during transfer, redundant sync data is removed, the header is "fixed" according to what the MGD detects and everything it decides is not a file is stripped.
