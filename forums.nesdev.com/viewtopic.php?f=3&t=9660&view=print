I'm assuming you mean Arkanoid (U).nes.  When I run that it is CNROM and has 2 CHR banks.  Make sure that no matter what is written to $8000 - $FFFF you only use the number of bits necessary to select between the actual number of banks present in the image.<br /><br />I looked at my CNROM implementation and I don't mask any bits so that implies that the correct values are written to $8000 - $FFFF at least by Arkanoid (U).nes [which works for me].

You are probably a victim of the common buffer overflow (bufferus overflowis). <br />C++ provides many abstractions to prevent buffer overflows, for instance std::vector&lt;&gt; or std::array&lt;&gt;. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

In that case you should be able to see what value VideoRAM has when execution halts. Does it look valid (you seem to be writing only 0 and 1 to it, so then it should never contain anything else)? If it doesn't you might be having problems with buffer overflows as Jsolo suggested.<br />Another potential error source would be concurrency, though I have no idea how you've structured your emulator, and it's impossible to say from the snippets of code pasted here. If you've got dependencies to a global variable in more than one thread and at least one of those threads is modifying the variable you'll typically want to make those pieces of code mutually exclusive from one another.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Nowhere in the program is VideoRAM being set to 1 by mistake</div><br />At which points do you set it to 1 on purpose though? Might that have happened sometime earlier during execution, and now you're looking at an old value of VideoRAM while VRAM has been freed?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">are you sure it's not just uninitialized ... memory?</div><br />Only local variables (i.e. those allocated on the stack) are truly uninitialized in C++. A global or local static variable should contain a zero value if not explictly initialized.
