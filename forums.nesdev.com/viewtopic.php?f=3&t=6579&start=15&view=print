<br />Go at it the other way: remove those values from the log so that it's in the same format as your emu. Automate removal (with a regexp/grep) and you can trust that the log wasn't otherwise altered.

<br />Agreed. Def safer that way.

<br />
<br />One comment.  I've finally got some minimal processor status output being printed.  The first thing I noticed was that my processor status value did not match the nestest log.  On the very first line the value in my P register was $04 and the nestest log shows it as being $24.  The errant bit is the unimplemented flag that is always '1'.
<br />
<br />So, technically speaking, isn't the nestest log incorrect? Bit 5 (and bit 4) of the P register only really "exist" when they are pushed to the stack (see <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/CPU_status_flag_behavior">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/CPU_ ... g_behavior</a><!-- m -->). Is this a bug in the emulator that generated this log (or rather just a result of the standard confusion surrounding bits 4 and 5 of the P register)?  In my opinion bit 5 of P should be '0' in the nestest log - it just seems more accurate to me.
<br />
<br />Thanks!

<br />
<br />Don't get me wrong - I'm not complaining about the log - it's actually really good.  There's just a minor discrepancy in the P bits that could lead to some confusion - haha, like it did for me. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Which is why I suggested making a small link to this post from the Wiki.  May not even be worth - it's really not a big issue.

<br />
<br />Well, thanks to you I got everything working properly and a ton of problems went away.  The only issue I had was trying to easily compare the two documents (my output and the 'gold' nestest.log).  Making minor edits to have similar formatting was easy, but it would have taken quite a bit more work to add all of the opcode names and their respective addresses and return-data (ex. 'ADC ($80,X) @ 80 = 0200 = 69').  I also didn't have timing setup just yet and I'm still not sure what 'SL' is.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> This made the Compare in Notepad++ take almost 5 minutes for each change that I made (being nearly 9000 lines and all).
<br />
<br />To fix this (for me), I just used Notepad++ to remove those blocks altogether from the master log file.
<br />
<br />I ended up with something more simple like this:
<br />C5F5  A2     A:00   X:00   Y:00   P:24   SP:FD
<br />
<br />I think it's safe to assume that anyone who is far enough along to run this test has setup these register and values.  After doing this and comparing with the master document, the searches only took seconds and I was able to hammer out all the remaining issues in a matter of hours instead of days.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I'm not sure why I'm saying all this, but I am really grateful.  So, thanks again!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
