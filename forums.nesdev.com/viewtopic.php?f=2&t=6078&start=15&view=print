		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I tried to figure out the checksum stuff ($FFF0/$FFF1 and $FFF2/$FFF3), seems it's very inconsistent like everything else with this header.
<br />
<br />In some games, at least "Double Dribble (U) (PRG0) [!].nes", "Dr. Mario (U) (PRG0) [!].nes", "Dragon Fighter (U) [!].nes" checksum seems to be sum of all bytes in the last 16K PRG bank of the ROM (checksum bytes themself should be set to 0 when calculating). In PRG1 revisions of those games the checksum either is incorrect or is calculated differently.
<br />
<br />In at least "Times of Lore (U) [!p].nes" and "Isolated Warrior (U) [!].nes" checksum is sum of ALL bytes in the PRG ROM.
<br />
<br />In "Duck Tales 2 (U) [!].nes" checksum is sum of all bytes, but the checksum bytes are in big endian order. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />
<br />
<br />The bytes at $FFF2/$FFF3 are the CHR ROM checksum. It's also simply the sum of all bytes in the CHR ROM. 
<br />
<br />So all in all, very inconsistent stuff, and hardly useful for anything. But fun nevertheless.

<br />I was going to try and do a program that tries to compute the checksum but it seems you beat it to me. I'm not surprised that (PRG1) ROMs have incorrect checksums - likely they kept headers from PRG0 version, at least like they did on SMB3.
<br />
<br />I also wonder about how they are calculated in Dragon Warrior games that have an header in each bank. It would make sense it it the sum of the bytes in the bank where the header is placed, but some banks shares an identical header.

<br />Heh, funnily just noticed right now, in Dr. Mario PRG 0 the checksum is sum of the bytes in the last 16K bank, but in PRG 1 it's the sum of all bytes in the PRG ROM <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Very strange they have been changing that around.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I updated the text files that I posted in the earlier message. They now contain also the calculated checksums for comparison.

<br />Hey no problem, I was going to do that anyways at some point. Just need to think of a good way to detect when there's no header.

<br />Divide the bytes in the title portion into three categories: ASCII printable ($20-$7E), nulls ($00 and $FF), and everything else. If there are at least twice as many "ASCII printable" as "everything else", assume a header.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No...
<br />I've found many games, mostly from Rare and Koei, that have text instead of the header, but it's obviously not a header as the text starts before $ffe0 and ends where there would be the other info instead.
<br />
<br />Also most later Capcom tiltles have no "name", but have other info here in the header.
<br />
<br />I'm not too sure about it tough - it'd seem hard to tell apart a game with incorrect header from one which have no header at all.
<br />
<br />Once thing which is sure is that when all the entiere header is filled with a constant value, it is no header. This should eliminate quite some headerless games.
<br />
<br />After that, I think the most reliable way would be to ignore games which have "inconsistant" mirroring byte OR "inconsistant" PRG/CHR sizes (by inconsistant I mean the nybble greater than 5, not incorrect by not being correct, because many headers have it "incorrect") AND which have no ASCII letters in the title.
<br />
<br />That way later Capcom games would pass the check as they have "correct" mirroring, PRG &amp; CHR sizes, and Rare/Koei games wouldn't pass because they have both incorrect mirroring and PRG/CHR bytes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I did modify my app to try to ignore invalid headers. It tries to check the name field (it'll give false positive on some Rare games at least). It also checks PRG and CHR checksum. If it detects any of these fields as valid it assumes the header is valid. So it's not foolproof.
<br />
<br />Out of the 240 ROMs in "Europe" directory 91 (38%) detected as valid:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://thefox.aspekt.fi/hdrinfos-europe-valid.txt">http://thefox.aspekt.fi/hdrinfos-europe-valid.txt</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Out of the 732 ROMs in "USA" directory 242 (33%) detected as valid
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://thefox.aspekt.fi/hdrinfos-usa-valid.txt">http://thefox.aspekt.fi/hdrinfos-usa-valid.txt</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Out of the 1071  ROMs in "Japan" directory 463 (43%) detected as valid
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://thefox.aspekt.fi/hdrinfos-japan-valid.txt">http://thefox.aspekt.fi/hdrinfos-japan-valid.txt</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Of course being detected valid doesn't mean that the header is complete and as said there are some false positives in there too. But surprisingly many Japanese titles contain a header of some sort.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Found a bug, some ROMs like Spot (J).nes are detected as valid because CHR checksum is 0 in the header and the game uses CHR-RAM. Will fix this later.

I believe he said the checksum is supposed to be of the last bank, not the whole ROM.  That makes sense now that I think about it, as it would make for a nice automated sanity/bad connection check.  Considering the Famicombox has what, 16 cart slots?  One would get a headrush from blowing all those out, heheh.
