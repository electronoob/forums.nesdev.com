That would be super powerful.</div>I noticed there are no open issues on the github project page so I wanted to re-request this feature in case it got lost in the thread.<br /><br />Our of curiosity, is this something that's hard to do?<br /><br />As of right now if I want to trigger on a vblank/hblank I have to actually insert special code into my application to loop on reads of $4212 and set a breakpoint on it. This is pretty annoying since inserting this special debug code then changes all of the addresses for other breakpoints in the ROM. The only other option is to sit there and hold the &quot;Step&quot; button continuously until you get to the next hblank/vblank. Not so bad if you just want the very next hblank, but if you want like 30 hblanks in the future or even worse...the next vblank!...then you've got major problems.

You don't need anything graphically fancy, I'd be happy with just a set of 12 check boxes for pressed/not-pressed state.<br /><br />So my updated feature request list is:<br />1) Add buttons in the Debugger window for &quot;Run to next Vblank&quot; and &quot;Run to next Hblank&quot;.<br />2) Add ability to set controller button states during debugging.<br /><br />Thanks again for making such a great debugger.

I hijacked one of the unused store dialogs to intercept the gamepad read and OR the B button bit so it immediately exits the store without ever displaying anything. Since the store dialogs are full-screen, voila, I now have a command to reload all of the graphics for an area after playing a video, without having to do it all manually. It even fades in for me and everything. Definitely agree the override dialog would be a useful feature (also, agreed that without it, a USB/Bluetooth gamepad makes this much easier since you can hold the buttons without any side effects outside of the emulator like you get with keyboard input).
