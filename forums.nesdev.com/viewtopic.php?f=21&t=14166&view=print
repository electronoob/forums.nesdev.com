I haven't analyzed colors yet, but I want to keep it within 4 palettes and 512 tiles, just to leave room for the other 2 layers.  Anybody have some constructive criticism?  There are parts that I like, such as the bridge, the Jetsons-like building, the billboard, the clock tower, but some I feel need improvement like brown building, the grey building and the orange building.  I also feel like there's too much empty space, even though that probably won't be a problem with the far background behind it.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

If a window is reasonably up to 10 feet wide, then that building to the left of the 'show girls' sign looks like its about 30 feet by 30 feet, tops. Actual buildings are usually over 100 feet, maybe even 300+ feet long.

Whether this is good or bad is up to you. <br /><br />Maybe, the one next to the billboard ought perhaps to be edited, realigned, or placed on the layer behind, or something. Personally, i like the warped perspectives, but this one stands out as a little more warped than the others, maybe because it is in so close proximity to the billboard.<br /><br />EDIT: OR, you could place the billboard slightly in front of the building and see what effect that would have.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Regarding colour schemes, i think you could work with warmth/cold to convey the sense of depth you might be looking for. You could try to use cold, green, blue, teal and gray for objects you wish to be percieved as more distant than the others, and orange, peach, gold, tan, old computer beige, brown etc for objects closer to the player's point of view (the house in front of the bridge, for example). <br /><br />That'd also work well with your new windows, ie, closer buildings will have sharply defined windows due to the warm/cold contrast, and more distant buildings will feel less distinct since the blue for the window panes is already cold.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The perspective is poor if you're going for realism, buildings normally align with each other (think of the streets between them), etc...<br /><br />However I think it all fits with the style of your character art. I said before that your main character kinda reminds me of a plastic toy doll. This stuff fits with that, the jumble of buildings with irregular alignment again feels like plastic toys. Maybe part of it is the white sky suggesting this story takes place on a model table in a photographic studio.<br /><br />The blue building on the left has weird lighting. The flat face of a building should have a mostly flat shade, not a gradient like that. The tan building in the middle does this better, there are textural accents and shaded corners, but each face is a flat shade. The angle of its top-left edge is very steep, which makes its perspective strange as well.<br /><br />The green arches have a similar problem. The dark area next to the clock-tower could be justified as a shadow but the dark area on the far side might not make sense unless connected to something else, though it doesn't stand out as a problem as much to me. The middle pillar on the arch, though, seems to cut off abruptly, maybe could use a tiny bit of shading to indicate it terminates at the tan bridge.<br /><br />The orange building stands out too much (very bright), and the extra shading in the corner really makes the shape look warped. It looks like it's being squished, and I think what you were looking for is just a shiny flat glass face. Maybe try not to shade every cell like a bubble; keep the grid frame but give the glass panels a flat shading and draw a highlight across it as if they were one big flat piece of glass. Don't try to treat each one individually like this.<br /><br />Casting shadows between adjacent buildings might contribute more sense of depth.
