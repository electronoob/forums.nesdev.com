		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I found Blargg's cpu test roms on the &quot;Emulator Tests&quot; page of the wiki - the test are at: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://blargg.8bitalley.com/parodius/nes-tests/instr_test-v3.zip">http://blargg.8bitalley.com/parodius/ne ... est-v3.zip</a><!-- m --><br />I thought these would be perfect for testing my cpu core.  I ran into a strange problem, was wondering if anyone could explain it to me.  I started with the &quot;official_only.nes&quot; file, but quit on that because it uses mapper #1 (SxROM), buy my emulator is very new and only handles NROM.  So I moved on to the individual tests, and started with &quot;01-implied.nes&quot; which is in fact NROM.  This was great, I found several bugs, but eventually I got segfaults in my emulator when the ROM accessed memory address $6000.  This is the Save RAM area.  Based on the iNES specification in the wiki, bit 4 of flags_10 in the iNES header determines if there is any RAM located at address $6000.  This ROM has the value of 0 in flags_10 - so no RAM.  I therefore didn't allocate any, and when the rom went to read it I got a segfault.<br />My question is: Should this ROM have bit 4 in flags_10 set?  Am I misinterpreting?  I looked at older iNES specifications (before flags_10 existed) and it sort of implied that bit 1 of flags_6 was used to indicate the existence of SRAM - the ROM in question has this set to 0 as well though.<br /><br />I already know that:<br /> - my emulator should support SxROM<br /> - my emulator should not crash if a ROM claims to not have SRAM, yet writes to it anyway

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Mapper 0 includes NROM and Family BASIC. The only functional difference between these is that in NROM, $6000-$7FFF is open bus, but it's RAM in Family BASIC, decoded by a 4-input NAND gate (half of a 74LS20 or 74HC20). Emulators following the original iNES spec generalize <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PRG_RAM_circuit" class="postlink">the circuit found in Family BASIC</a> to other popular discrete mappers.<br /><br />The battery bit in flags 6 just indicates whether or not the game contains some persistent memory. It'd be true for Family BASIC, but it'd be false for a cart with no RAM or (apparently in this case) a cart with RAM that isn't battery-backed.<br /><br />Flags 8, 9, and 10 might not be accurate in old iNES ROM images. <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0" class="postlink">NES 2.0</a> headers are more likely to be correct about RAM size.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Any NES program can try to read and write $6000-$7FFF. If your emulator crashes, it's got a bug. My test ROMs write to $6000-$7FFF a copy of everything printed, as well as test result, to help with emulators that don't even support the PPU. It's fine if that region is open-bus. And yes, the official_only.nes compilation does require a mapper that supports bank selection, as it runs each sub-test ROM separately.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The bit in the header simply indicates whether or not RAM should be battery-backed.  Some games (e.g., Metroid) have RAM that is not battery-backed, but there is no flag for this in the header.<br /><br />You can get away with just always emulating RAM in that region. I'm unaware of any games that will break if it's there when it shouldn't be.
