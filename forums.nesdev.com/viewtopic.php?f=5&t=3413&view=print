<br />Here's two pics:

<br />
<br />Does anyone have a clue why SNES carts have two different shapes?

<br />
<br />The Game Genie idea is an interesting thought. I never understood why Nintendo had such a beef with the thing, how would it have affected them business-wise at all?

<br />
<br />Or maybe a concern that people would just borrow/rent the game and finish it quickly.  After all, most codes in the book just make the games easier.
<br />
<br />I still find the fact that Codemasters came up with so many codes really impressive.

<br />
<br />I'm sure they were going to make more codes until Nintendo stepped in like when Nintendo Sued Galoob for making the Nintendo game genie.
