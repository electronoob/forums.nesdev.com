		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Are there any emulators with debuggers / hex editors which allow you to increment / decrement bytes using the mouse wheel or key / mousewheel combination? if this isn't a regular feature it should be. I'm sure many people here have spent hours typing in hexadecimal bytes with their left hand until their whole arm was sore. I've even tried dipping into the FCEUXD SP sourcecode to see if it was remotely possible to make that alteration to the program alas my C++ is worse than my Hebrew. has anyone here found another possible solution to this problem?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />ResEdit was before mice made by Apple even routinely had a second button, let alone a scroll wheel. That didn't become common until the <s>Mighty</s> Mouse. Does its successor (Interface Builder in Xcode) bind any editing functions to the wheel?<br /><br />How would a hex editor distinguish scroll wheel events to change a nibble from scroll wheel events to actually scroll the window? Would it be acceptable to hold a key on the keyboard to enter wheel=increment mode? If you cannot find an existing hex editor as precedent to answer the question of user expectation, do tracker-style music sequencers have a similar binding for the scroll wheel?

Guess the comfort zone would depend on mouse dpi as well.<br /><br />edit: for 0-ff that is. if only changing 0-f, there'd be more space to turn around on.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />FCEUX and Mesen both have built in assemblers, so you could type in assembly code instead of hex, if that's any easier.<br /><br />Though TBH I'd be curious what you are trying to do that requires typing in a lot of hex digits into an emulator? If you're copying large amounts of data, maybe you could do it with an automated script instead? (Or with existing cut and paste functionality?)
