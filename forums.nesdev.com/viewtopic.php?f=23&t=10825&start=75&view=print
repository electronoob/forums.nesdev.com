Uploading the sketch obviously worked (according to IDE and some lights flashing).<br /><br />I don't know how to correctly initialize the port. And I don't have experience with Arduino programming.<br />As said I have copied the code from other projects.<br />I changed  &quot;while Serial.available() &lt;=0&quot; in &gt;0. Same problem.<br /><br />I also don't know if the setting of parity and stop bits,  flow control etc are correct. I haven't found anything about that. It's somehow serial to USB convert.

So that's the end.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /> <br /><br />Someone said, I would need a connection to OE.<br />I was pretty sure that this only can be pin 46 (S3). I put that to GND (using a resistor). After that the FTDI board wasn't recognized anymore. No COM port. <br />Device Manager code 43 (Unknown device). I read that could mean that the front USB hub was busted But I also checked the rear one and on a different PC).<br /><br />I tried to remove and reinstall the drivers automatically and manually and tried every FTDI tool including deleting the vendor ID. It could also have been destroyed for some other reason.<br />If I had a working code at the beginning, it might have been worked.<br /><br />Thanks to everybody who tried to help.<br /><br />Maybe I will find someone who has more skills and some hardware or maybe there will be someone else who read this and trying it himself.<br />Even if I had a dump, someone said that writing an emulator would be extremely difficult.<br /><br />I currently trying to write a simulator of my favourite game.<br />First I tried it for Gameboy. But I had problems with the map tool. Always displayed wrong. Music and sound effects would also be a problem on the GB. Many tools disappeared. I tried some software on the C64. But it's also quite difficult and slowly. Shooters could maybe be written using SEUCK. Or it's possible just changing the GFX and sprites from other games.<br />Currently I'm using tools on Windows. Also few good (free) software for that.

And the platformers can also be made quite easily. The 194x shooters are very simple and I don't like them.<br />It's not the same as real emulating but it's at least possible to have a feeling what the console, some games and sound is like.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Now Porchy from JAMMArcade.net has dumped some games. He owns 13 games, looks like no multi carts.<br /><br />He used female (?)  jumper wires to attach to the slot pins and 74HC4040. To me it doesn't look like if they are enough wires. And on the upper slot pins row he has 2 rows of jumpers attached, I wonder how he had managed that (PINS bent? Soldered?) Oh, I forgot. There are 4 rows.<br /> But he claims to have dumps and saw all the game graphics. Nothing much shown other than the previously known header data.<br /><br />He also doesn't have released the ROM contents and he obviously can't write an emulator.<br /><br />But there is at least hope, that he donates the ROM data to MESS or somewhere else.<br /><br />If I had detailed schematics, complete PIN layout and dumping software, I maybe retry it with my multicarts or maybe send my carts. But without an emulator it doesn't make much sense, except for having all graphics and maybe find the sound data.<br /><br />Does anybody know him? Or can post this on the MESS forum?<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.jammarcade.net/dumping-gameking-cartridges/">http://www.jammarcade.net/dumping-gameking-cartridges/</a><!-- m -->

And can test and compare it. Otherwise it won't be possible to write any emulator for unknown stuff. Or need for in-circuit testing?<br /><br />The ROM data consists of 6502 code, GFX and sound and maybe some other data and logic tables.<br />If you have the GFX, what is the case and can also extract the uncompressed music and sound (not done yet?), the rest must be the gaming code what is probably very few parts of the data.<br /><br />There are some more bytes now dumped than the length of the previously known original header from Brian but the few bytes look like some more GFX, maybe a logo, and the few bytes don't help much. <br />I have to check the data with Brian's GFX tool and compare to 6502 code.<br />Dumping is the first step. And identifying and extracting the complete GFX and sound is very important. Even if you don't have the code, you can try to simulate and play with the GFX.<br />GFX encryption is fully known, Sound should be uncompressed  6 KHz. What else is needed?<br /><br />At least he managed to dump them. Knows the correct PIN layout, dumping software using an Arduino and some more details previously not known.

We don't know how the display is accessed, configured, or anything else. We don't know how it accesses the more-than-64KiB of data on the cartridge, or how it reads the joypad.<br /><br />All of this information can be determined either from the manufacturer, looking at existing games, or by exhaustively trying tests until it does something, in order of increasing frustration but also accuracy.

And the GameKing 3 color games ...<br /><br />Personally, I almost forgot it and am busy with something else.<br />All games are very difficult and you can't play very long with this device and that poor graphics.<br />More fun than playing is maybe the emulation work and developement of homebrew games.
