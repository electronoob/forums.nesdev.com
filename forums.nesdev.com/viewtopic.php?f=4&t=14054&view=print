		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For my latest side-project, I've started making boards for the Nintendo Playchoice-10.  This is the prototype of the first one.  This one is simply NROM, just 32kB PRG and 8kB CHR ROM or RAM.  Soon I'll make a GTROM/Cheapocabra for Playchoice, and possibly boards for other mappers that I'm working on.<br /><br />I thought I was done using through-hole parts, but I figured this would be a good way to use up my old inventory of EPROMs.<br /><br />In the past I experimented with replacing the security PROM with a CPLD, but this board doesn't need a PROM.  This is possible thanks to the assembler and documentation made by nocash, which makes it possible to create your own instructions screens.  No mods to the Playchoice system are needed.<br /><br />What I'd like to do now is start find at least 10 games so I can create a set that I can distribute to owners who will take them to conventions, or other public places.  If anyone is interested, let me know.  If you want to, feel free to include ordering info for an NES cart version of your game.  Though I supply NES boards and carts, it doesn't necessarily have to be anything that I'm involved with otherwise, I'd be happy to promote releases from other distributors/publishers.  If anyone wants to go beyond that and release it in general to anyone, that's always an option too.<br /><br />Playchoice is identical to NES.  If you didn't already know, it's based entirely on a timer rather than a credit system.  Here are some things to keep in mind:<br /><ul><li>RGB PPU palette is slightly different from NES</li><li>PPU &quot;emphasis&quot; bits can not be used (screen becomes grey)</li><li>game must start by the start button.  the system locks out the start and select buttons only, when there is no time/credits</li><li>in addition to the instructions, you need to specify the amount of time your game should run in attract mode.  there are 2 attract modes, first one is when the Playchoice simply cycles through all the games.  the second mode is if a (potential) player doesn't have any credits, but has used the game select button to select your game.</li><li>(edit)there is no start or select button for the 2nd player</li></ul><br />Also, if anyone is interested in releasing for this, but doesn't want to build the instructions ROM themselves, you could supply it to me as text and I could help with whatever formatting is needed and build the ROM.<br /><br /><img src="http://membler-industries.com/nes/pc10-px01.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />And no, it's a little amusing but I didn't write that &quot;SAMPLE&quot; on the connector.  It's pulled off an old scrap board, one of the benefits of working at an electronics company.

You don't even need a board for VS unless the game is larger than 32kB PRG / 16kB CHR, just 6 EPROMs for that size (the board is wired for 8kB ROMs).  VS games usually come with a marquee, if you go that route, I have access to a laser cutter if you need someone to cut plexiglass for you.  Then you'd just need artwork printed on translite of the same size, to have a nice-looking kit.  Since VS has all those different PPUs, you could consider doing what RBI Baseball does, and use the DIP switches so the user can select a palette to match their PPU.  I have a VS board and control panel if you ever need someone to test, it swaps easily into the Playchoice cabinet.  I only have the Playchoice PPU though, it also works on the VS and that's the one whose palette index matches the NES.<br /><br />A Playchoice version of the game would be very welcome too.<br /><br />I just got back from Midwest Gaming Classic in Milwaukee, showed off the proto board there to some interested folks.  At next years MGC I'm going to see if I can haul my Playchoice cabinet up there, or at least find someone local who has one, and load it up with homebrews.<br /><br />Including Clean-Up Crew, there are 5 games in the line-up already.

It's supposed to be arcade-style too and it would be cool to see it actually running on an arcade cabinet.

I assume that means the amount of time between the title screen and the start of the attract mode shouldn't be very long so the game can just get right onto the demo.<br /><br />Edit: Also, keep sound on during the attract? Or no sound? Or does the Playchoice take care of muting the NES during attract mode anyway?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I wouldn't be overly worried about every game having an attract mode, though it does make the game more attractive, heheh and might be fun to add.  Actually I should mention there is a major flaw with Playchoice freeplay mode, it doesn't run attract mode when the machine is in freeplay.  Only in coin-op mode, and when there are no credits/time.  But this doesn't have to be a permanent problem, I've been thinking about hacking the BIOS ROM to improve freeplay mode.  And attract mode sound, would be nice too if there was an in-between option to enable attract sound for a game every few minutes, instead of all-or-nothing.  But I'm a total Z80 newb so I can't exactly dive right into it.  It's always possible to wire up an external coin button too, though that's kind of ugly and the time-based credit system itself is annoying.<br /><br />If you guys are interested in how attract mode looks with normal Playchoice games, I could take a video of it running.<br /><br />One other fun thing that can be done with conventions or public locations, would be to check the Playchoice's bookkeeping feature.  It only tracks how many times each game has been accessed, and it's memory backed up by a capacitor instead of a battery, so I wouldn't expect to get data over long a long period of time or anything.  Plus, without a real attract mode, this is sort of a &quot;which game has the best-sounding name&quot;, unless the selection is being done by someone who is already familiar with the games.  Even so, it would be kinda neat to see which games get played the most.<br /><br />NovaSquirrel: Yep, that sums up attract mode.  Leave the sound on if you want, because one of the DIP switches on the mainboard is used for an attract mode sound disable.<br /><br />tepples: I do want to keep it going beyond 10 carts, at this rate I might have some hard decisions ahead if I can only show 10 at the next MGC (wouldn't be until April 2017).<br /><br />Tele-Viper: Can you get me the date(s) of when the possible showing(s) will be?  Also, do you know what specific Playchoice models they have?  So far it's been tested on the dedicated single-monitor (what I have), and the &quot;red tent&quot; VS conversion.  That leaves the dual-monitor Punchout conversion and countertop versions remaining to be tested.  Though I don't expect any problems, it'd be good to be certain that it works everywhere.  The Playchoice BIOS ROM has some unknown variations, at least one because I dumped mine and it's not in the MAME set, so I'm curious to see if there are more out there.

If it's not on free-play mode I wanted it to be more obvious that the game is paused so they'll go hit the start button again if they do it by accident.
