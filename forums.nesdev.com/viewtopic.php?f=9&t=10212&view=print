I'm looking to sell my NES PowerPak - would here be suitable place to try to do so?  eBay appears to frown on devices that are capable of facilitating piracy, despite the homebrew/dev potential.<br /><br />Thanks, Bob.

Shipping should not be too much, around 5-7â‚¬ from GB to Germany i think.<br />And indeed, it would ease up the process of testing my hacks on actual console, than having to set up my old laptop to burn tge eprom, what takes a long time than just copying to a CF <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

It uses SD rather than CF. They both support just about the same mappers. They in general, do the same thing. I like the EverDrive products. But I've had a PowerPAK for a long time. There is no reason for me to replace it with the N8 EverDrive. The one advantage I know of doesn't apply to me, it works on clones apparently. If all you have is a clone then N8 is for you. And ofcourse if your clone has swapped duty cycles, you could actually use the N8 to run patched ROMs that swap the duty cycles in software to match the duty cycle swap in hardware.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Only advantage I can think of is auto SRAM saving rather than holding the reset.  I wouldn't expect krikkz to expand the mapper support much, seems to be a few issues with games that don't work correctly even on mappers listed as working.  Although, to give it the benefit of the doubt it hasn't been on the market as long as the powerpak to get the compatibility better, but seeing krikkz's pattern of usually not supporting anything I doubt you'll see any improvement.  I'll be waiting for the powerpak 2.0 personally <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Krikzz does support his products. The only thing is that he has many products now. He can't be updating/adding features to all of them all the time. I would expect Krikzz will add more mappers. But in the end the two products are comparable. And isn't there supposed to be a PowerPAK 2 coming along with new features?

The last ones I got I found in a &quot;as is&quot; bin for a pretty low price. I only got 2 because I didn't want to risk spending more money on garbage. Both appear to work fine though.
