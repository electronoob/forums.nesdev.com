At least so have been my experiences as a computer repairman and seller past few years. I sometimes took liberties of trying some of my own devices on these modern computers and I cannot say there were any problems. I did only use a boot CD though.

This is a total misunderstanding.</strong><br /><br />Then, yes I am upset about the usage of parallel port, yes, for the simple reason it's hard to find PCs with them, and if you find a PC with one, it's <em>extremely</em> hard to make it work.<br /><br />Under any Windows more recent than 98 (and who still uses 98...) you need the special .dll files to have any hope to acess the LPT, and even then it will randomly fail because your motherboard is form brand X instead of brand Y, etc...<br /><br />The reason why I reacted so was because of my last attempt at using a parallel port to communicate with the Commodore-64 disk drive to test my programs developed on my PC on my C64. <strong>This ended up being a complete waste of time because nothing worked at all and all transfer programs were dating from 1992 or so, and were completely unusable as of the 200X years.</strong> This is where my hatred towards parallel ports comes from. Eventually I was able to use a fake tape cassette in order to download data from the sound jack of my PC, works flawlessly. It can't write disks but at least it's a simple and reliable way to download a program into the C64 from a PC.<br /><br />Now if someone can proof me otherwise that it's easy to access to PCs which are more recent than 2000 and have parallel port, and that access them with Windows 7 (or even XP), or any common Linux distro, without reinventing the wheel and rewrite your own OS/Kernel/Drivers yourself, then I'm all ears.<br /><br />Yes USB is complicated to use and yes it's not easy, however at least it's modern and widely supported. You can get microcontrollers with embedded USB interfaces, or a regular microcontroller with software support of USB with open source and free software available on the internet. I used such a program once at my work, so I know it is possible, and on a tiny AVR micro with only 8 pins !<br />Thanks to interrupt they can both listen to USB and do something else at the same time if programmed right.<br /><br />Of course I'd do such a device myself if I could the problem is that the timing from the FDS drives are a total mystery for me and I have no hope of doing it right.<br />In the end I am very glad for Chris's hard work and I hope it will be useful for me one day, but as long as you can't get rid of the LPT, I can't see myself successfully using it.</div><br />blah blah blah....<br /><br />One question - did you paid for that programms? If answer is &quot;NO&quot;, why do you complaining?<br /><br />Thinkpad T20 made in 2001 have parallel port.<br /><br />Microcontroller and FDS? Ask kyuusaku, he is not clueless, but kinda f***ed up, guess why?<br /><br />P.S. Yum-yum-yummy thread

Someday if I get experiments working right, I'll get FDS uploading with only the Famicom mic and a loudspeaker.<br /><br />If you want a microcontroller solution, that's in quite the opposite direction of purpose as TapeDump.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm satisfied with my choice of cable using the parallel port because:<br /><br />1) Software to upload files already exists (DTVTrans)<br />2) Parport is easily accessible by hobbyists (Wikipedia says: &quot;For electronics hobbyists the parallel port is still often the easiest way to connect to an external circuit board.&quot;<br />3) It at least WORKS on my computer, while FDSLoadr never did.

A microcontroller itself is not expensive, but it's true that programming it is another story and this is impossible without &quot;expensive&quot; equipment.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think use of parallel port these days is a poor choice if one wants one's device to work with people's machines here. I wouldn't go out and buy another PC and deal with all the headaches of that just to use some piece of hardware, or even restrict my choice of PC, when there are easy and flexible alternatives over USB (Teensy comes to mind). Of course if the software is written reasonably cleanly, it wouldn't be hard to modify it to use a Teensy.

Seriously.<br /><br />I'm sorry for the harsh attitude, but I am so disappointed I can't remain polite in such circumstances.</div><br /><br /><br />Cry me a river. I have an Asus PX79LE that didn't come with one, so I got a PCI Parallel Port card that I checked to make sure it specifically supported all protocols. Works great. I also got an Adaptec SCSI card WITH DB25 SCSI port and an ATA card with IDE ports. I have a Belkin USB to serial which I use to console into Cisco Routers using a Rollover cable, and also works great with my C64TPC box which I used to load disk images on my C64. You CAN find USB adapters that support all the right protocols but, you just have to look around. Don't just buy any old cheap POS adapter from china and expect it to work with everything you throw at it. So if I can find these adapters all for under 50 bux each its really not that big of a deal.<br /><br />If you want an IEEE1284 Card that is worth your money get a &quot;2S1P Combo-Value&quot; by SIIG It is fully compliant with IEEE 1284-1994 parallel port standard and supports ECP, EPP, PS2 and SPP modes.<br /><br />or go to the local thrift store and get an old computer with all that stuff on it for next to nothing.<br /><br />There... I just completely invalidated your entire argument.

The hard drive may well stop running after a decade of continuous use—they're often rated for 100k hours—but for anything that's been in safe storage, I'ven't had much difficulty coaxing old machines to life.

Copying data onto and off of an obsolete computer requires either a network or a removable storage device, and these removable storage devices tend to be incompatible between decades-separated computers as well: 5.25&quot; disks to 3.5&quot; disks to USB flash drives, or ATA to SATA hard drives. Even storage devices with their own controller cards aren't always compatible, as controller cards shift from ISA to PCI to PCIe.
