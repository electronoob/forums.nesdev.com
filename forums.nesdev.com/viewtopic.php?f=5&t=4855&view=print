		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This has nothing to do with NES-dev, but some people here seems to be quite involved in GBA-dev, and the GB sound hardware is very similar to NES. (no matter how much people will come here and straight listing the numerous differences).
<br />
<br />As people may or may not know, because the GBA has GB/GBC backwards compatibility, the sound hardware for GB/GBC which consist of 4 PSG channels (two square wave channels, one customizable wave channel and one white noise channel), is also available from the GBA side. To allow more evolved synthetic music two other channels are at disposeal and games could mix several software sampled channels in them.
<br />
<br />While many games uses those 2 latter channels extensively to get SNES-like quality sound, there is also a surprisingly high number of games who makes a limited usage of them and uses the old 4 channels from the original GB to do their music and/or sound effects. This make some games sound retro and have that unique GBA sound that mixes GB and SNES quality sound.
<br />
<br />So I'd like people to list here GBA games that does a good usage of the old GB channels despite the presence of the new GBA channels.
<br />
<br />- Mega Man Battle Network series : Almost all music of the whole series is done mainly with the old channels for melodies and basslines, only some drums and synth typically done with the GBA channels. Only a minority of songs in the series have their melody on new channels. Not only that but many sound effects uses the old channels too, awesomely. They do clever volume enveloppe and pitch effects that push the old channels to their limits.
<br />
<br />- Mega Man &amp; Bass : Despite the original music being on the SNES, they used the old channels for all baselines and many melodies, keeping other things inchanged. There is also many volume and pitch effects. It sounds really great, in fact the bassline sometimes sounds even better than the original SNES music. However they didn't use the old channels for sound effects.
<br />
<br />- Sword of Mana : Old channels used extensively in music, but they didn't feel like using them too much either which is good. And *all* sound effects of the game uses the old channels exclusively. There lacks some really good effects in the music (no vibratoes or pitch effects), but the sounds effects are really awesome so this is great anyway.
<br />
<br />- Dragon Quest Monsters - Caravan Heart : Minor usage of them in the music, but they are used again for *all* sound effects on the game, and as this is the tradition in the Dragon Quest series, all sound effects must sound like the original NES. The usage of old channels makes it sound much more accurately like the original NES than what you can hear on other Dragon Quest games released on modern systems.
<br />
<br />- Fire Emblem serires : The music doesn't use the old channels at all, but several sound effects does and it sounds really exiting, especially the critical hit SFX that sounds incredibly extiting, and would not sound that good with the new channels.

Drum and slap-bass are PCM, as are the sound effects, but the melody is mostly PSG. This was done partly to save battery life and partly to increase compatibility. Loading the entire program into RAM means the GBA memory controller doesn't spend power toggling bits on the Game Pak interface. Mixing fewer channels uses less CPU time, letting the CPU go to a sleep mode with an BIOS call that acts like HLT on GB or WAI on SNES. Programs that load into RAM can also run on the GBA Movie Player, a cheap CF adapter that was popular for some time in the GBA's life.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.pineight.com/lj/" class="postlink">Lockjaw</a>, for much the same reasons. The sound effects were intended to resemble those of the PC version, many of which sounded like NES on purpose. (<strong>ObNES:</strong> Writing this game's sound effect engine gave me the confidence to write one for Tetramino for NES. In fact, once I showed Tetramino 0.33's new sound effects engine to my cousin, the first thing out of his mouth was "it sounds like Lockjaw.")<br />&lt;/toot&gt;<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">- Sword of Mana : Old channels used extensively in music, but they didn't feel like using them too much either which is good.

<br />But then Sword of Mana was originally a Game Boy mono game called Final Fantasy Adventure. Are the PSG sound effects taken directly from FFA, or are they new?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@DWedit : You are right, Lufia seems to use the PSG channels well for sounds effects and sometimes music but without being over-used.
<br />
<br />@Tepples : You sure have guts to claim your own games to make one of the best use of the GBA PSG channels. Anyway, I didn't know you could save battery life by loading the game in internal RAM and using the PSG channels so you're forgiven.
<br />
<br />Also it seems that in one of your games you were able to simulate 2 channels on channel 3 by having a waveform that sounds like a chord, this is probably what I'd call a good use of the GBA PSG channels. In fact it's probably only possible to do that to play a 4th (having one waveform that repeats 4 times and another 3 times combined) and to play a 5th (having one wavefrom that repeats 2 times and another 3 times combined). Or an octave obviously but that's not really 2 notes.
<br />
<br />The original GameBoy have theorical stereo capability (altough it's only availale on the *very* noisy headphone jack), and all sounds effects, graphics and gameplay freatures in Sword of Mana are original, and the fact SFX are done on PSG have nothing to do with the original FFA.
<br />
<br />The story is from FFA, and somes music were remixed for the GBA (with new instruments, not exclusively PSG) while some music is original. The "sleep" music is entierely PSG but it is a different one than the one in FFA (it's not very good to have only PSG by the way, the best is a mix of both in my opinion).
