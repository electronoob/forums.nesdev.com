The only thing I can think that could cause compadability issues is the pitch.  The pitch could be an issue on some systems and not others if the free play of the card edge and connector is greater or the pins are wider.  <br /><br />There are literally no components required to make the conversion, but I think I've seen some that had a few components.  Either way I'd be suprised if that could be the issue that causes problems with specific consoles not specific games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Tue Aug 09, 2011 2:41 am</p><hr />

A company called Xinga used to sell 72-to-60 pin converters for around $1 each, that was 6 or 7 years ago and that product seemed to have been discontinued when I checked last.  It was just a bare PCB, not in a housing like that one you found, but I've only seen pictures of it.  I would have stocked up on those if I had money then (would be nice addition to any NES devkit).<br /><br />It looked pretty cool until I saw the disclaimer, I can't help but LOL that it's a NES-to-Famicom converter that isn't compatible with a real Famicom or a specific accurate clone (the GameAxe).

I'm curious about them.  Not only if they are 2.50mm pitch but I'd be concerned how easy it is to interface with.  I doubt there are PCB style easily soldered pins on the other side.  <br /><br />But if you're lucky it will be better than the mobo side of a front loader's 72pin connector.  That is an option I've used before on the 60 pin side of my 60 to 72 pin converter.  But it's kinda a hack job to get it to work and mounted well, hopefully you don't have that issue with this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Mon Aug 08, 2011 6:25 pm</p><hr />

Hey guys, I am not sure if you are aware but Stone Age Gamers carry a 72 pin to 60 Pin adapter to play NES cart on Famicom and the connector could potentially be removed to be used on NES related project. I tought some of you might be interested as those adapter are 9.99$ and I know the connector is pretty hard to find. I can't comment yet about the pitch used but I have ordered one to take a better look at them. Some will most likely find that paying 10$ for a connector is alot but at least it could be a potential source that wouldn't involve destroying a game genie or cutting and fiddling with computer edge connector to make them almost the right pitch. And for small personnal project, 10$ would be acceptable for me.<br /><br /><a href="http://stoneagegamer.com/nestofamicomconverter72-pinto60-pin.aspx" class="postlink">http://stoneagegamer.com/nestofamicomconverter72-pinto60-pin.aspx</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4859">SkinnyV</a> — Mon Aug 08, 2011 8:47 am</p><hr />
