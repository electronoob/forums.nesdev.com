Correct.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that your emu must set the I flag in the status register on IRQ (and NMI).  After the status reg is pushed to the stack, of course.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Thu Dec 11, 2008 6:47 am</p><hr />

Thanks again for answering, so let me see if I understand it properly, the IRQ handler should not touch the IRQ asserting flags, only go to the IRQ vector in the memory, it is up to the programmer of the game to read $4015 and such to clear the IRQ to move on, or the else the IRQ flags will keep getting the IRQ handler to be executed. Is this a right way to look at it?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3551">qeed</a> — Thu Dec 11, 2008 6:36 am</p><hr />

IRQ summary: The CPU normally executes instructions sequentially. If the I flag in the CPU's status flags is clear, and anything is asserting IRQ, then the CPU will divert execution to the IRQ handler after the current instruction finishes. Once the IRQ handler is begin, the I flag is set so it won't get stuck infinitely re-entering the IRQ handler. The device that is asserting IRQ won't know the CPU entered the IRQ handler, so it will still be asserting it. Thus, the IRQ handler code must tell the asserting device to stop, otherwise once it clears the I flag, the IRQ handler will be re-triggered again. So, in the descriptions of the APU, it simply describes what things cause the IRQ to start being asserted (for example, the frame IRQ), and what things end assertion (for example, reading the status register to clear the frame IRQ). The APU keeps track of the various IRQ sources separately, even though they are all ORed together before being sent to the CPU.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Wed Dec 10, 2008 9:38 pm</p><hr />

"Acknowledging" an IRQ is like telling the hardware to stop asserting the IRQ.<br /><br />An easy way to abstract and visualize this is to imagine every IRQ-generating source has a "pending" flag.  When an IRQ is tripped, all that happens is the Pending flag is set.  When the IRQ is acknowledged, the Pending flag is cleared.  And if at any time, <em>any</em> Pending flag anywhere on the system is set, this indicates that the CPU should IRQ.<br /><br />To clarify further:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">void AcknowledgeFrameIRQ&#40;&#41;<br />&#123;<br />  // called when APU Frame IRQ is acknowledged<br />   frameirq_pending = false;<br />&#125;<br /><br />void TriggerFrameIRQ&#40;&#41;<br />&#123;<br />  // called when an APU Frame IRQ has been triggered<br />  frameirq_pending = true;<br />&#125;<br /><br />bool ShouldIRQ&#40;&#41;<br />&#123;<br />  // called between instructions to see if the CPU should do an IRQ<br />  if&#40;frameirq_pending&#41;   return true;<br />  if&#40;dmcirq_pending&#41;  return true;<br />  if&#40;mapperirq_pending&#41;  return true;<br />  if&#40;anyotherirq_pending&#41;  return true;<br /><br />  return false;<br />&#125;<br /></div><br /><br />This isn't practical code, of course.  I'm just trying to illustrate the concept.<br /><br />Note that the IRQ itself does not aknowledge any IRQs!  Therefore if a game RTIs from an IRQ without acknowledging the IRQ, another IRQ will happen immediately because the same one is still pending.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />As for the DMC output unit, which register is the one that is playing, the 8 bit right shift register since it says the sample is 8 bit too, if that is the case, what does the delta counter do?<br /></div><br /><br />Basically... the contents of $4011 <em>is</em> the output of the DMC.

Thanks for answering guys! I have the timer implemented now and am facing the issue of the frame irq flag, dmc irq flag, DMC output unit, and $4011. In the wiki, it says that reading $4015 clears the frame interrupt flag but not the dmc interrupt flag, does that mean if the CPU will still execute an IRQ if there is one set by DMC when the sample reading is done? (assuming that frame interrupt flag already set too, when $4015 reading takes place). Also I didn't quite understand what "At any time, if the interrupt flag is set, the CPU's IRQ line is continuously asserted until the interrupt flag is cleared. " meant. Could you please elaborate. As for the DMC output unit, which register is the one that is playing, the 8 bit right shift register since it says the sample is 8 bit too, if that is the case, what does the delta counter do? Finally, the $4011, when does the counter sometimes fail to be loaded by $4011, should i ignore the sometimes failing case in my emulator. Sorry for the torrent of questions in one post, but I think its better than posting many times.

Since bytes remaining is zero, <a href="http://nesdevwiki.org/wiki/APU_DMC" class="postlink">the memory reader doesn't do any filling</a>. This results in the sample buffer becoming empty, which causes the output unit to set the silence flag and stop changing the DAC value. The DAC value doesn't get 0, it keeps getting whatever it was getting before. Again, you have to adopt different thinking for hardware than for software; in software, you'd logically stop doing all these things if the DMC wasn't playing a sample, but in hardware, you do the smallest thing that stops sample reading and playback (unless you're going for low-power design, of course). In this case, that means simply clearing the bytes remaining counter.<br /><br />The DMC is quite complex. I think all its behavior is covered on the Wiki page, but it's difficult to keep it all in mind at once, so ask further questions if necessary.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Mon Dec 08, 2008 10:13 pm</p><hr />
