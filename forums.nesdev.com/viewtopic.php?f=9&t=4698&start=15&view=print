<br />
<br />I did a pseudo-scientific test today. It seems to be working!
<br />
<br />I made up two versions of the same circuit. One used several logic gates and flip flops, and the other used a CPLD with the same parts coded in Verilog. I looked at both with my logic analyzer. If the 3.3V signals weren't enough to trigger logic on the 2A03, the chip would've screeched to a halt. Instead, it kept running as long as I checked it (a few times over a couple hours). 
<br />
<br />Here is the discrete logic version:
<br /><img src="http://www.skrasoft.com/blog/blogfiles/2A03/2A03glue.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />...and here is the 3.3V CPLD version:
<br /><img src="http://www.skrasoft.com/blog/blogfiles/2A03/2A03cpld.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />They are running at different speeds intentionally. The CPLD version is clocked at 20MHz, and the glue logic version is running at NES speed. 
<br />I'm not sure why there is such a difference on the address pins when R/W goes low, but it doesn't seem to affect performance. I don't really know why the processor is trying to write at all, but it comes up in both circuits.

<br />
<br />whoa! it works on Linux and OSX too, but only 8 inputs and 24MHz? Know a better one that might work on a machine I own (I use Linux and OSX so either one). It would be nice if I could do more like 24 inputs and capture writes to mapper registers for example. 
<br />
<br />I do have a use for the Saleae at work just for doing I2C, SPI, rs232 and MMC/SD, so I'm tempted to get one anyways.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for confirming that.  I've suspected it would work.  I figured that'd be kinda wrong for it to be the regular NMOS since many (most?) carts used CMOS parts entirely and Nintendo's hardware seems to be pretty much "by the book". (though I suppose it is "the book" for me, since that's what I've learned based on, heheh)
<br />
<br />Now I wonder if the PPU is the same, in light of this though, I'd say almost certainly.  Now, if only more parts had 5V tolerant inputs. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />I'm still looking for something affordable that has 32 channels, 200+ MHz, and any kind of memory buffer. It seems like the only real solutions for that are closer to $1000.
<br />
<br />I almost bought the LA1034 LogicPort by Intronix, but I did the calculations and it can only record about 20 microseconds of a 100MHz clock.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since you can use CPLD, why not make your own logic analyzer with a synchronous SRAM? For ~$8 you can get a 200MHz 4M one (128K x 36 bit) in a TQFP100 package from Digikey no less. This is what I plan to do someday when I finally get around to projects needing a real LA.

<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.byteparadigm.com/product-gp-24200-21.html" class="postlink">Byte Paradigm</a> started putting 8MB buffers in all their portable LAs. I haven't tried them, but they looked pretty impressive for around $800-1200 when I checked them out at the recent ESC tradeshow. But I think they are only able to sample 16-bit I/O.
<br />
<br />Also interesting is the <a href="http://www.saelig.com/miva/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=PSPC019&amp;Category_Code=" class="postlink">CircuitGear oscope</a> which can sample 8-bits and also generate arbitrary wave forms. For around $180 it's more in my price range, but then it's even slower than the Saleae.
<br />
<br />Is it really possible to cheaply make a LA out of a CPLD some SRAM and maybe a micro to provide USB access to the buffer? anything 24-bits or more for under $500 would suit me at almost any speed! I'll even write the USB drivers myself if I have to.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Sure, there's even a popular open project in Japan called ChameleonUSB which is basically a CPLD and Cypress MCU with IDC headers. It has a 100 MHz 32-channel Logic Analyzer attachment which is just a "PBSRAM" and protection resistors. The author also sells them, but getting one might be difficult without a friend in Japan. I believe it should come to under US$150 though if you chose to buy it with the 4M Logic Analyzer.

<br />
<br />Thats the one I have, its good for the price.  Limited recording is a problem but it does on device compression so if you have only a couple signals or they don't change often then you can get very long sampling.  Software has pretty good edge/level triggering.  Only having a USB cable is great too.

<br />You can get the ChameleonUSB on Yahoo Japan auctions too, I've also seen the logic analyzer pop up on there a few months ago. I got my ChameleonUSB from there.
