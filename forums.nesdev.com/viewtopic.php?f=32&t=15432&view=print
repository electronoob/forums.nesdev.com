	</div><br />Health and family issues almost put paid to my plans to participate in this compo, but I've finally got something to show. No idea if I'll be able to finish it in a week but I'll damn well try. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Wrecking Balls is a straightforward four-player versus game based on the legendary Bomberman, squeezed into 16K NROM w/ CHR-RAM. D-pad to move, A button to drop bombs. Blow up walls to get more and bigger bombs, and blow up the other players to win! Credit to WheelInventor for graphics, animations, hardware testing and a whole lot of patience, among other things.<br /><br />Skull items currently do nothing, and it's fixed to four players no matter how many controllers are connected, but otherwise it's fully playable. It should work with both the Four Score and Famicom expansion ports. It's probably also loaded with bugs, so please bash on it and tell me what breaks.<br /><br />There is currently no sound or title screen. We're working on it. A level editor is also planned, with battery-backed saving (which obviously won't work on the compo cart even if we do make the deadline).<br /><br />No ASM was harmed or used in the making of this ROM.

Right now (speaking only for my part in the project), i feel we're just aiming at getting stuff in place and in good shape for the compo, but then who knows? It's cool that there seems to be some movement towards expanding the more than two players portion of the NES library.<br /><br />edit: re: name and game<br />aww, that's a bummer. :/ <br /><br />I just read up on it, they acquired the rights to the original series and name in 2012. Bomberland came out for C64 in 2013. Someone published a game called BomberMan in 2014. I don't get why one would want to choose such a close match of a name. Then there's Bombing Bastards for the Wii U store.

The volume column will eventually get instrumentalized to fit Rahsennors' native driver. .ftm song data size 1271; might shrink some in the conversion process. A full loop is ~60s at speed 3 (standard); 80s at speed 4 (heavy).
