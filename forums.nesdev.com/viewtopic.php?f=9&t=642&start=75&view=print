There is another free PC emulator that I can't remember right now.  I've used it on Linux and it works nicely.  It has ports to Windows too.  I think that the best bet is to open source the PC-side software, so that it can, unofficially, be ported to more modern operating systems.

(My two 250GB RAID 0 drives are formatted for NTFS, but there is 16MB of unformatted space which would be perfect when combined with a CD of NES ROMs.)  Whenever you needed to use CopyNES, simply use a bootdisk.  Not the most convenient solution, but it will have to do for us advanced folks until someone writes an app that will support parallel ports in Win XP.

<br />The source has ALWAYS been open - the client program is written in [uncompiled] QBASIC, and there will soon be a Win32 version available as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />On a related note, I've run into the exact same issues with my prototype dumper (CopyCart).  I've gone with a USB interface which hopefully still will have a lot of life in it, certainly more than parallel or serial ports.  Also, I've written the PC side of the dumping software in Python.  That way, it's 100% portable between linux and windows (and probably a lot more).  Python is slow, but performance isn't an issue.
<br />So what I'm saying is, it would be nice to have someone make an implementation in Java/Python or some other platform independent language.  If I had a CopyNES I would volunteer, but my dumper is taking up all my time right now.

AFAIK, parallel port support is only available under Linux,  Linux people have been using it for parallel-JTAG software that is Windows only.  I have an old copy of Windows 98 SE floating around my house somewhere.  I am going to try my GBX first.
<br />
<br />Windows XP users might want to check out QEMU to see if they can parallel support working.

<br />
<br />I'm just wondering, since a lot of hardware engineering folk -- even in 2005 -- still swear by the parallel port (which is being phased out, as we can see from the removal of legacy devices on some present-day motherboards).
<br />
<br />Just curious.

If you want to transfer data or do computer-&gt;device you need to write your own operating system specific drivers which is far harder than interfacing with the parallel port.  It used to be very easy to program the serial and parallel ports, Windows just makes it harder for no reason. 
<br />
<br />My off topic problem with the CopyNES right now is that my keyboard stops working when a program is run in a dos window!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The reason the parallel port is used is because it's really easy to program it.  USB isn't excessively difficult, but it certainly takes some study time.  Also, dealing with the PP is very low level - write to a port and flip an io pin.  USB is abstracted away pretty far by the OS, so you need to deal with some higher level abstractions (endpoints, interfaces, devices etc.).  Lots of low level programmers/hardware people just don't want to spend the time to learn that stuff because it's not very interesting to them.

<br />There are however USB &lt;-&gt; ISA translators which may do the trick, not sure if anyone's tried that route.
<br />
<br />Really though, if your computer doesn't have a parallel port, there are always PCI parallel ports... IMO, the only excuse why you shouldn't have a parallel port is if you own an Apple, someone should really develop a universal PCI-X card thinking of the future.

<br />Don't be so quick to dis Mac owners. Several Nintendo products have used the same CPU as an Apple product: <ul><li>The NES used a "2A03" CPU with a 6502 core (minus decimal mode) and some custom I/O; the 6502 was used in the Apple II, II+, and original IIe computers. I learned 6502 assembly language on an Apple II. </li><li>The Super NES used a CPU with a 65C816 core and some custom I/O; the 65C816 was used in the Apple IIGS computer. Nintendo built the first Super NES devkit around an Apple IIGS because it had a stable 65C816 assembler. </li><li>The Game Boy Advance uses a CPU with an ARM7 core, and the Nintendo DS CPU has two cores, an ARM7 and an ARM9. The iPod music player and the Newton PDA have also used ARM cores. </li><li>The GameCube uses a "GEKKO" CPU with a PowerPC G3 core and some custom I/O; the PowerPC G3 was used in several Macintosh models. </li><li>The Nintendo Revolution will use a "BROADWAY" CPU which includes some sort of PowerPC core and some custom I/O. </li></ul> Outside of Nintendo: <ul><li>Sega Genesis used the same off-the-shelf Motorola MC68000 processor as the original Apple Macintosh. </li><li>Atari Jaguar and Sega Saturn used this same processor as an I/O processor. </li><li>Sega Dreamcast uses an ARM7 similar to the GBA's to control the audio DSP. </li><li>Microsoft Xbox 360 has three dual-thread PowerPC cores. The first Xbox 360 devkit was made of Mac hardware. </li><li>The "Cell" in Sony PS3 has one dual-thread PowerPC core and seven DSPs. </li></ul>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />How was I dissing Apple? I've had a love/hate relationship with Apple computers over a decade/over half my life. I have no idea why you felt the need to make a CPU list, are you implying Apple are CPU trendsetters for consoles? That might be the case or it might be coincidence, it's totally irrelevant. Not related but when Apple finally makes the switch to IA64 what will that mean to you? heh
<br />
<br />I suggested the PCI-X card because I really do think someone should develop a parallel port compatible with modern computers (including Apples), it'd be one more push for me towards getting a G5 should uCON64 support that parallel port.
<br />
<br />PCI parallel ports can be easily had for less than $20 shipped. I don't know what aspect makes one quality, all PCI cards I've seen are EPP compliant, it either works or it doesn't. If someone has a PC without integrated parallel port or a free PCI slot, they may want to reconsider their PC if they intend to interact with legacy hardware. 
<br />
<br />I'm personally adamant about parallel ports because I use the parallel port to communicate with dozens of backup devices and with 5 or 6 other devices which I cannot afford overpriced USB counterparts of such as my JTAG cables.
