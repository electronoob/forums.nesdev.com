Disch, what's a ROM hacker? Bregalad "hacked" Contra's japanese version from Konami VRC to Nintendo MMC3. He also was working on doing a similar hack for Gradius 2. Seems much like real hacking to me. <br /><br />But I do think that it helps to disasm games and make fully commented and buildable source code, if you can spare the huge amount of time it takes to do that. In the end it's up to who does it if it is worth the effort and time to them. Personally I wouldn't bother with that sort of effort unless I planned to do some huge hack of the game myself. <br /><br />I do think it is helpful to see how some games did various small parts of the game so that homebrew developers can benefit from that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Mon Feb 23, 2009 1:21 pm</p><hr />

Examining other game's sources can be a very useful tool.  I can't tell you how much examining other emulators' sources have helped when making my first emulators.  And seeing how a game does a specific effect, or how it handles specific edge cases, or how it stores certain information, etc, etc, can all be useful to know when designing your own game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Mon Feb 23, 2009 11:20 am</p><hr />

What could be more useful to a ROM hacker than having complete details on every aspect of the target game?  Doppleganger's SMB disassembly has been put to wide use in ROM hacking circles (hell even I've used it on more than one occasion to find a few things and I don't even hack SMB).<br /><br />ROM hacking isn't really about cloning a game or making a new game from scratch.  It's about changing an existing game.  I think that's where your views seem to differ.  If someone's goal is to code a game from scratch, then yes -- a disassembly of a similar game probably isn't the greatest thing in the world (but I certainly wouldn't call it "useless" in any event).  But to a ROM hacker just looking to change one or two things (or even to radically overhaul lots of stuff), there is no greater tool.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Mon Feb 23, 2009 10:28 am</p><hr />

Well, to be honnest I could say a few things.<br /><br />Dissasembly of games we don't have acess to the souce can be usefull to see how some games did some tricks that you couldn't think off by yourselves. Also it's great to have dissasembly for ROM hackers who wants to change one thing or two in the source code. However, full disasemblies are very hard to provide, and are completely useless. If I were to have to clone SMB3, I think it would probably be easier to re-write everything from scatch than trying to disasebly everthing and to understand how it works. Because some parts of the code (those who are close to the hardware and those who are close to data in a friendly formatted format) are easy to understand, you'll have to admit it would take ages to understand what other piece of code could do.<br /><br />The fully commented of SMB disassembly is nice, but is completely useless when it comes to developping a game. You can see how the jump table tricks works which is interesting, but you didn't need to disassemble the whole game for that.<br /><br />So I say if you're bored and want to investigate in some project you may as well do something else cool like programming debugging or developping tools or programming games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Feb 23, 2009 10:06 am</p><hr />

I got some ideas from the RE docs of SMB, even though I don't code for NES.  For starters, my GBA game had a collision test loop that ran every object.  Even with sorting, it killed performance.  Then I decided to structure the object routines more like SMB and only tested collision when an object had to move (it takes place in a large scrolling room with lots of stuff, think SMB2/Doki Doki with 30 mushroom blocks in one room).  Also, jump tables!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3506">strat</a> — Sun Feb 22, 2009 8:36 pm</p><hr />
