<br />
<br /> You either switch out a small section of the name table memory - either by writing to CHR-RAM or using a mapper for CHR-ROM (with something smaller than 8k switchable). For Battletoads, I'm willing to bet the small strips on the side are dynamic tiles and the main section is a normal BG layout/scroll. There are quite a few other games that use the dynamic tile method.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I wouldn't say a <em>lot</em> of them do, but there are a number of them. The PCE can do single scanline hsync interrupts (on all 262 actually) and update X/Y regs without restraint. So hsync scrolls are easy to do without dynamic tiles, but some situations call for them - for complex overlapping parts, etc. Otherwise most games used sprites in combination with hsync interrupts for more complex multiscrolls. You'd figure since you can unlimitedly read/write to VRAM during active display on the PCE, there would be <em>more</em> instances of dynamic tiles.

<br />It's more likely that they used sprites in that case, since the GBA can support so many. Which area are you talking about, exactly?

<br />
<br />Yes in Crisis Force the trend in level 1 "appears" to scroll vertically being switching a CHR-ROM bank in sequence. It works out looking very cool, but it's a simple trick really. As others have said alot of older games used this trick. I first noticed this trick on Battletoads level 2.

<br />MottZilla were you around for me to show you the "Mosaic" demo i made back in 2000 or so?

<br />
<br />According to the NP comics, there were 3 developers of Battle Toads, whom are named in the comics, and claimed to have turned into the toads when during development of the NES game something goes seriously wrong. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />i'll get back to you on that once i find the correct issues of Nntendo Power in my collection to confirm if my memories match up with the actual comic series.
<br />
<br />if memory serves me Pimple and Rash are the two brothers and Zits is the 3rd developer.
<br />
<br />either that or Pimple and Zits are the two brothers and Rash is the 3rd developer.
