It's true that 64KB of RAM is a lot, and even when most of it is used for code and data, significantly more than 2KB should still be left for general use. On the other hand, since the NES runs games directly from ROM, you can have almost instant access to more than 64KB of code and data through bankswitching, and cartridges can easily pack extra RAM to compensate for those 2KB. However, AFAIK, the Commodore 64 can also use cartridges, in which case it could probably have these advantages too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Besides, did anybody ever actually run out of RAM space on the NES? You have 2048 bytes (minus 256 for sprites). This should be more than enough for every game.</div><br />That's... very optimistic of you. We know for sure that several developers back in the day felt like they needed extra RAM on the cartridge, not only the ones that needed battery backup. Sometimes the extra RAM may not be necessary, but it certainly makes things easier/faster. It's definitely easier to have unrestricted access to an entire level map in RAM than decode it on the fly from ROM and &quot;patch&quot; any changes they might have suffered in real-time. 2048 bytes is far from excessive if we're talking about 16-bit-type games. Varied enemies with complex behavior in large levels can quickly consume a lot of RAM. I particularly find it very fun to try and map all the functionality of 16-bit games to the constraints of the NES, and IMO, most of the time it can indeed be done, you just end up with a more complex program than if you had all the space in the world.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'm working on a full-blown &quot;Zelda&quot;-like adventure game</div><br />The original Zelda is a pretty early NES game, and the screen-by-screen gameplay is definitely a RAM saver. In my experience, the biggest RAM killers are level maps and objects, and neither of those are particularly troublesome if the map in question is only 1 screen large and all the objects are the ones inside it.

For instance, <a href="https://games.greggman.com/game/programming_m_c__kids/" class="postlink">an article by the programmers of <em>M.C. Kids</em></a> explains that without work RAM, the game might have needed smaller levels, possibly coarser destructibility, and certainly more programming complexity. Something like <em>SimCity</em> would be right out, as the prototype appears to need more than 32K of RAM: some for work RAM and some for save. The game's map alone is 120x100 spaces.

Most games don't. If you have up to 1.024 blocks (that's over 4 full screens worth of 16x16-pixel breakable blocks) you can save their existence state in 128 bytes, 1 bit per block. That does increase the complexity of the program though, because you have to treat breakable blocks as objects, and patch the level map cache accordingly, but it's doable. One advantage of treating breakable blocks as objects is that you can have complex backgrounds behind them, since the level maps are &quot;clean&quot; of breakable stuff.

Also the individual C64 channels officially doesn't have direct volume control (but with a trick they can have it).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you max out (and you're likely to), 4 is definitely more than 3. But at the same time considering the SID chip was much more flexible on what each channel could do (change roles, have a filter), you could make an interesting, varied and illustrative soundtrack in ways you can't on the nes. You're more likely to use two channels in order to sound like one more complex channel here and there on the NES, too. <br /><br />One example of the SID being more &quot;Illustrative&quot; would be comparing the &quot;scream&quot; effects in the intro song to <a href="https://youtu.be/QEjKPvk4rnw?t=43" class="postlink">ghouls n ghosts (c64)</a> to Shadax' scream in Solstice (NES), both by the same artist (uh, couldn't find an example of someone losing a life on youtube... oh well).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Home computers costed more than home consoles though, so they could afford to have more RAM. Or is there are reason why computers needs lots of RAM besides for disk loading (FDS only has 32 kB PRG-RAM and 8 kB CHR-RAM)? I'd think (arcade) games would be the most hardware demanding programs for a computer.<br />Nintendo wanted to make a home version of their arcade machines but that didn't cost as much so I guess they needed to cut down on things like RAM and colours.
