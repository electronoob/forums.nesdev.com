<br />CV3 isn't real hard until the last few levels. The western version makes you restart WAY before if you fail at fighting dracula which makes it it very hard, as opposed to the japanese version.

<br />The Japanese version is easier because some of the enemies do less damage.  That's the one I'm playing.  But I still can't get past level 7.  Those falling blocks are very annoying, but passable.  The farthest I've made it was the vertically scrolling screen near the end of the level, which is much harder than the corridor leading to Death in the first game.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" />

<br />I'm with Angry Videogame Nerd on CV2.  Great when it's a real Castlevania game, lousy for the quest stuff.

<br />
<br />I know.  The thread was about beating grim so I went back with the subject of the first CV since I'm not sure if the first one differ on FDS. I don't think so.  I was not aware of CV3 difference (never checked for it) since I only finished all the quests on the american version a long time ago as a kid.

<br />Well congratulations on that the last boss of CV3 is insane, especially in the western version where if you fail at it you are back to the last door WAY before the fight (so you'll reach dracula's room likely with not full-lifebar), and if game over (once every 3 lives) you have to re-do the whole last stage.
<br />
<br />In fact for both CV3 and CV4 I've been able to reach the last boss countless times, but never beat it without abusing save states. I find annoying games that have ridiculously hard last boss, on this side I like the Gradius/Contra formula better (very hard game, but ridiculously easy last boss).

<br />Hmm, I always have the easiest time with the "boomerangs."  I put that in quotes because they look like no kind of boomerang I've ever seen.

<br />It took Alucard's three-way shot, good timing, and luck for me to finally survive both forms.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had time today to try Castlevania on the train. I started to feel rusted when I arrived at the 3rd stage but after a few try I was fine. Then got stuck again a little bit with Frankenstein but was fine again.
<br />
<br />Finally the grim.  Took a few time, tried with the cross or axe but I decided to try it finally with the holy water this time.  I was able to get there with x3. For some reason,  I decided to throw water before he shows up. I don't know if it's a glitch or because I played it inside an emulator, he stayed there without throwing any projectile at all.  I think the projectiles were frozen on top of him. In the previous try (cross/axe), there was projectiles everywhere. I just spammed him with water and he died without a single projectile thrown.
<br />
<br />Now I'm at the last level.  I use save state at the beginning of the stage only since I cannot play it in one shot (no time) but never use them for restoring in the middle of a stage. No rewind too. If I die, I restart from beginning, like if it was the real thing.  I guess I should be able to finish it back again soon. I just requires to learn back the patterns. Once you know them, the game is not that hard actually.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, I won't be able to do the same with Castlevania 3 since the emulator on DS doesn't support it if my memory is good.

<br />
<br />And yeah that's what I said, if you have holy water death is a piece of cake (since he's basically frozen by it), else you can consider him impossible to beat. The problem is that it's very hard to make it in the boss room with holy water in your inventory.

<br />
<br />I think that was the 5th tips vid I ever did, so I wasn't used to editing yet and what-not... kinda sloppy : P
<br />
<br />Anyway, I learned of the way to fight Drac's second form with the holy water after the fact of making this video, so the old school way of using the boomerangs is what is in the vid.
<br />
<br />Here was ~1 min. video showing some short cuts to save time:
