When I click on a board or anything else sometimes I get logged out (but only if it's been a few hours since I last logged in, I think).  It's only slightly annoying.
<br />
<br />It doesn't happen to me on other sites using phpBB.
<br />
<br />There's also some oddities with using Zone Alarm and logging into NESWorld's forum (I have to shut down Zone Alarm to log in).  So I kinda wondered if it's related to something specific with the Parodius server (if that's even possible), or just a coincidence there.
<br />
<br />While I'm at it, can anyone recommend another cheap or free firewall?

<br />
<br />Reading the FAQ (<a href="http://www.phpbb.com/support/documents.php?mode=faq" class="postlink">http://www.phpbb.com/support/documents.php?mode=faq</a>) shows the following tidbits of help:
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You can increase the default length of sessions (ie. how long before a users session is considered 'dead') in Admin-&gt;General-&gt;Configuration-&gt;Cookie Settings-&gt;Session Length</div>
<br />
<br />If you set this number too high, I will kill you.  :D  I don't want to see sessions laying around on the filesystem for weeks at a time; and I won't resort to using mm to do sessions via SHM, because it'll simply grow Apache's process size over time...
<br />
<br />In addition, the authors of this software seem to the cookie based upon a combination of things -- including your IP number -- which completely fucks people visiting from dynamic IPs.  See FAQ section <em>My AOL based users keep getting logged out!</em>
<br />
<br />BTW, phpBB needs to be upgraded to 2.0.13 (security holes in both .11 and .12, including someone being able to gain administrative access).  :-)

<br />
<br />If money is a big stickler, and you'd prefer to use an actual PC for a NAT+fw unit (vs. an embedded device), you might consider SmoothWall.  I'm told the thing is *wonderful*, and from what little I've read about it, it seems to be so.

<br />I looked in the session length, it's 3600 seconds (so 60 minutes).  Seems to be pretty reasonable as-is.
<br />
<br />That router does sound pretty nice, I only use one PC though, so software ones seem to work well enough for now.

<br />
<br />This seems to be more of an issue for me now than it was back in March.  I find myself having to log onto these boards 4 times a day... even after checking the seemingly useless "automatically log in every time I visit" button.
<br />
<br />Can't we just stay logged in indefinitely?  Is there any way to remove the cookie expiration or whatever the problem is?

<br />I've had several users report this same problem on a board I run, and was never able to reproduce the error reliably. However, completely removing the cookies used for this board then re-logging in (and choosing to remain logged in) solved the issue for them. For now anyway.

<br />
<br />Smoothwall is decent, been awhile since I used it but I had it running on a AMD 386 dx 40 and it seemed to be keeping up. As long as the harddrive wasn't accessed to much anyway. But I thought I'd mention an alternative: Clarkconnect. Has (I think) many more features - it's basically a redhat (fedora) distro altered to be a NAT and..well go see if you want.

What's happening - are we spamming ads out for our anti-spam site?<br /><br />No. No way.<br /><br />There are two things that we have seen happen semi-regularly in the past.<br /><br />   1. Some ISPs, when they cancel a web site because the owner has spammed an ad for it, point the URL at an anti-spam site. We believe that this is done in order to help educate the general public about spam, and to show that the ISP is anti-spam. Unfortunately, because this is done with no explanation, it makes it look as if we spammed an ad linking to our site.<br />   2. Sometimes spammers get mad at anti-spammers and send out spam with the anti-spammer's name, address or web site in the spam. This is called a joe-job and some people take it as evidence that they've "arrived" as anti-spammers if someone joe-jobs them. It's done, of course, to try to create trouble for the person being joe-jobbed.<br /></div>
<br />Which of the two is the case here ?

I go to the main page, I'm logged in and see new message icons. Open each forum in separate tabs, and every one of them has me logged out. Close everything and open main page again and I'm logged out. Log back in and the next few visits work normally, then it happens again. This is the second or third time it's done it now. My phpbb2mysql_data cookie is still there, expires in a year. I just don't get it. Guess I'll just have to copy the login form to a local HTML file, fill in the username and password permanently, add some Javascript to auto-submit it when opened, then go to that page whenever I want to get to Nesdev.
