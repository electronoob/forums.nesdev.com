Hey people.  Looks like the game gods and goddesses chose to smile down upon me, maybe after I reminded them what a devoted follower Ive been, lol.  I CAN download .NES files and play them on this little contraption Ive been talking about!  I cannot as yet use the CD drive with a CD or DVD to play .NES roms, but, I can save the .NES roms onto a USB stick or SD card, and have the dvd player load them right from that...  And the emulation seems pretty good so far.  I think from what I have gathered, the cd-drive unit itself is a no go as far as individual files are concerned, because I think and it stands to reason that the hardware is seaching for a file structure matching that of you know - DVD, CD, VCD...  which has a certain architecture/standard.  Of course as most of you probably know a typical dvd player is not like a PC where you can explore through individual files of any extension, and view them up on a screen.  Anyway, it does work with USB/SD, which I am more than fine with.  Thanks for all your assistance and suggestions.  ALso some people on here might be interested in a little doo-dad I found on EBay, and even with worldwide shipping charges this thing is like 50 bucks.  <br />  <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://cgi.ebay.com/2-4-4GB-PMP-Game-Video-Camera-MP3-MP4-Player-4g-P1_W0QQitemZ260512605396QQcmdZViewItemQQptZOther_MP3_Players?hash=item3ca7c2e4d4">http://cgi.ebay.com/2-4-4GB-PMP-Game-Vi ... 3ca7c2e4d4</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4140">kidicarus</a> — Sun Dec 13, 2009 12:01 am</p><hr />

I'd really like as SNES PowerPak, but can't afford the taxes.<br /><br />I live in Brazil like Fx3 and had to pay the outrageous tax of 60% of the value of my NES PowerPak, and of course I wasn't happy at all. I don't expect to buy anything else from RetroZone because of this. Most sellers I dealt with saw no problem in declaring lower values for their products in hopes that they wouldn't be caught by customs (after all it's their product and they can sell for as much as they'd like... who can say the number in the paper isn't the true price?), but bunnyboy said he wouldn't do this. So yeah, for some people getting a PowerPak is quite a bit more expensive than for others.<br /><br />Hey Fx3, are you watching The Lost Canvas?

There are cards for your DS to let you play GBA-based and DS-based NES emulators.

Thanks for the info thus far.  I wanted to say that in 1985 my parents got me the Nintendo entertainment system with light gun, mario/duck hunt.  I was 10.  I still remember the price of that was 262 CDN, which would now be like, a thousand bucks.  Ive had 4 NES systems before, I was buying games as a teenager at 50 - 60 dollars each, I still have about 35 carts.  Thats some major money, but Im not trying to legitimize piracy in stating this, just trying to express to you all that I have in fact made a relatively significant contribution to the developmental causes of Nintendo throughout the years.  (not to mention 3 gameboys, 2 SNES, a DS, and dozens of games for those, and I still might buy a Wii)  Imagine spending 175 - 200 on a game right now, with the graphics and sound and so on of say... Lode Runner?  I still remember shelling out 110 for Street Fighter 2 turbo for SNES in 1991...  Holy crow, now I wish I saved all that for a house!  Just kidding. Anyway thats my waffle on down memory (card) lane.  That still doesnt mean I condone piracy, but I do admit it occupies somewhat of a gray area on my moral compass.  I do respect the rationale of restraint when it comes to issues of piracy.    Im gonna follow your guys advice and analyze the contents of these files in Hex editor, burn a CD and so forth, and report the results.  The crux of the thing I guess is that I hate playing console games on PCs, and Im reluctant to buy a Wii for the purpose of playing these old school titles, and this cheap little device seems almost perfect for me in this case, if I can get some other games to play on it.  Of course even if I cant, the thing is still cool enough for under a hundred buckaroos!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4140">kidicarus</a> — Fri Dec 11, 2009 10:00 pm</p><hr />

Well, you gotta find out how these BIN files are put together. The best thing you can do is compare the file of a common game with it's .NES counterpart and see what is different. Maybe the original ROM isn't even visible, maybe it's encrypted or something, in which case it will be much harder to reverse engineer.<br /><br />Transferring pirated games around here is not allowed, otherwise I would tell you to post one of the binary files so that other people here could take a look at it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Dec 11, 2009 1:45 pm</p><hr />

Yeah so it looks like the .NES rom is quite a bit smaller in size than the equivalent game file .BIN on the cd disc.  I take it then that the manufacturers of this aforementioned device didnt want eager beavers to put together their own playable game discs.  Poop.  But still theres got to be a way to do it, these guys couldnt have made it so amazingly hack proof that sufficient elbow grease cant get at it, I will research...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4140">kidicarus</a> — Fri Dec 11, 2009 1:27 pm</p><hr />

Hmmm, okay.  I got the HXD program, opened it up, loaded up balloon fight, which is not called balllon fight as the file name on the cd, instead its called:  G026.BIN.  Now, are the first 16 bytes displayed as the first line in the opened file in HXD? (The very first line reads - <br />Offset (h) 00 01 02 03 etc...)  The line directly beneath I guess is the first line , it starts with 00000000 then 3C 08 40 etc... and at the very right is closely spaced symbols and dots, &lt;.@.%.i...... so on.  But I do not see NES anywhere or 1A.  Balloon fight  is 96.0 KB, Super Mario is also 96.0 KB, and unfortunately the disc does NOT have mario bros (1) - too bad.<br />But it does have Goonies 2... sweet...  Also, Mega Man is called Rockman, which I believe is the Japanese name of that game.<br />Thanks<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4140">kidicarus</a> — Wed Dec 09, 2009 10:33 am</p><hr />
