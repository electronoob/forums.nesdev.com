There is no well working emulator.<br />The basic facts like the pinout is known and it should be easy. Not sure about if mapping, bank switching and thelike are the problems.<br />Can someone tell me if it's possible or too difficult. <br />Maybe with a Arduino. The Cartridges have 17 address lines and needs 3V (5V should be too high).<br />Any hints?

Last post mid 2011.<br />Do you think a professional game designer has the time and will send me schematics for a 10 year old project what he removed on purpose from the web? His 2 other SourceForge projects are still there but not this one.<br />Maybe he didn't made schematics.<br />I think I rather contact Lira Nuna. He even still collects that Cartridges in 2013.<br /><br />As I don't have much experience I think I would make it on a different way using a microcontroller instead of direct wiring. <br />There are many microcontroller dumping projects and there must be many folks around to know how to dump (any) ROMs if the pinout is known what is the case.<br />There are many Game Boy projects but I choose this board as the Famicom also has 60 pins.<br />I first considered buying a commercial product but I'm not sure if there's something what will do it without major changes for a reasonable price. So probably a microcontroller is the best way.

Smaller than 2^(24) addresses (16MB), and almost certainly 8-bit wide output, too.

Most dumping projects use an Arduina Mega which is expensive enough but it must work with boards with fewer ports by reading data in 2 parts (but needs additional electronics).<br />There is a Sega Genesis project  called Ardumpino including schematics and source code. Genesis has 23 lines and he used a small Duemilanove. The other problem is the voltage because I need 3V.<br />However I have to change the pinouts and dumping code. And need a 2x30 pin socket. It's not that easy. I've also seen projects using a modified cheap programmer. I think I have to ask some Arduino experts (or dumping experts).<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.brunofreitas.com/node/31">http://www.brunofreitas.com/node/31</a><!-- m --><br />The 2nd one looks even simpler without that many wires. I even have a similar controller. But I can't use that Genesis cartridge and have to built at least a cartrige adapter. Not sure about other issues like voltage and timing. I have to check out the schematics and Sega pinout details. Famicom would be better. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.brunofreitas.com/node/42">http://www.brunofreitas.com/node/42</a><!-- m -->

I don't know more. (I've never had reason to leave the Microchip world)<br /><br />The 2nd one is the same as the first, he just got a real PCB made instead of using a protoboard.

My skills are limited and I think I need someone who can explain it to me including complete schematics or very detailed descriptions.<br />First I have to know what controller is the best for this purpose and easy to handle and not too expensive. Depending on the hardware and programming language, I maybe also need someone to help me coding.<br />I did some other projects some time ago but don't have experience with all that. I don't want to ruin either controller or cartridges or PC.<br /><br />I need a more versatile dumper or have to read much more source codes. <br /><br />Any help what I should do is appreciated. Is there a better forum for that purpose? I wonder why only 2 guys in the world managed that. Hardware and games are also owned by a MESS member but nobody can read that (or want to ruin console and games). Maybe I have to contact Lira Nuna who wrote the first emulator. I wonder how he has dumped them.

You should be able to adapt any of them pretty easily.<br /><br />In general, a design that would work at 5V will still work at 3V, you'll just need to change what it's powered by.<br /><br /><br />In any case, I'm not interested in simply giving people solutions: I want them to learn to do it themselves. Dumping a ROM makes a good 2nd or 3rd microcontroller project, but you should get comfortable with digital stuff first.

Few own projects though.<br /><br />Yes I have to learn and study more. But first I have to know what microcontroller I should buy to not buy the wrong stuff and waste too much money.<br /><br />With a 3V Arduino how do I get data to a 5V PC? Don't know if there's conversion stuff embedded or if I have to pull up with electronics by myself. Then I don't need a microcontroller and can built a card reader like Brian.<br />People say he is a genius managing that.<br />I'm not sure if you could do that by reading what you told here. Just hooking it all up is obviously not enough. Sounds easy. But it's a system with few facts known. And too expensive to experiment without enough knowledge.<br />Even Brian doesn't know all of the Gameking as there are pins with functions he didn't understand at all even with an oscilloscope and his code.<br /><br />I think I will try it somehow and first buy a microcontroller. But I think I need someone to check if my schematics and code would work before I do the real thing.<br />As I told I better ask elsewhere. Why should I do that alone?<br /><br />There are different Gamekings and probably many people in China and elsewhere own one and maybe tried. And I don't think that Genesis, GBA and Gameking are that similar. Even a Gameboy has many different styles of cartridges. And who knows if a 4in1 Gameking cartridge needs bank switching or else.
