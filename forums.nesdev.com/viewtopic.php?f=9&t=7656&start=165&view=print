No other sprite has any similar guarantee though, it's just sprite 0.</div><br />I imagine that if you always use the topmost sprites (from 0 up) for IRQs and those don't appear on the same scanlines, it should OK (i.e. if you use sprite 1 for a second IRQ after sprite 0 has been fully rendered, both would happen at the same point in the scanline).</div>
<br />As long as (Y[1] &lt; Y[0] OR Y[1] &gt; Y[0]+7), Sprite 1's $FE IRQ will occur on PPU cycle 260.
<br />
<br />So basically, if you want multiple sprite-based $FE IRQs to occur closer than 8 scanlines together, you'd need to order the sprites from top down, in decreasing order. Keep the sprite limit in mind though, even if tile $FE is completely transparent, it still counts towards the scanline limit, so I doubt anyone would want to do this in something other than a tech demo.

<br />
<br />Now joking a side, maybe the title of the thread should be renamed since the project is dead by itself? Or just split this thread and make one about "what would be the best mapper" etc?
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />And instead of talking about mappers we should focus on making simpler game with less hardware so we can have some code base to work on more ambitious projects. I guess that was people in the past did indirectly anyway.

<br />Sunsoft mappers are the one we happened to be discussing in this topic. See <a href="http://nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&amp;threadid=51263" class="postlink">thread on NA</a>. I'd link the exact post, but I don't see "permanent link to this post" on NA's forum software. Follow the link and search for the text "No homebrew comes close to needing it".

<br />
<br />That's why I stay away from Nintendoage...
<br />
<br />Anyhoo, the core message is also stated on the NA thread: the reason home brew projects do not get completed has nothing to do with the mapper.
<br />
<br />Personally I could care less what mappers Bunnyboy can make. If (and it's a big if) I bring a game out on cartridge it won't be through him. Too many ethical issues there.
<br />
<br />That said I do find his development products to be top quality, and very useful.

<br />The products listed on <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/index.php?cPath=29&amp;osCsid=d14c7c78c1a7fb8ed25278d77c644466" class="postlink">this page</a> contain copyright material (or works based on copyright material) for which I assume bunnyboy has no license to resell. No where on his page does he claim that he does have a license, nor is Nintendo a fan of licensing their previous works, especially in the Mario franchise, to individuals.
<br />
<br />The above is a clear display of a lack of integrity, and that's not someone I want to do business with.
<br />
<br />Now again, with all of that said, I do enjoy his products and will continue to be a customer in the future, however I do not purchase those questionable products, nor do I want to enter into a business relationship with him.

It should actually be cheaper and easier than using donors if you know how to make the mapper.  Ordering up PCBs with or without components programming the roms/logic and selling somewhere like ebay wouldn't be to hard unless you don't want to deal with all the work involved.  
<br />
<br />The only real obstacle I see is the cart case I guess bunnyboy has someone making him his using injection molding?  I'm sure he'd be happy to sell a boat load of em to ya for a better rate though.  But there are other options out there but I doubt you'd be able to do much better on price.  Unless you went the unholy route of donor carts, but atleast you wouldn't need to mod the board.

<br />
<br />But a new board and CIC might be worth the $2 loss of profit per game, since doing a run of 200 or so carts would be insane to desolder the chips....
<br />
<br />I can't believe he asked if you were blabbering to be smart, that wasn't even anything technological. Just what the MMC3 does over the MMC1. Nothing trying to be smart there, that's just how tepples is, we all know that here. Apparently he doesn't, and that was just a jab at making tepples seem dumb to me.
<br />
<br />I also would like to know how to ask him about his boards and stuff when he is so hard to get contact with. I agree with the ethnics thing more-so now, too.
<br />
<br />And I know that small projects are hard to finish just themselves, but the complexity of a big game over a small game isn't even the game engine, but the mass ammount of content. Anyone who can even make a small game can make a full-fledged NES game to me. You just have to take more time with the content and not the engine. The engine is the easy part if anything.
