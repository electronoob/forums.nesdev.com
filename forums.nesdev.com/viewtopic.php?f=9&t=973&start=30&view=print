		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />EDIT: Scratch all of that. I got it to read my version, but it took a while. And it seems the cart has to be pushed down, being read, with nothing on the TV in order to be read by the software. It's rather annoying. But when I try and dump the cart, it unloades any exsisting plugin, then it initializes port, and tries and loads the plugin, but the operation times out. What is wrong here? Is the cart not inserted well enough? is there something wrong with my BIOS settings? I'm pretty sure I've tried it on both Biconditional and EPP. I know I've tried it on Biconditional, but I'm not sure about EPP. I'll go try EPP. That's what it's supposed to be set to correct?

<br />
<br />I deleted it, since it consisted entirely of "I've just edited the above message" , which has no purpose whatsoever - you could have just as easily included that in your original post.

Yeah, I could've just copied the text from the post being edited, deleted the old post, posted a new message, pasted the text from the old post into the new post, and wrote "EDIT: ...." on the bottom. If you don't know what I mean, don't bother trying to, because it doesn't matter, really.
<br />
<br />But did anybody experience these types of problems while using CopyNES? What are some reasons for a random almost-full-functioning CopyNES, as aposed to a not functioning system telling the software that it is CopyNES v.0? What connections on the copyNES board might be not well? AND! CopyNES only seems to return proper information about it's board while a game is in the system, pushed down, power on, and a gray screen. The thing is, I think data is still being read from the cart while it shows a gray screen. It's weird, and it randomly works, and I don't know why, and I'd appreciate a little advice <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />. Anybody have any?

<br />
<br />That sounds about right though.  The CopyNES BIOS wouldn't use the PPU because it would have to use every cart's CHR, which could be anything.
<br />
<br />I don't understand the randomly not working though.  Seems like it should always work, or never work.

<br />Not necessarily. I can think of some address line connections that would single-screen-mirror all nametables to one 1 KB bank of internal VRAM and all pattern tables to the other bank. Try running PPU A13 to CIRAM A10 and see what doesn't blow up. This would potentially give 64 tiles to work with, more than enough for uppercase ASCII. As for why Kevin Horton didn't think of doing this...

<br />
<br />It would've taken extra chips and things to do that, and then there was no guarantee it'd work with all carts.  Also, I had run out of I/O on the port chip, so I would've had to add some other things possibly.
<br />
<br />Though, personally, I don't know how useful being able to display stuff on the PPU would be anyways-  you can't display anything when you're dumping CHR, unless you want to dump it really, really slowly (during vlblank).  Also, the LCD was removed from the design for a similar reason to not using the PPU... the PC displays all of the needed status information and then some.  
<br />
<br />The LCD, while cool, was just absolutely worthless IMO.

Wait for sprite 0 to be deasserted, dump a bit, turn on the screen, wait for sprite 0 to be asserted, and then dump a bit more.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also, the LCD was removed from the design for a similar reason to not using the PPU... the PC displays all of the needed status information and then some.</div>
<br />Except for being able to display more information that would be useful in troubleshooting connection problems.
<br />
<br />Perhaps CopyNES version 2 could put some more logic on a CPLD. It seems to be working for the people selling PassMe adapters for Nintendo DS homebrew.
