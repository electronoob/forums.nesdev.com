<br />
<br />Rom addressing though, could be dealt with using unused address space.

That would be crazy though to have a SNES PowerPAK with a FPGA large enough to emulate the SGB allowing playback of GB roms on SNES.

The SNES PowerPak ships with a 15K, so obviously it's not happening but the smallest FPGA made today are 50K gate, the average are 500K and the largest are like 2M. Not only would such a FPGA be able to emulate the GB, but it also NES, Atari etc using the SNES' I/O. I think it would be cool (but a hell of a lot of work).

Maybe with instead of a CP flash card reader built in it could connect directly to usb. Maybe with 4MB of flash space to keep cost down. I'd pay extra for a second supplementary cartridge like that. Or, more simply, an FX board with a ZIF socked for eproms for us sloppy solderers.  Just some thoughts.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />SuperFX would be a hell of a lot easier than the Super Game Boy. Even with my SGB emulator, I had to exploit peeking at $2181-2182 to determine where the SGB BIOS was attempting to read from (it streams VRAM data from $7800 serially.) Of course, you can probably do that on real hardware, too.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure what to think about that. On one hand, it's really awesome to have such an all-in-one cart, but on the other hand, if you're emulating the SuperFX anyway, why not just use an emulator? To me the only real advantage of real hardware is getting perfect accuracy.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately a passthru cart won't work for the SFX and SA-1 since the program ROMs are behind the SFX chip. But for all the other special chips, you could create a T-connector. Preserve the perfect accuracy but allow custom data to be run.
<br />
<br />As for SGB, I'd say it's easier to just use a real SGB and a Game Boy flash cart. Those are much easier to obtain, and you gain the benefit of perfect accuracy instead of using another emulator.

<br />He was linking to a private forum. Hidden only so emu news sites don't update every single day about new WIP releases, which really just annoys everybody.
<br />
<br />Registration is just anti-spam, so far 100% effective. Serious question -- how's open registration working around these parts? It's pretty terrible at the Zboard right now. &lt;/offtopic&gt;
