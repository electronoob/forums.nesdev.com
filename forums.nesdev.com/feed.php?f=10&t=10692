It is the configuration for the system, but the cartridge one plugs into a NES can significantly change how the system acts.<br /><br />The cartridge can add extra RAM, or the ability to address more than 40960 bytes of data, or more complicated things. (This is why we have the notion of &quot;mappers&quot; in the iNES header.)<br /><br /><br />In addition, you may wish to change the mapping if you are using modules of code that need to be in different places, or aligned to specific things.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Fri Nov 15, 2013 2:05 pm</p><hr />

That thread seems to have a bunch of different config files in it. Which one should I use? Is there something wrong with the default one? Or is it normal to have a different config file for each project? If it is, that seems a little strange to me, as it seems like it should be a configuration for the target system (NES) rather than the code... isn't it?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5769">pinkpuff</a> — Fri Nov 15, 2013 1:39 pm</p><hr />
