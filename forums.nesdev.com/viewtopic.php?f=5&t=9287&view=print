I think there's room for alot more features in an Ice Climber game. I am quite surprised that there never were<br />another Ice Climber game btw..<br />&quot;The Goonies III&quot; would also be cool. I loved &quot;The Goonies II&quot;, so another Goonies-game with a remix of Cyndi Laupers hitmusic would be awesome! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not a proponent of sequels. If there was something good about a game it probably had mostly to do with the people making it and the environment/situation they were in to make it. Sometimes sequels do live up to, or improve upon the originals (e.g. Dark Souls, Mega Man 10, GTA2) but it seems like just as often they don't (Rastan 2, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, Sonic 4).<br /><br />You can't really copyright an element of gameplay, for the most part. It's easy to borrow gameplay ideas you thought you were good when designing a game. The hard part is implementing it well, and tuning/refining it into something that's fun to play.<br /><br />What I really think it comes down to is whether you get a good team and the right spark to make a good game. They'll probably put out something good whether or not it's a sequel. Maybe if a particular story involving particular characters is a huge part of a game (e.g. Metal Gear Solid) it really helps to keep the same characters/setting from game to game, but when the focus is on gameplay (and in the NES era, it usually is) a lot of the time you could could cosmetically replace characters and setting without fundamentally changing the game (see: Super Mario Bros. 2).<br /><br />If I had a list of NES games I wanted a sequel to, it would really just be a list of NES games I liked, but what I'm saying is, somebody who could make a good sequel to any of them would probably turn out a game that was just as good even if they didn't have a license to do that sequel.<br /><br /><br />Edit: Black Tiger could have worked pretty well on the NES, koitsu. I enjoyed that one in the arcade as a kid.

However, it says a version for the Commodore 64 was released; if decimal mode is not used you could possibly use a similar 6502 machine codes adjusted for NES/Famicom. Ask Capcom about it if you are interested.
