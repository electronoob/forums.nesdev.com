Sorry about the mixup! I meant Kirby's Adventure. I really enjoyed playing it because it didn't feel as limited as most NES games do, and I LOVED the fact that you could -save- your progress. Though I think a password option is really great for when something happens to your saved game. Besides that, I liked that it was easier. Lots of NES games are annoyingly difficult. However, I agree that I wanted more out of it <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />. Graphics were really lovely too.<br /><br />I actually had the courage to play through a hard copy of Dragon Warrior 1 on the actual NES! Yeah, it was a good thing to experience; I think most hardcore RPG lovers should definitely play through it just to see where we came from and how far we've come. It was somehow oddly enjoyable. The whole game was pretty much leveling up so you could buy the new equipment to level up some more, etc. But I still enjoyed playing the game somehow, despite the fact that it wasn't very good. I have not yet played Dragon Warrior 2, 3, or 4. I will load those onto the PowerPak as well. I have the Gameboy Color version of 1&amp;2, but I want the NES experience for now.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Jan 17, 2010 1:02 pm</p><hr />

Kirby's Adventure is great but really easy and short. I like it but definitely not one of my all time favs.<br /><br />Dragon Quest games are all compatible with the Power Pak, but for some reason I have trouble enjoying to play them on the NES. I enjoy the SNES/Playstation/GBC version a lot better. What I don't like is probably the SLOW walking hero, the SLOW battle and the INCREDIBLY HUGE amount of time you have to spend to level up if you want to survive even the first trial.<br />I think it went better for DQ4 tough, I finished Chapter 1 and it was pretty good but I was stuck in Chapter 2 in a cave I'd be killed in a matter of seconds and didn't want to spend one weekend leveling up.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Jan 17, 2010 2:14 am</p><hr />

Sorry, guys for being a little late on the response.<br /><br />I just wanted to say thanks a whole bunch guys for all the suggestions! A lot of the ones mentioned are ones that I have played before, and I agree with them being suggested. Some, however, I have yet to try. And funny enough, I forgot about the Megaman series! It just slipped my mind, but I'll definitely be putting them all on.<br /><br />I was surprised to see that nobody mentioned Kirby's Dreamland. That is probably one of the best NES games in my opinion. Was that maybe included in the "don't mention the obvious ones" category? I don't know. Anyways, I suppose I could just put pretty much every NES game on my PowerPak, and try them all myself. But I was just curious to know which ones would be recommended. I also don't know if I saw Dragon Warrior/Quest 1-4 mentioned. Is 4 compatible with the PowerPak? For some reason it rings a bell as being special somehow. Is that the one that's really huge?<br /><br />Anyways, thanks again guys! I'll be giving these games a try <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat Jan 16, 2010 10:15 pm</p><hr />

Trying to stay off super commonly named games for NES/famicom.<br /><br />Adventures of Lolo series. (Probably Commonly mentioned)<br /><br />Balloon Fight (Common, but I decided to mention it)<br /><br />Earthbound Zero/Mother<br /><br />Gimmick! (Mentioned already)<br /><br />I Love Softball (Impossible AI. But I actually have a lot of fun with it when I have someone to play with. It's actually a solid sports title, even if it's girly. I like it better than any of the other NES/famicom baseball games)<br /><br />MC Kids<br /><br />Panic Restaurant (Basic gameplay, but I enjoyed it. A nice soundtrack too)<br /><br />Plasma Ball (Just a NEAT game. Lots of japanese setup in the beginning, but once you get to the gameplay, it's cool. It's... kinda like dodgeball meets pong. Great graphics as well.)<br /><br />Quest of Ki (If you enjoy puzzle/platformers. This game is long.)<br /><br />Rad Racer (common, mentioning anyway)<br /><br />Solstice (Mentioned before.)<br /><br />Videomation (A paint program KINDA like Mario Paint. Neat to try at least once)<br /><br />Wario's Woods (Commonly mentioned? I dunno. A neat puzzle game.)<br /><br />I'd list some other random games that are fun to at least try like Videomation, but then the list would get really long. If you're interested in stuff like, "It's worth it to try Bad Dudes, just so you can laugh at its 'plot'.", let me know and I can try to think of other random interesting games worth at least trying.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Sat Jan 09, 2010 11:24 pm</p><hr />

I took it over to a friend's house and played today.  We were reminiscing earlier so I figured we should just play some.<br /><br />Twin Eagles is one of the many shooters on NES except that it is two player - though it is rather unremarkable.<br /><br />We played lots of two player games, Ivan Stewart's Super Offroad, Super Sprint, Nintendo World Cup Soccer, Ikari Warriors series, Smash TV, Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers, beat 'em ups like Ninja Turtles...shooters like the Contra series...<br /><br />One of my friends showed us a little bit of Solstice, which I had never tried, it's a cool little isometric puzzle/maze thing like The Immortal.<br /><br />Another thing we've been playing lately is Dr. Mario on Wii, so we tried the NES one and it is actually a bit tougher, feels faster.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3438">UncleSporky</a> — Sat Jan 09, 2010 8:25 pm</p><hr />

Some games I would recommend checking out. Splatterhouse (famicom) is a fun and nice looking platformer you should check out. It's simple but very enjoyable. Shadow of the Ninja is a platformer sometimes compared to Ninja Gaiden, it's fun but challenging. Ninja Gaiden the whole series ofcourse you could check out. Metal Storm is another excellent but tough platforming shooter to check out. Batman is another excellent game to check out platforming action, and Batman Returns is a beat em up sort of like TMNT 2. An awesome shoot em up game is Crisis Force (Konami VRC4) which I highly recommend. These are few a few I thought of that I don't think were mentioned yet.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Sat Jan 09, 2010 2:08 pm</p><hr />

Well when I got my powepack I was very exited - but when I figured it didn't work with my 16MB flashcard it break everyting. Now that I have another flashcard I still use much more emulators because most games adapt poorly on the PAL NES (even PAL ROMs) and there is a buzzing noise absent with most other games.<br />I got the Japanese version of Castlevania III working, with sound, but the graphics are glitched because of my PAL NES.<br /><br />When it comes to what good games I'd recommand I'd really say Megaman series, Contra series, Castlevania 1 and 3, Final Fantasy 1 and 3, Double Dragon 1 and 2, Battletoads, SMB 3 (you already know those I think).<br />About less popular "unknown gems", Batman - Return of the Joker is prety good, Solar Jetman, Solstice, and I think a decent english translation of Fire Emblem Gaiden was released recently.<br />Conquest of the Crystal Palace is great too (but might get terribly hard without savestates) if you like ancient China.<br />Power Blades is a cool game with great music.<br />Just Breed is IMO one of the best RPG for the system (second to FF3) but it uses the MMC5.<br />EDIT : Also I forgot to Mention Mighty Final Fight. It's a fun beat-em-up.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Jan 09, 2010 1:52 pm</p><hr />
