This is the main feature I'm missing so I can move from Nestopia into puNES, without this it's not possible to properly use RL bezels with puNES which is a major deal breaker for me.<br /><br />Other than this and apart for some specific mappers support the emulator is looking pretty damn accurate.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi!<br /><br />This is a fantastic emulator! Of all 176 NES emulators in my collection, Punes the one I like the most! Stable, recognize all my 6 joysticks without any conflict, very high accuracy, great sound, MMC5/VRC6-7/FME-7 extended audio chip compatible, support Famicom disk system, seamless/quick transition from windowed to full screen, no issue with my 3 LCD setup, etc! It also passes all the Bisqwit tests and all the Blargg tests, except &quot;power_up_palette&quot; from the PPU test: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://blargg.8bitalley.com/nes-tests/">http://blargg.8bitalley.com/nes-tests/</a><!-- m -->    <br /><br />The only demo I couldn't run properly so far is &quot;After Dark&quot;: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=15218">http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=15218</a><!-- m --> . Only VirtuaNES and Nintendulator runs it properly. Mapper 255 is also not supported it seems, but it's a minor issue as I believe this mapper is only used in multi games cartridge no one play, like the 115 in 1. Still, would be cool if it could be implemented! Also, I got a few ROM in .unf format instead of .nes and Punes can not load them. Could this be added, and if not, is there a utility to convert ROM from .unf to .nes?  <br /><br />The other thing I would like is to get sound from my back speakers on my 5.1 surround setup. As it is, I only hear sound from my 2 front speakers. My Realtek sound card support the &quot;speaker fill' option to shift some of the front sound of a stereo source to the back to create a fake surround effect, but it doesn't seem to work with Punes. I have noticed with other emulator that it could be due to the backend/API with either Xaudio, direct sound or OpenAL giving different results. As I remember, Xaudio usually provide the best experience. <br /><br />Thanks,<br />Ramon

This demo uses gfx control extensions written by xik for the MCK sound driver. CODE by xik, GFX by nullsleep and xik, MUSIC by nullsleep and xik. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">This demo was written to run on real hardware</span></strong>, it is not recommended for use with emulators, but if you must please use VirtuaNES. If you would like to run this on a real NES, use a mapper 0 cartridge ... LONG LIVE THE NES SCENE!&quot;<br /><br />From that, I can only assume the demo actually run correctly on real hardware. It's either that, or the author is lying. Strange! It would also mean both VirtuaNES and Nintendulator purposely implemented a weird hack to accommodate/run correctly a specific broken demo that presumably would not run properly on real hardware. That would be very strange too! Not only strange, but a first as I don't recall any other emulator taking into account broken software that would not even run on real hardware into their development/coding efforts. <br /><br />Thanks for replying to my post,<br />Ramon

It doens't mean that these emulators have a hack to accomodate this demo; there are a number of things (especially memory initialization) that are not consistent from NES to NES, so being undefined, emulators have taken different approaches to what's a sensible &quot;default&quot;. This demo merely takes advantage of that arbitrary choice made in particular emulators.<br /><br />This is not the only demo that claims it runs on hardware even though it doesn't. The <a href="http://nesdev.com/rtc-y2k.zip" class="postlink">RTC Y2K demo</a> made a similar false claim.
