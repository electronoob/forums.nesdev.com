It changes immediately on writes to $4101; no need to write to any other register.<br /><br />Down side: Pin 22 on my IC emits a variety of different high frequency signals.<br /><br />My initial test consisted of four &quot;old&quot; LEDs, connected in series, from +5V to ground. None light. I then connect the middle leg (two LEDs both above and below) to the pin and ... somehow all four LEDs light up in different brightnesses.<br /><br />Well, that's odd. Oscilloscope time!<br /><br />... That's worse. Pin 22 is some logical function of other pins, depending on what value was latched to $w4101/pin12. I spent some time comparing it to other pins and it wasn't obviously the same as anything else. It is more-or-less synchronous, however.<br /><br />... I tentatively think, that when the value written to pin 12 is 0, the resulting signal is pin 6 OR pin 8.<br />... and that when the value latched is 1, the resulting signal is just pin 8?<br /><br />Using wire wrap, I'd connected CPU D0-D2,D6 to pins 6, 8, 9, 10 as I specified in the pinout—the code in Policeman doesn't care.<br /><br />Pins 8 and 9 (what I've connected to D1 and D2) is definitely unequivocally latched via $4102 and can be read back immediately. Pin 6 isn't latched on writes to $4102—instead it seems that 0 is always latched, but the value read back is inverted according to the invert bit in $4101. (In other words, pin 6 reads back the inverted value latched into pin 12)<br /><br />... and I realize now that I completely forgot to play around with what writes to $4103 did, if anything, to any of the above.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Test 2: Swap the connections of Pins 4 and 5 from GND/Vcc to Vcc/GND and see if the way the LED change is now reversed. (I'm not sure if this can be done with wire-wrap?)<br /></div>That definitely requires desoldering.<br /><br />Also, just in case anyone else is tempted: DON'T do this before making sure that pins 4 and 5 are not internally connected to pins 7 and 19. If you connect 5V across the bond wires and a silicon trace inside that'll assuredly blow something up.
