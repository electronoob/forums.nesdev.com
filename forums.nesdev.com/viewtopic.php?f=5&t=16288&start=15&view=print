It's really terrible, but it did happen quite a bit, I think mostly in the earlier years of DVD.

I have many a time come across the situation where somebody was upgrading an old 16:9 CRT for a shiny new LCD (or plasma a few years ago), only to find that their DVD player had been set to 4:3LB, or even worse, had never been through the initial setup even though it had obviously been heavily used.  At least now all the decent brand players come set to 16:9 and RGB by default.<br /><br />I'm glad that some TV stations are broadcasting their old 4:3 content pillar-boxed.  It's a loosing battle convincing the masses that OAR is the way to go.<br /><br />More and more I have come to the conclusion that most people, when you really boil it down, just don't care about getting the best out of their equipment, or at least don't bother to explore its capabilities...   For somebody like me it can be soul destroying.<br /><br />Not that I'm meaning to point any fingers at anybody here...  It's just an observation from when I'm on the job.
