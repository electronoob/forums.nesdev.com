A custom mapper that uses data latches to allow writing to VRAM through CPU$5000-$5FFF to simulate GBA style dual-ported VRAM might be useful for this.

<br />me and some friends did a little gba demo for like a year ago using that technique. I thought it was rather common to use it on the gba, is it?

You know, here is basically the NES dev thread, and I think it's interesting to compare the NES with different hardware. But why are everyone speaking about the GBA ? I've nothing against the GBA (exept that a blue line of pixels constantly appears vertically on the middle of the screen on mine, and it appeared just after the warranty has been expired, this is pretty much terrible), but I know absolutely nothing about GBA dev, and <strong>everyone</strong> speaks about the GBA as if GBA dev would be very comon to everyone.

And everyone's just like, "oh yeah, that's how you do this on gba blah blah blah blah blah". And I'm just saying that this is NESdev, and not GBAdev, so don't speak of it here! No, memblers should probably create a GBAdev forum, and we'll all be happy. I don't know what I'm talking about, so I'm going to stop.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not reffering to any particular post, but it's by far not the fist time this happens. I'm not particulary scared, but rather confused. Many times I saw blah blah balh, just like the GBA when blah blah blah. Some people may be used to gba dev, but not everyone in there. If you want speak about gba dev, just go on <a href="http://www.gbadev.org" class="postlink">http://www.gbadev.org</a> which is the equivelent to this site for the gba.
<br />I'm not against to compare how thing works on a console or like on another, but I'm against something like "Just do like we do on the gba" like if it was common and understandible for everyone. I think if you go on gbadev's forum and, for example, ask a question about graphics, and say "yeah, it's just like doing sprites with $4014 on the NES", I'm pretty sure that not everyone there will understand, but if you say "the NES also have a similar DMA feature for the sprites, I think it's better than....." it would be better.
<br />Overall, the particular post above isn't much scaring, even if it is not as addictive that it would be supposed to be, but I remember some other thread on the hardware section that would put 3.3 V flash chips "like the GBA", or doing another thing "like the GBA" that I have even no idea what it is. That's rather scaring.
<br />
<br />Another confusing thing is that, on the other thread, a discussion about the SNES seems to be prohibed, even if the SNES is a lot closer to the NES than the GBA, but everyone is always talking gba in there. That's just it. Okay, tepples is a guy comon in gbadev and nesdev, but is that enough ?

Oh my gosh. I'm more impressed at this than Cosmic Epsilon. This gives you more 3D than Mario Kart on SNES. There's a concept of hills! You round corners and whatnot. You can go up/downhill. Go download the ROM, you'll be impressed.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />since we're back at this, there is one game that got my attention immediatly: Bucky O'Hare.
<br />
<br />It is not impressive in a "distortion" or "3D" kinda way, wich is what usually gets more attention. The game is a platformer, (my favorite kind of game!) and applies a lot of little effects to make the NES look less lame when compared to the 16-bit consoles of the time.
<br />
<br />The ice level has a nice layer of water that moves, and what's below it has a darker tone, simulating dark water. And if that's not enough, there are some sprites (frozen chunks?) floating by to increase the effect of transparency.
<br />
<br />The game does a lot of parallax scrolling and simulates layers by animating background tiles. It combines parallax with sprites so you think huge moving objects can overlap. It has some huge background animations, that you don't usually see on the NES, as it is so slow to update the BG.
<br />
<br />I can't even remember half of the cool stuff present in that game. Just run the game and don't even play, watch the demos first. I was amazed. That game is a serious competition to 16 bit games.
<br />
<br />And it is not only pretty to look at. As a platformer fan I found that very amusing too. Each level has a unique gameplay, the bosses (the ones I saw) are nice too. You can change characters during the level, characters who have different abilities.
<br />
<br />It easily bacame one of my favorite NES games.

<br />
<br />I guess I'd be a little frustrated if playing it without the aid of savestates. Still seems to be a really cool game, though. There are some good walkthroughs for it at gamefaqs.com.
