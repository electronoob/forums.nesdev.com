<br />
<br />That is Milt&amp;Bradley... I would SERIOUSLY check to see if they patented the gameplay motif. MB is a bunch of notorious ass-fucks about that.
<br />
<br />However, I wasn't meaning something with that level of complexity for the travel kit.  More like what you get in a travel Tarot set;  A deck of cards, and a folded cloth square with "areas" defined on it.  Not intended for play IN a vehicle, but intended for use in the motel. (or when the power goes out.)
<br />
<br />For the NES cart boxes--  I think the design of the cart itself was intended to show the edge of the label on the shelf, (package built into design of product)-- and that the "Spiffy Box" was meant to be the cart housing itself.  An additional perk might be to include a felt edge connect protector "tampon", (Fits into the card edge undercut, protects the card edge from getting dirty/dusty/oxide coated, and sticks out a bit with a hard plastic end to prevent it from falling apart from multiple insertions and to allow easy removal. Perhaps I should design one at work today.)
<br />
<br />Most of the problem with NES carts was that the labels were just colored glossy paper, which gets eroded over time, and the cart ends up looking like it has leprosy.  Making the cart design a little different by insetting the label area 1.5mm, and then shimming the space with clear plastic, or clear epoxy would protect the labels, and make the cartridge art much more durable.

<br />Unlike copyrights, patents expire. Any game mechanic used in a board, card, or video game published prior to 1990 is unpatented by now. Memory(tm) products like <a href="http://myatomic.com/catalog/viewsku?sku=MLB4664&amp;itemname=original_memory_game" class="postlink">original Memory game</a> have been around <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/7688/memory" class="postlink">since 1959 according to BGG</a>, and Wikipedia has an article about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_%28game_show%29" class="postlink">a game show with a similar play mechanic</a> whose U.S. TV run started in 1958.
<br />
<br />I wonder what it costs to get such <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feelie" class="postlink">feelies</a> manufactured.

<br />
<br />While most of the items they make are not really applicable to a videogame feelie, they DO offer "paperback book printing" (Manuals!), and poster print services.
