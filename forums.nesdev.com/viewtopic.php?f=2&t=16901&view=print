Something like a tutorial which indicates step by step how to just change 1 tile on the PPU?<br /><br />What I'm trying to say is that I would be looking for something more basic.

(Unless your whole game has only one tile?) RAM does not start up with any contents already in it. So... tepples' article is a thing you will need to learn first, before you can get to modifying a single tile.<br /><br />If you're using CHR-ROM you can't change just one tile. That can only be banked in pages (or sometimes not at all), depending on the mapper used. The more advanced mappers can page them in 1k (64 tile) sets.

The game may very well have been &quot;tuned&quot; to use all of the vblank time (which is the only time you're allowed to write to VRAM if rendering is on) under certain conditions, and if you try to put the extra 140 to 200 cycles that updating 16 bytes takes, you might extrapolate the allowed time for updates an end up with corrupted graphics/scroll, even though the copy procedure by itself is correct.<br /><br />To hack a game you need more than just the knowledge of how to perform a certain task, you need to know how that task and the time it takes will affect the existing game engine, in order to avoid any conflicts and timing issues.

I'm pretty sure I know some function which will check that and I will be able to use this<br /><br />I'm glad you mentionned it I forgot about this.
