<br />
<br /><strong>Im stuck in Blarrg's test NMI Suppression. It throws me error #3 "Reading flag when it's set should suppress NMI".</strong>
<br />
<br />I ask your help to someone explain me what's is going on since i can't fix the error. Maybe a short explanation of what happens?
<br />
<br />Thanks in advance.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok thanks for the answer i got it.
<br />The thing is i cannot implement it in my framework.
<br />
<br />Im using C and i use pointer to functions when $2002 is read.
<br />
<br />Then i here is my vblank code:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />while &#40; Ppu.scanline &gt;= 241 &amp;&amp; Ppu.scanline &lt;= 260 &#41; <br />&#123; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;while&#40; Ppu.scanline_cycle &lt; 341&#41; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&#123; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;if &#40;Ppu.nmi_onvblank &amp;&amp; Ppu.on_vblank&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SetNmiPending&#40;&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#125;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ppu.scanline_cycle++; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ppu.ppu_timestamp += NTSC_INC; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;if&#40; Ppu.ppu_timestamp &gt;= runto&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;return; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&#125;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Ppu.scanline_cycle = 0; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Ppu.scanline++; <br />&nbsp; &#125; <br /></div>
<br />
<br />The main function is RunPpu(int run_to) that runs the ppu cycles given certain cycles (cpu cycles).
<br />
<br />Where NTSC_INC is equal to "1".
<br />
<br />I don't figure out how to implment it.

<br />No RunPpu() i emulate per instrucction cycle * 3, im not taking pal into account right now.
<br />
<br />Forgive me to bother you: is it possible that you pass me a little info about realtime (as you call it) emulation?
<br />That would be very helpfully for me. If you don't want to it's fine, no problem, maybe i will post a thread "a method about emulating".
<br />
<br />Zepper it gave me and idea and i will try to figure out how to emulate in realtime. I really don't want the faster and/or the best emulator possible, i just want my emulator be accurate by now. 
<br />Anyway thank you for all.
<br />
<br />Edit: maybe emulating opcodes cycles per cycles could help?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you're only emulating three PPU cycles at once, that's "real time".
<br />
<br />A "timestamp" system means you run the CPU for 100-some cycles, keeping track of what it writes to PPU ports and when. Then you run the PPU for one scanline, executing the writes as if they had happened on the time that the CPU marked for each write.
<br />
<br />What you need to do is distinguish writes that happen on the first, second, or third PPU cycle of a given CPU cycle. Only one of those cycles causes a missed NMI.
<br />
<br />Emulating one instruction at a time is OK as long as the write happens on the last CPU cycle of the instruction.
<br />
<br />PAL is conceptually easy the way you're doing it: emulate 3, 3, 3, 3, 4 instead of 3, 3, 3, 3, 3.

<br />I have per instruction CPU emulation, is it valid to put a RunPpu() (wich will run 3 ppu cycles) inside of the instructions? Of course always respecting what each one does in each cycle.
<br />I mean stopping cpu and inside the instruction run 3 ppu cycles.
<br />Maybe could be a solution for not re-writing a per cycle emulation CPU core.
<br />But there will be to much function call overhead.
<br />
<br />What is convinient to make a new CPU core per cycle or executing PPU inside instructions?
<br />
<br />Taking into account i want to change to "real time".
