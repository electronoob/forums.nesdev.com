Celius : Actually yeah, I've just totally forgot about maps and stuff because I've been a lot of trouble with AI and physics lataly, and those are much more annoying than anything else, as opposed to create maps and mazing routines wich is a quite fun thing. I think phisics really are annoying, but I'm feeling good after most of it is being done.<br /><br />Actually do a NES ROM map editor can proof to be quite fun, to run an editor to run on the same platform as the game. Also, you just need to know 6502 coding. However, making a windows editor would make more sense, because you can modify it easier to get maps from a different format for another game or something...<br />And with RAW compression, doing all maps with .db isn't really that much a pain. I just have the low 5 bits tell the metatiles number, and the high 3 bits tell the number of times it repeats, so it is fairly easy to code and it has a great compression ratio.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Jul 14, 2006 11:56 pm</p><hr />

I make NES ROM level editors that save their data in SRAM, then I copy and paste data from the SAV file into a new binary file, and just incbin that. It's actually quite handy, because I can just use the knowledge I already have to make things easier.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Fri Jul 14, 2006 6:35 pm</p><hr />

If I made a new engine, there would definitely be things I'd fix, but I think that what I've done is pretty impressive for being my first sidescroller. I'm getting there, I'm over halfway done making my engine.

If anyone's interested, I've been working on an NROM sidescroller, and I'm planning to re-use the engine for the sequels to it. This is what I have left to do:<br /><br />1. Create a sound engine<br /><br />2. Finish the AI part of it<br /><br />3. Create physics- Includes collision, jumping, and whatnot.<br /><br />4. Successfully make code that will go to the next level of the game<br /><br />5. Make password access<br /><br /><br />Some bad things about my engine:<br /><br />1. Can't go back in the level<br /><br />2. Only 4 enemies may be on the screen at once.<br /><br />3. Enemies cannot go beyond the right side border of the screen once they have crossed it.<br /><br />4. Pretty much only $540-$5FF and $700-$7FF are available, because the rest is used for the engine.<br /><br />5. The game uses objects, and these objects use more space than metatiles they contain.<br /><br />A couple good things:<br /><br />1. Levels are 256 bytes long (not including the sprite part), so it allows for many levels.<br /><br />2. Each enemy has $40 bytes reserved for it's AI commands (Does that make sense?)<br /><br />3. Space isn't really an issue here.<br /><br />How does this sound? It's my first NROM sidescroller attempt, so I think it's pretty decent. I haven't finished it yet, but this is what it will be like.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Fri Jul 14, 2006 1:18 pm</p><hr />

I'll offer my input also.<br /><br />1. What Bregalad said.  The artist understanding the PPU as well as the programmer does would be ideal.<br /><br />2. If the game is anything beyond simple, writing development tools would be smart.  Something like a level editor would be almost necessary.<br /><br />3. Certainly.  Highly determined people.<br /><br />4. It's likely to be a lot of work, at any price I'm sure it would come out to be waay below 'minimum wage' anyways.  Definitely in hobbyist territory here. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I would think some kind of profit (and copyright)-sharing would be a reasonable to see it.  50% (or more, easily) would be a start.  Depends on what really carries the project, I suppose.<br /><br />5. I'd estimate between 6 months to 1.5 years.  Or forever, if the scope of the game changes enough during development.<br /><br />I could probably help out with some hardware (loan a devcart or something), since developing with emulators only is a total crapshoot.  That offer is for anyone, too.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Jul 14, 2006 5:17 am</p><hr />

1 - No, artists don't have to know a lot about programming. Just know about how the PPU works, and know the hardware limitation with tiles and color. If you're in a team, artists and programmers should work together to got a great results but the artists doesn't have to know programming, they should just be supported by a programmer that can tell them if what they want to do is possible or not on the hardware.<br />2 - Yes, you have to write all the game engine in 6502 assembly. Once you have made a whole game, it would be easier to do others as you could reuse your own routines. There isn't anything yet worth using in the NESdev scene.<br />3 - Of course it is, as long as you made it seriously<br />4 - We're all homebrew devlopment crews. No money is involved, exept maybe to purchase hardware things to test your code or whatever.<br />5 - This all depend how much people are involved, how much they are experimented/skilled and how much time they spend on it regulary.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Jul 11, 2006 1:04 am</p><hr />

My name is kurt and i play in a band called the depreciation guild.  I have no experience with programming but i create NES music which is used for our group.  We're currently looking to make a sidescroller game that features the 2 members of the band, for possible cartridge release on the NES or as a ROM for emulator use.  We know that this is an ambitious project but we're pretty serious about it and want to make it happen.  I'm wondering how possible it will be to do this, given the constraints of modern hardware.  Also, I have a few questions:<br /><br />1.) We could handle the sound aspect of the game and we have plenty of friends who are artists, but would we need an artist who knows how to program in 6502 assembler code (if that's what it's called), to make the game art?<br /><br />2.) Would creating a game involve writing 100% original code or are there development tools available for writing, let's say, a sidescroller game?<br /><br />3.) Is it possible to even create a game with a team of only a few people?<br /><br />4.) Obviously, there would be $$$ involved for helping us undertake this project.  What would be a reasonable pay for the writing of the game code? <br /><br />5.) What is a reasonable time frame for a game to be created in?<br /><br />Email me at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:gibson781@gmail.com">gibson781@gmail.com</a><!-- e --> if you're interested.
