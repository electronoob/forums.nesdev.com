I don't know if they talk about Japanese sets yet.<br /><br />I have been searching for a converter that could have done rf to hdmi so I could have used one of my famiom near my computer but it seems quite uncommon actually in Japan or I do not search with appropriate words in Japanese. <br /><br />For connecting to my tv set, I could try the composite mod since I have a few junk famicom lying around but the converter would have saved time and allow to use on a PC monitor, which is a plus (the rest of the family don't really &quot;share&quot; much the tv <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />)<br /><br />How hard is the composite mod to do for someone that knows how to solder but is have very little knowledge about electronics?

I may have said that it was some junk famicom but what I meant is that I found them in the junk section, which in Japan means &quot;things we didn't even bother to test&quot; <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />. They seems to be working well it just that cutting trace and maybe breaking things along the way scare me a little bit ^^;;<br /><br />The diagram with the pin seems to be about the video so I guess there must be something else to be done for the audio. I will continue to read the thread on the subject.

Everybody seems to report different amounts of jailbars, but I was maybe lucky that they weren't significant for me.<br /><br />The audio signal just comes straight from the audio return pin on the cartridge connector. Only a wire is needed. (I think some people use a small capacitor in line here, though.)<br /><br /><br />As for the jailbars, I wouldn't pay any attention to all the weird suggestions people have for that <em>unless</em> you first do the simple mod and determine that it's a problem for you. A lot of the things people suggest for that seem really complicated (desoldering PPU, etc.) or dubious/superstitious.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Given Kyuusaku's original schematic, I think you could even just leave the original 2SA937 in place (because it's the same type of transistor and hooked up the same way), and just remove R12. Then add the two new resistors and capacitor.<br /><br />If you want an even less visible modification, you might be able to bypass the RF modulator altogether and repurpose the RF output jack to emit baseband video instead. Still need a place for the baseband audio output jack, though.

Internally, the same 5V are used for both.<br /><br />A major source of noise is this variation on the 5V line; especially for the 2C02 which has no feedback (and so no power supply &quot;rejection&quot;) internally. The video stage is nothing more than a long chain of resistors, and a multiplexer to choose between one of the those voltages.<br /><br />Adding the capacitors makes the 5V supply &quot;firmer&quot;, so that it changes voltage less in response to other devices needing more or less power. This, in turn, means less noise should be visible inside the video output.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And other site which modify the famicom for hdmi instead (maybe this is something already known, I'm quite late in nes news these days)<br /></div>That's kevtris's project.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh, that's why it looked familiar but didn't know why. Thank you for clarifying that part and the caps one. I always enjoy reading the explanations even though my knowledge is limited on the subject but I'm always grateful about such information.<br /><br />So the site was nothing new after all. I was just getting exited for nothing but it was fun while it lasted <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> As for the Kevtris mod, that is something I would have loved to add to one unit since it could be connected later to a pc monitor and with the limited space in Japan, that would have been very useful. But.... After seeing the images on how it was installed... I don't think I can do that. <br /><br />My old monitor for some odd reason support components cables (not the japanese d-terminal type, the RCA based one) so maybe figuring out a way to convert the signal that way would make more sense even though the quality was not so great when I tried a PS2 long time ago. I will check if there is information about that on the web.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The two japanese sites linked seem to advocate very similar solutions.<br /><br />1.  A large, 330uF capacitor on the power rail.  The sites differ on whether solid polymer or standard electrolytic is best.  <br /><br />2.  Replace .1uF capacitors with 1.5uF capacitors (GPM revisions) or add 2.2uF capacitors (HVC revisions), multilayer ceramic.<br /><br />3.  Cut Pin 21 or eliminate the trace to the base pin on the video amplifier transistor or remove the video signal wire from the board<br /><br />4.  Add a 1nF capacitor across the video and ground lines (optional).  <br /><br />I have read that it is best to add a 220uF capacitor at the audio output pin, to eliminate DC offset perhaps.
