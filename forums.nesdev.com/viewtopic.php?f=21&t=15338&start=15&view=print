		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The ones I don't know first:<br /><br />Cosmic Epsilon, 3D world-runner, Tetrastar: not familiar with how they did it, though obviously all non-floor/gap objects are sprites in 3D world-runner.<br />Days of Thunder: Also unsure. Looks like the clouds are sprites, and I suspect the diagonal track is partly to have sprites on different lines, but I have no clue.<br />Castelian: one I want to know, since there was a TAS lately for it.<br />============<br />I'll add my best-guesses/observations for the rest.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Plain old horizontal scroll changes, it seems. (Bucky O'hare, red planet: 10:28 ) </div><br />-plus the horizontal-lines between platforms and the parallax background, and the horizontal lines above the parallax layers…tricking your eyes into adding their own scroll values for these, despite them being static.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">only the part with spikes has to be redrawn, so the updates are actually quite small.</div>It's still an 4-tall chunk of tiles each to draw (piston-or-blank, rivet, spike, spike). One thing is, the pistons don't all update on the same frame.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The name tables are blanked and little squares showing parts of the background are moved in software, </div> Attribute tables paletting things to black (or not) would make more sense to me, but not sure. It's a lot fewer updates per-frame to diddle AT…and, if I see correctly, each lighting-up shot carefully stays within one attribute-table byte's 32-px band. The level geometry then makes all platforms also align to 32px, making the shots remain threatening.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The huge beams are drawn on the background.</div>They don't even do the Quickman (Megaman 2) trick of having a sprite at the head of the beam to make it come out smoothly, but it's going much faster, anyway.<br /><br />Of the gallery…a lot of them are just a buncha raster scroll splits, whether parallax or sinusoidal.<br />Metal Storm, Thunder Warrior: banking the central chasm (or other distant BG) to &quot;slow down&quot; its scrolling, getting apparent vertical parallax.<br />Crisis Force, Sword Master: combine above bank-slow with parallax scroll<br />Dizzy: change vertical scroll each scanline, invert scroll/compress (with per-line scrollchange) for the &quot;Rolled&quot; segment…and, since it looks a bit narrow, is using a thick bunch of sprites to obscure the glitches around HBlank, probably.<br />Boku Dracula-Kun: we've had a topic on this. Tower and (some) stars are sprites, so the moon/alien are parallaxed.<br /><br />Battletoads (level 2: Wookie Hole): rewrite the tiles at the edges to slow their scroll; also note very little variation in the level BG. The color choices are handy for trcking your eyes into adding more parallax depth than exists.<br />Kirby's Adventure Butter Building Tower: banked tiles to look like it's spinning. The illusion doesn't look quite right on the bit where they <a href="http://youtu.be/rthibR0gVFU#t=11m" class="postlink">draw three towers.</a><br />Micro Machines: the two-color distant-BG tile layer here, being 8x8 alternating squares, is very cheap to rewrite the pattern for each frame (Micro Machines uses CHR-RAM), as one will be able to write the same bytes multiple times.<br />Monster in my Pocket: the edges of the TV are narrow enough to be sprites, and behind the face notably shares a palette with outside it.<br />Rescue - the Embassy Mission: blue and brown palettes only have 3 colors, so one duplicates BG-black so it can occlude the 8x8 sprites beng moved behind it. Note that the window is only 7 tiles wide-this makes for a 1-tile(/sprite) scrollseam allowed.<br />Secret Ties: parallax+sprite to mix layers<br />Street Heroes: unconventional choiec of BG color as red, use of priority.<br />Summer Carnival '92 RECCA: scroll splits, scroll splits, sprite flicker, and more scroll splits. OH, hey, there's that laser effect that Minus Infinity lifted. Some manner of spritework.<br />Why is Taboo on there? That's just changing palette table and plain scrolling, not even having to rewrite NTs.<br />Final Lap: like Rad Racer, I bet: a lot of scroll splits and a surprisingly-static NT.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> impossible to use ram for the graphics </div> nah, you can have bankswapped CHR-RAM. Only a few programs did it (inc. <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?vram_op=%3E%60%40%60&amp;vram=8&amp;order=asc&amp;rfa=2+18+10+9" class="postlink">Videomation, RacerMate Challenge II, and Oeka Kids</a>), but it's possible and been done.

It's just got a lot of tiles dedicated to the track, occupying 3k of the CHR space constantly, paging pieces in 1k blocks. Probably some technical animator spent a lot of time working out a sequence of which 1k blocks you'll need, frame by frame? There are a lot of rough edges though, maybe it's some sort of heuristic best-fit situation? The tracks are deterministic, of course, you can only go forward, so the exact sequence of images needed can be determined in advance.<br /><br />The clouds are sprites, yes. Interestingly, there are also behind-the-background masking sprites at the left and right edges of the field to hide the edges of sprites as they scroll into view.
