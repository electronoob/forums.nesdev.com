SSH is open to the world by default, but any time we see brute force attempts from anywhere, we start firewalling off network blocks.<br /><br />What I was saying was that APNIC (Asia) just managed to get their hands on a very large network block from ARIN -- specifically 1.0.0.0/8 -- so I expect to start seeing more brute force SSH attempts from IPs within that block.<br /><br />If SSH access doesn't work for you at present (from home or work), the easiest way for me to debug it is to talk to me in real-time.  I'm available on MSN/Live, AIM, Yahoo, and ICQ (MSN/Live preferred).  All my contact methods are in my profile here on the forum -- add me and we can work in real-time to find out what the IP address or network block is which I need to permit/add an exclusion for.  :-)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Fri Jan 29, 2010 7:39 am</p><hr />
