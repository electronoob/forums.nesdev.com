A 16x32 pixel sprite like Donny or the zombie is two strips of two sprites, plus extra strips for the extra color layer. The separate engine used for cut scenes uses a similar technique with 8x8 sprites.

I have ground decorations drawn (bushes, fences, flowers, etc) but not implemented yet. I think they'll have to be manually placed if I want them to look nice at all, haha.<br /><br />I thought about some more complicated metasprite formats but I ended up just going with this for now since it was easy to code and worked well for the enemies I have drawn:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;ppww whhh<br />&nbsp;|||| |+++- height in tiles<br />&nbsp;||++-+---- width in tiles<br />&nbsp;++-------- palette<br /><br />&#91;yxet tttt&#93; (repeated)<br />&nbsp;|||+-++++- tile number (0-31)<br />&nbsp;||+------- empty, skip this tile and don't use up an OAM slot<br />&nbsp;|+-------- X flip<br />&nbsp;+--------- Y flip<br /></div><br />Tiles are listed in columns, so that partially offscreen sprites can simply adjust their width and starting index.<br />In the header, width can be ANDed directly to get the width in pixels, though I'm not taking advantage of that. I also positioned the X and Y flip so that they could be ORed directly into the palette used for the sprite to get the attributes. A lot of my metasprites use flipping to conserve tiles.

I was thinking of having some animation.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HOMjKIl.gif" alt="Image" /><br />Enemy interaction with projectiles is now in, which means you can now stun, attack and actually copy enemy abilities now, though there's only one copyable enemy in the intro level.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;222<br />111222&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6666<br />11122233333334&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6666<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \_5_/</div><br />I've been working on level compression more. I added a new command that creates a series of rectangles sharing the same starting height. I have the details documented for this and the rest of the compression commands <a href="https://github.com/NovaSquirrel/NovaTheSquirrel/blob/master/docs/level%20decompression.txt" class="postlink">in the repository</a>. I think it can cut the bytes used for level terrain down to a third?<br /><br />Somehow my sprite/background collision is still awful and I'm probably just going to have to do a complete rewrite or something and figure this out. That'll probably be where I go next when I get back to working on this. It's somehow possible to get stuck in blocks forever and that's really not good.<br /><br />EDIT: OH I almost forgot, I also did a lot of work on getting levels with non-horizontal shapes working. There can be scrolling barriers between screens and screens can specify that they're linking to another screen on the top and bottom sides. With this, you can fake that the level is taller than it really is.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Collision should now be fully fixed. There was a bug involving the fact that the player is 24 pixels tall, and it was snapping to a block in the ground as if the player had landed on it, dragging them into the ground.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/O4iOEfu.png" alt="Image" /><br />I added an inventory screen (accessed via Start), using a variable-width font like the rest of the game. Because of how little space this takes, I have a fancy background around the menu that looks like FHBG's backgrounds. Right now you can use items and swap their positions with Select, though using an item doesn't delete it or anything yet.<br /><br />I also added dying. Right now it plays a DPCM sample of CDi Ganon saying &quot;die&quot; which I'll probably replace with an imitation of it that I can freely use. I'll also move it away from being DPCM so it's not eating up fixed bank space. My puzzle-style stages will have a clip of someone saying &quot;bummer&quot; instead.<br /><br />I've been working on the scripting system a lot though I haven't gotten the cutscene engine to the point where it can actually run scripts. From here I'll probably keep working on the cutscene engine and maybe get that working so I can make signs readable.

I went back to a $31 background for now and I wanna change how the ground looks.<br />In DABG I had a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/lHBj6GT.png" class="postlink">brown</a> ground with black dots in it for texture. I don't think I could make a good texture for these colors with green as the only other palette colors.<br /><br />But, in this game, I'm going for more a stylized art style with colored outlines, and I went with pink originally because it was the closest I could find to <a href="http://www.nintendocity.com/screenshots/snes_screenshots/thesnesscreenshots/smw_screenshots/smw098.png" class="postlink">Super Mario  World's</a> cream colored ground in the NES palette. This pink looks pretty bad on my TV and most places that aren't FCEUX's palette.<br /><br />I did a <a href="http://imgur.com/a/CcWAq" class="postlink">bunch of screenshots</a> with differently colored grounds with <a href="http://www.firebrandx.com/nespalette.html" class="postlink">Firebrandx's palette</a> and most of the people I showed it to favored <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zb7q4bF.png" class="postlink">#3</a> while I think it's too bright. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/QHCrKsZ.png" class="postlink">Orange</a> looked good to me (though I already have an orange palette, which would look too similar) while <a href="http://i.imgur.com/qTg0TVD.png" class="postlink">brown</a> seems like it'd only be okay if I removed the ground texture, but even then there's little contrast with the outline.<br /><br />Since my game's supposed to take place in a virtual world and there's little reason to try to make everything realistic, I played with some more creative colors to see how they looked and I actually really like how <a href="http://i.imgur.com/rcj8EKI.png" class="postlink">fully green</a> ground looks, which looks somewhat <a href="https://brokeassretro.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/36106-kirby-s-adventure-nes-screenshot-floating-past-some-enemiess.jpg" class="postlink">like</a> <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/56/NES_Kirbys_Adventure.png" class="postlink">Kirby's</a> <a href="http://www.jibbajaba.com/NESleague/images/kirby2.png" class="postlink">Adventure</a>. My game is mostly monochrome and bright and cartoony like Kirby is, so I feel like the same kinda aesthetics could work.<br /><br />So yeah, anyone that actually know what they're doing graphics-wise have any suggestions?

I'm playing around with actually seeing what my tiles look like when put into use, and seeing what else I need to have drawn. Feels kinda bare though, possibly because volcanoes are kinda hard to do scenery for.<br /><br />In addition to this stuff I've also got checkpoints, working doors, a mostly finished script, and I've been working on implementing more enemy types and doing more level design. I'm currently saving like 40-45% with dictionary compression on the script text.<br /><br />I now officially have no responsibilities until late August so I'm going to be able to work on this game full time. I hope to have it done this year.
