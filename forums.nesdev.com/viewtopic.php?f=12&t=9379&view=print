		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Do the DMA registers get destroyed after a DMA block has been transfered?  If they do not get destroyed, does the source address register continue where it left off after a DMA block update, or does it still hold the starting point of the last DMA block?  Same thing with the DMA legnth register.  Does it count down to zero during a DMA block update, or does it still hold the legnth of the previous DMA block?<br /><br />I want to know if there is a faster way to upload an individual 16x16, without updating them in groups of 8, or spending additional vblank time reseting the DMA control registers, just to get the bottom half of a sprite in.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the parameters for the transfer remain the same until you choose to change them. So it's always going to be the exact same transfer until you alter the registers. I could be wrong, write a test ROM and find out. But I see no reason why the DMA registers would become altered by having the DMA transfer activate. But it's possible, afterall the NES's VRAM Pointer for $2006 is also used in rendering. So DMA registers could be modified during DMA. <br /><br />BSNES *probably* should have the behavior correct if you don't have a flash cart or copier to test on real hardware.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have myself relied on SNES DMA regs being updated as it runs. That's pretty common.<br /><br />No game intentionally relies on the HDMA reload issue to my knowledge, but that tiny difference once per frame ended up throwing off the main menu in Circuit USA somehow.<br /><br />What I'd really like to know more about is the 1/1/1 SNES' DMA glitch. When DMA starts near an HDMA end and vice versa, the entire system crashes. I want to emulate it, but it's hard to test what's happening when the entire system crashes on you <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

And STP is useful for test ROMs. Less code than sei; stz $4210; stz $4211; bra $fe =)<br /><br />This doesn't just freeze the CPU, I suspect what's happening is the program counter is being corrupted. Sometimes really weird stuff happens, like the screen fills with gibberish and random sound effects start playing. It's ... something to behold.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If the PC is being corrupted and you can make it crash where you want maybe the PC corruption is just causing it to be misaligned with the opcodes? Maybe stick some NOPs after where it would crash and see if you can make it recover? Just a random thought though. I've never heard much about the DMA glitch other than it existed on the original version of the hardware.

As long as the amount of non-WAI/BRK code is kept to a minimum to reduce the chance of hitting anything else than one of those instructions when PC gets corrupted (<em>if</em> that's what's happening). This obviously won't work if PC ends up somewhere in I/O space <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
