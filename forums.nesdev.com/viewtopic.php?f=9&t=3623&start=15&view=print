<br />
<br />Well, it varies with games, SMB 3 seems to have the most variations (of games I've played).  For instance, on the World 2 overworld map, the drums hit MUCH harder than the rest of the sounds and almost drown out the other sounds.  Also, things like coins make more of a "boing" sound than a sharp "plink/clank" sound.  It's really odd the way this happens.   More than anything, I find the treble just seems to be turned up with respect to other sounds.  I dunno, I'm not much use in the realm of audio equipment.

However, Akumajou Densetsu, the Japanese version of Castlevania III, appears to run flawlessly.  Does anyone know if Akumajou Densetsu will run on a Gametech Neo Fami or Yobo FC/Generation NEX with a 72 -&gt; 60 pin adapter?  If it does, this could very well mean all of the famiclone compatability issues stem from just incomplete conversions from 60 to 72 pin cartridge slots and not from missing components in the NOAC itself.  I would suggest trying other Famicom games with a converter, but of the incompatible list (that I'm aware of) the only game with an alternate Japanese version is Castlevania III, the rest of the games (to my knowledge) did not have a Famicom version at all.

<br />dunno, does it play one but not the other? The point I am making (or trying to make) is that the incompatability with some US games may be due to the fact that NOAC was developed as a Famicom player and so rather than being from incompetence or negligence from the designers of the NOAC the issues are actually from slight variances in hardware between the two systems combined with the fact that the 72 pin is perhaps an "incomplete" conversion from the 60 pin and really just allows US catridges to fit rather than completely converting the NOAC to a US NES clone.
<br />
<br />Another interesting (and sort of unrelated) thing I just discovered, as it turns out the Jakks Pacific Namco/Ms. Pacman/Atari Flashback use NOAC with ports of the original games to Nintendo format.  It appears the NOAC is one of the most versatile backbones of compact and inexpensive gaming machines in existence.

<br />Thats more related than you think.  The use of NOAC in other things is a big reason it hasn't been fixed for accuracy.  While they may sell 50K NES clones, theres literally tens of millions of other devices (Atari, INTV, other TV systems, computers, kiosks, childrens toys, etc) that use the NOAC.  None of those care about perfect compatibility, so nobody will put in the time and money to correct the known problems.  They simply don't care.  They especially don't care when people don't notice the differences from a real NES.  NOAC is now being replaced by 16 bit or higher chips like ones from Sunplus, so a cheap correct NES clone isn't likely.

<br />
<br />Well, I mean, the small differences are negligible for most games and they don't bother me at all.  Like I've said before, if you play a DOS game on 2 different computers, it will play a little differently, so I just treat it like that.  I would still like to know if Akumajou Densetsu will play on a Yobo FC or Neo Fami because that would mean aside from the sound variance it is actually a dead on Famicom replication.  I just don't see any other way to explain the already amazing compatability and accuracy (in terms of actual gameplay) to a real NES.
<br />
<br />And while I'm talking about TV games, has anyone made (besides hackers) a Genesis on a chip system like the one used in the Radica Sega Legends TV Game?  From what I understand, Sega used off the shelf components rather than custom chips and therefore is easier to replicate.  It wouldn't surprise me at all if a Genesis clone was 100% compatible given that fact.

<br />
<br />one more time, can anyone out there explain this a little more clearly (using less NES terminology)?  Also, is there some way to rectify this or is it pretty much an unfixable glitch?

<br />
<br />attitude problem? how do you figure? I have a real NES, a mint one in fact, that I've had since I was ~5 years old and it still has an original 72 pin that is probably in better shape than most people's replacement connectors.  I bought my Yobo FC online for $18 plus $6 shipping just to check it out, and I like it so much I have it in my entertainment center instead of my real NES (mostly for conservation of my mint system, as well as better reliability and I like the Yobo controllers which won't fit a real NES).
<br />
<br />I just find NOAC an interesting concept and I don't think people are giving it the respect it deserves and just brush it off as inferior "junk" rather than really acknowledging it and perhaps finding ways to correct the few problems with them.  In fact, I bet Yobo or Messiah would pay out a decent sum of money if someone took the time to figure out how to get compatability to 100%, so in many ways its time better spent than just meddling with old NES's which Nintendo would destroy if they could so they could sell you the games again on virtual console.  
<br />
<br />I mean, honestly, I don't even like paperboy that much and I could give a shit about Castlevania III or Gauntlet, so for me my Yobo is pretty much fine the way it is, but as an Engineering major (mechanical) who plans to go to law school for patent law, the NES and clone situation is the exact kind of situation I would be dealing with so I find it intriguing.  Maybe some of you should as well.  
<br />
<br />Oh, and if anyone read far enough to read this, could someone inform me about the paperboy controller glitch in more laymans terms?

Messiah doesn't care because they are planning to use the extra graphics features of the broken NOAC.

Next is the super picky people who will notice any tiny difference, only original is good enough.  Then there are (hopefully) most of the people here who are working on real games.  They design something with graphics and sound specifically for the NES, then it is all different on the NOAC.  Music sounds wrong, colors are different, etc.  Average person may not notice, but these people have been working hard to get their game perfect.  Lots of my stuff simply doesn't work on the clones because they are made as cheap as possibly, like tiny power supplies. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">17daysolderthannes wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Oh, and if anyone read far enough to read this, could someone inform me about the paperboy controller glitch in more laymans terms?  so how is that different from any other game?</div>
<br />In the NES, one of the wires on the controller is not connected (open bus).  When Paperboy reads the controller it is expecting that to return a 1.  In the NOAC that wire is connected to 0, so the game doesnt get the result it wants.  This is inside the NOAC chip, so it is not physically fixable.  You could likely write a game genie code to get Paperboy to work.  Most other games will mask off that wire, so they don't care if its a 0 or 1.
