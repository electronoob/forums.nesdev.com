He clearly expected everyone to read the Python code to figure out how his creation works (He said it himself, &quot;the documentation is in another castle!&quot;).  <br /><br />This is what I had to do just to not get Python to bark an error:<br /><br />-Install Python 2.7<br />-Install something called setuptools<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools</a><!-- m --><br />-Run setup.py install in the <span class="posthilit">Pynes</span> folder<br /><br />And there was no command line problem at all.  Here is what you have to do.  Open one of the example programs.  See that call to '<span class="posthilit">pynes</span>.press_start()'?  Place a 'True' in the call.  Now it will output asm.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I started something similar in ruby a few years ago.  This appears to be a templating library that outputs asm or you could think of it as a meta-programming library that outputs a NES program instead of a python program.  Tools like these are useful because among other things they reduce copy and paste of code fragments and can make code more succinct and readable.<br /><br />When I was @ Intel working on their internal automated build system, they had ugly and huge (epic) build scripts written in XML.  Every version of a driver had pages and pages of XML describing the build--it made your eyeballs bleed.  The worse part was that each build script was about 98% similar to the rest so there was tons of duplication. And they were editing this stuff by hand!  So I wrote a ruby library that could slurp up xml and produce ruby code and a DSL that emitted valid XML build scripts (the templating part like <span class="posthilit">pyNES</span>).  This reduced code verbage by probably 75%.  Some coworkers loved it and used it, others smiled and stuck with raw xml in notepad.<br /><br />Moral of the story..........I forgot.

Now that I think about it, he may have had a brainfart coding the &quot;press_start&quot; routine and put False as the default args when he meant to put True.  So you can find that in the __init__ file and change that as well.
