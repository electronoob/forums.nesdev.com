		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok. I got the game "Earthbound" last night from <a href="http://www.nesreproductions.com/" class="postlink">NESReproductions</a> and I must say that it works beautifully (and he does stellar work).
<br />
<br />&lt;/plug&gt;
<br />
<br />But, since i'm learning how to do this same thing myself, I opened it up and compared my notes to what it actually had to see if they were consistant. But... they were different in some places.
<br />
<br />Which makes me <strong>VERY</strong> confused so if someone can please help me out, i'll explain.
<br />
<br />First, what the <a href="http://nesdev.com/NES%20EPROM%20Conversions.txt" class="postlink">NES EPROM conversion chart</a> says:
<br /><strong>TKROM &amp; TSROM (mapper 4):<br />PRG socket:</strong>
<br />Bend up pins 1, 2, 24, 30 and 31 (or cut tracks 2, 24, 30 and 31)
<br />Solder pin 2 to hole 24 (A16)
<br />Solder pin 24 to GND (OE)
<br />Solder pin 30 to hole 1 (A17)
<br />Solder pin 31 to hole 2 (A18)
<br />
<br />And what was done <strong>differently</strong> to the PRG chip (that I can see)
<br />*Pin 31 was not bent up.
<br />*Pin 1 was soldered to pin 32
<br />*Pin 22 was soldered to pin 24
<br />*Pin 31 not soldered to hole 2
<br />
<br />Now this diagram sheet says that pins 2 and 22 are connected on the PCB (as per the <a href="http://nesdev.com/NES%20ROM%20Pinouts.txt" class="postlink">ROM Pinout chart</a>), but that's still not a GND. 22 is "/CE", but I believe that 2 is A18. The GND is #16... and no wires are connected to it.
<br />
<br />On the other chip, the conversion instructions say:
<br /><strong>CHR socket:</strong>
<br />Bend up pins 1, 2, 22, 24, 30, 31 (or cut tracks 2, 22, 24 and 30)
<br />Solder pin 2 to hole 24 (A16)
<br />Solder pin 22 to hole 31 (CE or CHR /A13)
<br />Solder pin 24 to hole 2 (OE or CHR /RD)
<br />Solder pin 30 to hole 1 (A17)
<br />
<br />And what was done <strong>differently</strong> to the CHR chip (that I can see)
<br />*Pin 1 was soldered to pin 32
<br />*Pin 31 was soldered to pin 32
<br />
<br />Now, looking at the <a href="http://nintendoallstars.w.interia.pl/romlab/nesmod.htm" class="postlink">ROM Laboratory site</a>, I see that he followed that way of modification.
<br />
<br />So I hope you can see my confusion. Is there something i'm missing? I looked REALLY hard at it with a magnifying glass and spent quite some time making sure I checked both accurately... and there were just these differences to what was written on that chart and what I saw on the modded cart. Now obviously the cart works... so does the file need to be updated?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I got a few questions on this issue, as I'm trying to figure these rewiring tricks:
<br />
<br />Does "CE" exist or even when it's written "CE" they mean "/CE"? The same question for "OE"?
<br />
<br />How are these values logically evaluated? What represents a 1 and what represents a 0 here? To force a 1 can you use "+5V"? To force a 0 can you use "GND"?
<br />
<br />Am I way off track here?

<br />Yes. In TTL, a logical 1 is an electrical +5V, and a logical 0 is an electrical GND.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Normally, there never is "CE" or "OE", but always "/CE" and "/OE". The / (wich originally is a bar above the signal name, but with how computer text work it was replaced by the slash) means that the chip is enabled if /CE is to logic zero, "CE" would mean that the chip is enabled when the logic 1 is applied, and zero would disable the chip.
<br />In other word "/CE" (inverted chip enable) = "CD" (chip disable). Both would mean exactly the same.
