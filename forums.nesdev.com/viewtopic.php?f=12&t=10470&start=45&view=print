My schematic capture tool has no way to directly write out a JPG/PNG. I've been googling for a solution but I will probably just leave it up to whoever wants it to figure out how to convert the PDF to an image on their own. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I'm still having a hard time understand why some people want an image over a PDF. I don't see what the difference will be...the schematic is way too large to ever fit on a single screen all at once and still be able to see anything. So whether you have a PDF/Image will make no difference. You will still either have to zoom in and scroll X/Y or click and drag the image around with the mouse. Not sure what I'm missing here...

Maybe some trick with the PDF to force it to use a nice bitmap font as part of the export process.

The volunteers have provided awesome feedback so far. I'm just waiting for one more person and then I will post a first release. Also, I did end up adding the multi-color busses since people seemed to like the idea. It looks really cool (at least I think so). And if you don't like it, just use the monochrome schematic. Lol.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello all. I would like to present the first official public release of my SNES schematics. Special thanks to the volunteers who helped me rid the schematic of the most obvious errors prior to this release.<br /><br />I have included both color and monochrome schematics for you in case you prefer one over the other. I have also included the schematics in both PDF and PNG format. I would highly recommend using the PDF as opposed to the PNG since the PDF is fully text searchable and much better quality.<br /><br />The ZIP file not only includes the schematic but also the pinouts and pin definitions for each of the major IC components.<br /><br />I will post these to wiki.superfamicom.org sometime later today as well.<br /><br />I <span style="text-decoration: underline">very much</span> welcome feedback in the form of general errors, annoyances, mispellings, formatting suggestions, etc..<br /><br /><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/schematics/snes_schematic_release_latest.zip" class="postlink">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/schematics/snes_schematic_release_latest.zip</a><br /><br />--<br /><br />Some notes about this release:<br /><br />If someone could tell me how to properly setup the PNG export in GIMP so that the quality of the PNG is better that would be great. Right now I just tell it to target 600 pix/in output so that the height/width of the PNG is about the same as original non-legible schematic. If there is some way to properly calculate the pix/in or output resolution so that it looks nice and crisp please let me know so I can fix it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />A case-insensitive search for &quot;unknown&quot; in any of the pinout PDFs will quickly locate any pins with unknown purposes. There were quite a few signals which have unknown direction (i.e. in/out/inout) as well. I think the most important unknown signals are those on the PPUs (e.g. FIELD, /VCLD, /HCLD, /OVER, etc, etc, etc). There are a lot.<br /><br />On that same note, I wouldn't bother filling in information for any signals that are unconnected since they're don't-cares anyway. But if you really want to for completeness then feel free to tell me and I will add the info.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Looks great! Congrats on getting that done, and many thanks for releasing it to everybody!<br /><br />The EXPAND signal is just a general purpose connection between cartridge and expansion port (it doesn't have an direction assigned, and isn't assigned to be active low). In the Satellaview it is used to forward SYSCK from console - via 100 ohm in the cartridge - to the EXT port (but one might be allowed to use it differently in other hardware setups).<br /><br />And /IRQ on Expansion Port... I would assume that it was intended to have direction from Expansion to CPU. So both cartridge and expansion could trigger IRQs. Of course, theoretically the other way work, too, for forwarding /IRQ from cart to expansion, but I would guess that nintendo didn't intended it that way.<br /><br />And /RESET on the Cartridge slot, normally it's output to the cartridge... but, as far as I know, the official japanese &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; flashcarts do actually use it the other way around (to reset the console after game-selection from the flashcart menu).<br /><br />Oh, and, I think, &quot;Work RAM&quot; would sound more common than &quot;Working RAM&quot;.<br /><br />PS. EDIT: hmmmm, &quot;snes_schematic_release_latest.zip&quot;? Then... what will the next release be called, latest_v1.1?  :-)

I guess I'll just remove the direction then. The reason I made it active-low was because of the 10k pull-up on that line. The pull-up will pull the line high when nothing is connected to it at the expansion port. So that leads me to believe that it is meant to be active-low.
