		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The wiki says the skipped cycle occurs around cycle 328 on the pre-render scanline.  Wouldn't the cycle that is skipped have to be something not critical to rendering?  Cycles 320-335 are needed for fetching the first two rendered tiles, right?  So how would you be able to skip one of those cycles without disrupting the rendered image?
<br />
<br />Up until now I've been skipping the final idle cycle (340) since that's the one that seems most logical to me (plus it's easiest).
<br />
<br />Not that I disbelieve the tests... it's that that I don't understand how that would work.  I seems to me the skipped cycle would be best suited to be either one of the unused sprite fetch cycles (256-319) or one of the final dummy fetches (336-340).
<br />
<br />If the skipped cycle is indeed at or around 328 -- does that affect the rendered image at all?  Are 8 of the pixels on odd frames distorted due to an incomplete fetch?

<br />
<br />It's really an informal number. I haven't done a hard test of the exact time yet, so use whatever works best. The point is that it's near the end of that scanline (which I guess is what I should have wrote). Someone like Quietust might be more interested in pinning it down exactly and determining how it affects PPU rendering.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Heh, alright  =)
<br />
<br />I'll keep it at 340 then.  That seems to be the most logical cycle, not only because it's inactive, but also because all other cycles are used for byte fetching.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When I performed my testing on kevtris's 3-in-1 board (wherein I wrote a program, had kevtris run it, then examined the data dump it made), I verified that the actual cycle dropped was #340 (of 0-340) - in other words, the last one.
<br />
<br />It's possible that the <em>flag</em> for dropping the extra cycle is toggled somewhere else.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah... that's interesting.  You mean like if the PPU is on at say... cycle 320... the last cycle will still be skipped even if the PPU is shut off before cycle 340?
<br />
<br />I'd imagine it'd be difficult to test something like that to find out exactly where it is.  But I'm always being suprised with what you guys are uncovering.  =)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What I was trying to test was at what point PPU rendering had to be enabled via $2001 for the even/odd flag to be toggled with respect to CPU writes. Specifically, what range of times you could do
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ldx&nbsp; &nbsp;#$18<br />ldy #$00<br />stx&nbsp; &nbsp;$2001<br />sty $2001<br /></div>
<br />
<br />on that scanline with PPU rendering generally off and have the flag toggle (or vice-versa, PPU rendering on but turn it off momentarily). Battletoads is the only game I know of that enables PPU rendering late in the frame, but it does it way late so the timing of this isn't important (this causes a different dot crawl pattern than normal, which the latest Nestopia 1.28 accurately handles, as long as you have the NTSC filter on and field merging off).
