		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />With how much retro games have gone up in price in the last 5 years or whatever due to it being trendy, I honestly get kinda paranoid whenever I buy anything used that’s a well-known title and under $50. I know a lot of the time they do cleary state that it’s a repro if it is, and it’s not super hard to tell (when you’ve already bought it, that is), but is it actually common for people to sell blatant repros as the real thing? Maybe I’ve just been living under a rock.<br /><br />Also, even though people may clearly be selling a repro (as in not trying to pass it off as legit), they still don’t always say. I’ve noticed this a lot on sites like Etsy (which comes up often if you go to the “shopping” tab on google), and that also kinda bothers me because it seems it’d be easy to still fool someone who isn’t knowledgeable.<br /><br />Really the only time I’d be okay with buying a repro is for something like Nintendo World Championships (since I can’t think of anything less cliché), or for games that are still like &gt;$200 used (like Earthbound or Megaman 7 for instance.)

So, not some random Chinese seller who's going for a few quick bucks, but a community that is really into NES games and who really takes a huge effort to create high quality boxes and manuals.<br /><br />So, why do they do this? Why do they create reproductions that can be clearly considered fraud by making them look like legitimate releases?<br /><br />Using the original artwork is fine. After all, it <em>is</em> a 1:1 copy of this very game, so it can just as well have a copy of the artwork.<br /><br />But why do they include the Nintendo Seal of Quality and why don't they put a big, fat &quot;Reproduction cartridge, created by NintendoAge&quot; on the front? Are these people fucking nuts?<br /><em>This</em> is the fandom? A community who has no problems creating authentic-looking, but non-authentic NES games that regular people then confuse for rare releases?

That's the whole point of this discussion: Those games are designed to look <em>exactly</em> like a legitimate release.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankWDoom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">it's more like fan art than anything else.</div><br />If you want to do fan art, do it and upload it to DeviantArt or whatever.

Not everybody has deep inside knowledge into everything Nintendo-related. Not everybody is an expert. You cannot treat a random Joe Anybody the same way as you treat people on this forum. If somebody knows &quot;Castlevania&quot; and &quot;Contra&quot;, he might not get the idea that this box of &quot;Miracle of Almana&quot; is <em>not</em> an authentic release.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankWDoom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">they're a world apart from someone pumping out straight counterfeits.</div><br />According to this logic, printing an authetic-looking 300 dollar bill is not producing counterfeit money becaus a 300 dollar bill doesn't exist in reality.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankWDoom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">the seals are clearly misuse</div><br />Not only the seal. Also the note &quot;Licensed by Nintendo for play on the Nintendo Entertainment System&quot; and &quot;Made in Japan&quot; are clearly lies. And using the Nintendo and Konami logos is dubious as well. As is the complete omitting of the real source of creation.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've heard from both collectors and resellers that the large amount of fakes are taking the fun out of finding stuff.  Not stuff like F1 Race, but usually late-release and rare stuff like Panic Restaurant, Little Samson, etc.  Wouldn't be surprised if there are fake copies of stuff like Contra out there too, even though it's extremely common it still sells for more than it costs bootleg makers to make it.  If you're selling something rare these days, you pretty much need to open up the cart and take pictures or people won't take it seriously.  And there has been a fake Stadium Events board found that look nearly identical to a real one, fake maskROMs and everything.<br /><br />Even some homebrew stuff is getting a little confusing-looking.  Check out the box for Dead Tomb:<br /><a href="https://twitter.com/CollectorVision/status/987494513902931968" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/CollectorVision/status/987494513902931968</a><br />Says Nintendo Entertainment System, no trademark/endorsement disclaimer?  Has Acclaim logo, I guess they bought the rights to it, but I think most people who grew up playing NES consider that a warning label, haha.  Not the same as what's being discussed here, but I thought it was interesting.

The big N love their C&amp;Ds, Konami probably won't give two hoots, but putting a Nintendo seal of Quality on it is probably enough to make Nintendo go after it. <br /><br />People want to live the dream, people love the box more than the game, so people make the box to sell the dream.So you can have a nice neat box of your favorite game siting on the shelf. Then as soon as there is coin their is people making a scam.Then people who own the rights and then make proper new releases get yelled at because they are scamming the community and that others do the work for free and release it for free  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />
