I presume this would be prerendered.<br /><br />I love this art direction. My one and only nitpick is that i think those angled legs of the signal tower could be made to look less jagged while retaining the angle if, they wanted to.

You can see an example of this in the Yu Yu Hakusho fighting game for the Mega Drive, where players can jump between the foreground and the background. It looks slightly distorted, but not much more than real-time scaling/rotation at such small sizes.

But the sprite changes here look more involved than &quot;hide everything but the whites of the eyes&quot;, needing a separate sprite sheet for this scene. This would be more practical to animate if not all actions (therefore not all sprite sheets) are available while in a backlit zone.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Ambient vs strong local:</div><br />This looks like a mix of clothes palette swapping and an overlay sprite for the muzzle flash. The <em>Haunted</em> games so far have skin color changes for health and clothes for difficulty (or for having been slimed in the second one). The muzzle flash looks doable so long as it doesn't have a whole bunch of enemies on the same scanline. I get the impression that this will be a more atmospheric game, along the lines of <em>Metroid</em>, as opposed to &quot;we're tossing four zombies at you, sprite limit be damned&quot; as in the <em>Haunted</em> games.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The KS text also mentions ambitions of scaling sprites based on z depth.

You can easily layer sprites to use more than 3 colors per 8x8 block. Yes.<br /><br />Look at my Flappy Jack game. The main character uses 2 different palettes for his body, 1 other palette for the plate he's holding, and a 4th palette for pancakes in front of him. I was close to the 8 sprite limit any time a pancake missed and crossed through the plate area.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=14961">https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=14961</a><!-- m -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This looks really good. There are still some tropes I would have appreciated being broken (white male protagonist being one), but that aside, it seems like it'll be interesting enough in terms of gameplay and visuals to pick up. <br /><br />Just as before, the backgrounds are the graphical strong point (The sprites still feel a bit rigid, and other objects feel a bit awkward, like the distorted proportions of the Game Boy and its lack of visual depth). But, if this game continues to look as promising as progress comes along, I'd be glad to have a copy. <br /><br />That said, the kickstarter video was cute, but I would have preferred things like footage of gameplay instead, and can't help but think that since the only gameplay-related things released were mockup gifs, crowd sourcing may have been a bit premature.

He's a jedi. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  (assuming he's still their main programmer) I only think crowdsourcing is premature if it's a team who never completed a game before with no demonstrated competencies. Then one would hope for a demo or real game footage. This is like a dream team. Very high level of confidence.
