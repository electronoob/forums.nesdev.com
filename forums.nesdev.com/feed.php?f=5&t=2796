Do you mean the status bar at the bottom? There are no more than eight tiles in each scanline, and the background is solid. Also notice the blank lines between the playfield and the status bar. I'm guessing sprites, with the display list getting rewritten during the blank lines.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Mar 18, 2011 9:56 pm</p><hr />

I don't remember which doc, but Charles told me himself that is was probably a bug from the older TMS video chip logic<br /> - tiles can access 512 8x8 cells<br /> - If 8 pixe left shift bit enabled for sprites, sprites won't wrap horizontally around the screen.<br /> - the top 16 pixels of the display can be left static and untouched by X position for a fixed bar display<br /> - the left most 64 pixels of the display can be left static by the Y position of the display for a status bar on vertical scrolling screens.<br /> - The SAT (sprite attribute table) is convoluted in its layout for X and Pattern bits<br /> - VRAM isn't fast enough to complete blit/transfer too.

It is very handy, considering the fact that many SMS games (especially earlier ones) use it to generate parallax effects of the playfield. One problem with the SMS is though, I think you cannot modify the Y scrolling value within a frame (I'm not so sure about it) and because of this you cannot do things such as a static status bar on the bottom of the screen and the upper part scrolling vertically (you have to jump through hoops to do this on the NES but at least this can be done). There is a hardware function to lock the first two rows of tiles in position to make for a status bar though. However, it is a bit limited as two rows isn't much (not to mention that these two lines are off-screen in GG mode and thus useless for GG games) and many SMS games actually don't have information such as scores and remaining life displaced onscreen (the default screen height of 192 lines may also be a factor).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4653">Gilbert</a> — Wed Mar 16, 2011 6:55 pm</p><hr />

Objectively speaking, I believe the NES wins in the sound department. Subjectively speaking, I think the SMS has better graphical capabilities, with the only real disadvantages being that you can't flip sprites or bankswitch tiles, and that the number of available tiles is smaller because their VRAM is also used for screen maps ("name tables") and sprite data ("OAM").<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Does the SMS VDP's data port allow loading tile or map data during active picture time (that is, not during vertical blanking)?<br /></div><br />I believe it does, reading and writing, but there's some kind of speed penalty.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">MottZilla wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Also many NES games thanks to CHR-ROM have lots of animation very smoothly that I did not really see in any SMS games I've played though I haven't played a ton.<br /></div><br />I think it's possible to update a decent number of tiles per frame on the SMS, but unfortunately a lot of that time is wasted on updating the player's tiles, partly because of the lack of sprite flipping.

If that wasn't the case, I believe we'd have seen many more impressive SMS games.<br /><br />EDIT: Another advantage I can think of about the Master System: I'm pretty sure it has a built-in scanline counter, which means that raster effects are much easier to perform.

It's said that in general the 6502 family can do stuff more efficiently in one cycle (or something like that), so at the end the CPU is not that much an advantage for the SMS.</div><br /><br />That's exactly right. To put things into perspective, most opcodes on the NES are between 2-5 cycles, because it does multiple things per cycle. On the Z80, <em>everything</em> uses a multiple of 4 cycles per command. As for the actual instruction set, both processors have their strengths and weaknesses. For example, being able to easily do 16-bit operations on the Z80 is pretty useful. However, the zeropage and the special (faster) ZP addressing mode on the 6502 is quite handy too.<br /><br />Though, it'd be nice to be able to flip the BG tiles, like you can on the SMS, but then again, I think the SMS can't flip sprites. On the other hand, neither could the MSX, and that's still a pretty highly regarded system itself.<br /><br />I dunno, I don't think it's the capabilities of the system that makes it better, it has more to do with how you work within the restrictions.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Wed Mar 16, 2011 11:32 am</p><hr />
