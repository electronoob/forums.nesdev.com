Python (or any similar quick scripting language: Perl, PHP, Ruby, etc) will make your life so much easier. Being able to work with your assets (level data, graphics, enemy data, etc) in an easy-to-read/write format, then automatically convert them at build time, is incredibly important for a good development workflow.

I would have never touched python on windows but now this less an issue and the linux subsystem does help for those tools.<br /><br />I did start to write my editor but never finished. Maybe in another 10 years I will have some progess on it, who knows? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />@FrankenGraphics<br /><br />I included a screenshot of my current color theme that I use with my new C project. It mixes files from my older and new project just to give an example out the color syntax looks like. I use a font that reminds me of my dos days.

That's what really sold me on using Python for NESdev purposes.<br /><br />I'd say scripting languages like that are also very useful for lookup table generation, with how important that is for many NES things.

I found it while using xfce and use it every day for many small tasks. The fact that it has tabs is a plus.<br /><br />@NovaSquirrel<br /><br />I didn't use it yet for nesdev, mostly for work but the creation of quick data is useful, like you mentioned. Before I would have dome some quick hack in c# in a winForm and would have wasted so much time over a trivial task.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Python is kind of handy, its good for small quick stuff and for testing dumped RAM to make sure things are doing what they should be doing. However for anything I tend to depend on long term, c# I find is a better alternative. It is easier to maintain and the debugger is better with edit'n'continue which makes it a better pay off for more complex things over time. But for a simple split these words into lo,hi tables Python all the way. <br />Its not really a new thing, BASIC 2.0 on a C64 was used for the same purpose. Python is just the new BASIC, in 2007 I would have just used VBS, I still have some 'tools' written in VBS that I use...

I'm used to .net 2 so I guess it must have changed so much that I wouldn't recognize the language any more <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

You'll get more speed from knowing vim's motions, but using the mouse is a nice crutch.

It just became an habit since the rise of ide under windows.<br /><br />I remember the time when we didn't have those thing, no intellisense or context menu under dos. That was the time when I used turbo pascal, turbo c or qb45.  It was great for the time. Now we are too spoiled with all those gadgets they give with their ide <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> I need to learn vim someday, would love to. Thanks for the tip!
