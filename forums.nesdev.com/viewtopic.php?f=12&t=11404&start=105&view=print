Press up or down to move the sprites left or right. Press select to toggle the sprite layer.  Press A to toggle vertical  plasma and b to toggle horizontal plasma.  Press Y or X to decrease or increase the raster split.  Press L to change the background color.  Press R to reset to defaults. (Some of the toggles will mess up the timing for the scroll text).<br /><br />This demo shows that the black flecks (blue flecks in this demo) are where mode 2 is bleeding through the sprite layer.<br /><br />If nobody beats me to it I'll get a video posted soon.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.morganleahrecords.com/augustus/blackheart/rom/horiz.sfc" class="postlink">http://www.morganleahrecords.com/augustus/blackheart/rom/horiz.sfc</a><br /><br />Another interesting thing, now that I've changed the sprites, is that the 40 pixels of junk is part of the sprite layer.  If you move the horizontal split close to the right edge of the screen it will settle down and you can clearly see a copy of the sprite layer.<br /><br />edit: updated to add ability to increase or decrease sprite xpos, change background color, raster split

I've PMed you.<br /><br />I'm not actually all that worried about trustworthiness - you do look like a reliable character, as much as an online presence can.  It's mostly a formality, since you can never be too careful on the internet etc....<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It's hard for me to tell if your mtest_* stuff has the same behaviour as Pan's demo, re: black specks.</div><br />I don't think it does.  The specks seem to show up on the sprite layer when it's used to mask the garbage in the BG layers that results from the mode switch; I wanted to see what the background layers did, so I didn't use a sprite mask.  That flickering black area in my test is uncensored.<br /><br />There are only three tiles in my tests - the colourful Mode 7 tile (which is zoomed in 2x), the partly-transparent Mode 1 numeral tile (BG1), and the blue textured Mode 1 backdrop tile (BG2).  All three tiles are mapped to every entry in their respective tilemaps (which is really easy since they're all tile #0).  Anything else that shows up on the screen is garbage - I suspect that area is mostly black in my case because the VRAM is mostly empty...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I sincerely do not think the SNES initialisation code is what's responsible for the &quot;speck&quot; problem.</div><br />I'm with you there.  I think the specks would show up regardless.  But the speck pattern has been observed to change between runs, and I thought <em>that</em> might be related to initialization.  After what tepples said about the NES, though, I'm not so sure that's the explanation - it could be unavoidable hardware behaviour:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A properly-initialized NES can start in one of four relative alignments between the CPU and PPU. The Super NES may have more or fewer, given the phase of the DMA unit.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Augustus Blackheart wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Here's a modified version of Pan's horizontal split demo.</div><br />Cool.  I know the results I'm getting from higan aren't exactly correct (and my laptop is too slow to run it at full speed, so the music crackles), but I can still see most of what you're talking about.<br /><br />I think I'll still enhance my test code, simply because I need to learn how to do all this.  But apparently there's no rush...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">This demo shows that the black flecks (blue flecks in this demo) are where mode 2 is bleeding through the sprite layer.</div><br />Okay, so there may actually be a way to jigger this so the flecks are fairly unobtrusive.  I mean, they're already fairly unobtrusive compared with the mess underneath the sprite mask, but if they could be made to appear in a similar colour to the sprite mask itself, they'd be almost invisible...

I'm not seeing the flecks changing color when the mode 7 logo goes under those spots.

No IRQs, no checking counters. Each line consumes exactly 1324 cycles. Then run your NMI routine (doesn't even have to be a real NMI since you know you're in Vblank now) to do your game logic, then sync up to V=0,H=0 and start the next frame.<br /><br />That will require some learning on your part in how to calculate exact cycle times and penalties. But set an IRQ for V=261,H=~330 or so and then use WAI. Have that bail out so that you're now within 6 clocks of V=0,H=0. You can actually sync perfectly to V=0,H=0 but it's complicated, so you'll have to learn that on your own.</div><br /><div class="quotetitle">93143 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A cycle-timed game engine (or part of it) could be the best of both worlds.</div><br />Okay, so I tried the static loop thing over the weekend, and it doesn't seem to work properly if I use mostly fast cycles (the mode switch point drifts by an average of no less than one master cycle per scanline).  Using mostly slow cycles, if I'm careful with the position of the fast cycles (ie: where I put the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">nop</tt>es in relation to the time-delay loop) I can nail it and get a wobbly equilibrium.<br /><br />That's right, wobbly.  The position of the switch is different on every scanline except the first, and changes every frame.  This is with the first scanline perfectly synchronized and rock solid every frame (at least in higan where I can actually see the blasted thing), using an interrupt designed to exit at a constant dot position given an entry point anywhere in a particular eight-pixel range.<br /><br />The interaction with the DRAM refresh and/or the HDMA seems to be really finicky.  I suspect I won't be drawing any text boxes with the brightness register, and I may well end up just using an H-interrupt for the mode switch.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Though there <em>was</em> a tantalizing scenario I ran across where some frames had a ~1-dot offset per scanline, resulting in a diagonal seam, but other frames were perfectly synchronized with no wobble (after a slight offset between the second and third scanlines)...  maybe it <em>is</em> possible to figure this out, and maybe even write game logic around the timing events...  I'd have to have separate game engines for launch model and later-model decks, though, because IIRC they changed how the DRAM refresh works...  and this is starting to sound like a recipe for never getting the game done...<br /><br />...<br /><br />Also, I added a column of sprites to mask the garbage.  For some reason I don't see any artifacting; those infamous flecks don't show up even when I set colour #0 to bright green and the constant colour to bright red <em>and</em> change the mode switch to target Mode 2 instead of Mode 1...  Maybe I should change the colour of the sprite mask; it's kinda dark on a real CRT...  It would be great if the flecks didn't show up in the final game, but why wouldn't they when they do in the Anthrox cracktro?
