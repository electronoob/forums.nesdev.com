<br />
<br />I have IrrKlang (the Free edition, Not Commercial) and I want to use FCEUX as a base... Problem is I cannot program a Binary Decoder that well so If I were to do so, I have to find a example based on compatible code...
<br />
<br />Here is what I have:
<br />
<br />Currently it is not tested or set up proper yet (WIP), It is supposed to be at $4018[MUSIC] and $4019[SOUND] (It's invalid, but can be used in my NES Remake in the future).
<br />
<br />but I have values taken instead at $4020-403F (FDS SOUNDRAM, Makes this void for real use) because of Mappings that must use #$01, then chosen RAM value currently, Which is not what I want...
<br />
<br />If anyone has a solution or some other, Please Post Here... Thanks
<br />
<br />Remember: IrrKlang says it should not need a licence UNLESS it is a commercial version, I do not use the commercial version, so my stuff remains free

<br />Yes, but with WAVs under emulation...
<br />
<br />I may not have to do it, and will throw the progress away, since any music library selection for .NET is not compatible with both VS2010 and GPL, I tried Google, but there is no easy sound solution...

<br />You could always use a music library not for .NET. It's not like you need a solution in 100% verifiable CLR (such as something that would run on Xbox 360 or Windows Phone 7) because FCEUX itself is not for .NET.

A multichannel mixer without pitch, volume, and pan control is really easy to write.

<br />
<br />Partially, Sound is not implented...
<br />
<br />I may actually use LibOGG/LibVorbis instead of IrrKlang, so I am making it a new project.
<br />
<br />Actually, There is no example code for LibOGG, so this is still far from decided...
<br />
<br />(Sigh, If only WinMM works...)

<br />
<br />Nice thing to hear about your attempts
<br />
<br />Mine has been replaced, using SDL, But it is complaining about Internal Object errors, and there may be more code errors with my lack of knowlage in C/CPP

<br />Thanks, May try it out...
<br />
<br />EDIT: it doesn't seem to have a Loop function of course...
<br />
<br />I may look somewhere else tomorrow night!

It's just a decoder.<br /><br />Since you'd be streaming the audio, so you could make it loop.  When it runs out of audio data, you'd just restart the file and decode from the beginning.<br /><br />How much do you know about audio streaming?

<br />
<br />Looks like it, but it depends on which version of GPL and LGPL you're dealing with.

<br />
<br />One way around that (which I've done in the past) is rather than looping to a specific time in a file, you break the file up into "intro" and "loop" portions.  Play the intro file once, then loop the loop file afterwards.  Works very well.
<br />
<br />[s]EDIT: but that also is not possible with his register descriptions.[/s]
<br />
<br />EDIT2:  actually it is... since he doesn't specify the file names.  Maybe playing music track 1 could actually load 2 separate files.

A non-looped song is actually could be thought of as a looped song which loop point matches its end.
