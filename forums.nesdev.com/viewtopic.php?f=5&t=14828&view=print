I assume this refers to a man-in-the-middle run on localhost that keeps documents cached as long as possible. Like other TLS MITMs, it would need to act as a private CA, verifying the certificate presented by the site and locally generating a certificate for each site, and the private CA's root certificate would need to be installed into each browser. Rahsennor currently uses Polipo, which can cache legacy cleartext HTTP but <a href="https://www.irif.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~jch/software/polipo/polipo.html#Tunnelling-connections" class="postlink">appears to act as a non-caching tunnel for HTTPS</a>, not a MITM. Any suggestions?<br /><br />Rahsennor: If you can provide enough additional information to formulate a question on <a href="http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/tour" class="postlink">Software Recommendations Stack Exchange</a>, I'd appreciate it. <a href="http://meta.softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/336/what-is-required-for-a-question-to-contain-enough-information" class="postlink">Here's what they require</a>.

Thanks for trying to help, tepples.<br /><br />I use Linux, with a strong preference for open source software. I'm currently running polipo on localhost as a personal caching proxy, to reduce both bandwidth and latency, using up to 20 GiB of disk space and 1 GiB of RAM. I also make use of the selective censorReferer feature (which removes the Referer header unless it matches Host) and server blacklist, but I can always give the blacklist to Unbound.<br /><br />I've used Squid before. It's been a while, but I remember the configuration was a nightmare even without HTTPS, it didn't improve user-visible latency, and the inability to cache partial downloads made it worse than useless in poor network conditions, since it prevented recovery from dead connections.<br /><br />I think that covers the features I'm after:<br /><br />1) runs on Linux<br />2) preferably open source<br />3) can handle very unreliable outgoing network<br />4) latency more important than throughput<br />5) can censor headers for privacy reasons, preferably with special handling for Referer to work around dodgy hotlink prevention<br /><br />Not sure if 5 is still relevant for HTTPS. Or anything else relating to HTTPS for that matter. I wasn't even aware that unencrypted HTTP was considered obsolete until every website I visited started dropping support.<br /><br />I'm also not familiar with MITM in this context. I usually hear it used for things that are intentionally hidden from the endpoints. I just set the http_proxy environment variable to &quot;http://localhost:PORT/&quot;. If that's what you mean then that's what I'm doing.

Here, the proxy is in a position of trust because it has the technical ability to modify the response body, such as to skip the trip to the origin server entirely if it already has a cached copy, or to insert advertisements or other malicious data. Comcast, for instance, has been known to insert advertisements into legacy cleartext HTTP sessions, such as to add an in-page pop-up notifying the subscriber that a newer model of wireless gateway is available.<br /><br />Normally, HTTPS includes measures to prevent a proxy from modifying or even seeing the response body on its way to the UA. One of these measures is public key infrastructure (PKI), which requires connections to include a certificate attesting that the origin server is authorized to speak for a particular hostname. To prevent a malicious proxy from making its own certificates, the browser requires the certificate to have been issued by a trusted third party called a certificate authority (CA), with its own &quot;root certificate&quot; included in the UA's certificate store so that the UA knows that the CA's certificates are legit. But because a man in the middle needs to be able to speak for every hostname, it needs to support acting as a CA, and you'll need to add the root certificate of the proxy's CA to your UA's certificate store.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Rahsennor wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I wasn't even aware that unencrypted HTTP was considered obsolete until every website I visited started dropping support.</div><br />Then I guess I must follow different forums from you.

The headers can still be seen by the site you are accessing regardless of protocol; HTTPS prevents anyone else from seeing or tampering with it. So it still is relevant, but less so.<br /><br />HTTPS does not prevent malware or anything like that, but does prevent an unauthorized &quot;man in the middle&quot; from adding such malware.<br /><br />They want to disable sensitive JavaScript features based on protocol, but I think it makes more sense to enable/disable them by user settings instead. (Although, what Mozilla/Google/W3C proposes could be used as a default setting.)<br /><br />Let's Encrypt is good though.<br /><br />My own server will continue supporting unencrypted connections forever, even if allowing some (or all) files to be signed and/or encrypted is added on later too.<br /><br />I too think we should see what proxies are available. I don't know how easily something might be written with Node.js or with Perl or something. In any case, this site no longer requires HTTPS and I am glad that it no longer requires HTTPS (and nocash also likes this); therefore, if you cannot set up the proxy for HTTPS, you can set up the proxy for HTTP instead.<br /><br />HSTS is terrible though.

How many hoops would I have to jump through to implement this HTTPS certificate hoo-hah? Are there any tools that could handle that for me, and pass non-sensitive traffic through a normal caching proxy?

Thanks again for trying to help, though I doubt there's an existing utility out there that would fulfill even most of my wishlist.
