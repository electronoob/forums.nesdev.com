<br />
<br />You just can't go very far before you must start thinking about the implementation of the ideas. I mean, you can come up with the plot for a game, the characters, etc. But the minute you start thinking about the levels and how big and complex they are, you must think platform-wise.
<br />
<br />Hell, with systems like the MSX1 you can't even come up with characters without thinking about the limitations of the platform, as it's sprites have only one color. So, in the best case, you should be able to come up with a character that can be represented well with 2 layers of sprites, if you don't want to compromise the other sprites in the same scanlines too much.
<br />
<br />For older computers, the kind of game you develop has everything to do with the platform, IMO.

<br />Of couse, you have to draw tiles with the system in mind. But how you assemble tiles in your game engine and all calculations that are done are platform-independant. Only tricks to simplify things aren't.

<br />No it isn't. Game Boy Color can use tile objects of odd width and height; NES can't.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I didn't mean what you're saying. Maybe you're right, I should clarify things a bit more :
<br />- All maps and tile related stuff is pretty much platform specific, but not totally, as from platform to platform, some things are common
<br />- All game engine main approach should be the less platform-specific as possible. Sure, your engine has to draw stuff to the screen and run sound on a specific platform, but the main idea will keep the same regardless of the platform.
<br />- All that have to do with calculations, collision detection, events, etc... isn't platform specific, and that is the most "annoying" part of coding a game in my viewpoint.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know Bregalad. The importance of the platform during design seems to be more important than just sound and graphics.
<br />
<br />Much of the structure of the game has to do with the platform. A very important thing in a game engine, for example, are the level maps and the scrolling engine. There are many things you have to decide when designing these. Will the levels be run from ROM or RAM (pretty much impossible on the NES without WRAM)? Compressed or uncompressed? How fast (how much data) can you write to VRAM each frame (affects scrolling)? What is the range of your index registers (will play a part on how you'll arrange/compress the data in ROM)? What kind of bankswitching is avaliable (also plays a part on the overall organization of the data)?
<br />
<br />I just can't go very far with the design of a game before entering the platform specifics. Of course, you could for example think about the physics, battle engines, and such logical things without thinking about the platform, but i guess that's it.
<br />
<br />You have to face it, with systems that are low on resources (CPU and PPU speed, memory, etc) you have to be very careful when designing a game.
<br />
<br />Of course it all depends on the kind of game you are coding. Today, many years after the time when 8-bit games were the newest thing around, we tend to push the old platforms to their limits, trying to implement ideas not used back then, ideas that tipically require more resorces than avaliable in older systems. With clever coding, we can overcome many of the limitations, but you have to know the machine very well.
<br />
<br />If you stick to coding pac-man or pong, then there is not much reason to think about the platform as these are games that require very little resources.
<br />
<br />I think it's all about how "powerful" the game is. You can't code a "powerful" game in a machine that's not as powerful, unless you know it's limitations and can think of clever ways to overcome them.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I mean all game logic isn't platform specific.
<br />You should of course design your game with the limits of the platform in mind (dont try to render a millions of polygons with the NES). But you shouldn't approach your code with platform specific opcodes, but with a main global idea of wich calculations or transfters are done, why, how, etc.. And then you can write routines that does the work on the sprecific platform. I think it's obscure to explain that, and I hope you understood well enough.
