I don't think either version looks <em>bad</em> at all, but the no-flicker version is definitely <em>better</em> on this TV in my opinion, and it's not to do with the perception of flickering (non-existent because it's 480i 30fps) but just the problem of interlacing.</div><br />Ha, very interesting! Thanks for posting.<br />But as Nesrocks pointed I won't worry too much with the NES + AV + HDTV combo right now (I wonder if there's an uglier way to play Nintendo).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">M_Tee wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I would consider taking a more marketable approach than &quot;flicker&quot; when referring to it though, especially since most consumers likely associate <em>flicker </em>with sprite flickering (for scanline usage). Something like &quot;Enhanced Color&quot; and &quot;Standard Color&quot; instead &quot;Flicker&quot; and &quot;X Flicker&quot; could be both more informative and sound more commercial.<br /><br />Then, somewhere in the documentation, or some &quot;learn more&quot; screen of text explain something along the lines of:<br /><br /><em>Enhanced Color mode alternates specially chosen patterns at a rapid rate to produce the illusion of more colors on screen. The effectiveness of this mode depends on your game hardware, type of display, and visual sensitivity. If you find the flickering of Enhanced Color mode distracting or uncomfortable, select Standard Color mode.</em></div><br />You're right about giving a good explanation on this in the instruction booklet.<br /><br />However I'll keep the name at title screen. First because it's not incorrect.<br />Second because there's no space to a bigger name (on screen and in image bank).<br />Third because I feel I would underestimate people if I replace a technical name to an easier one.<br /><br />I remember myself as a kid figuring out what &quot;SAVE&quot; and &quot;LOAD&quot; mean when I played Excite Bike (just to give a random example) - then a magazine explained and I loved to learn that. In fact I think that a <span style="text-decoration: underline">good</span> number of people from my generation learned English by ourselves only playing videogames (since there was almost zero games in Brazilian Portuguese back in the day). So if someone play this game to have fun - but learn a new concept as a bonus - to me this is edutainment at its best.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I presume this is already known, but according to <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/" class="postlink">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>, you can from a legal perspective &quot;remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.&quot;, provided that you &quot;indicate that changes were made&quot; and distribute those contributions under the same license. <br /><br />So in case you want to experiment with changing the mix, that's at least doable from that standpoint. Are you using the famitracker engine for sound?<br /></div><br />I don't have knowledge to change music in Famitracker. If I mess with these songs, I'm sure I'll destroy them! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

They just want to hook it up to the same TV they use for everything else, which has a fixed comfortable position in front of their couch. In &quot;real life&quot; I know a <em>lot</em> of people with an NES, but I'm the only person I know who owns an upscaler. Everybody seems happy with the &quot;worst&quot; but easy solution of just plugging it into their regular TV.<br /><br />I don't see why this isn't relevant to an NES developer? I think it's a good idea to consider the <em>actual</em> conditions your game will be played under. At least, that's why I'm interested in it.
