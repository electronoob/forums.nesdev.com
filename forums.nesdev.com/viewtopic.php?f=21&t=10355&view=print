		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is very odd. A lot of the requirements for small pixel fonts break many of the standard rules of thumb when blown up to full size.<br /><br />For example, the top end of the stroke (below the dot) in &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; don't meet the mean line. All the letters with descenders don't reach the baseline. The lack of an &quot;fi&quot; ligature is unfortunate given the specific shape of f here. The closed two-story &quot;g&quot; without a link is unusual. It feels like &quot;:&quot; shouldn't be a full x-height. None of the curved letters use any overshoot. The strokes in the &quot;v&quot; have less weight than almost all the others. <br /><br />All of these make perfect sense, given that you're trying to be faithful to the original bitmap font.<br /><br />As an aside, I personally really dislike one-story &quot;a&quot;s. The alternate &quot;y&quot; is more congruous with how curvy the rest of the font is.

I know I need to fix these things:<br /><br /><ul><li>Design fi, fl, ſi, and ſl ligatures and import them to FontForge </li><li>Add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overshoot_%28typography%29" class="postlink">overshoot</a> to bowls </li><li>Slightly increase weight of 'v' </li><li>Add a slight curve to the tail of the straight version of 'y' </li></ul><br />I haven't got around to designing the ligatures yet, but I've made a rough mock-up of what it might look like with either of two changes made: vertical overshoot by 1/8 pixel (1/40 of x-height) or reducing the thickness of horizontal strokes by 1/4 pixel.<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

Could you explain?<br /><br />The International Phonetic Alphabet assigns different meanings to 2-story 'a' (open front vowel) and 1-story 'ɑ' (open back vowel), and it prefers open 'ɡ' to looptail 'g'. There exist <a href="http://typophile.com/node/67538" class="postlink">&quot;infant versions&quot; of fonts</a> where 'g', 'a', and 'y' all have the alternate forms, but <a href="http://www.kidstype.org/?q=node/44" class="postlink">these don't especially affect children's reading performance</a>.<br /><br />As for METAFONT: Its model of modeling a glyph as a curve traced with a brush appears to be <a href="http://typophile.com/node/66159" class="postlink">falling out of favor</a> in favor of describing the outlines.<br /><br />Get a load of <a href="http://brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/forum/showthread.php?7725-Matthew-s-handwriting" class="postlink">this</a>.

I think I disagree, and prefer a shorter-seeming :.<br /><br />For some reason, the vector font feels too heavy in comparison to the original bitmap font. I'm not certain why; when I expand the bitmap font to match it looks fine.<br />I remember reading someone say that fonts in general should become slightly lower weight when larger? (But not as much as TeX's default font)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think I know why it got heavier when I vectorized it.<br /><br />The outline in a TrueType glyph is a quadratic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezier_spline" class="postlink">Bézier spline</a>, which consists of alternating[1] &quot;on-curve&quot; and &quot;off-curve&quot; points. The rasterizer draws parabola segments from each on-curve point to the next, with the parabola inscribed in the triangle formed by the two on-curve points and the off-curve point between them. A bit of integral calculus shows that the area of the parabola is exactly two-thirds that of the triangle. So to compute the area within an outline, you need to compute the area inside the polygon formed by the on-curve points, then add the area within the parabolas (or subtract it in a counter).<br /><br />Here's a simplified glyph drawn as a 4-parabola curve minus a 4-parabola curve. The O marks represent on-curve points, the X's off-curve points. I've drawn one of the triangles in blue.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
			<img src="./download/file.php?id=760" alt="on and off curve.png" /><br />
			<span class="gensmall">on and off curve.png [ 3.25 KiB | Viewed 4662 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div><br /><br />Let's assume that the glyph is 4 units tall. This means the polygon formed by the outer area covers 8 u² and each triangle 2 u². So the area of each parabolic segment is 4/3 u², for a total of 8 + 4 * 4/3 = 40/3 = 13 1/3 u².  The counter is half the diameter and thus one-fourth the area, so subtract a fourth of that: 40/3 - (40/3)/4 = 30/3 = 10 u². Now compare this to the bitmap glyph that covers only 8 u². Overshooting the bowl would only increase this discrepancy. A possible mitigation would be to make the counter bigger.<br /><br />Now a four-segment curve is slightly &quot;fatter&quot; at the corners than a true circle, with a radius varying from 2 units at the top, bottom, and sides to 3√2/2 ≈ 2.12 units at the diagonals. (An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Circle_and_quadratic_bezier.svg" class="postlink">eight-segment curve</a> is a nearly perfect fit to a circle.) If the were drawn with circular arcs instead of parabolas, the outer area would be πr² = 4π ≈ 12.57 u², and the total glyph would cover 3π ≈ 9.42 u², still much greater than the bitmap glyph.<br /><br />In any case, how much is standard overshoot? Doing 1/8 pixel, as I had planned, would produce a 2.5% overshoot.<br /><br /><br />[1] Technically, they're allowed to not alternate in the font, but the rasterizer acts as if an on-curve point is placed halfway between consecutive off-curve points and vice versa. Two consecutive off-curve points thus form a straight line segment.

A friend of mine &quot;&quot;maintains&quot;&quot; (for lack of better term) a TTF version of the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs-fonts.gif" class="postlink">UCS 6x13 &quot;fixed&quot; font</a> (part of any X11 installation) which took him almost 3 full months of messing about in FontForge to get working correctly -- and still only works correctly on Windows (will not work on OS X, neither of us are sure why).  The intention was to get the absolutely gorgeous font (perfect for terminals) but with Unicode glyph mapping, so that the end result allows for Unicode characters and UTF-8 encoding to work properly.  There is a .fon version floating around but UTF-8 breaks horribly if you use that.  I really wish native bitmap fonts were still supported in Windows and other mainstream OSes -- rephrased, I wish OpenType would have allowed for pure native bitmap fonts.<br /><br />Edit: Meant 6x13, not 8x16.  (Too many NES/SNES tiles/sprites on the brain!)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's not a question of the kind of spline as much as the type design. I could match the shape of a CFF cubic spline almost exactly by bisecting each segment and using a quadratic segment for each half. I'd bet font editors do the same thing when the user imports an SVG whose paths use cubic or arc segments into a TrueType font. But as I wrote above, a perfect circle would still have more weight than the bitmap circle of the same diameter.<br /><br />The fundamental issue is that in bitmap fonts, anything that's diagonal tends to be 30% underweight in the first place because it takes <em>n</em> dark pixels to cover a diagonal distance of √2<em>n</em> pixels. Round parts of small bitmap fonts suffer especially because they're made almost entirely out of diagonals.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you for your feedback.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">'a' (the bitmap loop is square on the right side; the vector's is an oval and a line)</div><br />Compare 'd' or 'ɡ' or 'q'. For 'a', I took 'ɡ' and flipped it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">'t' and 'l' (the arc of stem is longer in the vector version)</div><br />Probably the same phenomenon as overshoot: I need to make them longer to eat up the space between the letter and the following letter.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">'w' (I feel like the bitmap version implies something curvy on the sides)</div><br />Sketch out the curves you see and I'll play with that.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">'g' isn't remotely the same</div><br />Copy and paste this into a new document: &quot;Are you struɡɡlinɡ with debuɡɡinɡ eɡɡ throwinɡ?&quot; To type the alternate ɡ (Latin small letter script g, U+0261) into a Gtk+ application, press Ctrl+Shift+U 2 6 1 Enter. One problem is not all programs are aware of OpenType alternate glyphs. I could try playing with OpenType stylistic sets and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-feature-settings" class="postlink">CSS <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">font-feature-settings</tt></a> and just endure the ensuing <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15160897/font-feature-settings-what-is-the-correct-syntax" class="postlink">prefix hell</a> and complete lack of support in IE pre-10 and Safari.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">a closed g without a visible link looks terrible</div><br />The page you linked states that the &quot;link&quot; is also called a &quot;neck&quot;. Guess what a lot of classic video game characters lack due to graphical limitations, especially in sprite-based overhead adventures and RPGs. (ObNES: Does Link in <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> have a neck?) Here's the bitmap glyph I was trying to represent, along with an alternate solution inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobo_%28typeface%29" class="postlink">another typeface</a> that lacks descenders:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ██&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ██<br />&nbsp; ████&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ████<br />██&nbsp; &nbsp; ██&nbsp; &nbsp; ██&nbsp; &nbsp; ██<br />██&nbsp; &nbsp; ██&nbsp; &nbsp; ██&nbsp; &nbsp; ██<br />&nbsp; ████&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ████<br />██&nbsp; &nbsp; ██&nbsp; &nbsp; ██<br />&nbsp; ████&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ██████<br />Linkless&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hobo<br />closed g&nbsp; &nbsp; style g<br /></div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">the 'fi' ligature's kerning is substantially tighter than other letter pairings</div><br />That's one of the problems with working with quantized advance widths. If I widened 'fi' by one pixel, it would appear no different from fi with no ligature.
