I'm acting as a human compiler, more or less.</div><br />Actually this may be pretty cool to do, and pretty efficient too.<br /><br />The only problem is that personally I can only write command line tools for the PC, not GUI, so I can't develop a PC game.<br /><br />Do you use a framebuffer for displaying the game ? Or do you already simulate the BG and sprites of the NES ?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I wrote simple PPU and APU simulators. They aren't as complex as an emulator would need to be, just something that looks/sounds the same on the surface. The &quot;PPU&quot; just fills up a framebuffer on request, and the &quot;APU&quot; fills up an audio buffer. Their public interfaces are based around the NES code I would be writing, so PPU::latch(x) is like writing $2006, or PPU::write(d) is like writing $2007, etc.<br /><br />Getting the actual sound/video to the screen is done with <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/" class="postlink">SDL</a>, but could easily be replaced by whatever GUI framework is needed. The layer of code that connects the PPU/APU/input to the user's terminal is fairly minimal. I just happen to like SDL, and it's convenient for PC/Mac/Linux cross development.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, a pluggable PPU and APU simulator would be useful by allowing a game to be designed for prototyping on a PC and to NES piece by piece. Perhaps the APU side could be based on Blargg's Game Music Emu. But doing so would require extensions to the NSF semantics to support sound effects and other communication from the game engine to the virtual machine in which the NSF runs without having to completely reset the machine for every track.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Bregalad, I do intend to publish my NES game as open source in the long term, but not in the short term. A source code release is about a year off, I think. I hope to be publicly releasing a demo in a month or so, and a full release later this year. Source code I would make available later on.<br /><br />If you're looking for a source example of how to use SDL to make a game, I recently made a 3 day game for Toronto Game Jam, which I released source for. It doesn't have an NES style PPU/APU but it's a working example of how to get graphics/sound/input up and running: <a href="http://rainwarrior.itch.io/pastured-ewe" class="postlink">http://rainwarrior.itch.io/pastured-ewe</a>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually I think simulating $2006/7 writes or APU directly is too low level for this specific purpose. Not that it doesn't make sense, if you really care about a 1:1 port on PC.<br /><br />But if all you want is prototype your algorithm and code structure, I'd myself go for emulating one level higher, such as display metatiles and metasprites directly to the screen, as going any lower than that is a waste of time that will anyways be wasted a second time when ported to the NES.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Register-level PPU emulation still lets the programmer build the metatile and metasprite mapping algorithms in a high-level language. If you know your NES-side engine is limited to five 32-byte update packets per vertical blank, you can have the PC version attempt to respect this so that the game's speed doesn't end up tuned based on unrealistic expectations of video memory bandwidth.
