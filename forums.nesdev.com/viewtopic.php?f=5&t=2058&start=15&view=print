<br />I assume Color Dreams was dissolved few after this, with so much investiskment and so few profit. Why couldn't they work with Nintendo, since they were just serious professional devloppers ? And unlike Tengen, they didn't fury up with them or anything.

Essentially, they just didn't want to go through all the rigamarole involved in becoming Nintendo's bitch, so they went unlicensed. (The fact that they were a small, <em>small</em> company at the time and couldn't really afford to take the risk probably contributed as well.) I can't say as I blame them.

<br />Nintendo was pissed about it, from what I heard they supposedly had threatened to stop supplying stores that carried Color Dreams games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Perhaps for my "Mix 2" I'll consider all of this. It's my cherry, be gentle!For now I'm sticking strictly with what I can do with the most common donor carts and the power pad.  They are certainly tougher to come by than your average controller but I'm not planning to mass-produce these carts either. The shame is if I were to do this on the SNES I could have an option for pad-input, since there's the XYAB opposite the d-pad. Doesn't really work on the NES controller...there's 8 inputs but they're not logically set up. It would be fine on emulator but again, to me the point of doing this is to make the cart. Otherwise it's just a cruddy inferior version of StepMania.

<br />
<br />You could do what Smash TV does, where you use 2 controllers, one in each hand (vertically instead of horizontally, d-pad on top).  I've played Smash TV like that a lot, only takes a moment to get used to and it's comfortable enough.
