I am not certain but I remember reading this somewhere. It would make sense, because the Master Quest ROM was not leaked until after this Gamecube disc came out. Also, when you play the Master Quest ROM, it has Gamecube buttons in the top right of the Heads-Up-Display, instead of N64 buttons (Like when you play the game, the Action button and C buttons are from a Gamecube controller not a N64 controller).

<br />I knew dumping this to a cartridge would be hard to do but nothing is impossible impossible. Unfortunately it looks like nobody is willing to step up <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />first of all yes it was emulated, does that matter?
<br />second its not that noone is willing, but that its simply not cheap enough for someone to go "hey i'll have a shot at that and just hand it to someone". Its also not easy.

<br />Yes the emulated version is cool but being a collector I would like to own this in cartridge form. I have a Super Mario World famicom pirate on a NES cartridge which I think is very cool. Obviously I greatly underestimated the amount of time and effort it would take for this project. I understand now. Thanks.
