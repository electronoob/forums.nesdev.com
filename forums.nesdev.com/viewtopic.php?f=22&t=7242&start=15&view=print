<br />You might not need two buttons if you use acceleration/braking logic.
<br />Push right: gradually speed up until max speed
<br />A+Right: accelerate faster, with a higher top speed
<br />Let go: brake to a stop

<br />I used something like this in a Pong clone for PC that I wrote as a 1-hour challenge, and it worked well.

Most people don't have these crazy controllers, and I bet they are terribly hard to find outside of the US. In fact, here in Brazil I even had trouble finding a light gun!
<br />
<br />But ultimately, it's 3gengames' decision. He seems to like the paddle controllers, so he's intentionally designing the game for them, but if he decides to support every input device in existence, that's his call. I just think that not supporting the regular controller is a good way to lose players.

<br />And yeah, light guns here are so popular it's insane. And I love Kaboom!, even if it means limiting my audience, so be it. Kaboom without a paddle-type controller is not Kaboom! to me, so thats why I want it paddle only. I will make a controller type game on it probably, but only time will tell. I'll try to add something for controller guys though. Hell, maybe a light gun option too where the 2nd player could shoot bombs as they go twords the bottom? Like Pac-Man CE DX where when your about to die it slows down. LOL. Nah, thats just too insane. Don't count on it....[But that would be awesome!]

<br />Does that satisfy you? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />
<br />I am doing a run of 25 because I can get 25 carts for like $3 each locally that are NROM-128, which I HOPE this game will use, and maybe even another game....and then run them, make $5-$10 off each one sold, and buy a powerpak for easier cart testing and the other $120 to fund devcarts and buying bulk ROM's for future projects. The only way you can get carts really cheap and buying in bulk is like the only way you can do that.
<br />
<br />
<br />I've made about 4 NROM carts....and it's taken about an hour each. 25 hours of work might not be worth it to others, but I am actually kinda looking forward to it, it if happens. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />I think that's a pretty cool idea, but don't let my cheap ass be a factor in what you do <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />It brings up a point I really haven't thought about... I'm not sure how I'm going to release my project. I really want to produce it on a cart, but I'd like the option to put it out as a ROM as well. I get the feeling if I were to go the Retrozone route then it would be an exclusive deal where the only means of distribution would be there site, on a cart. I've also toyed with offering the ROM as a download with a "choose your price" payment system, like what Radio Head did with In Rainbows.

I worked on my first commercial project over the course of the summer and it has been interesting to say the least. For something like this, I actually think the 'Pay Whatever' model would really be good. If people like what you did, they can pay what they feel the game is worth. Of course you could also sell the carts on the side <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />But I like that idea alot, I just can't do it. :/ Oh well.....  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />But once I do a run of some carts, I'll release the ROM and source, you'll bet your life I do. I came to a conclusion I'll release the ROM to every project...it's just that the time to release the ROM will vary from nearly the same time to a couple months, maybe a year. That way everyone will get to play it, which I really want, and it'll have some time to make money. And actually, for my later projects that are better, I might just release the source. I only want enough money to make 5-6 different devcarts that I want, and then a powerpak to test code faster. I don't want any money after that. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> No reason. I got all the dev stuff, and I just like writing code. It's so fun. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />1) You should display a text before/after a wave indicating that the user needs to press a button for the wave to start.
<br />2) The fact that you can collect the bombs by hitting them with the side of the the water thing makes all of the first 4 demo waves too easy, at least on game pad.
<br />3) Seems to be a lot of empty space in the ROM, time to add some music mayhaps?

And I would, but I don't want to sit on this project for longer just to add a small small thing in that would only be on the title screen, I want to make a sound engine myself after this though, so in my other projects hopefully we'll have actual music and sound effects. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> For just over 2KB program space, think just from that the game is a good size program wise? I try to program to save RAM mainly, then speed in some parts like score keeping (6 bytes wasted instead of 3 with 24 bit math decoded to a 6 values buffer for whatever) but I tried my best I believe.
<br />
<br />And I must say, gonna throw this in, wouldn't be possible if I didn't get all the stupid topics/sometimes random IRC questions guys, thanks so much. Now just to finish all my other programs and I'll be very very happy to just start fresh again with a lot more experience and see what I can create then. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
