<div class="quotetitle">DragonDePlatino wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Heh, the reason your demo made me think that is because when I was playing it, I was thinking &quot;Oh, so the final game will be like this but longer&quot; not to mention, the controls feel like those of a finished game.<br /><br />I hope you don't mind me doing a little hack job of your game, but this is what I had in mind for the snow:<br /><br />I can PM you the edited ROM, if you'd like.<br /></div><br />There will be more variety once the game is complete as well. The the controls should feel a little better now there is an input buffer.<br />I don't mind, thank you for taking the time to edit it. I can see what you mean about the cyan but I'm not sure about having the ground colour being similar to the sky.<br />PM me the edited ROM when you get a chance and I'll take a closer look.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Gave this a try tonight -- love it!  Here are thoughts that went through my mind as I started it up and progressed:<br /><br />* &quot;What the hell, select button doesn't move cursor on title screen?  Oh, D-pad, okay&quot;<br />* &quot;No select on options screen either, just D-pad again...&quot;<br />* &quot;Start does nothing on options screen?  Oh I see, B is accept...&quot;<br />...started game, jumped around...<br />* &quot;The hell am I doing?  OH!  I can eat guys!  Aww yeah&quot;<br />...progressed to next stage easily, then...<br />* &quot;Oh crap, I fell in the water.  What's that metre in the upper left?  Is that my air?  Timer?  Am I gonna die?&quot;<br />...ate some more things, progressed...<br />* &quot;Oh, NOW I get it, the number in the centre of the screen indicates how many of the things I need to eat.  Eesh this is gonna be hard&quot;<br />...failed repeatedly at the next level, for quite some time...<br />* &quot;Ah ha, the metre is a timer of sorts, or maybe a health metre.  I better eat everything!&quot;<br />* &lt;much cursing at the stage requiring you to eat 8 fish or whatever they are&gt;<br />* &quot;This rain stuff reminds me of Mega Man 2, and the fact that it adds flicker to the sprites is acceptable but is it really worth it?&quot;<br />* &lt;figured out cheap technique for finishing the stage generally easy, feeling very proud of self, albeit guilty at same time&gt;<br />...then the level with the springs...<br />* &quot;How do these springs work?  Hrm, not like the trampoline thing in SMB, that's for sure.  Oh okay, I think I got it.&quot;<br />* &quot;Damn, now how do I eat these birds... Great, one at a time?  Oh wait, maybe if I hold down the button longer I can do some huge open-mouthed leap that chomps up a whole ton in one shot... HAHA YES&quot;<br /></div><br />Wow, that was fun to read and has given me a lot to think about.<br /><br />I didn't think about using select to move through the menus, It's been a while since I've played a game that works that way. That will be easy to add though. Not sure about using start in the options though, I'll do some fiddling with the menu later and see how it feels.<br />I did not expect people to be having as much trouble as they are with the fish level. I thought the level with the birds would of been more frustrating. I'd also like to hear about this cheap technique you used to finish the stage, you have me quite curious.<br />I know the flickering with the rain doesn't look the best but I'm going to try and use a different method for OAM cycling so the rain wont cause the other sprites to flicker. If I can't manage that, I should be able to at least reduce the amount of rain to lessen the flickering.<br />The springs are currently undergoing some changes so they will be easier to use.<br />There's no difference from holding the button, or pressing it, to lunge. Though now that you mention it, I'm getting some ideas, hehe.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Overall impression and score so far: 6.5/10.  Play control feels really good/smooth, guy moves almost a little &quot;too&quot; fast for my liking, but I think that's part of the challenge.  Love the art/style, looks cute/cartoony, like two characters you could really fall in love with (I started fantasising about box art).  Graphics remind me of sort of a mix of Mega Man 2, Snow Brothers, and Kickle Cubicle.<br /><br />I'd absolutely donate money to this on Kickstarter + endorse it much like I did with Lizard, no questions asked.<br /></div><br />Hmm, I'll fiddle around with the moving speed and see what's best. The only problem being that, if the player moves much slower, the gravity might need to be changed which would be a lot of work but I'll see how things go.<br />I'm really happy with the score you've given it. I'm glad you like the characters, I've been trying to find as many ways to give them as much personality as I can. I, too, have been fantasising about the box art but I'm trying to not get ahead of myself and focus on the game itself.<br />Once the game is finished, I going to release it for free, so everyone that wants to play it, can.<br /><br />Thank you for the entertainment and your critique.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Cool demo.<br /></div><br />Thanks!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6436">Krill</a> — Sat Feb 07, 2015 8:56 pm</p><hr />

Oh well, sorry about the post being messy, I'm still unsure of the best way to reply to everything and have it look neat.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">psc wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I had a chance to load this onto my Everdrive, and just wanted to say it looks great! The art style looks wonderful (character design is cute and full of personality, and the environments have great depth, lighting and detail) and the play mechanics are simple yet challenging. The rain effect looked excellent to me playing on my CRT.<br /></div><br />Thanks, I'm glad to here that as I have no way of testing Nim &amp; Nom on an actual NES and have been concerned about how it may look on a CRT.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />- The sprite wrap around seemed odd. Being able to walk from the right of the screen and appear on the left took me out of the experience somehow. Maybe have a hovering teleporter or portal in the air instead?<br />- The bounce controls on the springs took me a few minutes to figure out. You have to HOLD the jump button? Why not make it like in SMB where you jump WITH the bounce of the spring?<br />- Game title would be nice near the top of the screen.<br />- Cycling through the custom palettes was a bit hard to see on the CRT. Maybe include a larger color block next to the character so you can see what color you're on, or have a value displayed (&quot;color 1, 2, 3&quot; or &quot;red, yellow, lime&quot; etc)? I think because the character is small it makes the palette changes less noticeable. Not a big deal though.<br />- Maybe include two modes: Regular and Survival. The current game is like &quot;Survival&quot; mode in Street Fighter II, where your health is never fully restored. Just an option between two modes would be nice.<br /></div><br />- Hmm, I don't really have room to do something like that. Maybe it wont feel weird with levels that a designed to work with it, I haven't really had too much time to experiment with levels. <br />- I've looked about how other games have handled this and thought holding it would be best way to do it. Having to press the button will require a bit more work to have it not rely on a single frame, but I'll try and implement it and see how it feels. Regardless, I can always use both methods.<br />- Easy enough, didn't really think about this as the title screen was just thrown to together so I could have something to test the menu with.<br />- Okay, I can do this but I'll wait till the title screen is closer to being finished. Depending how the title screen looks, I'll have to do this differently compared to what it is now.<br />- I have planned to do this from the start, that's why there are the &quot;????&quot; selections in the menu. The problem is finding the best way for the game to play for both modes. Double jumping would be fine for a survival mode but would allow to much freedom for a more challenge based mode. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />This game seems very modern, like it would make a good app game.<br /></div><br />I could imagine with some changes, it would, but I have don't really have an interest in that.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Another idea: it would be nice if the flies did not damage or knock back the character. They could be like the equivalent of bonus points (or in this case extra time/life).<br /></div><br />I had it this way for a little while but it felt as if they weren't part of the game, or were unfinished. I does feel weird being knocked back by them so I'll fiddle around with this again and see if there is something I can do.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />3rd option: you could have both approaches. You could continuously hold Down or Up (rather than 'A') to do the current bounce, but you could also press 'A' (jump button) while springing to spring higher like in SMB/SMB3. Holding Up seems intuitive enough, I would hope.<br /></div><br />I'll probably stay with the other two methods. This sounds nice in theory but might be a little awkward while playing, especially if there is a lot going on.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />So, the two options you are suggesting are:<br /><br />1. Allow user to press and hold jump any time before the bounce.<br /><br />2. Only allow user to press jump during a short window of time before the bounce.<br /><br />If the goal is to make it easy to bounce, use 1. If your goal is to make it difficult to bounce, use 2. Either could be a valid design decision, but if you're going to make it difficult to bounce on springs, you should at least justify it by making that difficulty part of the fun. I don't think that applies in this particular case.<br /></div><br />I think it would best to have both methods, as it isn't much work to implement both. That should cover the way of thinking for most people.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6436">Krill</a> — Wed Feb 04, 2015 5:54 pm</p><hr />
