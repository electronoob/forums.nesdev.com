		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Alright.  Things have been fine for a while, but in chat I have learned about sprites and conflicts.  This has only come into play now that I've been trying to add NSF support to the game.
<br />
<br />What basically happens is that some graphics don't show up and others are "moved over".  I've even gotten an interesting attribute table being wrong.
<br />
<br />So...  I didn't get everything, so I figured I'd try doing a step-by-step look at this problem.
<br />
<br />One thing that was mentioned involved how I'm clearing the memory.  Basically, I'm doing this right now:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">RESET:<br />SEI&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; disable IRQs<br />CLD&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; disable decimal mode<br />LDX #$40<br />STX $4017&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; disable APU frame IRQ<br />LDX #$FF<br />TXS&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; Set up stack<br />INX&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; now X = 0<br />STX $2000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; disable NMI<br />STX $2001&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; disable rendering<br />STX $4010&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; disable DMC IRQs<br />LDA #$00<br />STA $2003 &nbsp; &nbsp;; set the low byte &#40;00&#41; of the RAM address<br /><br />vblankwait1:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;; First wait for vblank to make sure PPU is ready<br />BIT $2002<br />BPL vblankwait1<br /><br />clrmem:<br />LDA #$00<br />STA $0000, x<br />STA $0100, x<br />STA $0400, x<br />STA $0500, x<br />STA $0600, x<br />STA $0700, x<br />STA $0200, x&nbsp; ;FLAGGED CODE<br />LDA #$FE<br />STA $0300, x<br />INX<br />BNE clrmem<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />vblankwait2:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; Second wait for vblank, PPU is ready after this<br />BIT $2002<br />BPL vblankwait2</div>
<br />
<br />I recall hearing that $0200 should have all $FE's in there instead of $00.  When I do that, the graphical things seem to go away, but the triangle wave starts playing low notes for no reason, leading me to believe something's wrong.
<br />
<br />Another person had mentioned trying to put in code to skip the NMI routine a couple of times if a flag was set.
<br />
<br />Anyway, is what I'm saying making sense and are there any easy answers?
<br />
<br />Thanks and this'll be the last time I bug you <strong>this</strong> year!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Make sure you aren't writing anything to $2007 once rendering has started.<br /><br />On NMI, you should do everything drawing related <em>first</em> before calling other areas that aren't VBlank critical (like joypad reading).  Your drawing code should also be as fast as you can make it to avoid running out of time.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">STA $2003 	; set the low byte (00) of the RAM address<br /></div><br /><br />just felt like noting that the OAM address ($2003) is only 1 byte wide, so you're not setting just the "low byte", you're setting the whole address here.<br /><br />Minor -- and it's not causing any problem in your code -- but a misnomer in some docs and I figured it's worth mentioning.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I recall hearing that $0200 should have all $FE's in there instead of $00.<br /></div><br /><br />Whoever suggested this probably said to do this because they were expecting you to use $02xx as your "shadow" OAM page (which you would later DMA to actual OAM via a write to $4014).  Filling OAM with $00 would result in a cluster of unused sprites in the top left corner of the screen.  Filling with a value between $F0-FF sets their Y coord so all unused sprites are offscreen (which is the preferred way to handle it)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">When I do that, the graphical things seem to go away, but the triangle wave starts playing low notes for no reason, leading me to believe something's wrong.</div>
<br />
<br />If $0200 is your shadow OAM page, it shouldn't have any impact on anything else!  Sounds like you're having the following problems:
<br />
<br />1)  you're putting variables in your $0200 page when you shouldn't be (if this is your OAM page, you can't have any other variables here!)
<br />
<br />2)  you're using unprepped RAM for your music and possibly drawing routines.  Well not really since you're prepping it by clearing it -- but you still should be keeping an eye on possible variable contents.  Maybe give your drawing and sound code a once over and look at variables and make sure you're setting all of them the way you want before you're relying on their contents.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />and happy 2008!

<br />
<br />In your code you are not writing $FE to  $0200, you are writing it to $0300.
<br />
<br />If audio uses that memory and expects it to be zeroed, that might explain your audio weirdness.

Each NSF uses a specific sound engine, and you never know when that is going to conflict with what you have already programmed, unless you really know the sound engine used.

<br />
<br />I've heard of ways of doing music without using NSF's, although they sound quite hard.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you are using a well known nsf generator, you should be able to find out what memory ranges it is using (without just using a debugger).  For example FamiTracker you can download the <a href="http://famitracker.shoodot.net/downloads.php" class="postlink">NSF driver source</a> then see its ram usage in driver.s.  Theres about 16 bytes of zero page and 100+ bytes of other ram variables defined for version 2.  If you haven't made space for those, it will definitely be messing with your own stuff.

<br />
<br />With that we can try and figure out what memory to avoid using.  If its hosing  $0200-$02FF  you could have your sprites use a different memory page.
<br />
<br />I've never used NSFs.
