<br />In a scenario such as GBA where you probably have an incredibly large amount of registers by comparison, I can totally understand the value of naming them rather than going by address.

<br />The widespread names for the GBA sound registers have almost the same problem, which is why I use my own header files for its sound registers.

<br />The only difference is that the "Direct Sound" isn't existant on the 8-bit Game Boy, other that that is it the exact same registers I assume.
<br />I would have no idea why they have different names when writing a GBA programm as opposed to a 8-bit GB programm, since those are the exact same sound registers.

<br />For one thing, 8-bit Game Boy programs are generally written in Sharp Z80-clone assembly language, while GBA programs are written in C and ARM7TDMI assembly language. Developers must have used this as an opportunity to make minor improvements to the register names.

<br />I'm going off-topic again but I never understand how all GBA's music can be done with only two channels.... I assume they are mixed by software to simulate more channels ? Then all the "Sound DSP" should be done in software ? Or am I totally misunderstanding something ?

<br />Yes, and for several months, GBA homebrew developers had a urination contest as to how fast they could mix <em>n</em> channels in software. The eventual winner was <a href="http://www.apex-designs.net/tools_aas.html" class="postlink">Apex Audio System</a>.

<br />The real challenge would do pitch modulation based on another channel's waveform in software (like the SPC700 does in hardware).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry for consecutive posting, and for reviving an old thread, but...
<br />The GBA sound hardware now really interest me. I wasn't especially interested before, but that software mixing thing really keep me excited to the point of having trouble sleeping without thinking to it. It is so fun !
<br />Not only the GBA is the only machine to provide both analog and digital channels (and sorry for those who doesn't like those therms), but also the digital channel is both endless and very limited, wich is extremely exciting.
<br />I've listened now lot of GBA music and analyzed it as much as I can.
<br />
<br />Most GBA games have stereo sound by using one PCM per stereo channel, but a few games tend to prefer mono output and use only one PCM channel (for RAM usage ?) or to have one channel for music and the other for SFX, and having both mixed by hardware in mono.
<br />
<br />Plus, the overall mixing quality and # of soft channels seem to vary a lot from game to game. As I undestand, the output frequency is most often 16kHz, and sometimes can go up to 32kHz. Is that right ?
<br />The "lowest" commercial mixer I found was in early Capcom GBA games, such as Megaman Battle Network 1 and 2, or Breath of Fire Advance that seems to be able to mix only 2 music channels and 2 SFX channels (all of this with an output quality of arround 16kHz, but I'm totally unsure). MMBM1 seems to use samples wich shords, to simulate more channels. Since even this allow very few channels, the games uses a lot the original GB APU to use basic waveforms. This became half-voluntary with MMBN, where this Square-Wave music really fit the game very well. However, Capcom may have abused it a bit, I think.
<br />BOF's music looks much less good on GBA than SNES, and that is a shame.
<br />Now, most recent Capcom games seems to have an upgraded mixer that allow more channels.
<br />Most game has average mixing quality, and I think the top commercial mixer is found in Golden Sun, and Golden Sun - The Lost Age (wich most probably contain the exact same sound engine).
<br />These doesn't use the original GB channels at all for music (they use it for several SFX), and they provide stereo music with at least 8 channel as far I can juge, the mixing rate should be somewhere arround 32kHz, and I'm unsure if there is even digital echo/reverb. The only downside if that all SFX are just WAVs (or a bunch of notes played in the original GB fashion) and not any actual mixed SFX.
<br />
<br />I'd like so much to write my super software DSP for the GBA, allowing one million channels stereo 32kHz with a milion mixing features, reverb, and oh well. I just don't have a single idea on how the GBA work sound aside, and I don't have time to do it now, with my current NES projects.

<br />Then prototype your mixer on the PC, using the Allegro library for audio output. If you want my help in writing a GBA framework around your mixer, then register on forum.gbadev.org and ask me there.
