It's in the most efficient format I can think of.<br /><br />[node name, pulled up, [[driver's gate node, driver's opposite node]]]<br /><br />Just eval() and dump lines into pull-up and driver dictionaries.<br /><br />Each of the drivers are implied transistors. Since the redundancy in the previous data sets was confusing I tied each transistor to a single node, meaning there are lots of nodes without any drivers. Due to transmission gates there isn't a way to know which node to give the transistor to, so it's claimed first come first served, which doesn't always yield convenient results. <br /><br />I purged the OAM and palette RAM cells since they took up 4560 of the 8773 nodes. The hard-earned cell nodes are listed for reference...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A few minor updates:<br />1. I found and fixed a few missing vias, both located near some of the sprite logic; any gate lists you've made should probably be regenerated. Specifically, nodes 755 (connected to t4167) and 10662 (connected to t6212) should now be node 2 (i.e. GND).<br />2. I also reordered a few transistors in the secondary OAM address counter (so that it increments properly during the &quot;initialization&quot; that takes place during the first 64 pixels of each scanline).<br />3. I've identified a few more areas of interest - the secondary OAM address counter mentioned above (and the signal which selects between it and &quot;primary&quot; OAM), part of the sprite logic (a pair of shift registers up at the top which are fed from D0-D7 or D7-D0 based on the horizontal flip bit), and the location of the $2007 write buffer: <strong>open bus</strong>. Yes, that's right - when you write to $2007 to store data in VRAM, the actual byte you wrote sits on the internal I/O data bus for a few cycles before going out to the data pins, so writing to another register too soon (less than 3 CPU cycles later) will cause that value to be overwritten.<br /><br />I've also identified some more stuff that doesn't simulate properly:<br />1. Sprite evaluation - when it tries to increment to &quot;next sprite&quot;, it occasionally skips over a whole bunch of them, likely because some of the transistors connected to the clock lines are triggering in the wrong order (e.g. PCLK0 goes low and PCLK1 goes high [or vice-versa], there's a brief instant where <strong>both</strong> are high which causes things to glitch). I'm not sure I know how to solve this.<br />2. Writing to $2007 - for some reason, the &quot;open bus&quot; value is decaying after about 1 pixel instead of remaining indefinitely (on a real PPU, it lasts a significant amount of time), most likely due to a similar clock glitch, and the result is that the bottom 8 bits of the VRAM address end up getting written instead. If you insert an immediate write of the same value to $2002, then it'll get written properly.<br /><br />[edit]<br /><br />Just spotted and fixed another error in the logic for sprite #6 (2nd from the left) which was hardwiring one of its outputs to VCC (and also creating a short between VCC and GND that the netlist generator somehow missed).

Does anyone ever think about this?</div>Many times.<br /><br />There's actually enough information in the 2C02's output to completely reconstruct the original color data, all 9 bits of it. The parts for it are even fairly affordable.<br /><br /> I think the real modern problem is that very few modern televisions do the right thing with a 240p signal, and upscaling the output is kind of a pain. But to add insult to injury, even if we added an upscaler, I don't know how many televisions will do the right thing (by which I mean &quot;not add latency&quot;) for 480p input.

I don't remember the details, but I think blargg discovered this a while ago.</div>Ok, not subpixel. But that's 2C07 only, and I was under the impression (because of how much slower the CPU was) you couldn't consistently align it to one pixel, so as long as it's acceptable to snap emphasis to pixel boundaries it should still be doable.<br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">When I described this technique, I hadn't considered emphasis.</div>Yeah, I sat down and generated a lookup table of all pixel-long=8-sample sequences; there are 425 of them for every single combination of color and emphasis. An extra counter is required to keep track of phase, because of the fpart(341×2÷3) and so colors $31 and $35 and $39 can produce the exact same 8-sample sequence. Several colors are indistinguishable once allowing for -30dBFS noise; e.g. color $10 with red emphasis quantizes as the same as color $32 with all emphasis bits set.
