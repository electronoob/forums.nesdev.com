I haven't updated my page at all (lazy <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />  but I've been hard at work.<br /><br />I'm fairly confident in saying that the NES core is 100% accurate now, and I've run over 4000 ROMs through it.  It supports 213 mappers now (more with "sub mappers", but 213 NES mapper numbers).  The chip is 96% full, and I need to move up to the next size chip I think.  Every single Blargg test passes 100%, every timing test I've made, and every CPU test I've made are all a go.  I have 2 more "possibly wrong" games to test now... I had three but I bought one of them off of ebay and surprise surprise, it does the same thing on the NES as it does the FPGA.  I suspect the other two games will be similar.<br /><br /><br />I was working on getting all the mappers refined and tested, which I did during the large ROM tests I performed.  So, I'm pretty sure the ROMs are as good as they're gonna get for now.  <br /><br />The ines V2.00 thing is hot right now because I'm at the perfect point where it is easy to add and it will simplify things greatly, so I hope to get that finalized so I can flesh it out some more.  Once people think it's a good idea I will move and define all the submapper things and post a list and all that.  <br /><br />The hardware has reached the end of its useful life, and I am working on the final production prototype of the hardware.  The "back end" (NES playing) part is all finished now, and I just need to work on the front end now, which is the user interface, game loading, etc.   Currently it uses USB and a windows host program to send data and debug and all that.<br /><br />The hardware's going to get much smaller (I want the footprint of an NES cart or a tad bigger) and it will be vastly simplified.  Controllers will be all USB based, so I do not need lots of hardware to support weird controllers and stuff.<br /><br />Once the front end is done, I will be in a better position to make more consoles for it.  The first addition will be PAL NES, which should be pretty simple, and then Atari 2600.  I have the complete chip schematics for the RIOT and TIA, so that will be relatively simple to do I suspect.  From there, it's up in the air.<br /><br />Ideally, I want at least 3 different consoles supported before I attempt to go into production.  We'll see what happens once I get that done.  Speaking of production, the cost of the FPGAs went through the floor, and with my china connection, the cost could be well within range of what people are willing to spend.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=230">kevtris</a> — Sun Sep 17, 2006 2:34 pm</p><hr />

Kevtris got a lot of people's hopes up with his <a href="http://tripoint.org/kevtris/Projects/console/" class="postlink">FPGA NES</a>, but it looked like hardware manufacturing issues would keep the project from ever seeing a public release.  Then there was the One Chip MSX, a FPGA based console that also seemed very promising... yet it didn't seem to go anywhere.<br /><br />Well, I got the following email this morning, which makes it seem as though the One Chip MSX will finally get released!  While many people have released NES emulators for Windows, etc, is there any chance that we will see NES emulators released for the One Chip MSX?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Bazix is pleased to announce we will soon start taking orders on a brand new One Chip MSX. On our website, we have published several pictures, new specifications and an updated FAQ on this FPGA-based computer. To sum up the most essential improvements: The One Chip MSX now is MSX2 compatible, comes with two MSX cartridge slots, two USB ports and is delivered in a stylish blue-transparent casing. <br /><br />At our website you can have a more detailed look at the new One Chip MSX, which is expected to go into production late 2006 or early 2007. As you have shown interest in the One Chip MSX in the past, and as the first batch of One Chip MSX computers will only be available on a limited offer, we invite you to join our new One Chip MSX newsletter. <br /><br />People subscribed to this newsletter will be the first to know when we start taking orders on the One Chip MSX. If you want to make sure you don't miss out on this unique opportunity we suggest you subscribe yourself as well. <br /><br />Thanks in advance, <br /><br />Bazix VOF<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bazix.nl/onechipmsx.html">http://www.bazix.nl/onechipmsx.html</a><!-- m --><br /></div><br /><br />There is also a little more info <a href="http://www.msx.org/Bazix-reveal-further-One-Chip-MSX-details-and-newsletter.newspost3891.html" class="postlink">at MSX.org</a>.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=94">Jagasian</a> — Sun Sep 17, 2006 10:43 am</p><hr />
