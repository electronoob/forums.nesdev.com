It's very close to done but still has some issues that need to be worked out.  I posted about it <a href="http://famitracker.com/forum/posts.php?id=4901&amp;highlight=" class="postlink">here</a>.  I have uploaded a Linux build which I know works at least in Ubuntu 12.04 and requires SDL.  I know at least one person on NESDev has been after me to get off my butt and get this done.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" />

I've only heard it inside VMs, one on a ridiculously underpowered host and the other on a behemoth machine.  They both sounded bad.  The slow machine obviously.  But I'm wondering if I need to fiddle the SDL setup - Famitracker ran about 2x normal speed in the VM on the fast host.

The toolbar buttons lack tooltips. Nothing in the Help menu works.</div><br /><br />Easy one first.  This is Qt FamiTracker-0.4.1.1 which is based on MFC FamiTracker-0.4.1.  MFC FamiTracker has rolled to 0.4.3 beta, so FTMs that were created with MFC 0.4.2 or later won't load in Qt 0.4.1.1.  Eventually, when I get to Qt 0.4.3.x that will be feature-compatible with MFC 0.4.3.<br /><br />With regard to the half-speed issue, I haven't yet implemented the Sound configuration.  What settings do you have in FT in Wine on that tab?  Strange that in one of my VMs it ran at 2x speed...likely a SDL config issue.  I'll look at implementing the Sound config dialog.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What's a &quot;horzline not implemented&quot;?

And I see a &quot;QThread::setPriority: Cannot set priority, thread is not running&quot;.</div><br /><br />Most of that is just like I indicated in the post on the FT forum: for now the program is very unabashedly console-chatty, mostly because it helps me remember what's left to do or figure things out.  The &quot;horzline&quot; is just a graphical element that doesn't really add much so I will either remove that message or implement it.  Those messages will disappear as releases happen that incorporate fixes, updates, etc.  The QThread:: message is an annoyance but I can easily work around it.<br /><br />Thanks for trying, and apologies for the annoyances.  I'm hoping to work through them through feedback from people like you.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" />

I mean it sounds like frames of audio were being repeated, and low pitches were distorted beyond recognition. The slowdown tended to increase when I navigated through menus and dialogs and especially when I alt-tabbed to Firefox to write my testing report. Xfce Task Manager reported fairly high CPU usage.<br /><br />Yesterday, I got FCEUX audio working in Wine. So it appears Wine audio improved greatly from the version in 10.04 to the version I'm running.<br /><br />EDIT: <a href="https://github.com/christopherpow/nesicide/blob/master/TODO" class="postlink">cpow's burn-down list</a>

Alright I've updated the burn-down.<br /><br />I apparently need to learn how DirectSound works because the FamiTracker code uses it and creates a certain number of &quot;blocks&quot; of audio sample data depending on the buffer size you select.  It would make sense if the program got an interrupt at the end of each block, but I'm not sure that's what actually happens.  [Which is different from SDL which interrupts whenever it needs a new &quot;block&quot;].  I am working to make the equivalent variability available with SDL's sample buffer size.

You don't have to build NESICIDE...just build the projects in libs/famitracker and apps/famitracker.  For FamiTracker the only dependency [beyond the Qt libs] is SDL, I believe.
