		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The struggle is that most of the NES games uses tiny &quot;general&quot; tiles to compose the background, so they could use them over and over again (with a different palette), and I think that's almost a form of art (like on the first level of Castlevania the base of the columns inside are as good to be the shape of the fountain outside and it looks great). But my backgrounds look like exactly what they are, and I think they aren't as great.<br /><br />BTW Frankengraphics what did you &quot;expect&quot;? Do you mean the triangular pediment or the simplicity of the roofs?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the simplicity is great. There could of course be more work done to them, but you might want to save that for other things, and it looks clean as it is and the player's eyes are guided to the foreground by the increasing detail there. <br /><br />In castlevania 3 level 1, for comparison, a lot of the nametable filled with plain gray tiles than you'd notice when simply playing. It works.  <br /><br />My remark was mostly regarding the light source (assuming it's a moonlit scene). The pillars are reflecting to the right, the majority of the rooftops are reflecting to the left, just as the foreground bricks, but still some other few are reflecting to the right once again. I did a mockup in photoshop. Ok if i upload?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Besides unifying the source/direction of light, i also mirrored the orientation of windows to reflect and support the different angles on the buildings, which would take a few more tiles. As always, feel free to use or improve on any of the alterations. EDIT: One thing that could help the perspective some more would be if the pillars in the far end on the short sides of the houses were less lit up. It would also help the scenery composition additionally as a whole to be percieved as intangible backdrop; but once again at the cost of at least new metatiles,and if you can't find a way to reuse tiles, also those.

A unified diagonal line might be worth returning to, while keeping ther distinct-ness.
