You could always just animate the player by updating vram and nothing else, but then you wouldn't be able to store that much animation. Another thing that stinks about vram (on the SNES, at least) is that you can't update much every frame, only about 2.5 64x64 sprites due to bandwidth restrictions. I would much rather be able to change character positions for sprites than finding empty space in vram, uploading it, and then changing the character bits anyway.

It doesn't seem to work that way, though. At the beginning of the ROM I see:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">4E 45 53 1A 01 01 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 78 D8 A2 40 8E 17 40 A2 FF 9A E8 8E 00 20 8E 01 20 8E 10 40 20 3B C0 A9 00 95 00 9D 00 01 9D 00 02 9D 00 04 9D 00 05 9D 00 06 9D 00 07 A9 FE 9D 00 03 E8 D0 E2 20 3B C0 4C 38 C0 2C 02 20 10 FB</div><br /><br />Basically the ines header along with all my .org'ed code. And when I go to what's presumably $fffa (the end of the file,) I see stuff I had put there too, but at a very different location than $fffa.<br /><br /><br />In general, I don't really understand this. Is it just a NES-specific thing that asm6 simply works with? Or am I going insane?<br /><br /><br /><br />Edit: later on you'll find I figured this out, but I'll post on this one what I didn't get.<br /><br />In WLA, .org means to go to this point in ROM, minus the slot. With asm6 the first .org just does the equivalent of setting the slot in WLA. The location of the code output is the same.

There's more than enough background memory for the whole screen even in 8bpp mode, so long as not everything moves every frame.

A mapper circuit on the cartridge controls the CHR ROM's upper address lines based on values selected by the CPU.<br /><br />For example, the FME-7, a mapper chip used in later Sunsoft games, divides CHR ROM into 1024 byte banks, and it divides the pattern table address space into 1024-byte windows ($0000-$03FF, $0400-$07FF, ..., $1C00-$1FFF). The mapper lets the CPU select a bank of ROM for each window. When the PPU reads the pattern table, looks at PPU A12-A10 to see which window is being read, and it looks up the appropriate bank number to output on CHR ROM A17-A10.<br /><br />Example with actual numbers: FME-7 register 5 is the CHR ROM bank number for PPU $1400-$17FF. Bank 19 of CHR ROM is $04C00-$04FFF. The CPU writes a value of 19 to register 5. Then whenever the mapper detects that the PPU is accessing $1400-$17FF (PPU A13-A10 = 0101), the FME-7 outputs 19 (CHR ROM A17-A10 = 00010011), thereby redirecting the access to CHR ROM bank 19.<br /><br />PRG ROM in excess of 32 KiB needs to be bankswitched as well. The NES, SMS, or Game Boy CPU writes to a mapper register to control upper address lines of the PRG ROM, which makes different parts of the program appear to the CPU.

I've learned that what I had in mind wasn't possible without it running at 20fps and letterboxing it a ton. (I'd also need a good expansion chip for plotting the pixels.) I wouldn't mid the SNES's capabilities if it had more overdraw. I've never been pleased with BG 3 either, but I have to understand that it's a console that was released in 1990/1991 and was developed in 1986.
