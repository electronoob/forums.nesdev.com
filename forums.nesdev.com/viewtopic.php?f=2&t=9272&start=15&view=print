Anyway, it's not possible to use macro-local labels, because they are not visible from one macro to another. And even then, I have a feeling that they'll invalidate the local @ labels too, because under the hood CA65 is simply replacing their name with a unique identifier.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />After adding some .proc/.endproc directives, I guess the lack of local labels ain't that bad. The constructs do make my AI code and my in-game mapeditor code look a bit more readable, and this is exactly the place where I'd like to have some more readability and no having to think twice over what I'm writing, at the cost of less efficient code. (was considering doing all AI in Atalan, but it turned out to be too buggy so using these macros is a less drastic alternative)<br /><br />Not sure about them in the rest of my game engine though, as I kind of want to keep my branches optimal there, and having to start thinking about what kind of branches the conditional constructs result in kind of defeats their purpose <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

The conditions will always assemble into one branch instruction except for <strong>greater</strong> / <strong>not greater</strong> so there should be no optimizing issues. (Greater should be substituted with greaterORequal where possible by comparing to a value+1)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just had a hard-to-track down bug and realized that it again was due to label restrictions... it seems that introducing any sort of scoped labels in your file prevents you from using it. So this dummy example will fail to compile:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.SETCPU &quot;6502X&quot;<br />.include &quot;hla.inc&quot;<br /><br />.CODE<br />if equal<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $00<br />endif<br /><br />.proc MyProc<br />if equal<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr $0000<br />endif<br />.endproc<br /></div><br /><br />But removing the if/endif which is outside the proc compiles fine. In this case, the two scopes are completely separate and don't interact in any way... so shouldn't it be possible to work around the label restriction here somehow, short of putting them into separate .asm files and compiling them separately? i.e, by somehow resetting the label counter before declaring MyProc, putting things in the same state as they are when you begin assembly?..

I am a bit confused as to exactly the details of the issue (just looked at it for a couple minutes), but I think I could resolve the problem if this is something you need to be able to do, let me know if you really require this. - I'm probably going to play with it anyway...<br /><br />EDIT: So I decided to change the code to work in that situation, I like it better - the problem was the way the macros were using the variable 'constants' for tracking numbers. I pasted the code at the blog link: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mynesdev.blogspot.ca/2012/09/ca65-highlevel-macros.html">http://mynesdev.blogspot.ca/2012/09/ca6 ... acros.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />But really it's probably better to keep your code inside a .proc<br /><br />Oh, btw - I added an option to create a long jump in the IF macro which is in that code -  I'm pretty sure it is working properly.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

Everything that failed prevously seems to work nicely now <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Btw, can I come with one more improvement suggestion?... I saw on the previous page of this thread a discussion of comparing numbers as &quot;greater/less&quot; with respet to signed/unsigned numbers. The thing is that to handle this decently, you probably need to have distinct namings for this similar to what the x86 assembly instructions have:<br /><a href="http://unixwiz.net/techtips/x86-jumps.html" class="postlink">http://unixwiz.net/techtips/x86-jumps.html</a><br /><br />In summary, when using unsigned numbers the x86 assembly instructions use the &quot;above&quot;/&quot;below&quot; terminology, but when the numbers are signed it uses the &quot;greater than&quot;/&quot;less than&quot; terminology. It really doesn't take very long to get used to which is appropriate for unsigned/signed numbers, so I would recommend having some similar naming in your macro pack to be able to easily do both signed and unsigned comparison.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I swore I wasn't going to do this, but I've done a lot of work to make the ability to call another macro quite a bit more useful. From a user (of this macro pack) perspective, all you need to do is make a .macro &quot;function&quot; like this example:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br />.macro padpressed buttons<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda _pads_new_pressed<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;and #(buttons)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;set_flag_test Z clear<br /><br />.endmacro<br /><br /></div><br /><br />So if you use any of the conditional macros, you can code like:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br />if padpressed BUTTON_A<br />; do stuff<br />endif<br /><br /></div><br /><br />The difference here is that the macro function can specify what CPU flags to check and there is no inline function like before.<br /><br />This allows for quite a bit of flexibility and I have both a signed and unsigned expression evaluation working that I'll post soon. Example:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br />if comp a &gt; #3<br />;code<br />endif<br /><br /></div><br /><br />Or signed:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br />if scomp a &lt;= #(&lt; -120)<br />;...<br />endif<br /><br /></div><br /><br /><br />The signed compare generates a bit of code and trashes reg a, but both can handle any comparison except for comparing registers to each other.<br /><br />EDIT: () Brackets will be needed around any high/low byte operators

As it is, none of these generate a lot of code - the signed comparison generates the most. If more complicated expressions were wanted they would have to result in more complex code being output. Interesting that MASM has support for this kind of thing.<br /><br />EDIT: <s>Actually there is a pretty bad error in the code highlevel.h due to a search and replace doing more than I expected, I&#39;ll update this post when it is fixed..</s> Fixed, links still valid.
