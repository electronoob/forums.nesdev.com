		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have the usb copynes
<br />installed it
<br />
<br />I can play games with it not plugged in to usb.
<br />I launch the software and I can grab NES info, which returns the usbcopynes string.
<br />I had the bank watch working and dumped some data that way
<br />
<br />nothing else works
<br />i try "play Cart" and nothing happens, I try to dump carts and it just hangs.
<br />
<br />I took the nes apart, made a complete project board, ran wiring from the usb copynes board to the nes (40 wires) and does the same thing.
<br />
<br />I've checked all connections with a multimeter, the lockout chip I have a switch ran to and it is bypassed when toggled, I've re-soldered connections, everything checks out.
<br />
<br />I have a large box of bootleg carts i want to dump and I cant even get the thing to dump donkey kong classics.
<br />
<br />Question #1: Is it possible that something is wrong with the board, can i re-lfash the roms on it, or test it in some way? 
<br />
<br />Question #2: Can you use different NES CPU's between toaster models? I can't be 100% sure that this is the original CPU but I do know it is from a toaster model and games play fine. Is there a preferred CPU for usbcopynes?
<br />
<br />thanks

<br />
<br />#2 yes the CPU's are interchangeable 
<br />
<br />if you're not using Windows XP  you need to download new drivers
<br />
<br />try clicking play cart and keeping the "click ok" alert open.. the system should run as if the USB isn't plugged in
<br />
<br />if the game isn't working power off (with the click ok alert still open)
<br />remove and reinsert the game and power it back on
<br />
<br />did you replace the capacitor on  the NES's board? I don't think it's supplied anymore but you need a 1uf 50v capacitor to lengthen the reset
<br />
<br />anyway hope that helps

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1: Yes, anything is possible.  But, I always try to rule out the easy/dumb stuff first.  Have you tried different USB ports on your PC, for example (not sure why, but I had a few things that don't work right on my PC's front USB ports while others were fine).  I doubt that the ROM failed - possible, but I don't think you would get the CopyNES ID string and bankwatch to work at all.  The problem also could be with the 6522 or USB circuit, or anywhere..  From what I understand, at least with the original LPT CopyNES, running the NES without the port plugged in is the same thing as selecting 'play mode'.  So I don't get why it doesn't work (I'm not the expert on this though).
<br />
<br />After you've checked everything you can reasonably check, I would ask RetroUSB for help.  If it's symptomatic of something, maybe they would know the solution.  In my (brief) experience with electronic repair, actual 'bad parts' are relatively rare, but they can cause some of the weirdest errors (and not always immediately obvious ones).  I don't know how/if those kits are tested, but it's always possible for a bad part to slip through if it's not tested (burn-in test is always good), especially if these are pulled parts from Jameco or somewhere.

<br />3.6V zener diodes on the signal lines could help

<br />
<br />I' doing an install of one for a friend, and the cap wasn't included. It's a damned good thing I both remembered it and had them on hand. I don't think it need be 50V though! 1uF at 6.3V should be more than enough. I may have used a 50V, as I had them handy, but I doubt there would be any reason to need that high of a rating.
<br />
<br />Additionally, the correct mezzanine pin strips weren't included either! There was a cheap-o press-pin socket that doesn't fit the header pins on the CopyNES (which just pops out of the socket, instantly). I have to order more female pin strips to complete the installation. That, or file down the pins, which I'd rather not have to do. Sigh.
<br />
<br />I also plan to set it up for him so that W/E will be on a selectable EXP pin, instead of hardwired to EXP0. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />had the same trouble.. if you look at the edge of the expansion port
<br />a metal tab sticks out just enough to stop the PCB

<br />
<br />I'll look for it and see what I can do I foresee problems in posting it cross-county though with the included socket even if I do get it to fit. If it's solid and won't prevent use of the EDP socket I can work wtth that, but I don't know if it will survive UPS knocking it about for a week.
<br />
<br />It's just penny-pinching, IMO. there is no reason not to include the proper female pin-strips and they're the only proper way to secure it, unless I file down the pins, as it won't fit into machine-pin (round-hole) sockets either. An extra 50 cents in parts would rectify this problem. I don't see how nobody else has complained about it...
