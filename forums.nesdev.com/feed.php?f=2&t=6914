With Flash memory it's also possible to modify data without having to erase the Flash each time. This is achieved by representing the data in a way that changes only involve clearing bits. A simple approach is to store the byte or word value at the beginning of a 256-byte page. If it needs to be changed, store a zero over it and put the new value just after it. This assumes the value 0 can be used as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_value" class="postlink">sentinel value</a>.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Mon Aug 30, 2010 7:40 pm</p><hr />

The correct answer moves the player ahead in the chain. The correct answer won't be displayed upon the giving of a wrong answer, so the player can keep guessing. The player gets 3 tries in each chain. If all 3 tries are used up, the player cannot go further with the chain &amp; the results are put in the player's career stats.<br /><br />If you all have any further suggestions, let me know. You all sound very tech-savvy. &amp; tepples, I don't have any knowledge of programming, so you can let me know what the NES is capable of when it comes how many questions, answers, &amp; overall information it can handle. Whatever it takes to get on a cartridge and still look presentable, I could easily whittle down the # of questions I make for the game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4551">Timmy112384</a> — Mon Aug 30, 2010 4:49 pm</p><hr />

The gimmick: The correct answer determines the next question's category.<br /><br />The tech specs: The scrolling effect you describe would be easiest to achieve with a horizontally arranged nametable, which implies vertical mirroring. For a text-heavy game, we're probably going to want a CHR RAM cartridge so that we can <a href="http://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=Proportional_font" class="postlink">make the text look nice and easy to read</a>. Depending on the memory size, this means UNROM/SGROM (128 KB), UOROM/SGROM (256 KB), or SUROM/modded SGROM (512 KB).<br /><br />The memory size: You want to pack 3,000 questions and sets of four answers in an NES Game Pak. How many characters do you expect each question and answer to be, on average?

Well, I'm hoping to be done with the questions in about 3 &amp; 1/2 to 4 months, and with this format for the game, I'm now planning on having a lot more questions than I did originally. The range will now be from 3,000-3,500 questions so there will be a lot of variety and it won't repeat for a while.<br /><br />After I get all the questions &amp; answers to the programmer, I would like it all to be done in another 3-6 months. Overall, I'd like the game to be completed in 10 months to a year from now<br /><br />New info regarding the game: <br />* I've narrowed the name of the game down to two choices: "The Trivia Link" &amp; "Trivia Connected" (the front-runner to me). <br />* With each trivia chain, I'd like each question to be presented in this way: Questions &amp; the four multiple choices in a box. Starting with question 1, there will be a line on the right side of the box going off the screen. If it is answered correctly, the screen will pan to the next question. So the gimmick is that whether you're playing the 10, 20, or 30 question link, all the questions will be visually connected (with only one question displayed on the screen at a time), with the final one connected to nothing at the right.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4551">Timmy112384</a> — Mon Aug 30, 2010 3:20 pm</p><hr />

On "average, "answer 5 questions in a row right &amp; you get 1 "skip it," answer 10 in a row &amp; you get 2. On "WTH?!?," answer 10 questions in a row right &amp; you get 1, answer 15 and you get 2.<br /><br />In each mode, you get 3 "do-overs" to complete the chain. If you get it wrong, you are informed it's the wrong answer &amp; not told which one is correct. You lose a "do-over" when you miss a question. If possible, I would like the game to track stats, like questions answered correctly &amp; so on.<br /><br />I don't know if I want the questions to be timed or not yet.<br /><br />If anyone is interested in making this idea into a game, just let me know.

Larry Flynt<br /><br />Extra Fact: Other recipients of the key include actor James Earl Jones and former NFL star Jerome Bettis.<br /><br />As seen in the example, I would also include an extra fact from time to time. I would make several chains so they would not repeat. The questions go from easy to hard as the chain goes on. <br /><br />So far, here are some of the rules I've come up with: In "meh" mode, if you get 3 questions in a row right, you receive 2 "skip its," meaning you can skip any question entirely if you don't know it (every question except the final one in the chain). On "average, "answer 5 questions in a row right &amp; you get 1 "skip it," answer 10 in a row &amp; you get 2. On "WTH?!?," answer 10 questions in a row right &amp; you get 1, answer 15 and you get 2.<br /><br />In each mode, you get 3 "do-overs" to complete the chain. If you get it wrong, you are informed it's the wrong answer &amp; not told which one is correct. You lose a "do-over" when you miss a question. If possible, I would like the game to track stats, like questions answered correctly &amp; so on.<br /><br />I don't know if I want the questions to be timed or not yet.<br /><br />If anyone is interested in making this idea into a game, just let me know. Advice &amp; criticism is welcomed.<br /><br />Thanks!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4551">Timmy112384</a> — Sun Aug 29, 2010 8:29 pm</p><hr />
