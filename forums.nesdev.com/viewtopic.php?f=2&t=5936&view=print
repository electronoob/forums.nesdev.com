		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've got three color-related questions about the NES and I think, since you program for the NES, you maybe can answer them.
<br />
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Question 1:</span>
<br />Please have a look at these two pictures:
<br /><img src="http://i46.tinypic.com/21nm64h.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="http://i47.tinypic.com/j5f4fb.png" alt="Image" />
<br />They were made with FCE Ultra. The second image is the one where the option "NTSC Color Emulation" is enabled. I live in Germany, so I have PAL. And on my TV screen, "Super Mario Bros." looks like the first image. So far so good. The strange thing now is: Once, I asked Americans which image comes closer to the game on a real NES and all said that it's the first one. Same with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmVQKvUEPw" class="postlink">this American commercial</a> where the "Super Mario Bros." background clearly looks blue and not purple.
<br />So, my question: What's the deal with that NTSC color emulation? Obviously, in reality, the game on a real NES looks like the first picture, no matter if it's shown on a PAL or an NTSC screen. So, why is this specific "NTSC palette" actually there? And where does it come from?
<br />
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Question 2:</span>
<br />O.k., this is basically the NES palette:
<br /><img src="http://i49.tinypic.com/spye1c.png" alt="Image" />
<br />Now, when I make a screenshot with FCE Ultra and inspect its color palette (256 color PNG), then it looks like that:
<br /><img src="http://i47.tinypic.com/25kk39x.png" alt="Image" />
<br />The NES palette is in the upper part of the lower half. But I always wondered what the lower colors (the last four rows) are for. Then I found out:
<br /><img src="http://i48.tinypic.com/1z65s80.png" alt="Image" />
<br />"Dragon's Lair" uses them.
<br />My question: How is that done on a real NES? How can "Dragon's Lair" use other colors than the ones of the regular NES palette? I mean, with an emulator, that's no problem. But how did they achieve that on a real NES?
<br />Additional question: Does anybody know what these colors at the top of the screenshoot palette (light yellow, gray, red, green and blue) are good for? Are they just for any FCE Ultra's on-screen information or are they used in games?
<br />
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Question 3:</span>
<br />Again the NES palette:
<br /><img src="http://i49.tinypic.com/spye1c.png" alt="Image" />
<br />These two gray colors on the right side: Were they ever used in a commercial game?
<br />Once, I did the following: I shot a bunch of screenshots of different games and then I looked if there is a color that was never used. I found out that all colors are in use in one game or another. It took me a while, but I finally found an appearance of every single color from the palette. Except for the two gray colors on the right. Besides being almost indistinguishable from the other two grays:
<br /><img src="http://i49.tinypic.com/9iqlxz.png" alt="Image" />
<br />they are never used. Whenever a game uses gray, it always takes the two left ones, never the right ones. So, do you know of a game that actually uses them?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Before I even say anything, let me just tell you that FCE Ultra is a pretty old emulator already, and a lot of stuff has been discovered/invented after it's been abandoned, so it's not the best one to use as reference.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">JohnJohn wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">So, my question: What's the deal with that NTSC color emulation?</div><br />A lot of consoles generate RGB video, and since computers also use that color model it's easy to get the colors right. The NES, however, uses a hue based scheme that's hard to get right in RGB. A few years back people noticed a certain logic in the palette and made palette simulators, but they obviously didn't get it right, as we can see in the screenshot. <br /><br />More recently, Blargg made a great breakthrough regarding NES video: he developed a library that actually simulates the generation of the analog video signal the console does, so the result is pretty damn accurate, not only the color, but everything else looks terribly similar to a what you see on a real TV. If you haven't seen it already, you can see it in Nestopia (you have to activate it), a very good and up to date emulator. A few other emulators also have it.<br /><br />But even then, each TV is different, and is calibrated differently (When you go to a TV store and there are a bunch of them lined up showing the same video you can easily see that the colors vary a lot from one TV to the other - much less with HDTVs and digital video, but still), and PC monitors are also all calibrated differently, so you can never have an emulator output colors that are 100% right, because there isn't such a thing.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">How is that done on a real NES?</div><br />The NES has a configuration called "color emphasis". There are 3 bits you can mess with that shift the whole palette towards red, green or blue, or combinations of those colors. But in reality emphasizing one color is actually de-emphasizing the other 2, so when you try to emphasize all 3 at the same time the whole palette becomes darker. I don't remember if FCEU emulates the individual emphasized colors, but since these palettes are not in the image you posted I guess it doesn't.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Are they just for any FCE Ultra's on-screen information</div><br />Yup. It's for texts like "state saved", "slot 0 selected", things like that.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">These two gray colors on the right side: Were they ever used in a commercial game?</div>
<br />I can't say for sure that they weren't, but they were avoided (Nintendo probably advised developers against using them) because not all versions of the PPU had those colors, a few special versions of the PPU that output RGB video (never used in regular NES consoles) had just black there, so if games used those grays they'd look wrong in systems that used this different PPU.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I just checked FCEUXD, and it does emulate the emphasis bits. Here's a screen from Noah's Ark:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img532.imageshack.us/img532/839/95994454.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />At the bottom of the screen, blue emphasis is used along with monochrome mode to simulate the water.
<br />
<br />Here's the palette from that image:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/3301/paletten.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />The bottom palette is the one shifted towards blue. I don't know why there are 2 copies of the basic palette at the top.

<br />Almost all emulators do not take screenshots that way, since the NES can have the palette reassigned multiple times within a frame.  Nesticle doesn't even emulate that.  But it is the only emulator that takes screenshots which preserve the original color indexes, despite its horrible NES palette.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The NES generates its palette by generating a wave for each pixel, which NTSC televisions interpret as hue (from phase), luminance (from a DC offset), and saturation (from amplitude of the wave).
<br />
<br />As I understand it, the NES creates this wave by alternating between the two sets of grays.
<br />
<br />For example, to create the color $11, the nes outputs xxxxxxyyyyyy, where x is the gray at $01, and y is the gray at $d1. This makes a square wave.
<br />
<br />xxxxxxyyyyyy is color $1x, yxxxxxxyyyyy is $2x (or is it $cx?), yyxxxxxxyyyy being the next color after that, etc etc.
<br />
<br />Those grays aren't waves though, they're just plain flat voltages. However, by alternating between those two flat voltages, that's how the wave is created, and like I said, $0x is one peak, and $dx is the other peak.

But to me that's more an issue related to customizable palettes and setting the tint. But why are there two different default palettes? The so-called NTSC palette could be an alternative loadable palette. But it isn't. It's a completely distinct feature to enable the "NTSC palette", independently from loading palette files. So why is this the case? If the NTSC palette is supposed to be more accurate (which it isn't) why isn't it the default? The emulators all have a default palette. Then they have the ability to load custom palettes. Why is there that completely different third option of enabling an "NTSC palette"?<br /><br />The stuff with being able to darken the colors was new to me.

<br />Yes, the light one. Now I have seen every single color used in one game or another. Except for...Well, let's have a look at the palette again:
<br /><img src="http://i49.tinypic.com/spye1c.png" alt="Image" />
<br />As you can see, on the right side are the two not-to-be-used-but-still-used-now-and-then gray colors and two times black. But now look at the palette when "NTSC color emulation" is turned on:
<br /><img src="http://i50.tinypic.com/k1tp2r.png" alt="Image" />
<br />Now there is a third, even darker gray that's not visible when the default palette is turned on. Is this gray used anywhere?
<br />
<br />By the way, do you have any idea why they have two whites instead of white and another gray?

<br />
<br />Check out <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=2113" class="postlink">this post</a> by Kevtris.  It explains how the hues of the NES are generated by cycling the voltage between the two extremes (colours x0 and xD).  Kev's doc was eye-opening, and explained a few things that I'd always suspected.
<br />
<br />Anyway, the designers of the NES/FC PPU had to step up the luminance and saturation <em>together</em> in only 6 steps (black, white, plus 4 intermediary levels for the hues) so they chose those x0 and xD levels for this purpose (even if it means two repeated whites.)

I don't know which type of PPU came first, the one with the grays or the one without them, but maybe there was some hardware constraint that prevented them from reproducing the same colors on that different PPU, or maybe the grays aren't even intentional, being just a side effect of picking those specific color indexes. Well, like I said, I don't have an answer for that, I simply avoid those colors.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Now there is a third, even darker gray that's not visible when the default palette is turned on.

Some of these illegal colors can even confuse some televisions, which interpret them as syncing signals and such instead of as colors.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">By the way, do you have any idea why they have two whites instead of white and another gray?</div>
<br />I wish there was another gray. I wish the NES palette would make more sense, but it is what it is. In my recent programs I have rearranged the palette a bit (using look-up tables), to make it more friendly to my fading routines.

<br />This is true. You should also understand that different human eyes sees colors slightly differently, and that a colors can appear different to the brain depending on the colors arround it.
<br />For example, light yellow will look light yellow if surrounded by white, but will look white if surrounded by black - there is a million of other examples.
<br />
<br />Tokumaru is right about scrolling to affect colors. This can be seen in a few places - if one pixel in the background is significantly different than the ones surrounding it it will seem to flicker as it scroll, because of the color filter on the TV screen (can be seen on the eyes on the statues at the begining of Castelvania) - maybe this is a PAL only trick or somehting specific to my TV tough.

<br />
<br />Forever and ever and ever and ever ago, we had trouble producing clock sources that would reliably maintain the exact frequency needed to recover color from the combined signal that's sent over the air. This frequency drift would cause the hue to shift as you went from left to right on the screen.
<br />
<br />The PAL workaround (after having seen/predicted the problems with NTSC) was to make every other line's color information backwards (hence Phase Alternating Line) so that, even though they couldn't fix the clock issue, they could at least guarantee the symptom would be losing saturation of color rather than incorrect hue.
<br />
<br />Nowadays? Technology made up for that weakness.
<br />
<br />Specifically in the case of the NES, a PAL machine gives you an extra 70 scanlines' time to redraw the screen, which is nice.

<br />Unless it's a PAL/M machine from Brazil, which is more like an NTSC machine because it uses a daughterboard to convert NTSC to PAL/M.
<br />
<br />The disadvantage of regular PAL is flicker. Lots of flicker. I can't see flicker at 60 Hz but I can see it at 50 Hz. The other disadvantage, in the case of the NES, is more visible artifacts at the top and bottom in certain mirroring modes.

<br />Also true. The extra VBlank time is nice, but the problems mentioned above are just too annoying. Also, making use of the extra VBlank time breaks compatibility with NTSC consoles, meaning that these "NES programs" are not compatible with a great portion of NES consoles.

<br />
<br />I've convinced myself (but I have no idea if this is right) that the tremendously huger market for NTSC sets meant that only CRTs with phosphors meant to be refreshed at 60Hz were findable -- and Europe simply wasn't a big enough market to legitimize research into finding good slower green and blue phosphors.
