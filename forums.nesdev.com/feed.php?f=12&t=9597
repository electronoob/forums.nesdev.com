The final font bitmap (with the chessboard pattern and duplicated chars removed):<br />MB90082_final_font.gif<br />In case somebody should be interested, here's the conversion tool with source code: Mb90082_tool.zip (it does require the above &quot;MB90082_screenshot.png&quot; file saved as 24bpp 5,005,966-byte bitmap named &quot;MB90082_original_screenshot.bmp&quot; as input file).<br /><br />And finally, the plain font as binary file: Mb90082.zip containing the MB90082.BIN file for use in no$sns BIOS folder (works with the currently released no$sns version) (ie. no$sns v1.4 was ready to support the font once when it gets dumped) (though the emulator's font resizing doesn't look too well, maybe I'll add some cosmetic fixes on that part in next no$sns versions).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5211">nocash</a> — Fri Mar 08, 2013 3:19 pm</p><hr />

Here comes the SFC-Box OSD charset.<br />Mark has got hold of a video grabber which gives pretty much perfect screenshots of the charset:<br />MB90082_screenshot.png<br />Here's the same picture with a red pixel grid:<br />MB90082_gridded.png<br />For extracting the &quot;raw&quot; pixels, I've been writing a tool that computes the average pixel color (within the above grid). If it's a clearly black or clearly white pixel then it's takes as is. If it's an unclear &quot;gray&quot; pixel, then the tool is examining the left and right pixels, and adjusts the intensity of the middle pixel to the opposite of the intensity of those left/right pixels, and does then retry to identify the adjusted pixel. The result looks like so:<br />MB90082_pixelized.gif<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5211">nocash</a> — Fri Mar 08, 2013 3:03 pm</p><hr />

Mark has been running my &quot;kromtest&quot; program (ie. replaced the KROM bios chip on the SFC-Box mainboard by the kromtest EPROM)!<br />21 screenshots showing the kromtest v1.0 results can be found here: kromtest10.zip (aside from the screenshots, the original test program v1.0 is also included for reference).<br /><br />The cpu tests are showing invalid opcode traps, &quot;-&quot;=passed, &quot;0&quot;=trapped with UFO=0, &quot;.&quot;=skipped/not tested. The interesting part is that the HD64180 is actually trapping all undocumented opcodes, even those that are more or less commonly used on Z80 CPUs, ie. the HD64180 doesn't support accessing IX/IY 16bit registers as 8bit fragments (IXH,IXL,IYH,IYL), doesn't support &quot;SLL&quot; opcode, nor useless opcode mirrors (like alternate NEG/IM/RETN/RETI/NOP mirrors).<br />Please ignore the &quot;DDCBxx&quot; test page, it's rather meaningless; I wanted to test DDCBNNxx, not DDCBxx, but I got that wrong :-)<br /><br />The TEST &quot;VBLANK&quot; TIME test... I've no clue what the results mean. It was intended to measure timings of a bit that was assumed to be a VBLANK (or maybe VSYNC) signal, but somehow the timings don't seem to match either one...<br />For a 60Hz signal I would have expected 8 times bigger values (although the HD64180 waitstates and refresh cycles might slowdown the CPU, but even then the values should be around 4 times bigger as they are). And transformed to 262 total scanlines, the &quot;duty&quot; would be around 10 scanlines, which also doesn't match typical vblank or vsync periods.<br /><br />The WATCHDOG is trapping in both cases (when leaving the watchdog bit stuck set to &quot;1&quot;, or stuck set to &quot;0&quot;). Meaning that... watchdog reset should occur either on 1-to-0 or 0-to-1 transitions (or both)... or on repeated writes without transitions. That isn't quite clear yet, anyways it's confirmed that the bit is really having a watchdog function.<br />The 00000ABAh value gives some hint on the timeout, but it's also affected by memory waitstates and refresh cycles, so it'd be a bit difficult to convert that value to an actual &quot;time&quot; value counted in cycles or seconds.<br /><br />OSD Tests are showing the full charset, the resolution isn't yet good enough for dumping it, but at least one can see japanese characters, special volume/tape/am/pm/no/arrow symbols, and the normal ASCII characters (which lack some chars like &quot;@|\&quot;).<br />Char Sizes test reveals which bits do control horizontal and vertical zoom. Also note that, after vertical zoom, the next line is skipped, eg. after zoom in Line 3, next line is Line 5 (and Line 4 isn't displayed).<br />The Special Styles screen reveals a blink-feature, the abitlity to use the &quot;unknown color&quot; as per-character background color, and some complicated bit-combinations that do enable using the &quot;background color&quot; either as &quot;outline&quot; or as &quot;solid&quot; background.<br />The blink interval isn't visible in the screenshots (obviously), but it can be seen in the original test video <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDwZ62e1FdQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDwZ62e1FdQ</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Next kromtest version will include a higher resoltion font-viewer with chars drawn on a chessboard pattern. The missing DDCBNNxx opcode trap test, and verification of (un-)expected traps.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5211">nocash</a> — Mon Dec 10, 2012 6:15 am</p><hr />
