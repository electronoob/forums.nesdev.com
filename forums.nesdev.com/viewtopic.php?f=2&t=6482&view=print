<br />Kirby writes two identical copies of the visible map to VRAM, and then once the camera has risen entirely into the top copy, it switches to the bottom copy to ascend further.
<br />
<br />Crystalis and Gauntlet II use an MMC3 interrupt to rewrite scroll to skip the status bar.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There are a few ways to implement this.
<br />
<br />A common solution is to use single screen mirroring, so that one screen is used for the level map and the other for the status bar. The only problem is that there will be horizontal scrolling glitches at the sides of the screen (but this already happens with popular games such as SMB3 and <em>Kirby's Adventure</em>). You can hide such glitches though, with the trick used in <em>Felix the Cat</em> and <em>Alfred Chicken</em> (using a column of 8x16 sprites to cover the right side of the screen).
<br />
<br />The other option is to use IRQs to skip over the status bar, like <em>Crystalis</em> does. I'm not a big fan of this solution, because it requires a mapper with IRQs.

<br />It uses single screen mirroring. One of the name tables is used for gameplay, and the other for the status bar (which is selected when rendering reaches the bottom part of the screen).
<br />
<br />But if you didn't mind a few empty scanlines at the top of the status bar you sure could draw it wherever you wanted every frame.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd strongly recommend using single screen mirroring.
<br />
<br />Though if you ABSOLUTELY want to use a mapper that don't allow it, there is 2 way to do it :
<br />- Keep two copies of the playfield (Kirby's Adventure, Gargoyle's Quest). Only works if the size of your status bar is constant
<br />- Keep relocating the status bar as you scroll vertically (Conquest of the Crystal Palace, Radia Senki, Double Dragon series, Gradius II, Jungle Book).
<br />
<br />Then it is also possible to do it like Cristallis or Krusty's fun house, which uses an IRQ to simulate one-screen mirroring. I personally would recommand that only at a very last ressort : (if my memory is good) if you have scanline IRQs, then you have either a one-screen mirroring capable mapper, or the MMC3, which becomes capable to do 1-screen mirroring if you turn it into mapper 118 TLSROM/TKSROM.
<br />So only do that if you have prolems by the first 2 methods (for example if the extra VRAM transfers when scrolling is a real problem or if you change the size of your status bar (or hide it completely) during gameplay). In my opinion the overhead of having an extra IRQ at a VARIABLE scanline is the most annoying, especially when that IRQ comes close to a screen borer or the status bar. It probably kills the possibility of any other scan-line effect you could do during gameplay.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The most common way I see this done is by mirroring your writes to both nametables, while using horizontal mirroring. On the bottom-most nametable, you write your status bar, and then you just be sure not to overwrite it when you mirror your nametable updates.
<br />
<br />Then, using an IRQ (like with MMC3), you split the screen to display the status bar.
<br />
<br />The reason this works is because you'll be simulating single-screen mirroring, and your IRQ (which displays your status bar) will cover up the part of the nametable where the statusbar would scroll onscreen, should you scroll low enough.
<br />
<br />If you want some "true" single-screen mirroring, I think MMC1 accomplishes this (one nametable will be your playfield, and the other nametable is the status bar). You just simply keep the status bar at the top of the screen, and use sprite #0 to split the screen to the playfield.

<br />Crystalis reset the offset to (0, X) when the screen reaches (30, X) manually to simulate 1-screen mirroring, but then it have to do it at ANY screen position.

<br />Like it's been said, it's possible to redefine the scroll to any position you want midframe if you use some $2006/$2005 trickery (as explained in Loopy's scrolling doc).
<br />
<br />Crystalis uses horizontal mirroring, meaning that the name tables are arranged one on top of the other, forming a 256x480-pixel map. However it uses the top name table for the map, and the bottom one for the status bar (like a game using single-screen mirroring would).
<br />
<br />But since mirroring is set to horizontal, when the end of the name table with the map is reached during rendering the name table with the status bar would be displayed next, so the game sets up an IRQ for the scanline where this happens and resets the scroll back to the top of the screen at that point, forcing a scroll wrap (that would happen naturally with single-screen mirroring).
<br />
<br />So yeah, it's basically simulating 1-screen mirroring. If you are just starting your project and haven't picked a mapper yet, I suggest you use a simple one that supports 1-screen mirroring (like AxROM), unless you absolutely need the other functions of mappers like the MMC3, such as CHR bankswitching, IRQs for purposes other than simulating 1-screen mirroring, and so on.
