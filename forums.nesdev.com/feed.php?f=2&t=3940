The tar.gz format uses solid archiving, but it still has Deflate's 32 KiB window, which is smaller than everything but the earliest NROM games. The only widely-used Free archive format I know of that has solid archiving and a window size on the same order of magnitude as an NES ROM is .7z used by 7-Zip.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Mar 02, 2008 7:45 am</p><hr />

Just FYI, my dumping client does have the ability to fix ROM images, but it will only work with images known by the DB. Although, because it's doing everything online, it's not very practical to do batch operations.<br /><br />I am planning on making a standalone utility that can load up the XML either from Nestopia or one generated by the cart database in order to easily and efficiently repair and convert between formats.<br /><br />I'm not sure where this talk of replacing iNES came from, I can't speak for Marty, but I don't know that this format is aimed at replacing anything. My client and upcoming utility will be able to convert images into whatever format you want, your not going to be forced to convert to the XML based one.<br /><br />Just a few comments on some points brought up:<br /><br />Writing an XML parser is a pain. It certainly is, but luckily there are dozens of free libs out there that you can drop right in. I found a nice lightweight one, incorporated into a single class that allows to to easily read,create,modify,etc XML files.<br /><br />I also thought INES2 was (and still is) a great idea. If anyone is ever up to completing and documenting it (mainly the sub mapper stuff), I'll be happy to add support for that as well. It's not as flexible as the XML format, but simply the fact that it is backwards compatible makes it a huge advantage.<br /><br />Viewing ROMs in a hex editor is much easier to follow with this XML format since the ROMs are stored separately and individually, so the offsets don't get messed up.<br /><br />As far as IPS patching goes, one would think soft-patching would usually be the preferred way to go about it and Nestopia will still be able to use patches in this manner. However, there certainly are cases where you'd want to do hard patching as well. I could add this ability to the ROM utility.<br /><br />The flexibility of the XML format is quite an advantage and you can really define a lot of detail about the hardware if you want too, even though it's not always necessary.<br /><br />It already does define some pin information in cases where it is necessary. For instance to distinguish between CNROM types (m3 &amp; m185) and X1-005 (m80 &amp; m207). It also defines things like sound samples for games that have a built-in chip like the D7756C. I plan on doing this for some other boards as well, especially to deal with all the Konami VRC variants.<br /><br />Another thing I like about the new format is the ability to have ROM "sets", as in one zip can contain all the data for a game and any revisions or regional versions. Besides being more organized, it also has the bonus of being able to share ROMs, as quite often it is only the PRG ROM that changes.<br /><br />This is also the main reason my client doesn't yet build images in this format though as my db doesn't currently have any link information between regions. A lot of this data will be able to be generated automatically based on catalog ID's and shared ROMs, but there is still plenty that will have to be done by hand.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=158">BootGod</a> — Sat Mar 01, 2008 7:29 pm</p><hr />

I've been waiting forever for SOMEONE to write a database-driven ROM header fixer.  The Mac version of Nestopia doesn't support soft IPS patching, and I HATE it when I apply a translation/hack to a ROM and watch it blow up because it has a bad header and Nestopia can no longer resolve it.  A couple of years ago I wrote a small, hackish program that output to a text file the NstDatabase contents for a given .nes file, so that I could fix the header with a hex editor based on Nestopia's treatment of the ROM.  All well and good, until Nestopia was updated and some fields in the database file were changed, causing my little program to fail (ugh!!).<br /><br />The next version of Nestopia will have its database converted to the new XML format.  I love this aspect of the XML proposal, because the format is more standardized and more easily used by other software, such as a ROM fixer.  I don't care much for the zipfile container approach, but the XML database feature is very appealing to me.  If my programming skills weren't so bad (it takes me forever to do a hackish job at something), I'd write a ROM fixing utility as soon as the new Nestopia version was out.  I sincerely hope that someone - ANYONE - out there will FINALLY get a decent ROM tool developed for the NES!<br /><br />[/rant]<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=360">dvdmth</a> — Sat Mar 01, 2008 10:59 am</p><hr />

Hmm, nice to see someone (Bootgod, Martin) step up. The way I see it, this new format is meant for preservation only (iNES2 can still exist for everything else: gaming, development, romhacking). The emulator, Nestopia in this case, is used as a tool to see if the data/info extracted from the board is accurate.<br /><br />"preservationists" should be aware though that this is not the ultimate format, it's done in steps. 10 years ago we thought iNES was enough, 20 years from now, the information we have currently will probably be seen as lacking.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=115">hap</a> — Sat Mar 01, 2008 9:09 am</p><hr />

Again, I'll remember everyone that the board name tell us nothing :<br /><br />- A UNROM game can have either a 74HC32 or a 74HC08 (very uncommon), either making the high or low PRG area switched, those are different mappers, but both are UNROM. The same apply for japanese CNROM games with 8KB CHRROM<br />- A game can use a TLROM or MC-ACC board and still have exactly the same results, the differences between both boards doesn't exist and nobody will ever care to call them different.<br />- Most japanese non-Ninendo made boards have no names, or really crap names.<br /><br />Finally, XML shucks and stinks and is completley overrated (exept when it comes to do HTML and still...). Why waste about 20 bytes of thext for those &lt;stuff&gt;&lt;/stuff&gt; when the same thing could be exprimed with 2 bits ?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Feb 29, 2008 11:23 pm</p><hr />

I think the only way this would every really catch on is if there was an "export to XML from iNES" or "export to iNES from XML" application. <br /><br />The other problem is that the user DOESN'T care how the rom is stored, he just wants to play. The only people who care are developers, and unless we can make the transition seemless (which we can't because all the rom sites aren't going to just randomly change to a new format because we said so--hell we can't even decide on which format is the best), then this isn't ever going to happen.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3490">beissemj</a> — Fri Feb 29, 2008 7:13 pm</p><hr />
