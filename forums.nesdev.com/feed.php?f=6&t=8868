It would have been used on a lot check before soldering the 2A03 to the mainboard, so whatever form the test program came in, it was probably not a conventional Famicom cartridge.<br /><br />Unlike the field test cartridges, where a service tech is paying attention (and can say "oh, the sound works/doesn't"), this TST interface allows the CPU itself to say "yes, everything works". <br /><br />Revising the mask is a fairly expensive process (in terms of time), and while they could have changed the wire bonder to tie the TST land to ground internally in the chip and left the pin truly NC, that's not really any easier than soldering the pin low.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Wed May 16, 2012 10:41 am</p><hr />

For fun tonight I decided to load up all the Famicom titles from 1983 and all the test cartridge ROMs that I could find and look for read and write breaks for range $4018 through $401F.  I also browsed CaH4e3's site and TCRF to make sure that I wasn't missing any extra debug features of the games.<br /><br />I didn't get a single bite from my fishing for any of the games and test carts.<br /><br />This leads me to wonder why any of it was left in the production model...  Was Nintendo aware that Ricoh left it in?

Hardware is hardware and exploration of it can be exciting.  I believe most people have performed modifications on their NES here to play imported games; or have even designed their own hardware to work around limitations without modifying the hardware.<br /><br />I really do apologize for diverting the topic slightly, but when it comes to development or demoscening, many other "scenes" modify or expand the console or computer to add just a bit more RAM or a few more sound channels; sometimes even underclocking the processor.<br /><br />Getting back on track, it's not even as if we're installing a 20-pin modchip into the damned thing.  It is a rather child's play modification.  We're also just debating a lot of speculation of this rather undocumented feature set.  Also as time has told before there will be people that are interested in finding out how the hardware works, experimenting with it, making PoC demos, and then finally emulating the features.<br /><br />As this was probably a feature that existed before production Nintendo or Famicom hardware was made, I'm wondering if there are any early prototype cartridges that read or write to any of these registers...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3466">B00daW</a> — Thu May 10, 2012 10:58 am</p><hr />

Especially when this sort of sparse sample playback (or "piecewise linear mode" as I'll call it) can be done on an unmodified NES. Make one-byte samples of value $AA (flat), $00 (decrease), and $FF (increase). Then play individual bytes after each DMC IRQ, writing the starting value of a segment to $4011 and the address of the direction to $4012.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu May 10, 2012 5:18 am</p><hr />

The noise channel probably emits nonzero when the LFSR output is in one state and zero when the output is in the other state. Only one bit at a time is available, and it isn't very random because it depends solely on the time since the channel was reset divided by the period divider. This in turn depends on the number of CPU cycles, which is predictable. It'd be easier just to use a subroutine to simulate clocking a 16-bit LFSR eight times, like <a href="http://www.6502.org/source/integers/crc-more.html" class="postlink">Greg Cook's CRC16</a>.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu May 10, 2012 4:40 am</p><hr />

Just a crazy idea how the increased triangle control could be used: You could use it for what I would call "sparse sample playback". The new resgister would allow you to control the phase position, as well the frequency (as usual). The way this could to your advantage is by successively approximating a waveform with writes at irregular intervals. Think of it as approximating the waveform with straight line segments, where every line is given a start amplitude (phase position) and a direction (highest bit of phase position and frequency register.) <br /><br />The benefit might be reduced CPU usage, although the scheduling would be a nightmare, I imagine. I don't think this idea is practical, but I thought I'd put it out there rather than letting it rot in the back of my brain.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4548">nitro2k01</a> — Wed May 09, 2012 4:56 pm</p><hr />
