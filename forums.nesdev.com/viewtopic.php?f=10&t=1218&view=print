		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello,
<br />
<br />     I'm putting together a small rpg (MMC1) type game and I need atleast 9-10 (max)scanlines worth of my nmi for joypad, sprites, and drawing updates with windows, cursor, etc... Anyways, I wanted to add my sound driver into the program but lack the nmi time to do the update then. 
<br />
<br />    There are quite a few points in the main code were waits a performed on the screen updates mentioned, so updating the sound in the main would be kind of problem.
<br />
<br />    I was just wondering, is there another way to update sound? Anyone had this problem? Should I create a routine to use in my main loops even though there are a good number of these loops?

<br />Oh, sorry  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> .
<br />
<br />I'll make a routine that waits nmi end - update sound, and use it in my waiting loops.

<br />I, for some reason thought I might have missed an alternative.

When the screen starts its VBlank, and NMI is triggered, meaning that the processor will push it current adress, and jump to NMI vector. NMI will return when a "rti" opcode is executed. This has absolutely nothing to do with VBlank time, exept the fact that an NMI is usually triggered at the exact start of VBlank time.
<br />Now, in your NMI routine, you have to upload anything about graphics, sprites, set your scroll registers and nametable used (writes to $2003/4, $4014, $2006/7, $2005 and $2000) pretty quickly before VBlank ends to have a stable image on the screen.
<br />Then, you can do anything you want in your NMI routine, since it doesn't write to SPR-RAM nor to PPU RAM (including name tables, pattern tables, attributes tables and palettes). It will work regardless of if VBlank has finished or not yet. You can do sound in or outside your NMI routine, in function of how you like it.

<br />
<br />Thanks for that clarification.
<br />Just to satisfy my curiosity, more than one VBlank period can occur while the CPU is in the NMI routine (supposing that it took that long to reach the next rti instruction)?
<br />
<br />Also, its kind of off topic but... Does anyone get a slight screen glitch (almost a quick flicker) with Nintendulator? Alot of commercial games I've tested on it showed this behaviour even though they run smoothly on my NTSC NES. Is this something I would see on a slower PC, like mine?

<br />
<br />"NMI" time and the NMI routine are high-level concepts that don't exist in the hardware. All the NMI interrupt does is vector the CPU to a different address and save some state on the stack. Once that's complete everything carries on as normal. You can use this vectoring however you like in your code; the usual way is to do some operations then execute RTI (which itself does nothing special, just restores the status flags and returns to the address on the stack).

<br />Nope. I'm aware of that. It's more like one frame every now and then is draw skewed to the right along the vertical axis.

<br />Does this happen when you first turn on a game? You wouldn't notice this on a TV because many TVs blank the signal for a few frames while synchronizing to the NES's frequencies.
<br />
<br />Does this happen at the beginning of any screen in <em>Dr. Mario</em>? If so, I have noticed it on a real NES running through a real TV. Computer monitors are generally built better than TVs and may show the glitch more clearly.

<br />
<br />Well, the one game I noticed it happening alot in Nintendulator was Dragon Warrior 1. On the TV, I can't see the occasional glitch. The reason I was bringing this up, though, was that my own project does this as well in Nintendulator. Same exact behaviour. I wanted to know really if it was my old PC lagging behind or my program.

<br />This is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_tearing" class="postlink">tearing</a>. It occurs when the video image is being updated by software at the same time the hardware is presenting it on the output device. Almost all games suffer from it to some degree. If your monitor and nintendulator were using the same exact vsync frequency, and there was no chance of your operating system pre-emptively interrupting the program during critical times around the sync, you would not see this issue.
<br />The short of it - it's not a bug in your code.
