I'll throw together a ROM for others to test as I've not tested it that much, I've been modifying it every compile, with the first compile attempt was at about 300 lines of program...with over 30 errors! Weren't big though, just some typos, and a few because the variables were named different from what I had, only took 5 minutes to fix all 30 errors. And first compile, it actually showed a sprite! One of two, but it showed it! It didn't clear OAM too though, that bug was fixed, along with all others that I know of, and here's the final features:<br /><br />Flip on X,Y,X+Y, or no axis's.<br /><br />Not display sprites that travel to the other side of the screen.<br /><br />Be able to bring in sprites from all sides of the screen, so you can put a sprite at $F8 that's 2 sprites wide, the the F8 sprite will not display, but the 00 one will.<br /><br />Rotates OAM automatically (Up to 16 sprites on a scanline don't flicker too bad. Any more than that, though, has some processing problems where some just don't get displayed ever. Looking to fix later)<br /><br />And that's about it. As for the speed, it looks to take about 8.5 scanlines for the Boo sprite. And then about 9.5 for the Megaman. Is this good, bad, ugly for an OAM engine like this?<br /><br />The ROM below you can run this and move the sprite around the screen. (The screen wraps so you can see it come in from all locations) but there's only 1 object. Move with the D-Pad, B changes the sprite, and select+start both do flips so you can see all combinations at work.<br /><br />You can add up to 15 more &quot;objects&quot; with FCEUX hex editor to see the OAM flickering. The object memory is 16 bytes per array, with 4 data arrays in $100 to $13F. $100 is the X coord. $110 is the Y coord. $120 is the attributes (X/Y/P bits at YXP0.0000)+enabled flag (0000.000E)+on/off current base screen flag (000Y.X000). (YXPYX00E) The last array at $130 is the object value. Either 0 (Boo) or 1 (Megaman).<br /><br />Well, finally here's the goods:<br /><br />ROM:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1laUfqMuZQBSTVMOHE5c3RpQVE/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1laUfq ... sp=sharing</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Source:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1laUfqMuZQBMjJzeGJ1RmdhYzA/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1laUfq ... sp=sharing</a><!-- m --><br /><br />ANY input would be appreciated, good or bad.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'll be updating the ROM soon to include a feature to make new objects with the A button so you I can test it on my NES. But I've been thinking how to make it faster...and I think I found a way. What about just straight up decompressing to WRAM at the beginning of a level all metadata needed to WRAM? Think that's a good option? Instead of looking up index of compressed tile in ROM, you could just decompress all the tile and attribute data to WRAM, and then move it with before it's put on the screen. Seems like it'd be worth it with how many cycles it takes for 8 objects, it takes up basically half the screen time.

How do you (plan to) handle that? The best I've come up with is to have a 8th bit for the meta-sprite screen coords. This means for example that I you could imagine the screen is 512 pixels wide which results in 128 'pixels' of off-screen on either side of the actual and then clip (skip copy to OAM) if the tile to be drawn falls in that range.</div><br /><br />Did you mean a 9th bit?<br /><br />In my engine, the coordinates of the objects are 16 bits, but also the hardware sprite coordinates are calculated as 16 bit values. If the high byte is anything but 0, do not draw the sprite. So the coordinates would end up as $FFxx if they were off the left edge, and $01xx if they were off the right edge. It might seem slow to deal with 16 bit values for each coordinate, but I've optimized the math to really ignore/discard the high byte of the result. I only have to do like a BCS statement after a certain addition to see if its off screen. This will ensure every part of the metasprite that's on screen is rendered, no wrap around.<br /><br />Some people take the all or nothing approach where you draw the sprites only if the entire object is on screen. This is an okay solution for small objects, in my opinion, but looks bad for bigger ones.

And lastly, hold A and start to create a new object. Hold A and press select to delete the current object and go back 1 more.<br /><br />This way of doing things also considers the single sprite display window as 1 of 4 nametables, basically like the NES's base nametables. If it goes to any other of the &quot;screens&quot; (Aka outside the current window), those sprites aren't displayed. The high bits for those, though, will be handled by the camera system, not the metatile system. That seem okay?<br /><br />Are there any obvious features I've missed? Feedback?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think it is not bad performance wise. I'd like to think my code is pretty good, and your seems a touch faster, but I think that is your OAM rotation may be faster and probably mostly that you are using 8x16 sprites.<br /><br />This seems to help with speed, since megaman is 7 sprites, where in my code it megaman is 10. I might consider switching to 8x16 but it can (and here with megaman, it does) leave holes in the pattern table. As well, your clipping at the top of the screen clips 16 pixels as soon as the top one is out of range, which probably isn't a big deal.<br /><br />I'm surprised by how much CPU this takes up <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />.<br /><br />Note there is a bug in my code where megaman does not flip properly, still a wip. This comparison is based on the first code posted by 3gengames, I didn't try the latest. As well if you run these in NintendulatorDX it will show you cycles used.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, sweet. Thanks for the comparison, ours both seem pretty good. I may optimize it by putting a lot of the variable in to ZP, as right now only a total of 4 variables are in zeropage, and one if used for the &quot;metatile file&quot; pointer (LDA [ZP],Y) and the other is just a jumper, for a JMP [Indirect]. I believe I can get a decently big performance helping (Guessing about 5-10%? Maybe more?) if I unload just 8 or so to ZP. It seems worth it to me, so I'll probably do that. But ours are pretty close! Interesting to see, any chance of you posting your code? And my metatile rotation is as described above, the decreasing buffer just gets shoved to VRAM from a buffer, while increasing gets just put straight to OAM.<br /><br />Also, if my objects go over the tile limit of the PPU, the object which got shafted on the sprites for that frame will for 100% certain have all tiles in OAM the following frame. Not a big deal, but it does it. Mixing those with OAM rotation and all that crap don't garuntee it will be displayed, however. But, up to 16 tiles per scanline work well, so I'll just have to live with telling everyone not to abuse the 8 sprites/scanline very much, to keep it in the limit.<br /><br />Are you going to release your source? I won't use it, just wanting to see how you go about things instead. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />ETA: Also, yeah mine clips the top 16 pixels. I just tested it on my TV and only the top 3 or so pixels were shown at all. On an HDTV it'll be worse, but there's not much I can do about it. Also, I'm going to change it to at compile time. You will select which type of sprites you use, either 8x8 or 8x16 and it'll either INC 1 or 2 tiles, it'll depend on the flag. Source doesn't do that yet, and don't consider it useable by any means. For all I know it could have a &quot;seecret&quot; game breaking feature, so I wouldn't recommend using it. But I could add it to read PPUCtrlRAM byte to dynamically do sprite Y sizes, but I don't think any project will switch back and forth, so I'll probably keep it the way it is right now. And I also tested mine on my NROM-256 test cart today, it worked just fine. Exactly like in FCEUX, so that's always a plus. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

That is still in a testing state and I'm going to implement it as an easy to interface to unit/library. <br />Current status is much improved, still debating 8x8 or 8x16 sprites, but I can process 40 sprites (4 megamans) in ~6600 cycles. Seems not too bad.<br /><br />It can do everything a normal sprite can do with optional clipping/wrapping. Megaman's metasprite only takes up 13 bytes too!<br /><br />The metaspite format I tried to keep as low level and similar to the hardware. I want to think of this as a driver. Objects are a higher level, and there is not a proper definition of height/width, I'm going to have to handle that in the object level. <br /><br />Ideas from many people implemented, thanks for sharing. 3gengames , tokumaru, Celius, Bregalad are obvious names that somehow helped by posting their ideas. #nesdev is a help too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I am still playing around with this. Speed is a priority for me: I think this is an idea worth pursuing though it means more code (ROM). I decided to try a method of checking quickly if the sprite is entirely offscreen or onscreen to save cycles. It seems to work well. I also implemented flipping inside the metatile engine, since I need to have width and height information. This thing will clip at y &gt; 238 as well.<br /><br />Press start to switch control to another megaman. If you move them all offscreen, onscreen or to the screen edges you can see the change in processing time. There is one small bug that is a bit tricky to fix.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah, so basically do a first compare to check if the X location+Width &amp;&amp; Y location+Height is still on the screen, and then if so just decode the whole thing straight to save time? I'll probably go back and add that, I can add spare code, too. I mean, the routine is only...0x240 bytes, about...0x300 or so isn't too bad at all. Good idea!
