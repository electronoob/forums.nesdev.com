<br />
<br />and i just discovered that YOU CANT save in secret of evermore.
<br />
<br />because when you save the game, it will save but the file will be corrupt. 
<br />you cant load your game at all or load with a lot of glitchs. with any secret of evermore version i tried. 
<br />anyone can get the save working ?
<br />
<br />thanks

<br />I can confirm this issue.  My ROM is a dump I made myself from the actual cart.  Perhaps it's an anti-piracy measure or something.
<br />
<br />Edit: Emulator saves load fine. Again, probably an anti-piracy measure, and in any case, it's probably going to require a patched ROM (as with Star Ocean). <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Secret of Evermore isn't known to use any form of anti-piracy. Atleast UCON64 doesn't crack it and it cracks most if not all SRAM based anti piracy as well as a few of the Capcom ROM based ones.
<br />
<br />Do you have to go far into the game to save? If I have time I'll try it out. I can't think of any good reason why it wouldn't work properly unless it is detecting header information wrong.

<br />
<br />There is no evidence to suggest it's an anti-piracy effort, so that should be considered complete FUD at this point in time.  Please don't go that route.

<br />
<br />As for how far you have to go to save... I'd say it takes 5-10 minutes on a totally fresh file. However, if you have an existing save and start a new game, you can hit Start to skip the initial cutscenes, then head up, avoiding most of the plants' attacks, then die at the boss on the next screen, at which point you will be dragged to a save point where you can save in another slot.
<br />
<br />From there, a soft reset is enough to see that the save in the new slot is corrupted.
