Sorry for double posting but I don't think this really warrants another thread.<br /><br />I originally intended to implement the APU Mixer by using the lookup tables documented on the NESDev Wiki:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdevwiki.org/index.php/APU_Mixer_Emulation">http://nesdevwiki.org/index.php/APU_Mixer_Emulation</a><!-- m --><br /><br />However, I ran into problems as the mixer tables output a value between 0 and 1 and the sound API in Java appears to only accept signed byte values as input so I switched to just adding up all the output values of the various channels and outputting that directly.<br /><br />What I was wondering is, if it is possible to deal with this by adding the values together, why are the lookup tables used? Is it more efficient or does it actually produce better sound?<br /><br />Also, what needs to be done to the values output from the lookup tables to makes it outputtable (unless most programming languages accept sound this way - admittedly i'm pretty ignorant of most other languages).<br /><br />I apologise if the above sounds stupid. I'm a bit confused as to how it all works.<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br /><img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3421">NESmongoose</a> — Sat Apr 12, 2008 10:55 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">NESmongoose wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Hi.<br />I have the waveform channels implemented (I think) but I can't figure out how to determine the frequency that the sounds should be played at.<br /></div><br /><br />The NES outputs a new sample every APU clock (1789772.72727272__ Hz).  PCs don't stream audio anywhere near this frequency, so you'll have to downsample to the more traditional 44100 or 22050 Hz.<br /><br />This would mean that for 44100 Hz you would need to reduce ~40.58 (1789772.7272 / 44100) APU-generated samples into one single PC output sample.  There are several approaches to this.. some more complicated than others, and some higher quality than others.<br /><br />The easiest and lowest quality way is just to skip over ~40 samples, then output the 41st sample.  This is what older NSF players like Nosefart did.<br /><br />Another way which produces a much better sound is to take the average of all ~41 samples and output that.  That is, sum them and divide by 41.<br /><br />Another way is to employ a form of Band Limited Synthesis.  Here is a page outlining the procedure:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://slack.net/~ant/bl-synth/">http://slack.net/~ant/bl-synth/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I've implemented the APU Mixer Emulation tables. Would it be the case that the value resulting from the mixer is multiplied by the APU clock rate?<br /></div><br /><br />No... multiplying samples by the clock rate would just make your audio insanely loud (actually, it would cause them to wrap/clip and would destroy the sound).<br /><br />Unless I'm misunderstanding.  To be honest I don't know what APU Mixer Emulation tables you're referring to.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I could be being dense but as far as i'm aware, Java only allows you to output signed bytes to its Mixer. Wouldn't this make using the above tables not possible?<br /></div><br /><br />Again.. not sure what tables you're talking about.  But audio samples are (usually) 16-bit signed.  That is... -32768 is low, 0 is the center, and 32767 is high.<br /><br />Basically you'll be outputting the sum of each channels output (or the sum of a scale of their output).  So if square 1 is outputting $08 and the triangle is outputting $04, then you would output $0C for that sample.  Or if you're scaling them (to make the triangle louder, for example), you would multiply the channel output by something first before summing them.  Or possibly run the output through a LUT of sorts to scale it up.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />How often should I be clocking the frame counter?<br /></div><br /><br />~240 Hz.  The exact clock rate is kind of complicated.  For details, you can look at the documentation that comes with blargg's APU test ROMs.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.slack.net/~ant/nes-tests/">http://www.slack.net/~ant/nes-tests/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Roughly, you clock it once every 7459 cycles.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Finally, how often should the Sound Channels themselves be clocked?<br /></div><br /><br />Every cycle.  1789772.7272 times per second.<br /><br />Note you only clock the period dividers this often (which in turn clocks the noise generator / duty cycle generator / tri step generator).  Other parts of the channel like the sweep unit, length counter, decay, etc, etc are clocked by the frame counter which happens much slower.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Mon Mar 31, 2008 8:58 am</p><hr />
