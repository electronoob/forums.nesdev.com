		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Alright, so I learned today that the SNES' is technically just a <em>bit</em> inferior overall than the Genesis due to data cycles and stuff I forgot about, but a large portion of the slowdown stemmed more from the lack of good know-how as compared to the Genesis; you could argue that the 65816 was a no-name CPU against the 68000.  Coded to the metal as efficiently as possible, it would be possible to create an SNES game that ran well, and possibly even hold it's own against the Genesis, even more-so if you decide to use cartridge add-ons.<br /><br />Another is that slowdown, if it's ever encountered, should be left alone and hope that it's only brief enough that you wouldn't notice.  Unfortunately, deadlines, poor management, and poor planning will take their toll on how a game runs.  Sometimes games were just made to run and that's all, sometimes games were essentially aborted and simply finalized.  Often times, the game designers just winged it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The 65816 was not a no name CPU. Other systems used it too. The 65xx family of CPUs is very well known.<br /><br />TMNT's status bar glitch results in the use of sprite hit zero being used to time a series of writes near the bottom of the screen to make the status bar appear there. But when the processing loads exceeds a certain amount the game misses it's cue to do this. This results in a frame being shown without the Status bar in position. By giving the game more cpu time which is easy in emulation, this problem can be totally eliminated. As tepples said, the other solution is to have an IRQ in the cartridge mapper hardware to generate an interrupt at the precise time so that regardless of CPU load the status bar will always be drawn correctly. <br /><br />The NES unlike more modern systems doesn't have a ton of CPU time to perform calculations. Neither do the SNES or Genesis. You can achieve good results with each platform, avoiding terrible slowdowns. It all depends on how your game is programmed and how much you need to calculate in a given time period. <br /><br />We don't need another SNES is &quot;inferior&quot; to the Genesis or vice versa topic. Both systems have advantages and disadvantages. Both games have great examples of games that are impressive and run very well. Both game examples of games with crazy slowdown as well.

PAL NES mode might fix TMNT 1's bottom status bar.<br /><br />It's possible to <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/APU_DMC#Usage_of_DMC_for_syncing_to_video" class="postlink">&quot;abuse&quot; one of the built-in audio interrupts as a timer</a> to tell when to start looking for a sprite 0 hit, and a few games (Fire Hawk, Time Lord) do this.

One idea would be to allow the user or some kind of database to detect games to choose a scanline number to have as the point for X number of extra CPU time. Most games probably don't need a huge amount of CPU time to eliminate slowdown. I think I tried with certain games to get a rough estimate of how many &quot;extra scanlines&quot; worth of time prevented slowdowns. I don't recall now.

Since the stack is constantly rising this gives you more time to make more chains/combos and to survive in general (if the stack hits the ceiling you loose). You would benefit from slowdown the same way.<br /><br />In Megaman it's not always beneficial, if the slowdown suddenly stops you might be taken off guard and be shot in the face. But I see that they wants Megaman 9 to play like the original 6 games.

I wouldn't turn on bullet time at the first sight of a dropped frame though, I'd probably wait for a few of them close together (say, 5 out of the last 10 frames). The effect also shouldn't be turned off too soon, so after a minimum amount of bullet time the engine would wait for a number of consecutive frames without lag (but I'd still fake the lag to the player during that time, since it's bullet time).

It's actually pretty annoying for the music not to continue to play properly despite whatever may be happening on screen. Speaking of slowdown, I think it's Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout runs at 30fps all the time. However by overclocking it can actually run at 60fps I think. But I'm guessing either it was poor programming and they purposely tried to make it consistantly 30 frames or maybe it was a lucky accident that it remained consistent.
