NESDev wiki also <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0_submappers#071:_Codemasters" class="postlink">assigns a submapper to Fire Hawk's one-screen mirroring</a>. Why?<br /><br />The two new Dizzy games (<a href="http://yolkfolk.com/playdizzy/sdg.htm" class="postlink">Wonderland Dizzy</a>, <a href="http://yolkfolk.com/mwd/" class="postlink">Mystery World Dizzy</a>) released by the Oliver Twins are set to Mapper 2, even as Wonderland Dizzy retains the CIC stun code. All Camerica games other than Fire Hawk and the Quattros work nicely as Mapper 2 (UNROM). The additional latch register range from $8000-$BFFF and the CIC stun register range from $F000-$FFFF do not seem to throw UNROM emulation off the rails in any emulator except FCEUX, and the latter is thrown off because it always emulates bus conflicts. If the point is that UNROM has bus conflicts while Camerica boards don't, <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0_submappers#002.2C_003.2C_007:_UxROM.2C_CNROM.2C_AxROM" class="postlink">UNROM's submappers</a> already account for this.<br /><br />I found this question <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=3467#p25661" class="postlink">asked once before</a>, but not answered. My motivation for asking is that the Everdrive N8 does not support submappers and requires the Camerica games at Mapper 2 except for Fire Hawk and the Quattros, and doing so seems like a sensible idea in general.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The original purpose of submappers was mostly to obviate &quot;ugly hacks&quot; in the existing mapper implementations. If you look at how emulators disambiguate Fire Hawk's special case, it's a big mess. A CRC check is perhaps cleaner but inflexible. Others heuristically change the mirroring behaviour depending on which values get written to $8000 by the game, which seems to work in practice but is a little bit horrifying, if you're of a certain mindset.<br /><br />Its true that these games seem to run compatibly as UNROM, but it depends where you're trying to do the bare minimum to get the games to run, or you want more thorough accuracy. For example, if you were looking to exploit a bug for a speedrun opportunity, it will probably become <em>very</em> relevant whether $8000-BFFF can bank PRG or not.<br /><br />Emulating bugs correctly is important to many people (not just speedrunners). Probably the design of the code never intends to write to $8000-BFFF, but that doesn't mean it won't ever. If you're running on UNROM instead, you <em>know</em> that emulation and discovery of any such behaviour is compromised.<br /><br />Why did they get their own mapper? Because <em>1/4 of the address space doesn't behave like UNROM</em>, and that seems like a huge and clear difference to me. I don't think this is really about &quot;lumping&quot; vs. &quot;splitting&quot;. These mapper assignments were made long before submappers were an idea, the submappers are just a coping mechanism to get us out of that hole. You don't get to reassign mapper 71 in 2017.<br /><br />If you just want to change the headers on your ROMs and run them as UNROM, though, there's really nothing stopping you. Probably none of us in this conversation will notice a difference either way.

Bus conflicts are not necessarily a trivial difference: this broke the game's ending!<br /><br />Some emulators do support submappers for UNROM, but a <em>lot</em> don't. Dreamworld Pogie wasn't using an NES 2.0 header, and I think it was just using mapper 2 because they presumed it would have the widest compatibility (everybody implements mapper 2, not everybody mapper 71)-- unfortunately it had a bug that made this not true. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Mapper 2 is kind of a minefield for this problem, since emulating bus conflicts or not are both compatible modes for the vast majority of games-- the differences come up in obscure cases like this that are hard to catch in testing. The NES 2.0 submapper solution doesn't help when using emulators (or e.g. Everdrive) that don't implement it!

From reading your response, it seems to be more about the NES header containing just enough information for an emulator to run the games properly, versus the header serving to &quot;document the hardware&quot; for other purposes, such as swapping ROM chips between compatible boards. Obviously, you could not put Contra on a Camerica board, for example, because of the address space differences.<div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">By the way, the related new Oliver Twins game Dreamworld Pogie had a bug exposed by emulating UNROM bus conflicts.

This FCEUX-specific behavior causes quite a number of problems with other unlicensed games as well, mostly CNROM-like ones.<br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If you look at how emulators disambiguate Fire Hawk's special case, it's a big mess.</div>Nintendulator's heuristic is pleasantly simple: Use horizontal/vertical mirroring from the NES header until $9000-$9FFF is written to, which no game other than Fire Hawk does.

We've got <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/" class="postlink">other sources</a> for collecting detailed information about various boards. The iNES header is just trying to provide enough information for correct <em>emulation</em>.<br /><br />Software that works as intended probably won't show a difference in emulation between the UxROM and Camerica setups, but <em>all software has bugs</em>. I guess it's like &quot;undefined behaviour&quot; in programming languages, if you consider the bugs to be important to the experience, you need to emulate the correctly. If you consider them to be &quot;undefined&quot;, maybe you don't care whether the bug is accurate to the original, you're ready to reset the game anyway. From the software developer's perspective, you'd probably have good expectations for something to be able to run on both mapper 71 and mapper 2, because you don't know about your own bugs (else you'd fix them). Very popular games have well known and well documented bugs, but unpopular games do too-- and we probably won't discover them if we only ever emulate them as &quot;compatible&quot; hardware. That's the difference this makes.<br /><br />The original iNES file format presumed there would only ever be 16 mappers. Just getting a game to run at all was kind of amazing, and I don't think bus conflicts were even being considered at that point. Splitting Camerica games to mapper 71 was a subsequent refinement. Adding bus conflict emulation was another later refinement, and <em>very</em> lately we can add bus conflict designation as submappers (not really put to much use yet). The final form wasn't known in advance, this is the product of a lot of years of corrections being made.<br /><br />In the case of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/47744432/dreamworld-pogie-a-new-old-game-by-the-oliver-twin" class="postlink">Dreamworld Pogie</a>, I have no idea whether the carts they eventually made were subject to bus conflicts (did anyone here get one?). The code itself, however, was clearly written with bus conflicts in mind. All the bank writes were through a table, just as you normally do with bus-conflict mappers. The bug was the result of a typo writing to the wrong part of the table.<br /><br />So, I mean, if you're a developer maybe you would want to try your software as if on different compatible boards, but I don't think that's a good example purpose. Usually you would know the intended hardware for your software. Running ROMs on a foreign board isn't really that common, except as a repro/pirate/donor problem, I think? Accidentally causing bugs, though, just by playing, lots of people do that. Intentionally causing bugs as a speedrun exploit, etc. is another thing that many people do (and need accurate emulation to rely on).

It writes a 01 to the bank select area, which is any memory location from $C000-$FFFF.  But the value in 1C00C (last bank in the ROM) is an 02.  If the CPU wins the bus conflict or bus conflicts are not emulated, then the right bank is loaded and the game works normally.  If the ROM wins the bus conflict or bus conflicts are emulated so that it wins, then the wrong bank is loaded and the game works incorrectly.
