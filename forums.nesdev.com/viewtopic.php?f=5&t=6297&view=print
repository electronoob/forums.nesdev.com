		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have been toying around during my lunch time recently on how you could make an IDE for nes development with the scintilla component.
<br />
<br />I first started with color highlighting in my lexer for ca65 and was able to reproduce the same color scheme that I defined in notepad++.  I decided to push it further.
<br />
<br />Now slowly I'm adding small options like extracting symbols like variables, procedure, constants and make them available with some auto-complete logic (for now file scope only), show comments and value (ex: PPU_ADDR shows $2002 because it found in in my header file) for a symbol on a mouse over, giving basic documentations on 6502 instructions (on mouse over again) etc.
<br />
<br />It seems that it could take some time but if I continue that way, it could become something useful.
<br />
<br />Now my question would be: if you had an ide for nes coding, what would be useful in your everyday coding?
<br />
<br />I have a lot of things that I want to try but I will wait before I mention more on the subject to see if people are thinking about the same thing.

In the case of Nesicide he has his own assembler and is kind of a complete proprietary solution (that how it was for first one, I didn't check second one yet). In my case, I want to support the syntax of the assembler(s) that I like.  Nesicide doesn't support ca65, my editor will. Basically what I'm making while toying with Scintilla is a specialized text editor that:
<br />
<br />- Support CA65 (and maybe other ones in future)
<br />- Support syntax color highlighting
<br />- Recognize my symbols that I write in my project, project wide
<br />- Can show me the content on mouse over of symbol
<br />- Can give me online help for 6502 instructions
<br />- Offer me intellisense like Visual studio for my symbol
<br />- Show me a list of my function for current document
<br />- Could validate my syntax (if I can make it goes that far)
<br />- Give me some tool to re-factor variables when I rename one
<br />
<br />So, back on the subject, what option that could be interesting for a nes "text" editor (I will remove the IDE in this case) for your favorite assembler then?

<br />That and something based on Scintilla would work even if you don't happen to have a copy of Visual Studio. Do VS extensions work in the express edition? I seem to remember some extensions, such as the Windows Mobile SDK, requiring the paid versions of VS.

<br />
<br />I read a little bit on the subject and no, you don't need VS for distributing your package but some kind of stand alone player that is already 130 megs. A little bit of a heavy requirement. Then by reading TheFox link, you need all kind of thing to create your package like some valid key etc. That seems quite a painful process. But I agree, it would be interesting to have an extension to VS. 
<br />
<br />@Rid:
<br />
<br />As for Eclipse.. I like the fact that it's multi-platform but I never felt at home with it. I prefer Visual studio. Maybe it's because I have been using it for a while I prefer the debugging feature that it offer.
<br />
<br />My current prototyping is done with Scintilla with the .net wrapper and I'm using dockpanel suite for the tabbing function.  For now my main goal was to be able to program a few things during my lunch time that could pass under the radar and I can use more or less 30-40 minutes when I'm lucky.  I started to work on that idea to help me refresh on regex and to see if I could do my own lexer with scintilla or not.  It went more far than expected (more than coloring).  It's not operational yet. I use my current project as a test bed to see what I can do or not with the scintilla control.
<br />
<br />For now I don't like the auto-complete with scintilla since I cannot receive an event when the auto complete stop on a specific item. I want to show information about the symbol when it's available. I may have to make my own.
<br />
<br />But still, the main goal of the thread was not "it would be great to extend an ide" but more "if I had that option in my code editor, that would be great or save me time". I will give some example.
<br />
<br />1- I don't code 6502 code often or rarely these days. Because of that, when I go back to coding, I tend to forget addressing mode, which bit are affected or how a specific instruction can be used. By having some simple mouse over help for basic options and online help, that save me time to hunt in a different document.
<br />
<br />Mouse over and online help example
<br /><a href="http://s389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/?action=view&amp;current=mouseOverHelp.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/th_mouseOverHelp.png" alt="Image" /></a>  <a href="http://s389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/?action=view&amp;current=OnlineHelpExample.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/th_OnlineHelpExample.png" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />
<br />2- I want to use symbol over pure address/value but I tend to forget their value. To mouse over a specific item and tell me the comment I wrote about it without opening the include file is useful.
<br />
<br />Example:
<br /><a href="http://s389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/?action=view&amp;current=SymbolInformation.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/th_SymbolInformation.png" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />
<br />3- I don't remember all the symbol I wrote and it what scope. To have auto-complete for them is a time saver.
<br />
<br />Example of auto-complete (but Scintilla one doesn't work well yet...):
<br /><a href="http://s389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/?action=view&amp;current=Autocomplete.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/th_Autocomplete.png" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />
<br />4- I use scope and struct often in ca65. If I had auto-complete for that, that would be great.
<br />
<br />5- I would like to go automatically where a symbol is defined at a press of a button
<br />
<br />6- (wishful thinking)  If my code editor could check my syntax and found error that cannot be found by the compiler, that would be great.
<br />
<br />Thinks like this. Those are not specific to integration in an IDE but just what I would find useful. Like mentioned, I'm just prototyping. This editor is not operational yet, just testing what I can do and how to do.  I hope I can prototype an example of scope between file (i.e. I can see the symbols of the local file and included one without issue).
<br />
<br />If it does become an editor someday, I want to support more than ca65 so it could be useful to other people too. I think once most of what I want to do in ca65 is done, doing it for other assembler that don't have scope should be a breeze.

In fact, I could really use your help!  You are correct about the first nesicide.  The second nesicide still has an in-built assembler.  It is ASM6 written in new clothes [flex/bison].<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Banshaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Nesicide doesn't support ca65, my editor will.</div><br />The intent of nesicide is to contain an internal assembler to "get people going" but also to be externally hookable to a compiler/assembler/linker of user choice.  I got to the point with the original nesicide of being able to interact with a stand-alone ASM6.  The drawback there is that there was no efficient way to marry the assembler with the main tool [and get everything I wanted from the assembler for use with the debugger].  In the second nesicide with the internal assembler I can do things like step through the original source code.  It currently works well for some NROM examples I've tried.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Banshaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- Support CA65 (and maybe other ones in future)<br />- Support syntax color highlighting<br />- Recognize my symbols that I write in my project, project wide<br />- Can show me the content on mouse over of symbol<br />- Can give me online help for 6502 instructions<br />- Offer me intellisense like Visual studio for my symbol<br />- Show me a list of my function for current document<br />- Could validate my syntax (if I can make it goes that far)<br />- Give me some tool to re-factor variables when I rename one<br /></div>
<br />
<br />The second nesicide has a syntax colorizer that essial wrote back when he was helping me.  He's long since disappeared, hence the need for more help!  The assembler I wrote provides symbols, IR-to-file/line mappings and symbol addresses which can be used by the debugger.  As a matter of fact I am probably minutes away from implementing symbolic debugging, which would include [in my hopes anyway] the 'hover over to inspect' variety.
<br />
<br />Lastly the second nesicide is cross-platform...works on Linux, Windows, MacOS, etc.
<br />
<br />Well...check out nesicide2 and see if you think it would be worth helping get your features into the IDE.  I really could use the help and I agree that your list of planned or existing features is must have!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since my time for hobby is almost non existent with my second child and the rules that changed at work, my first goal for the prototype was to make a quick editor that would be useful right away to do some nes programming (and remove some stress from the current the boring stuff at work).
<br />
<br />I will check how to get the source code of Nesicide 2 (git? Don't know the tool so I must figure that out first), try to compile it and see what it does. After that I can see if I can contribute some of the thing I want to do in my code editor.  If there is any doc on how to make it work on the windows platform, I would like to read it because from my quick overview of the site, the information seemed to be lacking (maybe I didn't check properly). 
<br />
<br />But still, what would be the other "must have" option for the code editor? Multi-assembler support? Other things that could be useful?

<br />
<br />Anyways, good work Banshaku. If you can get something like this to work well it's going to be very useful. Just be careful about adding features, it's better to have a few features that work well than a bunch that don't. Also don't neglect the basic features that you would find in any text editor.

<br />
<br />Yeah. For now I'm only prototyping ideas but I want to get out of that phase soon since already it would be useful to edit some of my code.  To make it more viable, I need to add a project explorer. Then the next step is to be able to see symbols across file when the scope apply. Once this is done, that would already be quite useful.
<br />
<br />There is still the grunt job of defining the complete help file from <a href="http://www.obelisk.demon.co.uk/6502/reference.html" class="postlink">this reference</a> (I asked permission long time ago) and the mouse over reference too.
<br />
<br />As for the text editing, the scintilla control by itself covers many editing need which is a good thing. What is left it to program a few things like commenting up code and a few other things.  I just hope I can get something working soon because I already want to use it myself.

<br />
<br />I actually started working on a NES IDE using Eclipse Plugins, but I don't have Eclipse Plugin experience so for me it has been a painful ordeal, and I have next to nothing to show for it.   My short term goals are to simply have the ability to run external tools (assemblers, emulators, etc..) and over time provide a more integrated experience.
<br />
<br />Prior to that I just created a standalone java program that ran several of the tools I'd written (nametable layout, sprite drawing, converting images to NES format, etc..) but I think most of us dream of the day when we can do NES development as easily as we can develop for other languages and platforms.
