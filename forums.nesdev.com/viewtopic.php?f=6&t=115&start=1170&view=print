<br />
<br />I've tried some of those and haven't been able to rip them. Short Order - Eggsplode, I got it to play but some of the channels are missing. Of course I ain't going to release a rip like that.
<br />
<br />I may try them again soon. Right now I'm in the middle of ripping a multi-cart with 20 games. Asder 20-in-1.
<br />
<br />Be patient though, because I'm the only one ripping right now. Sometimes ugetab comes along and rips one or two. 
<br />
<br />If you'd like to try ripping them yourself, I can guide you through some of the basics, but you'll still have to figure out how to get the rip done.

<br />
<br />To start, it's pretty simple.
<br />
<br />1.) Make a NSF directory, make sub-directories with emulators, etc.
<br />
<br />2.) Gather tools
<br />
<br />3.) Get some documents
<br />
<br />4.) Get some ROMs you want to work with
<br />
<br />5.) Load ROM in a emulator with a debugger. Set write breakpoints to $4000 - $4008. Dump PRG-ROM $8000 - $FFFF. Works for one bank drivers. Disassemble that bank with DCC6502.
<br />
<br />6.) Load file in a hex editor, prepend NSF header. Become familiar with the NSF spec.
<br />
<br />7.) Track down Play address in the NMI interrupt or through the stack at $0100 - $01FF.
<br />
<br />8.) Track down init address by examining reset code and the sound driver code. May take some effort to track the init down. Sometimes you have to write code for those that don't have the usual init routine.
<br />
<br />9.) Write code for init and/or play and then load up in favorite NSF player. Test the NSF rip thoroughly in different players and examine the code so that it conforms to the NSF spec. Make sure the tunes are arranged.
<br />
<br />
<br />For now, learn what JSR, RTS, JMP, LDA (various address modes), STA (various address modes) these opcodes mean for starters. Then learn the rest as you go along.
<br />
<br />Learn hexadecimal and binary numbers. Get a NES memory map and know the difference between ROM and RAM.
<br />
<br />Lean about the NES audio hardware registers. Learning the other registers will help because then you know the audio code will not be in that area, more than likely. 
<br />
<br />There is a lot more to it, but that's the very basics. Any questions?

<br />
<br />You can also make a new thread if you like. Maybe others will join in too, they usually help people that want to learn.
<br />
<br />It wouldn't hurt for you to brush up on programming concepts, I think. I didn't bother to learn all that stuff at first. I only wanted to hack ROMs, lol. Of course, a lot of that stuff came later anyways.
<br />
<br />I do suggest that you read these documents <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/docs/110/" class="postlink">Assembly in One Step</a> and <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/docs/423/" class="postlink">Programming the 65816</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The first one is short and easy to follow and is strictly 6502. The second one covers 6502, 65C02, 65802 and 65816. It covers all those CPUs quite well and covers a lot of basics. Be prepared for a long read for this document.

<br />
<br />Oh yeah, most certainly.
<br />
<br />The only thing is that everyone writes their own music driver differently as can be expected. Also, you're dealing with a raw disassembly which makes it a bit tougher. Who knows, you might even pick up some new methods from examining other code.
