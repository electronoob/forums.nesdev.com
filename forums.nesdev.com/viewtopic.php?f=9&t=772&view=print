		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi. I bought a Play Messiah NES wireless controller from Lik-Sang several months ago, and it didn't work on my Australian Mattel-branded NES. I sent it back (twenty odd bucks postage), to receive a replacement that also didn't work. So I bought another NES (didn't work), then I waited for Lik-Sang to get an Australian NES for themselves to test. That didn't work either.
<br />
<br />So I can safely say that the Play Messiah NES controller is incompatible with an Australian NES. At the time I thought, well, bugger it. I'll pre-order a Generation NEX console. But with the negative reviews (and Lik-Sang's seeming to have decided not to stock it - they're listed as unavailable right now), I'm hoping to get the wireless controller to work on my Australian NES - otherwise I've just wasted quite a lot of money.
<br />
<br />I can solder and such. Anyone have any ideas what the incompatibility could be, and how to fix it? I can't seem to find anything to suggest that Australian NES controllers are wired any differently than any other NES controller. I can say that the Play Messiah SNES controller works on the NES with an adapter cable...
<br />
<br />Any help would be greatly appreciated.
<br />
<br />Chris

The NES controller is like half a SNES controller, so I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't work in a PAL NES when it was intended for an NTSC NES.

<br />or some other model, especially one with a turbo function? And did these incompatible controllers carry a Nintendo seal or not?

<br />I have once encountered a non-functioning controller, and it had a bad chip (4021) once i replaced it the controller worked fine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />At first I thought how could they possibly mess up a shift register!  The only electronics inside the NES004 controller is the one chip.  Then I opened a NES004<strong>E</strong> controller and saw more.  There are pull up resistors on the clock and latch lines.  Apparently the Mattel NES (and possibly all European NES) use open drain outputs.  The NES can pull those lines low, but needs the pull up resistors to set the lines high.  That means a European controller will work on a USA system, but not the other way around.  The dog bone controller also includes pull ups.
<br />
<br />So the simple fix for the Messiah receiver is to add those resistors.  They are ~3.5K in the NES004E, I used 1.5K because it was closest to me.  Open up the receiver by taking off the rubber pads and taking out the screws under them.  Their NES cable has 5 wires going to the board.  Solder a resistor between the black wire (bottom) and the red wire (top).  Solder another resistor between the yellow wire and the red wire.  Pict is at <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/NEX/wireless.jpg" class="postlink">http://www.retrousb.com/NEX/wireless.jpg</a>
<br />
<br />I wouldn't say Messiah designed it badly because apparently this difference isn't well known.  Just means they didnt test the controller with any foreign systems.  I will forward this information to them in hopes they will have another revision with the problem fixed.

<br />
<br />Strange, my controllers have only 8 pull-ups (at buttons), it seems like it matches to the USA controller by 100% <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />

<br />
<br />This is from memory, it's been a few years...
<br />
<br />If you open up an (old style) European/UK NES, the controller ports are attached to a little PCB. The data lines have diodes in. In a US NES, the port pins connect directly to the main board. (It's not a PAL-specific thing, since the PAL Hong Kong version NES doesn't have the diodes either.)
<br />
<br />My guess is that this might have been done due to European EMI/RFI regulations.
<br />
<br />Anyway, if you prefer, instead of modifying the Messiah receiver PCB, you can open your NES, and either replace the controller ports with a no-diodes one from a US NES (no soldering needed), or bypass the diodes by soldering wires to them.
<br />
