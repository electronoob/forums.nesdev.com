<br />
<br />For a Winamp version history, see here: <a href="http://www.winamp.com/player/version_history.php" class="postlink">http://www.winamp.com/player/version_history.php</a>
<br />
<br />By "broken", Winamp simply crashes in in_notsofatso.dll.
<br />
<br />I'll gladly test any debug builds if you need a guinea pig, Disch.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've more or less put NotSo on indefinite ice.  I considered picking it up again, but if I do I'm moving away from WinAmp (foobar2k is a likely candidate, but I can't say I'm thrilled about it).
<br />
<br />Winamp simply doesn't do it for me anymore.  And I see more and more people moving from it these days (mostly to fb2k -- but to other things as well).
<br />
<br />I might be more motivated if I could work solely on the back end music generation and have someone else code the GUI/Player interface.  That's the main thing keeping me from working on my emu as well -- I have a blast with the emulation... but I just <em>hate</em> making the UI.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, basically Notso Fatso is dead, is what you're saying.  I'm glad it's open-source so someone can "possibly" pick it up, but the author of the code always knows the code best... :-(
<br />
<br />I don't mind the idea of fb2k, but I've run into too many little tweaky UI-related bugs, which I myself can't even fix because the core UI of fb2k isn't open-source.  I've reported them to no avail...
<br />
<br />I'm now left wondering what people are going to use for NSF playback, without having to rely on standalone applications.
<br />
<br />Either way, good luck with future endeavours :)
<br />
<br />P.S. -- problem persists with Winamp v5.094 (came out a few days ago).

I know someone who might be interested in writing a basic plug-in for Foobar2000 if a simple library is available.

<br />
<br />Anyways, I now have a working Notso Fatso plugin again.
<br />
<br />Disch, your code is good, but horrendous in some parts :P.  I also urge you to get friendly with the "const" directive in C/C++.  It would've caught this bug from the get-go.  It's amazing this plugin worked at all.  You pretty much were running on pure luck with allocated memory pages...
<br />
<br />Let me know if you want a patch or updated source/header files (which also work with the later VC++), so you can release 0.852 as a pure bugfix.  Otherwise I can outline the problem here in detail, and let other people deal with building their own DLL (not my recommendation).

<br />There's another bug that's been rubbing me the wrong way for quite some time, but I've been too lazy to actually fix it.  Could I perhaps snag the source for your bugfix, koitsu?  Or could you tell me what you changed?  Or... better yet... can't you throw this line in there and recompile for me because I'm lazy? :
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">mWave_TND.bTriLengthEnabled = !&#40;v &amp; 0x80&#41;;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Goes in CNSFCore::WriteMemory_pAPU, in the 0x4008 case.  Line ~229 of NSF_Core.cpp
<br />
<br />
<br />Stupid oversight that's been there forever -- without that line the Tri Length counter is always disabled -- went unnoticed for a long while because most games use the linear counter instead, but in nsfs like RC Pro Am, it's very noticable.

<br />
<br />Re: The code changes I did previously:
<br />
<br />They're quite vast.  There were about 250+ warnings and a few hundred errors when building Notso Fatso with VS2005 (yes, the Beta, but likely the compiler warning checks are going to remain); just common coding issues which should've been done differently, etc.  Generally very minor things, but took a lot of time to fix up since there were a lot of them...
<br />
<br />I still have the code laying around, of course, but I don't think the vcproj will work on older Visual Studios.  :-(  And I don't know how to use the IDE to create the equivalent of a diff/patch which you could apply.
<br />
<br />I'd *really* love to port all of Notso Fatso to something like MingW or (ugh) Cygwin, since I really don't like the Visual Studio environment.  I'm pretty sure this is possible to do, and it's on my TODO list.
<br />
<br />Re: Triangle Length counter fix: I'll fix this up in my local copy, rebuild, and post a zip/rar as well.  Probably will call it -fixed2 (I refuse to increment the version number as I'm not the author and don't want to confuse people in regards to future builds...)

<br />Ha, that's a cute one.  I think I'll stick with the original name; I don't want to make a "fork" of anything, because forking software usually ends up confusing the living daylights out of end-users (all the MAME spinoffs are a great example).
<br />
<br />But it still put a smirk on my face ;-)
