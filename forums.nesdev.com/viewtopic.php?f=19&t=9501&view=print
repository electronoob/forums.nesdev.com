		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Depends on the game and what it does. Also depends whether you want it to play at 6/5 speed or not. If it takes advantage of the extended PAL vblank, you'll probably have a hard time.<br /><br />Anyhow, start by <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_ntsc_pal_difference" class="postlink">learning the difference between NTSC and PAL</a>. If you already know how to program an NES and hack a ROM, it should be fairly clear what you need to do from the differences. If you don't, then you will need to learn that first.<br /><br />I doubt there's a generic way to describe how to hack PAL to NTSC that you could just take and apply if you aren't already a ROM hacker, and if you are, the wiki page I linked above should be pretty much all you need. The actual steps you need to take will be different for every game. (Some games will even run &quot;ok&quot; if you just put them in the other mode.)<br /><br />If there is a specific game you are trying to port, let us know your progress, what you have tried, where you are stuck, etc.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It depends on why the game isn't compatible.<br />Some games rely on the PAL NES having a much longer vblank period, so there's more time to draw stuff.  Games like Asterix would need their VRAM update code rewritten.<br />Some games are using timed code starting from the vblank, or starting from scanline -1, or starting from a sprite 0 hit.  You can simply change the timing.<br />Some games need the music pitch adjusted back to NTSC notes.

Its just beyond my scope of programming, but I do understand what goes into it.<br /><br />I read somewhere that this game can auto detect whether its being played on a PAL or NTSC system and change accordingly.  Where did this rumor start?! (as its not true)

This triggers one of three speed settings, which have these effects in both games:<br /><ul><li>Famicom, NTSC NES, and NTSC famiclone mode (0): Normal </li><li>PAL famiclone (Dendy) mode (2): Increase movement speeds by 20%, increase music tempo by 20%, and repeat tasks that run every tenth of a second after 5 frames instead of 6 </li><li>PAL NES mode (1): Same as Dendy mode, plus transpose the pitch up a semitone, and in RHDE, redraw up to half the playfield (15x24) every vblank instead of one-fifth of the playfield (6x24) </li></ul>Codemasters games tend to do the same, just without any difference between Dendy and PAL NES because they weren't aware of Dendy.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I read somewhere that it auto detects.  But when I tried it myself it doesnt, plus there is the PAL version, and then the NTSC prototype thats not being dumped.  So A) if it DOES autodetect theres prob not a reason for the NTSC version and B) just turn off pal emulation on your emulator and there ya go, no difference.  At least I think that might be it.  <br /><br />(BTW thats cool that it CAN be done)
