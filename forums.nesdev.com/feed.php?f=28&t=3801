I guess hacking Gradius II to MMC5 wouldn't be too hard, maybe it would even be possible to redirect SRAM to EXRAM so that $5cxx is used instead of $6xxx, so that ELROM would run it, but since Gradius II uses 2k of SRAM (however, not all of it is used) and MMC5 have just 1k of EXRAM, I doubt this is possible, in that case EKROM (Gemfire) or any supperior MMC5 board will be needed. I doubt anyone would test it on real hard, since MMC5 is really a comfortable mapper to code for, hacking the game to it should be really easy in fact. If anyone would be ready to sacrifice a Koei game for it say it so and I'll hack the game to MMC5.<br /><br />I have a few notes I guess, just one page where I noted important adresses in PRGROM :<br />- PRG swapping is (originally) done arround $fcdc, and $fee6.<br />- CHR swapping is done at $fe3b and $fb78, and CHR bank swapped are in RAM at $7f0-$7f7 (for all 8 1kb chunks respectively).<br />- IRQ countown value is set at $fc10<br />- The IRQs are enabled at $fa90<br />- IRQ routine is at $fb35<br /><br />And about the game workings, all there is to know is that :<br />- The game <em>always</em> have IRQs triggering at scanlines 107, 203 and 225. Whenever the game actually do something only depends of the IRQ routine, which typically change CHR banks and/or change scrolling for the status bar. During gameplay, the game usually display blank tiles (but still have rendering on) from scanline 225 to end of the frame, which is fun.<br />- Since Konami mapper have really different IRQ working than MMC3 I used some dirty ticks to have them work in the closest way I could do it (but I haven't had much experience with MMC3 IRQs prior to this hacking).<br />- The game does everything in its NMI routine, like most Konami games. The main programm spends 100% of its time to generate pseudo random numbers, which is kind of weird.<br />- Originally, the game take all most of its sprite from pattern table 0 and all BG from pattern table 1. It always used 8x16 sprites. I hacked the game so that both pattern tables are reversed (MMC3 IRQ counter), but there is still some sprites fecthed from the left pattern table.<br />- The game switched CHR banks in pseudo 8KB banks, formed by 8 values of smaller banks. In theory, the game could almost have 256 KB CHRROM and only switch the whole 8 KB chunks at once like CNROM does, exept when banks are changed during IRQs. I've already posted the location of the big 256-byte CHR table above, I haven't noted it on paper.<br />- The mid-screen IRQ at scanline 107 is used on the pre-title screen and sometimes during gameplay too. The IRQ at scanline 203 turn off sprites, and set another BG bank set for the status bar. Eventually the IRQ on 225 switch all black CHR banks in the BG pattern table. All those switches bypass the normal pseudo-8KB engine mentionned above.<br /><br />In order to make the game work with the MMC3's 2kx2 - 1kx4 CHR sheme, I've changed the banks and their order in order from them to work in a more suitable way. I've noted this in a text file I'll paste just below. Now everyone should know everything needed to hack Gradius II. Also I'll let the IPS patch on my server for some more time in case it can be helpfull to anyone, but I won't let it forever (until someone can made a stable version of it, in that case I'll actually made a page about it like Contra).<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Gradius II sprite CHR banks :<br /><br />OLD      NEW<br />40 41 42 43   40 42<br />40 41 44 45   40 44<br />40 41 47 48   40 48<br />40 41 47 64   40 4a<br />40 41 49 4a   40 64<br />40 41 65 4a   40 66<br />40 41 70 43   40 72<br />40 41 42 43   40 42<br />40 41 42 43   40 42<br />40 41 42 43   40 42<br />40 41 44 46   40 46<br />40 41 44 46   40 46<br />40 41 44 46   40 46<br />40 41 47 48   40 48<br />40 41 47 48   40 48<br />40 41 47 64   40 4a<br />40 41 49 4a   40 64<br />40 41 49 4a   40 64<br />40 41 49 4a   40 64<br />40 41 49 4a   ....<br />40 41 49 4a<br />40 41 49 4a<br />40 41 66 4a   40 70<br />40 41 65 4a   40 66<br />40 41 42 43   40 42<br />40 41 42 43   40 42<br />40 41 70 43   40 72<br />40 41 47 64   40 4a<br />40 41 47 64   40 4a<br />40 41 65 4a   40 66<br />71 72 73 74   7c 7e<br />71 72 73 74   7c 7e<br /><br />USED &#40;19&#41; : 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 4a, 64, 65, 66, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74<br />FREE &#40;6&#41; : 6B, 6C, 7c, 7d, 7e, 7f<br /><br />GROUPS &#40;12&#41;<br /><br />40 41   UNCHANGED AT $40, $41<br />42 43   UNCHANGED AT $42, $43<br />44 45   UNCHANGED AT $44, $45<br />44 46   RELOCATED AT $46, $47<br />47 48   RELOCATED AT $48, $49<br />47 64   RELOCATED AT $4a, $4b &#40;*&#41;<br />49 4a   RELOCATED AT $64, $65<br />65 4a   RELOCATED AT $66. $67 &#40;*&#41;<br />66 4a   RELOCATED AT $70, $71<br />70 43   RELOCATED AT $72, $73<br />71 72   RELOCATED AT $7c, $7d<br />73 74   RELOCATED AT $7e, $7f<br /><br />BG bank at $4b RELOCATED AT $6b<br />BG bank at $67 RELOCATED AT $6c</div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Feb 25, 2008 11:10 am</p><hr />

Do you have any notes on what you did you could make public incase anyone else wants to try to take it further?<br /><br />And I realize now that MMC5 isn't a bad idea as there are other games, I didn't realize they had US releases. Maybe stepping it up to MMC5 wouldn't be a bad idea if you wanted to make a repro. FME-7 would make sense if you aimed or the powerpak. I didn't even realize the PowerPAK supported it till now.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Fri Feb 22, 2008 2:32 pm</p><hr />

No, the game still crashes regularaly and COMPLETELY randomly on sprite overload. I am unable to find out why, and that problem is unrelated to 8x16 sprites and jumping status bar.<br />I won't be ever able to fix any of those problems. The game relies on sprites on the same adress to show something from BG patten and something from sprite pattern at the same time, unless I can completely reverse-engineer how sprite data works in Gradius II, which would be way too hard and time consumming, I won't be able to fix the jumping status bar.<br /><br />For the crashing problem I tried to log it and after one million of tries the only sucessfull thing is that the game does an indirect jump to nowhere. It's unclear where it gets its data from, but that's from a place I haven't modified.<br />Also the game display completely wrong attributes for later levels, I don't know why bacause I made sure I know everything I modified, and I'm tired of this and officially give up Gradius port to MMC3 here.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Feb 20, 2008 9:44 am</p><hr />

MMC5 is the best chance at success, that or FME7. And there are 4-5 games that use MMC5, one game that uses FME7 in the US. So I think that makes it the most reasonable. FME7 is implemented in the PowerPak while MMC5 is not however.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Tue Feb 19, 2008 11:14 pm</p><hr />

Castlevania 3 is the only MMC5 game that was released outside Japan as I recall. So I don't see the point in hacking up a famicom cart with an MMC5 to put Gradius 2 on it.<br /><br />Like I said before, I think the game is perfectly stable now, just that you have to put up with the issue of sprites and the status bar jumping.<br /><br />I still think the best thing to do would be to try to alter the game to bankswitch the sprites and avoid the error that way. Seems like the only reasonable option. MMC5 isn't reasonable. :p<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Tue Feb 19, 2008 8:04 pm</p><hr />

I'll give the new patch a try on the Powerpak. My test in emulators didn't have it jumping from I suppose it was slowdown from the fire dragon things which before it did jump. <br /><br />What I mean by reading sprites from the sprite side is, are there any sprites that are banked in on the sprite side that aren't in use during the fire birds? Atleast in the first level there don't appear to be any other enemys on screen at the time. So couldn't you change the bank that some early enemys use for the firebirds while they are in use? I guess you'd have to play all the levels and make sure it's not possible for both things to be on screen at the same time.<br /><br />And I agree, hacking it to MMC5 would be silly since the mapper is only found in 1 NES game. And that NES game is not one to be sacrificing for another. :p<br /><br />Edit: I tested the first patch, and managed to make it crash in the first level by causing slowdown. I did the same thing in the new patch and it didn't crash. I'll do further testing, but I think your changes make the game stable now, and the remaining issue would be the sprites on BG side.<br /><br />Edit: I went through to level 2 and again, no crashing due to slowdown.

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />So it's essentially a known bug with the MMC3?<br /></div><br />Yes, and I could force it to read sprites only from the sprites side, but then the sprites will look wrong. I could try to force the CHR on the sprite side to match with the BG side in the end of level 1, but I don't think it will work, as other sprites will probably look corrupted then.<br />Unless I can hack the game to work with sprite zero hit, which is very unlikely, there is no way it'll work exactly fine on MMC3.<br />Alternatively, maybe it's possible to hack it to MMC5 or something, as MMC5 has the power to emulate almost every mapper in the world, but I doubt this will be usefull to anyone.<br />I guess I'll just leave this bug.<br /><br />However, the other bug (when CPU slowdowns) bothers me, I'll try to fix it someday, by tracing code with Nintendulator (hoping to get a CPU crash while tracing !). For some reason I don't feel like doing it right now, I haven't advanced my NES project for a few day cause of Gradius II and after all making games is much funnier than hacking an existing game (but both are fun).<br /><br />EDIT : I shink the status bar shouldn't jump when the CPU slows down now, check again my <a href="http://jonathan.microclub.ch/gradius2MMC3.ips" class="postlink">IPS patch</a>. However, I don't know if the crash problem will still occur, because I haven't been able to log a crash to know what caused it. The status bar still jumps when fire birds are on screen, but I really cannot do anything about it now.

Thanks for explaining that. So it's essentially a known bug with the MMC3? And the only way to fix that would be some attempt at trying to make it only read sprites from the one side.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Thu Feb 07, 2008 10:04 pm</p><hr />

This has nothing to do with mappers, this is a native feature of the NES.<br /><br />Since MMC3's scanline counter functions by counting access to the background patterns, when sprites are read from that side the MMC3 mistakes them for background pattern fetches and that screws up the counter.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />If there was room couldn't you bank the birds in on the sprite side inplace of something not used at the time?<br /></div><br />Yes, this is possible, but all the possible CHR combinations might need more space than what's avaliable in CHR-ROM...<br /><br />Bregalad, I don't know where you find the patience to do this kind of work.

I see what you mean now about the fire birds are on the BG table size. But what I don't get is how that is even possible. Some sort of trick to allow for more room for sprites? If there was room couldn't you bank the birds in on the sprite side inplace of something not used at the time? Or is it just an impossibility on MMC3? I hope you can figure out a solution to some of the issues. Either way the work you've done on it is awesome.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Thu Feb 07, 2008 9:33 pm</p><hr />
