I think I've read somewhere that GBA can be programmed with high level languague C++, which I don't know but guess it's easier to learn than asm. Maybe I should continue there before the NES. Some hints? Which one do you prefer?

Many people say C++ is easier, since it can do a ton more than the 6502 can, but there are so many things to learn that I haven't understood it all yet. The 6502 has very few instructions compared to C++, and I like that. If you want to learn C++, you'd actually be better off learning with something like Basic first. To me, it seems like the Latin of programming languages.
<br />
<br />I learned ASM before anything else, and I speak it quite fluently. However, it took me a little while longer because I was new to programming in general. If you know basic programming concepts, it should be easy. Learning the 30 or so instructions is really not hard. I think you're fine learning ASM before C++, but it really just depends on what you want to do.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i tried to learn c/c++ before any assembly langauges and  it was easy to get simple command line apps up and running. when it came to pointers i couldn't really wrap my head around how to use them and why i would want to. learning 6502 made it much clearer for me since i more or less understood how processors worked on an even lower level then i had when i first attempted c/c++.
<br />
<br />i'm not sure how much power game maker gives you, but i'd recommend learning general programming ideas like if statements, loops, functions, etc. because it might be harder to realize those things when dealing in assembly.
<br />
<br />it's really a matter of personal preference and knowing one will help you learn the other.

<br />A 6502 program could do anything a C++ program can so this makes no sense.
<br />
<br />There are only like 30 keywords to C++, but if you write a procedural program in C, you may find yourself using under 10. These keywords like a while loop are the same concepts you'll have to learn in any assembly language anyway.
<br />
<br />I also don't see any reason to spend any time on BASIC if your computer doesn't start up to a BASIC interpreter. The differences between C and BASIC are so negligible, you may as well go straight to C now that there's an abundance of free compilers.
<br />
<br />I would suggest learning C and 6502 simultaneously while looking at other CPUs and learning about other low level computer stuff along the way. After that, look into object oriented programming concepts and the countless other languages if you care to.

But that's only if you include that file with the math functions defined in it, I suppose. So yes, you're right about that. I guess just more work has already been done for you in the world of C++ with those files you can include than for 6502.
<br />
<br />I was thinking along the lines of Qbasic when I said Basic. And C is very similar to it, Qbasic is easier to work with though. I think anyways.
<br />
<br />But I do think the 6502 helps you understand more about how exactly things work.

<br />In both games the buttons are the arrow keys, X and Z on the keyboard. Sorry the comments in the code is in spanish.

<br />EDIT: In both demos you can restart pressing "R" on the keyboard.

I find that the platform for a project isn't that important until you know what your project really is going to be. The platform can influence your project but when you have such a large amount of choices in platforms you're better off thinking about what you want to accomplish before picking a platform.
<br />
<br />Ofcourse maybe that is your primary goal, just to make anything for a particular platform. I've been interested in developing for pretty much any console, but I've yet to think of any projects for them that really are worth while. My best work has always been with the PC as it is the ultimate platform anyway.

<br />
<br />I meant the demo you listed first. I wouldn't assume that it's your first demo without you saying so.
<br />
<br />If you plan to ever program for the SNES, you'd probably want to start out with NES first, because many things on the SNES are similar (just expanded) to things on the NES. GBA may be better to start out with if you don't want to deal with lots of limits. I assume there are less to deal with on the GBA.
