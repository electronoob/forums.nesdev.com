Or is sound too generic to actually copyright, even if it was used with another company's hardware?<br /><br />And no surprise, since 20 and 33 are actually the best tracks in the game.

Even Yamaha FM sounds aren't copyrightable by themselves, even though the FM synthesis method used to be patented. Besides, the copyright in an integrated circuit lasts only 10 years, not 95 like everything else. Samplers are where it starts to get gray, but I haven't heard of any lawsuits by a sampler manufacturer for producing a record with the manufacturer's instrument.

(Also, the thing I made <em>doesn't</em> produce ROMs that will run on a PowerPak because it uses the new Mapper 31 that <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=184116" class="postlink">hasn't yet been implemented</a> for PowerPak; though there is also an NROM export option. You can already play NSFs on the PowerPak anyway though.)<br /><br />The NSF that was distributed is 600k. VRC6 PRG-ROM only goes up to 256k, so right off the bat you need to split it up at least. (I think someone actually did make a 3 NSF splitting of it for PowerPak.)<br /><br />I think someone &quot;decompiled&quot; the NSFs back into FTM files when they came out, which would be a much better starting point to work from, since you can re-arrange and re-export a lot easier that way. Don't ask me where to find them, though (try googling). A more polite thing to do might just be to ask Virt for the FTMs.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">For a VRC6 music cart sold outside East Asia, you'd need not only an appropriate mapper but a dongle to plug into the bottom of a front-loader because I imagine most NES Control Decks aren't audio modded.

VRC6 duty, but no saw. It also explodes your data size, and has no banking capability at this point, so there'd be a lot of work to do splitting it up and adding that.
