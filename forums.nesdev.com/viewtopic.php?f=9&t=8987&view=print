<br />
<br />=== original post below ===
<br />
<br />I've installed a USB CopyNES in my NES and I'm having trouble getting it to work.
<br />
<br />When I run "USB CopyNES.exe", it tells me the NES is not on and I should turn it on. I can't really get past this point; I've tried resetting the NES, toggling the power, etc.
<br />
<br />I've tried installing D2XX drivers from FTDI, and I've tried the drivers that windows update finds. The result has been the same on two computers I've tried so far (both Windows 7 64 bit).
<br />
<br />With the USB unplugged, plays like a normal NES. If I plug it in, the game will suspend; I understand this much is normal.
<br />
<br />
<br />Has anyone else had this problem? Has anyone else tried it with Windows 7?

<br />
<br />io.c line 206:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">if &#40;modemWord &amp;&amp; 0x80&#41;</div><br /><br />Should be:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">if &#40;modemWord &amp; 0x80&#41;</div><br /><br />The former always evaluates to TRUE.<br /><br /><br />I also noticed what looks like a bug in c_playnsf.c, line 121:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">if &#40;!WriteByte&#40;NSF_banks&#91;i&#93; = header&#91;0x70 | i&#93;&#41;&#41;;</div>
<br />
<br />The semicolon looks like a mistake (there is a {} block of code just beneath it).
<br />
<br />Anyhow, haven't really tested anything yet but at least it is running finally.

<br />Could you share a compiled version that has your modification in the code? I could try and compare how it works with the original software.

<br />
<br />
<br />Another bug I found. The PowerPakLite RAM Cart loader does not correctly identify mappers.
<br />
<br />c_ramcart.c line ~470:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">if &#40;mapper == 0&#41;<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...<br />&#125;<br />else if &#40;mapper = 1&#41;<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br />&#125;<br />else if &#40;mapper = 2&#41;<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;...<br />&#125;<br />... etc.<br /></div>
<br />
<br />This code forces everything that's not mapper 0 to use mapper 1. Obviously not what you want. Just add another = to the else if statements.

Win7 didn't exist when that code was written so further testing would not have caught it.  
<br />
<br />I don't think the PowerPak Lite bug is in the final exe because UNROM works here.  Or if it is nobody else in the last ~5 years has cared...
<br />
<br />I didn't touch the NSF code so at least I can pawn that one off on someone else!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Using python and pyserial it shouldn't take more than 100-200 lines to create a decent command line interface for ram carts. Other features such as bankwatch would take a bit more effort to reimplement though.

<br />It worked in Vista before, but it always complained like this (all the time):
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.kreese.com/slask/copynes_error.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />After pressing OK the program continued, and it worked. But I had to press that OK button like 3-4 times to dump a game. I assumed that it was because it wasn't made for Vista...
<br />
<br />Please let us know if you fix any other bugs and update your build.
<br />
<br />bunnyboy: Perhaps you should update this program on retrousb.com, to the fixed version. (At least when Rainwarrior thinks he has fixed all the bugs.)
