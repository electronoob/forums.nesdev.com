<br />I think I'm done with most of the editing features now so next stage (after Christmas) is the audio coding.
<br />
<br />If anyone is genuinely interested I'll make the ROM available to play with. Would love some feedback from that too.

<br />Oh, there's plenty of HEX editing involved <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I actually thought about adding a "raw" editing mode on a separate "screen" but to be honest you can pretty much get at every byte of the song data through the various editor panes as it is <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />It will be very nice to be able to hear how it sounds on hardware as I'm editing it.
<br />
<br />I assume it's compatible with Nijuu so we can use the songs we make?
<br />
<br />Have you considered built in DPCM such as a basic drum set?  Obviously it would be very complicated to let people use their own DPCM but a preset drum kit could cover a broad range of music.
<br />
<br />Will you be releasing the source?

<br />
<br />Yeah, I think for me it would be easier to just have a hex editor than to make a whole complex native tracker. But it might be fun though to go the extra mile. I like the idea of editing music not being tedious. But I'd even be happy if I could have notepad open and hear every change in my .db statements in real time. So I think I'll actually make the hex editor more of a text editor. It will display everything in .db statements and meaningful names assigned to hex values rather than just the hex values themselves. For example, instead of seeing ".db $B0, $24", I would see ".db SetReferenceNote, Octave4.Bb". Then I could actually have a program on my computer that takes the music data saved in the .SAV file on the PowerPak, and have it turn it back into .db statements inside of a text file I can include in my project. Probably sounds crazy, but I'm actually quite comfortable with the idea. Sometimes .db statements are easier to work with than just raw data.

<br />
<br />I can't wait to have a proper play with it either! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />It's very, very easy to use so don't worry too much.
<br />
<br />It's not compatible with Nijuu, no. I approached the two things in a very different way. However, I have a feeling that NTRQ will end up being better than Nijuu - easier to use and almost equal in audio terms.
<br />
<br />Yes, it's my intention to put in a built in DPCM set but also give you the ability to build your own (it's not as complicated as you might think). DPCM is fairly new to me though so I'm experimenting at the moment.
<br />
<br />Source code? Most likely, yes. I need to look at the GPL licence and will probably release it under those terms.
