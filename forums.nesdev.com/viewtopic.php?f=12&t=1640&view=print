		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The CD7 is a CD-ROM drive that can be connected to the Game Doctor SF7 SNES backup device, so that ROMs can be loaded off of CDs in addition to floppies.  The Dumper reversed engineered the circuit for interfacing a MKE CD-ROM drive with the SF7, so that people could make custom clones of the drive.
<br />
<br />Using The Dumper's schematics and my own custom layout based on measurements taken from multiple different external CD-ROM drive enclosures, I had custom printed circuit boards made so that a professional clone of the CD7 could be built.
<br />
<br />I plan on making a prototype clone based on these custom circuit boards, and if I can get everything to work, I will make at least 3 more drives and sell them on Ebay, with a starting price of the cost of parts... which I actually don't know precisely yet, as I still haven't ordered the ICs.  
<br />
<br />Below are pictures of the circuit boards, which have 4 custom boards shown alongside a non-SF7 compatible parport-IDE interface.  I have included this other interface because it resembles what the final CD7 interface circuit board will look like, i.e., two parports on the back and one MKE ribbon cable pin set on the front side.

<br />
<br />That other PCB is from one of my enclosures, and it has nothing to do with the CD7 clone other than the fact that I "borrowed" its layout.  Most of the parallel port enclosures use a similar layout for their interface boards, which is why I based the layout on that layout: there are multiple retailers that sell enclosures that will fit this CD7 clone interface and both parport and SCSI enclosures that often sell on Ebay should also work with this CD7 clone interface.
<br />
<br />I am not sure what the PCB in the center uses its male parport for, but it is on my layout so that it can fasten to the enclosure.  If I didn't include solder holes for it, then it wouldn't adequately fasten onto the enclosure, and since I will be desoldering parts from the old interfaces, it won't be any additional cost.  So on the CD7 clone, that male interface won't serve any purpose other than matching the form factor of the enclosures' original interface.

<br />Unless you have a source of never-been-used MKEs?

<br />However, I am having a problem.  When I power on my SF7, it says "(Load CD Games) For 562B Drive" in the upper right corner and "Insert CD Please" in the middle of the screen.  Once I place a CD in the drive, it says "Waiting..." in the middle of the screen and I can hear the CD drive spinning.  After roughly 5 seconds of this, the spinning stops and the middle of the screen changes to say "Disk Format Error !".
<br />
<br />So what am I doing wrong?  I made a small ISO9660 image and burnt it to a blue CDR at 1X speed.  Here is the command that I used to make the image:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">mkisofs -iso-level 1 -output-charset cp437 -o snes.iso tmp</div>
<br />
<br />I used the file naming scheme described <a href="http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:utsYyUN-CFkJ:forums.cherryroms.com/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D2119%26view%3Dnext%26sid%3Dc23403e4819bcb985b32677ee855a821+cd7+cherryroms&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;client=firefox-a" class="postlink">here</a>.
<br />
<br />1.  Could this be a sign of a problem with the circuit board that I made?
<br />2.  Could this be caused by the kind of CDR that I am using?
<br />3.  Is there any practical way for me to obtain a known working ISO or even better, a CD?
<br />
<br />I have enough parts to build three more clones, but I won't do that until I can get my first clone working.

<br />
<br />I suspect that the interface is working OK.  What may not be OK is the drive-  either it's bad,  it does not like CDRs (did you use a CDR or CDRW?), or the image is bad.
<br />
<br />If the interface wasn't working right, I suspect it would've failed to work at all.  It sounds like it got pretty far- asked for a disk, accepted disk, spun it up, then read from it.  That most likely means the interface works.

<br />But if these old drives can't read any CD-Rs, that would suck.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> 
<br />I don't think they're as reflective as pressed CDs, and CD-RWs even less so.
<br />
<br />If it's any help, I have an old CD-ROM + soundcard interface stashed away somewhere (I'm guessing it's MKE) that I could do some kind of test with.  I'm kinda out of CD-Rs at the moment, though I could probably scrounge one up.  I already have an old PC set up anyways.

<br />
<br />I am not familiar with Windows.  Can somebody recommend a good free CD burning program that actually lets you select the details of the ISO format?  I used my wife's laptop to burn an ISO made on my Linux computer using mkisofs.  I was surprised to find that the CD burning software that comes with Windows does not allow for specifying the burn format.  Maybe if I just used some good software to do the burn, I wouldn't have these damn format problems.
