The website now links to the .zip version as well.<br /><br />As for Battletoads, the freezes look like they are caused by the code enabling rendering on scanline 14, cycle 255, right after resetting the scrolling values.  This triggers the vertical scrolling increment at cycle 256 one scanline too early, sprite 0 hit doesn't trigger because the background is drawn one pixel too high, and the game locks up.  During normal gameplay on level 2, the writes to $2001 never seem to occur before cycle ~261.<br /><br />Haven't been able to find an actual solution yet - everything that appears to fix Battletoads (or at least, the specific freeze I managed to record in a save state) makes one or more test roms fail.<br /><br />Thanks to everyone who tried it out, very much appreciated!

It made me install VS2015 64-bit runtime before starting up.  Maybe I need to bounce or something?<br /><br />Edit: I tried a few more games.  I can tell from the music and sound effects that the emulator is running, but it's definitely failing to render to the screen.  It's not a mapper specific issue; all games seem to have this issue on my box.

(it's in the video options)<br /><br />Also, could you try running this utility?<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897568.aspx">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sys ... 97568.aspx</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The &quot;Current timer internal&quot; shown by ClockRes is set to 1ms on my computer - might be different on yours, which could be part of the problem, not quite sure.

Basically, if rendering was disabled and is enabled on tick 255, the vertical scroll increment at cycle 256 will not be done (basically I added a 1 ppu cycle delay on the effect of the rendering flags in relation to the scrolling increments), which solved the tiny timing issue in my case, but it's unlikely the real hardware behaves this way.<br /><br />As for the upgrade crash, I have a feeling this may be AV related as well.

It deletes the .exe shortly after download.  In fact, Chrome popped up a warning saying not to download .exe files and it said that this particular .exe file was rarely downloaded (it's a newly posted file).  Symantec even interfered when I tried downloading it with wget via Cygwin.  I had no firewall issues.  However, I do not have admin rights to this test box.  <br /><br />I was able to download and extract a .zip containing the .exe without an issue.  The auto-update might be failing due to lack of admin rights or Symantec.  Personally, I prefer .zip files anyway.  I like to manually scan downloaded apps for malware (even though anyone on this forum could just create a custom executable that kills my machine).  And, I prefer not to auto-update if I have something that works.  Think about how annoying auto-update is in Windows.

Two should be free of charge; two require a periodic payment to a certificate authority.<br /><br /><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>Offer the download through HTTPS. HTTPS is HTTP tunneled through TLS (Transport Layer Security), formerly called SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). TLS requires a valid TLS certificate, which is an X.509 certificate certifying that a certificate authority (CA) has verified that the owner of the private key corresponding to a particular public key controls a particular domain. Domain-validated TLS certificates are available without charge from StartSSL, WoSign, and Let's Encrypt; organizationally validated ones cost more. If you have a VPS, you can install it at no extra charge; if you have shared hosting, you'll have to have your hosting provider install the certificate (for StartSSL or WoSign) or an ACME client (for Let's Encrypt) on your behalf. I had to go through StartSSL because my web host has not yet installed an ACME client, despite two duplicate questions on its Stack Exchange knockoff to do so (<a href="https://community.webfaction.com/questions/19125/planned-support-for-lets-encrypt" class="postlink">1</a> | <a href="https://community.webfaction.com/questions/18989/using-lets-encrypt-to-get-ssl-certificates" class="postlink">2</a>).</li><li>Build a history of downloads by users of the same browser of executables hosted on the same domain. This is the most important step for Google Chrome's Safe Browsing feature.</li><li>Digitally sign and timestamp each executable file with a valid Authenticode software publisher certificate. A software publisher certificate allows earned reputation to leak into other executables from the same publisher, such as new versions of a program. But unlike TLS certificates, Authenticode certificates aren't available without charge because there's no counterpart to a domain-validated certificate.</li><li>Build a history of downloads by users of the same browser of executables signed with the same Authenticode certificate. This is the most important step for the SmartScreen feature of Internet Explorer. And in Windows 8 and Windows 10, even zipped executables are subject to SmartScreen. If the certificate that you bought in step C is an Extended Validation, Internet Explorer will let you skip this step.</li><li>Submit the executable to Symantec for whitelisting prior to release.</li></ol><br />Sources: <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/r-9JQIboUmc" class="postlink">Google Chrome Help Forum</a>; Google <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">internet explorer smartscreen</tt>; <a href="https://support.symantec.com/en_US/article.TECH132220.html" class="postlink">Adding software to the Symantec Whitelist</a><br /><br />But then Symantec has a conflict of interest here, as it is also an Authenticode certificate authority.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">However, I do not have admin rights to this test box.</div><br />Have you requested that your administrator add executables or web sites to the whitelist?
