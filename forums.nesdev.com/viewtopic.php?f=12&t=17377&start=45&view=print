You will have to use keyboard shortcuts though, especially if you use Direct3D's exclusive mode.<br /><br />By default, pressing Shift+6 (not the keypad, the horizontal number key) will set either square pixels or 8:7 rectangular pixels* depending on whether you have Correct Aspect Ratio turned on. Either way, this leaves black bars on the left and right sides of the screen. I don't mind the black bars at all, but I heard they really bother a few users, so...<br /><br />Pressing Shift+7 will completely ignore the console's native pixel aspect ratio and horizontally stretch the emulated screen to fill the entire monitor. I find this horizontal stretching to be really ugly, but it does cover up the black bars if that's what you truly want.<br /><br />Pressing Shift+8 will chop off parts of the top and bottom to minimize horizontal stretching while still filling the entire screen. Depending on the game, this could chop off important info. In Super Mario World, the HUD is still visible, but a small portion of the top is cut off.<br /><br />You can also press Shift+1, Shift+2, Shift+3, Shift+4, or Shift+5 to set the resolution to 256×239, 512×478, 768×717, 1024×956, or 1280×1195 respectively. Depending on your monitor, not only will this create black bars on the left and right sides, it also creates them on the top and bottom as well.<br /><br />*Important note: 8:7 is the <em>pixel aspect ratio</em> of the SNES, or the ratio of a single pixel's width to its height. The overall <em>display aspect ratio</em> is 64:49 when displaying 224 scanlines and 2048:1673 when displaying 239 scanlines. The display aspect ratio of the NES (240 scanlines) is 128:105.<br /><br />================================<br /><br />As for Mega Man X2 not loading the first time and loading the second time instead (yes, I saw your pre-edit post): I cannot reproduce this bug, and it sounds like the other computers you tried cannot reproduce it either? In the current development version on my computer, I made a slight change to the load/unload program code to cover up a <em>possible</em> source of bugs, which will appear in bsnes-mcfly v106r06. If it does come up again, be sure to check the firmware/ folder and make sure that cx4.data.rom is intact.<br /><br />However, the preferred form is to concatenate this firmware directly to the game ROM and make a 1,575,936 byte ROM <strong>that still works in ZSNES and Snes9x</strong>. If you do that, bsnes-mcfly (and bsnes v107) will ignore the firmware/ folder and use the concatenated ROM instead, which is currently the only way to use a custom firmware if one gets created in the future. byuu has been pushing for concatenated firmware for many years now, yet No-Intro has strongly opposed it for fear of not being able to distinguish where the main program ROM ends and where the firmware begins. Something that icarus proves is a piece of cake, no harder than detecting copier headers.</div><br /><br />Thanks for the info on the shortcuts.<br /><br />Im really not sure what was causing my mega man x2 issue. It was only happening on a specific system which drove me mad. I have since formatted and reinstalled windows and fresh drivers system needed it anyway. Can no longer produce that problem.<br /><br />I currently am not using concatenate roms. But I have the proper verified by crc files in the firmware folder.<br /><br /><br />Been playing with this emulator alot since discovering it. No issues. On my media center I run the accuracy core however I tried the other 2 modes as well.<br /><br />I am really really liking bsnes-mcfly thank you for this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't think any licensed SNES games not matching those sizes exist.<br /><br />The most common firmware (DSP1) is 8192 bytes long, the largest firmware (ST018) is 163,840 bytes long, the smallest firmware (Super Game Boy boot ROM) is 256 bytes long, and the second-smallest firmware (Cx4) is 3072 bytes long. No firmware is exactly the same size as the copier header (512 bytes). All the same, <strong>I think it would be best to not consider a ROM that has both a copier header and a coprocessor firmware to be valid.</strong> It is best to treat them as mutually exclusive, and if a ROM has both a copier header and a coprocessor firmware, the emulator should reject it.<br /><br />I will note that, for byuu's preservation database, byuu will check the last 256 kilobytes (2 megabits) of a ROM and chop off the last 128 kilobytes (1 megabit) if they match the preceding 128 kilobytes exactly. Spectre, for example, is 1 megabyte long, but it can be truncated to 896 kilobytes and then mirrored back to 1 megabyte to produce exactly the same ROM. It is the 896-kilobyte version that byuu catalogues. He does this in order to guard against cartridges that, for example, store 4 megabytes when only 3 megabytes are needed. Spectre has no coprocessor, and certainly none with firmware. I don't think any of the firmware games fit this criterion though.

This allows the computer to have less overhead in emulating.<br /><br />if desktop = 3840 x 2160 and emulator runs at same it will take so much power however if user can define launch in a lower system resolution it will take less power for same emulation. bsnes/higan being very power hungry would benefit greatly from this.<br /><br />easy test run bsnes with pc set to highest resolution you and and try at lowest resolution you can.<br /><br />This very purpose is why most emulators are written to allow this change.<br /><br />I imagine byuu will eventually see this post. I believe he is currently on vacation in Japan.<br /><br />I thought you could implement the resolution swap at gui level. I fully understand not wanting to alter the higan code and agree with that thought.
