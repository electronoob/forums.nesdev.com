The ReproPak directly supports a BNROM with 8 banks (same as AOROM but you solder the tabs for mirroring instead of 1 screen), and you could relatively easily mod it to support 16 (two bent pins, one wire).<br /><br />I think many emulators may support oversize BNROM, though I'm unsure.

But the obvious oversize extension of BNROM to sixteen banks works on PowerPak, and eight banks work on the ReproPak when you configure it for BNROM. Follow the AOROM instructions in the manual but set the mirroring to VERT or HORZ instead of ONE.

Yes, $8000-$FFFF is better and AOROM is sufficient. I will use AOROM (unless chazbc24 objects).

In other banks, check for music is finished by reading a RAM flag or something like that.</li><li>If it is, select next bank and then next instruction will be the one to disable PPU.</li><li>The pattern table/name table is 5K in total, and then 32 bytes for palette, and the rest of the program code then should not take up more than 1K or 2K, so it would expect that if .NSF file can be as large as 23K (counted starting from CPU memory $8000).</li></ul><br />A question: What to do after the last song/slide is shown?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've used the ReproPak to make 60 or so AOROM repros so far. It works pretty well. (There are other simple mappers supported, see the manual.)<br /><br />It supports a limited set of mappers; I think zzo38 used AOROM, so that'll be fine. The manual will tell you what chips you need. For AOROM you want a 74HC161 (or 74LS161) latch for bankswitching, a 27C020/27C010 eprom for your PRG data, a 6264/62256 for CHR RAM, a CIClone chip, and three small capacitors.<br /><br />You'll also need a bunch of tools (soldering iron, solder, eprom programmer, wire cutters, pliers). Probably you want a plastic case to put the game in, too. RetroUSB also sells those.
