<br />I don't even know why someone loose his time making that programm.
<br />xls2db taking some calculated data from exel and transfer it as .db would be a lot more usefull.

<br />As I said in <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=11889#11889" class="postlink">a post in the other topic</a>, not all assemblers for all platforms have .incbin. Perhaps the program's author was brought up on a platform whose popular assembler did not have .incbin.

<br />
<br />Seriously man.... .incbin.  I'm not kidding.  What's the point of having a million .db lines instead of just one .incbin line?  plus if you have .db it makes it harder to edit, since you have to edit, reconvert, copy/paste to source, then reassemble.  Instead of just editing and reassembling.
<br />
<br />You're just giving yourself an extra pain in the ass here.  If you already have a binary file you don't WANT to convert it to .db.  .db is for stuff that ISN'T already in a binary file.

IM JUST GOING TO END UP LEARNING ON MY OWN IT SO HARD TO TRY AND DIPHER WHAT OTHERS ARE TRYING TO DO SOMETIMES.  EVERYTIME I THINK I GOT THE PERFECT EXAMPLE I GET A SECTION OF CODE THAT BUMS ME IN THE ASS.  IT THOSE DAMN NAMETABLES IS THE PROBLEM.

<br />If your code doesn't work, it most probably isn't because you're using .incbin instead of a large bunch of .db, that's a nonsense. By "doesn't work", you mean that the assembler refuses to assemble it or that you don't get the restults you want ?
<br />If the assembler refuses to assemble it, make sure you incbin an existing file. You should most probably set the whole pathname after the .incbin directive. 
<br />
<br />If you get bad results when tsting your ROM (blank screen), make sure you banked your code proprely and that you don't go wrong with ROM adressing. Unless you're doing some totally unrelated error, like writing data to PPU during the frame.
<br />
<br />If your assembler doesn't support .incbin, I'd suggest you just delete it from your computer and donwload a better one. By the way, if you're using Nesasm, my sugestion also apply.

<br />Download what?  Which assemblers do support .incbin.  casue if that the case i might just have found my problem.
