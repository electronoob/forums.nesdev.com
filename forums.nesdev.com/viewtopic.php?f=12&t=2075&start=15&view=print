<br />As for getting a backup of cherryroms, I don't know how to contact Recoil.  
<br />Does anyone know how to get ahold of him? 
<br />
<br />As for starting new forums, I'm trying to decide
<br />1) What I want out of them
<br />2) What others may want out of them
<br />3) How to guide the forums to meet those goals
<br />4) Maybe a name for the forums? (so people can easily refer to it)
<br />
<br />I toyed with the idea of getting a domain name as well, but I probably will just throw it all on my personal site neviksti.com since I've only been really using it for file storage so far.  If things take off, I'll get a better domain name later (unless someone can think of a great one right now, then I'll reconsider).

<br />
<br />1: That I don't know :)
<br />
<br />2: As for myself, I'd like to have a place to chat about copier related stuff. Preferably with as little emu-gaming-drivel as possible :) I think a small
<br />file section would also be nice. There are lots of text files 'in the wild' but
<br />no central place that stores them. Just the other day someone on irc asked
<br />me about some text document on the MAD-1 that he had seen "somewhere"... Or take the description of the swc internals- Many different
<br />versions. Most faulty or lacking some bits. Long story short: Would be nice
<br />to collect them at a central place.
<br />
<br />3: I think there should be several active admins that will kill unwanted
<br />threads quickly to keep the forums "clean"
<br />
<br />4: Just some brainstorming,. 
<br />copier hacking hideout  ( CHH )
<br />ccc - console copier center
<br />REP - reverse engineering plaza
<br />hacktendo
<br />REtendo (stupid.. limited to nintendo..)
<br />
<br />hm, well, no jaw-dropping ideas but that's all I
<br />can come up with right now.
<br />
<br />By the way, what sections should the forums have?

<br />
<br />use Happyemu.com domain, and/or host the forum on neviksti.com 
<br />(you will need a DB probably MySQL, an some kinda Apache + PHP softwarey thingy and most likely root level access to said server to install some forum software and configure it, how hard can it be?)
<br />
<br />Assuming that someone can GET a dump of the DB for cherryroms,
<br />
<br />#1. Make a new Forum;
<br />Put in a part for Hardware/Software information (for Developers/Tinkerers/Other interested parties)
<br />Put in a part for New users, informational and heavily moderated (lots of stickies: 'How do I do XYZ?' type stuff)
<br />
<br />#2. Take the dump of Cherry roms and add it to a READ-ONLY forum, which can be linked to from the main forum and if need be; REALLY popular topics imported into the main forum.
<br />
<br />(#2. Will probably involve FAR more than cut'n'paste but I think it can be done, with some help. I could provide assistance with what little I know about forums, ect...)
<br />
<br />Of course there may need to be some things worked out, 
<br />(old accounts? revive em or lock 'em down, Images and Attachments?, PM's? ect...)
<br />
<br />Actually The primary thing we should be aiming for is a raw dump of the textual part of the DB. Other stuff like user accounts or attachments should be a lower priority. Unless there were some important techical documents attached, then they may be needed as well.

<br />No offense, but I think happyemu.com sounds as appropriate for the 
<br />intended forum as barbiescoiffeursalon.com ... :)

I'd take on this project if no one else has finished it yet, both as a backup of cherryroms and for a new copier-centered forum. I own my own server and use it to host my group's development website as well as some commercial sites as well. The server is quite robust and secure, with plenty of space, bandwidth, and features to share. If a name can be agreed upon, I'll purchase the domain for it and have it set up in very little time, plus I'd be more than willing to admin the forum and assign admin powers to those who are deemed worthy by the members of this forum. However, I do not use phpBB due to its penchant for security problems, I use SMF exclusively.
<br />
<br />Opinions welcome.

<br />
<br />Sounds good to me Nodtveidt (how the **** am I supposed to prnounce that? :)
<br />There hasn' been much action in this thread for a while, but I'd suggest that you 
<br />just go ahead. Once there is something up and running ppl should get interested I
<br /> suppose. 
<br />
<br />As for the naming - Given that you would set up / host everything etc it'd be up to
<br />you to pick a name aswell imho. In the end it doesn't matter that much anyhow. I mean, 
<br />"cherryroms" - that didn't exactly sound great either did it? :)
<br />
<br />regards
