		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So this is the first time I've ever actually put any form of effort into making graphics. All I really have that's presentable right now are some maps, and I think they're pretty good, but it seems like a lot more is expected in terms of graphics since the NES's commercial era, so I'd like to hear opinions from someone who isn't myself, and if I should just scrap the whole thing while it's still young.<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<br />
	</div><br />What I have in mind is a bit of a cartoony look to the graphics, but not in too forced of a way; but I'm interested in thoughts, input, changes, and criticisms. Think of the actual level design as a bit of a lorem ipsum, it's mainly just barebones of what I have in mind and is of course still subject to change.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Try doing some simpler white clouds. You could even try something like Megaman 2's Airman stage, and have large cloudy shapes coming in from the top of the screen.<br /><br />There's no getting around it, the rounded corners are going to need to take into account what they're &quot;touching&quot;. You'll need multiple copies of each corner, or else you'll wind up with the issue where the sky shows through in inappropriate spaces. Try having &quot;square&quot; versions of each corner in addition to the rounded ones, and use each where it looks appropriate. Plug those holes, basically. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />The lines in the ground look a little odd, you'd almost be better off just leaving the ground as a solid color. To keep it from being boring, you can add large shaded rectangles into the ground, like if regions were popping out towards the screen. You can also paint the entire cliffside with polkadots or a checkerboard or something, that'd look pretty toony too.<br /><br />Overall, this is pretty good for your first try. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Part of it is, I want the player to be able to exit the room vertically, but only at certain spots. Rather than having vertical exits have a specific address of where to go like the pipes in SMB (I already have an idea with something like this anyway, only with teleportation platforms. Some are 1-way, others are 2-way. I think it'd make an interesting game mechanic. But I digress, ) I was planning on having the clouds be solid, and then in places where the player is allowed to leave the room by exiting up, there'll be a break in the clouds.

Also be aware that the top and bottom rows of tiles may be offscreen. For example, my television cuts almost two rows off the top and one row off the bottom. Other TVs may be better or may be worse.

Look at real trees. Research how other games handled trees. (Not Zelda 2...its trees are terrible).
