<br />I've got new UNROM boards that I could build, if you want to make a dedicated cart to demo Yars' Revenge or Assimilate.  I've got some 32kB PRG page / 8kB CHR-RAM boards also.
<br />
<br />What would be useful (that I don't have) is some kind of multi-A/V input switch.  We'll probably have more systems than TVs.  I could bring power strips, but I don't have a decent extension cord.

We gave a bazillion hardware stores within a few miles of here.  Although power-strips suck when you have lots of wal-worts.  Thinkgeek and newegg have some specialty power-strips that work well for wal-worts.
<br />
<br />Memblers, if you burned Yars' Revenge onto a physical cart, what would become of it when the MGC is over?  Its effectively a one-of-the-kind prototype (I doubt that my game will be 100% done at that point).

<br />
<br />That about sums it.  Organize, figure out how many of you are planning on doing something at the show, and we'll work out the where and how much space is needed.  Sooner the better, but keep in mind if there are maybe a half-dozen devs there and someone else wants to join in last minute, they can join you though we can't guarantee any extra space so close to the show.
<br />
<br />On a related note, themes are also important.  Figure out what you guys want whether it is sticking with the NES or something else like a Nintendo theme (NES, SNES, N64...)
<br />
<br />Later.

<br />
<br />At, or shortly after that time, I'll tally them up and post the official count for DHG Hunter's convenience.  Once we have the count and a general idea of what we want to show, we can work out (quickly I hope) how much space we would like.
<br />
<br />DHG Hunter, I really do appreciate your offer of table space.
<br />
<br />Nesdev as a community doesn't have a rigid leadership.  As far as I'm aware, there are no votes for "nesdev president", nor any secret cabal of power-brokers.  Our BBS forum is generously hosted by a fellow member, admined by a few others.  I have no formal "authority" to speak on nesdev's behalf, so I hope that I'm not over-stepping my bounds by stepping up and trying to organize what I can on my end.  I'm really freaking excited because I can walk from my house to the convention in ~5 minutes.
<br />
<br />That being said, I'd like to know if it would be acceptable (to MGC and Nesdev) to put up any banners or "booth decorations" around our table.  Sutff like the web-site logo, prominent display of the URL, maybe pass out business cards with the URL of our forums and the URL of where some of our games are sold online.  Or should we keep it very Spartan: Just use humans + NES-related hardware?

<br />
<br />From what I can remember, we have three definites:
<br />
<br />1) Myself, demoing Yars' Revenge clone on a dinky little laptop.  I can bring some power extension cords.  I will also have my SNES -&gt; USB dongles (from retrozone).
<br />
<br />2) Bigjt, demoing &lt;something?&gt;  Has a power-pak
<br />
<br />3) Memblers, who can bring some gear, but are you going to demo anything (hardware project or homebrew game)?
<br />
<br />Possibles:
<br />
<br />1) Tepples, if he gambles with his life on a greyhound bus.  Tepples, you have many games + works in progress that you could demo, too.
<br />
<br />2) Marshallh, who has a N64 device that is like a power-pak.  Might want his own area though (8-bits is not good enough I suppose....)
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If any of the above is incorrect, please post corrections.  Lets extend the deadline to Wednesday night.  Sometime Thursday morning, we'll summarize the list of table-space-requests.  I don't know if there is anything that we need to do after that for DHG Hunter or not.
<br />
<br />Memblers, bigjt, I'm fine with demoing on a 13" laptop.  However, if either of you wants to bring up a larger display, NES + PowerPak, then we can load our games onto that.
<br />
<br />If anyone misses the sign-up, but shows up wanting to demo NES, SNES, N64 related homebrew, then we can try to squeeze them in.  I can't imagine that I would want to stand at a table for two days solid...

I'll also have my laptop and I'll probably be playing a video of Gradualore's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/gradualgames#p/a/u/0/oqbcPGl5Fp4" class="postlink">Nomolos</a> project on that.  We can also run ROMs on my laptop, of course.  And we can also load all ROMs on my PowerPak and switch off demoing our stuff on that, as well.  But I think Memblers is bringing an NES and some TVs, as well, so we may have enough where we can all three be demoing our stuff at the same time, plus playing videos on my laptop.

<br />clueless, I will probably be demoing my n64 thing in the benheck room, if only because that's where i spent most of my time last year. But I'm ultimately going to end up wherever there's a TV. I probably won't be able to bring one 12 hours from home.
