		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Currently, I'm about to finish one of my NES projects and it seems like save game data gets sometimes corrupted when using it on a flashcart according to my gametesters (See pictures on how it looks like and how it's supposed to look like). The save game data that's causing problems is the player name and the arrow positions which are supposed to be kept if the game is turned off. To quote one of my gametesters - &quot;<em>I am seeing another possible issue though. This has happened twice to me now. Not sure if it is the powerpak or not, but I will run the game for hours upon hours at a time and have no problems. I will turn off the game for a day or so, and then when I turn it back on the screen where you make your name, choose the music, and that good stuff trips out. The letter options for the name are shapes, symbols, and what looks like heiroglyphics. The arrows where you choose the music, see high score and stuff, are above the options, and can go all the way to the left and right side of the screen. <br />you can continue off that screen, but the name you chose are the same shapes and symbols. <br /><br />I can remove the file from my powerpak and put the one you gave me back on, and it works fine again until you turn it off for awhile, and then it does it again</em>&quot;.<br />Also, when I play my game on NEStopia for mac, the baterry backed WRAM works flawlessly, however, it doesn't on FCEUX for Windows (Using Parallels Desktop), at least when you close the emulator. The game data just resets...<br /><br /><a href="http://s1074.photobucket.com/user/KilleRotom/media/deal000_zpsf11eb460.png.html" class="postlink"><img src="http://i1074.photobucket.com/albums/w408/KilleRotom/deal000_zpsf11eb460.png" alt="Image" /></a> How it's supposed to look like<br /><br /><a href="http://s603.photobucket.com/user/111492KH/media/IMG_6171_zps92b97789.jpg.html" class="postlink"><img src="http://i603.photobucket.com/albums/tt111/111492KH/IMG_6171_zps92b97789.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://s603.photobucket.com/user/111492KH/media/IMG_6172_zpsb3898304.jpg.html" class="postlink"><img src="http://i603.photobucket.com/albums/tt111/111492KH/IMG_6172_zpsb3898304.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://s603.photobucket.com/user/111492KH/media/IMG_6173_zpse7ce97e5.jpg.html" class="postlink"><img src="http://i603.photobucket.com/albums/tt111/111492KH/IMG_6173_zpse7ce97e5.jpg" alt="Image" /></a> How it looks like on a PowerPak<br /><br /><br />Here's some of my code.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, a proper CRC check should be used.  What I've seen done in commercial games (SNES/SFC titles, however) is that they use a portion of battery-backed SRAM for the actual data, but write it to multiple locations along with a CRC stored with the data.  E.g. $6000-60FD would be your data, with the CRC of all data in $60FE-60FF, then $6100-61FD would be a copy of the same data in $6000-60FD and CRC in $61FE-61FF, etc...<br /><br />This allowed some redundancy in case some of the areas of SRAM had issues, e.g. if CRC for $6000-60FD didn't match, try the next &quot;section&quot;, yadda yadda.  How much redundancy you want is up to you, but I imagine 3 copies would be enough.

I'll try to implement a checksum, but I was also thinking about dropping the save feature since there's not too much data to be saved...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's good to know. On the contrary the Everdrive uses battery backed SRAM which contains the save data until another game is loaded in which case it's copied to the SD card (If you play the same game again the next time you turn on it's never copied though). So I guess holding reset is needed on the Everdrive.<br /><br />What mappers doesn't require holding reset? I remember reading in a Swedish Nintendo magazine that Nintendo worked on a way to protect the save data, but I never heard of a game that used that.
