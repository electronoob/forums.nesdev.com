As for talking regarding apple, this can be done in another thread instead of derailing this one <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />For the code, I was close! That was the other one I found but since I did only a quick 10 minutes search and didn't know about icon per model, I just went with a guess. Thanks for the history class, love those thing!  <br /><br />@Davecom<br /><br />Mesen for now doesn't work with Mono 5 installed from brew. Will continue to test (and update the mesen thread).<br /><br />Edit: <br /><br />I should have known, Tepples created a topic for the naming &quot;issue&quot; <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

It's very possible young readers of the Wiki in a couple years will not know what &quot;OS X&quot; means. &quot;macOS&quot; is the official name and therefore probably what should be used. I'm happy to do a find and replace to fix it on the emulator page but after I created an account I found &quot;You do not have permission to edit pages in the Page namespace.&quot;<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">My point was that a classic Mac user (read: from the 80s) would know how silly it would be to hem and haw over &quot;Mac OS&quot; (with a space) vs. &quot;OS X&quot; vs. &quot;macOS&quot;, and thus, arguing capitalisation and spacing semantics (esp. when most of those emulators were probably from 2016, which during late of was when Apple marketing decided to switch from &quot;OS X&quot; to &quot;macOS&quot;) was sad -- hence, sad Mac.  If a person says &quot;OS X&quot; we know what they mean, if they say &quot;MacOS&quot; when talking about present-day software/Macs, we know what they mean; the pedantry isn't necessary but is funny (to me) since Apple is effectively going back to the original name (sans a space and capitalisation -- again, who cares?) as their System 1 through 9 software.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Super off-topic as mentioned: as for the crash codes shown: it depends on the model of (&quot;classic&quot;) Mac, and *when* the crash/issue happens.  I remember that 0x0F meant an exception error, and that the remaining part of the code (or the code on the 2nd line) represented a detail/state code that was more indicative.  I had to do some digging, but <a href="https://udcf.gla.ac.uk/~gwm1h/Error_Codes/Sad_Mac_Codes.html" class="postlink">here you go</a>.  From that you should be able to discern that the Mac depicted is probably a Mac SE or Mac II indicating code 0x0000000F (exception error), subcode 0x0000000D (SCC failure; SCC = Zilog SIO (serial controller) used for controlling the serial ports).  SCC isn't a new term to me, since the smae chip is on the IIGS (an 8530) -- and I sure hope I'd be familiar with it, considering <a href="https://macgui.com/downloads/?file_id=10042" class="postlink">I wrote a IIGS CDA</a> back in the early 90s called QuickPort II that allowed setting the serial port &gt;19200bps, haha.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since it is a command line based emulator, you should be able to install it with brew.<br /><br />For the wiki, if you could find the information about the macOS emulators and see on which version of the OS they can be run that would really be of great help for the wiki. This would help future users. I had the same issues when I did some programming with a Mac but since I  came from a windows background and knew about the one with debuggers, I just figured out it was faster to just run them under wine. A good native emulator for mac with a debugger would be nice to have, especially performance and UI wise.
