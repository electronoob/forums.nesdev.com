<br />They're treated as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_%28programming%29" class="postlink">overlays</a>, which works nicely for architectures with bankswitching. They're stored consecutively in the ROM, but exported labels within these segments end up overlapping.

<br />BSS segments are usually used for variables. They are in the RAM, and they aren't initialized to any value, so they don't have to be stored in the ROM/the output file.

<br />Where exactly is the RAM then? and how large is it? Why aren't data and rodata segments put in RAM too? They're variables also.

<br />I actually don't know why the linker differentiates between "ro" and "rw", as it's not possible for the compiler to actually check or prevent writing to any segments/memory areas. I think it might be just for checking that the user isn't accidentally putting a "rw" segment in a "ro" memory area.

<br />That would be me. I defend the idea that memory shouldn't be cleared at the start of the program, because it makes cases when parts of the program use uninitialized memory (i.e. bugs) hard to catch. A lot of people don't agree with me though. =)
