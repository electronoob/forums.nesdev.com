<br />
<br />Something similar to that, although much smaller, will happen when you plug a cartridge in while the console is powered up. It will often be innocuous, but certain cases may pose problems. As far as I know, the only extremely likely problem is games with internal saves, which may find themselves becoming amnesiac.
<br />
<br />I would be wary about doing this; hotplug is easy to do wrong, and the NES was never designed for it. It's bad for devices to power them through their signal lines, and NES cartridges don't have longer pins for power and ground (like other hotpluggable things)

<br />
<br />I think it could be a little simpler with these corrections:
<br />
<br />disabled slot:
<br />CPU M2 (tied low for cart) yes
<br />CPU /ROMSEL (tied high for cart) yes
<br />CPU /IRQ (high impedence) yes
<br />PPU /RD (tied high) this is generally /OE not needed if you disable via /CE
<br />PPU /WR (tied high) normally /WE not needed if /CE is switched
<br />CIRAM /CE (tied high) yes unless you never play the few 4screen mirrored games
<br />CIRAM A10 (high impedence) yes
<br />
<br />
<br />You may also want to tie
<br />CPU A14 (low) agree that you can get by without since m2 is disabled
<br />PPU A13 (high) if you switch this you won't have to switch chr /rd and /wr above
<br />PPU /A13 (high) only needed if you wanted to play the few rare games with 4screen mirroring
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />For anyone curious the reasoning behind why you can't just switch power is because the chip can actually be weakly powered through the address and data lines.  Typically done by the internal ESD diodes on most inputs.  So really you don't fully power down the chip by just removing Vcc.
<br />
<br />If I understand your project quentin.lamamy, it seems that is is an AWFUL lot of hardware and circuitry needed to avoid only a small inconvenience.  Also why have separate slots for French and us 72 pin carts?  Your using a single CIClone to disable lockout permanently.  So in effect having separate slots for FR/US carts is the same as having 2 identical 72 pin slots.  Unless your somehow switching from PAL to NTSC.  But since you require no modification to the NES this doesn't seem possible without 2 separate NES units...
<br />
<br />If you wanted to switch ALL 72/60 pins you could use any 5v compadible bus transceiver.  Search that and it should be easy to find on any supplier site.  Keep in mind you might only find fine pitch surface mount solutions.
<br />
<br />And "tied low" means wired to ground.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is the boot cartridge separate from the other two connections?  Or effectively a 'third' cart?
<br />
<br />My advice would be to get the thing working where you can only have one cart in at once.  Then improve it by making the complex circuitry to be able to leave carts plugged in.  If you really have your heart set on allowing both carts to remain plugged in you could maybe allow room in your PCB to break the signals discussed above to make the improvement easier.
<br />
<br />The choice is yours obviously, I only suggest it because it keeps things simple.  Realize the switching circuitry has a HIGH chance to cause problems that are difficult to debug.  I've prevented many headaches I'm sure by starting simple, take small steps towards your end goal.  That way if one step breaks something it's easy to take a step back or two that still work and figure out where you went wrong.

<br />
<br />I'm aware of the difficulty on switching between multiple slot but i know it's possible (look at the Nintendo M82). So let's go for any solution :
<br />
<br />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow" /> If i understand, switch the 72 pin in one time to ground will be the more efficient way to disable a slot. Is there an electronical part that can switch at once 72 channel. It would be really good if this switch can be activated with a +12V or +5V. ( you say that a  bus transceiver can do that ?)
<br />
<br /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow" /> Switching some pin, it seems that it's difficult, and dangerous for the NES
<br />
<br /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow" /> Another idea ?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My suggestion would be to run the signals we discussed above through a bus transceiver.
<br />
<br />No need to switch every single address and data line.  And it's not 'dangerous' it's just addressing.  The NES has several chips on the same bus at once by design like most CPUs.  You just need to switch and control the proper signals correctly.  That's easier said than done though if you're knowledge of the signals is limited.
<br />
<br />Not sure what you mean by "switch the 72 pin in one time to ground will be the more efficient way to disable a slot."  unless I'm miss understanding you that sounds like a bad idea.
<br />
<br />It's hard for us to help you much more than we already have.  At this point your best opportunity for feedback is to draw schematics of what your plan is.  Post them up and we'll help you fix them.

<br />I think that his method can work on less than 72 pin so if you confirm that the list of the pin i need to disable i will follow your advice.
<br />
<br />For the scheme i will post it when it's finished.

<br />
<br />this is what linariq and I did for you above.  I verified that linariq's list is complete and left notes to the side.  Some signals he listed are only needed if your're playing a few select games with 4screen mirroring etc.

Hotplug, as I said, is definitely a whole other issue)
<br />
<br />You could probably cut a few, as infiniteneslives suggested, but since the '157 and '244 switch in groups of 4 at a time, as long as you use those parts it's not clear you'll be able to do better than 1 each '157 and '244, and I personally wouldn't be comfortable with a design that switched the extra 4 lines that INL said you could probably skip.

<br />
<br />Keep in mind proper directions on the signals though.  That's definitely something easy to miss for a novice designing on for the NES.  
<br />
<br />IRQ was already mentioned as being an open collector signal.  So you'll need to prevent the inactive cart from driving the line low.  And you can't drive the line high at any point, you need to leave it floating at all times effectively as the NES sees it.
<br />
<br />All other signal listed are NES -&gt; cart with the exception of two: the CIRAM (VRAM) signals.
<br />
<br />CIRAM A10 and CIRAM /CE are from cart -&gt; NES.  Because these signals are inputs to the memory onboard the NES motherboard.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />How about this:
<br />
<br />Yesterday, I bought a Parallel-Port-Switch and opened it. Pretty sure you know those switches, they were used to switch between parallel-port scanner and parallel-port printer.  They got a massive Switch in front of them (actually, the only fuction they support), and this switch directly switches the 25 (or so) pins from the one imput to the output. There was no PCB inside, the switch does all the work. It's a circular switch I've never seen before, and it looks capable of switching even more pins and/or ports. (this was not clear to me, since all of the 3x25 cables were brown <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> )
<br />
<br />
<br />I have heard rumors, that Scart-Switchboxes got switches for about 20 Pins too. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />
<br />--- 
<br />
<br />If I understand the discussion about right, It should be possible to switch just the mentioned ~10 pins with an allmighty switch, and still have the other pins connected. If you want to make sure, and dont want to corrupt data - why not trigger a reset/power (better: holding reset while powering down) on the NES while switching. maybe an arduino can help you dong that in a nice, timed fashion.
<br />
<br />
<br />... but, as I understand, you now are looking for a  all-72-switch anyway.
<br />
<br />
<br />and your boot-cart:
<br />Dont you think it would be more pretty to remove that boot-cart, and put it inside a "firmware"-rom/chr-Chip. I guess its only function is something very like the m82-"hello/starfield"-screen, and not really needed as dongle/key.
<br />
<br />
<br />kind regards,
<br />ninn, 
<br />who got a spare 12 port Scart-switch that wants to become a m82. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
