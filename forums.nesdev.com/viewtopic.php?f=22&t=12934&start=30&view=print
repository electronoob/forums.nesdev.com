I'd recommend making the icons different in addition to the colors.</div>I never really played much of that game, I was really just trying to think of a cool, easy way to have the level list take up a lot of the screen space while standing out from most/all current NES games.<br />Yeah, I should have the icons different in some way. At the moment the plan is to have a &quot;!&quot; for action levels and a &quot;?&quot; for puzzle levels but I feel like I should come up with something more graphical. Just nothing comes to mind yet. I tried drawing a puzzle piece but it came out crappy.<br /><br />I'm not attempting to make my game realistic at all. I'm just trying to make something fun that's a blend of a lot of games from when I was little, so I'm going to just use whatever tropes I think are fun.<br /><br />The dialog engine already keeps a buffer of the current line and builds onto it before drawing it because of the variable width font, so it wasn't much more effort to make $80 to $ff have special treatment and use <a href="https://github.com/NovaSquirrel/NovaTheSquirrel/blob/master/tools/dictionary.txt" class="postlink">one of 128 &quot;words&quot;</a> to paste multiple characters onto the end instead. I used a list of common English words and kept count of how many times each word was used and how much savings each dictionary entry got me until I wound up with this list.<br /><br />In the dictionary table, the words are just one word after another with bit 7 set for the last character of each word, for maximum savings. When the dialog engine starts, it parses the whole table and builds a table of 128 pointers in RAM. If I wanted to use an extra 256 bytes I could just have a pointer premade in the ROM but RAM is less precious to me for this project.

I'd recommend against relying exclusively on color for three reasons:<br /><ul><li>In the early NES era, some people still had black-and-white TVs. (On a black-and-white TV, $11-$1C looks like $00 and $21-$2C looks like $10.) </li><li>About one in every 12 men has some level of color blindness. Color-blind men can see through camouflage better but have a harder time telling green from red in a video game. </li><li>With the Z80 skills you learned on the TI-83, you may eventually want to port something to the Game Boy, which just has $0B, $1A, $29, and $38. </li></ul>

Probably should have different icons for completed/available but I'll still have to make icons I like first before I see how I'll differentiate them.

Here we have the King from my SMB1 hack from 8 years ago, and Ronald, both taking the place Lakitu usually does.<br /><br />I included a demo with the first four levels. I think they might be getting too hard (like while making level 4 I had to make a health restore block and add some before it felt fair-ish) and I think I should do something about the fast enemy so it doesn't feel super cheap. I recommend just copying a fire ability and just keeping it the whole demo, lol.<br /><br />Honestly most of the game is done at this point aside from needing to design levels and other things, and minor work on other things like the dialog.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Right now, Down+Select removes the current ability (as the sign says, but I should probably reword it to specify exactly <em>what</em> it resets), but I should probably change it to just Select to be more intuitive for people who have played Kirby's Adventure. Most of the enemies in the early levels aren't copyable though, aside from the fire enemies and the volcano.<br /><br />I've been trying to figure out if getting hurt should remove the ability like in Kirby or if the player should just hold onto it because the levels were already hard enough as it is. I went with the latter, but I think I should just make the levels easier, <em>especially for world 1</em>.<br /><br />There's a limit to the number of projectiles you can have active at once, and any past that limit just won't spawn. It might be a good idea to just skip the animation for that if it's not going to work. I should probably also try to always leave room for some projectiles in the objects array.<br /><br />I don't have problems with the running speed myself, though I'm probably just really used to the game.

Also it was unclear to me which enemies I could take powers from; maybe the text should explain that it only applies if the enemy is throwing projectiles? Possibly the &quot;capture&quot; ability could be trying to capture an in-flight projectile, rather than having to stun the enemy? (I catch your hammer and throw it back at you!)<br /><br />The blue enemies that throw water bottles are very tough, especially because there is no pattern to their throws. The stun attack does not stop the bottles (shouldn't it?), and the fire attack falls too quickly to effectively hit them (the water bottles have a lot more range). The only effective attack seems to be using their own weapon against them.<br /><br />(I later noticed your GIF where you were throwing the fire upwards and realized the fire can be thrown up too. That kinda changes everything, but at the same time it makes the water bottle ability redundant to the fire, since the fire can now do everything it does.)<br /><br />Running squirrel can cross gaps that are 2 blocks wide without jumping. (Is this intentional? Looks and feels iffy.)<br /><br />There are parts of levels where you have to stand near the top of the screen, but the squirrel is invisible there.<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

Kind of confusing inconsistency.<br /><br />It seems strange that current weapon gets saved at checkpoints, so if you die you have to recollect it ONLY if you're still on the same level. Kind of unintuitive that you retain your weapon after dying only in some cases, especially since I don't really know what level I'm on while playing (the transitions are kind of immediate, and there's not level indicator).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since I'm showing the game off on <a href="http://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&amp;t=84697" class="postlink">SMWCentral</a> I figured I might as well show off the latest build here to show the project's not dead.<br /><br />Music now plays on lag frames, so there's no more stuttering when moving to another screen vertically.<br /><br />I've made an options screen, where you can choose faster acceleration (which doesn't really feel right to me) or a slower running speed, or double tapping to run (which lets you attack while walking, which is something I got a LOT of requests for) and finally the ability to reset the save.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/60T535A.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/NLwDKv4.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/GyerxkE.png" alt="Image" /><br />I've been drawing more graphics for World 1, going for a tropical theme and a garden/neighborhood theme.<br /><br />I have lots of graphics for World 2 (Bummer Club) but I don't really have mockups because I need to figure out how to put puzzles together. I should do that soon though since World 1 is nearly done.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CJxjO21.gif" alt="Image" /><br />You can use bombs as platforms like in Pocket Bomberman but I feel like I reaaally need to nerf this because it's OP right now. Even if I make it so the explosions hurt you, you can still get up pretty high, which is probably okay. I put bombs in the inventory screen so you can play with them. There's also moving platforms, that can either move horizontally or follow a path.<br /><br />I redid the enemy spawning code, and now there's a priority system where an important sprite like a moving platform can remove a less important sprite to make room if it needs to. Sprites also no longer fail to spawn if they're on the screen you're starting on.
