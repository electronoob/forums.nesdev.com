		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />How many emulators out there emulate the noise floor and/or environmental interference in the audio signal? What about the same problems in the video signal? There are some things that almost universally detract from the experience, while adding nothing of value. Another example that came up with Famitracker: correct emulation of the N163's 8-channel audio is an option most people would not take, given the choice.<br /><br />However, with this particular thing, I don't see any good reason for an accuracy-oriented emulator not to implement this, unless it makes a real impact on CPU demand, which I doubt. It's something that could affect some of us trying to do some very specific timings, and we could benefit from this particular failure case being apparent. It's important to know the real capabilities, limitations, and failure modes of the hardware if you're developing for it.<br /><br />An emulator that is only oriented toward playing games well need not bother, obviously.<br /><br />Ideally all these things are options. In real cases, there may be a unpleasant tradeoff involved in implementing the option, so a judgement call is made based on who/what the emulator is for.

If you set up a Sprite 0 hit on the left side of that pattern in the test ROM, you can use this glitch to detect 1 of the clock alignments on real hardware within a frame, instead of with several seconds of timed loops.

I ought to post a ROM to see whether that works on other NES consoles reliably.

Like BS-Zelda on SNES when it was first hacked, didn't respect the simple VBlank rules of writing VRAM. ZSNES atleast at the time, did not care if a game tried to write VRAM during rendering and it would work just fine. <br /><br />Much older NES emulators and other emulators didn't have the benefits of much more detailed and correct hardware info.
