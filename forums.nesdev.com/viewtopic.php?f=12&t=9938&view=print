From my understanding I just wire the source chip enable line into one pin of the 139 and the other pins into the CE pins of the eproms?  Anything else I need to do?

All other 139 inputs to ground.<br /><br />When you say unlimited speed, does this mean you have found a way to get SFX games to render more frames (game runs smoother but at same speed with less slowdown) or is the SFX still rendering the same frames? (game runs like its in fast forward and technically still slows down at busy points).  I'm guessing that the first case would require access to Argonaut's proprietary SFX assembler software.

I wouldn't say the music is out of sync is still plays when it's supposed to.  And no you don't need super reflexes because the control response is equally as sped up.  Previously there was a delay with the control response in these games now there's no delay.

Otherwise the EPROM is 16-bit. The 29F016 is 16Mbit and 8-bit, so that would be a better choice. And since you'd have to be wiring in the EPROM leg by leg anyway, you wouldn't have to bother getting one of those fancy SNES TSOP adapters, you could just grab a standard <s>32-pin</s> 40-pin TSOP to DIP adapter from eBay or where ever.

I always thought the 27c160 was 16/8bit.  When you pull it's /BYTE line low it goes into 8 bit mode.  I just wire the SNES A0 signal to the 27c160's A-1 line and then all my other address lines to Ax+1 (EPROM A0 to SNES A1, EPROM A19 to SNES A20 etc...)  Ive done that successfully with the 5 projects I have used them in so far.<br /><br />Thanks for pointing out those 29F016s tho, more available than 29F032s.

When the BYTE VPP pin is  at VIL the Byte-wide organization is selected and the Q15A–1 pin is used for the Address Input A–1. When the memory is logically regarded as 16 bit wide, but read in the Byte-wide organization, then with <strong>A–1 at VIL the lower 8 bits of the 16 bit data are selected and with A–1 at V IH the  upper 8 bits of the 16 bit data are selected.</strong></div>

Would it be at all possible you could make a wiring schematic for the 27c160 using this pinout: <img src="http://nintendoallstars.w.interia.pl/romlab/so40fx.gif" alt="Image" /> ?<br /><br />If you're too busy I fully understand.  Also to burn a 27c160 do I need to use an adapter?  I'll check on the datasheet for it right now.<br /><br />If anyone is curious what all this work is for.  Here's stunt race fx running at 50 mhz recorded straight from my snes:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrqGAVmhs2w" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrqGAVmhs2w</a><br /><br />Unfortunately I need to patch the roms to make them run this fast, which is why I need to figure out how to wire up a 16mbit flash / eprom to a doom pcb.

If you can write an emulator for a given CPU, you can write a disassembler. If you can write a disassembler, you can write a macro package to get ca65 or TASM to reassemble the code.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The music is out of sync. No question about that. It's noticeable on short themes when they don't complete. For many or all of these games, they will require reprogramming to actually render more frames rather than just rendering the same frames and displaying them in less time. This is like taking a film which runs at 24 frames per second and speeding up the projector to show 30 frames a second. No new frames are seen but it sure looks faster!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I understand how this is playing the same number of frames at a faster pace, but I don't understand how the argument that the sound is out of sync is relevant. <br />The music doesn't speed up or slow down to finish at the same time you do when your playing on a non modified cart, so why is this necessary for a modded cart? The music wouldn't finish at the same time if you finished the race in 1st place or 5th place because it took you a different amount of time to finish. When you see the sprite cross a time line or pic up an item the sound isn't delayed or at least does not appear to be in these videos. <br />Please explain this argument, for my curiosity and education.<br /><br />Also the comment about needing lightening fast reflexes to play it now, I find irrelevant also. How is this any different to playing Super Mario Bros. with B button held down all the time to playing it without. You play accordingly.
