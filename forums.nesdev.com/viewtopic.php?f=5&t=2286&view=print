So you don't know if you must find a <em>Final Fantasy</em> expert, a <em>Sonic The Hedgehog</em> expert, an anciant african tribal chant (!) expert... whatever! There are molodies everywhere, and while distributing it to a crazy ammount of "experts" you are, in fact, already releasing the music.

<br />
<br />advantages: no file size/quality limits of any kind
<br />disadvantages: no promotion except your own, unlikely to be found in a search (unless you give your stuff a ridiculous filename with common words, which I think is pretty annoying), must have your PC on to upload unless you have a decent fan-base.
<br />
<br />Also, for fun and informational purposes be sure to tag your music files.  So then they'll show up on <a href="http://last.fm/" class="postlink">http://last.fm/</a>
<br />Might be there already, the very few tagged MP3s I've released are.

<br />I think this is almost unavoidable, even if you are a great composer. You'll most likely subconciously plagiarize your own tunes.
<br />
<br />For example, Nobuo Uematsu has done a very similar in the melody of 2-13 (Intension of the earth) from Final Fantasy V, and in 2-19 (Kuja's Theme) from Final Fantasy IX, and also the melody in 1-07 (Main Theme) from Final Fantasy IV has some serious similitude with 2-21 (Ridin Shoopouf), among some others. I bet this is totally unintentionnal from him.
