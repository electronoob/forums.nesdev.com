		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just picked up a powerpak of a local ebay and i wonder if its broken?
<br />
<br />I picked it up to help me with homebrewing.But it seems to have a loading problem.
<br />
<br />Lets start from the beginning.
<br />I downloaded the file from retrousb i unzipped it and it becomes powerpak 134105 .Open that file and see 2 files _macosx and powerpak.
<br />Those files i put on my compact flash card in that order(not unzipping more)+the 8kbsave.sav
<br />
<br />Added some homebrew games in .nes files on the card.
<br />
<br />I put the nes on and i push left or right and i see the _macosx and powerfiles + the nes roms.Pick a game .
<br />Then i push start and im back to the powerpak screen .when i push a or b there is no save file found(wrong input from me)push start again and i get the game genie screen and i can push start to play the game.
<br />(but the bottum screen says play tetris?)
<br />
<br />Anyway.. when i push start the game keeps loading forever.
<br />
<br />Im using a 128 mb compact flash card.
<br />
<br />Did i buy a broken powerpak or am i doing something wrong?

<br />
<br />The card is whipped clean before using and set at 32.
<br />Im using a flash card of 128 mb.
<br />I used 2 flash cards before that of 4k that where 30 mb.
<br />I read in a old nesworld review that the new 4 kb/30mb card could not be used.
<br />
<br />This card is 1 of the nesworld models used so should work.

<br />
<br />Some things to try:
<br /><ul><li>Check that the ROMs' file sizes match the sizes in the header. I've seen loading get hung up when the actual file is smaller or larger than the loader expects based on the header. Do you want me to write a Python program to verify this? </li><li>Make sure that the file system itself doesn't have any inconsistencies. Plug the CF writer into a Windows PC and run chkdsk. </li><li>Back up all files from the CF card to a hard drive, reformat the CF card on a Windows PC, and put the files back. </li></ul>
<br />I recommend Windows because Microsoft has tended to define FAT by how it is implemented in Windows operating systems. (The wording is to the effect "anything on which chkdsk reports no errors is a valid file system".)

<br />
<br />Nope im getting no zeroes ,it tries to load tetris <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> im guesing its from the laast game played on the cart before?
<br />
<br />Im 100% sure im pressing a or b and it says save files not found.
<br />im going to a game with the dpad press a or b and it goes black with the text in white at the bottum.
<br />
<br />ps: would it help to try other software from here instead of the files i downloaded from retrousb?

<br />
<br />
<br />found the problem. I unzipped the nes roms to the core and i had to keep them in there folders.played some homebrew(munchie attack) and some unreleased games and they work fine.Now i can test my own stuff <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />"Bad mapper" may mean your ROMs are corrupted with "DiskDude!" or the like. This will be easy to spot by opening a ROM in the hex editor. There are tools to clean "DiskDude!" garbage from all ROMs.
