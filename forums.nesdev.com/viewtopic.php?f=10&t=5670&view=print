		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi All
<br />
<br />I am new to Nes programming but have been working with various PIC microcontroller based Midi projects and would like to make a NES synth
<br />
<br />What I have in mind is a PIC Microcontroller that encodes received midi into something the nes app can use to trigger sounds
<br />
<br />I am considering using the NES Controller port to write to the APU adresses in 8bit 
<br />
<br />Does this sound like a good approach? 
<br />
<br />All input appreciated!
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />Alex

<br /><a href="http://www.wayfar.net/" class="postlink">http://www.wayfar.net/</a>
<br />
<br />I remember seeing an early prototype of Midines that used the controller port, but later on the design was changed to have the PIC on the cartridge.
<br />
<br />I'm sure it'd be doable just fine through the controller port.  I've played NSFs by sending the register writes over an RS232 adapter to the NES controller port.  If using the port asynchronously though, there are some timing issues with the DPCM channel "stealing" cycles (but it can be overcome).
<br />
<br />If you've seen the thread recently about Miracle piano and stuff like that, you'll see there is at least some interest in a stand-alone MIDI adapter for NES that can work with other carts.  I'd be interested in seeing that also.
<br />
<br />I also had an NES cartridge design including a PIC18F (40-pin DIP).  I had a lot of fun with that and had written a software synth that runs on the PIC.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi Memblers!
<br />
<br />Thanks for your speedy response! It's Midines that triggered the urge to make such a project! 
<br />
<br />Having read about the miracle piano I guess it's even possible to hook up a midi cable to a controller port using an optocoupler but I'm too inexperienced with asm to write Nes a MIDI protocol.
<br />
<br />I'll be using a Powerpack for now so I'll tap my microcontroller directly into a gamepad for 8bit serial communication if this makes sense
<br />
<br />How does one write to a specific bit of a variable on controller strobe?
<br />
<br />Example:
<br />
<br />00101101
<br />
<br />bit1:A
<br />bit2:B
<br />bit3:ST
<br />bit4:SL
<br />bit5:UP
<br />bit6:D
<br />bit7:L
<br />bit8:R
<br />
<br />I was hoping to then use this variable to jump to specific tasks (play sound/ change pitch etc)
<br />
<br />Your pic18f project sounds interesting I would love to hear more about it!
<br />
<br />Thanks
<br />Alex

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had been really curious about trying an MCU on the controller port.  The PIC's SPI slave mode looks usable.  The NES would send and receive at the same time.  NES would write the data out to the strobe, then read $4016 to receieve a bit as well as send the bit on strobe.
<br />
<br />So you'd just need to make a little communication protocol that would contain anything you want.  Could be raw data to write to the NES registers, or something like note, instrument, and effect numbers that the NES program interprets (I think the latter would be better and more open-ended).  Setting up a jump table for up to 128 functions is pretty easy, like this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">address_table:<br />.addr pulse0<br />.addr pulse1<br />.addr triangle<br />.addr noise<br />.addr reg4011<br /><br />&nbsp;lda received_byte ; channel #0...4<br />&nbsp;asl<br />&nbsp;tax<br />&nbsp;lda address_table,x<br />&nbsp;sta addr_lo<br />&nbsp;lda address_table,x<br />&nbsp;sta addr_hi<br />&nbsp;jmp &#40;addr_lo&#41;<br /></div>
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">alkex wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Your pic18f project sounds interesting I would love to hear more about it!<br /></div>
<br />
<br />I started it in 2004, called it the Squeedo project, so if you search for that on the forum it will turn up a lot of references.  The PIC used it's parallel port to communicate with the NES CPU, using a kind of complex system of IRQs with command numbers.  The PIC is pretty much treated as a co-processor.
<br />
<br />There's some misc info, pics, and recordings of the synth here: <a href="http://www.parodius.com/~memblers/nes/squeedo/" class="postlink">http://www.parodius.com/~memblers/nes/squeedo/</a>
<br />I haven't worked on that project in a really long time, but the coming year I will be spending some quality time with it, heh.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks Membler!
<br />
<br />Great I'm going to get started! Further more the Powerpack arrived today so I'm all set.
<br />
<br />it could be interesting to map all the keys and sounds to a special nsf and start it at variable places through the controller port ? ( would make arpeggios, sfx and sequences easier to program)
<br />
<br />Is it possible to jump straight into any position of a NSF or does one have to start at the beginning of the song?
<br />
<br />Thanks
<br />
