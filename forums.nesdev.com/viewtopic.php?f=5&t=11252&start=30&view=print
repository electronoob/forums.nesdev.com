That's what tricking the eye is supposed to do.<br />But when was there ever: &quot;We draw something into the animation that can only be seen in slow motion. And the thing is <em>not</em> supposed to actually be there, so what we're actually drawing doesn't count for the plot&quot;?<br /><br />If Disney animators sneak a picture of a nude woman into one of the windows of a house, it might not be noticeable with the bare eyes. But the thing that it was included means that it is there.<br /><br />Especially when it's the other way around, like in &quot;Super Mario World&quot;: When you have a <em>controversial</em> theory, but closer inspection reveals that the controversial thing doesn't hold up and the scene is ultimately harmless, you cannot say that the controversial, out-of-character thing is still canonically supposed to exist in that scene.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I think i agree with Bregalad. It's not about any specific frame. It's about the change and movement between frames during playback and how they are percieved on average.</div><br />If there's a piece of animation that obviously disproves that this was intended the way fans speculate, then you cannot say we have to ignore this frame because people wouldn't notice it.<br /><br />I mean, seriously, do people really think they intended Mario to be such a dick as to punch Yoshi on the head? Really? That's what they had in mind? That's what fans believe? That Nintendo consciously made Mario punch Yoshi without any reason at all? (Don't forget that Yoshi is not like a simple horse who can be controlled by whipping and by spores. He's designed as a sentinent, intelligent being who can write notes on his mailbox and who can talk to you. Punching him to make him do stuff would not fit with the story anyway.)<br /><br />The in-game animations disprove it.<br /><br />Mario's hand is consciously <em>not</em> drawn like this regular fist, but with a gap in the outlines that seems to imply a finger.<br /><br />And the official artwork couldn't be any clearer:<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<br />
	</div><br />Those are three clear proofs. And what does the other side have? Those stupid fan theories and now another piece of bullshit statement from the developers that are known to lie or forget stuff.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the same guy said that Mario riding Yoshi was an idea that originated during the time of SMB3 and it originated as the idea of Mario riding a horse, then a lizard, then a dinosaur. But on the other hand, we have concept art from the time of SMB1 that already has Mario riding a dinosaur whose head and neck look pretty much like Yoshi. <em>That's</em> where the idea comes from. So, his trivia about getting the inspiration from a drawing about Mario riding a horse and later coming up with a dinosaur <em>cannot</em> be true.<br /><br />Likewise, I doubt his story about Mario punching Yoshi. <em>Maybe</em> it was an original thought of him that was immediately rejected by the higher-ups. This might be the sliver of truth to that story. But this doesn't mean that Mario punching Yoshi is now somehow confirmed.<br /><br />My graphics artist suggested that if Amy attacks Rachel, the girl that gives you an item in my game, with her taser, that Rachel lets the item fall and it's lost.<br />I immediately shot this down because Amy would never do this and I don't want the player to be able to let Amy act out of character by consciously including an event that would never happen in the story.<br />And now imagine an interview with my artist titled: &quot;Confirmed: Amy attacks Rachel with a taser.&quot;<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">However, the animation as a whole still looks like Mario is punching Yoshi</div><br />Well, how would Mario pointing towards something and Yoshi reaching out to it have to look like then?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">This doesn't prove anything... Synchronization errors in object animations happen all the time.</div><br />Yeah, let's just assume that Nintendo included a big out-of-character moment for Mario <em>and</em> screwed-up the animation <em>and</em> forgot to close his fist, so that it looks like a pixel of a finger <em>and</em> forgot to tell the artist about it. That's of course <em>much</em> more probable than simply assuming that Mario punching Yoshi is <em>fucking bullshit</em>.

Because it kind of does and because it's the kids' version of physical comedy and comedy toying with moral norms. <br />-A meme (in the sociological sense) is formed from a lot of kids having the same experience.<br />-It finally distorts potentially influential and/or authoritative peoples' memory of what happened.<br />-Someone who was hired at nintendo states said distorted memory as truth.

Frame number 4 shows Mario's arm strechted out next to Yoshi's head.<br /><br />This either proves that they did a major screw-up by miscalculating one frame and putting the arm and the head in the same location, even though the arm is supposed to punch the head and move it downwards.<br />(Furthermore, they would have done another screw-up because Yoshi already uses his tongue when his head is still in the normal position, even though the tongue coming out is supposedly the result of Mario hitting his head.)<br /><br />Or it proves that the next frame cannot mean that Mario punched Yoshi's head since the arm is supposed to be next to the head, not directly above of it. Therefore, in the last frame it only <em>appears</em> as if the fist hit the head because their y position seems to match up for such a scene.<br /><br />It's the other people who take this frame out of context and claim that Mario hits Yoshi, not me.

The limit of 64 sprite pixels per scanline (25% coverage) is another. A horizontal tongue drawn as sprites would have caused suspicious flicker on any mapper. If Yoshi is to use his tongue in mid-air, the cartridge would need some sort of compositor coprocessor to render the tongue as background. And by the time that became practical on a cartridge, the Super Famicom was already being designed with over four times the sprite coverage.

As of now, all we're talking about is the NES' capability of making Mario ride a dinosaur, nothing more.<br /><br />Would you have to cut other parts from the game if you implemented this? Absolutely.<br /><br />Is it a &quot;hardware limitation&quot;? Definitely not.<br /><br />Unless you also count &quot;not having a separate sprite for Luigi&quot; as &quot;hardware limitation&quot; in the way that the NES only supports 256 sprite tiles and another Luigi sprite would have required more graphics. But in this case, <em>everything</em> is a &quot;hardware limitation&quot;:<br /><br />The score only having six digits instead of 10? &quot;Hardware limitation.&quot; (The NES has a resolution of 256 pixels, so there's a limit on how much you can display in the status bar if you also want to fit other information.)<br /><br />The soundtrack consisting of several looping parts? Hardware limitation. (Because composing more sounds would have required more ROM space.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't see the need to defend your position so energically since almost everyone seems to agree on it. It wasn't intended for Mario to punch Yoshi, but they screwed up the graphics and it looked like he punched Yoshi. Case closed. There's no need to discuss this further.<br /><br />For &quot;hardware limitation&quot;, as you noted yourself, it's a pretty void and meaningless word intented for people who don't understand the working mechanism of a gaming console and how games works internally.<br /><br />Doesn't some NES game like &quot;Mario's Missing&quot; have Luigi riding Yoshi on the NES ? That would easily disprove the &quot;hardware limitation&quot; thing, even for people with no knownledge of NES hardware.<br /><br />The real limitation here is the 8-sprites per line, I guess a Mario riding a Yoshi would already take at least 5 if not 6; that's A LOT and only one enemy would be allowed on the same line before flickering appears. Because SMB games are usually horizontall driven that would typically mean only one enemy on the screen at the time where Yoshi is there.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">This effect may even be intentional in some cases. In traditional animation, much like in video games, there are usually less actual drawings than frames per second, so alternating the animations of characters in the same scene is a cheap way to improve the overall perception of smoothness, because something will change every frame.</div><br />In both traditional animation and video game animation, the &quot;proper&quot; way to limit the FPS is to filter the frames that would be there and blend them together, usually by the mean of motion lines (or equivalent). Ideally, what is shown on screen during an animation is what it would be if a picture was taken during the whole time those frames were in place, and as such, the moving parts are supposed to be intentionally blurry. Lack of doing so creates a time-aliasing in the motion.<br /><br />The result is that, when an animation is &quot;properly&quot; drawn, the animation's frame does NOT look like still frames. However, it doesn't seem like SMW had high quality enough graphics to use any motion lines (or equivalent).

Many pirates also deliberately ignored the sprites-per-scanline limit when porting some popular 16-bit games to the NES, and to be honest, in most cases, the flickering was hardly the worst problem with these games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I read in an interview in an old magazine (Super Power) during the SNES era where Miyamoto clearly said that he gave Mario a cap because he wasn't confident in drawing hair. It sounded like the cap was a design decision to make things easier for himself. Although it wasn't clear if he was talking about the concept art or the sprite graphics (the interview came with pictures of early concept art which made me initially interpret it as it was about the concept art). I guess this eventually somehow turned into the &quot;hardware didn't allow animated hair&quot; misinterpretation which is of course either BS or badly phrased sentences.<br /><br />The moustache and overalls are probably about the sprite graphics though as it possibly made him stand out more with such limited resolution. So I think it could be said it's about techniques to make art despite the hardware constraints, rather than incapable hardware.
