If so, you could hack the ROM to replace the $0D palette entries with $0F and see if that fixes it.<br /><br />I don't know why it would be different on the original cart.  I had often seen glitches when running games on the PowerPak, but it normally only affected a single scanline at a time, and hasn't happened in a predictable way that I've seen.</div>
<br />
<br />How can i do that. i know how to use hex edit. i used hex edit in the past to hack several emulators speed with handheld
<br />
<br />i search 0D  , im am still not sure what to do with it

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To hack a palette, you need to find where it is stored in the ROM.  The easiest way is to use an emulator that lets you view the palette while the game is running (not only the colors, but the actual byte values).
<br />
<br />So if the first 4 bytes of the palette are $0D,$10,$15,$2B (just random numbers for example), use the hex editor to search for that pattern in the ROM.  Various games could be different, but <em>normally</em> you would expect to find a bunch of sets of 4 colors, in a format like: background color, byte 1, byte 2, byte 3.  Find that pattern, and hex edit it.  But the different palette sets could be scattered throughout the ROM also, or may be stored in reverse order, it just depends on the program.

<br />
<br />dont forget i only get that problem with my CRT TV not on a LCD TV.
<br />
<br />Still my CRT TV work perfect and its a expensive model of the time.
<br />great image quality.  no blur with 2d games <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  i cant play 2d games with a LCD too much blur in action

<br />
<br />Micro machines at first race is worst. the screen completly go up until i see it appear at the bottom, it did that very often during first race.
<br />
<br />about Big nose the caveman, the screen problem happen when you dont touch any buttons. the intro have the screen problem. i just notice it some hours ago. Anyway the patched roms made by Loopy is 100% perfect working order.
