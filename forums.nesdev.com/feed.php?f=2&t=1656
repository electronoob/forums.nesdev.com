I started reading it after I'd been in China a total of about a year and a half, so it did a good job of filling in things I was wondering about.  I can understand maybe you'd be more concerned about taking something 70 years old and using it as your sole guide to the country :)  Personally, I actually wasn't going to read the book until I saw the old date on it, because I worried that a newer book would have too much of an agenda.  Maybe there's a good new book out there somewhere.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=278">augnober</a> — Tue Jun 20, 2006 12:33 am</p><hr />

It was written in 1935 by a Chinese guy who was asked by an American author to explain Chinese culture to foreigners.  I happened to read it before watching the "A Chinese Ghost Story" (倩女幽魂) series.. and was grateful because I would have missed a lot if I hadn't.  Rather than get too off-topic.. you could check a review here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9971642050/103-1510057-1089402?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="postlink">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9971642050/103-1510057-1089402?v=glance&amp;n=283155</a><br /><br />I got mine from the "Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press" in China after a recommendation from a Chinese friend.  I don't know where else you can get it.  There seem to be a few used copies on Amazon.
