So we've determined that it takes art to back up complexity, and even if a working engine demo posted on the right forum attracts artists we need some sort of seed contribution to get the engine started. But one of the reasons I'm not taking the easy way to art is that plenty of fan games have been cease-and-desisted. Case in point: Chrono Trigger Resurrection. I fear what Sega might do to tokumaru's project.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Tue Jan 12, 2010 4:57 am</p><hr />

A double post, I didn't even realize Tokumaru got in before me.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />You don't make retro games for other people (or at least you shouldn't) you make them for yourself. It's a hobby you picked and willingly chose to do it during your free time. If it feels so much like torture that you have to charge people to compensate for that, maybe you should pick a better hobby.<br /></div><br /><br />Heh. I've got a lot of hobbies. See my animations in the art topic. I'm not making this game FOR other people. It's still very self indulgent. It's just that the money is a motivating factor, beyond the joy of making of retro games. And it's just enough to push me to REALLY cool/complex stuff. Simply stated without the profit factor I'd still do it, I'd just do less complex things.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Like I said before, I probably haven't completed a game yet because of laziness or overall lack of motivation, those are the issues I have to resolve, not the complexity of the game, I'm sure.<br /></div><br /><br />That's where I was. The money motivates me to keep working on something complex. But it is not the WHOLE reason beyond why I do what I do. Otherwise I'd make a game for say... PC. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />You won't be able to feed your family with this money, but it should still serve as incentive for you to keep going.<br /></div><br /><br />Indeed. That's exactly what I'm sayin' it's doing for me.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I'm far from being the most righteous person on earth, but I simply can't see myself releasing a purely commercial retro game when I download hundreds of old games for free, that's hypocrisy.<br /></div><br /><br />That's fair, man, and I understand that. But I'm one of those guys who goes to a retro game store near me every chance he gets to buy retro stuff. And I now own many games I would never have heard of it had it not been for such dark practices. It's just a shame that even when I buy a game used, the copyright holder still doesn't make any money. Owning a real copy vs owning a pirated copy of old games like this... isn't very different. The only right way to do it is buy stuff off the virtual console if it's even ON THERE. Which you have to admit is VERY different (BTW, I smell a split too) from me pirating any of Sivak's games, since there is still a way for the original copyright holder to make money off my purchase of the game, and I opted out. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />And you simply can't stop piracy. If there is a demand, eventually there will be a ROM of your game floating around. I don't know how common they are, because I've never looked for pirate versions of homebrew games (yet at least), partially because of complete lack of interest (simple puzzle games) and partially because of minimal respect towards the programmer (the few games that actually got me interested), even though I doubt they haven't pirated several commercial games themselves.<br /></div><br /><br />Hmm... So I should never make anything that can be pirated? Cool, let's have everyone work at McDonald's and WalMart and call centers. Let's never make any cool software with a price tag attached, because everyone will just steal it! I shouldn't write a book? Or make a painting? Write a manga, etc, just bcause it can be pirated? I imagine a rom will be floating around of my game, and yeah, there's little I can do about it. But as I said the cash isn't the ONLY reason I'm doing this, and heck perhaps it's an optimistic outlook, but some people might pirate and like it enough to buy it. It HAS happened before.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Also, some programmers come off as selfish in my opinion, because they show up here, and we do everything we can to help them out, and once they are good enough to make nice games they don't give anything back, they just sell something they could only do because they got free help, free documents, free tools... Ironic, isn't it?<br /></div><br /><br />That's a fair assessment. In fact, I'm sure I'll be considered in this way. I try to give back when I can though, and in fact I'm currently teaching a friend of mine to make NES games for free. (Which takes a lot of my time.) Maybe... though... that's not quite giving back to this specific community. But I'm passing on the knowledge. Honestly, I try to help out on this forum whenever I can, but a lot of questions go over my head. I'm actually pretty bad at this whole programming thing and the only reason I get anywhere is sheer stubborn dedication. And having the repropak out there helps this dedication.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Mon Jan 11, 2010 5:44 pm</p><hr />

Post Edited: Forgot to mention how I planned to transition from day to night in the NES Animal Crossing.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />As long as there's some sort of free demo, it's fine.<br /></div><br /><br />Indeed there will be one.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Go ahead and fork LJ65 if you want.

Have you read <a href="http://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=Animal_Crossing_%28NES_game%29" class="postlink">my analysis of cloning AC</a><br /></div>Writing letters is a problem I likely could not solve, and I didn't really give a lot of thought to it. Writing letters was never a huge part of the game for me. I'm not a person who needs EVERY aspect from the original, especially considering these limitations. My Geometry Wars clone left out the black hole things for instance, since calculating their pull on every single object would be very CPU intensive, or hacky if I went the quick route. The game already lags with 45 sprites getting shot at. <br /><br />As for the clock, I planned to give a user the following options when they first started the game. Play by Season/Month (It'd probably end up as month), play by day, or play by clock. If they chose play by month, every time they started the game, they would be able to choose a month, with the default month selected being the last one played. So if they were playing and it was the same month they need only press A to start. Otherwise, they'd just advance one month. After that it would ask the player if it's early morning, morning, afternoon, or night. And it would transition to later in the day based on some arbitrary unit of time that I haven't decided yet. (Maybe an hour or two? Shorter than it'd be in real life. Or I could just have it remember how much time has passed in the current "block" of day so it could transition by a real time value by adding to whatever it was last.)<br /><br />Play by day makes the assumption that every time the user starts the game a new day has started. (Last load was December 31st in game, so now it's January 1st) Of course the user could always correct the clock when this is not the case. Or... they could just let the game keep track of its own days and play away from real world time. After that it would ask the player if it's early morning, morning, afternoon, or night. It would again, transition the day after some amount of time has passed.<br /><br />Play by time makes the user set the exact day and time each time they want to play, with the default time being what it was last time the game was loaded. I really doubt anyone would use this, but I'd implement it anyway. As for the fish/bugs that come out in REALLY specific times, I'd simply make it a little more general. Holidays could be reported (in play by month) to the user as X days away where X is the number of times they must load the game in the same month to trigger the holiday. Another plan I had was to use special registers for people that played on emulator, that emulator author's could implement to let the game read from the user's system clock. Many emulator authors wouldn't do it anyway, so this is how I'd do the clock.<br /><br />Edit: Indeed managing the limited SRAM seems daunting, but I wouldn't have picked this project up because it was easy. I'd rather manage RAM than CPU cycles which is what I'm doing now.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Mon Jan 11, 2010 5:04 pm</p><hr />

That's why I work alone, and also why I like to keep my development projects under my hat until they're basically completely done. I don't like getting people's hopes up for a game that will never be completed. The game I'm working on now (which I plan to sell if completed, sorry guys. I've given one game for free) will likely never see the light of day. So I do my best to never mention anything specific about it. <br /><br />Slightly more on topic, I understand Tepples' concerns. As my game stands now, no one would probably play it if they loaded it up and saw its graphics. I can make pretty good sprites, but I'm really having trouble coming up with pretty backgrounds that look like what they're supposed to be. So right now my game is stuck in a minimal world, not unlike N+ which is not a bad thing, though I'd really love to have some colorful backgrounds like Kirby's Adventure. And... I need music too...<br /><br />I hope this doesn't demand another split, but it has been brought up a little. This discussion makes me think of all the hate makers of complex games will get for wanting to sell their work when the time comes. I'm fine giving a game away for free when I've worked ~4 months on it, at a leisurely pace. My current game has taken up nearly all of my free time and probably will for a long time after this post. Naturally this is just how I feel, but the more complex a game of mine gets, the more hours I put into it, the less likely it is that the community will be able to enjoy it for free. Is that wrong?<br /><br />In some ways, the eventual sale of this game is a motivating factor for me to actually finish this "complex" game. Even if I know I won't make a lot of money off a simple NES game unless I find a way to get it up on XBLA, or Wiiware, or whatever the heck PS3 calls its thing for cheap. If I knew I wasn't going to get a dime, I'd make a Tetris The Grand Master 3 clone (not a shot at Tepples, I would seriously LOVE to do this if I didn't have my current game to work on), or a Rubik's cube game. I thought of a great control scheme to rotate the cube, even. I'd also love to clone a bunch of other games like Schizoid, or Animal Crossing. (Got a plan for that too, but it'd take me years longer than if I was gonna sell it.) I do like programming in assembly as a hobby, but without something beyond that to motivate me, I'd be making simple games that are enjoyable to work on, and also give me less headaches, like a lot of other people. In fact, I'm quite sure if the repropak didn't exist I would not have even started planning my current project.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Mon Jan 11, 2010 4:18 pm</p><hr />

Looking at my own situation, knowing my project as I do, I'm absolute sure that if every day I managed to work at least 1 hour on my game, it would have been finished a long time ago.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Another factor is my own laziness.

There isn't a single day that I don't use the computer for more than 1 hour (except when I'm on vacation, but that doesn't happen so often), but I can go for weeks without being able to code anything. It's like a programmer's block, I just can't do it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Excuse me but it sounds like you are saying sivak has achieved something extraordinary and is our hero.<br /></div><br />He's surely no hero, but his merit is that he seems to be handling this hobby much better than the rest of us, even the oldbies. His latest game got a lot of attention, specially from people that don't code because they don't care about how complex a game is inside, they can simply see that it's a more advanced game than most homebrews, so it stands out. Sivak became some sort of icon because he's putting some unique games out, and this is what all of us should be doing.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Celius wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I do agree with tokumaru about puzzle games getting old.

The other is making simple programs (not interesting to anyone else) to get acquainted with the hardware. I already knew a lot about game programming when I decided to work with the NES, so I had no interest in making simplistic games just to get to know the platform, it would be a waste of half of my time (the half spent on coding the straightforward game logic), so I made a number of small programs to study the hardware instead.<br /><br />So here I am, still working on my complex game. I probably wouldn't have finished a simplistic game either, because there would be no motivation at all. Like I said before, I probably haven't completed a game yet because of laziness or overall lack of motivation, those are the issues I have to resolve, not the complexity of the game, I'm sure.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Jan 11, 2010 3:15 pm</p><hr />

Artists have a <em>very</em> good reason to be skittish about committing to a hobby game project.  Look at how many projects have started, compared to how many have finished.. in this case, include everyone's unreleased and unmentioned game projects..   I'd guess 1 in 10 making it to completion is a very optimistic view.  And after contributing, it's no longer under your control.  Sounds like a ticket to nowhere, to me.<br /><br />Before I knew how to program, I was writing music for a couple different games people were writing in '96 or so.  It was a lot of fun, maybe it helped things along, but none if it resulted in a game being created.  It wasn't until Solar Wars that I made something that was actually used in a game, and I was writing (really bad) programs myself by that time.  Also I've worked with artists like Tootai, who've put time into projects I've worked on that haven't been finished.<br /><br />While the graphics do inspire development, and really bring the program to life, it doesn't make an ambitious game project any less of a monumental task.  I guess this makes a pretty good case for placeholders.. something I don't often do enough of myself.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Jan 11, 2010 1:53 pm</p><hr />

I suppose some people don't care about certain fields in life or appreciate them. For example, lots of people appreciate the art of dancing. I personally think it is really stupid. I have absolutely -no- interest in that field. I mean zero. I just find it strange that people wouldn't want to know how to draw, or compose music. But I guess some people are just not interested in it like I'm not interested in dancing. And if you're not interested in it, then you don't have to learn about it. But I just don't like to hear people say "I wish I knew how to draw but I'm not going to do anything about it" when they can at least try and get better at it. But I guess it requires some motivation and dedication, which some people might not have...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Mon Jan 11, 2010 11:58 am</p><hr />
