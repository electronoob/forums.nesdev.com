		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What NES games had the best instruments, using <em>only</em> the APU's native sound?
<br />
<br />Wagland Land 3's square wave instruments sound really nice, especially with the assistance of the triangle and DPCM channels - but even without them, they sound pretty good.
<br />
<br />Some of Rare's games like to mix both squares and the triangle for a single instrument, including Ironsword: Wizards and Warriors II and Jordan vs. Bird.  While it doesn't sound very well executed in the latter, Ironsword's instruments are much better executed and sound very nice.
<br />
<br />Metal Slader Glory's instruments also sound good too, even for the songs that don't use the MMC5's squares.  In fact, I think only two songs in the game use the MMC5's squares.  It also uses the two-square+triangle technique at times for a guitar during the alien-robot-fighting song and a cheerful, happy instrument during the password song.
<br />
<br />Sweet Home also has good instruments IMO, and also uses the two-square+triangle method for an interesting, haunting instrument during the intro and ending song.
<br />
<br />What are other NES games that have good instruments, using only the APU's sound?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Snake's Revenge and Castlevania II have Konami's signature instruments where a pulse wave's duty is momentarily changed at the start of the note, and of course their drum tracks were intense. Fester's Quest has good DMC bassline samples for the overworld theme. Lolo 3 has a nice wood drum sounding percussion track. Solstice makes unique use of the noise channel for a metallic triangle sample, which is interesting to listen to. Blaster Master just gets many things right, really classy instruments. The drum samples momentarily play a higher triangle wave note at the beginning of the noise burst, and the two meld together so you can hardly tell it's the triangle channel.

<br />You mean like when you select a missile in Top Gun?
<br />
<br />Klax does some really weird effects with some of its instruments.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm very sursprised Final Fantasy 3 hasn't been mentionned yet, it uses awesome instruments.
<br />Aside of this, I guess Double Dragon 2 has a cool effect on the start of the music of the first stage, combining Square+Triangle at different octaves to get a cool effect. The Stage 2's music in Castlevania does something similar.
<br />Just Breed also does impressive instrument combinations at times, but it doesn't always sounds good.
<br />
<br />Yet, there is still many possibilities to try ! I like how so little wave generators can produce so very different sound effects, it's something really awesome.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Most of the time when I think of games that sounded really good, I also look at what images they are put to. Like the way the music goes really well in the Ninja Gaiden cinema screens.
<br />
<br />Speaking of the Double Dragon games, Double Dragon III really sticks in my head in this regard. The music really captures each setting that you're playing in. I especially like in the last level when it's an Egyptian setting, and they were able to come up with songs that still kept the oriental feel of the game, along with capturing a middle-east, mysterious kind of feel in the music. All APU too : )

<br />Oh, yes... Batman Return of the Joker and Hebereke are good examples.

<br />
<br />Conquest of the Crystal Palace have some good instruments that really sounds like Chineese instruments.
<br />The FDS version of Castlevania II also have awesome instruments that sounds like celtic instruments, but this is greatly due to a clever combination of FDS sound and regular NES sound.
