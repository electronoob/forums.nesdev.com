		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />While there are still a few things I want to add and fix (like a reward for 100%ing the game, and a few minor bugs) the game has been ready for at least a few days now, and the soundtrack is completely finished. However, I've been having problems with getting the soundtrack into the game. I fixed a bug in ft2pently regarding vibrato (some missing <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">break;</tt> statements caused vibrato to always be full strength), but I get problems that randomly change every time I run pentlyas on the output that don't seem like they'd be caused by anything in the output.<br /><br />I'm not really sure how I should proceed; I've spent today trying to figure out what's going on, but I haven't really been able to. I think there might be a bug in Pently, as I'm well below its limits so it shouldn't be messing up. Using a different music engine doesn't seem like an easy solution because the soundtrack uses vibrato, arpeggios, the limited volume column, and duty envelopes, and I don't know of any other music engines with those features. I think I remember a version of the Famitracker music engine with sound effects added in, that could probably work as a temporary solution, but I wasn't able to find it.<br /><br />I hope to get the game out soon. Worst case scenario, I ship the initial version without sound effects, or without music, but I'd really rather not.

Anything that uses hash values in Python, such as the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">dict</tt> (unordered map) type, could potentially have different results every time a program is run. Hash randomization, which was <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html" class="postlink">introduced in Python 3.3</a>, is a measure to make <a href="http://ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2011-003.html" class="postlink">denial-of-service attacks on unordered maps</a> less likely.<br /><br />I would like to help you troubleshoot the defect leading to this unpredictable behavior. Can you contact me about providing the problematic score?

The symptoms are that specific, random patterns will play completely incorrectly in a very noticeable way, and every use of the affected patterns sound incorrect. I already checked to see if it's mishandling &gt;128 patterns and it seems to already have a check for that?

Congratulations! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />I particularily like the drive to experiment with absorbing different abilities and try them out on different situations,, and that that the abilities do have variations built into the control scheme. Also that being without an 'extra' ability still gives you a pretty versatile move anyway.

That's partly why I made sure that shooting after you've maxed out the number of &quot;special&quot; ability projectiles on screen should result in a star, since it's still useful.
