<br />This question could be not on topic but I would like to know if that emulator had issues while trying to set it in full screen mode? 
<br />
<br />I was trying to test it in full screen and it never worked properly. Was it working before or it was always like that?

<br />
<br />ok. Hmmm... Could be my settings then.  I tried to be in full screen mode but  it was not working 100%.  Since I have to write some japanese, I always have the IME active. The IME was always on top and some other windows too.
<br />
<br />I was playing with the code just to see if I could have done some kind of screen saver out of it (message from another thread, I find the idea cool I would love to have one). 
<br />
<br />Right now I'm blocking with the direct-x code so I don't know if it's the way they made it that make the IME shows or not.  I may decide to try to do that screen saver project some day with another emulator if I can't find the solution. 
<br />
<br />For now that's a very low priority project so I don't mind much <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Thanks for the info.
