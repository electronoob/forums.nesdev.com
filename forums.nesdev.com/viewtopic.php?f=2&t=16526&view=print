I'm talking about a good way to transform one color into another one.<br /><br />Let's say I have color $05 in one screen and color $2A in the next. And I want to change one color into the other one with two steps in between. But I don't want to build a manual lookup array of every single color tranforming into every other color.<br /><br />Is there some automatism I can apply here?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You should separate the palette entry between the &quot;hue&quot; (low nybble) and &quot;luminousity&quot; (high nybble) components, and slide those separatedly. Luminosity is the easier, since you just add or substract one, until you get to the number you want.<br /><br />Hue is a bit more complicated, but doable. The &quot;lazy&quot; way is to simply add one until you get the number you want, if you attain the $0d column reset to the $01 column. But this can take a long time as you might rotate through the entiere palette doing this. So in order to be quicker, you'd want to compute the &quot;distance&quot; between the hues, and go either left (+$01) or right (-$01) through the palette columns, taking the shorter path. In the worst case where the hue difference is 6, the distance is the same in either direction. In the case either the start or target column is $00 it's a special case because you have to jump in our out of this column at some point. Similarly, the colour black $0f is a special case.<br /><br />The effect as a whole can have a duration up to 6 steps, but you'll have to find a way to stay at the target hue and/or saturation once you reach them, just like you can stay to black when fading the palette out.

If you still need those colours with the effect, you'll have to handle the cases individually and code them as special cases.<br /><br />Another way would be to have your own luminosity that extends the NES luminosity, for example it accepts values 0 to 5, but when display it you convert it to NES palette, for instance $0x always convert to $0f, $1x converts to $0x, and so forth until $4x which converts to $3x, and eventually $5x which converts to $30.<br /><br />That still doesn't solve the problem of jumping to and from the gray column, but at least it allows easily fading to and from black, as well as to and from white, using the normal algorithm, but you just have to convert your palette colour before displaying it.<br /><br />Using the same concept you could extend this and have a full HSL palette internally, do a gradual change there and &quot;convert&quot; it to NES palette before displaying, however I do think it's overkill. But if you really need smooth transitions and you need support for all colours including black, whites and grays, this is the most appropriate solution.<br />Something like this pseudocode to convert from HSL to nearest NES palette colour.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br />convert_HSL_to_NES(H, S, L):<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;if L == L_MAX :<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return $30<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;elseif L == 0 :<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return $0f<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;else if S &lt; SAT_MAX :<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return (L*3/L_MAX) &lt;&lt; 4<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;else :<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hue = 12*H/H_MAX + 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lum = 4*l/L_MAX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return lum &lt;&lt; 4 + hue&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /></div>

Actually programming it is not an issue.<br /><br />I don't think I'll have some kind of internal abstract palette. I'll simply invent something for the grey values.

This one is pretty obvious.<br /><br />The question is just: <em>How</em> could we treat transformation from and to the grayscale values?<br /><br />Brightness is simple: Conversion from one brightness to another is done as if black was actually color $00, white $30 and gray $10 and $20 instead of the constellation that they have in the moment.<br /><br />But how do I gradually transform black into a specific green? Or gray into orange?

This means you can go through the gray of roughly the same brightness. For example, for $22 to $28, use $22, $10, $28.
