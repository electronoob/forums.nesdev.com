		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Having quite a bit of trouble getting good, clean sound out of my PSG emulation.<br />All of the documentation I can find on the chip is <em>extremely</em> barebones and high level.<br />The best public source of info I know of is: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.magicengine.com/mkit/doc_hard_psg.html">http://www.magicengine.com/mkit/doc_hard_psg.html</a><!-- m --><br />pcetext.txt barely covers that the PSG even exists.<br /><br />My current emulation source code is here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://hastebin.com/raw/fagecaxano">https://hastebin.com/raw/fagecaxano</a><!-- m --><br /><br />(Note that I'm emulating sound output at the full ~3.57MHz, and then using a sixth-order biquad IIR butterworth filter to remove aliasing prior to using hermite to resample the audio to the native PC sound card rate.)<br /><br />But I'm stuck on lots of points. Is anyone here knowledgable with this chip that could lend a hand?<br /><br />Right now, I support waveform mode, direct D/A mode, and noise generation mode. However for noise, I'm not actually generating a proper square wave, and I don't know the PRNG algorithm used for choosing the random values. So for now, I'm just feeding in random values to it.<br /><br />I'm also not sure about the noise mode's frequency counter. Magic Kit is implying it's 64*~frequency, but that results in an 11-bit period. It seems only logical that we'd want a 12-bit period. So my guess is that it's actually 12-bit, and halfway through it alternates between two randomly generated values every 32 samples, and the two values are generated every time the period hits zero.<br /><br />Next up, it's not clear when the period counter is reloaded, either for the waveform or the noise mode. So for now, when enabling the channel, I reload the waveform period. And when enabling noise mode, I reload the noise period. I don't know if you need to do it when writing to the frequency registers or not.<br /><br />Next, it's not clear whether the period is a decrement-and-compare, or a compare-and-decrement, and whether we reload with frequency, frequency-1, or frequency+1. There's this cryptic note in pcetext.txt:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;- The PSG channel frequency is 12 bits, $001 is the highest frequency,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;$FFF is the next to lowest frequency, and $000 is the lowest frequency.</div><br />As best I can tell, he's trying to say that it's decrement-and-compare.<br /><br />Whatever the case, there's periodic popping noises every few seconds. I thought it might be because this is the first system with a fractional sampling rate (~3.57MHz), but rounding the frequency to a whole number doesn't help at all, and emulator/audio should be able to handle fractional resampling rates anyway.<br /><br />The popping noises could also be due to PSG writes being cycle-timed, and my HuC6280 cycle timings not being very great yet. The PSG has no kind of interrupts, so I think careful timing is the only way to do certain things, especially D/A mode.<br /><br />Next up, I really don't understand the frequency modulation mode at all. It also has a frequency value that we'll need to understand how the period works and reloads. Basic idea though is the channel 1 output turns into a value to modulate channel 0's frequency by, and channel 1's output gets muted. But how does one turn that idea into code? All kinds of subtleties abound.<br /><br />Next up, I don't know how the volume controls work at all. There's a master volume left+right, per-channel volume left+right, and per-channel overall volume. The documentation lists their effects in terms of decibels. I have no clue how to turn decibels into multiply-by values. Let alone how to stack THREE levels of audio volume controls &gt;_&gt;<br /><br />Next, it looks like the output is always 5-bit unsigned per-channel, but there's also all the volume adjustments. So I don't know the final bit-depth of the final output to normalize the value into a signed floating point value between -1.0 and +1.0. So for now, half the potential speaker range (anything below zero) isn't used in the generated output.

I'm not sure, but I believe you reload the WF period only when bit 6 of $0804 is set to 1.<br /><br />The waveform data is 5-bit linear PCM, but all the volume &amp; panning controls are logarithmic, so they all add together (in binary) rather than being multiplied, and actually saturate at some bit depth -- I don't remember the fine details, sorry.<br /><br />As for the LFO, IIRC, looking at channel 1 waveform, a waveform value of $10 means no change, and $11 means increase channel 0's frequency &quot;register&quot; by 1 / 16 / 256 depending on the multiplier setting.  A waveform value of $0f decreases by 1 / 16, etc.<br /><br />For noise, apparently $00-$1E are valid values, but $1F is &quot;undefined&quot;.  In practice $1F is a higher frequency than $1E of course, but a tad quieter.  Who knows how that translates to code.<br /><br />I would normally recommend real hardware for testing, but Mednafen is quite accurate for most sound emulation -- the LFO seems a bit off, perhaps due to sampling/emulation rate limits.

I figured it just meant the volume scale wasn't linear, not that we moved to addition.

I was able to glean a couple new pieces of information though, that I'll try to apply to my codebase.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />... oh wow.<br /><br />The sound emulation popping was because my FreeBSD audio latency settings were too aggressive.<br /><br />I'm not sure why it became a problem only for the PC Engine core. Even though the PCE has the highest sampling rate of any system I emulate, the resampler reduces it to the standard sound card rate internally.<br /><br />In that case, I have three issues left to solve:<br /><br />1. how do I perform volume adjustments? I know it's logarithmic, but the formulas I've seen in other emulators are just nuts.<br /><br />2. how do I perform frequency modulation? I'm not 100% sure how this is supposed to work, nor am I even aware of any good test games to compare my implementation against.<br /><br />3. how do I properly emulate noise? I see a LFSR design in Mednafen, so I can probably implement that. Not sure if it's hardware accurate or not, or if there's even a way to tell.
