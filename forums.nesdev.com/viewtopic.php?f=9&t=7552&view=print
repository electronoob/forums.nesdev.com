From a developer's standpoint, what management functions would you expect from such a device?  At bare minimum the ROM would be able to tell the peripheral which hosts/ports to connect to and monitor the status of connections.  What else?

For comparison, some people use their PS3s to do things like help do Folding, things like that, but the NES CPU isn't fast enough to really make that worthwhile.
<br />
<br />Actually, three ideas hit me:
<br />
<br />1) Have the IP capability added to PowerPak, so that someone could upload a ROM image via TCP (or even HTTP) to the cart itself, and then play it.  Very similar to the USB-to-serial stuff that thefox did, just a lot easier/no custom cables needed.
<br />
<br />2) Somehow make the USB keyboard work like the Famicom keyboard, so people could play with Family Basic on the Famicom using a USB keyboard.
<br />
<br />3) Some general jerk-off device.  That is to say, some sort of "Bragging rights" thing; LOOK MAN MY NES IS ON THE INTERNET!!!!!  Five minutes later someone fires off a DoS attack on it.  I imagine this will be a big focus too, sadly.

Either that or bitbang it in software like I did with the NES232 last year.  This might allow for the addition of a device to emulate the tape drive down the road.  Biggest obstacle to all this?  I don't have an original Famicom keyboard and tape drive to examine and test with.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Some general jerk-off device.

<br />Bragging rights would be nice and all, but I had something a little more useful in mind.  The guys that built the Ethernet cart for the Atari had a wicked idea.  Problem is that I don't know of any games or dev tools that take advantage of it.  Writing a web browser or telnet client for the NES would be a neat proof of concept, but that's about it.  A device which simply replies to pings and provides no useful functions would indeed be a "jerk-off device".  Look at Rob the Robot.  Poor little bastard only had two games and didn't really do much.  How sad.
<br />
<br />I don't really care about appeasing any architecture fanatics.  I just want to make sure I include the functions necessary for a ROM to tell the device to initiate an IPv4 session and watch for failures.  The device itself is loosely similar to an HP JetDirect.  It runs the actual IPv4 stack and passes data to the NES.  The NES tells it where to connect, sets dictates data channels, gets session stats, etc.
<br />
<br />So let's say you're rewriting the firmware for the PowerPak to download a file from a web server.  From a developer's standpoint, how would you like to accomplish this?
<br />
<br />For example...
<br />
<br />Write channel setup command to $4800 
<br />
<br />0x08 - Command length
<br />0x01 - Virtual Channel ID (1 = command channel)
<br />0x01 - Command (1 = new session)
<br />0x0A - New Virtual Channel ID
<br />0xC0 - IP Byte 1
<br />0xA8 - IP Byte 2
<br />0x01 - IP Byte 3
<br />0x0A - IP Byte 4
<br />0x00 - TCP Port High
<br />0x50 - TCP Port Low
<br />
<br />Read response from device
<br />
<br />0x03 - Command length
<br />0x01 - Virtual Channel ID
<br />0x02 - Command (2 = session status)
<br />0x01 - Status (1 = Successful channel setup)
<br />
<br />Send data over channel
<br />
<br />0x10 - Command length
<br />0x0A - Virtual Channel ID
<br />(followed by "GET / HTTP/1.1\n")
<br />
<br />Then read the response from the device.

<br />I'd like to be able to do is pass UDP packets back and forth between two Internet-connected consoles so that each console can tell the other console the position and velocity of critters in the game at a given time.

<br />And it'd be convenient to have support in at least one emulator so that I can test NES vs. emulator, where the NES netboots off the same PC that the emulator runs on.

<br />
<br />Port forwarding.  If the router doesn't let you differentiate between TCP and UDP traffic, then more often than not it does both, though most these days let you pick.
<br />
<br />Be aware you won't gain anything using UDP, and as a matter of fact -- assuming someone is going to implement this -- I would strongly advocate using TCP.  Not only would it make debugging problems with the built-in NES web server easier, nobody likes having to bust out netcat/nc or tcpdump to have to analyse what's going on (well, except weirdos like me, but that's part of what I do at my job).

<br />Yes, something along those lines.  The firmware I'm running can incorporate the BSD socket API.  The ROM could instruct the device to set up a socket and associate that specific socket's I/O with a new virtual channel (VC).  The response from the socket setup command could then be returned to the ROM over the command VC.  If the setup was successful, the ROM can then send and receive data over the new VC.

<br />
<br />There are alternate solutions, such as NAT-PMP.  But, UPnP/IGD is XML-based.  Draw your own conclusions from that.  Additionally, UPnP is *extremely* vendor-specific; please go digging through the uTorrent ChangeLogs to see how many times they've had to make "custom adjustments" to their methodology for UPnP to work with "vendor X" router.  This applies to all the mainstream consumer routers (Linksys, D-Link, Netgear, TrendNet, blah blah blah).  And don't let Cisco's branding of Linksys change your opinion; the company that does their firmware (a Taiwanese company called Cybertan) is still doing the firmwares.  Cisco engineers are not working on Linksys devices.
<br />
<br />Back to UPnP and NAT-PMP:
<br />
<br />You gain nothing from using either of these in this specific case, since the idea of both is to provide dynamically allocatable port forwards.  You'd still have to configure the device (the NES) to request which statically-assigned port to forward to itself.
<br />
<br />The idea of UPnP and NAT-PMP is to permit on-the-fly port forwards to be allocated, with a *dynamic port number* assigned to it (e.g. WAN:28483 -&gt; LAN:48981).  Does it work if the client requesting the port forward always requests the same port (e.g. WAN:80 -&gt; LAN:9183)?  Yes, but:
<br />
<br />In the case of a static port forward entered into the router (not induced by UPnP or NAT-PMP), if the NES is off, someone attempting to visit that port gets absolutely no response from it (in the case of TCP, no TCP SYN+ACK response to their TCP SYN packet; in the case of UDP, no response UDP packet).  So the only thing you gain from using UPnP or NAT-PMP for this is not having to configure a port forward in your router *a single time in your entire life*.
<br />
<br />So, use a static port forward in your router, done.

<br />Please don't implement it this way.  Please do not use two separate sockets (ports), especially with one being allocated on the fly.  Please use a single port.

<br />No, it's just one TCP port.  The VC ID is what's allocated on the fly.  Because the NES can only communicate with the device via $4800, the NES and the device have to be able to differentiate between device management traffic and traffic destined to a target that the device communicates with.  Think of it as an 802.1q trunk with no native VLAN (like ISL).  Traffic between the NES and the device must be tagged with a VC ID.  If you wanted to communicate with an IPv4 host, the VC ID list would look something like this after a TCP session is established...
<br />
<br />VCID 1 -&gt; Management Traffic (static)
<br />VCID 2 -&gt; USB KB Input (static)
<br />VCID 3 -&gt; UART 2 (static)
<br />VCID 10 -&gt; IPv4 host 192.168.5.10 TCP port 80 (dynamic)
