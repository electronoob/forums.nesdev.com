I grabbed this screenshot myself, I happen to have my Player customized that way. But I just checked and Player's default hair would have also been a palette that's not anywhere else on that screen. Black, dark blue, light blue.<br /><br />I mean, I guess you have no real reason to trust that I double checked the image. But... I really did. (And I even kinda missed one, but it'd be easy enough to do with sprite overlays with the other stuff that's there. Heh.) Admittedly, I could have made the image larger to make things easier to see. The reason I scaled it is so it wouldn't be huge on the forum.<br /><br />You're right it could be tweaked. Just so you know, my argument isn't &quot;The palettes couldn't work even with some tweaking.&quot; My argument is, &quot;That palettes couldn't work as they are.&quot; My argument is, &quot;Shovel Knight could be captured with tweaking too. People would rush to find ways to make RCR work, and it doesn't cross anyone's mind to just make enemies in Shovel Knight smaller. Less parallax.&quot; I find that interesting. I guess there's like a scale and Shovel Knight is too heavy. But what makes it so heavy people are turned off? Because it's not solely breaking restrictions. I'm not even sure it's that it's farther from the console than RCR. It might be that it's farther from the console as people think they know it. But I guess I'll never quite get that, if it's that.

The C64's pixel clock (CB*16/7 = 8.18 MHz) is faster than that of the S-PPU that the Super Game Boy feeds (CB*3/2 = 5.37 MHz). Square pixels (CB*12/7 = 6.14 MHz) are somewhere in the middle. At 160x200, the effective pixel clock is CB*8/7 = 4.09 MHz, and each C64 double-pixel is as big as 12/7/(8/7) = 1.5 scanline heights or 3/2/(8/7) = 1.3125 NES pixels. A C64 24x21 sprite is as big as 18x21 NES pixels.<br /><br />(All assuming NTSC; I don't know exact PAL timing.)

In the spirit of excessive detail, Kirby's Dreamland 3 uses foregrounds with every other row empty to create psuedo transparency using 512-pixel-wide mode. <br /><br />The pixel aspect ratio of a 256-pixel wide image on the SNES is fairly close to 1:1, though of course it is wider than that (8:7 or so?). It is still very far from the 2:1 PAR shown in the above C64 mockup sprites, which means the resulting image doesn't have the &quot;gross&quot; appearance of the double-wide pixel sprites. I will agree with tomaitheous that the double wide pixels are unappealing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Off topic: Tepples shows that the PAR for 5.369mhz mode is ~1.14. TVs were never calibrated to spec, and that always seemed too wide to me. I set my emulators and TVs (when given the option), to 1.12 or 1.11 PAR. That looks much closer to how I remember seeing these old games systems on multiple TVs BITD. I swear that I found that PAR was changed in sometime in the mid 90's with the clarification of how digital video should be created and how PAR should be corrected or handled. 13.5mhz, IIRC, seems to be dot clock for 720x480 (with 704x480 being 'clipped' of that. Technically 484 lines, but those 4 really don't change anything). But I could have sworn that I saw older documents (pre-90's digital dilemma), stating something like ~14mhz (to what the plastic overlay would equate to when you adjust the screen underneath for the test screen - BITD).<br /><br /> But yeah, double wide pixels as in the pixels appears almost double wide compared to vertical resolution (7800, c64, CoCo 3 low res, etc). <em>Sooo gross</em> :p

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi guys! Thanks again for the feedback so far. I'm glad that this built up quite the discussion on palettes (to the point where I see the thread got split). I think for now my friend Naoshi and I are sticking to the palette table we currently have set up since it works best with the artwork we've created so far.<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4YZmAhf.png" alt="Image" /><br />I did the art for this stage earlier in the year (it's on page 1) but I felt it looked too much like the Metroid tile set so I'm redoing it. Still a WIP.<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Hz9rGFR.png" alt="Image" /><br />And with a filter.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mQCrWJu.png" alt="Image" /><br />The characters were also tested with a minor palette tweak.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BsS7QVS.png" alt="Image" /><br />This is how the main characters look when taken out of the 8-bit graphics.

You have people creating interesting characters, nice graphics, and catchy music for various Mega Man fan games made for a modern engine, but when it comes to ROM hacks... just make Bomb Man blue, make him shoot his bombs in all 8 cardinal directions, and set it to some NES-ified Kirby music.  That seems to be the trend of Japanese MM hacks, anyway.
