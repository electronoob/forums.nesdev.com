The image has multiple scaled versions of itself, and to make the transition smoother, between them the sprites within the metasprite are themselves scaled.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Have you played or watched a video of the game where this is used? These are boxes that a (disturbingly legless) person pushes around, so they have to be animated like that.</div><br />Not before, but now I just wated it and apparently the video is older than the last post as there is less angles in the video than on tepple's last post apparently.

Characters could jump to a second, farther away plane, and the transition was made smoother by &quot;compacting&quot; the individual sprites closer together. I'm not sure if there was a second set of sprites for the second plane or if it was all done with &quot;compacted&quot; sprites. I think it's the Yu Yu Hakusho game on the Mega Drive, gotta check it out.

Not really much of an issue on the fourth generation consoles, but definitely a huge issue for the NES where you can have only 8 tiles worth of sprites on the same line.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Only if you're actively looking for them, and honestly doesn't look much worse than if you did scaling the proper way. But it only shrinks the sprites down just a bit, I'd imagine it'd be much more noticeable if it shrunk down by a pretty large amount. The text in the middle at the start and end of a match actually does that, but it animates so fast it's pretty much impossible to notice how bad it looks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The difference is very subtle, but I think it does improve the overall perception of smoothness. The same could be done horizontally, when running into walls or other objects.<br /><br />I'm not aware of any NES games squashing sprites on impact, but the concept of animating things without actually changing the graphics has been used since forever to make animations look smoother. In Anime for example, where characters are animated at 12fps or less, it's common practice to alternate background and foreground animations so that you don't end up with 2 consecutive identical video frames. If a character is moving, the same animation frame might be reused in different positions a couple of times before it's replaced by the next frame, so even though the character is in the exact same pose the result will look smoother than 12fps. This happens in video games all the time, because even if a game uses a really poor 2-frame walk cycle, the character will still &quot;slide&quot; smoothly over the floor.<br /><br />I'm all for making the most out of the few tiles we have available on the NES, so if you can add extra animation frames just by displacing the tiles a bit, I say go for it.

The idea that tepples suggested is not in using the same basics, but in implementing it with relative sprite shifts rather than with extra tiles for the squashing frame, like (almost) all games are doing.
