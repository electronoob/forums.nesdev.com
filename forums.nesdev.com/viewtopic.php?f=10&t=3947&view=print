If you only want to clear a certain number of registers, you could do it that way, but just stick the lda #$00 and ldx "Desired Value" out of the loop, because they don't need to be in there. If you just stick lda #$00 out of the loop, it will save you a lot of time, because you only need to lda #$00 once.

<br />
<br />Yes, in the case you want to clear only a certain number of registers.
<br />
<br />So you would just need to put LDA #$00 outside the loop?
<br />
<br />If LDA #$00 was left inside the loop, the loop wouldn't stop if the x register decrements to 0?
<br />
<br />I think I know what you're saying about "saving time", you mean because we wouldn't have to constantly keep loading A with #$00?
<br />
<br />If so, I see your point.
<br />
<br />Does that also apply to LDX value?
<br />
<br />Thanks for your help.

<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">clearmem:<br />&nbsp;ldx #5<br />&nbsp;lda #$00<br />&nbsp;sta $200,x<br />&nbsp;dex<br />&nbsp;bne clearmem<br /></div><br /><br />What's going to happen? You're going to load 5 into X. Then you're going to store 0 into $205 ($200 + X). Then X decreases by 1 to equal 4. Then this happens: bne clearmem. If X is not equal to 0, it will jump to the beginning of the loop. Since X is 4, it will jump to the beginning of the loop. What's at the beginning of the loop? "ldx #5". You are constantly telling X to be 5 every time the code goes through the loop. Since they only way to get out of the loop is if X is 0, the code will never stop looping. It will keep storing 0 into $205 forever and ever.<br /><br />But if you did this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;ldx #5<br />clearmem:<br />&nbsp;lda #$00<br />&nbsp;sta $200,x<br />&nbsp;dex<br />&nbsp;bne clearmem<br /></div><br /><br />X would keep decreasing every time the code goes through the loop, and it would successfully clear $201-$205. There's another problem. Go through the loop in your mind with X being 1. It will clear $201, and then decrease X to equal 0. When that happens, it breaks out of the loop. It misses $200, which I'm assuming you want to have cleared. So you would have to make it this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;ldx #6<br />clearmem:<br />&nbsp;lda #$00<br />&nbsp;sta $1FF,x<br />&nbsp;dex<br />&nbsp;bne clearmem<br /></div><br /><br />Because by the time X equals zero, it won't clear $1FF. This will Clear $200-$205 successfully. Just go through the loop in your mind a couple of times.<br /><br />Also, you don't NEED to put the lda #$00 out of the loop, it's just wise because it takes the CPU less time to do the loop. So this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;ldx #6<br />&nbsp;lda #$00<br />clearmem:<br />&nbsp;sta $1FF,x<br />&nbsp;dex<br />&nbsp;bne clearmem<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Is how you'd want to do it.

<br />
<br />Keeping LDA outside the loop doesn't effect the outcome, but does effect the time? (If it was outside the loop we would save time by not having to constantly load 0 in the A?
<br />
<br />Why do some people do things like this:
<br />
<br />txa ; x=0
<br />clrmem:      
<br />    sta $000,x  ; a = o
<br />    sta $100,x
<br />    sta $200,x
<br />    sta $300,x
<br />    sta $400,x
<br />    sta $500,x
<br />    sta $600,x
<br />    sta $700,x  ; Remove this if you're storing reset-persistent data
<br />    inx
<br />    bne clrmem
<br />   
<br />
<br />(I'm just a beginner, but could this code be improved in the manner we just explored? 5 lines of code that does the same thing 11 lines previous did?) I don't know...

I don't know...</div>
<br />
<br />I don't see how this could be optimized. Since X can't go above $FF, you can only extend past a point by $FF. So you couldn't just have something like this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;ldx #0<br />&nbsp;lda #$00<br />-<br />&nbsp;sta $0,x<br />&nbsp;inx<br />&nbsp;cpx #$800<br />&nbsp;bne -<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Because the NES is an 8-bit system. #$800 is a 12-bit value. Even if you could do that, why would you want to? It'd take a lot longer to execute than the standard loop. I don't know if that is the type of thing you were asking about. But I really don't think that the clear memory loop could be improved very much.

<br />
<br />Is this true?
<br />
<br />I did wonder why you had to clear everything at startup.
<br />
<br />(My original question wasn't so much about why we clear the memory, I just saw something there in basic asm code that I didn't understand.) But now I wonder why we do it at all (clearing the memory)...
<br />

<br />
<br />After completing a game, and you know that everything has been coded just right, and it's all perfect, you can take the RAM clearing out of your code. I just think that it's also annoying to see the alternating columns of $FFs in FCEUXD. It's really not necessary in the end, but while programming, it can be useful.

<br />In fact, just to make sure I'm not relying on uninitialized RAM locations, I do the opposite of clearing all RAM: I fill it with random junk. Then, if something behaves erratically, I'll know I haven't initialized something. When the game is done, I'll remove that part of the code.
