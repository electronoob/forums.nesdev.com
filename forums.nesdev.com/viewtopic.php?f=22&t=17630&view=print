I know some basics, but I will need some help at first.<br />I'm a full-time programer, so during the week I can't spend many hours working on these projects, but on weekends and on my free hours I'm up to give some good dedication to whatever comes out.<br />I know an 8bit graphic artist and I have a few ideas.<br />I would really like to build a team to do some nice stuff together... :)<br />So if you're interested you know what to do.

He can code, he has ideas, he knows graphics artists. What is he missing again then?<br /><br />I'll tell you: He knows a bit of Assembly, but not enough for NES programming and he only has limited time. So, basically, despite being a full-time programmer, he still wants someone to do the majority of the programming for him. Which gets me back to my previous post.<br /><br />If he knows a graphics artist, that's fine. But at least for me I can say:<br />If I had the choice of<br />a) getting a graphics artist right away, but I would have to program someone else's vision or<br />b) looking for a graphics artist myself, but being able to program <em>my</em> game,<br />I know which one I would take.<br /><br />But sure, if anybody wants to work with him on his game, go ahead. Don't let yourself be discouraged by my words.
