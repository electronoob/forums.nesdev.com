Just some carefully routed wires from the solder pads to the FDSEmu's pins, and an additional button wired up. <br /><br />Only tricky thing was working with the full size FDSEmu board and positioning it correctly in there, one filter cap had to be moved to the other side of the board. I think deadbody made a handful of slimmed down pcbs for those wanting to do this, it would have been easier with one of those but this works just fine.

The only thru-hole resistors I had laying around to test this with was some 1k-ohm resistors.  I would use something higher than that, probably 10k.  You will need four of these.<br /><br />Connect one to twin famicom pin 2, one for pin 6, one for pin 7, and finally one on pin 8.  Tie the other end of the resistor to VCC (pin 10).<br /><br />To easily connect the fdsemu I used an old card-edge connector from a floppy cable.<br /><br />I have sent off some board design for some prototype adapter cables.  You will be able to connect one side to the twin, the other side to the fdsemu.<br /><br />And lastly, a customer who bought the fdsemu has provided the design files for a 3D printed case.

Since you've been interested in adding different formats to FDSemu's capabilities, I believe others may find it useful for NSF support as well; possibly a player hooked into the menu?<br /><br />Keep up the progress!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Playing NSFs on an FDS is decidedly non-trivial because of the BIOS region.<br /><br />Most homebrew NSFs for FDS audio don't bother to avoid this region at all, so it's not going to be very useful for those. (Let alone the whole banking issue, which is an even worse problem.)<br /><br />Original FDS game rips will avoid it, of course, but depends on whether the ripper decided to use the BIOS area for some stub code or not, so even for those it's a crapshoot.<br /><br />Like, basically NSF is not designed to be played on FDS, I don't think there's much point in trying.<br /><br /><br />What would be a lot more helpful is FDS image export from Famitracker, but that doesn't require any effort on the FDSemu side. That would just run properly.
