The NES is pretty slow, and any task that's performed in loops consumes clock cycles pretty fast, so you should avoid those as much as possible, specially if you can predict the end result sooner.<br /><br />The faster approach is to test the desired movement, and if that isn't allowed, instead of going back pixel by pixel and testing again you can simply compute what the last allowed position is. The collision data should allow you to do that. If the blocks that build your world are 16x16 pixels large, and you just verified that a coordinate 4 pixels within this block hit a solid pixel, its a waste to test again all the way up if you know that the whole block is solid. Just place the object immediately above the block and you're good. This also works with slopes, because using the slope's collision data you can place the object at the topmost pixel.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Oct 13, 2014 3:02 pm</p><hr />

I don't know how much help this will be, but in theory, this is the way I would program hit detection with solid objects:<br />-As an example, falling speed is 3 pixels per frame<br />-The game checks if the space 3 pixels under the player is free<br />-If yes, move there<br />-If not, check again 2 pixels away<br />-If that is free, move 2 pixels down<br />-If not check 1 pixel away<br />-If that is free, move there<br />-If not, vertical speed is 0<br />-You need to have the same hit detection with slight changes four times to cover all four directions<br /><br />I don't know how complicated this would be in 6502, but I have used this kind of hit detection in my games that use different programming language.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6724">Tsutarja</a> — Mon Oct 13, 2014 3:22 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Kasumi wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />There are better ways to do this which I hope I'll remember to list in another post, but I have something to do like right now.<br /></div><br />That errand is now complete, so back to this. An easy to wait for vblank is this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">main:;checks for collision<br />lda vblankoccurred;A new variable you must define<br />mainvblankwait:<br />cmp vblankoccurred<br />beq mainvblankwait<br /></div><br />It loads the value of vblankoccurred in A before the loop, then compares that value to vblankoccurred. It counts on the NMI to change vblankoccurred during the loop. So in your NMI, you just need this somewhere to break that loop:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">inc vblankoccurred;whatever it was, it's now different so the loop will break<br /></div><br /><a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NMI#Race_condition" class="postlink">It's also good to do this because using bit $2002, bpl can occasionally miss frames.</a><br /><br />With your main loop now running once per frame instead of constantly, you can move the code that animates your character to the main loop instead of the NMI. It doesn't matter much in this case, but it's good practice to have nothing in the NMI that doesn't absolutely need to be there. (Sprite DMA, tile updates that need to be done during gameplay need to be there. Music engine doesn't need to be but is cool to put there after the required stuff is done, just so music won't slow down if your main loop is running too many things.)<br /><br />Already covered lsr/clc, ror. One other tiny note is that you occasionally compare with 0 when it isn't required.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda yadd<br />cmp #$00<br />beq rts_le<br /></div><br />In that case you can remove the cmp and the program will work exactly the same, because lda will set the zero flag if what was loaded is equal to zero.<br /><br />The last thing to mention is (indexed),y addressing which may help you avoid large cmp, branch trees when your game gets larger. It allows you to load from an address you can change, rather than one specified at compile time the way a label's is.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda #&lt;level0;Low byte of this label's address<br />sta addr;Addr pointing to the first of two bytes of zero page RAM<br /><br />lda #&gt;level0;high byte of this label's address<br />sta addr+1;Addr+1 is the second of two bytes of zero page RAM<br /><br />;With the label's address now in contiguous zero page RAM, the following statements will get the same value in A<br />lda level0,y<br />lda (addr),y<br /></div><br /><br />This is useful. Right now, you have your one screen broken up into 4 labels to access more than 256 bytes. Instead, you could use (indexed),y and change the location of the pointer to go further than 256 bytes under the label. (But you have to use y instead of x like you're doing now since indexed,x does something different.)<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda ypos<br />lsr<br />lsr<br />lsr<br />tax<br />beq skipaddressfix<br />addressfixloop:<br />inc addr+1;(this adds 256 bytes to the pointer, so each time the ypos divided goes up one, the pointer will access the next 256 bytes of data)<br />dex<br />bne addressfixloop<br />skipaddressfix:<br /></div><br />Doing this and using (indexed),y allows you avoid all the quadrupled up code underneath le1, le2, and le3. With le0 using indexed, it's all you'd need. And again, it doesn't matter much in this case, but once your game has more data having to evenly space labels would get tedious, so that's a good thing to learn about. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">SNgamer wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />is it really necessary to enable NMI at the end of every frame? or is this in order to reset scroll position?<br /></div><br />Solely to set the scrolling nametable again, heh. It's a bit sloppy. A nicer way to do it is to keep the last value in $2000 in a mirror in RAM.

I'm curious now too. I feel like putting the writes to $2005 where I first said should have been enough. There were no writes to anything that I know about that would have changed it after that point. $2006 isn't touched, nor $2005 again, nor $2000 or $2001, unless I'm missing something. Does $2005/$2000 really have to be written every frame? I thought it could be expected to stay what it was, so long as no other writes were made to the mentioned registers.<br /><br />Regardless, I made an edit to my last post that does get the desired behavior. (Mentioning because the edit was made after another post was made.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Sat Sep 13, 2014 6:09 am</p><hr />

Basically setting the scroll position is the <em>very last thing</em> you need to do with the video hardware.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4526">Sik</a> — Sat Sep 13, 2014 5:58 am</p><hr />

Whee... being wrong is fun. But I'm still quite confused by this. Putting this at the end of your NMI does work: <br /><br />Edit: No... it doesn't? I just had a rom... that did work. But apparently the change I suggested isn't what made it work, since I did other debugging stuff... I'll find out what works and avoid making more wrong posts again, sorry.<br /><br />Edit2: Okay, figured it out. Here's a ROM (Let me know if you want it removed, it's here to prove I'm not nuts), as well as the changes. If the changes I listed don't give you this result, tell me and I will find out what I forgot.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">main:;checks for collision<br />bit $2002<br />bpl main<br />lda $0204;vert pos of metasprite<br />clc<br />adc #$09<br />lsr a<br />lsr a<br />lsr a<br />sta ypos<br />lda $0207;hor pos of metasprite<br />lsr a<br />lsr a<br />lsr a<br />sta xpos<br /></div><br />I made your main loop actually wait for the vblank to start (bit $2002, bpl). There are better ways to do this which I hope I'll remember to list in another post, but I have something to do like right now.<br /><br />I changed your CLC, RORs to LSR A. LSR ignores the carry, so no need to CLC. LSR is identical to CLC, then ROR basically. (Both of these may not have had much to do with the problem, but when I didn't list everything and tried it, it didn't work.)<br /><br />I added this to the end of your NMI:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda #$80<br />sta $2000<br /><br />lda #$00 <br />sta $2005<br />sta $2005</div><br />This sets the scroll every frame. It's good practice to do it every frame, even if it doesn't change. A bit $2002 before those $2005 writes would be the most safe, but you cannot do this because of it messes up the frame wait stuff I mentioned above. (Which is part of why there are other ways to do it that I can't cover right this minute)<br /><br />Finally, I did this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda $0204;vert pos of metasprite<br />clc<br />adc #$09<br />lsr a<br />lsr a<br />lsr a<br />sta ypos</div><br />The PPU draws sprites one pixel lower than the position you give it. (A y position of 0 will be drawn on scanline 1, etc.) So I added 1 here to compensate.<br /><br />I am sorry for the wrong post before, and I will try to give some other tips later. But I really gotta go now.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Sat Sep 13, 2014 5:34 am</p><hr />
