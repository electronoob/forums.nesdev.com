		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was under the impression that the reason some carts housed the internal Famicom -&gt; NES adaptor is because the JP versions were overproduced and it was cheaper to build adaptors than build completely new boards. And subsequently, I thought the JP and US versions had to be the exact same game.
<br />
<br />Taking a look at the NSF, however (found <a href="http://nsf.hcs64.com/g/" class="postlink">here</a> and <a href="http://akumunsf.good-evil.net/dir.php?dir=G" class="postlink">here</a>), I hear jingles I don't recognize, and I can't find the main stage theme. Is the US version unripped? Or are the games actually the same and the nsf is simply incomplete?

<br />Cool. I should have thought just searching for it on eBay, though, heh. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />  It only took me a few seconds to find an NES copy of the game.  Thanks anyway!

<br />Same here, Stack Up has to be far fewer in numbers than Gyromite.
<br />Or we both had really bad luck! I'm under the impression Stack Up isn't all that rare if you're tying to get it specifically, but when I was collecting NES games and worked up a collection of 200~ carts over a couple years, I never saw nor got my hands on Stack Up. And I saw Gyromite countless times.

<br />
<br />Not surprising it's so rare, it had to be purchased separately. My first NES came with R.O.B. and Gyromite, and if I had known Stack-Up was available I'm sure I would not have gotten it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />
<br />This might seem like  a dumb question, but  if Gyromite and Stack-Up were released during same period, do you think certain copies of Stack-Up might have a famicom adapter in it as well (not that I've ever found one in a Gyromite cart)?

<br />
<br />Yeah, I'm sure they would.  IIRC, I remember hearing someone say that Stack-Up is a sure bet to find one of those adapters (don't know if I would count on that though).  Thing is, you could probably sell it for the cost of 10 Gyromite carts and end up with maybe a couple adapters, heheh.

<br />That's what I've heard too. That might add to the difficulty in finding stack-up, people treated it as a safe bet for grabbing that adapter.
<br />
<br />Those weren't the only two games with the adapter either.

<br />
<br />There's actually a pretty set criteria for finding out if a game has the adapter before you open it-
<br />-An early release Nintendo published game, "black box" titles such as Gyromite, Duck Hunt, Pinball, etc.
<br />-A five screw shell, using standard flathead screws.
<br />-The little assembly fingers on the edges of the connectors will be over to the side, rather than in the center.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.classicplastic.net/dvgi/editorials-davidnesconvert009.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />See the little tabs or "fingers" off to the side? Supposedly if you meet all 3 criteria it is a guarantee. Don't know if it *has to* meet all of them, however.

<br />
<br />The best way to tell if it is an adapter cartridge is to pick it up. It is heavier than a standard NROM board game and you can tell the difference. I have found 3 cartridges by this method and I have never been wrong (although having an NROM game with you can help for comparison of weight.)
