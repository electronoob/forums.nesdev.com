It's just slow. The problem arises if you are using 16-bit coordinates (I mean for off-screen activity). Unless you are absolutely certain all of the sprites that make an object will fit on screen, you have to do 16-bit arithmetic with the origin point and individual sprites. So adding 8 pixels is actually adding $0008 to the origin point. With XORing for flipping, you have to add $FFF8 to the origin point. This requires you to perform XORing on two bytes, which in the end, can slow things down a lot. A lot less cycles are involved with A) hardcoding the high part of the 16-bit addition, and B) just subtracting instead of calculating an opposite to add.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Jan 22, 2012 8:24 pm</p><hr />

For my sprite drawing, I have separate routines for different types of sprites. In my current project, I have different routines for single tiled sprites, metasprites, metasprites flipped horizontally, and absolute sprite maps. Absolute sprite maps are the simplest type to draw, because they are just drawn as they are defined on the screen with 8-bit coordinates (like the word "PAUSE" when you pause the game). It also saves a ton of cycles when you know you're drawing only 1 sprite, so having a predefined routine for this is a great thing as well.<br /><br />I don't bother with flipping metasprites vertically. I don't have much purpose for it in my game, and if I do, I'll just have a predefined vertically flipped version of that particular metasprite. However, flipping horizontally is very common. For all of my metasprites, I define the relative distance of each single sprite from the upper left corner, and I just add that distance to the upper left corner's coordinates when I draw each sprite. I have a separate routine that does the same, except it subtracts the relative distance from the upper left corner, thus flipping the sprite horizontally.<br /><br />In terms of my main loop, it looks like this:<br /><br />1. Handle Character<br />2. Handle AI<br />3. Handle Scrolling<br />4. Handle Animation<br />5. Handle Spontaneous objects<br />6. Draw Sprites<br /><br />All together, my engine can handle about 5 intelligent enemies on screen with bullets flying around (the player's and enemies'), and of course the player and everything else without slowing down. My engine handles up to 8 active objects, but this slows things down.<br /><br />My NMI routine is tied up until the sprite 0 hit for my status bar, but I use this time for handling sound.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Fri Jan 20, 2012 2:22 pm</p><hr />

If you have the rom to waste, you can pre-flip your sprites. I combined this with self-modifying code (to avoid indirection with that huge table of data). The biggest drawback so far has been palette swapping. I don't have any numbers, but I remember when I made the change, the worst case was reduced by about half.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=187">never-obsolete</a> — Wed Jan 18, 2012 10:30 am</p><hr />

I'm sure not everyone here is a fan of this strategy, but it ended up working incredibly well for me and I couldn't tell a major difference in sprite movement or lag on either my CRT (running from the PowerPak/NES), my flatscreen in the living room (again, running from my PowerPak/NES) or on an emulator on my laptop.<br /><br />For instance, the "Apply objects physics", "Object-Object collision", and "Drawing objects (to shadow oam)" together would end up being too much and push things out of frame about 80-90% of the time.  So what I ended doing was running the calculations in even frames and then doing the drawing part of it on odd frames.  Of course this means you are essentially slowing your game down by half, so you need to re-tweak the speeds at which things move in order to keep the movement close to how you originally designed the game.  Another drawback is you lose versatility in object movement.  If you're using 16bit numbers for your movement calculations (I used them for parabolic type movements), your paths won't look as smooth because fewer frames will be used to display the updated positions.  But again, I really couldn't tell that much of a difference once I re-tweaked everything.  And a major advantage for me was the ability to get more stuff on the screen.  And the game crashing from out-of-frame type conflicts became nil.<br /><br />Obviously, the first solution you want to aim for is to optimize your code.  But if you get to a point where you feel you can't optimize it much more and you reeeeeeally want it done, splitting logic between frames is another possibility.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4230">bigjt_2</a> — Mon Jan 16, 2012 9:23 pm</p><hr />

I think my scrolling + NMI takes like... max 14,000 cycles? And that is SUPER uncommon.<br /><br />When my game is doing nothing it's 2,400 cycles for the NMI+other basic stuff. <br /><br /><br /><br />Scrolling left or right direction is 4,440 or 6,900 (these counts all include the NMI and basic game stuff as far as I know) cycles when a new screen isn't being decoded. This is when it's scrolling fast and passed both a tile boundary and an attribute boundary in the same frame. If it's scrolling slower than 4 pixels a frame, it's only ~5,000 cycles. ~9,000 when it scrolls passed a screen boundary+tile boundary+attribute boundary. (It can be more, depending on the screens, but it's uncommon)<br /><br />Scrolling up down is a little worse. ~9,000 for scrolling passed a screen boundary, ~6,000 for regular scrolling. <br /><br />The absolute worse is when it's scrolling in both directions at once, and passed both screen boundaries at once, and even then it ensures that the shared screen both scroll to is not loaded twice.<br /><br />My main character's routine (sonic style slope physics, + 8 direction shooting) takes a max of like 5,000 cycles. And I wanna support co-op, so I have my work cut out for me. The absolute worse case is the frame when jumping, and the frame when landing, but other than those two cases, it's 2,500 to 3,000. <br /><br />As it stands though, if both players land in the same frame, on a frame where it also passed two scroll boundaries I'm using 24,000 cycles. This is with no object-object collision detection, and no object other than the bullets.<br /><br />I hope that with simple AI, and my current plan to optimize the main character's routine I can pull this off. Otherwise, I might be stuck with an N+ style game with few objects, because I don't wanna compromise my awesome physics.<br /><br />I'll probably even support a 4 player battle mode, since with a screen that doesn't scroll that can definitely happen.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Thu Nov 24, 2011 10:42 am</p><hr />
