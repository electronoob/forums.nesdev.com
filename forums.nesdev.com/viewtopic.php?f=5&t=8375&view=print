<br />Player auto-translation. Offer a translation of all the lines in the game, grouped by area. The player scrolls through a list of untranslated lines, and upon clicking a line receives its translation.

<br />
<br />I don't see how the auto-translation would recognize the text on the screen. First the player would have to somehow figure out how the text is encoded in the ROM. If it's compressed, it won't be literal in the ROM, and if it's doing some sort of pseudo-bitmap trick (Faxanadu, Super Bat Puncher, and some things I'm working on), it won't be literal in the nametable.

<br />It might be better for English&gt;Spanish translations, or other European languages.
<br />
<br />The UI still needs a little work.

<br />Possibly because a single arcade system board has numerous games with different kinds of controllers (except Neo Geo which standardizes the button layout). The NES has the same problem. Does a particular ROM expect a Zapper, a Power Pad, a mouse, a Vaus, a Power Glove, a Four Score, or something else?
<br />
<br />I seem to remember you started <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7966" class="postlink">another topic a few months ago</a> about what features would be nice to have in an emulator.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think that the text could be decoded by firstly knowing where on the screen the text appears. You'd scan this tile again and again for signs of kanji or kana. It would be fairly CPU intensive, having to be done once a frame. When you identified a kanji or kana, then you'd be in text comparison mode. From there, the text's character data would be progressively scanned and compared, character by character, with the translated strings until a match was found. The text output would then be replaced as soon as a match was possible. In theory, there would be Japanese script output until the matcher had narrowed down the phrase, then it would be blanked and replaced with the pre-translated text. It wouldn't look nice, but it would get the job done.
<br />
<br />Is this the text hooker you were talking about, DWEdit?

<br />Put a breakpoint on that specific address and examine the stack. Or use the "step out" button in debuggers that support it.
