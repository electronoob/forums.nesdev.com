		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If I use a low voltage flash rom in standard Snes carts, is the 3.3 volts output on the data lines high enough to drive the Snes data lines?  In other words, do I need a level translator up converter or can I tie the outputs directly to the Snes data lines?<br /><br />I'm using a level translator on the address inputs.<br /><br />Thanks!!!

I'm not an expert on it but I think it would work, not shifting the output signals to 5v levels. But all the inputs to the chip certain need to be level shifted down if the chip isn't 5v tolerant. But I think you knew that. I don't think you'd be at risk hurting anything by leaving the data output pins as-is. I think the worst that could happen is it just not working by not thinking 3.3v is enough for high logic level. But I think it is. Some people I think have used 3.3v flash chips without level shifters directly in SNES carts and they work until the 5v input frys the chip. So the logic level should probably be ok. But I'd wait till someone else chimes in.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok.  VERY good points!  I hadn't considered the other devices writing to the bus.<br /><br />Let me switch gears on this....<br />Has anyone scoped the voltages on the bus?  Do they really peak at 5v or is is 4.xx?  I know the inputs on the flash rom are not 5v tolerant but they are pretty close to 4 volts .<br /><br /><br />Also, a different gear, in the post <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=4877">viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=4877</a><!-- l --> where a 42 pin EPROM (16bit) that uses either the 245 ic's or the 257 ic's, would these ic's provide isolation (or protection) of the flash roms data bus --- this supposes that instead of the big 42 pin EPROM, a LV flash rom is used instead.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What I was wanting to do was to have my cake and eat it too.<br />I was Looking at using a 42 pin EPROM 27c322 (16 bit only)  that would be socketed.  So for regular run of the mill games, I could use a 27c322 or for bigger games (or multi games on 1 rom) I would use an adapter that is <span style="text-decoration: underline">similar</span> to the tsop40 to 36dip adapter but it would be a tsop56 to dip48 &quot;adapter&quot;.  Even though some of the flash roms are capable of 8 bit mode, the dip42 EPROM (27c322) is 16bit only.  So I was going to keep everything 16 bit for uniformity.  But the flash roms are all 3.6. Volts with pin tolerances of 4.1 volts -- which is why I was wondering what the <em>actual</em> peak voltage on the data bus.  <br /><br />I think you are right, I'll just have to add another level shifter.  Chip count was getting tight in the available space which is why i was wondering if I could run the data lines without a level shifter.<br /><br />Thanks for everyone's inputs.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A lot of 5V parts can run just fine at 3.3V, and whatever voltage you give it on Vcc will determine the logic-high voltage of the I/O, so for your &quot;universal&quot; socket, just go full 3.3V with a logic level shifter between it and the cart bus.<br /><br />Edit: this may not be true for older EEPROMs, check the datasheets, but a lot of modern memory chips have a decently wide operating Vcc range.
