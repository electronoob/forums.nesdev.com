Thanks!</div><br /><br /><em>Edit: Fixed, see below.</em><br /><br />It's not playing at all in FCEUX, Nestopia, VirtuaNES, or NSFPlay.<br /><br />VirtuaNSF plays it but does not support PAL, so it plays at the NTSC clock and update rates, i.e. pitch raised, faster playback. (The NSF is flagged as PAL, is this correct?)<br /><br />foo_gep plays it but at the PAL rate, so it plays at the PAL clock and update rates, i.e. pitch lowered, slower playback.<br /><br />The reason it is not playing in other emulators I am not sure, here are two possible culprits:<br /><br /><s>1. Uses bankswitching, but specifies 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 as bank value &#40;disallowing bank switching-- replace with 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 if needed&#41;.</s><br /><br />2. Non returning INIT. I know foo_gep has a hack to interrupt a non-returning INIT (not sure about VirtuaNSF), but this is against the NSF spec.<br /><br /><em>Edit: This was indeed the problem, but it was because it was messing with the PPU. See below for a fixed NSF.</em>

It looks like the ripper left the entire game's init code intact rather than just the music setup. I put an RTS at $8172, and this seems to have fixed it. I also cleared the PAL bit, because this seems to be a Famicom exclusive?

The third song is incomplete, as there's supposed to be another part to it but it's not in the NSF. I'd really love to have the complete version of that song. As far as I know though, that's the only track. I don't want to bother you too much about NSF fixes though since you're probably very busy.

Including such things as mck 2ch songs, famicompo, other compos I may not know of, all gathered together in one place.

I'm still curious where it came from.<br /><br />The problem is that the volume registers for those channels are never set. I took a look at the nnNesterJ source to see what was different, and I think it only happens to pick up those channels because it initializes volume to 1 instead of 0. That also may explain why jrlepage was able to hear some of the extra channels on his TNS-HFC3 in one case.<br /><br />At any rate, Erika still needs a re-rip. Good to know that King of Kings is fixed.

I'd really appreciate it if someone took the time to fix that one. Its composer is Barry Leitch.<br /><br />Also, would anyone be willing to rip After Burner? The Japanese version is ripped, but the USA version has a different soundtrack. Both are from the arcade, but the USA version was done by somebody else.<br /><br />Update 6/18/13 - I found a couple other NSFs that need a fix. The fixed version of Nightshade is missing the ending theme. It's in the original unfixed NSF but it plays too fast. Also, the ending song of Exciting Billiard is missing. The composer of Nightshade is Marshall Parker and the composers of Exciting Billiard are Yoshiaki Hatano (sound) and Atsushi Fujio (music). Thanks again.
