<br />
<br />I went from Visual Studio to Qt and wouldn't go back if you paid me.  I use Visual Studio at work simply because it's available and we are all Windows.
<br />
<br />From a "deployment" perspective, I think the two are probably comparable.  Just search this forum for people with woes of .NET componentry that didn't come with some tool someone created.  Same goes for Qt, with a few necessary DLLs.  Back in the days before .NET Visual Studio was nice I could just create a binary with everything statically linked and distribute one .exe.

<br />
<br />I've never used Qt so I can't comment on that. With VisualStudio.NET you can create Windows-applications in very short amount of time. GUI is designed by drag'n'drop. .NET framework has lots and lots of functionality and will probably cover most of your needs.
<br />Visual Studio btw comes in a free "Express" edition that can be dowloaded from microsoft.com.
<br />I've written my "FDSExplorer" tool (for manipulating FDS-images) with .NET technology. You can check it out to get a feel of what you can do: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.anes.se/nestools/">http://www.anes.se/nestools/</a><!-- m -->

<br />I wish I understood what that meant.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I can only speak for .NET because that's where my experience is, but C# would probably be pretty easy to transition to from C++, and deployment of simple projects is easy. I target .NET 2.0 in my programs, which means at least 95% of Windows users already have the libraries they need installed. All I distribute is a binary. 
<br />
<br />If you're concerned about cross-platform compatibility you'll need to test and debug your software on multiple platforms (I think this is true of most languages and libraries). Qt might transition between OS's more smoothly (I don't know), but you do need to be careful if you want a .NET program to run in Mono.

Why? Because I used to it, know VCL well, and learing Qt or something would take extra time; and because I have a free version of it, of course. Unfortunately, they don't have a free version anymore, so it can't be recommended - commercial edition costs a lot.
