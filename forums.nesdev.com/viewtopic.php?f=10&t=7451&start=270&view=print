<br />And I added the <span style="color: yellow">inc CameraX+1</span>.  After starting our game and then waiting for a while <span style="color: cyan">CameraX+1</span> becomes very incremented.  That isn't good.  If our character waits at the beginning of "the game" the scroll variable stays at 0.  So each time it runs through this code it changes <span style="color: cyan">currNameTable</span>... that's not good either, right? I'm unsure of changing the code because there may be a reason that bunnyboy kept it like this.    <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> Do you have a helpfull idea?
<br />
<br />edit: And what if during the game one person stops traveling with scroll at exactly 0 and waits for a bit?  It would mess up the same way, I think.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That code is terrible. The camera can only move 1 pixel at a time (otherwise you might miss the 0 that triggers the nametable switch), and the person who wrote it failed to realize that you don't need any sort of special checks to switch nametables: the lowest bit of CameraX+1 (i.e. the 9th bit of the overall coordinate) tells you which name table to display.
<br />
<br />You can do something like this:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;lda currNameTable<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;and #$fe ;clear the lowest bit<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta currNameTable<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda CameraX+1 ;get the high byte of the camera<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;and #$01 ;keep only the lowest bit<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ora currNameTable ;combine with the other value<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta currNameTable ;this is what you'll write to $2000 when setting the scroll</div>
<br />
<br />And the low byte of CameraX (CameraX+0 or simply CameraX - I like the "+0" because it helps me identify multi-byte variables, even though in practice adding 0 is useless) is what you'll write to $2005 when setting the X scroll. There's no need for a "scroll" variable.
<br />
<br />That way you can modify CameraX anyway you want, no need to change it pixel by pixel, which mean your character can move faster if you want.

<br />OR can be used to set bits. First I cleared the bit (AND 0 always results in 0) and then I OR'ed it with the nametable bit. 0 OR 0 = 0, while 0 OR 1 = 1, so I essentially transferred the bit from one variable (CameraX+1) to the other (currNameTable).
<br />
<br />You can do this in many different ways, but the code I wrote is more "compatible" with the one you had before, so I thought it would be easier for you to understand. Honestly I'd rather just do this to set the scroll:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;lda CameraX+1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;and #$01 ;keep only the first bit<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ora Cur2000Settings ;combine with the other PPU settings<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda CameraX+0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2005 ;set the horizontal scroll<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2005 ;set the vertical scroll</div>
<br />This takes care of everything. You just have to put all your $2000 configuration in "Cur2000Settings" and keep the lowest bit clear.

<br />I've never planned on doing a $2000 and $2001 store except the first one, but I read bunnyboys code and it says:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; ;;This is the PPU clean up section, so rendering the next frame starts properly.<br />&nbsp; LDA #%10010000&nbsp; &nbsp;; enable NMI, sprites from Pattern Table 0, background from Pattern Table 1<br />&nbsp; ORA nametable&nbsp; &nbsp; ; select correct nametable for bit 0<br />&nbsp; STA $2000<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; LDA #%00011110&nbsp; &nbsp;; enable sprites, enable background, no clipping on left side<br />&nbsp; STA $2001<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; </div>
<br />So I added the $2000 store that tokumaru suggested.  Maybe future $2000 stores would be good to have.?  Thanks 3gengames. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />   Writes to register $2000 are ignored for the first <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_registers#Controller_.28.242000.29_.3E_write" class="postlink">30000 cycles</a>!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />  Well my first $2000 store didn't matter.....

<br />
<br />Setup stuff;
<br />BIT $2002
<br />-
<br />BIT $2002
<br />NPL -
<br />Clear RAM/Stuff;
<br />-
<br />Bit $2002
<br />BPL -
<br />MainCode after
<br />
<br />and then you need 2 variables in RAM, 1 for the $2000 write, and 1 for the $2001 write. After you wait the 2 frames with the BIT loops in the beginning, you can just write the statuses to RAM, and then turn on the NMI with a $2002 write outside of VBlank to start it, but at the end of your VBlank you can then write the writes from the 2 RAM spots to $2000 and $2001, because then other parts of your program that need to edit attributes of the screen like moving the nametable to another one or stuff, can do so without custom and bulky VBlank code to catch those and add them outside of the preprocessing. Make sense?
<br />
<br />A bad example would be using the intensity bits to show the game's paused. [Bad idea to do something like that, but makes a good example.] If you don't use the method of storing $2000/$2001 write from RAM, then your program will have to set a flag and catch inside VBlank that a certain program needs to run and eat up precious cycles. But with the other method, you can over run your main game engine by making the pause turn on the intensity bits from the piece of RAM instead of trying to catch that it needs to happen in VBlank. Although the best way for this to seperate your NMI and your game code entirely and just do a INC FRAME/RTI, although there's still benefits from writing to $2000/$2001 inside VBlank from RAM though. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />You'll have to check key points around the character and make decisions depending on the solidity of the blocks that surround her. For gravity, for example, you should always check the block right below the character's feet, and if it's not solid the character must move down (i.e. fall).
<br />
<br />Here are some posts where I talked about background collision, see if you can get something useful from them:

<br />
<br />I'm not gonna lie to you, this will be hard to get right. This is the part where your little NES program stops being a playground and starts becoming a game. At this point, everything you program needs to be more robust and integrated, everything must be a "system", rather than just random blocks of code with immediate results on the screen. This is serious business.

<br />
<br />Now, if you use only 1 bit per tile, you can only mark the tiles as either solid or empty. Forget about water, lava, blocks that hurt the player, and so on. This might be OK for some simple games, but definitely too limited for the majority of them. With 2 bits it gets a little better, but not much.
<br />
<br />The ideal way to do it, in my opinion, is to use metatiles and associate all collision information to them, rather than to individual tiles. Also, instead of buffering whole screens of collision data, just read the metatiles from the level map (which may or may not be buffered) and then look for their collision information. I don't expect newbies to do this on their first try though.
