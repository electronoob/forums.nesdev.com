		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd say I have a pretty unique problem, so I didn't hunt through too many threads researching it.  Forgive me if I missed something obvious.
<br />
<br />I decided I wanted to record all the Castlevania soundtracks, but was missing Akumajo Densetsu.  So I bought what is supposedly a Nintendo-made machine with A/V output, which looks exactly like the toploading NES's, but with a Famicom cart slot instead of an NES one, and with no RF output.  Was such a console ever officlally made? (The only name to appear on it is Nintendo's, but that doesn't mean much.)
<br />
<br />I was told that if the machine was a Famiclone, the audio would not sound correct.  So I bought an NES-to-Famicom converter and gave it The Test:  the Skate or Die 2 title screen.  It sounded perfect, as near as I can tell--I didn't actually open a wav editor to investigate specifics, but I was told that the difference would be obvious even though casual listening.
<br />
<br />I acquired Akumajo Densetsu, popped it in, and it sounded...off.  On the soundtrack (Akumajo Dracula Best), the VRC-6 channels are very full and crisp, and the DPCM (the drums) sounds about equal in volume with the rest of the music.  In the NSF (through Festalon), the VRC-6 channels don't sound nearly as full and the PCM is quieter.  On my system, the VRC-6 channels are louder than in either of the other two and the DPCM is quieter still (or maybe the VRC-6 being louder makes the drums sound quieter, I'm not sure on that one yet).  
<br />
<br />Now, the question is, why do all three sound different?  Is Festalon's VRC-6 emulation not quite correct?  Why is the DPCM so much louder in the soundtrack?  Do I not have a real Famicom?  Did the audio mixing hardware change with this version of the Famicom, thus making an accurate recording of this game impossible on this hardware?  Is there any way of qcquiring audio files (wav, mp3, ogg, whatever) recorded from a confirmed real Famicom to hear how it's "supposed" to sound?  I really want these recordings to be as accurate as possible and from real hardware.

<br />
<br />The A/V output present on this machine is the same as that on the SNES, N64, and Gamecube--so much so that I can use the same cable.
<br />
<br />Also, I mentioned that the VRC-6 sounded full and crisp on the soundtrack but not in the NSF.  The VRC-6 through my hardware sounds just like the NSF, but louder.
<br />
<br />Also:
<br />
<br />"Is there any way of qcquiring audio files (wav, mp3, ogg, whatever) recorded from a confirmed real Famicom to hear how it's "supposed" to sound? I really want these recordings to be as accurate as possible and from real hardware."
<br />
<br />That should have read, "I really want my resulting recordings to be as..." etc.
<br />
<br />Maybe next time, I'll use the Preview button.

<br />
<br />I hope you don't think I'm trying to play Akumajo Densetsu on my NES, because I'm not--I actually have a Famicom (which I -hope- is real) to play it on.  What I'm wondering is, since the volume levels don't exactly match those of the NSF in Festalon, is my Famicom fake or is Festalon inaccurate?  The mixing in Festalon seems more logical (everything is more or less the same volume except the PCM), but it -is- emulation and thus is subject to error.  But on the other hand, I can't 100% guarantee that the Famicom is real.  If I were to unscrew the Famicom and take it apart, is there anything I could look for to verify that it's real?  Maybe a number on a part somewhere?  Also, if it is real, was the sound hardware changed at all across different Famicom versions?

<br />That is the "AV Famicom". It's as official as they come, unless you have a bootleg version.
<br />
<br />The round screws in Nintendo consoles have six notches in them. Search for a 4.5mm "GameBit" for the proper way to open them, or you can cheat with any object with a sharp point. Some people even modify standard (flat head) screwdrivers by using a Dremel rotary tool to cut a notch into which the rounded part fits.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If it is an official one,
<br />maybe they changed the output level, or output impedance.
<br />
<br />That would affect the gain.
<br />
<br />In the original Famicom, they pass an analog signal through a 40H368, which is a tri-state buffer. They are using it to buffer the signal, and it should have low output impedance.
<br />
<br />According to Kevin Hortons docs, the VRC6 is a R2R ladder, and the input impedance is about 3k (or was it 6k), which is rather high, and the output impedance is about the same.
<br />
<br />So, either the newer Famicom has much higher output impedance, or they output level is just lower.

<br />
<br />Also, it has a logo in the upper right corner of the sticker on the bottom that looks similar to "VCI" or somesuch.  And in the lower right, it says:
<br />
<br />MADE IN JAPAN
<br />G743529
<br />HCV-NFF-1
<br />
<br />Then there's a seperate sticker below that one with "HN 10992415", with "ABS" in a square beside the sticker.
<br />
<br />All I have is a webcam, do you still want pictures?
<br />
<br />I'll get around to unscrewing it with a "sharp object" after all of the above is read and verified one way or the other.

Since the VRC-6 mixing is done in the cart and the problem with my output lies in the mixing, I'd be more inclined to believe that the system is real and something is messed with the cart...but I'd still like to have the above information verified and know what you guys think about the whole thing.  Would an MP3 similar to the one drk421 recorded help any?
