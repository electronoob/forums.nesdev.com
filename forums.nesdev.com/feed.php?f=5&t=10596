According the the least accurate source but quickest I could come up, it'll be priced CHF449 here - approx. USD 497<br /><br />It's surprinsing that it's a &quot;normal&quot; price for a brand new video game console. The PS3 was priced above 1000 CHF which was a huge shock back then, as all other consoles were usually in the CHF 300-500 range when they came out.<br /><br />But there is also the price of games. 10 years ago back when it happened to me to buy new PS2 games, they were CHF 99 (USD 109 at current rate, but it was more like USD 80 with the conversion rate back then) while the same brand new games were $40 in USA and even less in Japan.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Oct 18, 2013 10:01 am</p><hr />

The situation is similar in Sweden, though the mark-up is around 2-3x not 4x; I send stuff (electronics) there usually once a year, because even after the shipping costs it's still cheaper than if one were to buy within Sweden.<br /><br />I've never shipped anything to Brazil before, but if you were willing to spot me the money up front (plus shipping (I can give estimates for that once I know package size and weight)) I could get you a PS4 when they come out here + send it down there (marked as a &quot;gift&quot; so hopefully no VAT (or whatever Brazil has that's equivalent to VAT)).  Looks like <a href="http://www.kropla.com/electric2.htm" class="postlink">Brazil uses 60Hz at 110-127V with some areas using 220-240V</a>, and since you're in Rio de Janeiro you probably use 127V; not sure if you guys use step-up or step-down transformers for US electronics down there.<br /><br />Let me know privately if interested.<br /><br />P.S. -- Economy is fucked worldwide, including within the United States (for sake of example, look at average salary + cost of living where I live (Silicon Valley) and compare it to, say, Utah or Missouri or Indiana or Texas or Virginia or Oregon.  Only thing worse than here is New York City).  It really pisses me off.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Thu Oct 17, 2013 11:56 pm</p><hr />
