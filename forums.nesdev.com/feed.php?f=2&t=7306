The NES has plenty of read-only memory, of course.  Looking at those specs it sounds like only the 'dynamic memory' needs to be RAM.  The "small game" example shows over a little over 2kB in dynamic memory.  By adding a WRAM to the cart, it theoretically should fit that example.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Dec 30, 2010 10:51 pm</p><hr />

I wonder if the z-machine has the faintest possibility of working on the NES.  I don't know a lot about it - if someone is interested enough to take a look, <a href="http://www.gnelson.demon.co.uk/zspec/" class="postlink">here's the specification.</a>  I imagine space would be a big issue, due to the sheer number of strings and opcodes, running a virtual machine on top of NES assembly.<br /><br />Still, Zork 1 came out in 1980, and didn't exactly push the envelope even then.  I know I've run a z-code interpreter on my TI-89, but that's got a lot more memory than the NES too.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />To give some idea of the sizes found in typical story files, here are a few statistics, mostly gathered by Paul David Doherty, whose "Infocom fact sheet" file is the definitive reference.<br /><br /><br />(i) Length<br /><br />The shortest files are those dating from the time of the 'Zork' trilogy, at about 85K; middle-period Version 3 games are typically 105K, and only the latest use the full memory map. In Versions 4 and 5, only 'Trinity', 'A Mind Forever Voyaging' and 'Beyond Zork' use the full 256K. 'Border Zone' and 'Sherlock', for instance, are about 180K. (The author's short story 'Balances' is about 50K, an edition of 'Adventure' takes 80K, and 'Curses' takes 256K (it's padded out to the maximum size with background information; the actual game comprises only about 245K). Under Inform, the library occupies about 35K regardless of the size of game.)<br /><br /><br />(ii) Code size<br /><br />'Zork I' uses only about 5500 opcodes, but the number rises steeply with later games; 'Hollywood Hijinx' has 10355 and, e.g. 'Moonmist' has 15900 (both these being Version 3). Against this, 'A Mind Forever Voyaging' has only 18700, and only 'Trinity' and 'Beyond Zork' reach 32000 or so. (Inform games are more efficiently compiled and make better use of common code -- the library -- so perform much better here: the old Version 3, release 10 of 'Curses' (128K long, and a larger game than any Infocom Version 3 game) has only 6720 opcodes.)<br /></div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3438">UncleSporky</a> — Thu Dec 30, 2010 9:33 pm</p><hr />

OH,I was thinking about making one(text adventure) for NES.<br />Well...while DRD is waiting for grafics,at least...I started to think that I still have a lot of space in PRG,so why don't make "a_e Adventure3"?<br />Hmm..A_e adventure is alittle series of text adventures made by me.<br />First one is for C64,second one is for NDS(It's demo only for now,Maybe I'll port it to DOS,as I was asked for it)<br />Sorry,but it's pointless to post link here-game is in Polish Language only.<br />The games like ine this "Choose Your Own Adventure" thing(never even heard about it)give player a few options to choose,and dependly on answer it gives you result(like,for example,using a tank to broke wall).<br />About bunnyboy's engine-It looks a little unfriendly to play,I mean...There's a little to many text at top,but It's just me,I hope.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4239">Denine</a> — Sun Dec 26, 2010 12:40 pm</p><hr />

I think that another advantage is that it would be very easy to make a "generator" that can build the roms given an script, so almost anyone that wants to write a story can make the games.<br /><br />However, given that this same thing exists for more "adequated" devices, I think that it will only hold the "novelty" value.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4527">zlash</a> — Sat Dec 25, 2010 6:33 pm</p><hr />

I'm a big fan of the ICOM games that Kemco ported to NES (Shadowgate, Deja Vu, Uninvited).  There were plenty of graphics in those of course, but between the 'look' feature and all the text in those games, it almost could have worked as a text adventure.

Has anyone ever tried/throught to do a NES game completely based on text ?<br />OK this might not sounds too exciting at first, but there is several advantages : It might be easier to design entierely on paper, and you don't have to spend time doing graphics.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure such games were common in the early 80's, but I think none was made for the NES, because back then it would have been crazy not to use it's graphical possibilities. Today it's different since both text adventures and NES games are retro anyways.<br /><br />It could also be a way to test the CC65 compiler for the NES, as it would probably work very well written in C since this game would just perform logic and print text/menus on the screen, and possibly play music.<br /><br />I guess the closer it got was Portopia, an menu-based investigation game, that recently got an english translation. It has static graphics, and I really liked the game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Dec 23, 2010 3:02 pm</p><hr />
