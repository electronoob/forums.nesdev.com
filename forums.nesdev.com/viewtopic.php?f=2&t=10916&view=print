It would have:<br /><br />8KiB SRAM @ PPU $0000<br />32KiB SRAM @ CPU $6000<br />8KiB ROM @ CPU $E000 -- your custom boot rom<br /><br />It would need to have all of the BIOS entry points correspond to actual FDS bios entry points, and emulate all of the FDS IO regs that programs use.  It would then copy data into the VRAM or WRAM sections from an internal ROM, with data bytes appearing on $4031, just like the real system did.<br /><br />Or better yet, you could use actual FDS hardware and just make custom stuff to replace the disk drive itself, which communicates with the FDS through a very simple serial interface.<br /><br />Either way would be much more expensive to manufacture than hacking apart the ROM image and making it work with a simpler mapper.<br /><br />In some of the FDS pirate carts out there (EG iNES mappers 40, 42, 50), you do see memory arrangements that sort of mimic the real thing and code with minimal changes in it.  But they still had to do some manual patching of the program code.
