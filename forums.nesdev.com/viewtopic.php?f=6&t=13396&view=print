But this log file is really just the raw APU data.<br /><br />I want to convert the output of a famitracker sound into my own format.<br />So, I'm looking for a program that shows you, in a neat readable format, which note on which channel was played for how long. This way I could transfer each tune much easier. Otherwise, I would have to write a completely new program just to parse the Famitracker log file.

But a format that's a bit more clever than the simple Famitracker log file. The log file shows the whole APU at every frame. I would prefer a format where I see: Which note was sent on which channel for how many frames? And where does a whole section of the song repeat?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I write the songs by sitting at my piano or keyboard and playing. Sometimes I whistle and record it. Sometimes I use a DAW to create DMC samples. In the end it's just me sketching notes onto a piece of paper, and then I spend about 5 minutes writing the codes below each note and 5 minutes typing it into my laptop.<br /><br />I've tried to write songs with Famitracker, but it just comes more naturally for me to just play it on the piano.

'Vxx' sets the timbre (duty cycle for the pulse wave), '4xx' is the vibrato effect, setting to 0 disables it.  All the effects are listed in the help file, under Interface / Effects list.<br /><br />Yes, a pattern is subsection of the song.  The individual channels have their own patterns too, so you can repeat one channel while having variations in the other, etc.<br /><br />The time unit of the row depends entirely on the speed and tempo settings.  One 'measure' of sheet music could be 4 rows, 16, 32, pretty much anything depending on the speed setting.

Because I, who knows what values the APU expects, but who has no idea about how the Famitracker works, would have massive problems converting &quot;instruments&quot; and xx effects back into the corresponding 11 bit frequency value.
