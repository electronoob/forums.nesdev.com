		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A little question:<br />If we ignore region-specific NES versions and the top loader, are there different versions of the NES or are all versions the same?<br />With games, there are sometimes two revisions: PRG0 and PRG1. What about the console itself? If I bought a standard American NES console in 1985, is it identical to a standard American NES console that was sold in 1990? Is the NES from the first American release completely identical to the one from the Challenge Set (the box that contained &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;)? Or are there differences?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There are three known released versions of the CPU: 2A03 F,G ,and H. F is known to not have the &quot;tonal&quot; noise mode ($400e.7), but is believed almost entirely exclusively used in arcade machines. There almost certainly were revisions A-E, but I don't think we've seen them. I don't know how H differs from G; but it's conceivable it fixes DMA-triggered double reads.<br /><br />There are five major variants of the NES, and they're visually different: the standard Famicom, the AV Famicom, 'toaster' NES, the NES2, and the AV NES. They have minor variations (Famicom read $4016 bits 3-4 are open bus; 'toaster' NES has the lockout chip).<br /><br />Beyond that, there are multiple revisions of the mainboard for each. I don't know about anything but the 'toaster' NES, but it has 10 different PCB revisions. AFAIK, those differences are very minor, and mostly pertain to various lockout defeat mechanisms.

The only one may be the earliest no-periodic noise 2A03 (which I think never reached the NES itself) and apparently some early CPU / PPU bugs in the first run of Famicoms (the square button ones).

Some have reported though that an H-revision CPU doesn't work with a few VS games (TKO Boxing was one that comes to mind, if anyone was curious).<br /><br />I know the first post said no region differences, but one of those that's interesting is that the controllers from the NTSC NES don't work on a PAL NES.  IIRC, was something to do with a resistor change on the controller board.

Revision HVC-CPU-05 is the last of the square button versions and the only one of them that doesn't have the freezing problem I think. There are round button 05 units as well but some of them might just have had their controllers changed, because the square buttons often broke. The HVC-CPU-XX run has at least 8 revisions.<br />Then there is the later HVC-GPM-XX run with at least 2 revisons and HVC-GPM-02 being the most common one.<br /><br />GPM-02 is reported to have a fuse which earlier models don't have and the sound may be a bit different between revisions. It's hardly noticable between the red and white Famicoms though.

What could be different?</div><br /><br />I think most games that would be subject to this bug were aware of it so they required the same value for more than one read.  Because of this the end user wouldn't notice whether the bug existed or not.<br /><br />To answer your question: No.  There aren't any noticable differences in the different versions of the NES to the end user aside from the CIC circuitry.  Meaning that some early pirated games might only work in old NES's.  But if the game runs you'll never see any differences.  Sure Nintendo could have fixed/improved some minor things but you'll never notice them even if they exist unless you're a dev'r specifically looking for these extremely obscure differences to the end user...  <br /><br />There are no differences on the level of what you're asking 'scrolling is different for different graphics cards' I'd bet large sums you won't find anything like that.  If there were, we would have noticed it by now...<br /><br />As an aside why are you curious?  Is there something specific you're wondering about?
