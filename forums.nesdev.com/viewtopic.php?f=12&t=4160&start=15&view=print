<br />
<br />I doubt he wants the added expense / complexity of using an extended PCB and capturing the SNES' DRAM refresh signal, to refresh his own DRAM chips.
<br />
<br />&lt;= 4MB SRAM can't possibly be that expensive still.

<br />
<br />BTW, 4MB of true SRAM (2x TSOP) is at least $30 and very hard to source... compare that to $4-5 for 8MB of flash (1x TSOP) for the same application. If RAM is needed without worrying about refresh, you'd be better off getting PSRAM (&lt;$8) for 8MB if you can solder FBGA.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I second kyuusaku's suggestion of PSRAM (pseudo-static RAM). It's in the Nintendo DS, and it's in GBA copiers such as M3. It's a DRAM chip with a built-in controller that makes it look like SRAM to the surrounding circuit. But you might need level shifters to get any modern RAM to work with the 5.0 V bus of classic game consoles.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />8MB of PSRAM would be quite nice. Then you could support memory mappings for games using large amounts of ROM, such as for that Star Ocean hacks that is 96mbits. 
<br />
<br />I'd never really heard anything about PSRAM before, but I did know about how DRAM is cheaper than SRAM but requires refreshing so it doesn't decay. PSRAM sounds very nice. 
<br />
<br />I have one of those GBA M3 Mini SD models, and they are very cool as they are the size of a GBA cartridge and no more.

<br />
<br />I'm thinking of something like a Game Doctor SF7 with a CF slot instead of a floppy, a USB port instead of a parallel port, and a cart slot that can be used to dump ROMs, upload saves, and pass-through any SNES game or cart (e.g. Super Gameboy).

<br />I'd be happy with just a flash cart that loads off CF similar to the devices that exist for GBA. I don't really need to dump any SNES carts and if I did I already have a copier.

<br />
<br />I was kidding about the custom chips.
<br />
<br />If you can create a SNES cartridge that loads roms off CF or SD card, I wouldn't care if its SRAM or DRAM or PSRAM. So long as it's reasonably affordable and works well, I'd be quite happy. 
<br />
<br />I think real cartridges are the only source for lockout chips. It is possible to use another cartridge as a piggy back but thats rather nasty to do. It'd be better to just find some shitty sports game and sacrifice it to the gods.

<br />Sports games are great, most of them have Save RAM inside them, so they are perfect for homebrew. NFL Quarterback Club 96 is interesting, its an actual 4MB LOROM game! I didn't know that was possible.

<br />I just pop the CIC chip off with a heat gun, it melts all the solder at once.

<br />That would have to wait for 2011, when key Super NES patents (presumably owned by Nintendo, Ricoh, and Sony) expire. Famiclones just became legal[1] throughout the developed world a couple years ago, when Nintendo's patents on the NES expired.
