		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm working on something and I've ran into a bit of a problem... I need to use RAM $6000. Now, the problem is I'm getting several different results from different emulators so not sure which method I can rely on. Using mapper 0; i figure that  emulators see that SRAM isn't currently with this mapper so it denys writes? I'm using it for general timers so I don't want a .sav file produced so the bit for SRAM is disabled in the iNES header.<br /><br />Thanks.

Most games on that mapper didn't come with any extra memory, but the two that did (<em>Family BASIC</em> and <em>Family BASIC v3</em>) had only 2048 or 4096 bytes, not 8192 bytes.

So far nothing works in nestopia, which if I'm not mistaken is the most accurate of my selection? What exactly to do you recommend here? I want accuracy but at the same time I'd rather it not be purely one emulator specific.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In several cases, more than one game shares a mapper, and the games expect different behaviors. For example, the same mapper number represents <em>Uchuusen: Cosmo Carrier</em> and <em>Holy Diver</em>, but the nametable mirroring control differs between the two. So a lot of emulators use some sort of hash (CRC, MD5, SHA-1, etc.) to identify which board to emulate. The trouble with that is that anything other than the exact good dump of <em>Holy Diver</em> gets emulated with <em>Uchuusen</em> behavior, giving incorrect graphics when scrolling. If you want to make a ROM hack of <em>Holy Diver</em> or a homebrew game on the <em>Holy Diver</em> board, too bad.<br /><br />The long-term solution is the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0" class="postlink">NES 2.0 header</a>, which lets the ROM specify how much RAM is present. It also offers a <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0_submappers" class="postlink">submapper field</a>, which allows distinguishing behaviors that had been combined into one mapper number. But a lot of emulator authors don't want to catch up even to 2006, or they've moved on from NES emulation and abandoned their work. For that I can only recommend one thing: <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=123409#p123409" class="postlink">display a warning message</a>.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Likewise, many MMC3 games using WRAM work fine in Nestopia.  So back to square one, which brings me to this point:<br /><br />This thread contains virtually no details other than &quot;something doesn't work&quot;.  There's no code given, no thorough write-up of what's being done/written (coded), what bytes are being changed in the header in question, yadda yadda.  If all of that could be provided, it's very likely the extensive knowledge of everyone here could be tapped more resourcefully.  This is troubleshooting 101, honestly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />One more thing about MMC3: for WRAM to work in Nestopia, you <em>need to</em> enable WRAM by writing to $A001. Unlike many other emulators, Nestopia implements those bits (and defaults to disabled).
