Dragon Skill doesn't use mid-frame CHR switching right now, and I don't think I'll use it later, but I'm not 100% sure, though. Maybe a such thing will be needed on special boss-battles or for the ending or whathever, but chances are rather low.<br />We'll talk about that after the game will be released I think. You'll be able to have the source as long as you don't distribute it to everyone (because I don't want a thousand of variations/hacks of my game made by everyone).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Oct 13, 2006 12:41 am</p><hr />

As long as it's not doing mid-frame CHR switching.  Solar Wars is also CNROM, and it's on Garage Carts #1 and #2.  I simply hacked the CHR bank write into a JSR to a CHR unpack/load routine.  GC#1 though uses 32kB banking, and GC#2 <em>probably</em> will also (due to a couple games using DPCM, and me not having immediate access to the source code and not wanting to mess with a disassembler unless I really have to).  16kB or 32kB, not a problem (except for my unfortunate 32kB page design error, that's pretty minor though).<br /><br />But still, with the source I could probably hack Dragon Skill to run in 2 overlapped 16kB banks if I have to.  I'd be willing to do whatever it takes pretty much to get things going. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />And vertical mirroring btw is good, so far that's the setup for both carts.  There will be an H mirroring cart in the series at some point, because I know one really nice game someone made that needs it.  It'll require a special mapper anyways (yet to be designed, and no it's not Grandtheftendo).  Especially if I want to carry out my plan of doubling the ROM size for each release in the series, and including all the previous games (would that be cool or what? heheheh).<br /><br />Only bad thing with that idea is it dilutes the % of royalties for each developer, even if the price jacks up a bit (which I'd rather avoid).  Backup plan for that is to do individual game releases also, so fans of a particular game can show their support.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Oct 12, 2006 5:04 pm</p><hr />

Yes, it's viable.  And it's the direction I'm wanting to go with my Garage Cart series.  But I'll come up with some new boards to accomodate more features.  Of course we could get a pretty good run from just UNROM though.  It's also easy to build it so the $8000-$BFFF page is fixed, and $C000-$FFFF is swappable.<br /><br />The CHR can be compressed, so that gives more room for a better menu/intro or even another game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Oct 09, 2006 11:41 pm</p><hr />

I just thought of a way to raise funds for making and selling devcarts: start by selling a (fully assembled) multigame cart with five NROM-128 homebrew games on it. The games would have to be recompiled in $8000-$BFFF, meaning the NMIs and APU IRQs would have to be routed through a JMP in RAM like in <em>Kirby's Adventure</em> and DMC won't be usable, but I think it should work.<br /><ul><li>Bank 0: Game 1 PRG </li><li>Bank 1: Game 2 PRG </li><li>Bank 2: Game 3 PRG </li><li>Bank 3: Game 4 PRG </li><li>Bank 4: Game 5 PRG </li><li>Bank 5: Game 1 and 2 CHR </li><li>Bank 6: Game 3 and 4 CHR </li><li>Bank 7: Game 5 CHR and menu </li></ul> And for each cart sold, give some money to the developer.<br /><br />Would this be viable?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Oct 09, 2006 10:45 pm</p><hr />
