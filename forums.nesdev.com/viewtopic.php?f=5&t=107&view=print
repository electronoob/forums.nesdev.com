<br />The reason there are no Nintendo trademarks is that the units are not made by Nintendo - they are pirated and mass-produced (i.e. illegally).

Say there's an NES-on-a-chip joystick whose multicart contains GNOME vs. KDE, Elite (somehow hacked to run in real NTSC mode), and a few other freely redistributable games. Would that be illegal too?

<br />
<br />Would it really kill them to maybe contract someone to write some games?  At least the built-in ones..
<br />
<br />I've got a PowerJoy II (was $30 or so from QVC), has anyone seen their site?

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">ATTENTION ALL GAME WRITERS OR OWNERS!<br />Have you written or do you own games?<br />If so, we want to hear from you as we are continuously looking for new games for our Power Joy products.<br />If you think you have a fun and action packed game then email us by clicking here</div>
<br />
<br />I emailed them and got no response.  Told them I have/am working on games, and know lots of people who have/are writing games.  They expressed zero interest.
<br />
<br />Oh well, just another reason why I want to make my own cart.  When you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />It's a shame 72-to-60 pin converters would be pretty bulky to use on those systems.  But I was thinking you could code a program to use both controllers for input.  Since the second controller is detachable, it'd be like using an odd-shaped console.

<br />It most definitely is. Nintendo only ever manufactured systems containing separate RP2A03[G] and RP2C02[G] chips in them; companies in Hong Kong and Taiwan cloned both of them and eventually jammed them onto a single die, resulting in the NES-on-a-Chip that appears in many NES clones (including the Super-8).

<br />
<br />But that's sorta like saying an Athlon XP is a pirated Pentium.  The chip itself should be legit enough, assuming there weren't any ships boarded, heheh.

<br />This becomes true in 2005 once Nintendo's key Famicom patents expire. It was not true during the first generations of Famiclones.
