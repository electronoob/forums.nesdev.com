You could even use the "behind the background" bit the sprites have for a 3rd layer. But like you said, sprites are often used as background elements and vice-versa, and these situations would always interfere with the overall effect.<br /><br />This is an interesting thing to try though. I would be interested in trying this feature if any emulator had it. Maybe it could even have a slider, like the one in the 3DS, to adjust the distance between the 3 layers.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You could even get <em>controversial</em> and hijack an unused OAM bit to specify whether a sprite should be rendered in split red/blue (pushing it into the background) or not, and then people could hack a game's sprite engine to set these bits only for specific "background" sprite types.</div>
<br />This is actually an interesting idea. If we define a standard way to specify the depth of the sprites we could make new games with 3D effects that could be seen in emulators that have this feature but would be ignored by the NES.

<br />Does the string "vhpzzzcc" mean anything to any of you?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />With "zzz" we could select one of 8 planes, which should be enough for some interesting effects. There must also be a way to indicate what plane the background is on, and this setting should be modifiable during rendering, for some really cool raster effects.
<br />
<br />It would also be a good idea to be able to specify the absolute distance of each of the 8 planes, so that objects could move more smoothly in the Z axis instead of "jumping" from one plane to the next.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I know my comment will not be constructive and not really related 100% to this thread but it's more of a personal comment about the 3DS in general.
<br />
<br />I tried many samples today at a game store.  Resident Evil Mercenaries, Zelda OOT, One Piece, Fire fox. I tried all of them with either 3D or not.  Except for the weird feeling that it gives you after a while to your vision, it didn't bring much at all to the game experience. Activating the 3D or disabling it was not much different in both case.  There was no wow factor.
<br />
<br />They took a risk and it was a flop. Now they have to drop the price.  We're still too far for anything interesting with 3D yet.  I'm waiting for anything better than that.  It's just a supped up DS with a flacky 3D screen.
<br />
<br />Sorry to hi-jack the thread. Maybe we I should have started another thread instead.
