<br />
<br />i was thinking a while ago about making a zapper demo, that showed a 16pixel grid on the screen, and when you shoot, it would show where you shot at, though at the expense of lower frame rates. what i was thinking, is that when the player pressed the trigger, it would check a dark screen as usual, then make 1/2 the screen white and the other half black vertically. after checking this, you would know what half of the screen the player was pointing at.... then you make 1/2 of the screen white and black once more, though this time horizontally. you know know what quadrant of the screen the user is pointing at, you then divide this further and further until you know the grid location. this would make for a crappy frame rate though.....

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the problem is with the way you handle $2003 and $2004. First, you shouldn't use them. I don't know the details, but they have been proven unreliable before. Just use a page of RAM as a mirror of the OAM memory, and update OAM with sprite DMA's (read about $4014).
<br />
<br />Anyway, I haven't used $2003/$2004 in ages, but if it behaves anything like $2006/$2007, after each access to $2004 the address will auto increment, meaning that you are reading from a location, modifying the value, and storing it in a different location, because the pointer has moved.
<br />
<br />Anyway, you shouldn't read-modify-write from these locations that are only accessible through registers, because some locations have a pointer that auto-increments, and some aren't readable at all ($2000 and $2001, for example). You should keep a copy of that data in regular CPU-addressable RAM, modify it there, and then upload using the registers.
<br />
<br />In the case of sprites, they even made it easy for us by providing the DMA, that copies a full 256-byte page to OAM, in just 513 CPU cycles.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I did <a href="http://nesdevwiki.org/wiki/index.php/NES_PPU#OAMDATA_.28.242004.29" class="postlink">some reading</a> and it seems that reads do not increment the address. I don't know exactly what's wrong then, since I'm too lazy to look at the whole code! I think you should still have things such as coordinates in separate variables, though. And I think you should use sprite DMA's.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I see some problems with the vectors. The IRQ vector points to RAM. You should point to a place with a RTI instruction (like "usuck"), even if you don't plan on using IRQ's, just to be safe. Also, when do you plan on executing the code before the "reset" label? Program execution will start at the location pointed by "reset", and I don't see how the code before it will ever be executed. I don't know if that could be the problem.

<br />It's simpler than using $2003/$2004 if you ask me. The only downside is that you have to waste a full page of RAM (256 bytes) even if you'll only use a few sprites. Just pretend that this page is the OAM memory and you have direct access to do whatever you want with it. Then, during VBlank, write the number of the page you used to $4014, and the whole page will be copied to OAM. Notice that you only write one byte $4014, and it works like this: if you write $02, all bytes from $0200 to $02FF will be copied.

For copying an entire page it seems like a good sacrifice...</div><br />I don't know if the DMA completes faster if you use zero page (I would guess it doesn't), but I don't think this is a good idea anyway, because since the whole page must be used as mirror of the OAM, you will not be able to have anything but sprites in zero page.<br /><br />One of the biggest uses of zero page is indirect indexed addressing (LDA (ZP), Y), where the address to access must be stored in zero page. Well, you actually can use zero page for other things (the space not used for sprites), as long as you keep the Y coordinate of every sprite below the bottom of the screen (you should do it anyway), in which case you can use the other 3 bytes of each unused sprite. The data will still be copied to OAM, but since the sprites will be off-screen there is no problem. This is a little awkward, though.<br /><br />513 cycles is not that much, and there will be enough time in Vblank to do many other things besides the DMA. There are about 2273 CPU cycles in VBlank (NTSC).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">but wouldn't the previous field still show under interlaced video?</div>
<br />I'm, no expert when it comes to TV's and such, but AFAIK the NES tricks the TV into showing progressive frames. But I think you get interlaved video if you record that with a VCR or other types of digital capture. someone who know what they are talking should say something about this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In NTSC interlaced video, there are "odd fields" and there are "even fields", depending on where the synchronization pulses fall at the start of the vertical blanking period prior to the frame. One of the field types is drawn half a scanline down, and a signal that alternates odd and even fields produces a 480i display. But if a video signal is all odd fields or all even fields, most TVs will interpret it as a 240p signal.
