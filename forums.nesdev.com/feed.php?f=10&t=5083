Yes, it is possible in most cases, but it's not easy at all. Definitely harder than changing graphics (generally).<br /><br />If you have to ask that question you probably can't do it, unfortunately. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=80">thefox</a> — Thu Aug 20, 2009 2:43 pm</p><hr />

Actually one time for the hell of it I tried switching the music between a couple Megaman games (I think between 4 and 5?  I forget now, but it was ones I choose because they seemed to use the same RAM in the NSFs).  That actually worked sort-of, it would crash once you got past the intro.  Maybe some song # remapping would've fixed it, but I didn't care enough to try (and didn't expect it to work at all).<br /><br />So yeah, unless you're an extreme ROM hacker willing to disassemble and reassemble games (which can be very difficult to do even with the best disassemblers), I'd say forget about it.<br /><br />BTW I always wanted to hack NES Spy Hunter's music to sound more like the arcade version, heheh.  Maybe I'll actually do it someday with Namco106 or my Squeedo synth. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Aug 20, 2009 2:19 pm</p><hr />

The reason you can't do this is because each music engine is fully customized based on the needs of the game.<br /><br />Notice that the main Mario theme has a short intro (do do doop do do doop...doop!) and then a part that loops twice followed by another part that loops twice, etc.  Is Contra's music formatted similarly with segments the same size, at the same tempo?  It won't work otherwise.  Mario's music doesn't sound like it does volume fade outs, fade ins, duty cycle changing...with music you need the whole package, not just the song.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3438">UncleSporky</a> — Thu Aug 20, 2009 6:51 am</p><hr />

Another option is to completely replace the music engine of a game with another game's engine, as long as there's enough ROM and RAM to do it, but that won't be very easy either. But that would still limit you to a specific music format, so it wouldn't be possible to directly copy songs from various games (unless you rewrite them, like tepples said).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Apr 17, 2009 10:11 pm</p><hr />

Trying to take music out of one game and put it in another is like trying to take map data out of one game and put it in another. You could rewrite Contra's music in SMB1's music engine, but SMB1's music engine is awfully limited.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Apr 17, 2009 7:08 pm</p><hr />

This could probably go in the music section, but since I'm a newbie to nes development I figured I'd ask here.<br /><br />Is transferring NSF files from rom to rom a possibility?  For instance let's say I wanted to take the theme from the second level of Contra and put it over world 1-2 in Super Mario Brothers.  Would this be possible?<br /><br />I have another thread I started here regarding changing a title screen, would the music files be a similar method where I would have to locate where the program is locating the NSF file and then go in and try to replace it there, or is music on the NES a completely different beast than graphic editing.<br /><br />This may have been covered in older topics, so I apologize if I'm re-hashing something you've already covered here.  If you want to just post a link to me or if there are any tutorials that would be glorious.<br /><br />Thanks all!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3881">Tuesday</a> — Fri Apr 17, 2009 7:07 pm</p><hr />
