One man, one keyboard and one soldering gun.  That's quite an achievement.  I could give a fig if a Shove It! cart was scrapped for it.<br /><br />No disrespect intended.  Just my opinion.  Everyone that has responded to this topic is a homebrew god in my eye.

There's absolutely nothing special about it other than a slightly charismatic stick figure. No animations, no cool interface... just a plain old beginner QBASIC looking game. I mean, if you're gonna use a beaten to death idea, at least add some twists and polishing to it in order to make it interesting.

A big publisher will have a listed phone number, and a small hierarchy of people to work through before you'd reach somebody who could make a deal. Generally starts with leaving a message briefly explaining your proposal, and getting a call back later. When you've gotten far enough that they're interested, they'll begin a &quot;due dilligence&quot; process where they will want to see some of the insides of your operation, kick the tires, make sure it'll run before they'll negotiate a contract with you.<br /><br />2. A small publisher might respond to e-mail or other contact methods. What they want to see or know will depend on who they are, but again, you should have a business plan to offer that you think would work for them.<br /><br />3. There are self-publishing facilitators that will distribute for you for a small overhead fee (e.g. CDBaby). These places generally have an automated process, since in this case your own business model is usually irrelevant to them. This works best with digital distribution, but there are some that work with physical products.<br /><br />4. Do it yourself. Make and distribute your own product, or pay someone to do part of all of it for you. This is sort of the same as 3, but it requires you to take all the risk yourself.

Maybe there are other hangman games for NES/Famicom but I make one of my own too, and is public domain so is free for help. I don't think can be submitted to Indie Publishers, but if I get a board, and Famicom keyboard and Famicom, I may be able to make the cartridge (currently I can only test on emulator).

It was just an example of the turnkey publishing business model where they make a little money even if you don't sell anything.<br /><br />Also, to clarify what I meant by a business proposition, I mean that you should answer these questions for them:<br /><br />1. What are you offering to them?<br />2. Who much will it cost you and them?<br />3. Why and how is it profitable to you and them?<br />4. Why should they trust you?<br /><br />That might be oversimplifying it, but that's more or less what I'd prepare, off the top of my head. Also don't forget that you need a reason to trust them as well.

I can understand someone getting excited about being able to program for a system, but there's no reason to make a fuss over a program that prints &quot;hello world&quot; and changes the background color when a button is pressed. Similarly, it makes little sense to make a big fuss over a game as simple as hangman, specially if that involves sacrificing other games. Even if the games being sacrificed are total crap, they could be sacrificed for better things, so I see the sacrifice as a waste either way. I have nothing against people making carts for themselves, but things aimed at the general public (which isn't even that general in our case) must comply to higher standards, IMO.

That said, somebody who can't afford to rent an office may be percieved as someone who has very little to lose, and a financial risk.<br /><br />Though, if you ever really did get rejected from Nintendo's developer program for &quot;not having an office&quot;, I'd bet money that if you actually got an office and nothing else had changed, they'd find another reason to reject you.
