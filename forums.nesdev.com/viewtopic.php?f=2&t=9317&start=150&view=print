It's followed by the FPGA configuration data. I didn't use the 6502 stub to load the menu though, I put it in the FPGA Block RAM (3KB of that on the PowerPak FPGA if my memory serves me right). I could've put it in WRAM, and in hindsight probably should have (so that the Block RAM could be used for other purposes, like 4 screen mirroring), but this was easier to do at the time.

Then again the monitor I'm using is a Sony PVM 20M4U.  Still I expected more blending just due to the NTSC encoding alone regardless of display.

I found issues in my beaver pong and in driar where you had to press reset after power to get things to be drawn correctly.  Maybe warmup takes less time from reset than power up.  So you'll catch gross violations of several frames from reset but not small one frame warmup violations.<br /><br />I'm still curious how you did this though, the only thing I can think of for the vertical boundaries is that you used sprites for boundary but background to fill.  The horizontal boundaries are less mystifying with the use of the scanline counter.

The horizontal boundaries are less mystifying with the use of the scanline counter.</div><br />He's not using sprites. If you debug the demo you'll see that it never even touches the sprite-related registers (which is actually a bad thing, he should have put the sprites off screen). The trick is much simpler than you think. The background (rocks) is a virtual layer of sorts, because the CHR-ROM contains several rotated version of it, so no matter what the real scroll is, you can load a rotated version of the background that will make it seem like the scroll is different for the background.<br /><br />Let me try to explain it another way: Think of a static scene, and then the &quot;camera&quot; moves 1 pixel to the right. Normally, this would cause everything in the screen (foreground and background) to move one pixel left, however, he bankswitches a new CHR for the background, where the rocks are shifted 1 pixel right, which visually nullifies the fact that the whole pattern table moved 1 pixel left. This will make it seem like the foreground scrolled, but the background didn't. The next time the camera moves, the backgrouns is allowed to move as well, so this causes the foreground to move every frame but the background only moves every other frame, which makes it look like it's moving slower than the foreground.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ahh you explanation wasn't what I couldn't figure out but I realized where I was thinking wrong.  In the original demos the floor was the background so I had it in my head it still was.  I understand what's going on with the bricks and CHR ROM.  I realize the simple fact the floor is the split screen with the scanline counter.  I guess I didn't think of it because the screen split is more commonly used for static SMB3 style menu bars.  <br /><br />Hills- normal PPU scrolled background<br />Rocks- CHR-ROM bankswitching of the background for slower visual effect.<br />Floor- scanline counter used for screen split and then CHR-ROM bankswitched for faster visual effect.<br />Banner- another screen split?  So this would have different mirroring to prevent it from scrolling, and the bricks around the edge are just CHR-ROM bankswitched.  But really you'd be switching them at a different speed than the scrolling background....  This one's got me stumped now.<br /><br />Must have more layers!!!  Any ideas of how you could do another?  I'm guessing you're not stopping here.<br /><br />So does the scrolling look a lot more clean/smooth on the NES with CRT?  It's pretty jumpy/skippy in my emulator.  Hopefully the next release has the PPU warmup so I can see it for myself <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

FCEUX is just really jerky for some reason. <br /><br />Here's the breakdown.<br /><br />NMI:<br /> -read input, inc/dec x_scroll<br /> -set scroll to 0,0 so the dialog box doesn't move<br /> -bank switch CHR-ROM to animate the rock layer by x_scroll, but twos compliment the index into the bank selection to reverse the animation so the relative motion matches the scrolling versions below the split to make the rocks seamless<br /> -set up MMC3 for IRQ at line 80-1<br /> -reset an irq index to 2<br /> <br /><br />IRQ:<br /> -dec irq index, if zero go to irq 2<br /><br /> - irq1: breaks at 80 for the dialog box<br /> - timed 06/05/05/06 writes set scroll to (x_scroll, 80) without artifacts <br /> - bank switch CHR-ROM this time just normal forward animation<br /> - set up next MMC3 irq counter in another 128 scanlines from now<br /> - end irq<br /><br /> - irq2: breaks at 208-1 for the floor<br /> - timed 06/05/05/06 writes to set scroll to (x_scroll&lt;&lt;1, 80) without artifacts<br /> - end irq<br /><br />I've already added the PPU warm up, it works on a PowerPak after reset.  Have you tried my last link?<br /><br />I could add another layer just by increasing the rock frames from 32 to 64, shift the rocks to moving every other frame completely rotating in 64 frames, then overlay something else like a mesh or cloud or something that rotates every frame and repeats twice from (0-31 and 32-63).  This is what I do in my crush demo, except it's only a single 8x8 tile with 8 and 16 frames instead.  I borrowed this animation within an animation technique in a single tile from Metal Storm.  It's very limiting as a) both repeating patterns are going to be duplicated every 32 x 32 pixels and b) both &quot;layers&quot; are restricted to the same attribute limiting each &quot;layer&quot; within the metatile to 1-2 colors each.<br /><br />Any other layers would have to be achieved with more scanline irqs or additional bank switched CHR-ROM animated at different speeds within the same 32-64 frames (or use another bank and switch is slower).  The more layers added the more useless it seems to be in a real game though as you quickly squish down the area available for foreground since there can be no vertical features overlapping the scanline splits.  To be useful in a game you'd need at least half the screen height scrolling together with the only &quot;overlap&quot; being the rock layer tiles set within the playable area.  eg: my &quot;hills/pillars and floor would have to scroll together and be the playable area (platforms etc) and I'd have to shift the other splits up and down to make room for scroll effects above and below the playable area.  See games like Ninja Gaiden and Sword Master where the interactive playfield is very crude and limited to simply side scrolling level ground due to the many scanline split background sections.<br /><br />What could also be done is a thin cloud/sky layer above or instead of the dialog box, and then a per scanline scrolled grass/hills/sand/water pattern in the fore-foreground below the floor, things like that.   Another option is time multiplexing in another name table every other frame scrolling at different speeds, but this would be limited to semi translucent features like clouds in the top and water in the bottom.  It would strobe a bit but this is how games like Sonic the Hedgehog do their water in Chemical Plant Zone, etc.<br /><br />Lastly, sprites can be used for things such as poles, trees, clouds, meshes/bushes in the foreground, which could scroll independently of anything else, with careful consideration of the 8 sprites per line limit.<br /><br />But at this point I think I've proven to myself that I've mastered the effect and it's time to move on <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Meanwhile, it creates ambiguity for everyone used to the normal way.
