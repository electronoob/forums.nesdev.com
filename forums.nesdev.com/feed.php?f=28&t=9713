There are a few kinds of input pins that can be either grounded or left floating without causing a problem.<br /><br />An open collector output can be either Z (high impedance) or 0 (ground), never 1 (Vcc). /IRQ pins are often like this, where the pin is pulled up to Vcc through a resistor but any one of several devices on the bus can ground it. If one version of a chip uses it as an input but another uses it as an output, the other version's output can be made open collector to keep compatibility with old boards. The opposite is an open emitter, which is either Z or 1, relying on a pull-down elsewhere.<br /><br />There are also input pins with a weak internal pull-up or pull-down. A well-known example of these in the NES is the CIC, where pin 4 (lock/key) has a pull-down that enables key behavior if pulled down. This is the origin of cutting pin 4 inside the console so that sync failure in a key-key system with no lock wouldn't cause resets.<br /><br />There were capacitance problems with open collector outputs at high speeds. This led to widespread use of the three-state output, which can force 0, force 1, or get off the bus (Z), such as in National Semiconductor's Tri-state product line. ROMs, for example, are three-state devices: they output only when enabled.<br /><br />Some pins may be bidirectional, where some data direction mechanism controls whether a particular pin is input or output. The non-RGB NES PPU has a data direction register controlling whether it reads the EXT pins for backdrop color or writes the current pixel's color index to the EXT pins. And of course, every RAM has a data direction input that controls whether D0-D7 is an input (/WE) or output (/OE). If one pin A is set to treat another pin B as always input, then B can be grounded without problem. An IC might even detect which board it's in by pulsing pull-up 0 and 1 voltages on the bidirectional pin. If it's grounded, perform one behavior; if it's tied to Vcc, perform another; otherwise, it's an output.<br /><br />If only Visual 6502 weren't so backlogged.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Jan 20, 2013 12:53 pm</p><hr />

I decided instead of lifting the pin just to desolder the entire 5b and cut the trace underneath where it sits.  My experience with lifting pins is that they tend to break when being lifted so this seemed like the better option to me.  I used a heat gun to safely desolder the 5b in record time.  Here's how the pcb looks without the 5b there:<br /><br /><img src="http://imgboot.com/images/Drakon/5bunderneath.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I disconnected pin 2 from vcc, the other pins needed for audio (3 and 27) are floating so those ones are all good.  Here's the 5b resoldered with some pins soldered onto the audio pins so I can solder wires easily when the time comes:<br /><br />I probed everything, all the connections are good and pin 2 is no longer connected to vcc.  Gremlins 2 runs fine with pin 2 disconnected from vcc....thanks a lot sunsoft for making this 100x harder by needlessly connecting pin 2 to vcc underneath the chip.<br /><br />*edit*<br /><br />I wired up a fourth pin to the prg a17 spot of the 5b since that's been left floating.  I'll probably need that pin wired up for the 256k prg eprom of gimmick!<br /><br /><img src="http://imgboot.com/images/Drakon/gimmickwired5b.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />It still runs gremlins 2 fine.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4533">Drakon</a> — Sat Jan 19, 2013 1:51 pm</p><hr />
