Okay, so you just use the buffer in order to send various raw WAV files to the output, and in theory this could allow mixing and other things, but you do not want/need to do it, right ?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Sep 04, 2006 12:55 pm</p><hr />

It sounds like you don't understand how this works - the mapper has two <strong>independent</strong> sound channels, each with a 256-byte FIFO buffer which is filled by writes from the CPU and emptied by a 12-bit 'period' timer. Each channel also has a 4-bit volume control (done using a multiplier), and their outputs are combined using a 12-bit adder. Said 13-bit signal will then get fed into a DAC which will go to the Famicom cart connector's sound pin (which will likely need to be redirected to the expansion port on an NES).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7">Quietust</a> — Sun Sep 03, 2006 10:14 am</p><hr />
