		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I looked at both SMB2 and 3, Journey to Silius and Hebereke. They seem to Hide thier music engine in RAM. What trick did they do to initialize like that,
<br />
<br />In FCEUXD (all versions) It seems to be hidden. Did they Initialize it before PRG-ROM/RAM appeared. IF so, How can I put music from Journey to Silius in Hebereke or Put SMB2 music in SMB3, ect.
<br />
<br />I know this requires pointing to a new PRG-ROM address(8000-FFFF range in RAM) in the ROM
<br />
<br />One example is how SMB1 stores it's Music, It stores in ROM format, Same in the 8000-FFFF RAM range!

<br />
<br />SMB2, SMB3, Journey to Silius, and Hebereke all have their music engine and data in ROM (everything in the game must be stored in the ROM at some point).  Music engines of course also use RAM for runtime stuff.
<br />
<br />I'm quite sure there's no special compression or tricks these paticular games do (at least not SMB3, and I doubt any of the others do anything).
<br />
<br />Taking music data from one game and dropping it into another only works if the games share the same music engine (which is the case with many later Capcom games, for example).  If the engine is the same, it's just a matter of finding the data for the songs in each ROM and copying the new song over.
<br />
<br />I don't know if any of the games you mentioned share the same music engine or not.  Silius and Hebereke sharing the same engine is a possibility, but I doubt any of the others share.  Of course it's also very possible Silius and Hebereke don't have the same engine.

<br />
<br />What I meant that those games, Unlike SMB1. Does not show it's music engine code in RAM, (Especially in the 8000-FFFF range where FCEUXD initalises ROM code.) but shows it in ROM only, It cannot be found in RAM, Only DMC data can be found in RAM
<br />
<br />As for the Sound engines, SMB2 uses similar music codes as SMB3 and 1, unlike Doki Doki Panic, which uses a diffrent music engine. 
<br />
<br />But Hebereke, Journey to silius and Fester's quest uses the ''Sunsoft music engine''
<br />
<br />I can implent just about any music engine using a Simple ASM hack!

I think what you mean to say is addressing space (which is not necessarily RAM).  Though I think FCEUXD does errorneously refer to it as RAM (I chewed out bbit about that on more than one occasion after the release, but he never updated, so it never got fixed)<br /><br />Secondly, it sounds like you are asking about PRG swapping.  <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/docs/353/" class="postlink">I wrote this little doc</a> which sort of lays out the basics.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But Hebereke, Journey to silius and Fester's quest uses the ''Sunsoft music engine''</div><br /><br />Do you know this for a fact?  Or is it an assumption?  Just because they're all sunsoft games doesn't mean they share the same engine.  It is certainly possible that they all use the same engine -- but it wouldn't be safe to assume they do unless you actually confirmed it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I can implent just about any music engine using a Simple ASM hack!</div>
<br />
<br />Uh huh....
<br />
<br />I'm skeptical to say the least.
<br />
<br />But whatever.
