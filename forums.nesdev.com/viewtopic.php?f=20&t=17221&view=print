		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This ROM was produced during early development of a Game Boy port of Artemio Urbina's 240p Test Suite, which I'd <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=13394" class="postlink">previously ported to NES</a>. Techniques demonstrated:<br /><br /><ul><li>Fading out the IPL logo</li><li>Drawing text in a variable width font (VWF), also called proportional font</li><li>Copying tile data to VRAM during horizontal blanking</li><li>Bank switching background tiles at line 72 using a STAT IRQ</li><li>Drawing half of a character as background and the other as flipped sprites</li><li>Ease-in, ease-out, and overscroll bounce for window</li><li>Making an excuse to skip leg day</li><li>No exceptions in BGB</li></ul><br />The effect looks great on a Super Game Boy, Game Boy Color, or PC based emulator.  On GBC or GBA, press Left+B to hide miscoloration of flipped sprites.  But it's a smearfest on a Game Boy Pocket, with these analog artifacts:<br /><br /><ul><li>Vertical smearing proportional to each pixel column's average gray level.  This appears to be inherent in passive matrix super-twisted nematic (STN) displays.</li><li>Darkening of gray areas when large white area present.  I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the Game Boy Pocket, which supplies less power than other models, or of the EverDrive GB X5, which draws more power than a single-game cart. </li></ul>

Apple WebKit gained specific support for overshooting transitions when the <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45761" class="postlink">bug 45761 fix landed in September 2011</a>, and <a href="https://webkit.org/licensing-webkit/" class="postlink">WebKit is free software (LGPLv2) as well</a>. If Apple were interested in asserting this patent for overshoot in ease-out for discrete show/hide transitions, as opposed to reaching the end of a continuous scroll range, we probably would have heard about it sometime in the past six years. More generally, it follows from two of Disney's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation" class="postlink">basic principles of animation</a>: squash and stretch and ease-in and ease-out. These have been around since the 1940s, as described in <em>The Illusion of Life</em> (F. Thomas and O. Johnston, 1981).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The &quot;Solid screen&quot; pattern can toggle across all four gray levels. Thank you for the suggestion to add dead pixels to its description.<br /><br />I'll do my best, but I'm not certain I'll be able to fit a full Game Boy Color suite in 32K. I've used 23.5K of 32K already, and for a benchmark, the NES port uses 52K out of 64K. Mitigating that are a few factors:<br /><br /><ul><li>A lot of tests don't apply to monochrome Game Boy systems, allowing me to leave out their CHR data. The planned GB-exclusive tests (Motion blur and STN smearing) aren't expected to use much CHR data. </li><li>Tile data for Linearity, Shadow sprite, and the Sonic/Kiki Kaikai wannabe scroll tests will be smaller on Game Boy due to the smaller screen with square pixels. This means that for (say) Linearity, I store one variant and calculate its grid at runtime, not four like I have to on NES (NTSC grid, PAL grid, NTSC no grid, PAL no grid). </li><li>I've already included CHR data for some unfinished tests (Vertical scroll test, Manual lag test, and part of Shadow sprite) but not others (Stopwatch, Hill zone scroll test). </li><li>I left my hello world demo accessible by choosing any test that I haven't started on. Once no tests are marked &quot;NYA&quot;, its 2K of code and CHR data can be cut out. </li><li>Unlike the NES port, where I reused the PB53 tech I had built for Action 53 and RHDE, I haven't done anything with compression yet. Game Boy has more RAM for more compression, and I'll have fun figuring out how to make better use of it. </li></ul>

The SGB contains facilities for downloading code into SNES RAM and running it. This should be enough to run a special version of the suite using only the hardware listed in A. This would also be a good idea if you want to display effects at the framerate of the SNES rather than the output rate of the onboard GB CPU. Even if you don't go full SNES on it, you could use SGB functionality to provide color to tests where this is relevant and fill the whole screen using the border.<br /><br />One minor nitpick about the interface would be that I'd like to be able to read the about text for an individual test without first entering that test. As it is now, pressing start at the menu always shows the about screen for the whole ROM.

With that info, I think the limiting factors (other than time of course) is one's knowledge of the SNES architecture, as well as access to debug tools. At least Higan emulates SGB.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">As calima suggested above, one goal of this project is to fit it in 32768 bytes, the size of <a href="https://catskullelectronics.com/32kcart" class="postlink">Catskull's $10 MBC-less flash cart</a>.

But I can mention my own port of Flappy Bird. Even though it's a simple game, there's quite a lot of graphics in it. Including an as mentioned, SGB border graphics, intro screen, multiple animation frames for the bird, certain graphics that are different in GB and GBC mode as well as multiple easter eggs. But there you have an example a 32k game that is both SGB and GBC enhanced, and it was sold on cartridge. Attached is the ROM and a screenshot of it SGB border.<br /><br />Some size stats about the game:<br />(Almost) all graphical assets are compressed using my shoddy homebrew compression algorithm. To take the SGB border as an example:<br /><br /><strong>Uncompressed size</strong><br />Tile data: 8192 bytes<br />Attribute map: 2048 bytes<br />GB map data used for the data transfer: 448 bytes<br />Total: 10688<br /><br /><strong>Compressed size</strong><br />Tile data: 5185 bytes<br />Attribute map: 742 bytes<br />GB map data used for the data transfer: 21 bytes (That data is mostly sequentially incrementing tile numbers so it compresses extremely well in my compression encoding. But that's one of the things it was optimized for.)<br />Total: 5948 bytes<br /><br />A tally of all graphical assets (uncompressed) comes out to 28200 bytes, whereas the complete ROM (code+compressed graphics) is 27785 without slack. <br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<br />
	</div><br /><br />With that said, what takes up the most space in any game is likely graphics as well as level data. The test suite will have no level data and could cut down the data considerably by restricting itself to the more utilitarian tests and skip for example the Sonic screen. The graphics used in the more utilitarian tests would compress well, owing to their mostly repetitive nature. There's nothing intrinsic about SGB that would make the ROM big, other than actual size of the graphics. I realize, though, that at that point we're discussing a whole new product. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If no such games exist, then who manufactures production cartridges larger than that?</div>There's nothing special about a SGB cart, so if all you want is a physical cartridge for a release, there are various ways. Just let people run it on their own flashcarts. You could buy the cheap knock-off games from eBay or Aliexpress, which are often reflashable. That could be a cheap way of getting something out, although those carts often a bit flaky.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">In addition, with my obligations to my employers (plural), I may not be able to produce a Super Game Boy enhancement patch, a Game Boy Color enhancement patch, and a Game Boy Advance port (which someone on Shmups Forum requested after <a href="https://shmups.system11.org/viewtopic.php?p=1311185#p1311185" class="postlink">I announced this there</a>) on my own any time soon.

Why have a dedicated button for showing the about screen, when there's a menu item for it. Remove that keybinding and reuse it and there should be no problem with any lack of buttons.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I came up with a GB/SNES counterpart to PB8, a CHR data codec used in the new version of the Who's Cuter demo and the <em>Haunted</em> games. (PB8 is LZSS with a fixed distance and length of 1, or equivalently RLE with unary-coded run lengths. PB53, used in Action 53, is PB8 with a couple ad hoc optimizations for NES tiles.) To make RLE effective on GB, you need to change the fixed distance to 2. I was inspired by the <a href="http://www.smspower.org/Development/Compression" class="postlink">RLE tile codecs used in Master System games</a>, which store the data bitplane-major before compression (like NES tiles) rather than row-major (like Master System and Game Boy tiles) and then reinterleave the data when copying it to VRAM.<br /><br />I also dug up the text coder that I had for made for <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=11943" class="postlink">my NES port of robotfindskitten</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding" class="postlink">Byte pair encoding</a> (BPE), also called digram coding or (in the ROM hacking community) dual tile encoding (DTE), is a way of compressing text by mapping otherwise unused high-numbered code units to pairs of characters. For example, code units $20-$87 might be your ASCII code plus a few accented glyphs, and $88-$FF would represent pairs of characters. Recursive BPE, or digram <em>tree</em> encoding (DTE), also allows one or both of the pairs to refer to another (lower-numbered) pair.<br /><br />0.02 (2018-04-14)<br /><ul><li>Solid screen: Mention dead pixel test (requested by calima)</li><li>Compress most tile graphics with PB16, saving about 1.25K</li><li>Compress help text with DTE, saving about 3.5K</li><li>Add tests: Shadow sprite, Hill zone scroll, Vertical scroll, and Stopwatch</li></ul><br />These tests remain: Overscan, Manual lag test, Motion blur, STN smearing, Sound test, Audio sync
