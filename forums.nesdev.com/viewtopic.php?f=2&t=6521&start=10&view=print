<br />
<br />Is it precise enough to allow you to change the scroll mid-frame without artifacts? If yes, I'd say you just did a great thing for the NESDEV community. I always wanted a method to do raster effects without having to use mappers or 100% of the CPU time.
<br />
<br />And if you keep sample playback disabled during VBlank and a while after that I guess you can read the controller then, without having to worry about corruption, right?
<br />
<br />EDIT: I imagine it would be hard to make this effect dynamic, right? I mean, if you need the split to move up and down as opposed to keeping it steady.

Also I'm not sure if it's possible to get 3 or more splitpoints that way, but anyways 2 is still much better than just 1 without any mapper.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And if you keep sample playback disabled during VBlank and a while after that I guess you can read the controller then, without having to worry about corruption, right?</div>
<br />You can read the controller multiple times anyway so I don't think this is a problem unless you're like REALLY tight on timing.

<br />I don't like the idea of indefinitely reading the controllers until 2 consecutive read match, so I'd rather just read it when it's safe to do so.

I will take a better look at the code, but since the split points in your demo are fixed, are you manually adjusting them or can the code dynamically move the split point?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You can get as many split points as you need, provided they're spaced at least 9 or so lines apart.</div>
<br />Another thing to consider is that it's not possible to have an IRQ fire at the very top of the screen... but I guess that in you could just check for those cases and use timed code instead.
<br />
<br />I don't know if it's clear, but I just want to make sure that this technique can completely replace a standard scanline counter. Even if a bit of timed code is necessary to fine tune the splits, all types of effects should be possible, right?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Each IRQ is worth 54*8*3/341 = 3.8 NTSC lines or 50*8*3.2/341 = 3.754 PAL lines. So you could have the NMI compute two additional values: on which IRQ to activate a split point, and how much extra time after that IRQ to wait before triggering the split. Then instead of switching to slow mode on the second action, the second IRQ would check for the calculated split IRQ count and then wait for the calculated time.
<br />
<br />Multiple splits would have to be spaced at least 9 or 10 lines apart, unlike MMC3 which can go as low as 2.
<br />
<br />When I first thought up this technique, I was just hoping to get <em>one</em> split in so that I could display tiles from the first pattern table in the top half of the screen and tiles from the second in the bottom half, so that I could <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=62669#62669" class="postlink">fill the screen with text</a>. I exceeded my own expectations.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think that making an interface that takes scanline numbers and handles the complicated details (possibly using look-up tables) to make sure a certain piece of code runs when that scanline is reached is definitely something worth pursuing.
<br />
<br />I'd like to make some experiments using your idea if you don't mind, is that OK, tepples?
<br />
<br />I just thought that since we know how many cycles are there between IRQs we could maybe request IRQs using cycles, not scanlines (like some mappers do), and every IRQ we subtract the known number of cycles from the total, and when the remainder is less than the time between two IRQs the rest of the time is spent with timed code. Does anyone have a better idea?
