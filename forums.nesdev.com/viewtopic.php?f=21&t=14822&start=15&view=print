Every scanline, the PPU searches through a list of 64 sprites (OAM) looking for the ones it must display, from slot 0 to slot 63. When it finds 8 sprites, it simply stops looking, so any sprites after that are not visible all.<br /><br />This means that lower numbered sprites have higher priority, and higher numbered sprites have lower priority. Programmers explicitly cycle the priorities of the sprites every frame so that different sprites are dropped each frame, and this is what causes flicker.

OK so I hate to beat a dead horse, but I'm trying to give myself a &quot;guideline template&quot; if you will, to work within.<br />This is obviously a dumb down over look, but hopefully serve as a kind of reference guide for someone more interested in the art limitations and not deep understanding of specs. So forgive me, and all corrections of my ignorance is welcome : P<br /><br />256 tiles for movable sprites.<br />256 tiles for background.<br />Sprites can be built with 8x8 or 8x16 pixels, depending on preference.<br />128 total visible tiles on screen at a time.<br />More than 8 on the scan-line will result with flickering. decent to keep in mind when thinking about level design and how not to piss players off : )<br /><br />Depending on hardware and programmer, you can rewrite CHR RAM mid-level. Which means you can have more sprites if you need? So with rewriting in mind, would it be safe to say, an artist could draw 512 movable sprite tiles, and 512 background tiles that could be used in the game?

Alternatively, a mapper like the MMC3 can instantly switch chunks of 64 or 128 tiles at a time, and this was commonly used for animating backgrounds or a select number of objects (mainly the player).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So with rewriting in mind, would it be safe to say, an artist could draw 512 movable sprite tiles, and 512 background tiles that could be used in the game?</div><br />If you're gonna be rewriting CHR-RAM or bankswitching CHR-ROM, the total number of tiles you can have is only limited by the final ROM size. These numbers you have are actually quite small considering that many games had 128KB (8192 tiles) or 256KB (16384 tiles) of CHR.

In the question I mention ghostbusters II, that is because, the first two levels are similar to how I plan on my first two levels. One level is &quot;run and gun&quot; - go left or right, and the second level you are in a car, still the basic same type of scrolling? That's my starting point for sprites. I would like to mention, because I like seeing it, is anything complicated involved when you see inside a house like Friday the 13th? Maze-like walls. I wouldn't mind a couple parts like that, but that is just ideas floating for later.<br /><br />Edit: I did think of something to ask, how about overlapping tiles? is that common? It's something to think about while designing tiles and how they will fit together as a sprite.

(Each sprite picks one palette.) Of course, these don't have to be aligned to any grid.<br /><br />These colors are drawn from the…52? colors total that the NES PPU allows. I don't have the palette handy, as they tend to vary by TV.<br /><br />You can overlap sprites (Megaman does this to give his face extra colors, using sprites with different palettes) but it counts no less against the per-line and total spritelimits.

Astyanax for example, when player attacks with the axe, its graphics  use up to 7 sprites in some scanlines, leaving only 1 for everything else!

I usually limit my own characters to 4 tiles per scanline, but I try not to worry too much if I have to use 5 or even 6 on some occasional frames. Another game that got away with using a lot of sprites per scanline is Felix the Cat... not only Felix can use all sorts of vehicles and attacks that consume a lot of sprites, but the game can only display 7 sprites per scanline instead of 8, because it uses a tall column of solid black sprites on the far right of the screen to hide background scrolling glitches!
