First of all, the batch file seems to be wrong? It tries to execute several things from &quot;..\..\utils&quot; but the correct path from the downloaded file is &quot;..\utils&quot;.<br />I fixed this, but I can't understand what this batch line would do:<br />rem etc ...<br />How is it executing that line if rem is for comments? And what would &quot;etc&quot; do?<br />Even after fixing everything I can find and removing the rems it doesn't work. Maybe because my antivirus accused several of the executables to be infected. Yeah that could be a problem. So I guess I'd have to re-compile the BAS files myself? Does anyone have a working version of this?<br /><br />edit: I have recompiled the BAS into EXE files, but it doesn't generate the palette.h right at the beginning of the batch file. So one of these lines isn't working correctly:<br />..\utils\mkts.exe mode=pals pals=..\gfx\palts.png out=work\palbg0.h label=palts0 silent<br />copy /b work\palfg0.h + work\palbg0.h + work\palbgend.h + work\pallightning.h assets\palettes.h &gt; nul<br /><br />edit2: yeah, palts.png doesn't exist.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry for the inconvenience. MK2 is a bit of a mess. That's why it hasn't been released properly as a standalone product. In fact, the engine is customized for each new game, with tons of new stuff added in each iteration. What's in the repo is just a copy of the latest customization. That's why it doesn't compile: it's incomplete.<br /><br />MK2 is not ready yet for release, that's why there's no proper readme.md or any docs whatsoever. What's in the repo is outdated and definitely not ready to use. To get proper, working MK2 examples check <a href="https://github.com/mojontwins/Gran_Sabiduria_v2/tree/master/src" class="postlink">this</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mojontwins/Miedow_NES" class="postlink">this</a> (this year's compo entry, latest MK2 version). Our you can wait until I finish what I am preparing to have a proper working, documented, and ready to use engine - I'm almost finished, just writing some docs at the moment. Please bear with us <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

It would help though to have some disclaimer telling people that it isn't complete, because the ones likely to try it out are exactly the ones that need some working example to help them learn nes development, and it not working actually may throw them off in the complete opposite direction of figuring this thing isn't for them.<br /><br />I tried the miedow project, and it almost compiles everything, but it throws an error that I've found with most of the other projects: it doesn't find the zeropage.inc. Then a lot of errors happen after that, which may be related to this.

I've been working on an Assembly-based tutorial for the last week, at the request of a colleague.<br /><br />It goes from &quot;Hello World!&quot;, to a Space Shooter, all the way up to a tongue-in-cheek Mario clone! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />I'm currently designing the webpage for it, to make the tutorial as professional as possible.<br />It will contain Assembly in spoiler boxes, in NESASM, ASM6, and CC65 syntax. I figured, why not cover them all?

Extract cc65 wherever you like (e.g., C:\cc65), then add the binary directory (e.g., C:\cc65\bin) to the PATH environment variable. On recent versions of Windows you can press the Windows button and type in &quot;environment variable&quot;, it should suggest you &quot;Edit the system environment variables&quot; to get you the GUI for changing it. You can verify that your change took effect by executing <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">echo %PATH%</tt> in the command line. (Remember to reopen cmd.exe if you had it open before editing the variable.)<br /><br />EDIT: Forgot that the cc65 binaries are in the &quot;bin&quot; directory.

These were exactly my steps (using windows 8.1):<br />- System Properties<br />- Advanced<br />- Environment Variables...<br />- System Variables -&gt; New...<br />- Variable name: PATH<br />- Variable value: C:\cc65<br /><br />open cmd prompt, type echo %PATH%, nothing appeared.<br /><br />So I tried instead of System Variables, adding it to the User Variables, at the end of the already present variables. Now the path appears on the cmd. But the command is not recognized when compiling the project.<br />Then I added C:\cc65\bin to the path, along with C:\cc65. Alas, the game compiled (miedow). I have to say, I don't think this is an ideal scenario for cc65 usage, it's too complicated to discover without proper guidance. I consider myself to be an advanced dos and windows user, and I had never set PATH on environment variables under windows (on DOS I did). I don't know what the solution is, but this is definitely scary to new developers. Can I update the wiki with these new instructions for windows users?
