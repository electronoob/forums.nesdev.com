		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, I'm trying to run my Famicom (shipped from Japan) in good ol' Memphis, TN, and I'm having troubles.  Is like channel 2 in Japan different from channel 2 in the US?  Because I set my RF thingie to channel 2 and "GAME," connect it to a TV, change the TV to channel 2, and turn the system on.  Nothing but a slight change in the color of the static.  Got access to a VCR that lets me change to channel 1; still nothing.  The seller (who is slow to respond) suggested setting the TV to channel 36 or 39, but it still doesn't work.  I find that (while the RF thingie is set to 2), channels 6, 9, and 39 seem to have the greatest effect.  On channel 6, a completely different pattern of static forms  when I turn it on and it reverts back to the static before I turned it on when I turn it off. Sometimes, I'll see what looks like a game screen drop in temporarily and rop back out.   On channels 9 and 39, same static as when it is off, but sometimes the game screen'll drop in and out.
<br />
<br />Perhaps I should try switching the RF switch to channel 1 (the only other channel available) and try different channels to see what happens.  Oh, btw, I'm still waiting on a response from the seller about the latest update (last paragraph) that I sent her.

<br />
<br />Next question, regarding the Famicom Disk System, I got it to work earlier today, on the older of 2 systems that I got.  I got one that is brand new (or said to be in "mint" condition) and one that is older.  The one that is older worked, only after much trial and error: It loaded World 5 in SMB2 well, but after beating World 8, it could not load the princess scene, citing "Disk Trouble" errors.  I often took out and reinserted the disk in the process, sometimes it would load forever and not do anything or make any noise, and sometimes it would make some noise and then have some error: Nos. 21, 22, 23, 25, and 27.  I eventually gave up with it.  Now, I can't even get it to work again.
<br />
<br />With the new one, when I put the disk in, and have the system is on, it just sits there on the loading screen, never doing anything else, and I hear a constant chug chug noise from it (it is not erratic, and does it constantly for the duration of the loading).  This was said to be in "mint" condition.  At least this newer one is more consistent, as the older one seems to have random "Disk Trouble" errors after hearing an erratic "click click" sound.
<br />
<br />Do you know what the matter is?

<br />Ugh, OK.  The repair would be worth more than the console.  I guess I'll have to contact the seller.  These sellers are so retarded, sending me these consoles without them working or making figure out or ask them so they can finally tell me....

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />how is the condition of the diskette? sounds like the diskette could be damaged physically or even possibly have been partially erased/corrupted by a magnetic source.  I'm not super familiar with the FDS but if the diskettes are anything like the old Apple II's that sounds like a potential culprit.

<br />
<br />If the head moves (motor sound then click then motor sound), you don't need a belt replacement. I wouldn't mess with the belt unless you have to to, checking out an old belt will probably actually lead to breaking it...
<br />
<br />Assuming the disk spins, when the head is at the very top, lightly push against the head and downward at the same time. Unfortunately this is the only way you can reliably use the FDS if you have bootleg disks or a feeble old drive.
<br />
<br />If games work (they probably will), you need to tighten the head's spring/add more cotton stuff or fix the newer drive with a better head. Personally I don't bother, I just keep the top off and do the pressure thing since most of my disks won't load reliably on a minty FDS anyway.
<br />
<br />If it doesn't work, you need to adjust the head using the small screwhole on the back of the head. Sadly it's coated in red wax or something so you need to either melt it out or cut it out. From there turn the screw VERY slightly in either directions until it works. This is a pretty difficult operation, so only try in desperation. I once lost a drive trying to realign the head because of the adjustment screw getting stripped so be careful.
