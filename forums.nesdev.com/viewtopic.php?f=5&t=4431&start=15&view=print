It's entirely possible to keep Windows running indefinitely if you know what you're doing.
<br />
<br />I think the majority of people that reinstall Windows on a monthly basis (not necessarily you, tokumaru) are too lazy to bother with such maintenance, or extremely reckless in their online activities, or both. Just because their systems are bogged down with malware, leftover files, and other crap does not mean <em>everyone's</em> system will end up like that.
<br />
<br />I take pride in the fact that I've never had to deal with a malware infestation on any of my machines, and I didn't need McAfee or Ad-Aware chewing on my CPU to accomplish that.

<br />
<br />I don't reinstall often but the major cause are because of some rogue software that I tried decided to break one part of my registry and when removed didn't clean-up everything properly or some driver decided to wreak havoc on my system.  I rarely get any malware installed on my system if any. When I can, I try to fix my machine before zapping it.
<br />
<br />But in most case, when a system is crippled with malware, this is mostly because of the recklessness in a user's online habit, my father being a good example at that <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> He must be reinstalling every week these days... I'm sooo happy to be in Japan and don't have to "fix" that machine anymore.

Even though I follow the "if it's bogging down, format it!" philosophy, I manage to only do it only once a year or so.<br /><br />I'm actually a very careful guy when it comes to my PC. Like I said, everything that is potentially dangerous is done in a virtual machine first. The same goes for software I'm not sure I want to keep and for software I know I'll use only once, to keep left overs on my real system to a minimum.<br /><br />So my own PC doesn't really bog down, but I still format when I see it has too much old software, shows ANY sign of virus infections and things like that, because I want my system clean. I don't really have a customized windows installation, but I have all my drivers and such well organized, so I don't mind spending a couple of hours a year setting everything up.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Banshaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I rarely get any malware installed on my system if any.

<br />Heh, that's exactly the problem! I don't mind doing some maintenance on my own PC, but this is something I find extremely annoying. I do it for the family, but I really don't like it. I have an aunt that loves to ask me about sofware I never used... over the phone, what's worse. Don't you hate when you have to guide over the phone someone that can't tell a left click from a right one? It takes hours to accomplish the most basic tasks.

<br />
<br />Man, this is a pet peeve of mine. I finally got to the point where I just tell family members and friends that I have no clue how to fix *insert problem that isn't really a problem here*. It's so hard to try and tell someone how to do stuff over the phone, so I just end up saying I don't know what to do for them. Kind of a cop-out, but when you actually do help people, they keep calling back WAY too often for the stupidest, most simple things. It gets to be too much of a chore when it really shouldn't be.

I'd say it's my favourite OS ever, and I don't care what anyone says (95 were great back then too).<br />If it's getting really too old one day I'll switch to Ubuntu, but it is not as good when it comes to drivers and you always have to download pieces of programms I've hard.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I HATE fixing!

<br />At least I can be glad that I've decided to study electronics instead (and take computers science courses as well). But when people gives you broken devices and expect you to repair them it's not way better.

<br />You gotta be mistaking it for Windows ME. That thing crashed every 5 minutes. Win2K is actually quite stable, probably as much as XP. I prefer XP though, it fixed some annoying things 2K had.
<br />
<br />Bregalad, did you know you can disable most of XP's eyecandy (the "round" interface, the transparencies, etc) and have it look a lot like 2000 and be much lighter than usual? It is true that lots of new software require XP, so you will soon need to upgrade anyway.
<br />
<br />I'm trying to get rid of Windows, because there is no way in hell I'm switching to the monstrosity that is Vista. However, I just can't seem understand such basic things of Linux, like installing a device driver. For now I'm hoping some day I'll get it, so I'm already getting used to all sorts of open source Linux software that is also available for Windows, instead of the proprietary stuff.
<br />
<br />I ditched Photoshop for GIMP, CorelDRAW for Inkscape, M$ Office for OpenOffice... hopefully that will make my transition easier when I finally manage to make the switch.

<br />Isn't that infuriating? It's the exact same reason I upgraded to XP! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" />
<br />
<br />In my case, ATi's video driver packages suddenly stopped working in 2K right around version 7.4 (I think?)--they'd just throw up an "unsupported OS" error and quit. (A major architectural change in a minor version update? Bullsh*t!) Not surprisingly, all ATi really did was make a small change to the .INF file, and twiddling with it a bit will allow the drivers to install and work just fine in 2K. Of course, I didn't discover this until after I had upgraded... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />
<br />
<br />Now, I'm actually pretty happy with XP's features and stability, but I still don't appreciate being forced into an upgrade I didn't really want or need. Instead of outright "removing" Win2K support, why didn't ATi just add an OS check that pops up a warning dialog, stating that the drivers are untested/unsupported and any problems you encounter are entirely your fault? Do you think maybe MS "convinced" them to drop support, in their own devious little way...?
<br />
<br />As for bluescreens, the only one I've gotten in recent memory was a result of running one of Pixel's (the Cave Story guy) music editors through my Audigy 2--it crashed HARD. God bless Creative and their wonderful drivers!

<br />
<br />Same thing here. I still have that Win2K CD lying in a drawer, accumulating dust...
<br />
<br />If you look at their name, Win2K was called NT5 and XP -&gt; NT5.1... They are virtually the same, except for some change in the way driver are handled (signed thing) and some improvement in the sound handling, which I forgot what.
<br />
<br />I wanted to try it again but when I bought my new machine, it didn't recognized the hard drive, controllers, anything, even with the appropriate driver for SATA drive. Even the chipsets drivers were not supported.. Since Win2K support is already over we have to forget about it with new hardware. 
<br />
<br />And if by any chance (or mistake), you bought a recent game then you won't be able to run it too.  
<br />
<br />I think I have to get used to windows XP for now. I tried vista 64 at work and once it decided to fail, I just removed the partition and went back to XP.

<br />The big change to audio in Windows XP that I can think of relates to digital restrictions management, a scheme used by publishers of copyrighted works to deter some forms of copying. It's called Secure Audio Path, which lets a Windows Media file require that its audio be played only through drivers with a Windows logo. It also requires drivers not to play Secure Audio Path audio through cleartext digital outputs.

<br />Yes this sounds really great. This is the only thing that make we maybe want to switch to Ubuntu someday.
<br />
<br />PS : In fact what I say about Win2k isn't totally true. When I try to open a folder from a device that isn't connected (network or USB key), it really is freezing and this is really annoying. I don't know why it just don't tell "connexion unavaiable" instead of keeping trying again a million of times and freezing. However I doubt XP or Vista fixed that problem.
