<br />By the same logic, one could have claimed in 2001 that the GBA wasn't a Game Boy, because Game Boys have a smaller screen, have no 32-bit CPU or Super NES style PPU, have interesting games developped for and are 100% backward compatible. (GBA was not compatible with GBC titles that relied on the GBC's infrared link.)

<br />
<br />So true.  The newest "Game Boy" is the GBA SP2 (new backlit version) that was released last year 2005, and it still plays the very first Game Boy game ever released (from 1989).  The "Game Boy micro" isn't really a Game Boy, in my opinion.  It as much a DS as it is a Game Boy.
<br />
<br />There still has yet to be a Game Boy that is across the board better than all other Game Boys.  The SGB has its advantages, while the original GBA has the best form factor for comfort, yet a crappy D-pad and a crappy screen.  Similar things can be said about every Game Boy.  Hell, multi-tracking on the GB people claim that the original Game Boy has the best audio.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />All I've heard about trouble on backward compability is that some sound hardware timing is clocked differently on the GBC/GBA than on the original Game Boy, so it cause some minor sound glitches. The impact should a bit similar than interchangin the 5-step sequence and the 4-step sequence via $4017 on NES games, wich sometimes causes minor sound glitches.
<br />The GBA screen is a lot better than GBC one, wich definitly have too low resolution. It caused a lot of problem with menus in games, because they didn't have room to write enough text.
<br />Now for many people "Game Boy" mean "Portable gaming system", regardless of if it is manufactured by Nintendo or not (because the Game Boy  is the most popular). So most people are refering portable telephones, calculators, PSPs, Tamagoshis, etc.... as "Game Boys" just because they are small portable devices where games can be installed. In that case, yeah the DS is a Game Boy. But else, it isn't officially called "Game Boy". It is "Nintendo DS", no "Game Boy DS", as many says.
<br />Maybe it is just maketing purposes, to still have people buy GBAs, tough.

<br />
<br />One a side note, the games developped for a console sure influence more than it's name but... the name of a console influcence on people developping games for. So, unlike some people say, the name still is important.
