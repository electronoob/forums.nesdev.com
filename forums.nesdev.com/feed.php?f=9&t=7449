looks like the pins don't line up exactly, but they don't touch the pin next to them either. That's the important thing. After seeing this picture I opened up my Retro Duo to see if perhaps the clones do in fact just make do with 2.54mm slots. The pins don't line up exactly in a retro duo either. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v107/super-hampster/?action=view&amp;current=100_0430.jpg">http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v107/ ... 0_0430.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The picture is blurry but hopefully it's clear enough to see. Perhaps the clones do use a 2.54mm slot. Of course I'd want to see more evidence before I plugged up a PowerPak in a slot I knew was 2.54mm.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: Ok I couldn't resist.

Well, simple math says that the cumulative difference for 71 spaces is 2.84mm, more than the width of one pin-space to begin-with, and thus wider than one of the NES cart pins as well; I would thin it's off by around 1.2 pins of width by the end. <br /><br />You can also use something of a known pitch to measure against, like another connector, or a PCB with pre-drilled holes (they make vero in a variety of pitch scales). The problem comes in with nonstandard stuff, where you need absolute accuracy: This is one of those items, but for most stuff, you can just eye it and know what it wants... I could use an analogue micrometer if I was hard-up for a measurement, but I'm not sure I'd trust any non-industrial ruler made int he past 25 years to be anywhere near accurate. <br /><br />My old drafting tools though, are quite another matter: They may be analogue, or I may need a loupe to see the markings, but they're spot-on. I used cheap tools to measure the NESpander connectors on my first run-through of having them moulded, which is why they turned out wrong: Stupid mistake, and I should know better.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Sat Feb 05, 2011 3:02 am</p><hr />
