		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Alright folks, so I did some research on this and found a trick (if I understood it correctly), and just had a few questions.  I've been considering jumping to 8x16 tiles, which may necessitate 'foreground' background tiles.  I understand the NES does not have a way to create a foreground layer, per se, but I also found a trick on the forums that I think I understand.<br /><br />1. Draw a sprite that is the same shape as the background tile and place it in the same location.<br />2. Put it 'behind' the background, by making it a back priority sprite (it will be hidden by the background tile)<br />3. Give it a higher priority than the player sprite, for instance, therefor the player sprite will be drawn behind it. <br /><br />This would, essentially, have the effect of a background-shaped-hole in the sprite field for anything thats a lower priority.  Do I essentially have that correct?<br /><br />It seems that this would get expensive with sprites, though, if all 'foreground sprites' were drawn to the screen all the time.  Would it make sense to update their drawing using a background collision detection method?  Only draw the 'ghosting' sprite if an object is present at that position, that way it's not using up sprite resources all the time?  A screen could be full of a lot of 'foreground images', but they're only really activated with the foreground ghosting sprite when the player (or other object) is actually in a place where he needs to be affected by one?  That's sort of what I've been contemplating...just wanted some advice from folks who may have done something like this before to preempt impending headaches!<br /><br />Thanks.  You guys rock!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Solstice did it by using CHR-RAM and rendering the occlusion to the sprite. This takes up a lot of PPU write bandwidth, though, so your vblank will be pretty tight with this method (note that Solstice isn't additionally burdened by scrolling).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I saw that method too.  The former seemed the more logical choice right now if I am understanding it right.  Does that method make sense from a pragmatic standpoint? *the method I first described, I mean*.<br /><br />I'm going to try some tests this weekend, and if I am conceptually understanding, it should be easy to implement small scale, I'm just wondering about larger scale implications that I might not be thinking of when the game gets more complex.<br /><br />For instance, if I have five 2x2 sprite monsters running around the screen, plus 2 power ups on the screen, plus my 2x2 player...that's 30 sprites being drawn.  If all sprites happen to be behind 'cover sprites', that's 60 sprites on the screen at the same time...nearing that 64 sprite limit.  Throw a few weapon sprites or projectiles flying around, and it could hit that 64 sprite limit pretty quickly.  I suppose the idea would be to plan to limit that possibility and develop complex contingencies for more than 8 sprites existing on a scanline (which, using this method, would likely happen pretty often) or over the 64 limit sprite draws.<br /><br />I like the puzzle of it, just making sure I am understanding the fundamentals before diving into it.<br /><br />Thanks!

So does Super Mario Bros. 3 when you knock a mushroom out of a <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">?</tt> block.
