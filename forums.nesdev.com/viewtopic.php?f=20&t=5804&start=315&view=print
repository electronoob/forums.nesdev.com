If you are booting it without the menu then you'll need to fix the checksum if using the [BF] version instead of the normal version. I never tested the fix on a real cartridge so the fix may only fix one issue. I don't plan on investigating it further.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you can get information on the cartridge's registers it would help to patch those games. But I'm only familiar with the SmartCard that this thread is all about. I imagine the problem is similar in nature where the game is writing an area that on the original cartridge would do nothing but on the flash cart's hardware overwrites its special registers. Certainly though he should have added a disable for the flash cart registers to prevent this unlike the SmartCard which seems to lack that. I'm pretty sure the EverDrive GB has a proper method to protect all flash cart registers from being modified after leaving the menu system.

Yeah that's fair, I am fairly certain his flash cart works in a similar manner as the smart card usb, as patches you guys have worked on have worked on the ElCheapo as well. Yeah I'm not 100% sure, he may have tried to but ran into an issue for some reason, as far as I'm aware the card is still technically a prototype.
