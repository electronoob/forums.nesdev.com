Using dolphin to look for soundtracks in my own discs, roughly half seem to use pre-recorded audio and half don't.</div><br />Looking at them in Dolphin, Super Monkey Ball 1, 2, and F-Zero GX all use prerendered audio.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The GameCube hardware is claimed to support mixing 64 audio channels simultaneously, so I misspoke when I said softsynth. It's more like the SNES, PS1, and PS2.</div><br />I was always under the impression that everything after the PS1 didn't have dedicated sound hardware, like the N64 or the GBA (if you exclude the original GB sound channels), outside of a channel for each speaker. With how fast CPUs got, I wouldn't have thought hardware developers would bother. 64 channels is overkill for any scenario I can think of, (how could anyone differentiate that many sounds?) but proportional to the SNES's 8 channels and the PS1's 24 channels, it would actually be the weakest part of the system by far. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />If modern systems (or at least the GameCube) still have dedicated sound hardware, what's the point in having all the audio being prerendered? You can't do much if there are vocals, but most modern game music does not. While some games are actually performed by an orchestra and recorded, I can't imagine they make up the majority. I also imagine the sound hardware is powerful enough to where you can use any kind of effect that you want to, so that's not a reason either. Convenience seems like it would be the main reason, as you don't have to program a music engine, although I'm sure an SDK would include this.

Translating mixing instructions from whatever DAW your composer/musician/recording engineer favors to whatever the platform library supports is harder than not bothering, and modern audio codecs aren't enough less space efficient than sample bank  + sequence data.

The PC Engine CD library is a gold mine of early 90's synthetic Japanese game music from an era where they were just transitioning from purely FM sounds to redbook audio and weren't completely sure of what to do with all the extra fidelty, so they just went all in, combining sweet FM synthesizers with electric guitars and whatnot, while still keeping production completely electronic as no video game developer could afford fully orchestrated recording sessions.<br /><br />A few more great example from less legendary games:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYfP680gQEc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYfP680gQEc</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-IuvOoXB_g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-IuvOoXB_g</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3RS0SGhCjk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3RS0SGhCjk</a><!-- m --><br />The MegaCD was in on it:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaAVsZgvIOM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaAVsZgvIOM</a><!-- m --><br /><br />For modern games, I'd say some games that really stand out are the<strong> Jet Set Radio</strong> ones, employing pop style music to help underline the fresh, contemporary style of the games. The original soundtracks by Sega's own Hideki Naganuma is amazing:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbdDr3sK96I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbdDr3sK96I</a><!-- m --><br /><br />And in the opposite ballpark, <strong>Dragon Quest 8</strong> stood out by being the only game in the main series to actually have an ingame orchestrated soundtrack for its western release (something that was actually omitted in the Japanese release).<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg236zrHA40">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg236zrHA40</a><!-- m --><br />I think this is really interesting, considering all the music in the series, even since the very first NES game, was obviously created with a symphonic orchestration in mind, and usually translated very poorly to synthetic video game instruments, losing many of their amazing subtleties in the process. While especially egregious on the NES, even the modern remakes on the DS don't really sound too good compared to the amazing symphonic recordings that have always accompanied the series.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Sexy Parodius (PS/PSX).</div><br />Only have the Saturn version of that, but as far as I recall, it's just recorded straight off the arcade board, isn't it?<br />Oshaberi Parodius got a complete overhaul for its PS1/Saturn incarnation though, including new soundtracks:<br />The Goemon stage particularly stands out: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMrEX0H5Pes">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMrEX0H5Pes</a><!-- m --><br />And of course the hidden (activated using a code) vocal version of the Tokimeki Memorial song: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzzrm-dq9c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzzrm-dq9c</a><!-- m -->

AFAIK the soundtrack is identical between the two systems, but -- and I'm being incredibly pedantic here (word-wise), so feel free to slap me -- I don't think the PS/PSX version is just &quot;a recording of the arcade version&quot;, as the audio quality is very clear/crisp.  It's more likely that it's a recording from whatever the true/original sound source was.<br /><br />I played the Saturn version back in the mid-90s and I remember it being on par with the PS/PSX (soundtrack and quality-wise).<br /><br />Which reminds me: Gradius Deluxe Pack (PS/PSX, Saturn) also has a great soundtrack, but it's Gradius and Gradius II from the arcade, so I don't know if it really counts with regards to this thread subject.  I will say that the audio between the PS/Saturn release and the arcade differs -- it's in stereo on the former systems, the spoken voice samples are higher quality, the sound effects (enemy deaths, etc.) seem different, and some of the music just sounds different (sounds like it's played at a slightly different frequency base).  But I'm nitpicking and don't wanna get off-topic.

I don't know quite what it is, but the music just feels a lot &quot;weaker&quot;, and I know I'm not the only one who feels this way.</div><br />Even I who am more fond of older games, I completely disagree with this. Many more modern games have amazing soundtracks and they are not a single bit weaker than soundtrack from older games. Of course you could find games with bad music but that's true for any console generation.
