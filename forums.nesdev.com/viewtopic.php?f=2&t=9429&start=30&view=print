		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I guess I could get into some more general stuff..<br /><br />Game Designers who assume the player will do it their way.<br />Forcing a certain play style will always fail.  I personally had no trouble with the first level in God of War but was completely devoid of talent regarding the Dragons Lair/Simon Says key press sequences.  With no way to complete the level I promptly took out the disc and never played again.<br /><br />Disallowing back-tracking<br />Especially important in RPGs.  Not only does entrapment in a current area feel extremely linear but it disallows additional leveling if needed.<br /><br />Invisible walls and rooster-blocking<br />Nothing is more game breaking than an invisible wall.  Pointless flavor-text to entrap the player in the current event is also frustrating.  Give real, physical reasons the player cannot progress.<br /><br />Negative Reinforcement<br />Equipment wear.  Starvation.   Realism for the sake of realism.  Anything that penalizes the player for not playing as intended.

Nazo no Murasamejou takes a hit in playability because enemies can shoot at an angle while you're restricted to two axes.  The lack of diagonal movement in Startropics and Zelda I is acceptable because most enemy attacks (Except for some bosses) don't move diagonally, either.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXLEtKo5jcY&amp;t=2m40s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXLEtKo5jcY&amp;t=2m40s</a><!-- m -->

Select and Start buttons are hard to reach during action.</div><br />The A button on the Mega Drive is horribly hard to reach too (the thumb is only ready to press two buttons at any time and it usually sits between B and C, making A pretty hard to use in practice), yet many games use the A button constantly (while also using the C button as their main action). You're meant to leave the third action as an exception you rarely have to use.<br /><br />And the problem here is that we have been taught that Start is pause, so making it anything other than pause is just plain unintuitive.

Nevertheless, if you don't think about it correctly you may go wrong, and many people tend to do it wrong (although some are thinking and realize what is wrong so as not to try it). In one level there is a corridor of lava with two potions: kill enemies (destroys most creatures in the board), and wind (which causes the player to move in random directions until it expires; the player can still move normally as well, and the movements are added together). Just so you don't forget: They aren't mislabeled. Nothing is mislabeled; they are all labeled correctly. Some people think the kill enemies potion is good and the wind is just to trick you, you have to escape quickly before you fall in the lava. And then they say, the water is flowing to the west, how can you go east, that is impossible? Actually the level will become unwinnable if you use the kill enemies (it is apparent if you actually look at the screen and see the consequences of what is done), and the wind potion should be moved elsewhere to use it; this is how you get across the water. In addition, there is a shortcut very visible that still many people fail to see somehow. (At least in this game you can save/restore any time and make multiple save files. The in-game help file (accessible anywhere) even tells you to make multiple save files a lot, and still most players ignore this.)</li><li>In some text adventure game I made once, you have limited inventory, which is important since the game is otherwise unwinnable. There is one room with a mind control device tell you to &quot;PICK UP THE BOMB&quot; (it will explode once picked up). To survive, you have to enter with full inventory, so that when it tell you to do so, you get a message telling you your hands are already full. Later you can get a spell of unlimited inventory, and then you have to come back in, yes there is a way but let's see if you can think of the solution? (In this game too, you can save/restore any time and make multiple save files.)</li><li><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign" class="postlink">tvtropes</a>: Better would be: On the wall is a button and a closed door near it (with no handle or anything). There is a sign on the button labeled &quot;Inorganic Vaporizer Ray&quot;. There is a sign on the door labeled &quot;Push button to open door&quot; and an arrow pointing to the button on the wall. Pushing the button opens the door and activates the vaporizer ray; but the vapoizer ray effect is time-delayed (with no hint as to this), and there are some objects you need to destroy in this way, while other objects you must prevent from used with this; but you can use the time delay to your advantage if you manage to figure it out after it happen to you!</li><li><a href="http://jeremydouglass.com/images/forums/2007/if-cruelty-redux.png" class="postlink">if-cruelty diagram</a>: Better would be: You find a key, cross the bridge, find a door to open so maybe you should go back to get the key. But actually you need to do that later not now; for now you should find another path. (And anyways, the bridge is broken now.) If you got the key right away, someone will steal it from you, open the door and activate the self-destruct sequence.</li></ul>
