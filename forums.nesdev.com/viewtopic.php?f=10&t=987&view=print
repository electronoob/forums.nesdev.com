I mean, how much do you know about programming and emulators as a whole. You have come to the right place for help but what I am saying is are you sure that you are up for programming such a complicated program such as an emulator?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd have to agree with WedNESday this time. This kind of thing is excessively documented already. And it is really hard when someone shows up here, asks "so, what's the deal with that?" and expects people to go through all of it from the beginning. I don't think people here will act like teachers, teaching a whole course. However, when you read the documents, try to code something, and for whatever reason it does not work as you expected, and then come here for some help it is easier to help. Easier for you and for us.
<br />
<br />Quick explanation of the tables and how they relate to each other:
<br />
<br /><strong>Pattern tables:</strong> These are your boxes of tiles, each with a different drawing on them. There are 2 boxes, one for the background and one for sprites. There are 256 kinds of tiles in each box, and you can use any kind as many times as you want.
<br />
<br /><strong>Name tables:</strong> these are the "walls" you can place your tiles on. Imagine your kitchen's walls, with spaces for many tiles. You take the tiles from the box and place them in your wall in any way you want.
<br />
<br /><strong>Attribute tables:</strong> These define the color of your tiles after they have been placed on the wall. I'd stay away from these until the other 2 are understood, if I were you.

<br />Sure, an accurate introductory tutorial for beginners covering the basics of putting a background in place and moving a few sprites would be great. Too bad my teaching skills suck and I don't have much time.
<br />
<br />That is the most difficult thing you know, understanding how a game console works, as most are used to PC programming, or even no programming at all. I had a really hard time going from DOS (qbasic, pascal) to the NES. Learning how assembly language works was harder than understanding how the PPU works for me. For newer programmers the transition must be even harder, as all people learn these days are the "visual" stuff, and have very little understanding on how the machine is actually controlled.
