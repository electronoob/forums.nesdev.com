As long as it's in good nature and not malicious intent, a game based on just an experience or surprise is perfectly fine. <br /><br />&quot;Games&quot; like that might not do well commercially for obvious reasons, but this competition is not about commercial viability. It's about encouraging people to make cool things for the NES.  People don't tend to buy a competition multicart with the primary motivation of getting great games -- they do it because they are interested in what the community comes up with, and want to support that. Limiting that just because you don't personally like a certain type of game design doesn't seem like a useful decision to me.

Sometimes I feel like small changes are ok, for my game's description some of the text got clipped off and I didn't mind because I felt like I made a political statement on it by accident:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You are a cute unidentified lifeform that, for some reason, has to break walls of different layouts. <s>Some people theorize that he&#39;s an alien that picked up transmissions of the Reagan speech which had the famous quote &quot;Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!&quot; and came a little bit late to the party.</s></div><br /><br />I just thought it was a stupid little joke about the Berlin Wall and stray TV signals in space but I completely forgot about Donald Trump's Build the Wall campaign, I honestly instantly regretted submitting that blurb into the competition email. Not sure if it was cut because of that or just for the sake of brevity but I didn't mind either way. But what if I did want the whole text reproduced on the menu screen? Outside of technical reasons that's a very tough question to answer.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think mentioning Raegans famous wall speech (which is just a piece of recent history that happened) is pretty innocuous? I guess anything that could be tied to politics or national sovereignty is a slippery slope, but for example &quot;sinking feeling&quot; seemed to be well recieved all around. It was a joke, and it played on a diplomatic schism, but all in all it was innocently made. <br /><br />#1 thing to avoid: caricatures, especially caricature of a political standpoint, religious belief or precarious position in the social strata.

I don't want everyone thinking they have to outdo each other with a first episode twist in imitation of the visual novel <em>Doki Doki Literature Club</em>, as if <em>Pikmin</em> were described as a game about Olimar piloting the <em>Dolphin</em>.<br /><br />One possible policy is &quot;Give full control of the description and screenshot to the entrant, within the limits of width, height, and color.&quot; Do we want this to extend as far as leaving spelling errors alone, or inconsistency in how the buttons are named?<br /><br />Or we could allow an entrant to elect full control at the cost of allowing only 15 lines of description with <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">[sic]</tt> on its own line afterward.

If they have time, they get back to you and inform you of the changes, but because it's a daily print, there's just no time to ping-pong edits back and forth. <br /><br />If you're writing an article for an biannual journal, you'd expect to have editorial feedback and a mutual agreement between author and editor being part of the process.

For something like that, I'd just suggest you let people create their own descriptions, but as an editor, help to correct errors or suggest slight improvements. There's a BIG difference between &quot;I completely changed your description because I didn't like it&quot; and &quot;I've fixed a typo and reformatted this slightly to make it work better.&quot;
