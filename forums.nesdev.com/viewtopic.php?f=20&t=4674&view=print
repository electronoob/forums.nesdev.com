		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, oddly with a system as big as Gameboy Color is, I can't seem to find any good documents about it. Everything I find is about the original Gameboy with some minor mentions of Color GameBoy, but absolutely no details on GameBoy Color additions like DMA, Extra VRAM, Toggling CPU Speed, etc. 
<br />
<br />Does anyone know where to get good and complete GBC information? It seems GB and GBC documentation can't compare to the NES documents that are available.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />IIRC, there wasn't much added for the GBC upgrade. Heh - but it's been a long time since I've touched GB/C dev. CPU speed, another bank of vram, an additional DMA mode or something. That's all I can remember. Anyway...
<br />
<br /> The GBColor cribsheet should give you the memory mapped registers you're looking for - <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pcedev.net/gbc/GBCribSheet000129.pdf">http://pcedev.net/gbc/GBCribSheet000129.pdf</a><!-- m --> . (Some GBC stuff on page 3)
<br />
<br /> Here's the original GB cribsheet in case... dunno.. here - <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pcedev.net/gbc/GBCribSheet.pdf">http://pcedev.net/gbc/GBCribSheet.pdf</a><!-- m --> .

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The GBC may not have added "much" but if it had a damned backlight it would have been quite a worthy improvement. More VRAM for more tiles, color, 2x CPU speed, DMA to VRAM. Not too shabby in my opinion. 
<br />
<br />I'd swear I'd seen that cribsheet before and it didn't have any of the register listings like the one you linked me here. I think I have the information I need now.

It's sad that there's so little info and basically not even ruins or fossils left by a GBCdev community. I don't even know if one existed. Well at least there's this little documentation, which is pretty much all you need to know (though there are probably hardware quirks that aren't documented, but oh well, I guess).

That was done in asm but I wanted to make an 8-way scrolling map using C.  Then I noticed the compiler doesn't do 16-bit math so the heck with it.

<br /> It's too bad the PCE wasn't a little faster. I'd try to emulate the original GB <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br /> Who knows, I still might try it out for a game or two. After all - not all games use 100% cpu resource.

The PCE has plenty of open bus areas in the upper 2meg range where I can easily map in some extra ram, but I doubt I can convince any PCE emulator authors to support it even if I have it setup and working on my rom board  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  But now I'm getting off topic..

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's what I'm doing though, trying to emulate it. However right now the issue is probably cpu core development and emulating registers to get games to run. Right now I got Dr. Mario partially running. But it's not running correctly yet. It'll be awhile till I figure out what the deal is with it. I seem to remember someone saying that GB was easier than the NES but I seriously think they are wrong. The NES was not near as difficult for me to start emulating. I've only been at the GB for a few days but I honestly didn't think I'd have this much trouble getting simple games working.
