My artist uses Photoshop, and I use <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/" class="postlink">Paint.NET</a> to rearrange things when they need to be. I sometimes try to convince her to use Paint.NET as well because Photoshop is kinda overkill, but meh. She's used to it. Haha<br /><br />As for emulators I use FCEUX and Nestopia primarily, sometimes Nintendulator. Test on hardware with PowerPAK.

But I don't really see how this can be a more comfortable way to work with the music than Famitracker.

Its an 040 so, yeah it will be slower, but 64tass compiles on m68K so I don't need to change tools. Being able to draw something in DP-V on the one machine would make life easier. Seeing the images on a CRT while I draw them etc. Having the machine singular focus with no distractions would probably boost my productivity too. But sadly I wouldn't be able to run VICE to test with, but I could probably just put it on the Raspberry Pi and use the remote monitor to control it from the Amiga. I mean an 040 Amiga is probably overkill for such a task <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
