It's that time again: AGDQ was on this week, raising money for Prevent Cancer Foundation.<br /><a href="https://gamesdonequick.com" class="postlink">Main page.</a><br />Also-useful links:<br /><a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule" class="postlink">Run schedule.</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eB4mJA3DV5D_gYAEp2lLMXQqqTZLlQRJDsTQOOoVvR8/pubhtml" class="postlink">(Googledocs mirror of schedule.)</a><br /><a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/tracker/12" class="postlink">Donation tracker.</a> (Has subpages of what challenges/bid wars/prizes are available, and a duplicate schedule too)<br /><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/2ra5rw/agdq_vods_thread_2015/" class="postlink">The reddit thread,</a> <s>usually the first place to find links to the starts of completed runs on the Twitch recordings.</s> Someone's very technically on-the-ball, &quot;unofficial&quot; youtube uploads are available for everything I checked.<br /><br />I was told that #AGDQ2015 is the hashtag of choice, though I do not twit.<br /><br />Twelve hours in, $100k in simple donations already. Prior viewercount record (~110k?) surpassed just a few runs in.<br /><br />The TAS block(s) were great this year: [rot13 as spoiler-damping mechanism] Gurl nppbzcyvfurq jung gurl bayl jnagrq gb ynfg gvzr: FZJ-qryvirerq cnlybnq bs FZO1. Gura Cbxrzba Cynlrq Gjvgpu.<br /><br />The lineup look(ed) great this year. (Of probably interest to this crowd are Kaizo Mario World, Battle Kid, and many other NES/FamiCom titles, though I encourage looking at the schedule/possibly saving a copy. Games may be being cut for time, but a friend asked about one they were interested in and it got re-added, so they are being responsive.)<br /><br />edit: AGDQ 2015 is over now. While they didn't succeed in continuing the trend of super-exponential money growth they'd had (of more-than-doubling each year), $1.5M is still a few hundred grand more than last year.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6603">Myask</a> â€” Sun Jan 04, 2015 10:15 pm</p><hr />
