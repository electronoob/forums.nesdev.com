		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So just futzing around with a simple fade screen transition.  I have the palette in RAM and have a routine that updates that ram.  The palette is updated in the NMI.  I have a routine (LoadPaletteRam) that I can call which changes a palette (uses variable backgroundPaletteOffset to pull values from the correct place in a table).  That's all working.  But I can't get any sort of gradual fade.  <br /><br />I figured something like the following would work - the X register SHOULD work as a timer.  However the result still appears as instantaneous...from first palette to last palette rather than showing one at a time.  I generally understand why - I'd venture that all the math is happening before the NMI displays the result, giving the impression it was just a single &quot;change&quot; rather than four &quot;changes&quot;, but I thought I'd at least share this as my first idea for it.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ScreenTransition:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LDX #$20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; load 20 into x to act as a countdown<br />FadeOut:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DEX&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; after counts down from 20 to 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BNE FadeOut<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LDA backgroundPaletteOffset&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CLC<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ADC #$10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; increase the table offset by a 'row'<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CMP #$40&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; the highest 'row' is 40<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BPL doneFadingOut&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; if it has reached 40, get out of the routine<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; STA backgroundPaletteOffset&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; if not, keep the new value<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TAY<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; JSR LoadPaletteRam&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;; in this routine, what is in y determines where in the table to grab values from<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; JMP ScreenTransition&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; start it over again with the countdown<br />doneFadingOut:<br /></div><br /><br /><br />There's nothing *wrong* with this code - it does exactly what I'm telling it to do, but it's happening all before the screen is updated (my conjecture), so the effect is never seen.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I handle fades by subtracting $10 for a few frames, $20 for a few frames, and finally $30 for a few frames before blanking the screen and loading the new graphics into video memory. See, for example, (I think) <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">load_faded_palette</tt> in src/help.s in <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=139311#p139311" class="postlink">my FizzBuzz project</a>.<br /><br />On the NES, you'll probably have to live with a stepwise fade. Changing only part of the palette won't work well because, for example, the sky color will change only in steps. It's the same reason <a href="https://twitter.com/PinoBatch/status/555365347050536963" class="postlink">you'll never see a game based on <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em></a>. To minimize the problem, make fades reasonably fast; for example, don't wait 15 frames for each step. But don't make it too fast either, or the player won't be able to see the fade at all.

I was using that method to make X into a timer, but that is not counting frames...it's just decreasing many times PER frame, so I don't see the gradual result.<br /><br />Conceptually, that's very similar to what I'm doing, but I think my idea for timing it is what's throwing me off.  <br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />**EDIT: nevermind.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A few things:<br /><br />1. Your palette should be uploaded to the PPU during vblank and nowhere else. Even if you created a much longer delay than your 32 x DEX BEQ, you would have to wait for the next vblank to apply the palette changes anyway. It might work on some emulators, but it will fail on hardware. Also, even if you were changing the palette mid-frame, what the user would see is an image that gets progressively darker in bands from top to bottom, and the effect would only be seen for a single frame.<br /><br />2. 32 x DEX BEQ is a wait length equivalent to about two scanlines. You need to increase your order of magnitude a couple of times if you want the delay to be noticeable to the user. Though, as you've noticed, it's usually better to count NMIs for that purpose.<br /><br />3. You can find out how long your delay took by several methods. Here's a few:<br />- <a href="http://www.obelisk.demon.co.uk/6502/reference.html" class="postlink">look up</a> the instructions in the loop and count cycles, and learn how long a cycle takes<br />- use a debugger to count cycles (FCEUX has a cycle counter on the right-middle of its debug panel)<br />- <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_registers#Mask_.28.242001.29_.3E_write" class="postlink">write to $2001</a> to change the emphasis bits immediately, this will show you visually onscreen when the instruction took place (FCEUX doesn't support more than one emphasis change per frame very well, though, should use Nintendulator or real hardware for this one)<br /><br />4. You've probably heard this already, but $0D is a &quot;forbidden&quot; colour, so when fading out it's important to prevent this if you're using the greys from the $XD column. My method is just to avoid that column entirely, but if you are using it you need special logic to prevent the &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46kXH6GGtT0" class="postlink">none more black</a>&quot; $0D that will confuse many televisions (another thing emulators won't show).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Rainwarrior - thanks for the input.  Definitely don't even have to think it out all that much though...I just needed to figure out how to count frames...which I already am doing.  As soon as I wrote it out as part of this post, I had a forehead-smacking moment.  The fact I am having those tells me I'm making progress in my understanding, at least, it's just not second nature quite yet.  It happened yesterday, too.  As of now I can feed the subroutine a 'fadeSpeed' variable and get whatever length speed I want (in frames).  It works just as I wanted it to. <br /><br />The look up cycles count though definitely helps!  <br /><br />Tepples - dude, &quot;rubber duck debugging&quot;, or some variant, is definitely making its way into the documentary.  Ha!  Now I suppose I have to figure out what's an even more ridiculous inanimate object that a rubber duck that would be sensible (or the most nonsensical possible) to be at my work desk!

Everything in a game should be timed in frames, and should not hog the CPU. Each part of the game has to update itself for the next frame only, and free the CPU so that other parts can do the same, otherwise the whole program will pause, and that's hardly the effect you're going for (and even when it is, there are basic maintenance tasks that still have to be performed and shouldn't be paused).<br /><br />Like any other entity in the game, it's important that you maintain the state of the fading animation so that you know what to do about that particular task every frame. The first information you need is a flag indicating whether the game is fading. If it isn't, you can simply skip the fading code altogether. If it is fading, you have to know if it's fading in or out (a variable could have 3 states: not fading, fading in, fading out), what the current brightness is, and how long to wait before advancing to the next brightness level. That should be all the state you need.<br /><br />With this setup, initiating a fading sequence would require resetting the delay, setting the brightness level to the minimum or maximum, and setting the type of fade (in or out). After that, the fade code will start to run every frame (because a fade in our out has been signaled, as opposed to no fading), with a logic similar to this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">- decrement delay;<br />- if delay is 0:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - make a copy of the palette adjusted according to the current brightness level;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - if the target brightness has not been reached:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - update the brightness according to the type of fade;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - reset delay;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - if the target brightness has been reached:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - change the state to &quot;not fading&quot;;</div><br /><br />Or something along these lines. Just keep in mind that everything in a game is part of something bigger, so it can't take over the CPU and use all of the system resources exclusively for itself indefinitely. Each part of the game (be it the scrolling engine, the camera, the player, the enemies, the fading animations, whatever) is an entity with a state, and a piece of logic that runs every frame to control that state. This ensures that each part of the engine gets its own slice of time to take care of itself and everything will appear to be running in parallel, like is supposed to be in a game.

I have a feeling it would look more realistic to kind of &quot;scale&quot; the colors down, given a brightness level. So if there were 5 brightness levels, they would represent 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and 0%. You would have a look up table for each level of brightness, where you see what color it would be at 100%, and use that as an index in the other tables to see what color it becomes at that brightness.<br />Because when I think about it, at 50% brightness, color $35 should become $15, and color $15 should perhaps become $05 instead of black (because you halved the brightness of that color).<br /><br />The other good thing about the tables approach is that it wouldn't have to stay in the same &quot;hue&quot; in the palette. So $35 doesn't have to change to $3x, it can change to $2x, if you want.

I mean, even if you want everything to look still during fades (which is not what happens in movies, BTW), I'm sure thete's some sort of low level maintenance that would ideally keep going. I don't know, it sounds to me like bad practice to hijack all the resources for a single task.<br /><br />As for the actual color processing, I'm with Celius. Tables allow for smoother fades than the ridiculous 4 step sequence you can get with usual methods. If I can't waste much space on such tables, I at least arrange the colors in a made up way that's more friendly for doing math (e.g. I won't land on forbidden colors) and use a single table for converting colors in that format into what the NES actually uses.
