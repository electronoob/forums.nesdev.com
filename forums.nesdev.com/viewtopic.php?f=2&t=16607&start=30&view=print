It was not perfect, the color were off, but the jailbars were still clearly there. Not as visible than on the original RGB signal, but exactly the same pattern.<br /><br />So I guess we can rule out the corruption of the video signal after the PPU<br /><br />So what do we have left ?<br /><br />PS : I also changed the CPU... same result.

(Probably. I think we've eliminated the capacitive coupling option?)<br /><br />The power supply needs to be a lot firmer (more capacitors, with less ESR, a mix of both ceramic and electrolytic, shorter wires) to reduce the amount of visible jailbars.<br /><br />Perhaps try moving the place where you supply the extra bonus 5V supply across the PPU's power and ground pins (if it's further away)
