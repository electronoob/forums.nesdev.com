		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Cannot for life of me seem to get X2 board to work with 29f033c chips with wires and those buyicnow boards. My goal is to have X2 with a &quot;start with armor&quot; game genie patch and i think im very close. I have almost exhausted myself researching this as most of the info i can find people are trying to put together a megaman x2 and x3 board using retrostage super fx converters. I am presuming these boards are just a cleaner and easier option as they all seem to have the same address(?). <br /><br />I have attempted to get this going by populating both slots on the board with a 27c801 and a 27c101 (1mb + 512kb) and two 27c801 (1mb + 1mb [mirrored?]) and a 29f033c chip as well with some results...<br /><br />I normally play this patched rom via the superufo pro 8 with my Rockman X2 in the top and every &quot;experiment&quot; ive tried gives me different results. I like to use the superufo's &quot;play cart&quot; option for all my repros as it gives the message &quot;no cartridge&quot; when my soldering is bad. <br /><br />With the 27c801 it seems to boot but the graphics freeze as a garbled mess of sprites replacing x riding the bike appears and promptly locks up. <br /><br />I finally got the 29f033c to read as a cart through the super ufo but it locks up DIRECTLY as the capcom logo dissapears. I read that byuu said to patch the rom by changing address #$01 to #$00 but ive no idea how to do that. <br /><br />The messed up sprites could also be board damage i suppose. Anyone else have any luck with this board? Ideally I would die to have it be x2 &amp; X3 but i have no clue what an &quot;and&quot; gate is or how to wire it up...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In order to start Rockman X2 with just one MaskROM instead of 2 either works by hacking the game OR connecting your 29F033 /CE to GND and A21 of 29F033 to the /CE pad on MaskROM0 to control lower and upper bits.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sweet lord I finally got it... (About 500 points of soldering later...) Rockman X2 with my patch is now running beautifully. Wired up /ce from chip to gnd on board. send /ce from board to a20 and then tie a21, vcc, and a22 to gnd. did not add mirroring. voila. <br /><br />Update: Mirrored last 512kb to make rom 2mb then merged with rockman x3 and added a switch. Just took gnd off a22 and connected to vcc to run x3 on lower half of chip. Kept the switch inside until i can get a reset counter chip...<br /><br /> oh btw on another note i also found a &quot;new project zero 3&quot; rom that works on copiers. Its 4mb so i cant use it with this project but i would like people to know about it as i thought project zero didnt run on copiers! One noticeable difference is that it does not say 2015 or whatever at the beginning...
