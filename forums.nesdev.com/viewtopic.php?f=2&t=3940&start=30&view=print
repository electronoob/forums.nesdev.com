<br />- "Hey, why not do a format that describe every transistors and connexions that are in the chip of a cartridge in a huge text file so that the emulator can emulate the game accurately ?"
<br />- "No that won't be accurate enough, we absolutely need a format describing every atom in the cartridge for proper emulation !"
<br />
<br />For me a game, so it's ROM image, is an "idea" not a material, hence the idea should be emulated no the material.

This way, the main format doesn't change at all (INES), and for people who <em>must</em> preserve everything, an external package of boxart/screenshot/what-have-you could be added.
<br />
<br />Adding extra bullshit reduces the ease of hex editing or manually tweaking existing things, and reduces distributabilty.
<br />
<br />A database could be built off the ROM image portion (using a hash/checksum/whatever) and ignoring the header, so that if broken headers are a problem they can be fixed... the tool to do this automatically could even have a "Mark as unknown/corrupt"/etc option for unknown ROM images.
<br />
<br />...
<br />
<br />In short: I think this format sucks.

<br />A database is useless for homebrew, translations, and hacks where the checksum will be changed.  There must be a way for the end user to set the hardware instantly.  No reason a prg/chr checksum database couldn't be used to FIX the bad headers of existing files tho.

Older emulators wouldn't read the extra data, and newer ones could check for its existance and act on it if needed. I think that's a simple and effective solution, and would be very easy to use by homebrew developers and hackers. Just add something like 32 bytes at the end to put a standardized board name.

<br />
<br />It really seems like the best idea is to just convert iNES ROMs to iNES2 en masse and begin building an <em>external, <strong>optional</strong></em> database off of that. 
<br />
<br />It can even be set up like the GoodSets, with a central site to report new ROMs/broken headers/broken ROMs that could be auto-repaired with the next release.

Thousands of ROMs wouldn't be changed in a short period of time, a few ones would due to the rom hacking scene, and another ones as homebrew stuff. I can't see a problem updating the database, since every emulator I know does that (MAME related). Though, it does NOT make the iNES format be gone.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The focus shouldn't be eradicating the iNES format. Rather, fixing the problems that it has introduced.
<br />
<br />I am reminded of Geiger's SNES9x debugger, in which he requires the SMC ROM header be stripped. If the user choses "No" the emulator closes the ROM. In the end, you get two choices: modify the ROM, or don't use it. This is a bad solution to what the author thought was a real problem. Instead, the header could have been ignored internally; transparent to the user, and everyone's happy.
<br />
<br />In this case, Disch already pointed out that an emulator supporting this XML+BIN format will be doing plenty of internal restructuring, no matter what format the actual ROM takes.
<br />
<br />Any way, I'm starting to get off topic, but my point is don't force your magical fix-all solution onto anyone; <strong>MAKE - IT - OPTIONAL</strong>. You can have your databases and your XML+BIN ROMs, but don't bother making your emulators or tools insist that I "update" my stuff for "new features".

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the only way this would every really catch on is if there was an "export to XML from iNES" or "export to iNES from XML" application. 
<br />
<br />The other problem is that the user DOESN'T care how the rom is stored, he just wants to play. The only people who care are developers, and unless we can make the transition seemless (which we can't because all the rom sites aren't going to just randomly change to a new format because we said so--hell we can't even decide on which format is the best), then this isn't ever going to happen.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Again, I'll remember everyone that the board name tell us nothing :
<br />
<br />- A UNROM game can have either a 74HC32 or a 74HC08 (very uncommon), either making the high or low PRG area switched, those are different mappers, but both are UNROM. The same apply for japanese CNROM games with 8KB CHRROM
<br />- A game can use a TLROM or MC-ACC board and still have exactly the same results, the differences between both boards doesn't exist and nobody will ever care to call them different.
<br />- Most japanese non-Ninendo made boards have no names, or really crap names.
<br />
<br />Finally, XML shucks and stinks and is completley overrated (exept when it comes to do HTML and still...). Why waste about 20 bytes of thext for those &lt;stuff&gt;&lt;/stuff&gt; when the same thing could be exprimed with 2 bits ?

The way I see it, this new format is meant for preservation only (iNES2 can still exist for everything else: gaming, development, romhacking). The emulator, Nestopia in this case, is used as a tool to see if the data/info extracted from the board is accurate.
<br />
<br />"preservationists" should be aware though that this is not the ultimate format, it's done in steps. 10 years ago we thought iNES was enough, 20 years from now, the information we have currently will probably be seen as lacking.
