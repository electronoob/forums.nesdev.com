		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been meaning to program an all direction scrolling game. Like Crystalis. My main stumbling block, is I can't think of how to compress each 'room' (16x15 set of metatiles, which expands to 256x240 pixel area).<br /><br />In an ideal world, the game should only need to find the exact metatiles for the next 16 pixels to the right, but once it's compressed, there's no easy way to do that...to uncompress just the exact metatiles I need.<br /><br />So, in my head, I'm going to need to uncompress 4 full rooms into the RAM at any given time (since you can stand in the corner of 4 different rooms at the same time). That's going to eat up $400 bytes of RAM + Some bytes for a buffer of tiles needed to push to the PPU the next v-blank.<br /><br />Anyway. It's not very simple.<br /><br />And, without compression, the game might be very small, or need lots of bank switching, which is a whole other level of complexity, that might not suit a beginning tutorial.<br /><br />Edit, on second thought, I should be able to fit 64 rooms (8x8) on an NROM sized game 242x64 = 15488 (extra 2 bytes for a pointer to the start of each room). Maybe I won't compress for the example code.<br /><br />Edit2, and if all the rooms were uncompressed, they wouldn't have to be loaded to the RAM. I'll think about it some more.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There are different types of compression that allow almost random access to individual metatiles. I particularly use metatiles (256x256) of metatiles (128x128) of metatiles (64x64) of metatiles (32x32) of metatiles (16x16). Traversing the metatile structure until the 16x16 ones isn't particularly slow. Of course this scheme isn't ideal for all kinds of maps, but I'm sure you can use something more accessible than &quot;RLE/LZ one whole room/screen into a solid binary block&quot;.

Represent the map as an (X, Y, thing) list, where the renderer calculates which objects overlap the column to be scrolled onto the screen. For an 8-way scroll, You'd probably need to sort this by (Y screen, X, Y within screen) so that you have only a couple 256-pixel-tall rows of objects to search. The advantage of objects over a quadtree is that repeated objects can be placed at arbitrary 16x16 tile offsets.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Another option: <br />Have a seamlessly repeating background picture (size of a screen, larger, or smaller, depending on style and how well it repeats without getting worn out), have it rle-compressed in ROM and keept it relatively simple so it doesn't get too big. Or if you can afford it, keep it uncompressed. Write it to screen first (in slices as you scroll). <br /><br />Then have a number of objects (kind of like metroid or what tepples said) which overwrites the basic background. You get the creative freedom/small file size-compromise of metroid but get a good looking background rather than an empty black void.
