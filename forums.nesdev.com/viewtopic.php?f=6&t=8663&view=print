<br />My second question is probably dumb, so I saved it for last. There's no chance whatsoever that MMC5's 8-bit PCM channel can also play 1-bit DPCM samples...... right?

<br />And the MMC5's PCM channel is completely worthless.  It doesn't do DMC.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Writing $0F/$1F to the sound channel enable register ($4015) works as long as a game isn't using these enable registers to turn off channels. It'd work with my music player, which uses the envelope registers ($4000/$4004/$4008/$400C) to turn off channels, but music players like SMB1 that make heavy use of the length counter might use $4015 instead.
<br />
<br />If you try to add samples to a game not designed with DPCM in mind, you might get garbage button presses while a sample is playing due to clock noise generated by the DMA unit. There are DPCM-safe controller reading routines, and there are DPCM-unsafe controller reading routines. The latter are simpler and faster, and they're actually required for peripherals where rereading has side effects (such as the Super NES Mouse and, if I remember correctly, the Vaus controller for Arkanoid).

<br />Try to understand where the popping comes from. It comes from sudden changes in volume, so if the DPCM counter is at a value other than zero when you write zero to it, it will pop. How loud the pop is depends on the previous value (going 127-&gt;0 or vice versa will produce the biggest pop).
<br />
<br />Then it's just a matter of trying to work around the issue, by doing stuff like what Dwedit suggested.
