		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was wondering what the chance is that things could be updated a bit.  I know it's extra work for Memblers, but I wanted to discuss it at least.  I hope you understand I don't want to offend anyone, it is a good resource but I feel it could be laid out better.
<br />
<br />nesdev.com is probably one of the first things people see when they decide they want to get into NES development - I know it was for me.  So when you have to scroll past 2 or 3 pages of text right off the bat, it can be briefly confusing and/or not very inviting.  I'd rather be hit up with a link to something useful right away.  I suppose we are, with the links to the forum and wiki, but that's not necessarily the first place a new person will look.
<br />
<br />First we see the updates section, which I can't help but think would be better suited elsewhere.  Changes occur so few and far between anyway, and new visitors don't usually care about recent changes.  I propose that minor updates could be posted at the bottom of the page, with a link to them under Notices.  Particularly noteworthy or awesome announcements such as competitions would still be fine for top of the page.
<br />
<br />The Notices section is necessary and worthwhile, people shouldn't be downloading the whole site off the webserver.  But is the 2004 MiniGame Compo still going on?  Do we need a link to the current message boards here when there is already a link at the top of the page?  Is Membler Industries still producing a nes dev cartridge?
<br />
<br />Then there is the site index, which is useful, but at the same time most other sites would relegate this sort of thing to a sidebar or menu, rather than having it in-line with the rest of the site.  It's a lot to scroll past.  Are the minor divisions needed, or would it be appropriate to go with just the 6 main headings so we can get to the content faster?
<br />
<br />And then before the general NES documentation, there is a music section which is separate from the music links section at the bottom.  Not sure why it should be there.
<br />
<br />The next thing is the most important: the text files section needs direction for new programmers.  I imagine a lot of people get here and click the first link, and become utterly confused at all the technical information without practical implementation.  So they scan downward for something easier, maybe a tutorial...and the first tutorial they see is GBAGuy's.  Don't we always tell people not to use it?  I can understand keeping it there for historical purposes, but it shouldn't be the first tutorial people have access to.
<br />
<br />How are the text files sorted?  It looks like it goes by date, with the most recent on top.  Generally this will also be in order of up-to-date usefulness, but there are plenty of reiterative, incomplete and mostly un-useful docs in the list.  The second one by Blue Hawk is too brief in its explanations and doesn't have the best writing.  "Programming that 8-bit beast of power" sounds friendly for newcomers, but it's incomplete in how it conveys its ideas and tries too often to be flippant/humorous to cover up a lack of explanation.  It also mentions getting a zip file at his site...which is now defunct.
<br />
<br />The PDF by Patrick Diskin is pretty good but also just a prettier retread of Jeremy Chadwick's documentation.  Both are among the most useful references available, so perhaps they could both be together at the top?  Could we label each document with a little explanation, like for nestech, "provides good technical info, but is incomplete on the subject of audio and practical programming."
<br />
<br />I notice there are a lot of architectural sorts of docs mixed in with the programming sorts of docs.  Maybe Text Files could be split into "Programming (new users start here!)" and "Technical Reference."
<br />
<br />Again, please don't take this personally, I love this site and the forums and the people here, I just think some better thought could go into laying out the main page.  I think the biggest improvement would be removing or relabeling GBAGuy's tutorial, and putting a link to Nerdy Nights right at the top.  It's something we can all relate to and explain well if people have further questions.

<br />
<br />That's just a few of the results from the past year or two.  Newcomers need guidance, and if we can make things easier for them it will result in less of the same old questions and more intelligent discussion.

<br />
<br />It depends which version you like. Do you prefer the "wikified" style with white background that is now more the norm or you still want to keep the original colors of nesdev?
<br />
<br />For the original colors, I was able to make it by overriding some CSS class but the problem is that is not always play nice with older browser so it has caveat. 
<br />
<br />Once you decide which page you like, we just redirect to it and start updating it.  Then me and Tepples can decide the rules for updating. For example, we can make a group for the main page update so not the latest spammer can deface the page.

<br />That would be pretty cool.  Similar to editing the wiki, any good standing nes devver could add their own files or links.
<br />
<br />If I have time I will look into editing the wiki.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I hadn't even realized that the wiki page was already cleaned up with most of what I had asked about originally.
<br />
<br />I edited your new CSS page and put in a table.  What do you guys think?  Too messy?  Just something I wanted to try out.
<br />

<br />
<br />On second look I think I hate it.  I wish there was a better way to line everything up without spacing it out so far.

Or putting the site on one of those 'content management' type setups, but IMHO most of the sites I've seen using that kind of stuff is pretty ugly (not that the current, old html is nice looking, but it is easily accessible at least).

<br />
<br />Yeah. There is 2 version of it: <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Nesdev" class="postlink">this one</a> which as the same style as the wiki and the one you tried to edit.
<br />
<br />The only problem with the one that look like nesdev is that I override some of the CSS to make it look as much as possible as the original nesdev page. The problem with that is older browser that doesn't support CSS well (cough! IE6 cough!)... It comes out not properly. I didn't have time yet to figure out a solution for this.
<br />
<br />As for the table, I don't know. It doesn't bring much yet. What I wanted to do (long time ago) when I proposed to update the main page too is that instead of having 1 huge page is to separate it by section that you can select form a menu on the top or left. 
<br />
<br />Still, for now I think the first goal should be to make that page more accessible to edit by the community (similar to what I did when the previous wiki server was failing all the time) so the content would be more up to date. Then after we can think on how to make it look better, content wise, color wise, organization wise.
