Which defeats the purpose of having customizable settings for <em>Windows Update</em> in the first place. I know it helps little to yell into the void but what are they thinking by doing so? <br /><br />For the work i lost naively assuming updates will always be run through WU, i got... some social feature (&quot;people&quot;) i'll never use pinned to my task bar (why would i want skype/email contacts there? would be a total clutter), and more weirdly got my touchpad settings reset (scrolling got reversed, left/right click division point got moved).

Automatic updates in Windows 10 close vulnerabilities more quickly than manual updates in previous versions of Windows.<br /><br />For many, the problem with switching from Windows to another operating system is that another operating system other than the one that shipped with a particular laptop is less likely to have drivers for its hardware. Only Macs are compatible with macOS, and not all laptops are compatible with GNU/Linux. Things like audio, WLAN, Bluetooth, backlight brightness, and suspend are the most commonly affected, and on something like an ASUS Transformer Book T100TA, <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/Asus/T100TA" class="postlink">all five of these still have problems in Debian testing</a>. And I'm under the impression that hardware support is one of the things keeping many users of GNU/Linux from trying FreeBSD.

Several years ago I also told my boss I won't use Windows again, even to save my job.  I knew that might result in my losing my job; but when I was on Windows, I was angry with the computer all the time, and wanted to throw it out the window.  It wasn't worth my health.  I did not lose my job though, and instead, the other engineer got into Linux because of what I said, and loved it.  On LInux, I can update anytime and be using the computer during the process.  I have heard you cannot do that with Windows.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">For many, the problem with switching from Windows to another operating system is that another operating system other than the one that shipped with a particular laptop is less likely to have drivers for its hardware.</div><br />Our son, who worked very successfully for a managed-services provider for a couple of years (but quit because it was too much desk work and not physical enough) was maintaining networks and taking care of clients' computer problems, and according to him, finding drivers was much <em>easier</em> in Linux than in Windows.

However there was recently a massive flaw found in ALL CPUs, particularly Intel CPUs that NEEDS to be patched and then a bunch of updates to help mitigate the performance costs of said fixes. And if you are a person who always does &quot;not now&quot; it eventually gets to the point where it realizes you don't know what is good for you and applies it. Really the updates on Windows are good things, and good for you.

This applies to every OS and not just Windows (for example, on my home FreeBSD stable/11 box, I specifically disabled PTI (Meltdown mitigation) and IBRS (Spectre mitigation) as the machine is single-user, on bare-metal, and on a private network).  Intel has botched these themselves once or twice already, as have enterprise vendors (HP I believe did, Dell rescinded theirs and re-did it), blah blah blah.  Yes, I suppose for generic end-users, the best thing to do is to apply BIOS updates (specifically for CPU microcode updates that allow for IBRS capability) and apply OS updates, but a large percentage of the users here are tech-savvy, not generic.  Use-case, environment, and demographic all matter.

Their source code is not available to the public for review. And I can't tell what you define as &quot;on a private network&quot;, in particular whether you intended to include the common case of a network using private network IP addresses (RFC 1918) that has a network address translation (NAT) gateway to the Internet.

We recently had to put together a new PC to work on a contract for a PS4/XBone game, and Windows 10 it was. I kinda hate that computer. It had a couple hardware/driver issues, and on top of that Windows X was much more annoying than I had expected.<br /><br />1a) You can't turn off the real time virus protection. Just schedule it to be off for a day.<br />1b) They moved the button for it several times already.<br />1c) The realtime protection seems to kick in any time the system is busy, and waste an entire CPU core doing it.<br />2a) Updates that apparently happen whenever they damn well please.<br />2b) Ex: Go to a short meeting, tell the boss &quot;yeah, I'll make a quick build with that&quot;, walk back to your computer and to find it installing updates for the next half an hour in the middle of your workday. -_-<br />3) &quot;Get Windows X&quot; Do I really need to say anything more?<br />4) For a while, it would ask me several times a week if I wanted to sign up for MS's DropBox clone. NO THANK YOU ALREADY!<br />5a) Relatively huge install size. We were rushed putting it together, and opted for a 256GB SSD because the 512GB we wanted was out of stock.<br />5b) To make it worse, the installer screwed up the partitioning, and 5GB of the SSD isn't even partitioned somehow!? By the time I noticed, it was too late to fix it without a lot of work.<br />5c) As a Unix guy, a compiler seems like an inseparable part of the OS, and VisualStudio's minimum install is also huge.<br />6) Configuration for what I've come to expect as basic features in other OSes seems to be a paid feature for Windows Professional.<br />7) Several instances of &quot;Pop-up ads&quot; in the OS itself trying to convince me to turn Contana back on. NO THANK YOU ALREADY!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Oziphantom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Unlike OSX where an update will usually uninstall 3 things and break 10 programs you where using <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div><br /><br />Say what? I mean Apple does drop support for stuff at major versions. Ex: OS 9 compatibility, PPC or 32 bit support, etc. I can't say I've ever heard of more than the rare problems from minor upgrades.<br /><br />My biggest beef with Apple nowadays is graphics. You can't buy a Mac at any price with a particularly great GPU, and they dropped the ball on API support. Metal is a really nice API, but it's not Vulkan, and it's missing functionality that even modern GL supports.
