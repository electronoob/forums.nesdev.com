<br />
<br />im starting an assembler class in a few days and am looking forward to seeing what i can do with old nes hardware.
<br />
<br />anyway, just wondering what programs are good for creating sprite characters.  i downloaded some games with the source code.  whare are the sprites located anyway.

<br />
<br />I went to the link supplied by Memblers, and grabbed BMP2NES.  I'm running into problems, though.  When I make a .bmp file, it's at 16 million colors.  So I converted it in a program called <a href="http://irfanview.com" class="postlink">Irfanview</a>.  Everything looks fine after doing that.  Then I run it through BMP2NES.  When I do, the image is all broken up and doesn't look right at all.  I've tried saving the image in MSPaint as a 256 color (8 bpp) and not converting it in Irfanview.  I still get the same effect.  
<br />
<br />Am I doing something horribly wrong?  Is there a better program that I can use to convert .bmp to .chr?

<br />
<br />red
<br />blue
<br />green
<br />black
<br />
<br />otherwise it won't show up. If you have any other color there it will show up as the bg color. It may be different for mac, but that's the senario with Windows. The same rules apply for bmp2chr. By the way, I'm not saying you're dumb or anything, but if it looks all screwed up, maybe you have incorrect dimensions. Make sure the image is 128x128, no bigger, no smaller, if you're using bmp2chr still after my wonderful advice. haha. Jk.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I almost always have trouble converting graphics too.  Seems like every converter to CHR has it's own way of dealing with the colors.
<br />
<br />YY-CHR is very nice, I haven't tried using it like Celius said, but I bet that'll work well.  The way I've had the best luck with converting graphics is by using Tile Molester.  Just be sure it goes to the right format, because Tile Molester has a lot of options, heheh.

Inserting it in a CHR file is doable, you don't need BMP2NES at all. I've used TileMolester to instert the new 4 color pitcure into NES format.
<br />Here you are an example :

<br />From this image : <a href="http://jonathan.microclub.ch/cat/minetbougie.jpg" class="postlink">http://jonathan.microclub.ch/cat/minetbougie.jpg</a>, I was able to input it in a NES ROM, it uses MMC5 to do the high CHR adress selection <a href="http://jonathan.microclub.ch/cat/cat.nes" class="postlink">http://jonathan.microclub.ch/cat/cat.nes</a>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Alright, cool.  Thanks for the tips.  It was the dimensions afterall.  I had them 1x1 too large.  
<br />
<br />About the colors thing... this is something I've never understood when opening ROMs in a tile editor.  Why are they different colors?  I used red, green, blue, and black like you said (#FF0000, #00FF00, # 0000FF, and #0000).  First off I noticed when converting the image to 256, they seem to change the actual color to a variation of the solid colors.  Then the actual colors aren't displayed in the tile editors.  It's weird purple colors and what-not. 
<br />
<br />Sorry about all the questions, I'm so new to this.  I figure if I can get some graphics done for a game I'd like to make, that may motivate me to keep persuing it.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I saw your post after I made mine, Bregalad.  I'll give that a shot in Irfanview.  Thanks.  Also, the example you meant to post doesn't seem to be there.

<br />
<br />Now I understand about the colors.  So the first one listed on there is the transparent color.  So as a general rule of thumb can I just assume that the top-left most color is to be the transparent one?  Something I can keep in mind while making the tiles perhaps?
<br />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, well, actually, they only allow you to use four colors for making sprites and backgrounds, and what you have to remember is that whatever color is first in the pallete is transparent. YY-chr doesn't create the ingame pallete for you, you just tell it this:
<br />
<br />0=color 0
<br />1=color 1
<br />2=color 2
<br />3=color 3
<br />
<br />for example, if you drew a smily face:
<br />
<br />00000000
<br />00100100
<br />00000000
<br />10000001
<br />01000010
<br />00111100
<br />00000000
<br />
<br />in your code, you apply whatever 4 color pallete you want to that tile, and the colors will show up as whatever you assigned as color 0, and 1, since we didn't use color 2 or 3, they wouldn't show up in that tile. Sorry You probably knew that, but oh well. YY-Chr has those multiple palletes so you can click on a color in one of them to quick change to that pallete, and see how everything will look with the desired color, so you don't always have too keep changing them to certain colors to see how they'll look in the actual game. Read me? And get used to start numbering from 0, instead of 1. The NES is capable of making 4 sprite pallets, and 4 background palletes. I'm not really familiar with setting up different palletes for backgrounds, but I know how to do it for sprites. Oh, and make sure that the first color of every pallete (the invisible color) is BLACK! I always make sure it's 3F, and not like 0D, It just seems more reliable. but anyways, I hope you get that.

<br />
<br />$0F is the more 'typical' black and is used by most games.  But $3F is probably fine.
<br />
<br />Staying away from $0D is very good advice.
