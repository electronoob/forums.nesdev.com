As the topic indicates, I've been looking through the Super Mario Bros. source code (and some related posts) to better understand how it works. A few questions:<br /><br />- Sprite 0's tile is the bottom sliver of the status bar coin, which appears to sit <em>behind</em> the coin tile that color cycles. However, when Mario breaks through the upper boundary (e.g. 1-2) and stands in front of the coin, that small sliver appears in <em>front</em> of his leg. What is the priority of sprite 0 and what exactly is showing through? It seems to be the only portion of the status bar that Mario doesn't obscure. I am not clear on tile priorities in this case. Does sprite 0's collision still work if it is behind BG tiles? <br /><br />- When I load the ROM in FCEUX and watch the name tables, the scroll bar never moves. In most other scrolling games, it tracks along the name tables as expected. Is this a FCEUX anomaly or something else I'm missing?<br /><br />- tepples has mentioned previously that SMB uses a 32x13 metatile sliding window in RAM for collision purposes. In certain cases, Mario can kick a Koopa shell offscreen and follow it until it rebounds from a nearby obstacle but without colliding with enemies directly offscreen. Are enemy objects spawned in a tighter perimeter than the collision buffer so that a ricocheting shell can miss them on the way out but collide on the way back (once they are visible)? <br /><br />- I'm not very experienced with debugging tools. How could I experiment with repositioning sprite 0 (e.g. move it further down the screen)?<br /><br />- I understand how the coins/question blocks use palette cycling to 'shimmer' but I can't figure out how the fire flower works. In Nintendulator it looks like the sprites are quickly changing, but I don't see any palette changes.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2462">noattack</a> — Tue May 22, 2012 10:38 am</p><hr />
