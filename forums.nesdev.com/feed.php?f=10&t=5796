So, this what I've done.<br />Same configuration : 8 PRG banks from 0x0010 to 0x2000F.<br /><br />I inserted 128kB at the ROM offset 0x20010 and I copied the last 16kB PRG bank to the ROM offset 0x3C010 (the other bytes are only 00). And finally, I filled with 00 the former last bank.<br />And it worked: FCEUX SP seemed to launch the game!<br /><br />Well, now my ROM file has an increased size (passing from 257kB to 393kB).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3907">Rid</a> — Sat Dec 05, 2009 1:37 am</p><hr />

Maybe the actual carts have more than 1 ROM inside? So when dumped they can add up to sizes that are not powers of 2, much like it happens when you put the PRG and the CHR in the same NES file, the final result isn't always a power of 2, but the individual chips are. If this isn't the case I wonder how the actual carts are.<br /><br />Whatever the case is, we're talking about the NES here, and for it we can safely say that all games use chips whose sizes are powers of 2.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Dec 04, 2009 9:19 pm</p><hr />

People trying to make carts out of these kinds of ROMs will have a lot of trouble (because of the "replicating the last bank" thing). Ideally, the ROM files are exact replicas of the chips, and their sizes are always powers of 2. IMO emulators should refuse to run these broken ROMs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Dec 04, 2009 5:53 pm</p><hr />

You're more likely to "get away with" an odd-sized ROM for CHR than for PRG because CHR has no requirement for vectors to be in a valid bank.<br /><br />If you're making an emulator: It's probably safest to treat "missing" banks in an odd-sized iNES ROM as mirrors of the last bank.
