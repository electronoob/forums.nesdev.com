		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am aware that there are currently three FDS Bios ROMs floating around the Internet, one supposedly authentic, another is Sharp Twin Famicom, and the last is of unknown origin. I have narrowed them down to two. One bios is 8,192 bytes (8kb) and the other is 40,976 bytes (40kb). Both work, so my question is which is the closest to the actual FDS hardware, or is there one even closer than the ones I listed (NOT asking for ROM, just asking if there is a more authentic one out there)? Should the 8kb one be preferred over the 40kb one?

Why would it be 40KB though and not 24KB? Does the BIOS copy its own code to RAM or something?

Myself I couldn't even open my RAM adapter without fearing to do irreversible damage to it... pehaps if I ever gets my hands on a second RAM adapter I could open it and observe it (they are cheap since there is so many broken FDS drives, and this makes the adapter alone completely useless).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The 8 kilobyte FDS BIOS dump is correct. The program ROM resides inside a chip that hosts other hardware too. There are documents that explain all sorts of things about the FDS. <br /><br />I don't know what you mean about what's closest to the actual hardware. The 40kb image, only the last 8K of program rom contains anything useful and that 8K likely is exactly the same as the 8k disksys.rom or whatever you call the 8k file. The Sharp Twin Famicom version is going to be nearly identical to the regular version with minor changes, mainly graphical.

You'll need something to output the data but you could even use the controller ports for that matter. Would be slow but also the simplest, and I assume the earliest attempts were like that.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">MottZilla wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The 40kb image, only the last 8K of program rom contains anything useful and that 8K likely is exactly the same as the 8k disksys.rom or whatever you call the 8k file.</div><br />Beware that 40KB is the maximum size of a mapper 0 program (32KB PRG-ROM + 8KB CHR-ROM). I don't have that file so I can't tell, but if it's just a mapper 0 dump then those last 8KB will actually be CHR-ROM =P

But ofcourse, why do that when both FDS BIOS roms are dumped, the regular and twin famicom versions.

Perhaps other emulators do this as well?  Also, if you try to load the 40976 byte bios as an iNES, it should run in most emulators:  the bios splash screen will be shown, but nothing else will happen, if it's emulated as NROM.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi all, <br /><br />II found this interesting article here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Computer_Disk_System">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Com ... isk_System</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I quote: The device was connected to the Famicom deck by plugging a modified cartridge known as the RAM Adapter into the system's cartridge port, which attached via a supplied cable to the disk drive. The RAM adapter contained 32 kilobytes (KB) of RAM for temporary program storage, 8 KB of RAM for tile and sprite data storage, and an ASIC known as the 2C33. The ASIC acted as a disk controller for the floppy drive, and also included additional sound hardware featuring primitive wavetable synthesis and FM synthesis capabilities. The Disk Cards used were double-sided, with a total capacity of 112 KB per disk. Many games spanned both sides of a disk, requiring the user to switch sides at some point during gameplay. A few games used two full disks (four sides). The Disk System was capable of running on six C-cell batteries or the supplied AC adapter. Batteries would usually last five months with daily game play. The battery option was included due to the likelihood of a standard set of AC plugs already being occupied by a Famicom and a television.<br /><br /><br />It appears that the 40kb dump is really a dump of the modified ROM cartridge itself, and the 8kb dump is just a dump of the bios itself, so the real dump would seem to be th 40kb one, no?
