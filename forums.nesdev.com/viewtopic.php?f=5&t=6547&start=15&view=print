		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is pretty bad ass, I had wanted to do something like this for a long time, but I was going to hand-translate the assembly and special-case the few things that would need it (world 36, for example). Few small issues I noted:
<br />
<br />1) That palette is worse than the Nesticle palette. Reds are too purplish, and black is between dark and medium gray? Blech.
<br />
<br />2) I'm not sure what the cause is, but there are a few points where it seemed the Genesis sprite limit kicked in, but that shouldn't happen since the NES and the Genesis in H32 mode both have the same per-screen sprite limits (64). I especially noticed it at the beginning of both 5-4 and 6-4, with the firebars (in 5-4, the long firebar appeared shorter for part of it's rotation, and the same happened on the firebar in 6-4 right below the powerup block, until I scrolled the previous firebar offscreen).
<br />
<br />3) Cheep-cheeps in 2-3 and 7-3 seem a bit "floaty" - instead of a smooth arc, their vertical speed seems to oscillate.
<br />
<br />4) Also in 2-3 and 7-3, I noticed the occasional bug with regards to a few metatiles having the wrong palette - it's not consistent, however, as across several playthroughs I saw it appear on different blocks, or not at all. I also think I heard mention somewhere of this happening to part or all of a cloud?
<br />
<br />I don't consider world 36 crashing to be a bug per-se - since the behavior in the original game is based on reading out-of-band data, it's not surprising that it would have to be specifically handled on any other version (even the FDS had a different world 36 due to a differing memory layout).
<br />
<br />Every trick I tried that I can reliably pull off worked flawlessly. I can't reliably walljump, so I was unable to test it, but I was able to jump in midair from a powerup, I was able to hatstomp enemies, and I was able to get Little Fiery Mario. Excellent port.

<br />
<br />I see 6502 zeropage as being sort of a 2nd level of registers.  I don't know about anyone else's programs, but I tend to re-use the same zeropage locations for almost everything by just reloading the pointer in it (it'd be pretty insane to have 128 different pointers active at once, at the most).  If there were any 'extra' 68k registers left over, I guess it would help to treat specific zeropage locations as registers.  Just speculation though.

<br />How would your automatic translation program know whether a particular value left in some zero page location will be needed later by some other part of the program?
