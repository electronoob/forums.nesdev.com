Take the recent Street Fighter X Mega Man for example.<br /><br />If you are going to do it anyway, the other way to avoid a C&amp;D is to develop it in private. At least that way you won't get a C&amp;D until it's actually finished, so it has a chance to make its way out to the internet.<br /><br />Or how about you just make your game but not base every single element of the game off of Super Pitfall? If you want to make a similar game it's completely legal to do so under normal circumstances. There is a difference between &quot;inspired by&quot; and &quot;entirely based on&quot;. (Also, if you already made an offer to the copyright holder and were denied, you have an opportunity here to revise your game and release it on your own.)<br /><br />This might not have been an option for Princess Rescue. I dunno how many people would be interested in that game if it weren't a piece-for-piece remake of SMB. Certainly there is a community that would care about a 2600 homebrew platformer like this, but that's far fewer people than would care about SMB ported to 2600.

It's all assembly (albeit a &quot;canned&quot; kernel).  BASIC does not necessarily mean runtime interpreter.

The main map was huge but I don't think a large area gets tracked for off screen activity.  Does quality also explain the &quot;feature&quot; where the player may lose his grip on ladders?  Is it actually a faulty game engine issue?

How close can the game mechanics get before they become antsy?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Specific text, characters, art, and music, and other things of this nature are very copyrightable, If you make a direct copy of any of those things, the case for copyright infringement is very clear. If it's new art but clearly based on someone's old property, it is less clear, but legal cases often argue about whether the borrowed material is &quot;substantial&quot; enough to be copyright infringement.<br /><br />Gameplay itself is usually considered too utilitarian to fall under copyright. (There have been exceptions, but in general it remains true.) It is very normal in game design (professional or otherwise) to borrow gameplay mechanics freely from other games. The thing about this is most games are borrowing from many sources, and the complex interaction of elements makes the combination distinct from other games. On the other hand, if you start lifting every single mechanic from one particular game, copy their implementation exactly, etc. it starts to look a lot more like infringement (and it gets very, very grey here).<br /><br />There are many, many cases where a game is copied very closely, but the art/music is all new, with no legal repercussions for the clonist. I'd go as far as to say that this is rather the norm in the industry. Clones like this have always been quite abundant. There are several notable cases where they have been sued successfully, but I don't think it happens often.<br /><br /><br />What about Spelunky seems at all suspect to you? The whole exploring-caves-in-a-pith-hat motif is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenes_a_faire" class="postlink">scènes à faire</a>, I'd say, so I don't think the art/music deserves much scrutiny (though the golden idol I'm sure is directly based on the one in Raiders of the Lost Ark). The basic mechanics of gameplay are all well established as well, I can't see anything that looks like it's borrowed from somewhere in particular here. The details of the gameplay get rather unique when you start looking at how the particular items/enemies/level-generation all works together in this game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As koitsu pointed out, we're none of us lawyers. I'm not giving legal advice. At the same time, though, I doubt there's much an uninvolved lawyer could tell us about this case that isn't already clear.<br /><br />You should consult a lawyer when you actually have some undertaking planned that you need to understand the legality of. You should also definitely have a lawyer if you're starting a company or making a large financial commitment, etc. but slobu isn't really asking for legal advice in this thread; I think he just wants to know the lay of the land, and I don't think that requires a legal professional.<br /><br />If you want to make a game that does not infringe on copyrights, this is generally very easy to do. You hardly need a lawyer's advice to proceed with that. Even if you've already made a very close clone of something, unless your clone depends on usurping the identity of the thing it's cloning (which Princess Rescue arguably does), it's relatively easy to change enough to make it legal once you realize you can't use it.
