<br />If all I wanted was to watch videos on my PC I'd go to YouTube watch some HD videos, not open an emulator and stare at low-color blocky images.
<br />
<br />What interests me in this project is the potential of it. Maybe as it progresses and becomes more refined it will be feasible for real carts, even if it's for a small intro to a game or something. If that happens, I wouldn't like to be excluded from the group of people who can play that on their consoles.

<br />
<br />Why not just port Chrono Trigger to the PC?
<br />
<br />Because making a few very minor 2-line changes to enable something awesome that is theoretically within the limits of the real hardware is vastly more gratifying and useful than totally making things up.
<br />
<br />A simple FPGA could easily support a 256MB mapper, and perhaps if a demoscene game were popular enough we'd see it one day. Now an entire DVD player? Probably not.
<br />
<br />Anyway, whatever. If you want to cripple the video resolution by a good 60+ scanlines to make tokumaru's TV happy (and PAL TV people unhappy), you can do that too.

<br />Are you suggesting someone implements a realtime video downsampler in their emulator? Seems like an awful lot of trouble for something so pointless. I bet that the coolness of playing your PlayStation games through your SNES emulator will wear off rather quickly.

<br />I'd actually like that. Sonic 3D Blast on the Genesis/MD is 4MB, and it has a very interesting FMV intro. I don't know how much space it uses, but I guess there is a lot of it left for the game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To be quite honest, transcoding is the absolute <em>wrong</em> way to go for making video fit into existing SNES carts. Transcoding is a way to show existing, pre-made video. Eg it would be great for putting the opening FMV from Tales of Phantasia PSX into the SNES game, at a huge cost to file size.
<br />
<br />What you should be doing is hand drawing the video to get it designed for low color, lossless form, and then relying on things like sprites to simulate mouth movements and clouds, and scroll registers for panning.
<br />
<br />Take a look at the opening animation for Wonder Project J for a good example here :)

<br />Hey, this is not about me. I just think that excluding half the people that have the console is not a very "polite" (for the lack of a better word) thing for a developer to do. I know that sometimes it's hard to make both PAL and NTSC crowds happy, but as a game developer I think that's something everyone should aim for.
<br />
<br />If smkd feels that this is just something to use in emulators, well, then so be it, but that would be throwing the potential of an engine like this in the garbage if you ask me.

<br />
<br />Using NTSC would exclude half of the people using real hardware, too :P
<br />But using PAL gives a lot more time to make a higher quality video with lower bandwidth requirements :D

<br />Do your consoles from the 80's and 90's switch just as easily?
<br />
<br />Guys, I hope I'm not comming off as some kind of ass about this... If people decide to make PAL-only (as in "heavily relies on characteristics of the PAL console that can't be simulated on an NTSC one") demos or games because they don't really care about real hardware or don't care about shutting half of their audience off, there is nothing I can do, it's their call. But it is my opinion as a developer that this is not a very nice thing thing to do, that's all.

<br />If a video playback engine provides 256x240 pixels on 50 Hz but 256x192 pixels on 60 Hz, that's fine; the size of the letterbox will be comparable.
