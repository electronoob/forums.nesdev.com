The first time (in the NMI after you have done all writes, if any) you have to write the position of the status bar. That is, write to $2000 with the 2 lower bits holding the index of the name table (00) and then write 0 twice to $2005.<br /><br />Then, after the sprite 0 hit, write to $2000 (if you're using vertical mirroring, if not, don't bother) and to $2005 again, but now with the values referent to the position within the "level/map". The scrollPos variable would be written to $2005. If you're using vertical mirroring, you have 2 screens side by side, and together they are 512 pixels wide. You need 9 bits to represent that, so the 9th bit goes in bit 1 of $2002. If you're using horizontal your screen is 256 pixels wide, so 8 bits is enough.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I only changed the values only in the NMI section at the begining to 0 (which I didnt show in the above code) and nowhere else.</div>

<br />Is this all you need?  In the state above, the sprite moves and when it detects a sprite hit then whole screen "jumps"....

Realistically, this (setting the scroll) wouldn't be the first thing in your NMI. You should set the scroll after all other PPU operations are done, since they mess with the PPU address (wich means they mess with the scrolling).
<br />
<br />Maybe this changes something?

<br />What do you mean? Does it look OK if you don't try to walk? I can't understand exactly what's happening, what kind of effect you're getting... Do the status bar and the lower part of the screen at least appear to be separated from each other?

<br />
<br />At first everything is fine.  When I move left or right and sprite #0 hits a black transparent area it jumps back and forth between the transparent area and the non-transparent area it started from.  It doesn't seem to be splitting the screen.  The entire thing jumps to the left and then back to the right ... left ... right ... etc...

<br />I wondered this myself a while ago. It turns out you can't have more than 1 sprite 0 hit per frame. I don't think you can even move the sprite, but even if you could, the hit flag is raised when the hit happens and it will remain like this until the next frame. The flag only changes it's state once in a frame. That was the answer I got.
<br />
<br />If you want more than one split, you have to use other methods.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, i was trying to use this sort of method to use both pattern tables for BG. I've done it with sprite #0 hits. For the status bar in FFVII NES, I have the status bar graphics in the sprites side of the Pattern Table, then I place sprite #0 in the appropriate place, and I wait for the hit, then I switch pattern tables. I just restore them at the beggining of each NMI, then I wait for the hit and change it. It's actually quite handy, because I get way more space for enemies and such. I haven't actually made the battle engine for it yet, I just made the demo with the status bar.

<br />so that it stays in that one location on the status bar.  When everything first starts up and the player is still ... its directly on top of the non-transparent background.  However, when you press left (and the background scrolls right) the non-transparent background moves out from  under  sprite 0 and thats when the "jumping" I described above starts.

<br />
<br />The sprite 0 hit marks the point where the screen is to be divided. You just have to set a new scrolling value at the proper time, indicated by the hit.

<br />But if you're putting the sprite over non-transparent pixels of the status bar and are reseting the scroll to (0, 0) before every frame starts, the status bar shouldn't be moving and should always stay aligned with the sprite. It makes no sense. If you reset the scroll in every NMI there is no way the status bar will move...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, found the problem and answered your message. When waiting for the sprite hit, you were doing the following:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">BIT $2002<br />BVC $8533<br />BIT $2002<br />BVS $8538</div><br />The flag is set after the hit happens, wich means you were waiting for the hit (branching back while the flag was clear) and then waiting for it to clear again, wich only happened after the whole frame was already rendered, meaning you just ignored the hit. And worse than that: By now, another VBlank has already started, meaning another NMI started before the previous one could end. And that made the writes to the scrolling registers all messy.<br /><br />The solution is just to wait for no hit, and then wait for the hit:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">BIT $2002<br />BVS $8533<br />BIT $2002<br />BVC $8538</div>
<br />This way the NMI's will not overlap since one always ends it's business before the next one starts.
<br />
<br />Good luck!
