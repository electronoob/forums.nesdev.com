<br />How exactly does that work with monitors that are locked at 60Hz?

<br />
<br />The NES signal has 341 dots per line (340 occasionally) and 262 lines. It runs at 60.10 Hz. The true NTSC signal has 341.25 dots per line and 262.5 lines. It runs at 59.94 Hz. NTSC monitors aren't locked to 60 Hz; their analog electronics have quite a bit of slop.
<br />
<br />My recommendation, if your AviSynth must output at 60.00 or 30.00 Hz: Use <a href="http://avisynth.org/mediawiki/AssumeFPS" class="postlink">AssumeFPS</a> with sync_audio turned on. This will decrease the audio frequency by an imperceptible 3 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_%28music%29" class="postlink">cents</a> so that audio and video remain in sync. And I second Dwedit's recommendation of Xvid.

A standard NTSC scanline is exactly 227.50/Fsc or about 63.556 Âµs. These values were chosen such that Fsc/227.50 = 15734 Hz would evenly divide into the 4.5 MHz audio carrier. There are exactly 262.5 lines per field, making each field 59718.75/Fsc long, and there are 59.94006 of them in each frame.
<br />
<br />But most of the old consoles output 262 lines per field, and their line periods tend to be a tad short or long.
<br />
<br />The <strong>Atari 2600</strong> has 228 dots per line, with dot rate equal to Fsc. The <strong>Apple II</strong> has 65 1/7 CPU cycles per line (the CPU is frozen for that last 1/7 cycle), and in 40-column text mode or standard hi-res, there are 7 dots in a CPU cycle, or 65*7+1=456 CPU cycles per line. Each dot is half a period, also resulting in lines of 228/Fsc. TMS9918-family VDPs, such as those of the <strong>ColecoVision, MSX, Sega Master System, and Sega Genesis</strong>, have 342 dots at a rate of 3/2 Fsc, also producing a scanline period of 228/Fsc. All these have a field rate of 39375000/11/228/262 = <strong>59.9228 Hz</strong>, which is pretty close to spec.
<br />
<br />The <strong>NES and Super NES</strong>, on the other hand, output 341 dots per line at the TMS9918 rate. One dot is omitted so that color encoder artifacts line up diagonally instead of vertically. This means the line is 227.333/Fsc long, resulting in a field rate of 39375000/11*3/2/341/262 = <strong>60.0985 Hz</strong>.

<br />it would be really cool to set the monitor refresh rate to 60.098... mmmm...

<br /> I read in some doc, a number of years back, that the last scanline of the SNES display is 1 pixel shorter than the rest.
<br />
<br /> On a side note, byuu had a doc that stated the interlaced mode of the SNES was alternating 262/263 scanlines per frame. Is there any truth to this? I ask, because the PCE can be set to display 262 or 263 scanlines. And if you manually change/toggle this during vblank, you get an interlaced display on SDTV sets (but my HD TV set doesn't like this or show it exactly like my SD sets do).

<br />A proper interlaced display has the vertical sync pulse a half scanline later in the "long" field, so that the sync pulses are 262.5 lines apart.
