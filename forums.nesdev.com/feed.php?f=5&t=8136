Who ever talked about 9-bit ?<br />I've always sad 8-bit was not enough for a screen, and that 16-bits were necessarly anyways to handle overflow and fine scrolling correctly.<br /><br />As you said yourself if you use more than 8 you have to use 16 if you want to avoid extremely complicated operations, now it's up to anyone to use them as they want. I like have the middle 8-bits the pixels, so that the top 8-bits represent metatiles (up to 15 screens) and the low 4-bits the sub-pixel precision. If you use only 2 screens then it won't matter, any object outside $0000-$1FFF will be considered out of range.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Sep 23, 2011 10:05 am</p><hr />

One interesting consequence of upgrading to 2 way scrolling is there are certain configurations of platforms, which could "guide" the player to move a fair distance horizontally (in other words, forced to backtrack), which would be impossible to put in a 1 way scroller because they could get walled off by the leftmost side of the screen.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Fri Sep 23, 2011 6:14 am</p><hr />

Two-way scrolling is possible even with a SMB1/SMB3/SMW style sorted object list, and even without rendering the whole map to WRAM.

Depending on how your levels are stored, it may be harder to code backtracking.<br /><br />I remember in an earlier system of coding levels, my level backgrounds were simply a list of objects stored in order of left to right. When you reach a certain point, a new object comes into range, and then the game decided to start drawing that object from the top-left coordinates specified. Now if that object is 100 pixels wide or something, it creates a problem for trying to move the opposite direction, because the map only stores the object's top left coordinates. When the top-left coordinates come into range, the rest of that object will have already been in range by 100 pixels. So you would have that nice little pop-up effect as a result.<br /><br />Though to counter this, I decided to come up with a less complicated way of storing levels where everything is compressed into 8x2 metatiles. This way I don't have any of those problems, and I now scroll left and right.<br /><br />SMB1 is great, though I will say the scrolling limitation is one thing I remember being frustrating. I think overall most gamers prefer the freedom to scroll both directions, but it doesn't kill your game to only scroll 1 way (as is evident by SMB1's success).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Thu Sep 22, 2011 9:29 pm</p><hr />

I was originally going to have Nomolos be a 1 way scroller. The main reason I was going to do this was to constrain the project, and make it easier to get done. However, to upgrade to 2 way scrolling wasn't that hard, and did not significantly change the overall complexity of the project. The levels are still horizontal, 1 or 2 way scrolling doesn't change that. If I went to 4 way, that can square the amount of time needed to design levels!  <br /><br />Upgrading to 2 way introduced a lot of interesting problems with regard to enemy and item lifetimes, but these were not insurmountable. But I personally think it is wise to start out with as simple a project as you can, to ensure that you get it done and can release it. There's always the future for something more ambitious, and if you have a lot of completed projects under your belt it will give you a lot of confidence. <br /><br />So no, I don't think there's any shame in 1 way scrolling. Any type of movement around in a game creates a unique feeling or atmosphere. I don't consider any of these better than the other with regard to gameplay value. Of course on the technical side, some are more challenging than others. But players don't give a crap about that, they want a fun, challenging game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Thu Sep 22, 2011 10:14 am</p><hr />

I kinda disagree with the whole programming complexity talk. Even 4-way (or 8-way, or whatever) scrolling isn't significantly hard to implement (heh, I have rewritten my engine so many times that I can probably write down a whole scrolling engine on paper in a couple of hours!). I think that many other aspects of game programming are more complex than the scrolling.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Sep 21, 2011 9:52 am</p><hr />

Perhaps SMB1 mechanics were designed much like a shooter game. For 1985, well, the player would play by running Mario &amp; scoring points, no way worried about getting items, but running against the time left. When SMB3 was released, I suppose the same player now had the ability *to explore* a level, rather than just scoring points + running against the time.<br /><br />That's me, of course.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=39">Zepper</a> — Tue Sep 20, 2011 2:40 pm</p><hr />
