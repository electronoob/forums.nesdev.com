I'll be living in Japan for at least another year and a half, and it seems every weekend I come home with an armload of Famicom, Super Famicom, MegaDrive, Game Boy and other assorted cartridges, bootleg systems, accessories and other strange things from the various local Japanese junk shops. While pulling apart a bootleg system or demonstrating a hardware mod like console overclocking is best done verbosely in an article with detailed photos, demonstrating just what GAMES are like, many of which being exclusive to Japan or hard to find in the US/Europe/Elsewhere in something better done in motion, as a running commentary of sorts.
<br />
<br />What I'm considering doing is producing 5-10 minute short reviews, distributed as AVI and/or YouTube videos, demonstrating/reviewing these games, bootleg or official, as well as the operation of bootleg clone systems like the NeoFami/Yobo, Famulator, and Generation NEX, more obscure clones from China, Russia and Korea, and demonstrations of hardware modifications and hacking of classic machines (including but not limited to overclocking.)
<br />
<br />The big question is; would you be interested in watching these? I'd probably produce one a week. Right now I'm sitting on a pile (not literally) of about 45 FC carts, many of them terrific, many of them terrible, many of them caseless PCB pirate disasterpieces .. 2 FC clones (another one, and a MegaDrive clone should be on the way shortly), and quite a bit more. A feature I'd most look forward to doing is a 'Famiclone Shootout' where I compare the Yobo/NeoFami/Famulator/Generation NEX against the real-deal Famicom side-by-side.
<br />
<br />So what do you think? What would you like/not like to see? What sort of a format do you feel is best? Any sort of input is greatly appreciated! Thanks!

To me overclocking seems like a silly macho fad thing that people should be over by now. I think FDS belt fixing/retuning type stuff would actually be more useful to people who can't read Japanese sites. Here are some projects I would be interested in seeing these projects (if I probably couldn't do them myself):
<br />
<br />-Upgrade FC/NES memory to 8K for dev purposes (just connect most significant A lines)
<br />-Create a hardware debugger/stepper for NES using a save-state mechanism (OK so this one isn't so easy, especially not with discrete logic :)
<br />-Create open HID compliant USB game pad with a microcontroller for people to use with newer more accurate emulators
<br />-RGB -&gt; component transcoder using opamps for MD/PCE/SFC/NG etc
<br />-USB adapted Dreamcast coders cable
<br />-Create a 74 series digital counter and RGB LED based JP/EN &amp; 50/60Hz import mod for MD/SAT using reset or something so they don't have to add ugly toggle switches. Maybe the same for SFC w/ 50/60Hz and CIC.
<br />-Tap digital audio from consoles
<br />-Multi-console power supply
<br />
<br />
<br />Also If I had to do a overclocking mod, I would do a VCO in a PLL with the original oscillator so it's reliable and so people could tune instead of switching between different crystals which seems inelegant.
<br />
<br />I also think most people here would sooner just illegally load up a ROM of a game instead of spending bandwidth seeing it reviewed (or maybe that's just me)
<br />
<br />If you know of any undiscovered, rare and/or expensive SAT/PSX/PS2 games, I would watch those be reviewed though.

<br />Actually, my current implementation uses a variable oscillator card with 3 crystals and an adjustable multiplier. Rather nice for on-the-fly clock adjustment. However I am currently working on rigging up a proper square wave generator with adjustable frequency to the FC2 and MD1 with a BNC cable and termination for the maximum possible stability. For the MD and FC, using a multiple of the bus clock isn't necessary to achieve very high speeds-- and any stability issues are not caused by lack of sync with the bus, but from timing issues. In either case these are extremely uncommon to cause real showstopping problems.

<br />I would assume some people here would add RAM to the NES if it was required for the debugger. I think most people here would want a real hardware debugger and build one if plans were out there.
<br />
<br />I think some people here would build a NES pad to use with DirectInput emulators also developed by people here. I think many general ROM kiddies would like to play with real controllers too.
<br />
<br />I think just about every A/Vphile retrogamer would want component video and digital sound from their old consoles.
<br />
<br />I think import gamers who have concerns about devaluing their consoles by case-modding would like the digital switch idea.

There is the potential for it to miss NMI signals but I have not encountered any games that experience serious problems resulting from this. The better games seem to be the ones with the more 'correct' timing algorithms, not just running as fast as is physically possible on the 6502 at ~1.79 MHz. I intend to test many more to see what crops up, and I'm positive I'll see some interesting issues, but likely on an oppressed minority of games. I've only seen any sort of graphical corruption past 3.5 MHz, twice the original speed of the NES/FC's CPU, and beyond the reasonable limit of 'practical' overclocking. ~2.3 MHz is enough to remove most lag entirely.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">kyuusaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Some of those suggestions of mine wouldn't be feasible in video form or are they "retro" clearly but I think all of those projects would have great appeal, at least a lot more than overclocking or Famiclones from 2003 onwards.

However more recent ones, even NOAC/FOAC based models have much higher build quality and are generally more professional due to the new legality of FC clones making them less 'underground', and OK to sell in conventional brick and mortar stores in the US, for example. This hasn't been the case in the past so you'd mainly just find weird cheap FC clones by the truckload in places with less/none Nintendo-imposed restriction such as China, Korea, Russia, etc.<br /><br />I still find older clones more interesting. That's why I have planned reviews of very old FC clones from the early 90s and late 80s, many of which use discrete ICs rather than one common 'FOAC/NOAC' ASIC.<br /><br />While your project ideas might be very appealing to people of this forum with an intimate grasp of electronics and NES programming/emulation, as well as for other systems, I have my doubts about their widespread appeal and therefore the value of the time investment. I'm sure you see where I'm coming from, there.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">kyuusaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I would assume some people here would add RAM to the NES if it was required for the debugger.

The people who really have use for a debugger are probably qualified to design and build one themselves-- will your average retro gaming enthusiast hop on google or youtube to look for a step by step guide to building a device that either will lend 0 functionality to their raw gaming experience, or a device they're unaware of the function of?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">kyuusaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I think some people here would build a NES pad to use with DirectInput emulators also developed by people here.

There are quite a few docs out there about wiring up classic controllers to a PC. Honestly I'm more interested in what can be done with physical hardware rather than emulation, or at least what is atypical and has novelty. Emulation doesn't surprise anyone, or make anyone scratch their head and go, 'Huh.'<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">kyuusaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I think just about every A/Vphile retrogamer would want component video and digital sound from their old consoles.</div><br />While you can get away with that on some systems (the MD comes to mind) you're not going to swing it on the NES/FC, since the video is composited inside the PPU. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> I like the look of RF/composite personally; it blends the pixels together in a way that can best be described as 'poor man's antialiasing'. A lot of developers, some of whom I've spoken with personally, used the 'imperfections' of NTSC video to turn creative dithering into the simulation of hundreds if not thousands more colors than the system can actually generate. Also, using digital audio output on some systems would degrade some of the natural enhancing qualities of analog audio. The sort of thing your local vinyl enthusiast would complain about perhaps. But to me, the less my systems look and sound like an emulator the better. I didn't grow up with perfect RGB where you can count the pixels that compose Mario's moustache, on a 1080i LCD TV with SPDIF audio connections to a 5.1 surround system. Fucks with the experience to do it now. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I think import gamers who have concerns about devaluing their consoles by case-modding would like the digital switch idea.</div>
<br />Probably. But in theory they're already 'devaluing' them by modding them at all. The systems I get are rarely in such pristine condition and have at least a little cosmetic damage, e.g. the natural yellowing of FC/FC2/SNES systems, so I consider it an improvement to add functionality even if you're putting a switch or some LEDs on the unit, if it's done in an elegant fashion.

You'll see I'm a member of that forum and working on optimizing a Quake port with simonjhall for use on the DS.

<br />Maybe; I'm not into vinyl myself so I can't comment. But I was just using it as an example that the pickier in the crowd are going to be the ones who find imperfection with digital audio reproduction of a normally analog audio path.
