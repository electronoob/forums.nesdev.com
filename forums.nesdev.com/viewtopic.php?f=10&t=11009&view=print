I'm now thinking maybe I have bitten off more than I can chew in these early days, and should have perhaps stuck with the previous approach, at least until I have a basic one screen game under my belt...<br /><br />I've attached the code (asm6 syntax), what I'm trying to do is output a single line row of nametable tiles (no attributes) and a single metasprite (16x8).  Nothing seems to happen...  I had similar code working using the all-in-NMI approach.  I think my implementation of the buffering technique mentioned in the wiki article is just broken.  I set the data for the buffer as a test, normally I guess this would be generated on the fly.<br /><br />The format for the buffer is stolen from the wiki: number of bytes, high target address, low target address, bytes to write, terminates if length = $00.<br /><br />Thanks for any help, and if you think I'm overstretching myself, just let me know <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm a newbie myself but yeah maybe you shouldn't bother too much with buffers and stuff that early. Just get Pong working first then try adding buffers.<br /><br />But that's one of the things I don't like about the Nerdy Nights guide (although it's an excellent guide for other reasons), he puts all the logic in the NMI. I had a simple delay routine made out of nested loops which delays for about half a second that's supposed to happen everytime you score in Pong. But half a second is too long for the NMI, so the delay never happened. When I moved it to the main loop (that's called &quot;Forever&quot; in the Nerdy Nights) everything worked. I didn't bother with buffers though.<br /><br />If you are doing the logic-in-main approach, just make sure you have all the graphic updating code in the NMI and the controller reading (and other logic if any) in the main loop.<br /><br />And whenever you change something, make sure you change as few things as possible between testing. If you change too much it's impossible to know what change it is that breaks your program.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle">Pokun wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I had a simple delay routine made out of nested loops which delays for about half a second</div><br />That's not how delays should be implemented, regardless of whether this loop is inside the NMI handler or not.<br /><br />The thing is you shouldn't stop everything to concentrate on a single task. A game is a collection of smaller systems that run in parallel, like the game engine, the music engine, and so on. If you have one of these subsystems hog the CPU with a task that's supposed span several frames, all other subsystems will stop, and that will cause important things like timers, music or raster effects to completely stop working during this time.<br /><br />Games must do everything step by step. Every frame, each subsystem gets a chance to update itself, and they should only advance the equivalent of one frame before releasing the CPU for the other subsystems that also need updating every frame. A subsystem can choose not to update itself, but it should never interfere with the other ones.<br /><br />The correct way to implement delays is to use counters, and perform certain tasks (the ones you want to delay) only when the counter is 0. For example:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">IF COUNTER IS 0:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;UPDATE GAME OBJECTS;<br />ELSE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;DECREMENT COUNTER;<br />END IF</div><br />This will pause only the updating of game objects, until the counter reaches 0. So, if you want to pause the objects for 2 seconds, just set the counter to 120. But everything else that needs to run will keep running, you won't be pausing your whole program just so that objects won't move.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But half a second is too long for the NMI, so the delay never happened. When I moved it to the main loop (that's called &quot;Forever&quot; in the Nerdy Nights) everything worked.</div><br />That's probably because new NMIs were interrupting the wait loop of the previous NMI, and the game logic was running anyway. Moving the wait loop to the main loop might have given you the result you wanted, but like I said above it's a very bad way to implement several-frame delays.

The problem in this code is the fact that it uses CLI at all, despite not wanting IRQs.

I guess it forces you to do more reading though, this forum seems targeted to more advanced topics, and people who actually know what they're doing <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><br />Anyway, I've scrapped the buffering idea for now while I concentrate on actually finishing something.  I've separated all of the game logic and only handle drawing/PPU updates in the NMI routine now.  I'm aiming for a very simple Space Invaders clone.  The code is attached if anyone feels like commenting.  I don't like how everything's in one source file at the moment, and I need to work on some way of controlling game states.<br /><br />Thanks.
