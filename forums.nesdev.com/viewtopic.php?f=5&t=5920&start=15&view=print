		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry, guys for being a little late on the response.
<br />
<br />I just wanted to say thanks a whole bunch guys for all the suggestions! A lot of the ones mentioned are ones that I have played before, and I agree with them being suggested. Some, however, I have yet to try. And funny enough, I forgot about the Megaman series! It just slipped my mind, but I'll definitely be putting them all on.
<br />
<br />I was surprised to see that nobody mentioned Kirby's Dreamland. That is probably one of the best NES games in my opinion. Was that maybe included in the "don't mention the obvious ones" category? I don't know. Anyways, I suppose I could just put pretty much every NES game on my PowerPak, and try them all myself. But I was just curious to know which ones would be recommended. I also don't know if I saw Dragon Warrior/Quest 1-4 mentioned. Is 4 compatible with the PowerPak? For some reason it rings a bell as being special somehow. Is that the one that's really huge?
<br />
<br />Anyways, thanks again guys! I'll be giving these games a try <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Kirby's Adventure is great but really easy and short. I like it but definitely not one of my all time favs.
<br />
<br />Dragon Quest games are all compatible with the Power Pak, but for some reason I have trouble enjoying to play them on the NES. I enjoy the SNES/Playstation/GBC version a lot better. What I don't like is probably the SLOW walking hero, the SLOW battle and the INCREDIBLY HUGE amount of time you have to spend to level up if you want to survive even the first trial.
<br />I think it went better for DQ4 tough, I finished Chapter 1 and it was pretty good but I was stuck in Chapter 2 in a cave I'd be killed in a matter of seconds and didn't want to spend one weekend leveling up.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry about the mixup! I meant Kirby's Adventure. I really enjoyed playing it because it didn't feel as limited as most NES games do, and I LOVED the fact that you could -save- your progress. Though I think a password option is really great for when something happens to your saved game. Besides that, I liked that it was easier. Lots of NES games are annoyingly difficult. However, I agree that I wanted more out of it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />. Graphics were really lovely too.
<br />
<br />I actually had the courage to play through a hard copy of Dragon Warrior 1 on the actual NES! Yeah, it was a good thing to experience; I think most hardcore RPG lovers should definitely play through it just to see where we came from and how far we've come. It was somehow oddly enjoyable. The whole game was pretty much leveling up so you could buy the new equipment to level up some more, etc. But I still enjoyed playing the game somehow, despite the fact that it wasn't very good. I have not yet played Dragon Warrior 2, 3, or 4. I will load those onto the PowerPak as well. I have the Gameboy Color version of 1&amp;2, but I want the NES experience for now.
