In analyzing that ROM, man, there's so many empty banks before you get that small assortment of data later near the 32Mb region. It's like... Why not just have made it 8/16 Mbit instead all the fluff -.-<br /><br />Anyway, here's the video I made. I enjoyed this hack so much. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTstPjZPo9g">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTstPjZPo9g</a><!-- m -->

Or is it NES transliterated into Cyrillic characters? The OSD looks like NovaYoshi's Curtis TV.
