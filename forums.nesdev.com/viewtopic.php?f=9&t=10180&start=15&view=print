It only requires two CPLD's if you want the whole darn thing.  Board configs like TNROM can actually be fit within a SINGLE 72Mcell CPLD.  That's basically the same size CPLD that retrozone had used for their MMC1 reproboards.  The logic savings comes from only 8KB of CHR-RAM vice 256KB of ROM.  That provides a huge logic savings and it's still the same fully capable, fully emulatable MMC3 mapper.  The logic is only simplified to account for the memories it must support.  To go even further logic can be saved when the board is designed for a single game because games don't generally change the banking mode, they set it at init and forget it.  Hardwiring the logic that is never even used reduces the logic needed significantly.  For example I can fit ANY MMC1 <strong>game</strong> into a single 36Mcell CPLD, but I can't fit EVERY MMC1 game into a single 36Mcell CPLD <strong>at the same time</strong> (the CPLD would have to be configured for the specific game's needs)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">qbradq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">That's a real bummer that the MMC1 repro board is no longer available from RetroZone.

Soon you won't have to worry about memories either (or soldering for that matter) unless you choose to, and I'll have them posted for online checkout vice special request as is the current case.

I believe I had to remove both PRG and CHR banking mode bits.  Your suggestion/trick to use a 6bit shift register was a little challenging to implement properly, but with some trickery I was able to get it to work and it freed up enough logic to make this possible. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Would removing the shift register and making it parallel/direct access still let it fit in the same size CPLD?</div><br /><br />Yeah everyone gets fixated on the serial writes.  Moving to a parallel write is basically like trading I/O for logic, and with current small CPLDs logic is at a premium, and there are plenty of I/O to spare so it's a no brainer if you're willing to create a new mapper.  Effectively CPLD's only come as small as 32-36Mcells.  I can fit dang near everything of a traditional MMC1 in a 36Mcell CPLD with serial writes.  Going to parallel writes would easily allow for the entire MMC1.  I'd argue that 8KB/32KB CHR/PRG banking modes are worthless though and should be stripped from a homebrew 'MMC1P' since you're already requiring a new mapper to be created.  And since you're already looking at a completely new mapper you may as well optimize and utilize every last logic cell in the CPLD it's designed for (presumably Xilinx XC9536XL).  CHR-ROM doesn't make much sense nowadays, so moving to 8-32KB of CHR-RAM would free up quite a bit of extra logic.  Logic that could then be used for a simple CPU cycle counter or possibly even more...  I'm brewing something up along these line right now, but I'll save those details for a separate discussion. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The serial shift access to registers is one of the pain points of the mapper. As stated previously this makes things more difficult when you want to do fancy banking. MMC3 is a bit better for this because it's register is accessed in parallel, but you still have the same issues if banking inside and outside of interrupts due to needing to write the bank selection code to the $8000 register first. But even with UxROM which does not have this problem, you still have to take steps for housekeeping (making sure the proper bank is restored prior to rti'ing).<br /><br />Now if you want to talk about what you <em>can</em> do with the pins of an MMC1, the possibilities are pretty limitless <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Am I the only one that gets excited every time Infiniteneslives posts?<br /><br />So here'd be my wish-list for a low profile homebrew mapper (I.E., not the do-everything bee's knees I tried to put together years ago)<br /><br />1. 8k PRG banking at $8000 and $A000, up to 512k<br />2. 8k PRG RAM at $6000 with write-enable<br />3. 8k CHR RAM bankable to 32k<br />4. A CPU cycle counter or PPU line counter interrupt of any sort<br />5. Run-time selectable H or V mirroring<br /><br />I think that would cover a lot of homebrew use cases. The obvious things this would not cover is DPCM sample banking, fine CHR banking for certain effects (like those parallax-looking things some games do) and very large RAM applications like a language interpreter or C runtime.<br /><br />Also, if PRG and CHR banks can be selected with a single write to a single register like with UxROM that would save a lot on housekeeping load on the CPU, and allow some of the cool features like far pointers.<br /><br />Priority of extra features if you have the resources left over would be:<br /><br />1. Bankable RAM up to 64k<br />2. Fine CHR RAM banking, two 4k chunks or four 2k chunks<br />3. Bankable $C000 and $E000 PRG ROM pages<br /><br />Things that are not needed in the mapper:<br /><br />1. Multiple-fire IRQs, easy to do in software by resetting a single-fire iRQ<br />2. Fine RAM banking, no practical application (although a few impractical ones spring to mind)<br />3. CHR ROM+RAM support, no practical application not covered by having bankable RAM<br />4. More PRG ROM, no practical application yet seen (excepting pirate games like FF VII)<br />5. Custom sound hardware, those folks don't typically use one-size-fits-all hardware<br />6. Four screen mirroring, lacks compatibility with current systems<br />7. One screen mirroring, limited application<br /><br />Lastly, a spot for a serial Flash memory hooked up to the expansion pins would be a great touch to a board. It'd be a nice option for saving data in a less corruptible way, and those things are dirt cheap these days.

IMO it makes little sense to use CHR-ROM with banks that large (8 or 4 KB), because those sizes are not suitable for pattern animations (nobody would want to animate all 256 background tiles, or replicate over half of them to animate the remaining ones), so if you don't need the quick switch you might as well go with CHR-RAM and not be restricted by such huge pattern blocks.

(The mapper is intended for use with 8K or 32K CHR RAM.) And yes, it fits in a 36 pin CPLD.

Saves you ONE instruction, wow.  If you enjoy 8KB CHR and 32KB PRG then discrete mappers are the obvious choice, you have little to gain from a MMC1 aside from WRAM.
