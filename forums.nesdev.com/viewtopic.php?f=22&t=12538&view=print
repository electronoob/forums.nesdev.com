		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In this thread I'll be sharing progress and asking help if there is something I can't figure out.<br />Right now I have few questions:<br />1. What would be the best way to do a fade in/out with a single routine?<br />2. What would be a good way to make main loop recognize the game's state (title, paused, main game, cutscene etc.)? Should I put a short code at the beginning of the main loop that checks a variable for game state and then jumps to that part of the main loop?<br />3. How do I make indirect jump with NESASM3? Most places seem to use <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">JMP &#40;<em>address</em>&#41;</tt>, but it doesn't seem to work. NESASM seems to convert it to a absolute jump.

Fading out means substracting $10 from all entries, and using $0f whenever an entry becomes negative. Fading in is more complicated and there is several approaches you could use (personally I don't fade the palette in <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> )<br /><br />2. Normally the PC (program counter) holds the game's state. Only if you are going in a &quot;everything in NMI&quot; type of code architecture will you have to do something like what you described, whenever you want to do that is up to you.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Mmh, a good idea would be to keep a &quot;darkness&quot; level, where 0 = normal, 1 = a little dark, 2 = medium dark, 3 = completely dark, 4 = black.<br /><br />Then, you substract (darkness &lt;&lt; 4) from each palette and use $0f whenever the result is negative as you update the palette,<em> without writing the result back in the palette buffer</em>. That would allow both fade in, out, and darkness changes anytime during gameplay. The main problem is that it would not allow to have lightness greater than normal, but that is not what you asked for.<br /><br />For the program counter it's completely transparent. You just have different parts of your game coded as different routines (or different parts of the main routine), and the PC keeps tracks of this, because that's how the 6502 works. It couldn't get simpler really.

What would be the best way to do a fade in/out with a single routine?</div><br />I like to keep a copy of the unmodified palette in RAM, and have a routine generate a darkened copy of it based on a global brightness level. Pretty much what Bregalad said, except I'm not a big fan of the 4-step fade because it looks very jerky unless you animate it really fast, which kinda defeats the purpose of having a fading routine, which is to make transitions smoother. I prefer to simulate more brightness levels in some way, like darkening the colors one frame, moving them towards blue the other frame, or darkening colors of different brightness at different times ($0x colors become black, then $1x colors become $0x, and so on, until they're all black). You can use whatever darkening method you like in the fading function.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">2. What would be a good way to make main loop recognize the game's state (title, paused, main game, cutscene etc.)? Should I put a short code at the beginning of the main loop that checks a variable for game state and then jumps to that part of the main loop?</div><br />I vote for different loops for different states. In fact, all the different states in my programs have an entry point, where any necessary initialization takes place, followed by the loop itself. This way I can switch to another game mode simply by JMPing to its entry point.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">InitializeTitleScreen:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;initialize variables, draw the name table, etc.<br />UpdateTitleScreen:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;read controllers, move the cursor, etc.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jmp UpdateTitleScreen<br /><br />InitializeGameplay:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;initialize variables, decode a level, set up the pattern tables, etc.<br />UpdateGameplay:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;read the controllers, process game objects, etc.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jmp UpdateGameplay</div><br />Depending on how complex your pause screen is, it might not deserve its own state, but if it's a complicated menu or something, you might want to make it a sub-state, since it will interrupt the gameplay and resume it later. The main difference is that its initialization can't be destructive, it has to use RAM that's not in use by the parent state and it has to be aware that modifications to the screen and other things used by the gameplay have to be undone before returning.<br /><br />In my projects I even allow custom NMI routines for the different states. My NMI checks the high byte of a pointer in RAM, and if that byte isn't 0, it jumps to that address. If the byte is 0, it just sets a flag indicating that VBlank has started, so that simpler game states can use the good old &quot;wait for VBlank&quot; structure.

Why would you want multiple main loops ?</div><br />I also have no idea what the sleep variable is, but multiple main loops help keep the program organized and the different parts independent from each other. Personally I'd prefer that over spaghetti code with multiple game states mixed together any day. If separate game states happen to share a lot of code, you can consider merging them or turning the shared code into subroutines.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh, the method tokumaru posted looks quite organized and powerful. Personally I just don't work with &quot;states&quot; at all. To pause the game, well I just read the controller until start is pressed again and then return. Same for the title screen, I have a loop and when start is pressed, it continues down into the main program. It is just logical for me. However, it might not be as organized.<br /><br />I think what I describe above could be considered multiple game loops. However, all of them are implicit, they are just natural, because I don't leave a routine (or part of a routine) until some event happen that makes me leave it with the rts instruction.

A pause screen that does nothing but wait for the game to be unpaused certainly doesn't deserve its own state. The same goes for a title screen that only waits for start. But once you have states that allow navigation and so on, I think it becomes important to separate things, otherwise the code might become hell to maintain.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I think what I describe above could be considered multiple game loops.
