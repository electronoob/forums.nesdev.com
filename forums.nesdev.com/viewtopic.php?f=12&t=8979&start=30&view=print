I just checked, Mouser has the NJM2268 DIP in stock.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" /> <br /><br />Well at any rate, I too ordered a couple NJM amps, as well as a few THS7314 amps and a slew of caps. I just wish I would have known that the NJM's had a newer version, I had to buy some SOIC-DIP adapters so I can breadboard with them. The only thing, those NJM's aren't exactly SOIC. They're a package that the manufacture calls &quot;DMP.&quot; A little Googling told me that they have the same leg spacing as SOIC, but the package is a little wider. So they probably wont fit on regular SOIC adapter boards. I paid a premium for some <a href="http://www.schmartboard.com/" class="postlink">Schmart Boards</a> because their &quot;EZ&quot; adapter boards have much longer pads to make soldering surface mounted stuff a little easier. I'm hoping the longer pads will allow me to use this DMP package. If not, I'll have to hand wire them to pin headers so I can breadboard with them. <br /><br /><br />Long story short, the only two things I'm not 100% on is:<br /><br />1): AC or DC coupled output ? <br /><br />2): Best way to kill the voltage on the Pr and Pb lines without effecting the image quality?

Use a highpass filter with corner frequency &lt; 1.6kHz (1/10th of horizontal line frequency). Assuming the TV has a 75Ω input impedance, this would be ⅟(2·π·75Ω·1.6kHz)=1.3µF. So a 1µF decoupling capacitor would be pretty close, and a little larger would be a little better.<br /><br />Adding a DC offset (for DC coupling) will require a different schematic, and will probably require a different kind of opamp, but a &quot;difference amplifier&quot; would be how I would do that.

Two things though: One, when I took Pr and Pb from the input pins (after the RC circuit) I also had a 1k resistor to ground at the input of the amp. So if you recreate that RC circuit, you will have to tack on a 1k resistor to ground at the end of it. IIRC, the voltage is slightly higher on one of the lines, so you might not need that 1k resistor on both lines. And two, if you're using a slightly newer version of the amp from the N64 mod on GameSX, than you might wanna read through the datasheet for it just to make sure anything vital didn't change (like capacitor or resistor values, adding or omitting parts). <br /><br />The only other thing, I've noticed that I get different voltages depending on whether the console is plugged into a TV or not. So you'll want to consider that when testing.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">IMO, these are same question.</div><br /><br />Sorry, let me clarify what I meant with #2. I meant what is he best way to kill the voltage <em>before</em> the amp. Right now, the two schematics I've posted above are the only things I have to try.<br /><br />So, AC coupled output is the way to go? That's what I suspected. Thanks!

Thanks!</div><br />Seems it would be best to mimic the way the SNES handles it from the factory and pass the pins 1 and 24 through the RC filter, decoupling cap (1 uF) and then into the amplifier. The SNES takes the same approach as the Pb and Pr are matrixed in the S-ENC and then amplified 6 dB in the S-ENC after they pass back into pins 10 and 11.

I was looking at the schematic for the N64 RGB mod with the NJM2267 and noticed something comparing it to the datasheet. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.gamesx.com/wiki/doku.php?id=av:n64rgb-amp" class="postlink">N64 RGB mod from GameSX</a>:<br /><img src="http://www.gamesx.com/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?cache=&amp;media=av:n64rgb.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />From NJM2267 datasheet:<br /><img src="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g295/Ziggy587/NJM2267_zpsab68bdff.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Take a look at the outputs. See how in the data sheet it shows &quot;Vout1&quot; then &quot;Vout1 (6dB)&quot;? Now if you look at the outputs in the schematic from the GameSX mod, there's just a series 75Ohm resistor (and no resistor to ground). So I'm just wondering what the deal is. The person that created the N64 schematic, why didn't he use the 75Ohm resistor to ground as shown in the datasheet? And also, if we WANT the 6dB gain, then what do we do? Omit the two 75Ohm resistors?<br /><br />AaronE, I realize you said you're using the newer NJM2268, but I believe the datasheet for it shows the same thing. <br /><br />My parts came in. I have the NJM2267 and the THS7314, and a whole mess of capacitors and resistors. I'll post my results as soon as I get the chance to mess with it all.

So at least trying it with and without the 75ohm resistor will be as easy as popping the resistor on and off.
