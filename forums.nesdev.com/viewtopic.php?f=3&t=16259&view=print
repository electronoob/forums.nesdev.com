Only FCEUX with its Old PPU emulation seems to be able to run the game past the title screen, all other emulators that I have tried fail, including FCEUX with its New PPU emulation. The game has been reported to work well on actual hardware.

		<br />
	</div><br /><br />I'm noticing that with New PPU on, the Y position is detected a little bit lower than with Old PPU. Even in Old PPU mode the position is a bit low, but with New PPU the X detection pass is just too low for it to register.<br /><br />I haven't looked into how FCEUX registers a zapper hit, but this seems to be the problem. Operation Wolf has a very similar detection scheme, but it appears to work because its Y detection isn't so low, so the difference doesn't cause a problem.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, playing a little bit around with Mesen's debugger...<br /><br />I think it's an interaction of two &quot;sorta&quot; bugs, one in the game, and one in how most emulators implement the Zapper.<br />#1 The game draws the horizontal scans a couple scanlines <em>below</em> where the mouse is pointing. On hardware, the bit goes true a few scanlines after light is sensed, and so the game should scan for X position a few scanlines higher than it does.<br />#2 Many emulators only check the single pixel under the mouse cursor, instead of the comparatively large area that the Zapper actually sees.<br /><br />So the two together mean that the game gets a Y coordinate in the first frame, and no X coordinate at all in the following six.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As far as I can tell, changing Mesen's code to check for any single &quot;bright&quot; pixel in a 3x3 or 5x5 grid around the mouse's position seems to fix the game (the targeting is kind of bad, but that might be the game's fault). Doing this makes most of the vertical/horizontal pattern tests in Zap Ruder behave more or less like a solid white block, though. I'd be curious to see how those patterns behave on an actual CRT+Zapper...

I (or someone else) can probably figure out some way to make one?

And does it just pick up the light from those bars no matter where you aim inside the pattern? If so, the vertical tracking in both tests would work despite aiming at the black portions of the pattern.<br /><br />In that case, it would make sense to expand the tracking in Mesen to a ~5x5 grid, since that's pretty much how the tests behave with a 5x5 grid.<br />In contrast, at the moment (in emulators), as soon as you put the mouse into the black areas, the tracking arrows reset to their default position at the bottom of the screen (and I doubt the zapper itself is precise enough to do this unless you stick it to the screen of a 30&quot; CRT..)
