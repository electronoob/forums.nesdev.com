If you write the whole PPU palette at once, the only thing that matters for setting the background is the write to $3F10.<br />Other writes don't matter as far as what is displayed for the background.

The code that I pasted is my own code. I'm not that familiar with increments of the vram. I have (borrowed) the vram engine from Legend of Zelda, where i can load up nametable updates, quick palette updates, all while PPU Rendering is on, and i get the correct results. The issue I'm having, is definitely the reading of $2007. Someone suggested i should have my palette values, to be stored in ram while it's being written to vram, so i can simply alter the ram contents, and have the engine load the ram address, and store the new updated palettes to $3F00-$3F1F.<br /><br />So i may just have to redo my asm, to incorporate the ram storage of any palette updates. It's just tedious, cause i have certain palette updates going on, that are small in nature, and will have to come up with different setups, to have those portions stored into the correct areas in ram. I figured i could just bypass all of that with a simple read of $3F00-$3F1F.<br /><br />For a poor mans cheat way of doing it, i have ppu rendering turned off, i then read the palettes, store to ram, then turn ppu rendering back on. Obviously i get the millisecond black screen, but that quick flash I'm able to live with, compared to the alteration of my vertical scroll position.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5898">infidelity</a> — Sun Mar 01, 2015 1:12 pm</p><hr />

Why don't you keep a copy of the current palette in RAM at all times? That would probably simplify things.<br /><br />That being said, I don't see any serious bug with this specific piece of code, so the problem must be the timing, or some other configuration. We'd need to see more code... but judging from the lack of labels and variable names I guess you're the guy who codes in hex, right? A ROM would also help us debug this.<br /><br />I must say that incrementing the VRAM address manually is an odd choice, considering the PPU automatically increments it after each access (by 1 or 32, it's your choice). You only need to set up the address once at the start ($3F00), and then read all the bytes in a loop. You can end the loop when X reaches #$20, there's no need to keep track of the address.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Feb 28, 2015 8:46 pm</p><hr />

the purpose of my code, is to have the current palette set from $3F00-$3F1F, backed up to ram, so that I can alter it later on, by INC'ing each value gradually to 30 (white).

Two things:<br /><br />1. I would guess the sta $2006/sta $2006/lda $2007 is what's causing your problem (particularly the lda).  I'm not even sure what you're trying to accomplish there (I understand the code, just not the purpose).  It looks like you're trying to back up parts of the palette *while* changing parts of the palette.  I think because of the load, you may end up tweaking some of the internal PPU addressing bits, causing glitching on-screen.  You may need to set $2005 to zero twice, and/or touch $2000, either in the middle of this routine or at the very end (see #2).  The details are here (be prepared for pain): <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/The_skinny_on_NES_scrolling">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/The_ ... _scrolling</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I'd suggest just keeping all of the palette contents somewhere yourself (e.g. in ROM) and just writing them out to the PPU as needed.  Only update the palette entries you need to (i.e. don't update all of them unless you truly require such).<br /><br />2. You didn't disclose where/when this routine is being called.  If it's being done in NMI/during VBlank, then possibly your routine combined with other code in NMI/during VBlank is taking too long (extending outside of VBlank), thus causing problems.  You might need to set $2005 to zero twice, and/or touch $2000 as well, before the end of the routine (so that when VBlank ends and the raster gun begins reading from PPU memory, it starts reading from the correct address).<br /><br />Just thoughts that came to mind.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Sat Feb 28, 2015 3:23 pm</p><hr />

I'm trying to load up all of $3F00-$3F1F, and have those 20 bytes of my palettes stored into ram. I'm able to do it, but, I get a very quick vram glitch. Idk if its cause I'm loading 20 bytes, or if I'm not doing this in the proper way? Ill show the asm I have going on.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; what I do, is set X as 00, and create the address '3F00' to store at ram $50-$51<br />LDX #$00<br />LDA #$3F<br />STA $50<br />LDA #$00<br />STA $51<br />LDA #$20<br />STA $52<br /><br />;I then load $50-$51 for palette address loading, and alter the ram address $51, so I can load through all of $3F00-$3F1Fppu, and store it through ram address $53-$72<br />LDA $50<br />STA $2006<br />LDA $51<br />STA $2006<br />LDA $2007<br />STA $53,x<br />INX<br />LDA $51<br />CMP #$20<br />BEQ (to LDA #$FF, after my next description)<br />INC $51<br />BNE (to LDA $50, up above)<br /><br />;the INC $E1, is for my asm address pointer table, to make it so when the cpu finishes it's cycle, it will no longer read the asm I just pasted here, I have it looking at just an RTS for now.<br />LDA #$FF<br />STA $73<br />INC $E1<br />RTS</div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5898">infidelity</a> — Sat Feb 28, 2015 12:09 pm</p><hr />
