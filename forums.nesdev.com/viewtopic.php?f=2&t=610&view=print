		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've got an idea: with the NES's many quirks, why not make a list of things that one has to do to make a game run on a real NES? This will answer the questions of the many n00bs here.
<br />
<br />I'll start with what I know:
<br />
<br /><ul>- Wait two V-blanks on startup before doing anything with the gfx.<br /><br />- Read $2002 before writing to $2005/$2006.<br />- Write two zeros during vblank to $2006 (if that doesn't work, write $20 then a zero to $2006).<br /><br />- Use Sprite DMA instead of $2003/$2004 whenever possible.<br />- Write a zero to $2003 before doing a Sprite DMA.<br />- Do all the sprite DMA during vblank.</ul>

<br />Why DMAs ? Do you want to do more than one sprite DMA ???
<br />Of course it is also possible to do it midframe if the screen is off, but it is pretty much complicated and useless for many genres of games.

Right at the end of your NMI routine, write zeroes to $2006 twice ($0000 PPU address, right?), and then write whatever value you desire (or just zeroes as well) to $2005 to set up your scrolling. Also make sure that you have $2000 and $2001 set up correctly. This should make the background nice and stable. If it is still unstable, try writing $20, then $00 to $2006 (making the PPU address $2000) instead. Strangely enough, I've found that that works when #$0000 doesn't. Ahh, the joys of NES programming...</div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually, the proper thing to do is not to write $00 $00 to $2006, but to write your 'origin' nametable to $2000 (lower 2 bits) and your horizontal and vertical scroll to $2005. This sets the same bits as a double-write to $2006 (more, actually) and specifies scrolling parameters as well.

<br />However, write to $2000 every frame is needed as well, as Q descibed.
