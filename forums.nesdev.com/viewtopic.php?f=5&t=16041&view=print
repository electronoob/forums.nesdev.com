If one OR both are pressed it will look the same to the system.<br /><br />I did a tiny bit of soldering when I was a kid, with kits that tell you exactly what component to put where. And I melted the plastic and the company sent me a replacement. So electronics is not a skill.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> <br /><br />Where would I start?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

Connect the switches of the 2nd controller to the 1st in Parallel, not series (that would mean both switches need to be pressed (AND))<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://cdn.instructables.com/FWD/RHYG/HN386RMM/FWDRHYGHN386RMM.MEDIUM.jpg">https://cdn.instructables.com/FWD/RHYG/ ... MEDIUM.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />If you aren't used to soldering, i recommend you buy a bundle of through-hole resistors (cheap) and start practicing soldering them to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripboard" class="postlink">stripboard</a> (also cheap). That will boost your confidence and make your hand sure. <br /><br />Your soldering station normally comes with care and use instructions. My thumb of rule is the minimal amount of time to get the solder point properly wet. Keeping the tip of the iron slightly wet at all times helps. I remove excess solder and possibly slag from the tip on a moist sponge between soldering joints. Just feed a little more solder as you hold the tip to the hole. You want the ring of the hole to be a bit warmed up before you apply solder, so that it bonds. This takes just a fraction of a second, though.<br /><br />Here's a few illustrative pictures if you got it right or wrong:<br /><img src="https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/001/978/medium800/tools_Header_Joints.jpg?1396777967" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://cdn.instructables.com/F2H/400P/F41RXKV0/F2H400PF41RXKV0.MEDIUM.gif" alt="Image" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As for tools, you need:<br />Soldering station (duh) - pick up one that lets you set the temperature. <br />Solder with lead (more durable over time, easier to solder, but an environmental issue. shouldn't be used on things that go to recycling anytime soon, and isn't allowed in commercial products within the EU at least)<br />good ventilation<br />good, ambient light to properly see what you're doing. <br />a mat made of something that can take solder fleas and burn marks. <br /><br />You might also want:<br />wire stripper. <br />tweezers and pliers.<br />a copper wicker to desolder mistakes. I've found that the option (vacuum pumps) hardly work. Maybe i've tested a crap brand. But wickers are sure to fix it. <br /><br />You'll probably need:<br />Extra wire. <br /><br />Before soldering wires to pins or points, strip about a centimeter or so of isolation. You can fold any excess of stripped wire. Roll the copper fibre between your fingers. Coat it with a thin layer of solder.<br /><br />If a joint looks wrong, don't panic. Just put your tip there and resolder it. If the amount was wrong, apply more solder or draw excess solder away with a wicker. <br /><br />It's good practice to be quick about soldering joints. If you're in contact for too long, you might damage the PCB and its traces. Chips may be sensitive to excessive heat, too. Discrete components like resistors can take a beating without failing, which is why they're good practice material.

Wanted to share the final result here as GradualGames requested I make this for him.<br /><br />I used a LS series AND gate which I deadbug soldered inside a little enclosure I stole from a cheapo USB hub.  Added some stickers to cover up the 'TOMTOP' branding.<br /><br />He requested one of these years ago from me for NES and I never got around to it.  So I had the idea to make this work for both NES and SNES since SNES controllers are fully playable on a NES console.  Has the added benefit of doubling as a SNES mouse to NES adapter at the same time!
