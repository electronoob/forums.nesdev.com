<br />
<br />Because BRK pushes PC pointing to the 2nd byte of the instruction following the BRK.
<br />
<br />And RTI pulls the PC without changing it.
<br />
<br />So if RTI is used to return from a BRK call, then the immediately following byte after the BRK instruction would be ignored.
<br />
<br />I guess I'm either wrong about what address is pushed by BRK or about RTI returning grom BRK, but which one?

<br />Yes, which is why the Apple IIGS monitor disassembles BRK as if it took an 8-bit argument: "BRK $00" through "BRK $FF". You might think that would be useful for a syscall mechanism, but <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=816" class="postlink">the performance isn't there</a>.

<br />
<br />It's classified as a signature byte.  This is mentioned in some 65C02 and 65816 books -- for example, Programming the 65816 Including the 6502, 65C02, and 65802 by David Eyes and Ron Lichty.  I can provide an exact quote from their book if you want.
<br />
<br />I don't understand why so many people have trouble understanding BRK and what the operand byte is for; it's probably because so much 6502 documentation states it's a 1-byte instruction and never points the reader to the fact that the PC is incremented by 2 when encountering BRK.  It amuses me when I see disassemblers doing things like turning bytes $00 $C7 into "BRK" then "???", rather than "BRK $C7".

<br />
<br />Maybe it's because $00 is the single opcode that causes the 6502 to completely ignore a prefectly good byte of executable code, which doesn't seem logical, and the fact that, at least the documentation I read, says nothing about this, only a "pc + 2" without any explanation in an uncommented pseudocode.

<br />
<br />Then the documentation you've been reading is sub-par (authors didn't bother to take the time to write something that covered such), same with the source code you've been reading (lack of comments for unintuitive things == trouble).
<br />
<br />BRK's behaviour, and signature byte (specifically PC+2), is covered in most 65xxx books I own.  It's not your fault if what you've read isn't decent quality.

<br />
<br />I've finished coding addressing modes and instruction exectuing (big switch for each) but there surely are some errors, I didn't test it yet.

<br />Technically, BRK doesn't skip anything. When the CPU executes the BRK opcode, it pushes the address of the opcode+2 on the stack, then pushes the current flags ORed with $30 on the stack, then jumps to the address contained in $FFFE-$FFFF. It's up to the IRQ/BRK handler what to do next, and how to return to the interrupted code.
<br />
<br />For good documentation, get a book. I've been reading the 6502/65816 book koitsu just mentioned and it's the best by far of all those I've evaluated recently (I just love that the library still has these!).

<br />.... because the 6502 pushes return adress + 2 on the stack. There is really no other reason. I guess the byte can be used as an "argument" to the BRK opcode, to tell the IRQ handler which type of IRQ you're simluating.
<br />The BRK opcode is completely useless IMO and I never ever used it. I don't see the point to call the IRQ routine in the middle of code.

<br />I understand that PC+2 is pushed onto the stack, which <em>causes</em> the skipped byte, but I'm wondering if there was some kind of reasoning behind pushing PC+2 onto the stack, as opposed to PC+1.
<br />
<br />Maybe I got confused, but it sounded like there was a use for (or otherwise, a reason to have) the argument that nobody was explaining. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
