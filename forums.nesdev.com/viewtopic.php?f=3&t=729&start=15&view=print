If you run a piece of code within "invalid" opcodes, you still watch their behaviour and can describe them. For general emulation, or even homebrew development, it might be useless. Next, if you really want a test ROM for opcodes, it might not exist as you wish. Your task is to understand the instruction/opcode itself, rather than its amount of cycles. What's the secret of "read a byte (+1 cycle), setting flags" and such? If something seems incomplete or inaccurate, so go ahead and update the wiki with something useful to us. ^_^;;

<br />You know, it'd be much easier if he had something concrete to test rather than having to come up with a test by himself.

For instance, a 6502 manufactured by MOS Technology may differ from a 6502 manufactured by Ricoh. (Ricoh made the NES chipset.) Anything involving the $EE may be affected because the $EE seems to come from the decimal-mode circuitry, which is omitted from the 2A03. In addition, a few of the "unstable" opcodes such as $9E have been found to differ based on the high bits of the program counter, which in turn differs whether you try it on a C=64, an Apple II, an Atari 800, or an NES, because they all load code into different parts of address space.
<br />
<br />For now, just halt on the "highly unstable" or "disputed" opcodes so that a developer who is smoketesting a build on your emulator can tell when the program has jumped off into nowheresville.

In my NES emulator I only handle the documented ones (and a few of the other NOP and 2-byte NOP codes) and have encountered very few common-mapper cartridges that execute them, and it could be that even these are due to bugs in my emulator rather than intentional use of them. I imagine Nintendo would not have accepted games which used them since it might limit their options in future NES hardware revisions and emulators.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some time ago I traced the code for the SMB/Tetris/Nintendo World Cup multicart to verify its unique mapper behavior, and in so doing I noticed a couple of two-byte NOPs (most likely a patch in an effort to produce the multicart).  Thus, Nintendo used an undocumented opcode at least once.
<br />
<br />It's my understanding that the more bizarre opcodes behave differently depending on whether the instruction was interrupted by DMA.  Testing such behavior would be tricky (as you would need to use the DPCM to do it), but that is one thing I've always wondered about.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Translation: the Game Genie effectively modifies the PRG data, so even though most games themselves don't use unofficial opcodes (beyond a few multibyte NOPs), the application of Game Genie codes might result in use of them. Personally I doubt many Game Genie codes use unofficial opcodes; I'd guess that the most common codes change the branch condition, replace an instruction with NOP (perhaps one of the multibyte versions), or change the operand of an immediate instruction.
<br />
<br />On the topic of the multi-byte NOPs, they can be very useful for implementing multiple entry points to a routine, so I can understand why they'd be allowed by Nintendo. Perhaps their behavior is very well-defined as compared to the other unofficial opcodes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, it sounds like multi-byte NOPs should probably be implemented even if you aren't going to do the full undocumented opcode set. They are far more likely to be used, and are included in at least one licensed game if the above info is correct. Besides, they're very easy to add.

<br />
<br />I remember Q talking about this in #nesdev awhile back.  seems there was a single bit error in the ROM data which turned a load or store instruction into an invalid opcode.  So, I don't think it was on purpose.  
<br />
<br />The more interesting question would be how the single bit error occured between development and final ROM.
