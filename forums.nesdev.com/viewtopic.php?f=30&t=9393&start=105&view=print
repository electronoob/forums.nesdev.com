There are lots of other contributors who put in even more time than I, and they aren't getting reimbursed either.  It's a labor of love. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  if I had more free time (or fewer active projects) I'd do more than the 50 for free, but it's not to reasonable for me personally.  I've got help I can enlist going forward if everyone desires, but they need to be compensated.  The good thing is there's not much limit on what they can produce though, so if there was desire for the carts to be released long term it's an option.  It'd be nice to see something like that cover hosting expenses.<br /><br />Another big motivator to get people to submit legit entries would be to give the contributors free carts.  Or maybe something like the top 10-20 submissions by popular vote.  I'd probably volunteer my time to assemble those carts myself, but well discuss that when the time comes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well this is kind of embarrasing, but the screws are still the last item needed still.  I had informed retrozone about the missing screws last month and I thought they had sent new screws.  But after they didn't arrive I realized they had simply re-forwarded me my original tracking slip saying the screws were in a pink bag (which I never saw).  They said we were on our own to get screws...  I checked the local hardware stores this past week and it seems that #2 wood screws fit the bill.  But I could only get a couple dozen locally and they were flat head vice phillips.  I checked McMaster Carr but the extra price didn't see worth it, so I'm now resorting to ebay.<br /><br />I'm thinking two packs of these should work: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=221230141468">http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?Vi ... 1230141468</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I sent an message to the seller to confirm the size of the head since it looks a little big.  Pending that answer or anyone else's suggestions on here I plan to order these by Monday.  Good news is that seller is in the states so if all goes as planned I can seal up these 50 carts I've got sitting here by next weekend.

I'm planning to post them up this weekend for the pre-release for contributors.  Thinking we can open them for general release around the beginning of July.  I'll get some pictures for you guys shortly and a more official release info after confirming a few things.

At that point any contributor who hasn't purchased a copy (or specifically contacted me via PM/email) will loose their reserved copy which will become available for purchase by the general public.

Tepples, if you can .zip up everything we want/need bundled up for GPL and all that, I can host it and/or link to your site for download so we're legit.  Also, is there a NA thread about all this? or just the <a href="http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&amp;threadid=63581" class="postlink">action53</a> thead?  We should ensure a thread gets up over there to ensure everyone is informed.  If someone wants to take the lead on that, feel free to copy my entire post here.<br /><br />And FINALLY, the goods:  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><img src="http://www.infiniteneslives.com/img/images/StreemerzSm.jpg" alt="Image" />
