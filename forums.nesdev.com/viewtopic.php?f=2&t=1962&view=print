		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you want to connect a PC to a cartridge, something like an EPROM emulator would the way to go.  I've seen one for about $90, which is a bit more expensive than using an EPROM programmer and a couple AT29C256s.  A ROM emulator lets you change the program and re-upload a lot faster though (will have to have 2 emus or use CHR-RAM though if you want gfx).
<br />
<br />Also there's my Squeedo board, I could sell or loan one for $100 (refundable if a loan, minus paypal fee and/or shipping cost).  Squeedo uses an RS232 port, turn the NES off then on to reset, and upload the program with XMODEM through any terminal prog.
<br />
<br />CopyNES with a RAM or Flashcart would work well too.  Pricing for the assembled version of my UNROM Flashcart for CopyNES starts at $19 (for no case or CIC).  Works fine with an external chip burner too, if you don't want to desolder an NES cart or get a CopyNES.  Bare PCB = $5.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok. I would like the cheapest method. I am a real noob when it comes to this. I don't want to spend $90, but $5 is fine by me. If you could point me in the direction of somewhere to buy then that would be fantastic. I do have some questions though. How would I connect my PC up to the PCB? Do I need any special hardware to burn the EEPROM?

<br />Of course you do. The (E)EPROM programmer. The easiest way to run software on the NES is not by directly connecting your PC to a cart, but by programming a chip with the programmer, at the PC side, and then placing that chip on the board.
<br />
<br />Depending on how often you want to change the thing you are testing, an EPROM emulator, as Memblers said, might be a good choice. The bad part is that they're expensive (more than the programmer), and you'll need two: one for PRG and for CHR, if not using CHR-RAM. If your "rewrite rate" is something more modest, you should go with the EPROM programmer. I use mine with Flash ROMs, not EPROMs. Flash ROMs don't need to be erased, you can just rewrite them (as opposed to EPROMs, that need 20+ minutes of direct UV light to erase), and the writing only takes a few seconds, so rewriting them is pretty quick. It seems that they can be rewritten about 10000 times, wich means that even if you rewrite them several times a day they're likely to last a few years.
<br />
<br />I decided to get the programmer instead of the emulator(s), mainly because it's cheaper and it's more versatile (can program many different types of chips, even permanently if you wish - the emulator will always be temporary).

<br />
<br />I wouldn't mind spending $19 either. The idea of me not opening anything up sounds good too lol. Having just checked up on a NES flashcart, I would say that it is exactly what I am looking for. Could you elaborate on this a little more please. Do you have pictures of your UNROM Flashcart?
