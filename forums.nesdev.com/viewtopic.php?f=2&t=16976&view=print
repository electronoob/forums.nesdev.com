		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been making improvements to GGSound and was certain what I was seeing must have been a regression, only the way in which I make it happen can't possibly have anything to do with my NES code. Here's what I noticed:<br /><br />-I play a song that is nothing but a drum loop on the noise channel and observe the perceived volume coming from my speakers, playing this song using ggsound from Nestopia.<br /><br />-I click on the title bar of Nestopia in Windows and drag it, doesn't matter how far, and let go.<br /><br />-Suddenly the audio is noticeably louder. I did not notice this occur on any other channels, and yet when I isolate just the noise channel using Nestopia's volume settings, I can't seem to reproduce the issue any longer.<br /><br />I can't imagine simply dragging the emulator (which presumably would pause emulation) and observing different behavior could have anything to do with my NES code...<br /><br />just wondered if anybody has noticed this with Nestopia or not. It's kinda subtle, and for all I know I'm hallucinating from coding too much this evening  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />*edit* I can also reproduce the sudden increase in volume by restarting the song, which would point back to my NES code. I'm wondering if there's some subtle setting in the APU I am neglecting which could affect the volume. I am not familiar with or understand the &quot;sweep unit&quot; that couldn't affect this, could it...?<br /><br />*edit* Yet, I can't seem to make this happen in any other emulator.

I can make the problem happen when no DPCM samples are playing, however, though they would have played previously (one of the first tracks that plays as you advance towards this drum loop track would have played some DPCM samples).<br /><br />Is there a way to control this behavior?

All channels explicitly set their volume on every frame (I store their current channel state and upload it once per frame to the apu registers). Plus, this problem can happen just from dragging the window. I don't see how dragging the window would trigger NES quirk emulation behavior...

You can restart the song by continuing to hit up. It sometimes suddenly gets loud just doing this. You can also try dragging the window and it'll get loud in that case too.<br /><br />I know it's not a regression now because the demo linked there has none of the changes I've been working on this evening.<br /><br />I forget which registers do what; just that all of their volume settings are uploaded once per frame.
