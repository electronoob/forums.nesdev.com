		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks! <br /><br />The test (when used on a powerpak on a PAL console) says only the first 128kB of PRG-ROM is available, so that's likely problem considering the rom file is 512kB:s which might mean this powerpak disclaimer:<br /><em>&quot;PAL compatibility has not been fully tested, only that it will run games.</em>&quot; means something unfortunate in this case.<br /><br />So, in effect the first 4 banks are mirrored, which explains why the intro &quot;returns&quot; to the title screen instead of level 1. Bank switching isn't broken - the banks are; when using powerpak on pal.

I'll try to find the link to that when I'm at my real computer instead of my phone....

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i'll try using thefoxs' map22.map tomorrow or something, that should do the trick (my old cf reader/writer has extremely finnicky contacts and the usb terminal contacts are too small for me to see clearly, let alone resolder, so i need to get a new one and i've just had enough trying to hold it in a very specific angle  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /> ). <br /><br />We're indeed targeting gtrom, but since toggle switch has an everdrive and i have a powerpak, we opted for bnrom during development which would work for both. <br /><br /><br /><br />@toggle switch: <br />&quot;jitter&quot; may have been the wrong word, but for me, in fceux, every sprite movement is staggering as if every other or so update didn't happen, at least here. It behaves on nintendulator, so the game is most probably ok too, i just want to make sure on hardware. Both have differing oddities i'd credit to PAL emulation inaccuracies most likely, but better be sure.

If you can figure out where the problem is, you can probably make that part more resilient and compatible across different environments.<br /><br />If you're doing something really precise and/or revolutionary that hasn't been thoroughly tested and documented before, then yeah, there's no way you'll get it to work everywhere, but if you're not doing anything &quot;groundbreaking&quot; at the technical level, programs *should* work on the most common emulators.

It may turn out to be 100% the emulator's fault, sure, but as long as there's a chance that your game is doing something unsafe/unreliable, I think this is worth looking into.<br /><br />I don't know if this is good advice, but I'm the kind of developer that absolutely hates when bugs magically go away, because I can never be sure whether they were really eliminated or just obscured by some &quot;fortunate&quot; coincidence. When my programs aren't behaving correctly, I absolutely need to find and understand the reason, so I can fix it properly and be sure that other less obvious parts of the program aren't being affected by the problem too.

The avi plays decidedly smoother than when playing. So it seems that for some reason, FCEUX in PAL mode has a display problem (maybe frame rate related?) on <em>this </em>particular pc. I expect the avi to be wysiwyg compared to my pal console in terms of smoothness. <br />As a side, the extended vblank of PAL happens to do this game subtle favours in some places. Boss fights and the busier rooms are rock solid. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />Which bank is title screen and intro graphics data (including palettes loaded from)?
