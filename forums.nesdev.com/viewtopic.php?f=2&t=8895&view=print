The link appears to be dead now.
<br />
<br />I haven't tried syntax highlighting with assembly before, I don't know why it didn't occur to me to set it up sooner.  I was wondering if either of you still have it, I'd rather not reinvent the wheel if I don't have to. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />The old link was dead. I clicked the "www" in banshaku's post and saw he had a new site. I assumed everything might have been migrated, and pasted the end of the dead url to the end of the new site.

IIRC, his knows a ton of keywords for different assemblers. Also, I seem to remember we disagreed on some colors...! But since he's much more of a professional software developer than I am, his choices probably make more sense! =)

<br />
<br />It was more a personal preference more than anything else =) I prefer light colors theme since they will be less hard on your eyes if you work all day in front of your monitor. But depending of your monitor (which was your issue if I remember well) or the lighting around your desk, it may not work well.  So it must be adjusted accordingly.
<br />
<br />Another reason of the color I chose is because of the way I write the code with comments, which make it easy to read.  Since the instruction set is quite limited and the highlighted text are usually small word, the way of writing will affect if the color makes sense or not.
<br />
<br />I don't remember if I updated it since I didn't code nes for a long time.  I think I didn't.  If I did, I will update it once I can find some time.  It support at the least ca65 and (maybe) some other assembler like nesasm and asm6. It's been a while so I don't remember well.
