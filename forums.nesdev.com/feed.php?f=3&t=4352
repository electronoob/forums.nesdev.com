My intention is not to be rude toward you but I would suggest you that before that you tackle your emulator project, you should do a little bit of practice regarding bit manipulation and how to take advantage of your developing environment  (in your case, delphi 2007). <br /><br />This first step will make your life a lot more easier.  If you don't, you have to fight with the information that you don't know yet (in that case, the nes) and the tool that you are not sure how to use properly. <br /><br />A first experiment that you could do is and that is related to your nes emulator is to try to show on the screen character data (I will now call it chr data to make it shorter).  The chr data is encoded in interleaved bit plane so you will have to manipulate every bits to be able to show the picture on the screen.  If your read nestech, you should have all the information regarding the format.  If you don't understand the format, people will be more than happy to help you in the appropriate forum. It may already have been explained in the beginner forum.<br /><br />You can take the chr data given with the chr editor called yy-chr, this will give you a reference on what to expect to be shown on the screen.<br /><br />From this data, you will have to:<br /><br />- Learn how to manipulate bits<br />- Learn how to read binary data<br />- Learn how to show that data on the screen with an indexed palette, if possible<br />- Learn on how to show bit mapped data on the screen in your dev environment<br /><br />All those building block that you may find not that fun to do at the beginning will be quite useful later.  And the routines that you will do can be reused in your emulator. So I guess this little practice will be quite valuable later.<br /><br />I hope I was not too harsh on you and you have the right to do anything you want but I think that little exercise will help you a lot.  Knowing your tool is quite important, you should not ignore that part.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Tue Sep 02, 2008 8:08 am</p><hr />

If the result is 1, the bit is set, if it's 0, the bit is clear. Although "1bitBufferFor6" is a pretty weird name for a variable!<br /><br />The basis of the binary system is that each bit position, when set, represents a value:<br /><br />bit 0: 1<br />bit 1: 2<br />bit 2: 4<br />bit 3: 8<br />bit 4: 16<br />bit 5: 32<br />bit 6: 64<br />bit 7: 128<br /><br />These are the values you use to read each of them. Note that it's possible to combine these bits to form any number between 0 and 255, so this is how the binary system works.<br /><br />Just to make sure you understand: Say that the byte you have is 01001101 in binary (77 in decimal). To read the status of bit 0 you use the mask 00000001 (1 in decimal). The AND operator performs the AND operation on each pair of bits (the bits that occupy the same positions in the 2 numbers). AND only outputs 1 when both inputs are 1, meaning that if the result was not 0, it's because the bit that was in the same position as the one in the mask is set.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I use Chr() after BlockReading first 5 bytes using a for loop to get Nes&gt;8 (&gt; is some funny character I don't know the ALT code for), and IntToStr to get after getting the byte/bit for the next 3 values.<br /></div><br />Sounds messy! You are reading a binary file, you shouldn't rely on ASCII characters or strings, because the information that's there is just not text. And you shouldn't be reading integers, but bytes.<br /><br />If want to do this right, don't just write what works, spend some more time getting it to work as it should. you shouldn't bother about the representation of the 4th byte, it wasn't meant to be read as a string. If I'm not mistaken, it's supposed to have the value $1A (hex), and that's all you should care about.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Would these values be correct for this particular game? (So I know I am on the correct track).<br /></div><br />I don't know. Load the game in Nestopia and select View -&gt; Image Info and compare the info to what you've got.<br /><br />So, I just tried the following code in Delphi 7 and had no problems reading the header as an array of bytes:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">var gameFile: file;<br />var header: array&#91;0..15&#93; of byte;</div><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">  AssignFile&#40;gameFile, 'makai.nes'&#41;;<br />  Reset&#40;gameFile, 1&#41;;<br />  BlockRead&#40;gameFile, header, 16&#41;;<br />  CloseFile&#40;gameFile&#41;;</div><br />Then to detect the state of bit 0 of byte 5 you'd just do (header[5] and 1), if the result is 0, the bit is clear, otherwise it's set.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Sep 02, 2008 6:45 am</p><hr />

I will first suggest you to learn delphi's bitwise operator.  This will be important for programming anything that do operation on bits.<br /><br />Here's a chart that I found that will help you:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Bitwise Operators:<br />Operator    Delphi  C#   Visual Basic .NET<br />And         and     &amp;    And<br />Not         not     ~    Not<br />Or          or      |    Or<br />Xor         xor     ^    Xor<br />Shift-left  shl     &lt;&lt;   None<br />Shift-right shr     &gt;&gt;   None<br /></div><br /><br />If you want to read a bit, you will want to isolate it with an "and" operation. After that, it depends what you want to do with it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Tue Sep 02, 2008 1:15 am</p><hr />

Delphi 2007 is technically identical, although the memory manager and some IDe specific features have changed are can be considerably useful, better debugging, full Vista and backwards compatible support etc.<br /><br />Yes I can get a single byte, the issue is a single Bit value (the bits of the byte).<br /><br />I have recently learned I need to use an AND operator in some fashion to gain a specific bit value from a byte, I am not 100% on exactly how to go about it, but I am starting to understand it better.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3647">Chesso</a> — Mon Sep 01, 2008 11:56 pm</p><hr />

This is extremely important if you hope to have any understanding of the NES.<br /><br />Anyway, in Delphi (or any other language for that matter), bits can be manipulated with bitwise operators like AND, OR, and XOR. When you got a value, in order to know if a particular bit is set or clear you have to AND the value with a bitmask, and if the result is not 0 then the bit is set. AND can be used to read and clear bits, while OR can be used to set bits. XOR is mostly used for inverting bits.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Sep 01, 2008 6:41 pm</p><hr />

I know pointers, least of my worries lol.<br /><br />Unfortunately Delphi and Binary files are, and although earlier I felt quite stupid (seen as other Delphi programmers have not been able to give a straight answer either, I don't as much anymore), but basically I attempt to read byte 6 from the NES rom, yay great, now to convert that to it's individual bits......<br /><br />Then again i'm coming down with the flu and it's early morning here, it's probably something simple that will pop into my head as the day goes by.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3647">Chesso</a> — Mon Sep 01, 2008 3:08 pm</p><hr />

Good "test roms" would be Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr, Mario Bros (not Super), 1942, Pac-man, Joust. <br /><br />If you aren't familiar with Pointers you need to learn them. Without the use of Pointers it will be harder to emulate memory mappers and mirroring things. <br /><br />About the 6502, there is a text file 6502.txt that lists every single opcode, detailing what each one does. With that alone you should be able to build a decent CPU core as the document contains pretty much everything you need to know.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Mon Sep 01, 2008 1:14 pm</p><hr />

Ok I have obtained some more information to go through when I have a bit more time, and hopefully I can at least start on reading the file format and getting my head around the 6502 CPU.<br /><br />If anyone knows where I might find some basic/test NES roms that would be very helpful if I get things kick started (following the iNES format, but only containing basic CPU stuff, and any others that aren't to complex).<br /><br />I really have probably too many documents at the moment..... but the more the merrier <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3647">Chesso</a> — Sun Aug 31, 2008 10:15 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Chesso wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />this 6502 replica has op codes (operation codes, short codes pretty much meaning internal functions?), registers (some sort of memory storage I assume) etc.<br /></div><br />Not only the 6502, but every CPU in the world! The 6502 has a very limited number of operations it can perform, each one has a code and a well defined behavior. The memory that's internal to the CPU exists in the form of registers. Some are accessible by programs, others are just for internal use.<br /><br />One very important register is the PC (program counter). It's a 16-bit value that points to the current instruction being executed, meaning it's used to fetch instructions sequentially from main memory.<br /><br />Simple 6502 emulation is pretty straightforward. The value at the reset vector (please read about the 6502 vectors somewhere) is the initial value of the PC. Once the PC is set, there can be a loop to:<br /><br />1. read a instruction from the address pointed by the PC and increment the PC;<br /><br />2. depending on the instruction, you might have to read more parameters (multi-byte instruction), and increment the PC accordingly;<br /><br />3. execute the instruction, simulating the behavior described in the docs;<br /><br />4. go back to step 1;<br /><br />Instructions can manipulate flags, registers, memory values, etc, so you must program each one of them very carefully. If they don't behave exactly like the originals, the games will much likely to crash.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />And also how to read the NES files and understand them, I assume they must be read in binary mode or some such.<br /></div><br />Yes, you should handle everything in binary, because the opcodes are byte-sized and you must be able to read single bytes.<br /><br />NES files are usually composed by a 16-byte header, followed by the contents of the program chip (this is what you'll run through the 6502 emulator), and then the contents of the CHR chip (these are the tiles used to compose the screens).<br /><br />However, keep in mind that the NES can only see 32KB of PRG-ROM and 8KB of CHR-ROM without any mappers. The games that respect those limitations are known as NROM games, or mapper 0 games, so you should start with one of those. If a game uses a mapper other than 0, you must be able to emulate the mapper before emulating the game, and now is really not the time for this.<br /><br />Now, if you don't know that stuff, you got some reading to do. Go read about the iNES header (the first thing you'll have to interpret), the NES memory map (so that you know where to put the contents of the NES file). Once the PRG-ROM is in place you can start emulating the CPU. Reading the basics of computer architecture could help you a lot, since you seem to not have a clue about how a computer works at the lowest level.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Aug 31, 2008 5:50 pm</p><hr />
