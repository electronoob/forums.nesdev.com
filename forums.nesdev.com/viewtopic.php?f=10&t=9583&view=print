		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello All,<br /><br />For awhile I've been wanting to get a better understand on how software communicates with hardware and how the hardware works. Along with these ventures I've stumbled across a few questions. Currently I'm looking into buying IC's for NES cart building. The site I think I'm going to buy from is: BuyICNow.com (unless someone knows of a cheaper site?), so what I'm doing is searching for '27C020 &quot;, form which I understand is the chip I need. What comes up is what i presume is a whole bunch of brands. Being a fresh college grad I don't have the cash for anything premium, would 'TI TMS27C020-15JL' work for nes carts? Also I'm currently following this turoail for learning purposes: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.annahegedus.com/videogames/99-make-custom-nes-carts">http://www.annahegedus.com/videogames/9 ... -nes-carts</a><!-- m --> In the tutorial the user is soldering wires from the ic legs to other points. Now I have A.D.D (could have mist something in the video) so please bare with me, is she doing it because the tecmo basketball game is mapped differently? If I use an original Super Tecmo Bowl Cart to make a 2013 one, or one with the same board would I have to do that? <br /><br />Thanks for any help <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />BTW! do these: &quot;32 PINS DIP Socket (RoHS)&quot; also work with nes carts? <br /><br />-Jake

Honestly my day job is c# coding for an insurance company, I have a computer information systems major which translates to 0 knowledge on hardware, I'm a fresh college grad and I just want to continue learning in my field. <br /><br />besides that, thanks for the answer!<br /><br />I've read a bit online about the degrading of these ICs, is there a way to prevent that? How long do these last? Also is there something I can read up that explains how to determine what the wires should be coming and going to? Is it pretty much the same for every game or do they differ? My last question is if I use these: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=24&amp;products_id=42">http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.ph ... ucts_id=42</a><!-- m --> do I have to worry about doing it?<br /><br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />-Jake

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For games smaller than 64k/64k you usually don't need to do any rewiring.<br /><br />We heartily encourage you to use ReproPaks whenever possible; most of us frown on the destruction of original games. However, the ReproPaks are only suitable for a large subset of all games (what are called mappers 0, 2, 3, 7, 34, and 66 with some rework), and he's sold out of MMC1 ReproPaks.<br /><br />As far as purchasing, Mouser usually has better prices for small numbers of parts; also using EEPROM or Flash is usually less frustrating than UV EPROMs. <br /><br />EPROM bit rot is a very slow process, and if you DTRT (one of those foil perfectly opaque stickers), you should easily get tens of years of life. I'm not clear on the relative security against bit rot for all of these technologies; certainly anecdota of thirty-year-old no-loss 'PROMs abound.

But various factors will have an effect on the life span of the chip. And if the chip has &quot;bit rot&quot; you can always reprogram the chip later if you didn't damage it somehow.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There's also OTP EPROMs, which are usually a little cheaper than regular EPROMs when new, and they don't even have the window to let potential UV light in. They're not erasable, but this is fine if you're making something permanent with them. I dunno if they last longer than regular EPROMs, but it seems like there's less chance of accidental erasure at least.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually the way EPROMs work (or fail) isn't about UV light erasing data over time. Each bit is a cell that is charged by specific UV wave lengths that an eraser produces. The charge or amount in a cell has to be a certain level for this bit to be considered a 1. If it drops below a certain level then it's a 0. So bit rot would be over time that charge has diminished and a bit that was once set, is no longer set. OTP EPROMs are charged before they are packaged. Once they've been packaged, that's it. You have no way to recharge them because you'd need to do quite alot to open the package back up to recharge the cells. <br /><br />I could be wrong but I recall reading this about EPROMs. So it's not that the window letting in light somehow lets bits rot or be erased. Again I've heard that it's actually difficult to erase an EPROM without a UV light, even the sun itself isn't a reliable eraser. So it's more about how well the EPROM was constructed and erased and programmed than worrying about covering UV windows or whatever else. Again, there are older arcade games with EPROMs which are 20+ years old and still work just fine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It could be so that the UV light removes the charge in the cells rather than builds it up, I'm no expert on that. But we do know for certain that the erasing process results in a memory with all bits sit and that programming causes them to be clear and that you cannot reverse that without erasing. I don't know that I've seen any definitive sources on exactly how an EPROM works that you can be sure is true.

His explanation seems to agree with wiki and makes sense to me atleast.  Programming the bit stores electrons in the gate of the transitor, shining UV light of the right wavelength strips electrons from the gate (which jives with my and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect" class="postlink">wiki's</a> knowledge of the photoelectric effect.)  But there are many ways for electrons to leave the gate especially since they don't like each other...  Heat, time, EMF, light, eventually you won't have enough electrons on the gate to keep the bit programmed to a '0' and it'll 'bit rot' to a '1' (unprogrammed).<br /><br />As an aside, non-windowed OTP EPROMs are actually X-ray erasable EPROMs (or gamma if you want to be extreme), vice UV-erasable EPROMs. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Luckily EPROMs weren't cost effective at the time of the NES, and we got good old non-bit rotable mask ROMs in games.

It's possible for any chip to fail, but it'd be more likely for the address decoder or something that switches to fail than an individual bit.  That and those types of fails would be induced to to wear vice sitting on a shelf and 'rotting'.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />INL, yes all the wording gets confusing. Some of it would be that you'd expect the UV light to be charging and the programming to be emptying/losing something. You say it has to do with the opposite, that UV light depletes the cells of electrons. So then bit rot would be bits turning to 1 as they lose electrons. <br /><br />MaskROMs are still and were in the past more cost effective than EPROM or EEPROM. But nowdays 3DS and PS Vita cards may just contain NAND flash memory similar to SD cards rather than MaskROMs. GBA used MaskROMs, I think Nintendo DS did too, though I think those were serial memories and not parallel. 3DS could still be MaskROMs of some sort. If anybody knows for sure that would be interesting to know. Flash has gotten so cheap so who knows.
