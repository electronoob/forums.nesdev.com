For the bugs - I've somehow lost track about what is still wrong. The &quot;donate for update&quot; idea has been rather contraproductive for getting bug reports :-/ the good news is that bug reports for v1.2 will still apply for v1.3 so everybody can see what is wrong with this emu.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">May I ask if fullscreen would be too much to add? A mode that runs fullscreen at 512x448 (2x blocky scaled) would be wonderful</div><br />Yeah, isn't my personal priority, but should be a must-have feature... it is somewhere on my todo list. Programming it isn't really difficult - but somehow uncomfortable (a bunch of small details to be recursed).<br /><br />The normal way to go would be somehow scaling the image to the current screen resolution, like 1280x1024 or whatever you have, eventually recursing the SNES aspect ratio. Doing that scaling by software would be endless slow, and my attempts to use hardware accellerated scaling via OpenGL and DirectDraw have been rather disappointing.<br /><br />The other way would be switching to 640x480 pixel mode, scaling would be faster in that case, but the mode switching would be 2-3 seconds (on my computer at least... maybe better monitors/drivers can be doing it faster... or even slower?) - if you want to frequently switch from one window to another then it'd be useless annoying. Though if you want to play continously for next some hours then a few 2-3 second delays might be acceptable?<br /><br />On &quot;wide&quot; screens, I think 640x480 pixels would work, but the pixels would become horizontally stretched to non-square ratio, right? In case of the SNES, that might be a &quot;desired dirt effect&quot;.

I could just pick Port 21FFh, which shouldn't be used for other purposes.<br /><br />But if possible, I would stick with existing &quot;standards&quot;. How are other SNES emulators doing character output? What I/O address(es) are they using? Which emulator(s) do support character output? Are there any?<br /><br />PS. same question also for the NES (in case anybody here knows anything about NES char output).

There's also a new 21MHz timer mapped to reading port 21FCh. And the VRAM viewer is now supporting the Tile View pages (with scrollbars to view the whole 64Kbytes of VRAM).<br /><br />The NSS arcade cabinet emulation is now looking much nicer &amp; does now works with all existing 12 games - with thanks to DogP for datasheet, font-dump, and prom-tests.<br /><br />And finally - the one thing that everybody has waited for: The Exertainment Bicycle is now emulated - so you can now do all the hot exercising at home (by just pushing your analog gamepad forward) - with thanks to byuu for identifying the exertainment's rs232 chipset.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, baseball bat would be also interesting. Though it seems to be quite dumb - just simulating a normal joypad.<br />As far as I understand, there aren't any direction/position sensors, and reportedly not even speed/strength sensors, and swinging the thing just &quot;pushes&quot; a joypad button. Or are there more features in there?<br />The biggest secret that I am aware of are the four DIP switches, I would assume that they just allow to map the swing sensor to A,B,X,Y joypad buttons (?)<br /><br />The TeeV golf club is bit more intelligent - I don't really know how it works - but it seems to be able to sense speed/strenght, and probably also if you've missed the ball, and it appears to generate game-specific joypad signals (via it's game-specific &quot;bios&quot; cartridge).<br /><br />The Lasebirdie golf club is pretty different: it doesn't simulate joypad signals, and instead it's transferring some special analog stuff, probably with hit/miss, speed/strenth, and maybe even direction information.
