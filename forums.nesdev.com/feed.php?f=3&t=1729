The FDS BIOS loads the contents of the config file as it's scanning disk (side) &quot;A&quot;, in doing so it configures two of the copier's internal registers and boostraps it's own internal BIOS for control (to facilitate loading the subsequent disks). The file may or may not also hold the game's &quot;catalog number&quot; so the disk or disk image can be easily identified, but that information is just ignored as nothing's mapped there in the hardware. The letters generally correspond to a game's size and/or mapper, and letters to a release number (these were published in Hong Kong/Taiwan game shop flyers and magazines.) The Nintendo header area is also frequently embellished a little with copier related extensions, but aside from extending the disk count I'm not sure they mean much.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Sat May 19, 2018 6:58 pm</p><hr />

Nothing like resurrecting a ten year old topic, and I think this question should be in the hardware section, but anyway...<br /><br />What is the format of the 8 byte copier header/config data?  From analysis (of the three disks I have) I have deduced that the middle 4 bytes are some kind of name/ident string.  But what about the first two bytes and the last two bytes?  How do they work and what do they do?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3730">deadbody</a> — Tue Jan 12, 2016 7:44 am</p><hr />

They probably are but there's no reason why Magic Card images couldn't be ".ffe" (which I've seen people use back when un-iNESed images were still available) or something entirely new. People could also rename their .SMC ROMs to .SWC (it supersedes .SMC) and associate all SMC to a NES emulator.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Wed Jul 05, 2006 11:18 am</p><hr />

I don't think there can be such a thing as proper iNES support, proper support would be to get rid of the iNES header and use normal SMC images. The trainer section of iNES is necessary if you're going to use the FFE images.<br />Trainers are code loaded into $7000 before the game starts, they usually just contain a few bankswitching routines. To "train" a game, you generally replace a STA $E000 with JSR $7018 where $7018 is a routine to preform that specific bankswitch.<br /><br />I meant hack as in modify the game to use trainer routines or directly access the unit's bankswitch registers instead of say MMC1's.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Wed Jul 05, 2006 10:51 am</p><hr />

As far as I know I own every revision of every Famicom copier (except for the Dr PC Jr which arguably isn't a copier.) I won't post pictures (they can be found elsewhere) but I can talk a little about them. <br /><br />They hijack the system around when the Nintendo header loads in the FDS BIOS (they all load game images from 2.8" disks.) They <strong>cannot</strong> backup games, their GUI is a simple "Insert Disk A,B,C,D [sic]" prompt. After loading the disks, the game starts.<br /><br />The games are organized into FDS blocks, there is a block for the copier header (generally two bytes which configure the mode), a block for a "trainer" if present, then the blocks for program ROM followed by character ROM.<br /><br />The earliest units could only play these modes (which were 99% of the games in 1987):<br /><br />--PPPPCC (extended CNROM)<br />----PPPP (UOROM)<br />--CCPPPP (reverse mode 1)<br />--CC--PP (GNROM)<br /><br />Then support was added for trained games to support MMC1 and other 3rd party hardware. As I said earlier another mode was added which made $8000/A000/C000/E000 banks swappable.<br /><br />Until 1989, all units were logical clones of Bung's Game Doctor line (74 series/SPLD) with either original or hacked BIOS, in 1989 proprietary ASIC units came out. Each company (there are really only 3: Bung, Venus and Front Fareast) had their own style of PHI2 IRQ counter and included character ROM emulation with 1k switching instead of using CNROM style CRAM bankswitching.<br /><br />The Super Magic Card ("FFE") is an exception in that it comes with built in 3.5" support and PC link and a GUI to manage files on the disk. The basic "FFE" image format (512b header) is:<br /><br />first 8 bytes - legacy copier header block<br />ID bytes - AAh BBh<br />rest - 00h<br />followed by PRG then CHR ROM.<br /><br />The earliest (1M) units use the FDS RAM adapter to decode $6000-7FFF, this means of course the area is volatile and saves aren't kept. Units by Front Fareast decode WRAM to a local SRAM and is retained by the unit's power supply or battery pack. Starting with the ASIC units the copiers had either a real time save addon device (Venus units) or it built in (Bung/Front Fareast) operated by a pushbutton (Venus/Front Fareast) or a button sequence (Bung). Bung's technology for real time save is used in the Game Action Replay (which was developed by the man behind all Bung products)<br /><br />Basically all you can do with FC copiers is playback games (which you would have had to hack yourself or purchase illegally from a vendor.) Because earlier units had to make due with 4x8k SRAM banks, trainers often had to turn off rendering, transfer character data from CPU RAM to CRAM by way of $2007 and resume. This causes the screen to flicker of course, in games that bankswitch often, this flicker can be REALLY annoying. Should a trainer make the game logic spill into another frame, this causes slowdown as well.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Wed Jul 05, 2006 8:38 am</p><hr />

I don't know about iNES, but UNIF should define a board type for each kind of copier hardware, where the PRG and CHR are as expected and a third chunk specifies the copier configuration, such as the fusemap for a cart with a CPLD mapper or the header for the FFE copier.
