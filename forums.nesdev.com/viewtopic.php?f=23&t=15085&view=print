I do find it interesting it has an SD card slot + includes an SD card with 22 games, while simultaneously supporting cartridges (smells like a Genesis version of the Retron 5 -- except this is apparently a Sega-sanctioned product).<br /><br />We have enough Portuguese-speaking folks here that if someone needs something translated from the pre-order page, it shouldn't be a problem.

In all other countries of the world, it is called &quot;Sega Mega Drive&quot;, and &quot;Genesis&quot; refers to the first book of the Torah/Old Testament and to a music pop group from the 80s.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Tectoy has been re-releasing the sega genesis and master system non stop since the 90's. It's just that this time they listened to the fans on facebook for feedback on what they wanted. Still, not everything seems to be great, so you can wait and see or you can support the direction they are going by pre-ordering. I chose to do so, but it is a high risk, because recent history shows they use bad GOACs. I can only hope that they took into account what everyone said about quality first. But the fact that it isn't compatible with any peripheral sucks really bad.<br /><br />I'm not sure where they stand with sega today (I'd say that now have a green card to do anything they want with sms and genesis, apparently), but yeah, they were the official sega publishers in brazil in the 90's.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From what we know so far, it seems that it copies the games to its own RAM in order to run them. This conclusion is based on the fact that, in addition to using cartridges, it can also load games from the SD card, and that &quot;special&quot; cartridges and accessories don't work. Unfortunately, it does look like they're using a SOAC, considering their comments about the inaccurate (&quot;not identical to the original&quot;) sound and the fact that it only outputs composite video.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Can confirm that the MD was called the Genesis in Canada.<br /><br />I wouldn't be surprised if it's emulation - economy of scale means that an ARM microcontroller (as a guess) would be way way cheaper than the alternatives.<br /><br />Pretty much everything in the Genny besides the VDP is an off-the-shelf component and AFAIK still in production. I wonder if there's a market for a &quot;premium&quot; clone using real parts, maybe with a FPGA based VDP? It'd be pricey, but so is the Analogue NT...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Conjecture:<br />It's possible for the input layer to be emulated even if the CPU, memory controller, VDP, and FM aren't. The front-end processor reads the gamepads 60 times a second and then hands the signal off to the Mega Drive SoC hardware. This means things relying on nonstandard read timing, such as the mouse, won't work for much the same reason that anything but a standard NES controller won't work through a Four Score or Satellite adapter.

And it doesn't sound like they're making something of their own this time either. They constantly say in the FAQ that the original components aren't manufactured anymore, and this is why they're using &quot;similar&quot; parts. They're clearly not making new chips, just using whatever is already out there.<br /><br />Again, we'll have to wait until we can know for sure.
