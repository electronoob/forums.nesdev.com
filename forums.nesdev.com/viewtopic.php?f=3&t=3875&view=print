Others will allow you to select the location of the FDS BIOS somewhere in their configuration menus. Just read the documentation of the emulator you're using, they probably say something about the FDS.

<br />
<br />actually I said "searched the internet" as to say "I used a general search engine (google)" and then "searched this forum" meaning I used the search feature of this forum specifically.  Anyway, I know HOW to get this to work, I just need to know where the FDS BIOS file is to actually do it.

<br />
<br />RockNES or Nestopia for Mac OS X (I prefer Nestopia)
<br />
<br />Why should that matter though, isn't it a general file?
<br />
<br />Yes, I know Google doesn't spider the entire internet (though I believe its pretty close), if someone says they searched their house for something, I doubt they literally mean they covered every square inch of every cabinet, box, etc.  
<br />
<br />I figured that if anyone would know where to get it, it would be the people at nesdev, since, after all, that's some vital stuff for an emulator programmer.

<br />You can get it by buying the FDS RAM cart, soldering together a dumper, and dumping it. Or you can get it by buying a Famicom and FDS, soldering together an fdsloader cable, and using fdsloader to send a dumping program to the FDS. As far as I can tell, these are the only ways to get a copy of the FDS BIOS that are consistent with countries' statutory exceptions to Nintendo's exclusive right to reproduce or distribute copies of the FDS BIOS.
<br />
<br />I wonder if it can be extracted from Famicom Mini carts or the Japanese version of Animal Crossing for GameCube...

I will not tell you the search term I used because that could be construed as incitement to infringe copyright, and we all know how anal N is about copyright (so much so that they even lie about the legality of emulators because they don't even want to acknowledge the homebrew scene at all).

<br />
<br />well then every repro out there is illegal, because none of them have the consent of the copyright holder.
<br />
<br />Anyway, back on topic, just for fun I decided to do the long and arduous task of dumping the BIOS from my own FDS and have put it in the folder for Nestopia.  Now, it boots and gives me the screen, but it says "please set disk card" when I tried to load the rom.  Is there a button or something I need to push for it to start "reading" the game?
