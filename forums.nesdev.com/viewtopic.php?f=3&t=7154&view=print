		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had always planned on adding image support to the XML, but never got around to adding it to the spec. Here is a quick rundown of planned XML changes. If you have ideas to make it better, by all means, let me know.
<br />
<br />Always though it would be cool to be able load up a game thru an interface something like <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?imagetype_op=%3D&amp;imagetype=Cart+Top&amp;field=2&amp;order=asc&amp;rfa=21+1+2+11+3+6+9+10+32+23" class="postlink">this</a>.
<br />
<br />FYI, there is a modular form of the XML for doing rom sets. Not sure if the spec was ever really announced, I can write something up for this later, just mentioning it because these changes apply to it as well.
<br />
<br />Some website specific ties will need to be added to the XML for this to work.
<br />
<br />XML additions:
<br />&lt;database&gt; Add attribute "website" with value set to base url of database site, currently <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/">http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Something will need to define the script names to call from the site too.
<br />
<br />&lt;cartridge&gt; Add attribute "id" with value set to database CartID (the profile #)
<br />
<br />new tag &lt;images&gt; nested in &lt;cartridge&gt; No attributes.
<br />
<br />new tag &lt;image&gt; nested in &lt;images&gt; One of these for each image available. 
<br />
<br />&lt;image&gt; Attributes:
<br />"type" would be set to Cart Front, PCB Front, etc.
<br />"id" would be set to database ImageID number.
<br />"file" to point to a local image file. This would supercede "id" if present. You could implement a cache system this way too. Initially download it based on ID and then write the "file" attrib to the XML so in the future it would load from there. 
<br />
<br />Some additional attribs that could maybe useful:
<br />"dpi" = source image resolution
<br />"width" &amp; "height" = source image dimensions
<br />"filesize" = source image filesize
<br />"timestamp" = when source image was uploaded
<br />"author" = person who uploaded it
<br />
<br />These could be used by a program to decided if it wants to download or not, or if an updated image is available, etc.
<br />
<br />Here on the server side, I will need to write up a script to serve these images. You will be able to request a specific size of the image, width in pixels would likely be most appropriate for use in a GUI. Other params would be ImageID to request a specific image. CartID + image type for finding a suitable image when a directly linked one is not available. 
<br />
<br />One thing to keep in mind that will probably be a nuisance is that multiple images will be available per game. If your emulator is looking up a game based on CRC32, it has no way to tell which profile it should be looking at.
<br />
<br />For example, you load up Super Mario Bros ROM, get its CRC of D445F69 and look thru the XML for matches. Currently that's 13. SMB happens to be the same across all regions. So which scan should it load? Famicom or NES? USA? The 3-screw or the 5-screw version? The one with the old seal or the new seal? The one with or without the serial number? The one bert uploaded or the one ernie uploaded? You get the idea.
<br />
<br />Of course most apps wouldn't really care about these specifics, however I think most would want some sort of consistency rather than the first image it happens to find. So some sort of priority system should be defined.

<br />Yeah, that's a major bummer.  I didn't realize that so many different versions of a game could all have the same CRC. :-/  I think that adding a priority system to break all those ties could/would become extremely arbitrary...I wonder if there is a better way?  Because then people are going to be like, "Hey, why is such-and-so version higher priority than this-and-that version". And blah blah blah.
<br />
<br />Need to think about it this one...I think probably just narrowing it down using system (NES/Famicom), then country would get you really close to what you're looking for...
<br />
<br />But now I'm thinking you probably don't even need/want to add a priority system to _your_ database.  I would just leave yours as is and let everyone code their emulators to pick custom user preferences/priority of which matching ROM database option they would like to see first (so then it's customized to each user's priority).  The emulator could also then allow the user to flip through the other matches if they wanted to.  The emulator window could say something like "12 additional matches. Click here to display full list."  Or whatever.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well I figured the script could be called in 3 ways:
<br />
<br />1. Specify ImageID and it returns that exact image
<br />2. Specify CartID and ImageType and it returns an image that matches the properties of specified CartID. This is how the website does it.
<br />3. Specify hash and ImageType and some sort of priorities.
<br />
<br />Perhaps just the system would suffice, e.g. NES-NTSC, NES-PAL, or Famicom which more or less also defines the general region (North America, Europe, and Japan) and maybe a flag to let it know if it can return only system specified or if it's allowed to check others. I guess you could optional request specific region and that would take highest priority.
<br />
<br />Most label differences within the same region are so trivial that many people wouldn't even notice. There are some cases where they are significantly different though. Some that come to mind are Metroid, Untouchables, and Gun Smoke.
<br />
<br />Nice thing about the 3rd option is that anything could use it, you wouldn't even have to reference the XML. I can easily see this being the most attractive option.

<br />Agreed - I'd love to integrate the cart image into my emu using option 3.  Very low barrier to entry.  Have you considered adding multiple images per game?  Imagine being able to grab not only the top label image, but also the front label and the box art.  Regardless, the label tops would really help punch up my <a href="http://img405.imageshack.us/img405/5816/dbbrowser.png" class="postlink">current game brower</a>.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />EDIT: I see that you have all kinds of images in your database; disregard my previous question. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Going one more step forward, it would also be nice to get 3D mesh data from the server so that clients can construct models of the box, cart, etc and present to the user in the game browser if they want.

<br />
<br />Agreed, you know a couple years ago I seriously considered getting this <a href="https://www.nextengine.com/" class="postlink">3D scanner</a>, which is just bad-ass. It can create a fully textured model for you, which could then be worked into a flash animation or something to use on the site. 2 big pitfalls though, 1. It's $3000, pretty steep for a hobby project. 2. To fully model an object takes something like 14 minutes IIRC.
<br />
<br />Anyways, this is still something I'd like to see, and if I knew anything about 3d modeling, I would do so myself. So if anyone is handy in this area and wants to help, let me know! I'm not holding my breath though... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />So Luke, what is that browser? For an emulator of yours or some type of universal front-end?
<br />
<br />I already wrote up a script for this and jwdonal has done some testing with it in his emulator and it seems to be working ok. If you'd like to try it out, shoot me a PM and I can set you up. If anyone emu or front end authors wants to play with it, let me know. Your app will need to be able to do basic HTTP stuff like POST and GET requests for it to work. You'll also need to register a user / pass on the website if you don't already have one.
<br />
<br />All 3 methods I mentioned are implemented, but until those ID's go into the XML, the CRC32 lookup is the only practical one for now.

<br />BootGod, am I correct that you mean that the entire ROMs of all these versions match, not just the CRCs? In other words, this isn't due to a deficiency of CRC32, but of using the ROM contents as a unique identifier. Put another way, even a NES couldn't tell the difference between these (given a suitable adapter for the Famicom versions); only someone looking at the case could.

<br />Glad you like it!  It's from <a href="http://www.ubernes.com" class="postlink">my emulator</a>.   I manually transcribed the text from the boxes for about 150 of the most common/popular US games into a database that is baked into the EXE.  If I were to re-do the design, I would definitely try to tie into an online database like BootGods with scans of the box fronts and backs instead.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Haha, oh man, that must have take a while.  Let me know if you're willing to share the transcriptions so that i can add them to my emulator GUI.  I would give you credit of course (e.g. "Transcription courtesy of Ubernes" or something).
<br />
<br />Also, BootGod might be interested in adding them to his database.  I think it would be trivial to add another key-value pair in his database for this.

<br />
<br />Note that this is all the same hardware and the pro thing is just software. So I guess the performance of the standard edition is intentionally crippled to be slower and lower res.

<br />And perhaps what I got out of it is that the high-end software incorporates patented processes that they couldn't include in the standard software without having to pay someone a hefty royalty. Royalty rates are part of why Wii and DSi play MP4 audio rather than MP3 audio, why GIMP doesn't support PANTONE colors, and allegedly why the NES has sprite 0 instead of a proper vcount interrupt.
