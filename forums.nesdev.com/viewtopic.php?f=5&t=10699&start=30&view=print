Unlike the Genesis/MD and SNES versions, which are nearly identical (although I have the impression that both aren't as polished as the NES version), the Game Boy one is a completely different game under the same name.<br /><br />EDIT: Checked the SNES version and it's actually not as similar to the NES version as I thought, but it's still the same game. The Genesis port is pretty close to the NES version though, only with worse graphics. The 16-bit versions somehow manage to look worse than the 8-bit version... How can they screw this up!?

I checked it against the original &quot;Contra&quot; and it's different. The graphics are different and the player character walks slower on the Game Boy.<br /><br />I was talking about games that are really astonishingly similar, with the same graphics and the same gameplay. Games that are just &quot;Hey, they caught the atmosphere of the NES game pretty well&quot; aren't enough. &quot;Operation C&quot; isn't anymore like &quot;Contra&quot; as &quot;Metroid&quot; and &quot;Metroid II&quot; are alike.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">strat wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Batman</div><br />What???<br /><br /><img src="http://i42.tinypic.com/vxlqts.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/2cy1c3c.png" alt="Image" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, I remembered Operation C being more accurate than it is.  Here's a question:  Would you count Adventure Island III (GB II) if he throws the axe at a different arc?  The jumping physics are identical, although there's a bit more friction when he turns around on GB (Not really an issue since Adventure Island as a rule discourages you from turning around).<br /><br />For the record, if we did this topic with SNES and GB games, I would totally not count Donkey Kong Land.

Cool Spot is a port of the same game on SNES.<br /><br />By the way, in case it's not clear, that list I posted above were games I was wondering about but didn't feel like checking.
