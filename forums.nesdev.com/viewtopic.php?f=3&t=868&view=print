That comes out to 14-18MHz. It's written as a large switch statement with function calls for access to I/O registers; no assembly is used. Considering how much time is available on even a slow computer like my Mac, a CPU emulator that ran three times slower would still be plenty fast (though it would make it harder to have a <a href="http://www.io.com/~greens/temp/nes_wall.png" class="postlink">"live" ROM browser</a> running at 60fps).

<br />
<br />Oddly enough, this same CPU core, along with my per-cycle APU core, takes less than 3% CPU on my 1000MHz P3 when playing an NSF in my Winamp plugin. I suppose this is at least partially due to caching issues.

<br />
<br />This would be expected, unless your NSF engine converts the NSF file into a NES ROM before playing it. Most NSF play routines just do some APU writes and then return, at which point the NSF player would then skip to the next 1/60 second rather than emulating an "forever: jmp forever" until the next NMI occurred.

<br />
<br />That's the thing - my NSF engine <strong>DOES</strong> effectively convert the NSF file into an NES ROM before playing it, using a ~256 byte BIOS mapped at $3F00-$3FFF and some I/O registers at $3E00-$3E13 (for reading the NSF header, interfacing with the GUI, and handling the interrupt rate) and hijacking the RESET and IRQ vectors during interrupts, and it DOES emulate a "loop: JMP loop" until the next IRQ comes along.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I find this subject interesting, as I decided for the heck of it (boredom mainly) to write an NES CPU core to see if I could do it.  The fun part here is I am using a variant of BASIC (namely FutureBasic) for the Mac.  Much faster than other BASICs for the Mac, but much slower than comparable C code.  On my 1GHz PowerMac G4, my core currently requires around 25-30% the amount of time the real NES needs, a figure that I can almost certainly improve since the current implementation isn't well optimized at all (a lot of subrouine/function calls at present, not much inline stuff).  Someone writing in C should have zero trouble getting a CPU core running well fast enough for any of today's superfast systems.
<br />
<br />If I figure a way to do it, I might try a PPU core as well, but I'll be shocked if FutureBasic lets me do that in enough time (I certainly won't be able to with its built-in features, as its drawing is embarrassingly slow - I'd have to call the Mac API directly to even have a shot).

<br />
<br />A good way to emulate the PPU with regards to the OS is to render pixels directly, then use a single OS call to draw it on screen. For the Mac, you should be able to use an 8-bit or 16-bit GWorld and directly access its pixels (use NewGWorld, GetGWorldPixMap, LockPixels, GetPixBaseAddr, and GetPixRowBytes, then CopyBits, or send me a private message).
