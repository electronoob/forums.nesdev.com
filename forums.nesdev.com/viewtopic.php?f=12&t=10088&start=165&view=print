My software can erase any SNES INL cart, and <em>should</em> program any Rom except the Star Ocean <em>interleaved</em> Rom and similar one-off exceptions. A deinterleaved Star Ocean Rom should program just fine, in theory...though thinking back it might be 'Re-Addressed' and write all wrong. I'll double-check that, but I'm coming up on a significant increase over the weekend here, so wether it works or not as of Release 10, it will work with Release 11.. Can't promise Star Ocean <em>deinterleaving</em> for Release 11, but we'll see how it goes. However, it's movie night, so further progress tonight will not happen. Enjoy your weekend guys!

Last time I bought one, I ran into the same problems I was having now, but at some point it programmed randomly so I didn't look into the matter further.<br /><br />I bought another two boards and am having trouble again. Everything goes well until for the erasing, but when I go to load star ocean, and hit write, it crashes after 5 seconds. It just says &quot;not responding&quot;. The one time it did work, I never got a green bar, but I did get the data onto the board and the game worked. So i'm not sure what to do.

It just says &quot;not responding&quot;.</div><br />INL's stock app does this. It seemingly hangs during writes because there's no callback to the OS to tell it &quot;I'm still alive&quot; during its work loop - it literally just pretends it's locked up until it's done.<br />1) Just keep waiting until it finishes. It hasn't actually crashed. Don't click the window, don't press any keys, don't even move the mouse through the window. If Windows complains, tell it to wait. It'll take about 12 minutes to write a full 12MByte ROM to a 12MByte cart. I'm tempted to fix this issue and re-release it, simply so legacy users have something to use if mine fails.<br />2) Use my new host app. Star Ocean 12MByte <em>deinterleaved</em> is untested, but should be supported. Star Ocean 12MByte <em>interleaved</em> will fail.

This included Final Fantasy 3, V and VI. After much testing and trouble shooting, Danin and I discovered the problem was with my SNES itself. We're not sure as of WHY yet, but we're positive that's it. <br /><br />When I took my INL carts to my local game store to test there, they all worked perfectly (with and without an official power supply). I tried a cleaning kit and still no dice. So yeah, the INL carts work just fine. I'll update my old post shortly to make sure new people don't get discouraged.

We're not sure as of WHY yet, but we're positive that's it.</div><br />To further comment on this, here's my <em>current</em> opinion as a preliminary diagnosis (as a repair tech without access to the device); it doesn't act up on normal games because the INL carts (and most other aftermarket carts) draw slightly more power from the system due to having more components (CPLD, level converters, etc) and consoles with aged and/or failing capacitors (either in the console or power supply itself) could introduce noise into the cart's power and subsequently all related systems (main processor, video ram, DSP, etc) due to power drain effecting other circuits) that cause instability. I'm not sure why some games cause problems and others don't - I suspect it has something to do with the intensity of processing operations. I'll update if I get the opportunity to do further investigation, but my current expectation is to see failing/failed capacitors either the PSU or console.<br /><br />EDIT: I should also note that yes, I was incorrect with my suspicion of the carts themselves, but I had failed to consider the fact that these consoles are clearly quite old. I did jump the gun on diagnosis. Capacitors (yes, my current suspect) are typically an age-related failure, whereas the logic ICs and processors are low-speed (relatively) and low-heat devices and as such are suspect of a much lower failure rate, in my estimation. We'll see if/how this one pans out.

If I find that they are a problem, I can offer repair service for them at low cost. Until then - and you have no reason to trust me so I don't assume there will be many takers - I'll examine one or two consoles sent to me <em>by people having this problem</em>, repair them, and return them no charge. Well...you pay shipping both ways. But other than that, no charge. I'll also want the cart(s) that are having problems, programmed with a game that's having problems for testing before and after repairs. Again, nobody here necessarily has any reason to trust me, but I assure you I'm not the dishonest sort. If you're interested, PM me.

First time I programmed the board, it didn't work, but after 3 or 4 attempts, it did. I updated the ROM I wanted to burn on it (I'm translating Romancing Saga 3 into spanish and I test it on the real thing when I compile a new patch) and the game didn't run after re-programming the board several times (7 or so). Annoyed about this, I tried with the new host app, and I finally got to work the board after changing some options.<br />All this occurred 2 weeks ago, but today I updated the ROM again and decided to play it on the Super Famicom: it has been more than an hour re-programming the board with the new host app, with the old host app, with any possible option checked and then uncheked and finally, after more than <span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">10 attempts</span>, I can conclude that these boards don't worth the effort nor the money.<br />Besides, the contact with InfiniteNesLives is ABSOLUTELY impossible: he takes weeks to answer, he reads my private messages but doesn't reply at all, and I guess he has no idea about what's happening with his own boards...<br /><br />Really dissapointing...

I'm not sure if SFC boards require as careful insertion as the SNES boards, but I know the SNES boards do have to be placed carefully.

Right-click Find Kazzo and click Test Read. When it's done, it'll load that Rom into the tab on the right - if it shows as invalid, it's not being written properly. If it shows as valid, click Save Buffer, save it someplace, and use a tool (WinHex, etc) to run a difference check on the Rom you wrote and the Rom you just saved. It'll have to be a headerless Rom and the buffer will have to be saved as headerless as well. If there are no differences between the dump and the Rom, it is being written correctly, and the issue lies in the hardware between the flash and the console, OR the CIC itself, in my opinion.

Given your test grouping, I think you might be correct that it's not the CIC, which leaves odd issues and board spacing in the programmer as suspect. Or simply an issue with the board itself not properly programming. If that's the case, let me know and I'll see if there's anything I can do from my end to fix it. Maybe a program/verify pass or something..
