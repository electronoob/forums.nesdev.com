I have seen write limits as low as 1000 cycles on those, but even the typical 10000 could fail after years of use. That would have to be extremely frequent resetting!</div>
<br />
<br />That is very refreshing to read.  If its SRAM based, it will probably still work after you and I are dead.

<br />Yes, I thought about that as well.  Is there a NES emulator that does use all the info (headers, etc) so I can narrow this down?  The list of games with minor graphical defects is growing here.

You can also try Nintendulator if you're using Windows.
<br />
<br />If you're seeing minor graphical glitches in many games, however, I'm not so sure that can be explained by corrupted headers.  I'm wondering if maybe the CHR SRAM chip is bad, causing certain addresses to fail (which in turn would corrupt any graphics at those locations).  Hopefully I am wrong here.

<br />Yeah, I've seen no graphical corruption in the menus.  As I try more games, I'm seeing more (of the same minor) problems.  I've checked the header info (for Excitebike for example) which seems correct, and I've tried roms other than my own, and had the same issues.  Also have tried different CFs.  While I can never for instance get Excitebike to run without corruption, if I use my actual cart it works fine.
<br />
<br />Also - I've noticed that some games will occasionally start without corruption (DK3 as an example), and play OK.  And sometimes they'll start corrupting ingame.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />
<br />If you haven't replaced the connector inside the NES, you might consider doing that and seeing if that helps (both with the PowerPak and with other cartridges).  My brother replaced the connector in my NES a couple of years ago, and it's amazing how much better the system works now.

<br />I replaced the connector with a new one last year, so I know its not a dirt/fatigue issue.  That and the fact that I have no problem with all my other carts.

I don't believe it's a connector issue, something physically different inside certain NES consoles isn't playing nice with the PowerPak.
<br />
<br />This reminds me of a very similar issue I have with one of my pirate Famicom carts, Adventure Island 3. When inserted into a Famicom, or an NES (toaster OR top-loader) with a Gyromite adapter, the game works fine; however, switching to another, somewhat longer (though identically wired) adapter, or adding a Game Genie, will cause some sprites to flicker and show the wrong graphics. My guess is that the pirate MMC3 is timed so precisely that adding something between the cart and console can interfere with the signal just enough to break it. Perhaps something similar is happening here?
