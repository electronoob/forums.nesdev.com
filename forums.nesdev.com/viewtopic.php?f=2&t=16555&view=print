		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here's an idea that may or may not be useful, but I thought it would be worth sharing here. So the frame counter allows for clocking the length counters at a ~96Hz rate with the 5-step mode selected, and writing to $4017 clocks all the hardware timer units. By writing $18 to $400F and then $C0 to $4017 at the end of VBlank, you could set up another (albeit fixed timer) flag ($4015 noise bit) to poll for a raster effect that would be reliably lowered after 14 914 CPU cycles, since the $4017 write immediately decrements the 2-clock length counter table entry you have selected in $400F. Once the flag is lowered, an immediate write to $400F with say $08 would ensure that then oise channel would immediately start playing again, without causing any audible artifacts in the sound.<br />Could this be useful for a two-player split-screen game for example? (Provided that the first half of the frame can be filled with fixed-time or mostly fixed-time processes)

The &quot;length counter&quot; is ticked 2 times per frame, and can be synchronized with $4017 writes.<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure why noise specifically is being suggested here. Wouldn't this work with any channel? The triangle's &quot;linear counter&quot; has a 4x per frame resolution instead, which might be more useful. I guess probably the brief interruption of noise would be the least noticeable of the 4 channels...? I think on any channel that's not silent you will get a 60hz buzz from the regular interruption, but it might be acceptably quiet.<br /><br />The big drawback here is just not being able to time it very conveniently. You can't easily move it around like sprite 0. Seems like even DPCM would usually be a better option with its IRQ.<br /><br />You could even position $4017's IRQ directly by writing it mid-screen. (Though it might start to gradually slip vs. NMI? I don't think it has the exact same timing as the NMI, but I haven't tested it.)

It would be wayyy more useful if it was slightly shorter than NMI instead. :/

Since the write immediately decrements the length counter of the channel in question, only 2 frame counter steps out of the 5 have to occur before the length counter gets clocked again, which amounts to 7456.5 APU cycles.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'm not exactly sure why noise specifically is being suggested here.

Also, the linear counter stopping the channel is not reflected in the state of the triangle flag at $4015, all of those bits care about the corresponding length counters only.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Speaking of silly stupid ideas, you could also start with a sprite 0 hit, then set an APU frame IRQ to go off one frame and ~200 dots later.  The Frame IRQ could interrupt code that runs long and prevents the sprite 0 polling loop from getting reached in time.<br /><br />APU frame IRQ has the advantage of not interfering with anything else sound-wise, except for the sweep trick to set high bits of square channels.  Nobody should be using the length counters and envelopes anyway.
