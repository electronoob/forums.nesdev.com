<br />
<br />'More than NROM' support is already there, but I don't plan to make animation functions, as the tool certainly wasn't designed for such things. I only had thoughts about fast switch between many nametable files, to make multiple screen edit faster.

My other keyboard doesn't even have lights, probably to conserve power since it's wireless.  And the keyboard I'm currently using doesn't have scroll lock and numlock is also out of the question...
<br />
<br />I understand why it might be easier to check caps/scroll lock mode.  I guess my biggest bother is the fact that my current mode while using your app also affects the mode of every other app I'm currently using on my computer.  I NEVER use caps lock so it's difficult to remember to turn it on and off all the time.  It become detrimental in Vi when hjkl are used to move the cursor and HJKL modify my code in undesirable ways.
<br />
<br />I'm down for holding a key while I select things similar to excel.

<br />
<br />I just have a question: Is there any way to take a shift-selected block from the tileset and apply it as a block to the nametable? I wasn't able to find any other way of transfering tiles from the tileset to the nametable apart of doing it one by one.
<br />
<br />Thanks!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Currently there is no such way. I thought to do it, it won't take much time, but I'm not sure about the logic. Is it OK that operations with copy/pasting graphics will change copy/paste buffer of nametable too? Or a separate key to paste selection from graphics into tileset without change of the buffer is a better idea?

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think that instead of copy-pasting between buffers, when you click on the nametable with <em>apply tiles</em> enabled it should apply tiles according to the selection on the tileset. In the case you have selected only one tile, it would behave like now, but if you have selected a block (and it also could work with discrete selections) all the selected tiles are inserted at the point you click on the nametable. It would work as some kind of "brush".
<br />
<br />Does it make sense?

You can create complex metasprites with non-regular grid aligned sprites, various palettes, horizontal and vertical flips. Beware the bugs and inconveniences, though, as currently I don't have time to make another NES game and test the new editor capabilities in real workflow.

Import BMP as a nametable now allows to use images of arbitrary size, not larger than 256x240.
