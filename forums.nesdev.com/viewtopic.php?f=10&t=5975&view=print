<br />You're not making a program to run on "modern PCs". You're making a program to run on a Nintendo Entertainment System. At power on, the contents of the internal RAM aren't predictable. Clearing everything helps define the environment in which your program runs.

I swapped to Mapper 0, progressed until it was a bit clear to me what am I doing, removed the .incbin, and found out I could only place up to 2 16kb PRG-ROM banks (.byte $02 instead of $10). That's not standard, right? How could I increase the ROM size (at the moment it's 32,784 bytes)? And where is the location of CHR-RAM anyways?

If you're just starting out, it's probably better to worry about mappers later, and just use standard NROM (mapper 0).  NROM is supposed to have CHR-ROM, but emulators allow you set the # of CHR pages to 0, giving you CHR-RAM instead.  I almost always use CHR-RAM, myself.
<br />
<br />CHR-RAM is in the same place as CHR-ROM, it's just that the CPU won't normally have a reason to access the ROM (when present).  This is mapped into $0000-$1FFF on the PPU's memory, and is accessed the same way nametables and palettes are (starting at $2000 in PPU memory).
<br />
<br />If you use mapper #7, there are 2 issues.  The main one is that you'll need vectors and a little boot code in every 32kB bank, because it will start up in a random one.  The other is "bus conflicts", try a search for that on here and if that doesn't help I'll explain it.  But for mapper #7 specifically, I think some (but not all) of the boards have a chip to work around bus conflicts.  Kind of a waste of an IC, IMHO, heheh. (unless there's some advantage I'm not aware of)

<br />
<br />I would first focus on making a no mapper rom work and learn to code the basics in it so you can get comfortable with programming.  By basic I mean to load name table data with attribute in your own format (metatile or not), learn how to define sprite, how to scroll, how to use the NMI the right moment etc.
<br />
<br />Once you can do all your basic things, which could be after a few months, a lot of things about the nes will become clearer and you will be able to make better decision. 
<br />
<br />For example, my current project that I'm working on (the MM9 proof of concept) uses a MMC3 but it doesn't need it at all: it could run on a no mapper rom properly. The only reason I use an MM3 is because that's the only dev cart I have at the moment <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Don't rush it for now, it's not hard to switch code from mapper to another when you just starting to experiment with the nes.

<br />
<br />If 4-screen mirroring is any good to you, you could consider that.  Only a couple games used it in the past, but it's trivial to add it to new cart (it's on my Squeedo mapper).

Do you want to simulate two independently scrolling planes, is that it? If so, mirroring doesn't have much to do with it.<br /><br />There are 2 common ways to simulate (yes, it's always fake because the NES has only 1 background plane and there is no way around it) multiple scrolling planes. One is to modify the horizontal scroll during rendering to divide the screen in stripes that can scroll independently. This is often referred to as "parallax". The disadvantage of this method is that one planes can never overlap, so this technique is very limited. Also, you have to use something to detect the exact time to change the scroll, such as sprite 0 hits, scanline counters, timed code, or a combination of those.<br /><br />The other method is to use a repetitive background and dynamically modify the tiles used to draw those parts, so that they appear to be scrolling differently from the foreground. The disadvantage is that you can't do this for detailed backgrounds and it if you use CHR-RAM it will take a lot of VBlank time to modify the tiles (I've only seen games with CHR-ROM using this trick, because they can easily bankswitch the needed tiles).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltuRuGM271Q&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=721298E8407243C3&amp;playnext=1&amp;playnext_from=PL&amp;index=49" class="postlink">Here is a video</a> with several games that use one technique or the other, some even use both (Sword Master). These are pretty tough tricks to pull off without mappers, but it's possible. But before trying you should study what these games are doing.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><em>E2:</em> hmm, I remember seeing a few months (years?) ago a good scrolling document on NESDev, but I can't seem to find it anymore. Got any suggestions?</div>
<br />As far as I know, there is no document describing tricks like the ones I mentioned above, I've only seen very simple and direct documents describing what the PPU registers related to scrolling do. Tricks are usually things you have to figure out for yourself, by looking at how the commercial games do it.
<br />
<br />What the technical documents describe is nothing amazing, because scrolling is a pretty simple thing actually. It's basically just you telling the PPU from where to start rendering every frame (using register <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_registers#Scroll_.28.242005.29_.3E.3E_write_x2" class="postlink">$2005</a>), or several times per frame. If you need to change the vertical scroll mid-screen you have to exploit some obscure PPU details explained in <a href="http://nesdev.com/loopyppu.zip" class="postlink">this document</a>.

<br />Actually Battletoads uses that effect for the second level where you're rappelling down the cave. But then again, Battletoads chops off a whole bunch of scanlines, so it has time to do a lot of writes to CHR-RAM.
<br />
<br />Also, here's a document which has a whole lot on scrolling, including how to do 4-screen scrolling with only two name tables: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://jonathan.microclub.ch/NES_raster/">http://jonathan.microclub.ch/NES_raster/</a><!-- m -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Your code seems correct, I think your problem is the palette. You have set the first color to white but all others to black. The thing is that some other colors map to the same phisical address as the first color, so you are replacing the white with black, so you only see black.
<br />
<br />Change you palette to:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">palette:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.db $30,$0f,$0f,$0f, $30,$0f,$0f,$0f, $30,$0f,$0f,$0f, $30,$0f,$0f,$0f<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.db $30,$0f,$0f,$0f, $30,$0f,$0f,$0f, $30,$0f,$0f,$0f, $30,$0f,$0f,$0f</div>
<br />And you should see something.
<br />
<br />EDIT: found the <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=21418#21418" class="postlink">post</a> saying what palette slots are mirrors. So when you wrote black to $3F10 you replaced the white at $3F00.
