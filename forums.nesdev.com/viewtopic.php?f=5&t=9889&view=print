He approached the magnets into the screen and... well, you know all those distorctions of color and shapes.<br /><br />I wonder if such thing is <strong>dangerous</strong>. Could someone comment it?<br /><br />(video in portuguese)<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=nZk--_Rh738">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=pl ...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wow, those patterns are really neat. It's interesting how it magnifies the shadow mask pattern.<br /><br />I don't see any danger, beyond ruining the monitor. At the very least, it'll magnetize the shadow mask in a way that perhaps the built-in degaussing coil won't demagnetize. It might also dislodge the mask due to the strength. It's behind really thick glass, so nothing will come through. I don't see any radiation danger either.<br /><br />With the CRT open, on the other hand, there are lots of dangers. The biggest is implosion of the CRT, because the neck on the back is very thin. Waving a screwdriver around it without eye protection is careless. And then there's the high voltage stored in the capacitor the CRT itself acts as.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Only danger is shadow mask dislocation but that is very hard to achieve as it is attached to the glass on all sides. The mask is really quite strong too, it is hard to rip it apart or wrinkle. Trinitrons have that aperture grille system and a good shock is all it takes to give the tube permanent discoloration.<br />I have messed around with magnets on my old TV, and I did sometimes get some semi-permanent discoloration that faded with time... or I'd take a weak magnet and &quot;pull it off the edge&quot;... that worked really well haha

And then there's the high voltage stored in the capacitor the CRT itself acts as.</div><br />My friend and I worked at his dad's monitor repair shop in high school.  Not surprisingly, for kids that age, we spent a lot of time destroying stuff that was beyond repair.  CRTs are really hard to break from the front.  The neck is comparatively easy to break, but I wouldn't necessarily say it's fragile; I don't recall one ever being non-intentionally broken.  The little nipple at the end of the neck is really easy to break and there were at least a couple of times that I heard the telltale hissing after I, or someone else, hit the circuit board attached to the neck the wrong way.  No implosion for that mistake, though.<br /><br />Getting shocked by a non-discharged CRT really sucks, but (circumstantially, at least) it's not fatal.  I'd say the biggest risk is probably the large electrolytic capacitors in the power supply section.<br /><br />The only cases where I've seen 'permanent' discoloration is when a <a href="http://www.8liners.com/datatech/yoke02.jpg" class="postlink">yoke</a> was physically knocked out of alignment.  Otherwise, discoloration that the internal degaussing coil couldn't fix could be resolved with an external, stronger, one.  That said, I don't think we ever tried to intentionally damage a CRT with a super-strong magnet.

CRTs are scary, but not as scary as they are often made to sound, especially not at such a small size. He'll be fine.
