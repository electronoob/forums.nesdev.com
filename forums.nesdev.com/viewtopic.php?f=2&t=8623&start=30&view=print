<br />Whoooho this means my PC is not a "clone".
<br />
<br />That being said it's still VERY MUCH different from the start of the PC standard in the 80s, and much more similar to a modern PC from another copany.
<br />
<br />On the other hand NESes can't be upgraded (OK one could put some 8k RAM instead of 2k, then what ?) and Nintendo stopping producing them so the comparison doesn't make any sense.

<br />The company sells chips, not devices. So one could build their own console if they wanted to.

<br />
<br />Whoever they are, if they have business good for them. But none of those famiclones are systems that accept NES or Famicom carts, despite being a clone NES system. That means while there may be more clones in other countries, they're NOT NES or Famicom systems, they're an NES core with everything else different.

<br />We must not be thinking of the same systems. I thought that parts of the Middle East (and elsewhere, like India) still had lots of pirated Famicom carts being sold. Presumably one can buy systems also.
<br />
<br />Of course, this is all hearsay on my part. I haven't seen it myself. Also things may have changed in the years since the accounts I've read where written.

<br />
<br />I get the same way but it's more driven by my lack-of-interest in the uber-realism 3D worlds that took over.  I don't know if it's age-related...I just have a hard time keeping track of things [where did I leave my horse again, dammit...]  Much easier to remember the extra life is in the block next to the third pipe.  Also, the early days of 3D were plagued with z-order bugs that just drove me nuts...cameras going behind walls, etc.  Perhaps it's better now--or perhaps the number of vertices has approached a limit so visually stunning, and gameplay has become so fast-and-furious that these bugs are less noticed.  Or perhaps better algorithms came along.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I blame it on the idea that developers don't know what a <em>game</em> is and how it's different from a <em>movie</em>. I also blame it on modern gamers because they'll eat this crap up, which spurs publishers to only want more of it, so developers wind up needing to take the indie approach in order to make something different, where the indie community is also full of novices and generally gets a bad rap for low production values, at least on the 360.
<br />
<br />I think gaming (as we knew it, at least) died the moment DLC and achievements became commonplace.
<br />
<br />This is also why I tend to stick with Nintendo; they don't do this crap. Sure, they may rerelease 20 year old games over and over, but at least those were <em>good</em> games.

<br />Z order was broken on the Jaguar, 3DO, Saturn, and the original PlayStation, which would always sort entire polygons. N64 and every sixth- and seventh-generation console, on the other hand, have a depth buffer or "Z buffer" that in effect sorts individual pixels, fixing the most common Z-order bugs. As for cameras getting stuck behind walls, engine programmers have learned to <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatedAngle" class="postlink">cheat</a> those angles by manipulating the near clipping plane. Super Mario 64 was over a decade ago, and Nintendo is up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy_2" class="postlink">Super Mario 67</a> now.
