		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is just a curiosity rather than a project, but I figure this would be a great place to get input from programmers on the feasibility.  That and it could sort of be seen as a response to Tepples' comment about 'if I have an idea for an NES game, write up a design document and share it', but this contains no ideas, rather a question.<br /><br />As the title might imply, this thread will basically ask if it would be at all possible to create the best NES game the hardware can allow, and the best game a programmer's own limits allow.  Most games released for the NES during it's heyday were made by a team of professionals, usually an average of 6 people.  Some games were made by bigger teams (most commonly Nintendo's own games), some games were made with tiny teams (Battle City was allegedly ported by three people), and some games were made by one person (Super Turrican).  Additionally, some games did not receive a great budget, and some games were made without any approval or pay from the publisher, such as Mega Man 2.  So obviously, the 'best' game would not be entirely possible by one person, much less one who isn't being paid anything.  Rather, a team of hobbyist programmers would be needed, and they would need to be paid.  This leads us to the first two questions of my post; what is the ideal size of a development team, and how big would the budget be?  This just covers the development, advertising would be another question entirely.<br /><br />Secondly (even though it's the third question, I know), would the NES' hardware pose a limit in how 'good' a game could be?  The most commonly cited flaw of the NES would be the scanline limit of 8 sprites, with the NES' relative lack of horsepower being a close second; you can only do so much without extreme flicker or slowdown, and a game is not enjoyable if either of those problems are incredibly persistent.  There are tricks that could be done to hide flicker as much as possible, such as making a vertically oriented game (IE Star Soldier) as opposed to a horizontally oriented game (IE Gradius) to prevent the chances of sprites occupying the same scanline(s), in turn preventing flicker.  On a related note, I've made a topic addressing why slowdown was so common on the NES, and I've learned that it could be possible to optimize the programming in such a way to make it near nonexistent.<br /><br />Should this game push any technical innovations, or should it just be 'another' game that's rather derivative?  Some people have commented that Shovel Knight has animations that are 'too smooth' for an NES game, when the NES has had a few games (Moon Crystal) that had very fluid animations.  Should this hypothetical game push the aging hardware (or create proprietary cartridge hardware) even more than professionals have been able to, assuming there's anywhere left to go?<br /><br />Finally, how can this game be marketed?  I've noticed that some faux-retro games feature appearances from celebrity composers, possibly to get fans of their work to buy said game.  But I think that wouldn't be helpful, especially since this is (primarily) targeted at a VERY niche market.  That and it adds a huge price tag to the overall budget.  I was also thinking that this game could be given to certain YouTube celebrities such as the AVGN or Game Grumps to bring this game's attention to the mainstream public, increasing sales potential.  Of course, the NES game will be targeting a niche market, so I was thinking about also releasing a version for a digital distribution service such as Steam or Nintendo's eShop, which will further increase sales and revenue.  Speaking of the devil, would Nintendo have any objections to a plan like this?  I've read that they weren't exactly accepting of Grand Theftendo, as it was once C&amp;D.  When it became Retro City Rampage, Nintendo only offered him a license to publish the game in exchange of him removing his NES development documentation.  Would there be any way to bribe Nintendo, such as by buying a 'license' from them, or would we have to avoid them entirely?  If the latter, would there be any legal issues regarding a game, made for Nintendo hardware, being available on competitor's stores?<br /><br />As you might've guessed, I don't have the money, but if I did I would fund it.  So this thread could be used for future reference, if anyone crazy enough was willing to invest almost a million dollars for a miniature return for such a trivial concept.  Thank you for reading, and I hope this sparks some interesting discussion.

There is just advantages and inconvenients.<br /><br />The advantage of a team of 1 person is that there is no communication problems or fight between members of the team, and there is no risk of having an important member leave on anger. However, if the sole member is uninspired, he cannot count on anyone else to help him with ideas, and if he looses interest in the project for a while, the project is frozen. It also takes longer to develop the project.<br /><br />As for the budget, this makes no sense, since we're hobbyist we're doing this for free by definition. However, you will have to pay for the material to build the games (cases, PCB, ROMs, ROM programmer, artist to design labels etc...) and this, in low quantity, certainly costs high enough to make a single game pak cost largely enough. If you want to pay the programmers for their effort, this will make the cost too high and not enough will buy the game.<br />Of course I'm assuming no profit in all cases.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Secondly (even though it's the third question, I know), would the NES' hardware pose a limit in how 'good' a game could be? </div><br />Simple answer - it does not.

For example, those Koei simulator sucks pretty much, but they use the MMC5, the best mapper made by Nintendo. However, there is amazing games with just use NROM (no mapper). However, there is also amazing games that uses advanced mapper, and shitty game that uses no mappers. There is really no correlation in my opinion, all cases are possible.

The NES, like most computers, is very general purpose and can be programmed to do just about anything. Its limitations aren't much of a guide to the form of a game, at least not on the high level. There's not enough there to suggest a form.<br /><br />When you get to lower level decisions, the platform you're one certainly does have a say, for instance, as I make my game, the 4-palette limitation is having a huge influence on what creatures I put together, or what tiles I can use in a room. The NES is certainly shaping the details of my game as I run against its limitations, but the high level design has almost nothing to do with the NES. Sure, it helps to go in with an idea of how the platform works and what it can do, but I really doubt it will be the source of inspiration for a great game.<br /><br />Gimmick isn't about the NES, it's about platform jumping, star riding, responsive enemies, secret rooms, etc.<br /><br />Startropics is about grid-based action, finding invisible switches, a repeating rhythm of exploration-dungeon-boss, a tropical island theme, etc.<br /><br />These games were made for the NES, but on a high level the same ideas could have worked on any game platform (well, maybe not the Magnavox Odyssey).

The Sega Master System has the exact same sprite limitations of the NES (64 sprites total, 8 per scanline), and games like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat draw the fighters entirely on the background, but since each tile can have 16 colors instead of just 4, those games can get away with simplifying the backgrounds instead of completely eliminating them.<br /><br />I believe that you should keep the overall limitations of the target platform while designing a game, but only think of precise implementation details later. You will probably have to make some compromises, but that happens during the development of any game. Some planned features are always abandoned/modified during the development of any game, so it's perfectly normal that this happens with the NES as well.

Some of these things are merely hard (e.g. 2 player), and some are more or less impossible (horizontal split screen), but in the space of what's possible I don't think it offers much constraint at all to suggest a high level form. If I said &quot;make a game, but you can't use the colour red&quot;, would this be a stimulating source of ideas for games? What if I just said &quot;you can use red, but it will be difficult&quot;?

The NES' limitations will have a huge impact on how you implement it speficially, but on a high level it's not off the table.<br /><br />Columns' play field is 6 x 16 pixels wide. You could easily get 9 different colours on the playfield, it just wouldn't be as pretty as you could do it on other systems, but this is exactly what I mean by details. How pretty something will be isn't what I would refer to as &quot;high level&quot;, though I do realize this is an arbitrary term with very fuzzy boundaries.<br /><br />Dr. Mario could have had more species if the playfield was 16x16 tiles, perhaps horizontal even. The game could have worked with more species, but 3 was convenient. It could easily have been 6 species with an inverted colour scheme (black on the inside with colour outside), or some other way.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">zzo38 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Well, actually I guess you could say <em>Attribute Zone</em> is a game based on the NES/Famicom PPU; there the limitations are precisely what suggests the form (and &quot;high-level design&quot;) of the game.</div><br />Yes, you can get some ideas by considering something that matches some facet of the platform exactly, yes. It's worth considering ideas like this for sure, and you may come up with some interesting ones, but what I am saying is that probably not a very good source of direction on how to make &quot;the best possible NES game&quot;.<br /><br />Actually, this seems kind of funny, since there are plenty of old games that are highly dependent on some very technical implementation. Something like Pole Position / Hang On / Rad Racer is based on a scanline scrolling technique, for example. I tend to think the way these tend to come about is from the opposite approach. You don't ask &quot;what can I do with per-scanline scrolling&quot;, you ask &quot;can I make a road with perspective&quot; and then think about how you might do it. Maybe you can think of a way, and maybe you can't, but ask yourself a bunch of these ideas, and sooner or later you think of a way to make it work, and that's the idea you go with.<br /><br />What I am saying is that I think you'll get more by bringing outside ideas and seeing how they might interact with the limitations, than you would be trying to come up ideas that begin and end within the limitations. If you find the latter fruitful, though, by all means use those ideas. I just think it's a less productive approach (for me, at least), and probably shouldn't be the primary approach when looking for game ideas in this context.

To clear up one thing, this was about a hypothetical NES game, a game that would hopefully aim to be as good of a game as possible, also hoping to match or even supersede professionally made NES games.  But that's one of the questions, would a game's quality determine it's popularity?  Most faux-retro games are popular thanks to either being derivative of popular NES games (such as Shovel Knight being a Duck Tales and Zelda 2 mix at heart) or have homages to popular culture and other NES games (such as the entirety of Retro City Rampage), so maybe those faux retro games could serve as a guideline for 'what people want'.  They also seem to represent 'how people remember NES games', which is quite literally the definition of rose tinted glasses; NES had some solid titles, but most games were mediocre and very few were actually 'advanced' like modern games.  This hypothetical NES game should strive to emulate all of the good aspects of the NES' library, maybe even exaggerate how NES games actually were by having the music being stereotypical bleep-and-bloop music with constant arpeggios.<br /><br />That said, I'm not too surprised on how some NES games came to be because of hardware limitations.  Dr. Mario looks like it was built around the NES' limitations, as I believe Tepples implied that the playfield was sprite-rendered, which explains why it's so small.  And as someone else once said, limitation breeds creativity, so the NES limitations could be more or less game guidelines; you aren't going to fill the screen up with random objects as this would not only cause significant flicker and slowdown, it just wouldn't be good design.

Dr. Mario's playfield is entirely 8x8 background, except the currently moving pill. All he was saying is that three colours is convenient for doing it in 8x8 background tiles, because that's the size of a palette (3 colours + background) and you can only have one palette per 16x16 region, so unless you group things into 16x16 blocks you can't make arbitrary combinations beyond 3 colours. As I said, using 16x16 tiles would easily have let Dr. Mario work with more colours.<br /><br />If you want to see for yourself what is in a game's background, open FCEUX, go to Debug &gt; Name table viewer (this is probably the best way to start getting a sense of how NES graphics work).

Grid-aligned 16x16 tiles do let you pick any possible background color palette...  Unless you're referring to the monochrome game boy.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />True, <em>Magic Jewelry</em> and <em>Mystic Pillars</em> clone <em>Columns</em> for Genesis, which uses 16x16 pixel tiles. Its 6x12 or 6x13 tile playfield is about the same size as that of <em>Puyo Puyo</em> or <em>Pac-Attack</em> or <em>Puzzle League</em> or <em>Wario's Woods</em> or <em>Puzzle Fighter II</em>. But <em>Columns</em> for Game Gear has a taller playfield that won't fit in the NES picture without using a scanline-counting IRQ to cut off the bottom 4 scanlines of each 16x16 pixel tile like the bottom half of <em>Klax</em>. (<em>Columns Crown</em> and <em>Puyo Pop</em> and <em>Luminesweeper</em> for GBA use a similar technique using the GBA's HDMA to allow 12 rows.) <em>Columns III</em> for Genesis has a 5-player mode that uses 8x8 pixel tiles, and an NES clone of that using a Four Score would have to find some way to represent more than 3 species with 3 hardware colors.

Every NES game ever released was made as good as possible from the possibilities of it's creator(s).<br /><br />I doubt many people made games that sucked on purpose... Even games that really suck like Action 52 were probably made by totally incompetent people with ridiculous deadlines and bad communication among the team so that's while the result is disastrous. But I don't see a company do something like, &quot;ok, we could make this game perfect, but we'll introduce flaws in it in order to give other games a chance&quot;.<br /><br />There is not one perfection, but multiple ones. Also, every one has different tastes about games. Personally there's quite a few NES games which are already &quot;perfect&quot; in my opinion.
