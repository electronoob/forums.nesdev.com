(Basically, the graphics just need to work on real hardware.) Also, It is preferred if you try to use the 15bit color space, but it isn't the end of the world if you don't because in terms of color fidelity, it doesn't look too far off from 24 bit color.<br /><br />Here's some artwork of a space-cloud thing I did.

Mine look a little too much like popcorn.<br /><br />By the way, I like how are of our graphics use completely different art styles, with psychopathicteen's looking a bit anime, mikejmoffitt's kind of reminding me of indie games that are supposed to look like old games (I've found that a lot of them don't really shade their sprites that much and almost look like 16-bit renditions of early NES games), and mine, which I'm trying (but failing) to give a somewhat serious tone but still making it a bit &quot;cartoony&quot;.

I guess in some circumstances people may refer to it as pillow shading, though that is only really a problem when the light source isn't well established or is dead center on the object.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you! I personally think I'm a better artist than a programmer, but unfortunately, I like programing more than drawing. The problem I have with programming is that I'm too scared to write anything too inefficient, as I usually somewhat know how to do something but always ask for help to see if I'm doing it correctly. I'm also crazy about how my art looks, as I usually always try to make something look better but usually just end up messing it up. (I had to force myself to upload this to stop myself from working on it.) I'm a bit concerned about how long it would take me to draw whole levels (I don't really like repetitive tiles and would probably replace some every time the screen scrolled) if it took me about three days just to draw that.

I'm trying not to make the explosion too dark, because it is going to be the first frame.<br /><br />Edit: I got a cool idea to make BG3 look better if anyone wants to hear (It probably wont be worth it though, because it will take up about 1/4 of vram!) I was thinking you could use a 256x512 tile map and have every 8 tiles downwards have a different color palette. You would then use HDMA to change the y scrolling position to have the second line on the screen be the eighth on the tile map and the 3rd to be the 16th and so on. Eventually, the tile map would run out 32 pixels down the screen and at this point, you would use HDMA to change the tile map parameters to display a new tile map and you would set the y position to 0 again.
