<br />I can't seem to buy a PAL Megaman 5 or 6 NES Cart (rare as hens teeth), so i was planning on making one, all i need is the image, oh and the right cart too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i finally found the pin outs for the 2mbit flashes i have, and the Winbond w49f002u has pin 1 as a reset pin, the document i have explains that when the reset pin is at high state, the device is in normal mode, but when it is at low state, it will halt the device
<br />What im trying to say is, do i gnd this pin or attach it to the supply voltage or not connect it at all? 
<br />
<br />On all other flashes ive used pin 1 is NC not connected.

<br />Looks like you answered your own question.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /> 
<br />I would attach it to the supply voltage.

		<td><b>TL-Rom Cart for Megaman 5</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ive got three questions for anyone who has done a TL-Rom dev cart,
<br />
<br />1.When using low voltage flashes (5volt) do you attach the WE pin to the supply voltage or to GND? On Eproms this pin is attached to supply voltage, but in the case of a flash, won't this enable the write cycle if you do that?
<br />SO should i just keep the pin floating?
<br />
<br />2.When rewiring up the CHR ROM Flash i have noticed on the documents on this site for the pin outs of 2MBit CHR ROM state that pin 31 is CHR/A13 (CE), does this mean it is A13 and also CE at the same time? and also where do you wire this pin to then? (there is already a CHR A13 which is pin 28 )
<br />
<br />3.When i wired up the socket for the PRG, i followed pin 1 (A17), its track goes on the underside of the board, under the MMC3b chip on the underside of it, to a hole in the circuit board with no solder in it, should i put a blob there to join that track to the other side?(if it isn't already)
<br />as i assume this joins to pin 23 on the MMC3 chip??
<br />
<br />Maybe if someone sent me the rewiring instructions for a TL-Rom dev cart i can compare to what i have done so far, as i don't really want to stuff this up, not that nes carts are terribly expensive to buy these days, its just the headache of going through this over and over until i get it right.
<br />
<br />I really would like to play megaman 5 on the real NES and not emulator, it has the real feel about it.
<br />
<br />Any help would be appreciated. thanks all who have had input so far.

<br />Definitely you should connect it to +5V. I never saw any positive enable write pin in my life (but again to not be flamed I must say there could be rare exeptions, definitely not on standard flash roms).
<br />
<br />2:
<br />Yes, CE is A13 at the same time, because your CHRROM is enabled on the PPU bus for adresses $0000-$1fff (pattern table fetches) and disabled for adresses $2000-$3fff (name&amp;attribute table fetches).
<br />A13 of your EPROM should go to the MMC3 pin of the same name, as this pin in NOT directly used by the PPU, but by the MMC3's bankswitching circuit. It's a little confusing, that's why on the wiki we call "PPU A13" the A13 line on the PPU's adress bus and "CHR A13" the pin from the mapper to the memory chip.
<br />
<br />3 :
<br />I'm not sure what you meant here. It's very probable that pins goes on the bottom side on the board, then trough the board to connect to the MMC3 from the inside. You should test them with an ohm-meter. There is plenty instructions for TLROM rewiring available arround.
