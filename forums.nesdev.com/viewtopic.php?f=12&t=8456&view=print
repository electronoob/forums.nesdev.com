I suppose it's from d4s as there would be no way of manufacturing such a big cart back then but the post wasn't really stating what it was or where it came from... It's impressive none the less! From the video it look like it's smoother than FMV on Sega Saturn <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /> Now we wait until someone solder 56 piggy-backed 27c801 EPROM into a cart and try to pass it as a very rare prototype! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />
<br />
<br />Edit: I just realized the post is by d4s himself lol. So I guess I'm asking you directly but after downloading the game and noticing it's 560Mb, I guess I answered my own question <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> Somebody's feeling stupid right now <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

<br />
<br />That would be interesting. =)
<br />Thought about a MSU1-less version with HDMA audio streaming and just a big, fat ROM plus custom mapper, too.
<br />FlashROM is dirt-cheap nowadays (<a href="http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/MT29F8G08ABABAWP:B%20TR/557-1491-2-ND/2747268" class="postlink">~$20 for an 8Gbit chip on digikey</a>), so it's a possibility.
<br />I would certainly love to see a couple of cartridges made of this game, just for the heck of it.
<br />I mailed bunnyboy concerning that, but he didn't even deem it necessary to answer my mail, whatever...  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />

<br />Maybe you can PM him at the NA forum if he's still around there. He did publish Shiru's xmas game for the SNES after all, so I don't think he's unwilling to publish yours unless he considered it too much work due to the custom solution.

<br />Raw NAND, like the part you linked, requires the mapper to do error correction. SD, on the other hand, has a controller IC to handle this error correction for you and make it appear as a standard block device. So if you can <a href="http://alumni.cs.ucr.edu/~amitra/sdcard/Additional/sdcard_appnote_foust.pdf" class="postlink">implement an SPI-based SD interface</a> in your custom mapper, you could solder an SD or microSD card onto the board and get cheap big flash that way. I see <a href="http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=1+gb+sd+card&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=0Ec&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&amp;biw=1123&amp;bih=871&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=10568207118668335231&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0Tv7TvPhBZKJ2AWB_LWKDg&amp;ved=0CPwBEPMCMAc" class="postlink">8 Gbit for $2</a>.

Every time I had to e-mail him on RetroZone he would take week to reply. I received a powerpak with a dozen tiny hole in the label and considering the price I paid for it was looking for a replacement label at least, e-mailed him on september 27, got a reply on november 8 and none since then.
<br />
<br />About the cart, I know about sd2snes, I just didn't know some prototypes were out in the wild. I am waiting for the time they get released, I guess being able to try Road Blaster on it will be one more reason to get one. Stillo pretty awesome to see something like that running on the snes, I remember playing Space Ace and Dragon Lair's on my friend PC back in the 1990 and trust me, it didn't look anything like your port of Road Blaster! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />
