You'll usually end up emulating at (262*341-.5)/3*60 = 1.787 MHz, slightly slower than the console's CPU speed, but nobody except people trying to synchronize multiple systems (e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QsG0D-MLp4" class="postlink">platformer racing</a> or musical performance) will care.

VSync, can modern monitors reliably be expected to be able to do 60 HZ (~exactly that that is - I realize they'll probably be able to do more)? Also, windowed mode might be an issue I guess, unless you can specify the refresh rate for the entire desktop. My emulator is Linux-only at the moment btw, though I'll probably port it later.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The NTSC NES PPU produces 60.10 fields per second. Some monitors used with desktop PCs run at 60.00 Hz, others at 59.94 Hz. Laptop monitors may have stranger timings. Some CRTs ran at 75-100 Hz to reduce flicker. And some onboard sound chipsets are known to play slower or faster than the requested rate, such as my PC at work. YouTube syncs everything to audio, but it can get away with it because videos are 12-30 fps, not 60.

Have a video-based emulation loop and vary the audio playback frequency to match the video rate.<br /><br />I've developed a technique that results in near-perfect synchronization of the two playback rates -- video stays locked to vsync (assuming a ~60Hz refresh rate), and audio playback frequency, once synced up, varies by as little as .01% (just a couple of Hz).  One of these days, I'll post some code.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">ulfalizer wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">can modern monitors reliably be expected to be able to do 60 HZ (~exactly</div><br />Is the hardware capable of it?  Probably.  But there are a lot of other factors (drivers, scheduler latency, etc.) that will prevent your app from being able to sync to an exact rate.

With that lib, one approach would be to add deltas at time points <em>fudge*t_1, fudge*t_2, ...</em> instead of at time points <em>t_1, t_2, ...</em> I guess. You could then increase <em>fudge</em> when the buffer seems to be running out, and decrease it when it seems to be growing. Hopefully you would &quot;steer in&quot; on good values quickly and have unnoticeable fluctuations.

I currently measure the average fill level and regularly fudge the resample rate using a simple linear formula, <em>&lt;sample rate&gt; = &lt;desired sample rate&gt;*(1 + C*(&lt;desired fill level&gt; - &lt;current fill level&gt;))</em>, where the constant C determines how aggressive the adjustments are and the desired fill level determines the internal latency. That way I can usually stay within 0.4% of the desired sample rate on my setup (SDL on Linux, which prolly goes ALSA wrapper-&gt;PulseAudio-&gt;ALSA or something icky like that).<br /><br />I'm sure it could be improved though. Maybe using square formulae would be better. Any recommendations from James or other people?<br /><br />Edit: Read through the thread again and saw blargg mentioning direction. Maybe getting deltas in there would allow it to steer in smoother on the target fill level...
