		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, I have been playing around a bit with Visual 2c02 to figure out timing and behavior for OAM-addr and encountered something that seems strange to me. <br /><br />From the information on the wiki:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> It is also the case that if OAMADDR is not less than eight when rendering starts, the eight bytes starting at OAMADDR &amp; 0xF8 are copied to the first eight bytes of OAM; </div><br /><br />This does not entirely match the behavior that i observe in Visual 2c02, the behavior is almost the same but instead of copying the 8 bytes starting at OAMADDR &amp; 0xF8 to OAM[0-7] the destination is instead OAM[0x20-0x27], so it is offset by 0x20 bytes. <br /><br />No matter where OAMADDR is pointing at start of rendering the destination is always 0x20-0x27. It also seems that all 8 bytes are copied within one cycle, if rendering is active the bytes are copied at the first cycle of the pre-render line, and if pre-render has already started the same clock as rendering is turned on in register $2001.<br /><br />Has anybody else observed this? It seems strange to med that OAM[0x20-0x27] would always be overwritten. Since if one would write 0x00 to $2003, then transfer all sprites using DMA, the bytes in 0x20-0x27 would become duplicates of 0x00-0x07. Maybe something is wrong in the simulator causing the destination address to become offset by 0x20 bytes incorrectly?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The OAM copying happens due to <strong>analog behavior</strong> in the original silicon, specifically DRAM voltage decay. Since Visual2C02 is a purely digital simulation, it will never be able to replicate that sort of thing perfectly.<br /><br />The fact that it's resetting anything at all is due to pure luck; the fact that it's going to the wrong column means it's probably just a timing glitch which I may or may not be able to fix.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, I guess that asserting two different rows in the dram close enough in time allows charges to be passed from the first row to the second. <br />Looking at the schematics the dram is organized in 32 rows and 8 columns for OAM (plus 1 column for secondary OAM). <br />If the active row(the one OAM points to) is refreshed every clock cycle, and the row is changed very close to the end of the refresh cycle the charges left in the lines should be able to pass over to the now active line.<br /><br />I did some more testing in Visual 2c02, now looking at the lines activating the rows, and it seems at the start of rendering, the active row which OAMADDR points to is cleared before it would normally and the address line to the row where 0x20-0x27 is present is activated for what remains of the cycle.<br /><br />After that secondary OAM clear starts (although not writing anything since it is the prerender line), also offset to the same row as 0x20-0x27 so OAM2 clear starts at byte 4 instead of 0.<br /><br />Isn't it possible that this is not a timing related issue, but some logic error in the simulator setting the address line to row 4 instead of 0 at the start of rendering? Since it always seems to be the case in the simulator that OAM2 starts to clear at byte 4 instead of 0 on the pre-render line.<br /><br />Anyway, the simulator is awesome. Really helps for figuring out detailed behavior for my emulator development.
