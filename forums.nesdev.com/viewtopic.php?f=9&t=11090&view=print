		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was hoping anyone here could help me out.  I have been using my NES with &quot;fake&quot; stereo audio for awhile now and wanted to add the Famicom expansion audio as well.  I've been having a lot of trouble, most likely due to the fact that I have pin 1 &amp; 2 running through a potentiometer, to mix the sound (I actually prefer that it's about 50% stereo, not all the way).  No matter what I try, I can't get the Famicom expansion audio to sound right:  It's always distorted and fuzzy.  Here's what I've tried:<br /><br />- I tried an ENIO board, which routes the Famicom expansion audio through the stock mono output.  That sounds perfect, so there's probably nothing wrong with my NES or Everdrive. (FYI: the ENIO was removed for the rest of these tests)<br /><br />- I tried connecting the expansion audio pin (pin 9) directly to a pot and into a headphone jack.  This way, I was able to test only the expansion audio (I used Akumajou Densetsu).  I was able to tweak the pot so the expansion audio sounded perfect (about 1.3k, according to my multi-meter)<br /><br />- No matter what I try, I can't get it to sound good when mixed into one channel of the stereo mod.  I tried many resistors, from 330 ohm all the way to 44k ohm.  I tried connecting it directly to the audio output jack, to the pot and even to the pins on the motherboard (pin 2 is where it should mix into).  I even tried running it through it's own pot again, to make sure the pot for the stereo mod didn't mess with the resistance of the expansion audio...that changed the volume, but it was still very distorted. <br /><br />Has anyone been able to successfully do this?  My end goal is to have pin 1 and 2 about 50% separated, with Famicom expansion audio routed through the same channel as pin 2.  I'm open to other solutions, if there's a better way to do this.<br /><br />Thanks again for anyone's help.

Schematics would be ideal, but I understand they're a lot more effort. (Feel free to start with <a href="http://nesdev.com/NESAudio.gif" class="postlink">this schematic of what the stock frontloader uses</a>, if it's helpful)<br /><br />A few years ago I provided <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=72984#p72984" class="postlink">this schematic</a> for someone who wanted to downmix the three NES channels to stereo for recording purposes; he said it worked well for him.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hm. <br /><br />So currently, you're using the potentiometer to control stereo separation by connecting L and R together with an adjustable resistance. But you also say you're pretty happy with a fixed amount of separation, and I've seen some insinuation that a -3dB (½) volume pan is &quot;best&quot;.<br /><br />So assuming that your computer speakers can deal with a 2k input impedence, try this after removing your original potentiometer:<br />You'll need three 3.3kΩ resistors, and three 6.8kΩ resistors. You can probably go as low as 1k and 2k; higher numbers should work too, but are in greater danger of the amplifier receiving the signal poorly (often tinny, but sometimes just too quiet). You probably want the ratio to stay around 1:2.<br /><br />Connect one 3.3k and one 6.8k resistor to each of: 2A03 pin 1, 2A03 pin 2, and the expansion audio pin. Connect the other end of those resistors such that two 3.3k and one 6.8k come to one point, and one 3.3k and two 6.8k go to the other. Connect these two junctions to your TRS connector.<br /><br />This is actually the same as the <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=72984#p72984" class="postlink">one I posted a few back</a>, but with fixed panning.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks very much for the advice, I'll definitely give that a try.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, is there an easy way to make it adjustable?  Maybe two pots:  One pot for stereo mix and another for expansion audio volume control.  Either that, or one of those pots like my guitar amp has, where it's two-in-one: pull out for one control, push in for another?<br /><br />If not, no big deal, I'm sure your diagram will work nicely.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, for the &quot;way-too-much-control&quot; version, try this:<br /><br />For each of the three outputs, you'll need a 1k resistor, a 10kΩ, linear taper (we'll use it for panning), and a 100kΩ &quot;audio&quot; or &quot;log&quot; taper (for volume control).<br /><br />Connect the 1k resistor to the output. To that, connect one outer leg of the audio taper potentiometer. Connect the center pin of the audio taper pot to the center pin of the linear pot.<br /><br />Be careful; the audio taper potentiometer has an orientation: you want to make sure that as you turn the potentiometer it seems to get louder in a continuous sense rather than very gradually followed by very rapidly. If you have it backwards, switch which outside pin you're using.<br /> <br />After you've done that for all three inputs, tie each side of all three panning pots together (producing &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;). Connect those into your speakers.<br /><br /><br />After you've determined the right set point for any of the channels, you can replace them with equivalent fixed resistors.
