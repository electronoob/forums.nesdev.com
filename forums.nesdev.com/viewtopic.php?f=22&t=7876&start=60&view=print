<br />The AND #$03 clears all bits but the lowest 2, which means that the possible values for the result are:
<br />
<br />%00000000 (decimal 0) (no button pressed on either controller)
<br />%00000001 (decimal 1) (pressed on controller 1, not pressed on controller 3)
<br />%00000010 (decimal 2) (not pressed on controller 1, pressed on controller 3)
<br />%00000011 (decimal 3) (pressed on both controller)
<br />
<br />The CMP instruction is a subtraction, if the result of the subtraction is positive the carry will be set. Since we're subtracting 1, the only way the result will be negative is when the value is 0, i.e. no button is pressed on either controller. In the other 3 cases the carry will be set, accurately reflecting the fact that the button is pressed on at least one of the controllers..

<br />And qbradq don't post some nonsense code like that. There is no way any of it will ever work. You need to write 1-&gt;0 to $4016, and read it 8 times, there is no way arround that.
<br />DON'T EVER use RMW instructions on registers.
<br />The only faster thing you can do is do it in an unrolled loop.

<br />
<br />I think you're being a little harsh there. I didn't say that was a complete example. That's just the reading loop. And I didn't use a Read Modify Write instruction on a register. The only instruction that touches a register is LDA.

<br />I forgot about that when I suggested something like that for a faster controller reading routine, didn't think about it, but yeah don't use them, like me. And that code is pretty dumb truthfully. And using X to store the value 1 then 0 to 4016 is used by stuff and isn't widely used, I wish that was noted somewhere, instead of just using A and losing a whole 1 byte, heh. Just kidding, but it seems worth the gain when you're strapped for ROM. Although there's probably many more ways to go around with this stuff, in the mean time lets post them all and figure out another topic to blow up! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> lol

<br />
<br />Cooshinator: GFX and Music
<br />
<br />Time to restart, pay attention to every detail, and try that controller read loop and stuff you guys recommend highly <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Forget it, I just was in a very bad mood the other day because of a stupid physics exam.
<br />
<br />For some reason I thought controller_state was some hardware resister but of course it's not. That's what I like to use plain register adress so that you can immediately see it's a register and avoid the confusion (and I'm dumb too). Also if you really inist on using a label instead of using $4016, it's a good idea to make the label all in caps which is commonly used for constants.
<br />
<br />So yeah if you replace the and #$89 by and #$03 I think this will actually work. Although I'm not sure it's faster to tepples' solution (which happens to also be my solution). So yeah the AND mask should be different.

I found a tutorial for putting tiles in the background, but i figured you should be able to set a background color.</div>
<br />When background tiles use color 0, no matter the palette, the background color is displayed (color 0 of the first background palette). For sprites, the transparent color is always color 0. You can't even set an actual color for it when writing the palette, there is no internal memory to hold that information. Actually, if you try to set those colors, they'll be written to the corresponding places in the <span style="text-decoration: underline">background</span> palette, overwriting whatever you wrote there previously.
<br />
<br />Also, note that even though there is physical memory to hold a different color 0 for each background palette, the one that always gets displayed is the one in the first palette. The others are never displayed during normal rendering.
