		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've got a gameboy cartridge connector attached to an arduino and I'm having some problems. I can get the game's name from 0x0134 and read up to 0x4000, but I can't switch banks or read RAM.
<br />
<br />I think my problem is that I'm not understanding the documents about the MBCs. They are all from the point of view of a gameboy and I don't know what addresses are gameboy specific ports.
<br />
<br />On some MBC1 games, if I read from 0x4000 I get garbage. If I write anything to 0x2000 and then read 0x4000, I get data from 0x#C000. The most significant part of the address changes from game to game.
<br />
<br />I know it's not easy to debug from that. So, if someone could give me non-gameboy specific instructions I could at least rule some things out.
<br />
<br />Thanks a lot.

<br />
<br />If Mode is 0, $0000 shifted left 5 places combines with what you write to $2000 for the ROM Bank that appears at $4000 - $7FFF. If Mode is 1, just $2000 is used for ROM Bank and $4000 selects a Cartridge RAM Bank.
<br />
<br />Hope that helps. Oh one more thing, MBC1 cannot select Bank 0 to appear at $4000-$7FFF. If you try, it will effectively be changed to show Bank 1 the second bank in rom.

<br />
<br />I tried writing all 256 values to 0x2000 after setting 4/32 mode, but I never read different data. On a 128K game I should read new data multiple times right? Assuming they didn't repeat things at different addresses. 
<br />
<br />Maybe I just swapped some address lines or something.

<br />
<br />I would definitely double check your wiring. Although if MBC3/MBC5 carts read back fine I'm not sure.

<br />
<br />I have played and saved multiple games to it. So the RAM isn't blank.
<br />
<br />I've written 0x01 to 0x6000; 0x00 to 0x4000 and 0x0A to 0x0000. 
<br />I set WR=1, RD=0, CS=0 then I read from 0xA000 to 0xBFFF. With pull up resistors I get all 0xFF. Without I get long strings of the same few numbers.
<br />This same process works perfectly for addresses 0x0000-0x3FFF. 
<br />
<br />What am I missing?

<br />
<br />Looks like the sequence for reading the SRAM is:
<br />
<br />Ram Enable: write 0A to 0000
<br />
<br />And that's probably all you need to do to enable the SRAM.
<br />I don't think you need to do 6000 = 01 or 4000 = 00, because you aren't switching the 8K ram page to something else, so you'd just see mirrors of the same ram regardless of what page is selected.  But selecting page 0 shouldn't hurt either.
<br />
<br />But that's also exactly what you did.  So I have no clue why it's not working.  What clock speed are you accessing the RAM at?

<br />
<br />The clock speed of the arduino board is 16MHz but I don't have a way to count cycles as it's in pseudo-C. 
<br />I scattered in some 1 micro second delays and put two 10 microsecond delays in the write loop. I know that's probably orders of magnitude more time than it needs but I wanted to be sure. You can't run too slowly can you?
