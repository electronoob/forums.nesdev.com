		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's another week, do you know what that means boys and girls? That's right, it's time for another of QBRADQ's inane mapper discussions <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />This time I'm trying to create a super UOROM board again, but this time I have an eye to emulator compatibility as well. I have implemented some of the features of the Bandai mapper (iNES #16) in discrete logic, specifically 16-KB PRG-ROM banking, fixed bank, WRAM and 4-mode mirroring select (H, V, 1A, 1B).
<br />
<br />I think I'll actually try to build this one into a dev cart. I've been itching to do a discrete logic project, and this seems like a good one.
<br />
<br />Here is the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/qbradq/hardware/ines-mapper-16-subset-in-discreet-logic" class="postlink">project page</a> which includes the combinational logic equations, theory of opperation, the schematic in PNG and Eschema formats and other <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lis.inpg.fr%2Frealise_au_lis%2Fkicad%2F&amp;ei=LLzuTYWnA6TL0QGm0qnfAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGapVOOPuqXt9o6SrbWl5WyZg62RA" class="postlink">KiCad</a> support files. The archive also contains a preliminary <a href="http://code.google.com/p/diy-layout-creator/" class="postlink">DIY Layout Creator</a> file for the perfboard prototype. I've only found this program today so I'm not quite sure how this will turn out.
<br />
<br />I am looking for some advice on how to connect the mapper board to the NES. My first thought was to take an NROM board, desolder the components (other than the CIC), solder wires to the pins I need, then solder those into a 60-pin ribbon cable header. I would connect that to the mapper board via a 60-pin ribbon cable. That takes care of the cart connector, and I can reuse it latter for other boards.
<br />
<br />What other approaches have you all seen to get prototype boards connected to the cartridge slot (other than a custom PCB)?

<br />
<br />Very interesting to implement the mirroring register with a decoder with latch (137) and a bus driver (125) instead of a latch (161/373) and a mux (153). What advantage does it have?
<br />
<br />As the 6264 goes out of production, a 62256 with two address lines tied high might be the only replacement. It has no CS2, only an active low CS1. As I understand it, a 74x20 can decode this, replacing the 74x08. So can a 74x139, especially if you're worried about preventing spurious writes caused by M2-to-/PRG CE delay.
<br />
<br />Might you need pull-ups on the output of the 373? Or are the outputs pulled up internally when in high-Z state?

I think I am going to go in a slightly different direction though. I've decided to cannibalize that Ultima Exodus cart I've been threatening for years. I'll leave the PRG-RAM and CHR-RAM in place on the cart and route the PRG-RAM enable signal from my mapper board. This reduces the amount of wiring I have to do by quite a bit, and I don't have to use any of my own RAMs.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Very interesting to implement the mirroring register with a decoder with latch (137) and a bus driver (125) instead of a latch (161/373) and a mux (153).

Now if I didn't want to keep this thing compatible with mapper 16 I could use the high two bits of the latch I already have to drive it.<br /><br />I am not entirely sure how to use a 161 as a latch.

<br />Yea, I've been nervous about this. In <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7583" class="postlink">another thread</a> kyuusaku suggests that the ROM address pins will float high when unconnected. However everything I can find online suggests that this is a very weak condition and is very susceptible to noise. I'll go ahead and add in those pull-up resistors. It's better than an OR gate in my opinion <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />A <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/74161" class="postlink">74x161 binary counter</a> has an internal 4-bit latch.
<br /><ul><li>While /Clear is low, 0 is copied to an internal latch. </li><li>When Clock rises while /Load is low, D0-D3 are copied to this latch. </li><li>When Clock rises while Count and CarryIn are high, the latch's value is increased by 1. </li><li>If the value in the latch is 1111 and CarryIn is high, CarryOut is high; otherwise it is low. This allows cascading multiple 161s to make a bigger counter. I seem to remember some pirate boards (or was it NES-EVENT?) using a bank of 161s for its IRQ timer. </li></ul>
<br />CNROM, CPROM, GNROM, U*ROM, and A*ROM use this as a latch and never enable counting.
<br />
<br />Take UOROM for example. D0-D3 of the 161 go to CPU data lines, and Q0-Q3 go through a 74x32 quad OR gate (value OR A14) to upper address lines of the ROM. I think R/W goes to /Load, and PRG /CE goes to Clock, or something like that; can someone confirm how these are wired?

<br />
<br />In most designs registers are more appropriate than latches, the time to use latches is the rare case where their transparency will save you from replicating registers to meet timing requirements. (The '161 is a "latch" only in the data-holding metaphoric sense, it's implemented via a register because latches can't implement counters without multiple clock phases.)
<br />
<br />I'd replace the '373 with a '374 (register). Doing that will also allow you to replace the OR and NOT gates with a '139 decoder. I would also connect D5 since there's no harm in supporting 8M ROMs, they're package compatible with 4M. Emulators probably implement the higher bits too even if the real deal doesn't have them.
<br />
<br />I'm quite sure you really don't need the pull-ups, but put in a SIP bussed resistor network and try it out unpopulated at first.
<br />
<br />The '137 and '125 is clever, but the '137 is rare, I've never even heard of it. I see it's obtainable, but I'd go with a regular register, such as the ultra common '74. I came up with this which will let you keep the '125 if you use a '74:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://img810.imageshack.us/img810/5681/mux.gif">http://img810.imageshack.us/img810/5681/mux.gif</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />I think the '125 might be more elegant than a '153 if it turns out to be more available. Neither are extremely common, but the '125 has a smaller package, every gate is used and I think it might be cheaper on average.
<br />
<br />Are you sure the mirroring bits are correct? It looks backwards to me so I have it wired like other mappers.
<br />
<br />Oh lastly it would be a good idea to use one of the PRG register bits to enable/disable the WRAM by its CE2 unless you're going to put in a battery controller.
<br />
<br />Lastly lastly, I assume you're opposed to working with PALs, but this design would be a perfect candidate. All the logic fits into a '374 and 16L8 with two functions to spare (they can implement decoded latches).

<br />
<br />What I am trying to accomplish with this initial design is to get a working development cart, and then port my current project over to it as a proof of concept.
<br />
<br />Obviously for replication a CPLD or similar would be in order. I am not terribly worried about that right now. For now I am just focusing on the bench model.
<br />
<br />Now I'm trying to hack in a boot ROM and making the Flash ROM writable <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />How can you tell if a logic chip is "common"? And how exactly does that impact my project?

<br />I've had some very good ideas with this project though. I may just do an MMC1 dev cart with a USB interface and a boot ROM. The only reason I picked mapper 16 was that it is easier to implement with logic ICs.

All the original mappers I've done put them at $5xxx.  But if you must have emulator compatibility, it should be possible to put a mapper/flash select register somewhere, to select where writes to $8000+ are going.
<br />
<br />CopyNES does that through one of the expansion port pins, that's how my UNROM Flash cart was writable (and I suppose the "PowerPak lite" also).  But it's a bummer to not be able to have the NES program by itself able to write to it.

<br />I use <a href="http://findchips.com/" class="postlink">http://findchips.com/</a> and just make sure it's available at several major distributors.  Good way to see the pricing and quantity in stock too.  Of course, it only matters if you want to put it into production, if you're just making a few of them for fun then you can use whatever you want (in that case, I have some AX5202P MMC3 clones in DIP-40 package, if you're interested in wiring it up - but I don't think they're real suitable for a large production run).
