Right now I'm just clocking the counter every 8th A12 transition and the status bars in games are very shaky and always start too early, sometimes the tiles alternate between frames and often the status bars crawl up and down the screen as the screen scrolls. I know there's more to scanline counting than A12 but what? Artoh's MMC3 has some strange Phi2 thing he's come up with, surely that's not how the actual MMC3 does it? What other mappers have scanline counters?
<br />
<br />I don't think I'll have any problems with any Phi2 counting mappers so I'll work on Konami ones next, they shouldn't take very long at all.
<br />
<br />Also anyone feel free to post mappers to this thread :)

<br />Is it that you need help drafting an appropriate copyleft style license that would protect the interests of the homebrew scene? Or is it that they are out of jurisdiction for you to sue them to enforce the license?

<br />Or is there more to it than I realize?
<br />
<br />Anyway I don’t think they would since they can make more money selling cheap to produce current system modchip clones for a huge markup, witch there is also a much larger market for. So NES development is relatively safe from shady profiteers
<br />
<br />Anyway2 good luck to all those working on things for this project I apprecate all your hard work.

<br />The hardware design can be cloned but the software is copyrighted. In theory they couldn't take all bunnyboy's provided binary files and use them in their product. They could however legally modify schematics to create their own product which may be drastically different but use the same underlying logic and still be legal. The most time consuming part of the Powerpak is surely the mapper design and it takes a lot of NES knowledge expertise to pull off, something that cloners likely don't have. Free schematics would be a very valueable time savers to them, I think it could be the difference between cloning and not.
<br />
<br />Free schematics might also contribute to other pirate products with a higher level of integration like a NoaC with .nes playback (think Kevtris' console). That could be very profitable seeing how well Famiclones sell in the retrogaming circles. I wouldn't want to contribute to a pirate company since if anyone deserves to profit from that, it's Kevtris seeing how he cracked much of the hardware in the first place.

<br />The mapper files particularly would be non-issue since they can just call them "third party" software witch they "had nothing to do with releasing"
<br />
<br />It would be difficult to nail them even for outright open copying with them located in china behind a disposable company name plenty of big name companies cant do anything about the counterfeits witch appear one guy would not stand a chance
<br />
<br />without the scematics I belive they would be able to use the mapper files to configure a FPGA from a differint sorce outher than a CF card although as cheapley as those famiclones are produced (witch still usually contain copyrighted code in there current forum) I dout they could have the hardware for something witch works well for outher than mapper 0 games witch would still need expenceive flashroms, RAM and so on so...... not to mention development work nessasery I dont think they would do it.
<br />
<br />One example of a fairly large western company witch uses work around tactics would be datel for example witch recently made a USB version of the Wii serial drive tool witch has a  "third party" wiinja dump runing on it, witch contains a modified version of the Wii's property drive code

<br />They could configure the FPGA without schematics but they couldn't configure another more attainable modern FPGA (than a 10 year old Spartan 2), without schematics since a configuration file is only good for a specific FPGA model wired in a particular way.
<br />
<br />Also if they came up with a modern NoaC, the ASIC could house all the needed resources including the mappers on the die making it very cheap to produce.

<br />I understand the concern about pirate companies making a profit off of scene work, I had also worried about that in the past.  I resolved it in my head by comparing it to the GPL license, and how a lot of people wanted to add restrictions to it so it could not be used for military purposes.  I imagine there are a lot of Linux kernel hackers who aren't crazy about their code being used in bombs.  But Richard Stallman insisted on no such restrictions - and ultimately I think he's right.  What's important is that the information is out there, and in a usable legal form.  The fact that someone will take it and do things you don't agree with (maybe even illegal and/or rotten things) sucks, but that's the price you have to pay.  If that doesn't sit well with you, then you probably should not release your work.  I don't want some far east company stealing my work and making a profit off of it, but I'd rather have my work be relevant and helpful.
<br />
<br />on topic:
<br />I'm going to get started on some mappers, just need to figure out which one would be best to start with.  I don't want to pick one somebody else is working on, and I don't want some crazy obscure mapper that has no games I'm familiar with.  When I have something, expect it posted here - schematic and all.

<br />Heres a tip (something that got me confused at first):
<br />
<br />"CIRAM" A10 and A11 are the same as CHR-RAM's A10 and A11. If you don't want to use bunnyboy's mirroring symbol or want direct access to "CIRAM" A10, you need to put a multiplexer on it. Select = A13, D0 = CHR-RAM A10, D1 = CIRAM A10.
<br />
<br />Personally I made a mapper symbol which provides a blank slate interface to bunnyboy's mapper schematic using all the connector pins for I/O, I find it easier to work with since I'm familiar with the net names.
