Somebody did tell me in another thread that around 5% of ROMs actually use it but I find that number to be unlikely. Since it is frankly impossibru to hunt down every NES ROM on every hard drive in the world and update it I have chosen not to implement it. If you need to determine which board a certain mapper uses either do a CRC check or get the user to pick a board (which is what WedNESday does).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think you should implement it even if you can't find a single ROM that uses it. I mean, even if you had 200 ROM to test with, I'd expect very few of them to use the more troublesome configurations, so you'd still be mostly in the dark. Even if you can't properly test it, your emulator will have higher chances of running an iNES 2.0 ROM successfully if you did something about it then if you chose to ignore it.<br /><br />I haven't done much NES programming lately, and haven't really released any finished ROMs, but everything I do uses iNES 2.0. I expect most homebrews to use it as well, so even if nobody goes in a quest of converting and re-releasing all the old commercial ROMs, the number of iNES 2.0 ROMs out there will keep increasing.<br /><br />It's such a simple thing to do, I don't know why anyone would choose not to implement it.

So, a CRC check would help to fix the mapper number and/or the NES header flags properly <em>for that broken game.</em> I do this in RockNES for a few games with incorrect settings in the header. There's a pseudo-hack of F-1 Race: the guy just changed the mirroring in the header to make the game hud be &quot;transparent&quot;, but the road is glitchy.<br /><br />Regarding NES 2.0 header format, it's good a few files for testing the loading &amp; parse the header info. No matter about the small amount of files floating: there's also a good amount of DiskDude corrupted headers.

Maybe you also look at the filename, but then you make it likely to not correct a ROM which has been renamed slightly. Also, appeal to authority fallacy; even if Nestopia does it, it's still a hack.

There is <em>still</em> a non-zero chance of collision. And that doesn't even address the fact that making a small patch to the ROM would suddenly break it with no clear evidence as to why. The emulator hid the fact that you had a corrupt dump, and then when you made an innocent patch it decided to stop covering for it being corrupt. Given that there are ways to avoid the gamble, why make it in the first place? It's like throwing <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">if &#40; rand&#40;&#41; == 1234 &#41; corrupt_header&#40;&#41;;</tt> into your ROM-loading code.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">WedNESday wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">16384 NES ROMs in the GoodNES set (apparently).

You'd make a minor change, then it would totally bug out, and you'd wonder what the hell. You undo the change and it works fine.
