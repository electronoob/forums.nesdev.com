		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is is possible to put games from the Famicom Disc System onto the NES so that you can play the FDS game on an NES?
<br />
<br />Remember that most FDS games require you to "switch disc sides", so my guess is that if it is possible, you'll have to perform some kind of ROM hacking to put the sides together (since NES can't switch disc sides).  
<br />
<br />I'm not going to try this, I'm just curious.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you can build an NES cart with RAM at $6000-$DFFF, an 8 KB ROM at $E000-$FFFF, and a CPLD to generate interrupts and control a NAND flash (e.g. CF or SD) mapped somewhere in the $4100-$5FFF area, then you can replace the BIOS that loads from the FDS disk with a BIOS that loads from your NAND flash. Save each "side" as a separate .fds file, and you can now play FDS games on your NES, but minus the sound.
<br />
<br />Or you can use an FDS RAM cart and the FDS Loader cable connected to a PC.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Your best option if you want to put FDS games on a cart is to mod a Romance Of The Three Kingdoms 2 cart I think. That one has 32kb of CPU-RAM, and you can configure the MMC5 so that $6000-$BFFF are RAM and $E000-$FFFF is one of the 8kB ROM pages. For most games then, the job would just consist of writing an alternate BIOS. Of course, you also need to replace the CHR-ROM on the ROTTK2 board with CHR-RAM.
<br />
<br />But like tepples mentioned, you'd still miss out on the sound, which makes the effort not worth it IMO.

<br />A bit of romhacking is needed, but that would probabily not be impossible.

<br />I certainly don't speak for this community, but in my opinion this kind of reply is not welcome.  We certainly enjoy humor around here, but this is neither funny nor helpful.  The poster asked a legitimate question about a topic most non-experts would not know much about.  We welcome questions of all levels like that here, and responses like this are not very friendly to newcomers.
<br />Or maybe it's really funny, and I just don't get it:)

<br />Ahhh ok Teaguecl.   Your reply is not welcome to my reply then.  Sorry ya broke your funny bone when you was littler.  
<br />
<br />And instead of "nor helpful" and adding your reply to this post, why not just send a PM?  duh.
