That would allow the game to be freely distributed and even sold as a physical cart by anyone that cared to, but would not allow modification of the game.<br /><br />Obviously this isn't the way to go if you're concerned about making a profit off the game.<br /><br />Assuming that your primary goal is getting your work out there and in a physical media, what problems do you all see with this approach?

I'd say it should be one of those where you can release the ROM, but just make sure nobody makes carts for anybody until you've had your fair chance at providing them for the people who want your game. After that, if somebody wants a copy, sure anyone can make it. I don't want anybody NOT playing my game because I have no more copies, but definitely want to be the first to distribute. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Release the ROM as Non-Derivative, Non-Commercial at first, then once you think you're done making and selling carts, re-license the ROM as CC-BY-ND, or even lift the Non-Derivative clause if you wanted to.<br /><br />I may do that if I ever bring a game to market. Thanks 3gen!

The thing is that the license won't stop people who won't care about licenses much (repro makers), and you won't do a thing about this, because it will cost a lot of money and time for you without any gain. On the other side, restrictive licenses could stop creative people to do something that you didn't even imagine.

This is one of the purposes of Free software licenses.

The Tivo thing was a fluke and still took over a decade for somebody to figure it out.<br /><br />The viral thing probably is good for things like full projects where you really don't want other people to make anything with it without playing by the same rules. For things like libraries that are meant to be used as part of other programs it's probably better to be more permissive to not impose your own license onto other people, though then one could argue that anything more restrictive than the zlib license is a bad idea for those... It all depends on how you expect it to be used.<br /><br />Also worth noting that the GPL isn't the only viral license. Pretty much anything with a NDA attached to it is going to be viral, since you can't do anything with the code at all without being given explicit permission by the NDA.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">qbradq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Not NES dev, that's for sure <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> If you're wanting to get into the industry you can apply for jobs at established development houses.

Yes, of course knowing modern technologies is important, but since it's a moving target it's probably more important being able to easily adapt to new technologies as you stumble upon them.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Not the easiest thing to do,  but one way to deter repromakers (depending on their hacking skills) is create your own mapper or use an obscure mapper.  Then when you stopped caring you could port it to a common mapper to more easily allow people/repromakers to make/publish your game if desired.<br /><br />That might not even really be that necessary though.  Perhaps merely publishing the game is enough.  I mean, how many repromakers do you see with bootlegs of battlekid?<br />They could make them easily, but don't.  Perhaps it's because they don't think they can compete with retrozone or because they know they'd have a lot of haters...  I doubt it's because of legalities/licenses because that's not stopping them with everything else they produce.  I guess they might see retrozone more likely to press charges than Nintendo/other copyright holders who knows.
