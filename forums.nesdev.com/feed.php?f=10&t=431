I've got all of that covered. I can comment out any bit of code in the reset loop and the problem goes away. Must be taking to long. But what I don't understand is, "Why the graphical errors if the NMI occurs during the middle of the reset loop/ the reset loop takes longer then the time from the end of the last NMI to the begining of the next?". I don't use the same zero page data in the reset and nmi parts. Drawing buffers will only occur if the proper flag is set. <br /><br />It has to be the slowness of the last bit of code I added to the reset loop. Finally tipped the scales as far as how much time I could use, but like I said, why the graphical errors (name table, attribute table, horizontal rows flickering)?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=153">mbrenaman</a> — Sun Jul 24, 2005 1:08 pm</p><hr />

Be especially carefull with your variables/buffers.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Jul 24, 2005 10:05 am</p><hr />

Try splitting your game logic over two frames. Run it at 30fps or less until you can isolate what's taking so much time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Jul 24, 2005 9:10 am</p><hr />

Well, I'm back with another problem. When I add more code to my reset part of game loop (were I thought actual game logic went), I get screen garbage.<br /><br />So I'll tell you how I thought the game loop was supposed to go.<br /><br />- init everything<br />1. Wait for the begining and end of the NMI<br />2. Do game logic.<br />3. Loop to 1<br /><br />Everything works great until I add more clock cycles to step 2. Then I get screen garbage. <br /><br />I do the normal wait for vblank in step one. Then I have a flag tell me when the NMI routine is over.<br /><br />Obviously, I'm doing something wrong and I don't understand why this is happening. I thought the kind of screen garbage I was getting only happened if the NMI was to long and I started screwing with $2006 outside of the vblank period.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=153">mbrenaman</a> — Sun Jul 24, 2005 8:37 am</p><hr />
