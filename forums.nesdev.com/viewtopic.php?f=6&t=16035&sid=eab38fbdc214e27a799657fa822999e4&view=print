You, too, can become a part of NES music history!<br /><br />Due to the sudden unexpected timing, Famicompo Pico 3 will last for two months! FCP 3 starts on the 15th of June and ends on the 7th of August before midnight UTC.<br /><br />The four categories are original, cover, freestyle original and freestyle cover.<br /><br />Original and cover entries must be submitted in NSF format. All expansions are permitted.<br /><br />Freestyle entries must be submitted in MP3. The 2A03 must be noticable in the song. Simulation and signal processing are allowed.<br /><br />Winning entrants in the originals category under 64KB (2A03-only) will be put on a special FCP3 cartridge playable on any NES, or a Famicom with an adapter. One cart will be awarded to the winner of each category! More details will be available by August 1st!<br /><br />Come join us on <a href="http://webchat.esper.net/?nick=..........&amp;channels=fcpico3&amp;prompt=1" class="postlink">#fcpico3</a> on EsperNet IRC or on our <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/5x6vdSK" class="postlink">Discord server</a> for more info, and visit us on our website at <a href="http://famitracker.org/fcp3/" class="postlink">http://famitracker.org/fcp3/</a>!<br /><br />We'll see you there!

MP3 is simply more accessible and nearly all devices nowadays would support, such as playing from a USB stick inserted into a cheap/old Hi-fi and into one's digital TV set, and (obviously) MP3 players. Newer formats may not be supported and these devices may not even have an option to have their firmware upgraded (either not upgradeable or that there is no longer any <em>new</em> upgrades).<br /><br />If the files are supposed to be listened by say, someone behind a PC, then Opus is an okay choice.
