My Vizio VX32L, for example, produces a distorted picture when I play PlayStation games on my slim PS2 or <em>Mega Man X Collection</em> on my Wii unless I switch to the composite cable.

I mean, back when I bought it certainly wasn't priced as if there was something special about it. I never connected any consoles through the composite inputs though, only my old DVD player.

Digital TVs like LCDs were coming out and had Component, and cheaper CRT TVs tended to be lucky to have S-Video much less Component. Component was probably more common on more expensive/larger TV sets.

At least I don't think they're rare...<br /><br />Anyways, ya, i don't see why a line doubler couldn't be put into the CPLD.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Quite a bit bigger CPLD is needed for a line buffer solution, the SRAM could hold a line for double scan but the CPLD needs whole lot more IO to get the extra addressing capability, there's likely more complexities involved (sharing RAM between palette and line doubler section).<br /><br />As for component intputs on a CRT, I have never seen one such locally. I have seen lots of VGA connectors however (and of course SCART which practically everything has in this corner of the world).

We have one, but we haven't tried it with 240p though.<br /><br />That's awesome it can do S-Video as well though! The captured picture looks great (well, as good as one can look from a $10 capture device), and it's nice to see something with zero jail bars. I'd love to add this to my toploader.

Many 27&quot; and up TVs have component here, and I got this one for $10 from a thrift shop.
