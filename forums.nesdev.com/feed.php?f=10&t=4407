This has been argued on forums since time immemorial. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I'm pretty certain X was never supposed to signify ten, considering we have X-2 instead of XI or eleven.  It signifies a split in the series rather than a sequel.  This is further confirmed by the fact that 9 does not segue into X in any way.  Theoretically there could be a Megaman 10 and it would make perfect sense.  In fact I hope they do that, to put to rest the talk about X being ten.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3438">UncleSporky</a> — Mon Aug 10, 2009 6:20 pm</p><hr />

Yes, tepples won't miss you, and he's completely right, I guess 'X' originally meant number 10, altough it may as well be the name of the main character (which is a different robot that the original Mega Man as I understand things, it only looks similar).<br />And there is 8 Mega Man X games out there (altough the last 2 for the PS2 in 3D aren't very good). I guess Capcom discontinued the series, now it's the RPG series Mega Man Star Force which is going on (and they're really good).<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />You're tempting me to test MMC5 and learn more about it now  But since I don't plan to remake the game, I should wait when I really need it.<br /></div><br />It's by far the best mapper ever made you should get your hand on a MMC5 doccument.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Since I'm trying to reproduce the intro + 1 level, I guess I'm not taking a risk yet.

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I'm sure someone out there has both .<br /></div><br />That's not the problem. There is plenty of people who are Mega Man fans here and that knowns programming well. It's just that doing such a thing without Capcom's authorisation is completely illegal, so probably it will take a while before someone takes the risk of doing it (don't count on me). I'm confident that this will happen eventually.<br /><br />EDIT : Now I've watched through all stages (8 robot masters and 4 wily stages), and I admit it sounds very doable on a NES. Sure, there is some still images in cutscenes that have too much colors, and some places that would flicker. However, with minor color reduction and slight graphics changes, almost everything could be done on the real NES with a normal cartridge easily.<br />The only exeption is that boss battle with a red core and a green core. First the cores seems to use MUCH more than 3 colors for their graphics (this can be easily scaled down). Second, there is a point where they move vertically, and are both on the same horizontal line. The only way this could be done is by making one a sprite and the other a BG, but due to their large size, as a previous guy already said, it would take almost all 64 sprites on its own. So the only real solution, without changing their attack pattern, is to use MMC5's vertical split mode (in SL mode) that only one space shooter ever used yet.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Aug 09, 2009 12:08 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, that's what I meant.  I consider Somari "homebrew" because it was never official and used characters/setting without license.  I do know it's quite old by now (c. 1994 according to the game) but it's been spread across the web since then.<br /><br />Mario in a Sonic game?!  You'd think it'd set the world on fire.

If I had to pick someone that only knew one of those things, I'd pick the one that has programmed a game (or at least confidently knows he can) than the one that knows just 6502. The 6502 is very simple, and there are tons of references about it, any competent programmer will pick up on it quickly. The PPU is another big issue. Understanding how it works is also much more important than knowing 6502.<br /><br />I'm not saying the person you found knows or doesn't know things, I'm just expressing my opinions on what the priorities are.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Aug 07, 2009 6:38 pm</p><hr />
