It's probably only a little harder. <br /><br />A lot of neat things you seen in modern games are unusual in NES games, just because no one had thought of them. I don't think it usually had much to do with how difficult they would have been.<br /><br />For instance, compare Nintendo's version of Tetris  with LJ65 by Tepples. LJ65 contains a lot of neat gameplay mechanics that weren't impossible on NES. They just hadn't been thought of yet. <br /><br />See also: The evolution of Megaman games. Megaman 3 added the slide attack, Megaman 4 added the charge shot. Every earlier Megaman game probably could have had these techniques (they probably weren't too tough to add), but they just hadn't been thought of yet.<br /><br />But if I as a homebrew developer wanted to make a game like Megaman, I wouldn't have to think of these things because they have been in another game. So I could add them straight away.<br /><br />Another thing in a lot of older NES games is using select to pick the modes. It is more intuitive now to use up+down on the d-pad, but no one had done that yet!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Sun Dec 18, 2011 4:37 pm</p><hr />

Like Shiru said, there doesn't seem to be anything about this game online, so it will be hard to make an actual analysis. What you described sounds a lot like SMB1 though... When you press start at the title screen, there's a black screen that shows how many lives you got before the gameplay starts, but there's no such screen between the title and the demo, so the title screen does become the level.<br /><br />If that's the kind of thing you're talking about, there are no special tricks involved. The level engine could run right from the start, rendering the first scene immediately, and then "pause" the game and modify the screen slightly so that it becomes the title screen. Once start is pressed, gameplay resumes. This is the most straightforward way I can think of to accomplish this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Dec 18, 2011 12:08 pm</p><hr />

No game dump seems to be available for public, not even a video, so it is going to be diffucult to answer to your question.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Sun Dec 18, 2011 11:13 am</p><hr />

I just got myself a powerpak and i use it the most for playing prototypes and testing homebrew.<br />1 of the games 1 played is kitty's catch a game that was made by a gametek/tengen programmer in his free time.<br />That he tried to sell but it never got sold.<br />ANYWAY..<br /><br />The starting screen baffled me.<br />The push start screen transforms in the playing screen.<br />Something i have never seen before in nes games.<br /><br />How do you call this technik? Is it a 1 screen game or is it in fact multiple screens?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3558">log in</a> — Sun Dec 18, 2011 11:04 am</p><hr />
