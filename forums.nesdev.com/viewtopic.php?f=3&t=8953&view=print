		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been working on a NES emulator for the past week, and I'm at the point where it's running a bunch of stuff perfectly fine and failing spectacularly when it comes to other things, which unfortunately means that I have trouble telling exactly what is wrong right now.
<br />
<br />As far as the first two issues go, I think they're related, but I'm not familiar enough with what opcodes FF1 uses to wait for scanlines when it displays the dialogue box. In FF1, the dialogue box comes short a few pixels, so I'm adding cycles somewhere where I shouldn't.
<br /><img src="http://www.mybals.se/ff1_1.jpg" alt="Image" /> <img src="http://www.mybals.se/bolymp.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />(As for Battle of Olympus, it'll keep flickering back and forth between those two when on a certain spot of the stairs, as well as when you talk to people in the game. Whenever you're just walking on flat ground or fighting stuff though, it works fine.)
<br />
<br />The second issue is this:
<br /><img src="http://www.mybals.se/ff1_2.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />The first column of the background above the player character sprites is misaligned for some reason, and while I'm pretty sure it isn't because of VRAM mirroring, I'm also not sure what might be.
<br />
<br />My third issue is with Castlevania:
<br /><img src="http://www.mybals.se/cvania.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />For some reason, it ends up loading the wrong sprite data after the title screen. Most stuff, but not all, is garbled. Is there something about the VRAM address register I've got wrong? (A lot of other mapper 2 games work perfectly fine, such as Contra, Megaman and G&amp;G.)
<br />
<br />FF2 also locks up right as the first battle is about to start, like this:
<br /><img src="http://www.mybals.se/ff2.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />This might be related to one of the previous bugs, but I know I had it running a bit further (with the wrong graphics) and then crashing when selecting something from the menu. (Not sure what was changed between then and when it stopped working, sadly, FF2 wasn't the game I tested the most often.)

<br />Yes. Load <a href="http://nickmass.com/images/nestest.nes" class="postlink">this ROM</a>, JSR $C000, and compare PC, CYC, A, X, Y, P, and S before each instruction. CYC is in units of PPU dots, advances by three units for every CPU cycle, and is reported mod 341. Bits 5 and 4 of P don't matter because they don't exist in the CPU. The nice thing about nestest is that you can rely on it even if your PPU isn't correct (or even if you don't have a PPU at all).

<br />I've been around, just not on IRC in as many channels as I used to.
<br />I tried running Blargg's official.nes in Nintendulator (I haven't implemented the undocumented opcodes yet) and clicked the "Start Log" button before I hit "Run", but I honestly can't find where it outputs the log, haha.
<br />
<br />I just saw your reply before I posted mine, Tepples, I'll check it out!
<br />(Still can't find the log Nintendulator outputs, though.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks! I finished analyzing the log for nestest.nes, and I noticed that I had the branch additional cycles thing wrong edit: *for branches, not for everything. I'm small and sleepy.*, I forgot to increment the PC by 2 (opcode+operand) before checking for crossing a page boundary, and I had my zeropage AND off by one cycle as well, other than that they were identical. Going to give Blargg's official.nes a shot and go through that... which will probably take a while. :)

Due to a miniscule difference between when Nintendulator and myself set the VBlank flag, it's rather impossible to check for difference between opcodes past the first test. Blargg, is there any way to do the tests without VBlank interfering with the test results, like in kevtris' nestest.nes?

<br />Earlier I logged Castlevania from startup to title screen, and I was comparing my log to the one from Nintendulator, and everything matched up quite peachy until NMI hit. This showed up in the Nintendulator log:

<br />Why does the Nintendulator PPU suddenly jump ahead 5 scanlines in the middle of NMI? I tried looking for info on the Wiki, but I couldn't find anything to the effect of this, though I might've been looking in the wrong places. (I just had it explained to me that it's sprite DMA! Raah!)

<br />
<br />At this point I'm kind of left wondering if the graphics failing to load in Zelda 1/2, Castlevania are really because of timing issues...? It does seem to be decently accurate at the moment, though it's certainly not perfect.
<br />
<br />Edit: Fixed FF2. I had at some point messed up the check on write to $2002 to see if the nametable tile index had changed.
<br />Edit 2: Fixed Castlevania and Zelda as well, I was handling 8x16 sprites incorrectly! Woo!
