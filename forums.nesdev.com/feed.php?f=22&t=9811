From what you say it seems that HDCP is the worse feature of OUYA, and that is probably correct; HDCP is the worse feature of many things (so is HDMI; someone suggested a VGA output and that probably would be a better idea (although better than VGA and HDMI, I think, is my own &quot;Digi-RGB&quot; design, which is sufficiently simple but nothing supports yet; if you want remote control and video/audio combined cable then you use also what I have made called &quot;Digi-RGB-Plua&quot;)). It is Android system and they say is open source and standard screws, so maybe it is possible to remove HDCP (at least for some software; doing so might cause other software to stop working if it explicitly uses the HDCP features of the graphics chip).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4734">zzo38</a> — Wed Aug 14, 2013 3:09 pm</p><hr />

Sorry guys. Sony says the terms of the contract are non-negotiable - even after climbing the ladder and talking directly to Adam Boyes who is the head of the indie department. I can't in good conscience support a console company whose motives are questionable. They seem extremely anti-indie friendly the moment you step out of the PR and into reality. Their contract has many statements of varying 800 pound gorilla tactics severity, and I simply can't put my company and ultimately my family at risk for the sake of EMUya. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />All Next Gen Materials, all inventions and developments that utilize or incorporate Next Gen Materials and any derivatives of Next Gen Materials are the sole property of SCEA<br /></div><br /><br />That means that anything we ship on the PS4 Sony owns (including your games maybe even).

As far as I can tell, you still may be able to do something which isn't normally allowed by the Ouya contract as long as the program isn't distributed on Ouya, for example if it is on PDROMS. Of course this may not be suitable for many purposes, but it exists in case someone does need to do that, for example if someone makes some open-source NES/Famicom emulator for Ouya that can load external ROM images, it may be distributed on something else and the user will need to know how to install external software (although I believe documentation for doing this is provided, although it is probably more difficult than installing official software anyways, but I suppose that's OK).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4734">zzo38</a> — Mon Jul 22, 2013 10:04 am</p><hr />
