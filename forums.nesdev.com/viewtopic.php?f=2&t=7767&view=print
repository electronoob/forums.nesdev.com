<br />Still nonsense.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I'll explain what I mean by nonsense: a word on the 6502 is 16-bits.  Period.  Just because the accumulator and index registers are all 8-bit doesn't mean the 6502 term "word" means 8-bit.  It doesn't.  The Wikipedia article declares "Word Size" to refer to "Word Size of Architecture", which means absolutely jack squat.  It's like saying "snake size".
<br />
<br />Hey, do you know what the size of a snake is on the 6502?  It's 84.5200192 bits long.  Because, you know, snakes.  Do you refer to the PC on the 6502 as being "two 8-bit words", or even "two 8-bit bytes?"  Nobody does.  It's referred to as "a word", or "16-bit word", or "16 bits".
<br />
<br />Someone is trying to change what the term "word" means when it's 100% contextual based on processor.  That entire Wikipedia page should be nuked from the face of the planet.  Silly!

<br />
<br />The 6502 has a "word size" of 8 because it cannot operate on entities bigger than 8 bits.  In that sense "word size" is more reflective of the data bus width at the chip interface.  I agree the term "word size" is confusing/misleading/etc.  It's "address space" is 16-bit, not its "word size".
<br />
<br />And, if you look at diagrams [here I mean those found in hardware manual, etc.] of the 6502 the PC is indeed shown as two 8-bit constructs glued together.  In fact, almost all documentation I've seen on the 6502 treats them uniquely... PCH versus PCL.

It appears that "word" is not a fixed-size entity like "byte" is. The 6502 can manipulate at most 8 bits at a time, the only 16-bit values it deals with natively are addresses, not words (but even then, they're still handled as 2 8-bit numbers internally). Personally, I don't object to saying that the word size of a 6502 is 8 bits.

It is not the register size and it is not the address bus width. The word size has no impact whatsoever on a programmer and that might be why it means "jack squat" to some.
<br />
<br />In the case of a 6502 it is a pretty obvious fact that the word size is 8 bits. An architecture's word size must not be confused with the programming term "word", which does have an impact on programmers, and for legacy reasons has come to refer to a 16-bit word.
<br />
<br />The OP was simply explaining that he decided to stick to this same convention despite the fact that the 6502 has an 8-bit word size, which makes perfect sense.

<br />
<br />This is exactly how I saw it. A "word" always refers to 16-bits, but a processor's "word size" refers to the accumulator size, which varies.
<br />
<br />Though, what makes the 6502 an "8-bit" processor? Is it because the size of its data bus is 8 bits?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The "bit size" of a processor is about as relevant as it's clock speed. It is touted when convenient, inflated when lacking and generally meaningless.
<br />
<br />For instance, if we say that the 6502 is an 8-bit CPU because it's data bus is 8 bits long, then so must we say the 65C816 is an 8-bit CPU. It also has an 8-bit data bus (in that there are 8 wires running out of the die to the memory chip), but it uses (up to) 16-bit wide registers. Because it uses 16-bit registers we call it 16-bit.
<br />
<br />But then you have the Motorola 68000 series. It has an 8-bit data bus and 8-bit registers, yet supports 16-bit operations on groups of registers. Why do we not call it 16-bit?
<br />
<br />And what about the VR4300 (CPU in the N64)? Although it was based on a 64-bit MIPS architecture it's data bus was cut to 32-bit, but still supported 64-bit operations in a similar manor to the Motorola 68000. Yet it was called 64-bit.
<br />
<br />Bottom line is, it don't matter. A word is 16 bits. Deal  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

<br />
<br />Because of the accumulator and register size, I thought.  The data bus of the 65C816 is 8-bits, but it's definitely a 16-bit processor.  And "instruction word" on the PIC16 are 12 or 14 bits wide, yet it's an 8-bit processor (it's harvard architecture though, meaning the program memory is separate from the data memory).
<br />
<br />I'm not as familiar with Z80, but I know it as some kind of 16-bit operations.

<br />
<br />Generally I agree, but I would say: on the 6502, a word is 16 bits.  Meaning: "the term 'word' refers to something that's 16 bits in size".
<br />
<br />That's my entire point: it's utter nonsense to use the word "word" to describe common register sizes on a CPU.  As such, that Wikipedia page should die in a fire.  It's purely a terminology thing, absolutely, but anyone who has written assembly on a multitude of architectures knows exactly what "word" means with regards to that architecture.  That's why I preceded my statement in my above paragraph with "on the 6502...."
<br />
<br />Yes, I'm quite aware that non-6502 architectures may use the term "word" to describe a varying number of bits (16/32/64) depending on what operational mode it's in (think protected mode or x64).  But usually assembly programmers say "word" to mean 16 bits, "dword" to represent 32-bit, and "qword" to represent 64-bit.    Hey look, <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Windows_Programming/Handles_and_Data_Types#DWORD.2C_WORD.2C_BYTE" class="postlink">some other bastard</a> knows this too.  And anyone familiar with this god-awful architecture knows that if another engineer says "yeah blah blah, it's going to be a word, blah blah" and isn't precise in what he/she says, the response will always be "wait, when you say 'word' what exact size are you talking about here?" followed by a discussion that's reminiscent of   Of course, <a href="http://x86asm.net/articles/working-with-big-numbers-using-x86-instructions/" class="postlink">this guy</a> beautifully contradicts himself ("I use word to refer to 32-bits", then in his own assembly code uses DWORD because per Intel's architecture HE HAS TO.  <a href="http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/153784/da-derp-dee-derp-da-teetley-derpee-derpee-dumb" class="postlink">Derpdederp</a> alert).
<br />
<br />So to recap: the term "word" on 6502 refers to 16 bits.  But it may not matter much since <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-preacher-warns-end-of-the-world-is-nigh-21-may-around-6pm-to-be-precise-2254139.html" class="postlink">we're all dead this weekend</a>.
<br />
<br />I guess we could have a big discussion about what "byte" actually means too, since on <a href="http://dictionary.die.net/byte" class="postlink">some (ancient) architectures</a> (PDP) a byte is 6 or 7 bits.  And hey, did you know that in <a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/echeeve1/Ref/C%20for%20PIC/C_Intro.html" class="postlink">some PIC compilers</a> "int" is 16 bits?  Yeah, that makes for lots of fun, believe me.  *grunts*

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have to agree that 6502 words are 8-bit. It has nothing to do with the ALU, nor holding an address; a word is technically not tied to any specific number of bits, it's a generic type that for most processors will be the external data bus and/or instruction width. Memory devices are frequently expressed as n x n-bit words where the width isn't even necessarily a power of 2. Early DRAM came in 1-bit words, so it would take 8 words in parallel to form a sufficient data bus for the 6502. Ancient mini computers may have like 50-bit words, but perhaps only 32-bit can be used for data leaving 18-bits for dedicated instruction encoding. This scheme far predates the 8086 but also fits the 8086 which has a 16-bit bus; reading a DWORD or double word thus denotes two 16-bit memory fetches. (Despite the 8088 having an 8-bit bus, the programming model is identical so they kept the notation.)
