I've managed to wade through the sesspool of dependencies.  Soon I hope to school myself on package building so I'll have something to deliver.

<br />The debuggers are all in the IDE--which has its own emulator built in.  There's also a stand-alone version of the emulator without any debuggers.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />UPDATE: I've put together some Debian packages.  I've tested these in Linux Ubuntu 11.10.  However, I'm extremely new to the whole package management and distributing applications in Linux, so your mileage may vary.  I have no idea whether the packages will install on other Linux flavors.  Someday soon I'll create a VM with something other than Ubuntu and try it.
<br />
<br />There's three Debian packages on my <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nesicideproject/documents?pli=1" class="postlink">website</a>.
<br />
<br />First you'll need to download/install libnesicide-emulator_1.004-1_i386.deb.  This installs the NES emulator shared library that's used by NESICIDE and its companion stand-alone emulator.
<br />
<br />Then you'll need to download/install nesicide_1.014-1_i386.deb if you want the main IDE and/or nesicide-emulator_1.004-1_i386.deb if you want the stand-alone emulator.
<br />
<br />On a *clean* Ubuntu installation, I find I have to do:
<br />
<br />sudo apt-get -f install
<br />
<br />after trying to install either of the application packages.  That's because they depend on some Qt libraries that aren't installed.  dpkg doesn't automatically install dependencies, so you have to use apt-get to do it.
<br />
<br />When installing nesicide_1.014-1_i386.deb, after it's done it'll give you the steps to download/compile/install CC65 snapshot toolchain.  Do this if you don't already have it.  NESICIDE will still be able to load, play, and debug ROMs, but it won't be able to compile-and-run changes to ROM source without CC65 [I know this is probably obvious].
<br />
<br />I'm presently working on getting the example projects back online...I'll repost when they're available.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you try this and what your experience is.  I'm very interested in providing my tool in Linux!   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />What ROM are you trying to run?  It may be that it's a mapper that I don't support...if it's not in {0,1,2,3,4,5*,6,7,8,9,10,11} then it may not work.  *Support for MMC5 is not complete but is enough for some games to at least start.
<br />
<br />In the IDE is it obvious that the ROM is trying to execute?  In the Assembly Browser, for example, can you step instructions?

<br />
<br />If I do:

<br />that eventually concludes that I have an unmet dependency on libqtwebkit4.  Then, doing:

Thanks for the feedback!  I do notice some graphical artifacting in the emulator window, but not in the area where I'm actually rendering...it appears to be garbage in other memory being displayed outside of the 256x240 NES image.

This is distinctly a "my computer sucks too much". Although I'm a little surprised that QT didn't give you a simpler display render routine than GL...</div>
<br />Qt does provide QPainter drawing surfaces, but back when we were migrating to Qt [from Windows MFC+GDI], the decision to use OpenGL was beyond my realm of capability to formulate an argument against.  Words like "much faster", "more portable", "so easy" were too hard to argue against.  I wonder if I can add some GL tests to somehow "degrade" to "accomodate".  This is where my maddening lack of OpenGL skillz shines through!
<br />
<br />I'm *still* trying to figure out what method I should use of the bazillion that are available to render scaleable fonts for some of my visualizing debuggers.
<br />
<br />Might I also ask...how is the emulator, performance-wise [since you say your computer sucks?  On my Win7 lappy with Ubuntu in a VBox I get crap performance in Ubuntu, but great performance in Win7.  I'm going to go native Ubuntu at some point...just not ready yet.
<br />
<br />Really appreciate your feedback!

Athlon tbird/1333, Matrox G450, nesicide-emulator is somewhere around ⅓ real time. Worse when GL is enabled, maybe a factor of 2, but without an FPS meter anyway it's hard to tell how much. Without GL it's worse by an additional factor of four when inside the IDE? But really, this is all guesswork from the listening to the gaps between audio packets.
