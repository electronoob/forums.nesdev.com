		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I assume this is the section to post this thread at. I apologize if it isn't, since I'm pretty much new here. Anyways, I bought a reproduction cart of Gimmick! for my NES a while back (not from Timewalk or RetroUSB), and the cart runs on a INL-ROM board with the AY-3-8910 chip on the board. I also have a resistor installed in my NES for the expansion audio for Gimmick! The extra sound effects (charging the star, Yumetaro jumping) work properly, but the synth in the music doesn't work at all. I got a couple of pics of the board, if anyone wants to take a look:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/522zpca9ubo17i7/photo%201%20%281%29.JPG">https://www.dropbox.com/s/522zpca9ubo17 ... 281%29.JPG</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/175xdugffse2yj7/photo%202%20%281%29.JPG">https://www.dropbox.com/s/175xdugffse2y ... 281%29.JPG</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Does anyone know what the issue could be? If I need to get more pics or any audio from my NES, let me know.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If it's making the star sound effect, it sounds like it's mostly working already. Most of the SFX occur on the third channel of the 5B. Maybe one or both of the other channels isn't hooked up properly; the AY has 3 separate channel outputs, right?<br /><br />If you need reference for what channels are used by what music/sound, play the Gimmick NSF with NSFPlay with the Keyboard view open. It'll show you what's playing what.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I appreciate the help, guys. Sadly, I don't have access to an external audio amplifier at the moment, though I do have a question after seeing that pin layout that lidnariq linked: I took a look at pins 2 and 3 on the board (N.C. and ANALOG CHANNEL B), and they're not soldered onto the board. Well technically, only pins 1 and 4 are soldered to the board, in terms of the top row pins. But anyways, would it be wise to solder 2 and 3 to the board? Sorry if that seems like a dumb question. I'm pretty much new to this stuff XD

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yea, Channel B should be soldered; Pin 2, the NC doesn't matter. Looking at the photo, it kind of looks like Pin 22 is also not soldered (?). Thats the clock so if its not, solder it.<br />Yogi
