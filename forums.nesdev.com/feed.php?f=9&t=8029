Not this again.<br />I guess we already went multiple times to the conclusion there was absolutely no sense behind those names, and if there is any it's impossible for us to tell.<br /><br />I doubt there is any relation between the 'F' of Fire Emblem and FKROM, this is pure coincidence.<br />Even the game's codes does not make sense according to the game's name half of the time.<br />I mean NES-XU for Mega Man 3 ??<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Aug 07, 2011 5:40 am</p><hr />

Is there any method to the first character of board names? I know the first character specifies the mapper, and the second generally specifies the expected size of ROM or RAM. A few make a bit of sense: 'C' for CHR switch (CNROM or CPROM), 'P' for Punch-Out!!, and 'F' for Fire Emblem. But what about the rest?<br />'U' for 16 KiB PRG switch, 'B' for 32 KiB PRG switch, 'A' for 32 KiB PRG switch and 1-screen mirroring, 'S' for MMC1, 'T' for MMC3, 'E' for MMC5, 'H' for MMC6...<br /><br /><a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=711" class="postlink">Spot is SNROM</a>. I thought it'd be UNROM seeing as it's about <a href="http://www.retrojunk.com/details_commercial/1480/" class="postlink">the Uncola</a>. But I guess it needs the PRG RAM for something.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Aug 06, 2011 6:15 am</p><hr />
