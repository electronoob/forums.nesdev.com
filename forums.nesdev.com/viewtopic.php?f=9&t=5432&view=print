		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi guys,
<br />
<br />I've been puttering around in my spare time trying to puzzle out the NES's architecture and I have a few questions regarding video memory that I haven't been able to answer yet. I apologize is these are silly, I'm still a little new at this.
<br />
<br />In regards to name table mirroring: If I were to disable the internal 2k CIRAM and provide 4k on the cart to use instead so that all name tables have their own area in memory, would games that utilize horizontal or vertical mirroring still work? (assuming no mapper for the time being). In other words, does a game that uses horizontal mirroring *expect* to be able to read data from the mirrored area?
<br />
<br />Why is the base limit without a mapper on CHR-ROM size 8k? From the schematic it looks as though the NES can actually address 16k work of CHR-ROM via A0-A13.

When I'm programming, I often try to make my software 4-screen friendly, as long as there is no big performance hit.<br /><br />If you want to try it out, FCEUXD lets you change the mirroring type on the fly on the name table viewer. However, if the game uses a mapper than can control the mirroring and it's changed all the time, you can't really select another mirroring because it's constantly set to what the game wants.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Keebler wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Why is the base limit without a mapper on CHR-ROM size 8k?

<br />Probably because there is no way to index more than 256 background tiles and 256 sprite tiles with 8-bit indexes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />On the NES, 8x16 pixel sprites already index all 512 tiles.
<br />
<br />As for backgrounds, there are <em>ten</em> bits available for indexing a tile. The PPU could have switched tile banks based on bits from attribute value. For example, it could have provided two banks: one for attributes 0 and 1 and another for attributes 2 and 3. Under such a system, blatant recolors like <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/blogs/Jordan+Grim+Devore/the-bushes-in-smb-are-actually-green-colored-clouds-and-other-crazy-facts-67302.phtml" class="postlink">SMB1's cloud bushes</a> might be more difficult, but it would open up more possibilities for tiles. Nintendo ended up not making the PPU do that, but it's possible for a mapper to do that by watching attribute fetches.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Your idea of using the attribute bits for selecting CHR banks is quite interesting.
<br />
<br />There are also 3 unused bits in the attribute byte of the sprites which they could have used to select banks. This is probably not possible with a mapper though, because apparently those bits aren't stored anywhere.

<br />And on the Super NES, they do.
<br />
<br />As for my own programs: I don't test on 4-screen. In fact, my standard init code clears PPU $2400-$2BFF because I know that stretches across both pages no matter whether a cart is set for horizontal or vertical mirroring.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The PPU does address 16kB.  I know when I used a 32kB RAM chip for my CHR setup on Squeedo, the palette writes (at $3F00-$3F10) would end up in that same position in the CHR chip, overlapping one of the CHR banks (presumed I would use that bank for BIOS functions, etc.).  BTW, in that case it's just a couple NAND gates to force it to use a certain bank when nametables are active.
