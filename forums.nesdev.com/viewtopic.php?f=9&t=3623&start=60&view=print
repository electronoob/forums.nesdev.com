<br />
<br />yes I ment to go back and fix that but sence you already quoted me I will not bother but for the second comment its a little hard to go into witout  posting an even longer run on sentance but I will try to explain
<br />
<br />
<br />1.All of the apps are setup so you can use them from a distance and useing a DVD remote with ease
<br />
<br />2.the display and interfaces are much better suted for a TV and with hacked BIOS you can get the display up to 1080i
<br />
<br />3.you can easally ftp whatever you like into its HDD without a lot of setup and work
<br />
<br />4.there are meny aftermarket devises witch you can install into it witch add neat funtionality 
<br />
<br />Its very difficult to explain the xbox stock itsself is not very good I agree but with all of its homebrew it becomes very usefull, to understand it would help to read around the link I gave you earleyer, but you cant realy get it till you see for yourself
<br />
<br />I am sure if you were to install "hacked" bios in one and play around with it for a wile you would come around, trust me it would be worth the trouble
<br />fyi if you do make sure to get xbox media center,wich was originally an mplayer port but has evolved a bit sence then

<br />the xbox dose support file shareing and itunes music share along with all popular network protocals I know of
<br /> I just like ftp better so this is what came to mind
<br />your end of the conversation was a cheap computer, what you are discribleing is fairley pricy and oviousley an expencive computer would be better

<br />A "cheap pc" is either ~$600 for the Mac Mini (brand new), ~$400 for a full mini itx computer (brand new), or ~$200 (guess) for a good condition xbox with mod chip, hard disk, wireless, remote, etc added.  Going for used parts drops the computer prices by at least $100 each.  Nothing I described (except dual link dvi) needs anything more than the most basic Mini or PC.  If you wanted to talk about expensive computers I would say get an 8 core Mac Pro, a couple TB of disk, 4x 30" monitors, etc   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />All systems have composite video output, no idea about quality between them tho.  I think every system Apple has sold for a few years can have svideo and composite through the same cheap dvi adapter.  Almost every mini itx board now has composite out too but again I don't know if its high quality.  Not sure there is any quality check I can do on my unmodded xbox vs laptop.

<br />Nestopia is one of the most accurate NES emulators for the PC.  Nestopia is easily more accurate than your NOAC based systems, and it has two Mac OSX ports.  Assuming the ports are good and your hardware is powerful enough, this emulator is far more accurate than your NOACs:

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I got a new challenge for all of you to chew on:  I just bought Klax for NES on Amazon (mint condition, I am pleased) and it plays 100% correct on my real NES; however, on my Yobo FC, during gameplay (nowhere else like menus, etc) the top half of the screen (conveyor belt) displays perfectly, but the bottom half of the screen "jitters." By jitters I mean it looks like its comprised of 5 rectangles spanning the width of the screen and they shift about 1~2 pixels pretty much constantly, kinda like a bad earthquake effect.  It doesn't really hinder gameplay but just thought I should add that to the database since I've never heard it mentioned anywhere else before and Klax is a pretty uncommon game so I'm sure not many people have tried it before. 
<br />
<br />Anyone know what is causing this?  I can only think its from either a refresh rate glitch/bug or the cartridge chip isn't making a good enough connection since the chip sits inward a little more than a regular NES cart.  I figure its the refresh though since it only happens during gameplay.
<br />
<br />Irrelevant info:  In case anyone is interested, Klax is an awesome game and it is definitely on par with Tetris and Bust-A-Move in my book.  Also, the very...ahem...time-dependent intro "it is the nineties and there is time for...KLAX" is so awesome I made it into a shirt:  <a href="http://i152.photobucket.com/albums/s190/specv4life/klaxshirtfinal.jpg" class="postlink">http://i152.photobucket.com/albums/s190/specv4life/klaxshirtfinal.jpg</a>

<br />
<br />
<br />It is due to the poor quality of the NES on a chip in there.  The PPU bus doesn't work like a true NES, so the IRQ controller in the RAMBO-1 chip is getting confused.  Klax uses RAMBO-1 instead of MMC3.  It's close, but different.  Klax needs some pretty close timing of those IRQs (it fires them off every 8 scanlines), and without decent accuracy, it won't run no way no how.  The funny PPU cycles are also why MMC5 fails-  it uses the PPU timing to extract information on what is being rendered so that it can properly synch up.  
<br />
<br />Without throwing a logic analyzer on there, there's no way to know exactly what they are doing wrong, but it could have something to do with how sprites are fetched.   
<br />
<br />Other fun games to test that might show issues:
<br />
<br />Marble Madness (does some mid-frame writes)
<br />Micromachines (absolutely insane PPU stuff, hehe)
<br />Pirates! (mid-frame bankswitching)
<br />Punchout! (prolly will work, but you never know)
<br />Bigfoot (during the two truck thing where it turns the PPU off and loads sprites)
<br />Huge Insect (sprite 0 re-assignment fun)
<br />Battletoads (notorious pain in the ass for emulator writes awhile back)
<br />Tank Demo (not a released cart but would be fun to try)
<br />Spelunker (does some NMI oddness)
<br />Door Door (frame IRQ stuff)
<br />
<br />
<br />Those are some good ones off the top of my head that give emulator writers nightmares.  Does anyone emulate Micromachines properly?  I know Nintendulator runs it, but it uses a hack to do so.  The Super8's NoaC is pretty good and runs Micromachines and all the other games listed above, including MMC5.  The same chip is included in the Game Axe so they should all run there, too.  I tested the FDS on the Game Axe and it works as well <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Nestopia also runs Micro Machines correctly, but it probably uses the same hack as Nintendulator.  Nestopia does show noticeable, but not constant glitches using the NROM versions of Ian Bell's Tank Demo.
