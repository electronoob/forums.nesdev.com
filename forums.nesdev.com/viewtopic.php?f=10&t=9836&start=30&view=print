I'm not asking you to make one for me, but once I get to grips with this, I might make one myself and ask people to verify it for me.

But there may be edge cases during your game development where &quot;weird things&quot; happen on the screen which you didn't expect (see those Youtube videos I linked -- when I wrote the code it worked fine on emulators at the time (Nesticle and iNES) but on the actual hardware broke badly as you can see).  If those things happen, that doc can often explain why, especially near the end of VBlank if you're adjusting $2005/$2006 in some way then when the electron gun starts drawing things, starts drawing &quot;garbage&quot; or the wrong stuff making you go &quot;WTF!&quot; (which was my reaction the first time I saw my intro code on an actual console).<br /><br />You can work around all of those &quot;edge cases&quot; by simply doing what tokumaru says or I have said (i.e. &quot;reset all the things!&quot;, haha :-) ) and you'll be fine.

You only have to understand the stuff behind the scene if you scroll with the Y co-ords changing. X scrolling you need no background, just sprite 0 then a write to $2005. But yeah, don't worry about it. Just make sure the last thing you do is write to $2000 and $2005 at the end of your VBlank code. It's dead simple to do, and not confusing in any way. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here's my take on scrolling:<br /><br />The PPU was trying to offer a lot of functionality with little hardware. Scrolling, VRAM access address, and even rendering are implemented with some shared hardware. It's sort of like quantum physics, very involved and requires understanding how it all works.<br /><br />There are simplified abstractions people have built on top of this, where if you do A, B, and C, it'll act in this simplified manner, but if you do anything else it falls apart and you have to go back to the full detail. These abstractions are solid and really do act as stated as long as you stay within the limits they state (e.g. one might require that you only write to $2005, $2006, and $2007 when rendering is disabled or during vblank, never anywhere else).<br /><br />Even experienced NES programmers use simplified abstractions and know when to drop down to the quantum level when they're stepping outside the abstractions. Abstractions are effective ways to reduce mental load when dealing with things, and well worth it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The more you work with hardware/devices developed in older times (circa 70s, 80s, and early 90s), the less likely you'll be inclined to think the behaviour is &quot;strange&quot;.  In the case of the NES/Famicom -- and as has been admitted by folks at Nintendo Co. during interviews -- the hardware was developed on a very minimal budget (intentionally)... yet it's one of the most revolutionary and memorable consoles ever.  I actually started with the SNES/SFC first, then later did NES/FC.  The SNES/SFC, from a programmers' perspective, is a much more easier-to-develop-for console; there's a lot less stuff you'd think is &quot;strange&quot;, and a lot more memory-mapped registers that are for specific purposes and are documented.<br /><br />&lt;crotchety old koitsu rant&gt;<br />No offence intended in the least (towards you or anyone) by this statement, but: anyone born after 1980 would do well to sit down and actually <strong>use and develop</strong> on a platform (of any sort) made during their birth-decade or a decade prior.  Take away all the abstracted APIs -- make them work on bare metal.  Make them work on a platform with no OS (excluding what comes with the on-board ROM, ex. Apple II series).  Watch how many cry and pee themselves.<br /><br />Computer science history lessons in a classroom and blabbity blab on Wikipedia don't do justice -- when you make people get their hands dirty, you can see who truly understands how something works vs. who can only grasp things at an abstract level and think what goes on under the hood is &quot;truly just black magic&quot;.  CS courses at college/uni do this to some degree, but they don't make you work on minimalist platforms, they instead teach you how to think or solve thing X with certain restraints.  It's different when you have limited resources due to hardware limitations; there's no prof saying &quot;naughty naughty you can't do that&quot;, instead there's the realisation that you've only 2KBytes of RAM and you'd better use it wisely.<br /><br />The &quot;black magic&quot; for me, despite being low-level, is the hardware itself -- I don't do EE, I don't design circuits -- so as long as there's good documentation from the hardware or IC engineers, I'm generally content.  Now compare that to people of today who are used to abstract APIs or whatever other nonsense that sits maybe 7 or 8 &quot;layers&quot; above the actual CPU (or GPU) itself.<br /><br />When I see folks like yourself, Dafydd, younger but working on older platforms and actually struggling and advancing/learning in good ways, it makes me really happy to see.  What you're learning now will actually help you in all sorts of ways outside of the NES/FC; the techniques, thought processes, and design choices that you're learning as you go will influence you.<br /><br />Eventually you'll start wondering why present-day systems (usually x86/x64 Windows systems) bog down, aren't responsive, or just seem to &quot;waste time&quot; doing god-knows-what (all the abstraction makes it almost impossible to troubleshoot/debug/figure out).  Or you'll look at some code somewhere (professionally or open-source) and say &quot;WTF?  This thing takes up 72MBytes of RAM and 40MBytes of disk space, yet all it does this one simple thing?!&quot; -- then proceed to write the same thing but 1/100th smaller and a thousand times faster -- all because you worked on a very minimal (or embedded) platform made decades prior and got rid of reliance on horribly abstracted piles of crap (ex. Microsoft's .NET framework, highly abstracted languages, highly OO-focused languages, etc.).  *waves hands* You don't need most of that crap.  For present-day stuff, a C compiler (not even C++) will do you just fine.<br /><br />I see the systems of today and I remember literally <strong>dreaming</strong> about such speeds and capacities.  Yet here they are -- all running like molasses, wasting/abusing CPU time, disk space, RAM/resources, etc. *because* so much software and environments (I would border on saying even OSes in some cases) lack developers who have developed on minimalist platforms.  Send 'em back in time and watch 'em suffer.<br />&lt;/crotchety old koitsu rant&gt;

I want to know how this thing works on a level where I can understand what the hardware is actually doing, but that doesn't mean there aren't things that will strike me as strange on the way (for the record, I also think it's strange people are using Java.

I now work for a company where we program in VB and have a database that we manage. The first table I ever created on our database used bit flags to determine whether or not one of our stores would be closed on a given day of the week, and I was actually going to create the table so that those 7 bit flags would fit into 1 8-bit field, instead of using 7 &quot;bit&quot; fields, which all use 1 whole byte. I showed the table to my boss and he laughed, because I was being so conservative.<br /><br />I also love when people refer to the days of 64k of RAM as if it were the lowest possible capacity. I will ALWAYS bring up the NES having 2k, and the Atari having 128 bytes! It's hard for some people, especially today, to wrap their mind around what you can accomplish wish such a small amount of resources.
