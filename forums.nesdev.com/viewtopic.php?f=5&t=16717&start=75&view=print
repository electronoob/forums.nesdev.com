I don't think there's any real-time sample streaming or anything like that happening.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Running the music engine on the S-SMP instead of the S-CPU has several advantages.<br /><br /><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>The S-SMP has access to fine time bases, from 125 Hz on up. The S-CPU would normally be limited to the S-PPU's 60.1 or 50.0 Hz time base unless it uses VTIME, and VTIME is usually in use anyway for graphics. This means more precise tempo. </li><li>Because the time base is independent of the S-PPU, the program running on the S-SMP does not need adjustment for NTSC or PAL-M on the one hand vs. PAL on the other. </li><li>Running audio on the S-SMP frees up the S-CPU for game logic rather than music logic and waiting for the S-SMP to acknowledge every note, program change, pitch bend, and control change. </li><li>Linear-pitch portamento and vibrato need multiplication, as does volume adjustment. The SPC700 has a multiplier, but the 65816 relies on an interrupt-unsafe MMIO for multiplication. </li></ol><br />There isn't even the drawback of a drastically different programming model, as there is with the Z80 and 68000 on the Genesis or contemporary arcade system boards. The 65816 is a 65C02 with 16-bit registers, and the SPC700 is approximately a 65C02 with rearranged opcode numbers.<br /><br />The one drawback is that you lose maybe 8K of audio RAM for the player and the current song's order table and pattern data.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know how much space is <em>normally</em> taken in commercial games because I haven't traced into them. But extrapolating from <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=13589" class="postlink">music code that I wrote for another 6502 family CPU</a> (and am <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=200709#p200709" class="postlink">off and on porting to the SPC700</a>), I guess a player might fit in 2K and each song in maybe 3K at most. At that size, a game could load each song's order and pattern data in a matter of a few frames.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You could save a lot of CPU speed with HDMA.  Even without HDMA, you can still have the CPU get everything ready while it's waiting for the SPC700.  I also find the SPC700 way more frustrating than the 65816 to work with.
