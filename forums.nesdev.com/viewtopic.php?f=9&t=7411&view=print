		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't want to get too much into detail, but a controller port without a controller plugged in returns all 1's, right? Because it's pulled....low? Or does it get reversed inside the console so it returns 0's? I wrote a program to detect paddle or controller or none, but it doesn't work for the controller, but it does for the paddle.
<br />
<br />The controller reads 1's for button pressed and all 1's on open bus, correct? And the way the controller is made, the buttons will not all be pressed (All 1's) so then we can assume no controller is plugged in, right???? -is stumped-

<br />
<br />I don't know how you can detect it... Does the NES has direct access to the latch clock line?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />AFAIK, when controller isn't plugged in it will read as all zeroes (this makes sense, so that running programs wouldn't think buttons are pressed down when the controller is unplugged). When an official Nintendo controller is plugged in, it will returns 1's after the first 8 reads. So you could test the result of 9th read, if it's 0, there's no controller. But IIRC some of the 3rd party controllers return 0's after the 8 reads, so this method would detect them as unplugged.. which is baaad. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Real hardware is not a NOAC system or any other clone. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />But I don't think I'll need to use the 9th bit way, since if it isn't plugged in, it won't read any buttons as said before, so it'll do nothing, so it's all good.

<br />It is the controller that decides the data returned, not the system.  A real Nintendo brand console with a third party controller is still real hardware.

<br />
<br />A clone controller is not a real controller. I won't let 3rd part crap limit what can be done if needed. If we were at the limits of the crappiest clone hardware weather it be the console or controller, we might as well stop writing stuff. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />And what do you mean then run on real hardware, tepples? I've found my solution but the more information that is in one post the better so if you could elaborate that'd be awesome. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know what exactly you need to detect this for, but "for safety" you could add some extra checks, so that if 9th bit is 0, but any of the 1st-8th bit are non-zero (user is pressing buttons), set a flag to ignore the controller detection.
<br />
<br />So let's say you want to pause the game when no controller is detected. This way it would only pause it at the beginning of the game/whatever, and after user pressed START, it would work fine after that (with controller detection disabled).
<br />
<br />This could be detected seamlessly in a menu. However it wouldn't work perfectly if user decided to switch to a different controller after the fact. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> But it wouldn't break the game either. And of course it would be possible to check it while the game is running too... I just don't feel like it's a very important feature since I don't ever remember the controllers coming loose by accident.
