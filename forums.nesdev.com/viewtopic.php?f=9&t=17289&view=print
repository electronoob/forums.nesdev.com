I don't really have a suggestion on bidirectional data lines though.  Series resistors will limit the current which is better than unlimited, but the ideal value will depend on drive strength of the console and cart.<br /><br />You may want to come up with a game genie type device that actually includes proper level shifters, or play on a clone console that runs close to 3v to get around the issue.

If you look at the Vi (input pin max voltage) it's likely Vcc or Vcc+0.5v.  So if you supply Vcc with 3.3v, you'll be exceeding the max input voltage if you apply 5v.<br /><br />LVC families are generally good for level shifting but are slightly less versatile gate because they can't be supplied by 5v.  They will have a Vcc range typically of 1.6-3.6v and Vi max spec of 5.5v.  So these can be supplied by 3.3v and have 5v signals applied to their inputs.  Their outputs will be relative to the Vcc supply voltage, looking at Vo max it's likely Vcc.  So supplied with 3.3v the output pins will be Vcc or less, so you can safely use their outputs to drive 3.3v flash/logic/etc.<br /><br />AHC is a pretty convenient series because it can be supplied by 3-5v, and is 5v tolerant when supplied by 3v.  Vcc is allowed between 2-5.5v, and Vi max is 5.5v.  Where HC max Vi is depended on Vcc, AHC Vi max is independent of Vcc.  Personally I really like to use these gates because I only have to buy one part in bulk and can utilize it in various designs.  It can be supplied by 5v (unlike LVC) so I can use them for a design that's entirely 5v like NES UNROM mapper perhaps.  But they can also be used as level shifters when supplied with 3.3v, the Vi max is still 5.5v. Not all devices are offered in AHC series though, but my most commonly used 4x OR gate is availabe with 74AHC32.<br /><br />There are other families which are good for level shifting, but it comes down to what options are available for your desired logic function.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wouldn't be my first choice, but you probably could use certain 74HC parts, always check the datasheet for the specific chip in question.  This quote is from NXP's datasheet for their 74HC245:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Inputs include clamp diodes. This enables the use of current limiting resistors to interface inputs to voltages in excess of VCC<br /></div><br /><br />But it's usually going to be easier to just use LVC, AHC, VHC, LCX, LVT, etc.<br /><br />As an aside about LVC, when you look into Picogate parts like LVC1G, 2G, etc. you'll find ones that can be powered at 5V.  I'm using one like that in my controller port USB peripheral, but I selected one for its partial power-down support.

The S29GL032 rom in BYTE mode would make this pin A15 ~ same as the SNES pin it mates to.<br />The use of the 2 diodes suggest a 5v ---&gt; 3v conversion.<br /><br />It can't be the 5v version of the AM29F032D (which is a 48pin device) because that part, pin2 of that rom is not connected internally.<br /><br />There are NO KNOWN 3v roms that are 5v tolerant, and definitely don't conform to the 5v data sheet he sent to you.  I think you can safely say it's a lie/deception.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Being purely a hobbyist, I've been wondering myself about resistors versus level shifters. The consensus seems to be that a level shifter is the <em>right</em> way to do it, and using resistors is more or less &quot;better than nothing&quot; but not ideal. Normally, I would just accept that level shifters are the correct method and that's that. The only reason I question if using resistors is acceptable is because of the popularity of the Everdrive. The Everdrives have a decent user base. Surely, if using resistors was so bad it would be a more widely discussed topic. As in, not just limited to tech circles but even the average person would have some inkling of poor design. But <a href="https://db-electronics.ca/2017/07/05/the-dangers-of-3-3v-flash-in-retro-consoles/" class="postlink">this article on the matter</a> makes a good point, “Well, my device has been working properly for 2 years now.&quot; This is like saying, “I’ve been smoking for 2 years and I don’t have cancer. Therefore, smoking does not cause cancer.”
