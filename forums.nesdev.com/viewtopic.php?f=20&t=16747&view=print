The player select screen shakes horizontally and the same thing happens during game play.  It seems like every other frame it out of alignment.  If anyone has seen this issue before, perhaps you can provide me with a few hints to track this down?  Thanks.

It's an old emulator, but it used to be hosted on many web pages.  Whatever it is doing wrong, I'm doing the same thing incorrectly.<br /><br />I reviewed the flags in those instructions and I can't visually see an issue.  However, I did notice what appears to be a repeated typo in the <a href="http://www.pastraiser.com/cpu/gameboy/gameboy_opcodes.html" class="postlink">Gameboy CPU (LR35902) instruction set table</a>; the carry flag is marked as reset in all the SRA instructions.  My emulator is setting the carry flag to the LSB.<br /><br />If there is a particular test ROM that could vet the instruction flags, I'll gladly run it.<br /><br />I noticed a similar issue with Street Fighter 2.  Both of those are SGB roms.  I'm not sure if there is a connection.

That selection screen shakes horizontally.  <br /><br />In fact, the whole games seems like it is running at half speed.  It's almost like it renders the frame correctly and then it re-renders it a second time with the wrong scroll offset.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />[solved]<br /><br />The problem was related to LYC.  <a href="http://gbdev.gg8.se/wiki/articles/Video_Display" class="postlink">The wiki</a> says that LYC and related registers &quot;can be accessed even during Mode 3, but they have no effect until the end of the current scanline.&quot;  To postpone the effect of LYC updates, I introduced a cached LYC variable and my buggy code was using the cached value instead of the latest during VBLANK.  <br /><br />On a side note, I suspect that updating LYC actually takes effect immediately since writing to LYC can trigger an LCD STAT interrupt.  And, as such, I got rid of the cached version entirely.
