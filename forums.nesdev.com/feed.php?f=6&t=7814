An NsfCartDB site to match the NesCartDB site would be rockin!!<br /><br />EDIT: Or, as tepples suggested, just add your NSFs to the NesCartDB.

"Artist" is really a combination of the musicians and sound programmers.  If either one is bad, the whole thing sucks.  You can have great compositions get executed poorly, or have an awesome sound engine with bad tunes.  Sometimes the musician and sound programmer is the same person.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Sun Jun 12, 2011 7:26 am</p><hr />

I knew I should have done my idea sooner.  I've had NSFREPO.COM since late 2009 for the purpose of what Gil Galad is doing, more or less.  My idea was to keep it segregated from the Parodius line of hosting stuff but put a small amount of Google ads on it, solely to see if I could generate enough self-sufficient revenue to, in effect, "get Parodius to pay for itself".  Guess I'll have to find a new idea.<br /><br />My idea was to have a full-blow NSF archive site, with full details of every NSF (extracted from them directly), MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256 checksums of each, support people to upload their own NSFs, comments and a rating system, and basically a publicly-editable (well, not 100% anonymous; e.g. only specific users given access to it) database of all those NSF details.  The goal was to turn it into a "NES music repo" in a sense, listing of all the song composers, etc. etc...  And also to include/provide improperly-ripped NSFs or buggy ones, since there's lots of those around (certain songs missing notes or freaking out due to someone ripping it wrong).  Folks could use a Windows (or whatever; write it in C and make it work on all OSes) tool to query the NSF archive site to find out details about the .nsf file they had (using checksums).  "Oh, the NSF I have is the buggy one, screw this!"  You get the idea.<br /><br />Gil, if you're interested in the domain, I'd be more than happy to hand it to you (no charge) rather than watch it expire and go into the hands of a domain squatter.<br /><br />BTW, I'm not sure if you got these or not, but don't forget about Kevtris's NSF collection too!
