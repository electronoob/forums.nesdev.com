<br />Because the physical console is not a handheld. Laptop computers, Nintendo DS, GP2X, Android phones, Maemo phones, and the new Pandora PDA can run emulators.

<br />Or you could buy one of the many Copier units that were imported into the US. There are other, better options.

<br />Unlike older copiers, the Retrode is still manufactured. It's easier to find than a secondhand copier, especially because eBay bans sales of copiers. It also doesn't need a floppy drive or parallel port or other pre-1998 technology that isn't included in many newer PCs.
<br />
<br />Oh, and another thing that's better than the original console: Emulators support <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" class="postlink">save scumming</a> to a much higher degree than the authentic console. It's absolutely necessary if you've dumped Super Mario World and applied any of various <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell" class="postlink">platform-hell</a> IPS patches on top of it.

<br />
<br />What would really be cool, although impossible due to latency, would be real-time communication with the cartridge. That way your SNES emulator could play games with the three unsupported special chips. Or with better accuracy for the rest. But not even a RTOS could manage that.
<br />
<br />That said, I've heard copiers were considered illegal here, too; and that dumping games that way was no good. Could've been BS. But either way it's fine by me, I can dump them via serial through the joypad port -- no copier needed :)

<br /><div class="quotetitle">In <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#117" class="postlink">17 USC 117</a>, Congress wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">(a) Making of Additional Copy or Adaptation by Owner of Copy. â€” Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106 [which defines the exclusive rights of a copyright owner], it is not an infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer program to make or authorize the making of another copy or adaptation of that computer program provided:<br /><br />(1) that such a new copy or adaptation is created as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine and that it is used in no other manner, or<br /><br />(2) that such new copy or adaptation is for archival purposes only and that all archival copies are destroyed in the event that continued possession of the computer program should cease to be rightful.</div>
<br />This, when taken with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UMG_v._MP3.com" class="postlink"><em>Universal Music Group v. MP3.com</em></a>, makes Retrode look significantly more legit than your garden variety ROM site. But then I am not your lawyer.

<br />
<br />(2) is interesting. Let's say you dump your complete game collection. Now obviously you can't sell it, or you no longer have a legal claim to it. So what do you do if you don't want 4,000 cartridges cluttering up your studio apartment?
<br />
<br />To be perfectly legal, do you throw them all away? Or does even that act remove your ownership rights?

<br />Nintendo did do this, and they were indeed successful.  Nobody knows how exactly they accomplished this with customs (whether it be legal pressure or under-the-table handouts).  My source is an individual at Fairlight (the Amiga/PC group) who was selling SWC DX32 copiers at the time.
<br />
<br />My guess -- and this is speculative -- is that it probably a combination of "big corporate entity" and customs not truly understanding what it is they were dealing with.  On the latter point, remember this was the mid-to-late 90s, the US government had absolutely no brains about technology at the time.  Customs just does what they're told, and anything "grey market" customs can do whatever they want with.  Consider that the companies making said copiers were incredibly shady; changing company names regularly and so on, just to be able to stay in business.
<br />
<br />On the lesser point, Nintendo's international status and size/popularity at the time almost certainly had some involvement -- the same technique applies today; look at the whole Gizmodo/Apple fiasco.  Steve Jobs just had to make a phone call and suddenly a raid happens.  If this were some small mom-and-pop company, that raid would've never taken place (though an officer or investigator would have "eventually" gotten around to it).
