I've taken a break from 6502 dev while I learn more about game design in higher level languages I'm more comfortable with. Anyway, I've been really focused on music with the 2a03 (using MML) this whole time. And I've teamed up with some great developers recently to try and make 6 games in 6 months! It's called Retro Game Crunch.<br /><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shauninman/retro-game-crunch-six-games-in-six-months" class="postlink">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shauninman/retro-game-crunch-six-games-in-six-months</a><br /><br />You can read more about my background with the project here:<br /><a href="http://8bitmatt.com/retro-game-crunch" class="postlink">http://8bitmatt.com/retro-game-crunch</a><br /><br /><br />Be sure to checkout the &quot;updates&quot; section of the Kickstarter there's a short interview video with yours truly.<br /><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shauninman/retro-game-crunch-six-games-in-six-months/posts/357998" class="postlink">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shauninman/retro-game-crunch-six-games-in-six-months/posts/357998</a><br /><br /><br />We've had some pretty good press, at least here in the USA. Its been featured on G4tv, Polygon, Uncrate, IndieGames.com, The Verge, etc.<br /><br />Any support is greatly appreciated (even if it's just spreading the word about it), we need all the help we can get!<br /><br />-Matt

But don't get too hung up on platforms or the underlying tech. It's all about making good games. While not totally accurate, we do impose some of the limitations of the NES on ourselves to help us focus. The reasons for a PC release are because we know those tools, easy rapid development, and we're reaching a much larger audience than the homebrew scene. It's true there's a ton of free PC games released all the time but most of those lack in quality. You need to checkout Shaun's game &quot;The Last Rocket&quot; if you've got an iOS device. It's amazing. I truly believe he's one of the best game devs of our generation. He understands gameplay at a fundamental level and his skills are stellar. I also think you'd really enjoy the complete version of &quot;Super Clew Land&quot; (the first game we all jammed together on).<br /><br /><a href="http://vimeo.com/53185929" class="postlink">http://vimeo.com/53185929</a><br /><br /><br />P.S. I look at your site all the time and have learned a lot from you so thank you. <br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The idea is that you prototype the game on the PC, and then you have someone port it to NES.

I mean I wouldn't be here otherwise. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Just bundle it with a preconfigured emulator for the platforms of your choice (Windows). It will also run on almost every other platform, because there are NES emulators everywhere, including browsers (Java, Flash).

As you would only need an emulator that is compatible with just one or few games, it isn't as much troublesome to make as a general purpose emulator, with tons of mappers and emulated hardware quirks.

(NSFPlay is also permissively licensed though, so you could borrow its APU code if you like.)
