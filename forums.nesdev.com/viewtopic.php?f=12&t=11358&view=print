		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just over clocked the superfx chip on wildtrax using a 25mhz 2pin oscillator i found on an ancient 3com network card i had sitting around. The game was painful to play at stock speed but with the over clock it looks pretty smooth and has very little noticeable acceleration in game play.<br /><br /> Unfortunately I didnt have the 18pf capacitors to connect to together in the center as the guide i found on some other website outlined. Does anyone know how important it is for me to do that? the game seems to be running fine as is. Does anyone here have personal experience overclocking the cart to higher speeds, especially with other games? Is it worth it? I have a 27.xmhz oscillator I can scavenge off of an old sound card but all of the game play videos that ive seen of a 27mhz OC look a little &quot;too fast.&quot;<br /><br />I decided im going to try and make a multicart out of my Wildtrax cart. The game kind of sucks but since i got it for only 8 bucks you cant complain. Might as well try and turn it in to something better.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh, the original's using a ceramic resonator instead of a quartz crystal...<br /><br />You really should add the capacitors. If there's too little capacitance the crystal will definitely run faster than its rated speed, will vary frequency by a lot due to external random effects, and may randomly not start sometimes. (You could also see if you could find a 25MHz ceramic resonator)

Don't know how much of a difference that makes though.<br /><br />I'm going to try star fox 2 but I hear it gets a low frame rate on the wildtrax cart even with the OC. My next project is to build a ROM programmer. I can hear my wife complaining already lol. I've had my nose in the SNES for the last week.

In PAL format) needs 512k SRAM to run.   Since Wildtrax is PAL at 50htz, maybe that's why frame rate is low.   I thought the frame rates/differences between the different GSU1 and GSU2 chips had been debunked.  No difference except for size of rom it can handle.  Someone correct me here if I got this wrong...  I don't know if that applies the the  GSU2-sp1 chips.
