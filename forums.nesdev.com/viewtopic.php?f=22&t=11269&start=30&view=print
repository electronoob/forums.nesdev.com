For example, <em>Yoshi's Cookie</em> for NES moves things 8 pixels at a time, which is smoother than 16. With 8-pixel movement, you'll have to avoid attribute clash somehow; that can be done by leaving an 8-pixel gap between tiles when moving them.

The question is which compromise is more desirable.<br /><br />I personally believe that a tile size of 32x32 is a must have, and I'm intrigued in tepples's idea of showing a tile velocity of 8px per frame. Also the gaps actually do look more natural to me, especially once the tiles slide underneath when merging, but I'm wondering how to deal with the vblank time limitation. In the worst case, 208 nametable entries has to be updated in a frame. I guess the options are<br /><ul><li>threat the two nametables as a double buffered video frame and take two vblanks of times to update the other nametable</li><li>60/50hz update by interleaving the tiles to be updated in some visually acceptable way</li><li>maybe some forced blank trickery can extend the vblank time to write 208 tiles?</li></ul><br />Also I think there needs to be some sort of option switch (hidden or otherwise) that switches to the current color set and merging rule, to a color set and merging rule that matches the popular browser game. Because I actually like both.<br /><br />EDIT: spelling

Since you're not using sprites (right?), this gives you enough off-screen time to schedule 324 writes during vblank, and you &quot;only&quot; need 312 ((16+2)×16 (nametables) +(4+2)×4 (attribute tables)) to update the entire display every frame. Using both techniques to update the entirety in a single vblank will take 272 bytes of RAM from zero page and stack, 1592-1800 (depending on how much is store in the stack and how much is stored in zero page) bytes of ROM and will complete the entire set of writes in 2144 cycles (out of ≈2260).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm going to agree with the bigger 32x32 tile size, on the grounds that it seems a bit wasteful to have such a tiny playfield with such a huge amount of wasted space surrounding it. I'm sure you can dig up examples of wasted screen estate and nobody caring, but I still stand by opinion. I also like Tepples's animation, which is probably the most practical way to mitigate attribute clash without being able to have each tile be a sprite.<br /><br />Tiles sliding at different velocities would be doable. If you used Tepples's animation as your basis, each tile would need to slide at 1/4 increments between its starting position and destination. Since the board is 4x4, there are only three options: The tile moves 3 spaces, 2 spaces, or only 1 space. This could easily be implemented with a lookup table.<br /><br />To mitigate attribute clash like Tepples is doing, you assign a start-delay to each tile that has to move. If you press left for example, the leftmost movable tile starts its slide animation in the first frame, and any tiles to the right of it wait a frame. Then in the next frame, the next tile right starts moving, and the third tile (if any) waits until the next frame.<br /><br />Of course, this means the board can vary between taking 4-6 animation steps before it's finished animating. If this is a problem, you can stretch the animation out by scaling the start delays so the animation always takes 6 steps. For instance, if two tiles can move, the first one starts in the first frame, and the second one waits two frames instead of one. If one tile can move, it can wait two frames or move immediately, up to you. Or you can &quot;force&quot; the animation to only be 4 steps by accepting player input after the 4th step, which can interrupt the animation (the tiles just jump to place, they wouldn't be too far off anyway) if the player chooses to move again before it finishes.<br /><br />So there's lots of options for the bigger tile size to work, and I think that the only way we can tell if this is faithful to the gameplay or not is to try it out and see how it feels, though I'm pretty sure the game is still going to be 2048 regardless of what you guys bicker over. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> And even if all you guys disagree and we wind up with 5 different versions of this 2048 game, <a href="http://iwantaclone.tumblr.com/" class="postlink">'tis the spirit of mobile games anyway</a>.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Obviously it is a case of preference. Having my sprite-based game working well and having a familiar feel makes me believe that the sprite based approach is better. The smaller game block size is not bad. I can prove that there could be no larger game block background-tile based game that could be appropriated to accommodate smoother animations. It would be possible to use the occasional background sprite to aid in particular tasks to avoid the &quot;too many sprites on a scanline&quot; problem but even that is only a very minor problem.

That's 7 sprites to get the animation correct for one game block. There are scenarios where 12 game blocks would need to move simulaneously creating a demand for 84 sprites, which cannot happen. If that is not a proof I don't know what is. The next size smaller is 2x2 game blocks, which I achieved fluid animation using lots of sprites. Any 3x3 or higher background tile method cannot achieve the proper fluidity of animation.<br /><br />Q.E.D.

Do I need to illustrate this with another animation?<br /><br />But in practice, did people who played <em>Dr. Mario</em> care that everything moved in 8-pixel jumps? If not, lack of &quot;proper fluidity of animation&quot; is no deal-killer.<br /><br />I'm not trying to say that there's no place for a game using 16x16 pixel tiles. But something simulating <a href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Puzzle.txt" class="postlink">desk accessories</a> is probably better in a faux-windowed environment, like <a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-7-least-necessary-pirated-video-games_p2/" class="postlink">Windows 98 for NES</a>, not in a traditional full-screen environment.
