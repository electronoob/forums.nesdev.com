		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Trying to get reacquainted with the PPU:
<br />
<br />* I've been looking at the Famicom (ntd_8bit.jpg) schematics. It shows that PPU /CS (/DBE) is asserted during the high state of Phi-2. Does Phi-2 high indicate the address bus is valid? (maybe analogous to /MREQ on a Z80 or /AS on a 68000)
<br />
<br />* A 2SA937 transistor is used to amplify the video output. This part isn't available anymore. What is a suitable replacement? The video output circuitry seems deceptively simple, assuming Nintendo skimped on quality for a lower part count are there any modifications that can be made for better composite video output other than what the schematic shows?
<br />
<br />* To my understanding when the PPU is in "Slave" mode, it outputs data on the EXT3-0 pins corresponding to the 2-bit pixel and 2-bit attribute information for both sprites and backgrounds. However there is no way to tell if pixel data belongs to a sprite or the background.
<br />
<br />If all palette entries for opaque sprite pixels were set to $30 (max luminance) and the remaining ones were set to $00 (min. luminance without getting into the sync range), the video output would then include a sprite-or-background indicator. I don't know the actual voltages but the video output could then be like this:
<br />
<br />0V - ("Blacker than black") Sync
<br />.3V - (Black) Opaque background pixel or transparent sprite pixel
<br />1V - (White) Opaque sprite pixel
<br />
<br />The output could be run into a LM1881 to extract the composite sync portion of the signal for driving a monitor , and from there you'd somehow strip the sync information out and coax the latter two to TTL compatible signals. Now you could differentiate between sprite and background pixels, and I guess run the output into something fancy like a RAMDAC or mix it with the digital output of another PPU, etc.
<br />
<br />But are the EXT3-0 outputs in sync with the composite video output, or does it lead or lag it by any amount? Maybe it wouldn't be possible to latch EXT3-0 and the recreated sprite indicator bit at the same time? How feasible is this?

<br />
<br />Other way around, PPU slave mode means those pins are inputs for color data from the master.  Can't be used to recreate the video output.

<br />Seriously, good to see you here, big fan of your work on the Sega side of things. Might I ask an offtopic question (feel free to reply via PM if you don't want to clutter this thread) - what exactly was your input on the iPhone Sonic 1 project? I noticed both you and "SpritesMind Community" got a special thanks.

<br />
<br />I have not heard of the iPhone Sonic 1 project until now, so I assume they found my docs and/or emulators useful somehow. Thanks for bringing it to my attention.
<br />
<br />Clutter contribution:
<br />
<br />Maybe an easier solution to maintain a full range of colors would be to connect the composite video outputs of two PPUs to a 4066 mux, prior to amplification, and check when EXT1-0 of one of the PPUs was low, indicating a transparent pixel. Then the output of one or the other one would be enabled. This is what Sega has done in some of their multi-VDP setups with the RGB output.
<br />
<br />But it would only work if EXT1-0 were valid for the duration that the pixel data on the video output was displayed. I'm still unsure about that as they are tapped at an earlier point in the pixel output "pipeline", but perhaps the difference between the two is just a few tens of nanoseconds. Or not.
<br />
<br />In fact, there's no reason you couldn't chain together 3 or 4 PPUs this way, as long as the sync input and clock was common between them all. Any thoughts?

<br />
<br />So, having read this and the follow-ups, I'm confused as to what are you trying to achieve? (Better picture quality? Multiple background layers and exceeding the 8/scanline limit?)

<br />
<br />Hey, thanks for the info.
<br />
<br />I was interested in finding some way to put the pixel data outputs to good use, other than chaining two PPUs together directly like Nintendo intended. I have two PPUs on hand and would like to do something fun with them outside of the NES environment.
