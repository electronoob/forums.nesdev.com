Help out Buyuu with his SNES emulator? etc?<br /><br />I'm not sure you'll be able to raise the kind of money you would have been able to 6 months ago, I know it sucks, but I just think that's where we are today. What are your real thoughts on that?<br /><br />Thanks for offering to look into the SD2SNES. I doubt you could make a lot of money on something like that, but if that is what drives you, set up a Patreon, with the goal to make that happen. I bet that would generate some buzz.

So, that being said, what is your plan?</div>I've told you my plan. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I'm not interested in competing with Kevin's console and I'm not interested in making a commercial product as I've said multiple times in the past. I also don't make PCBs. My private consulting company makes custom FPGA IP cores and throws them over the fence to our customers. Now granted we do work with COTS FPGA boards, but we don't make our own. Obviously I have to prioritize my (and my other contractor's) time to my paying business customers over SNES development - they pay much better. Lol. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />My target audience is totally different from Analogue's closed-source, closed-hardware commercial system. If I had intended on making something like that I would have stopped working on my SNES a long time ago when I originally found out about it in December 2016 when Chris Taber contacted me. Lol. Because there is no way my company could have gotten it out the door prior to the release date that Analogue had planned - I simply don't have the man-power given all of our other contracting work. SNES can't take priority over my core business customers - that would be a pretty stupid move on my part.<br /><br />My number one goal when working on this console and others is always to have fun and learn cool stuff. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Period.</span></strong> I don't have enough motivation to do it for any other reason. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> It's amazing how much of a better FPGA designer I have become re-creating these old consoles. And Kevin is part of that too because he's taught me so much over the last many years. Hell, Kevin is so talented sometimes I think you could just stand next to him and learn purely through osmosis! XD<br /><br />In any case, my point is (and I've stated this before), if the campaign is funded great, if not great. Remember that I never intended to release the source in any way/shape/form. I created the SNES for _myself_ to have fun, not for anyone else. It was someone else's idea to crowd fund and open source it, not mine. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">XtraSmiley wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Are you going to release for free?</div>I'm sure China would love that, but, no....HAHA. If they want the source they can pay for it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">XtraSmiley wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Help out Byuu with his SNES emulator? etc?</div>Yes, I'll probably release all of my test ROMs eventually regardless.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">XtraSmiley wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What are your real thoughts on that?</div>I've given you my real thoughts. I don't think I have fake ones... XD<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">XtraSmiley wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Thanks for offering to look into the SD2SNES. I doubt you could make a lot of money on something like that, but if that is what drives you, set up a Patreon, with the goal to make that happen.

Of course its been a while and I haven't used it in years but I think this could be an invaluable learning opportunity for students.<br /><br />I understand the potential minefield of issues with releasing it but perhaps there is some way that you could license it to interested learners while still preventing it from being used/abused commercially.<br /><br />I'm no expert but I seem to recall altera had some sort of scheme like this for their nios cores. I believe you could encrypt certain parts of the source code or use an IP core locking solution: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.altera.com/solutions/partners/partner-profile/designgateway-co---ltd-/ip/iplock-ipcore-protection-system.html">https://www.altera.com/solutions/partne ... ystem.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />Cheers

I'm looking at doing homebrew that uses the SA-1 but don't want to desecrate a donation cart to get one nor would I want to release homebrew that encouraged others to do so.
