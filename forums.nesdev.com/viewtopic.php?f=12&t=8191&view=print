		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi guys,
<br />
<br />I'm trying to write to a am29f032b with a Willem GQ-4x programmer. Unfortunately I'm not having much luck. The chip will not ID, Verify or blank check.
<br />
<br />I'm using a base adapter (model: ADP-082) with a TSOP adapter ADP-077. The only setting in the Willem software is for a 29f032d.
<br />
<br />Does anyone here have experience flashing these chips with this device? If so can you offer some assistance. 
<br />
<br />Also, is there a difference between the 29f032d and 29f032b. Will the 29f032d work for snes games? 
<br />
<br />Finally, what programmer do you guys use to program your chips?
<br />
<br />Thanks!

<br />I made progress on this and thought I would post my results in case anyone else has problems with this.

<br />On the ADP-082 adapter there is a jumper for v1.0 and v2.0 - Jumper must be set to v2.0

I already posted where to connect the extended address line on a GQ-4X. As for mysteriousity, people mostly use the custom tsop to maskrom adapter board to program those chip. I remember the official adapter having issue on gq-4x, a quick search on the gq-4x official forum will tell you many people had issue.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />are you talking about this?
<br />
<br />For the extended address, the pin on the 40 pin zif socket of the GQ-4x are as follow (found by trial and error  ) 
<br />
<br />
<br />A19 = PIN 4 
<br />A20 = PIN 37 
<br />A21 = PIN 38 
<br />
<br />It might be the same or similar for the G540 if you're lucky.
<br />
<br />So this means I bend those pins on the adapter and connect them on the top address lines to the GQ-4X respective pin sockets?
<br />
<br />
<br />And besides that,  Another member contacted me with another bug, if this is the solution, it is only part of it. he pointed out a GQ-4X software bug.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />yea very unstable. I was recommended by buyicnow staff to unprotect the chip, and when i try the software does a massive error and freezes up real bad.
<br />
<br />Im sorry if I come up lazy or slow, but I still don't have clear if the way I described how to place the extra address lines is the correct way. 
<br />
<br />My first language is not English and sometimes is hard to get the right meaning out of instructions. or I confuse instructions.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Haha, my little Atari game is more than most people ever accomplish. Also, what other SNES games are on there? I mean, there's not much more SNES homebrew to go around to put on a multicart, so it must be hacks, so it must be just a bunch of Nintendo games on one then. Not that I have a problem with that myself, it's just.....you didn't really create anything still, so I don't have the same respect as somebody who actually knows what they're doing by research and working at it.<br /><br />And I do make games. I made some test ROMS too. And I don't think I'm the shit, I'm a joke compared to most people here with knowledge, but I still do know a thing or two about NES programming and such things still. And I don't have an Atari game, although I do have the A2600 game port of Kaboom done. And I think it looks great, but you should probably ask <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=71026" class="postlink">Tokumaru</a> weather it really looks <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz6UkX45FH0" class="postlink">ugly</a>.

I doubt they're not hacks. And prototypes don't count. And that's good the money is going to them, good stuff. If it wasn't, I'd be disappointed in our community by backing people stealing peoples Homebrews!<br /><br />And you're not a developer, that's fine, I don't care. Just try to learn something when you ask a question, don't just want walked through it.<br /><br />And I still, as of this post, have made 0 Atari games. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
