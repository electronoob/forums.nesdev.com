<br />
<br />The 28-pin chip is the PRG chip.
<br />
<br />So, you indeed have to remove both chips and install 2 sockets to turn it into a devcart.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />hayabusafmw, <strong>please</strong> read this message carefully. I'm sure you are able to understand this stuff, because you've been doing a good job so far, but <strong>you have to pay attention</strong>, in order to not get lost and ask the same thing over and over.
<br />
<br />First, you have to understand the <strong>address lines</strong> and the <strong>data lines</strong>.
<br />
<br />The <strong>address lines</strong> tell the chip the location of the data to be read from them. Address lines are identified by the letter <strong>"A"</strong> in pin diagrams. The larger the chip, the more address lines it has (because it has more addresses to access).
<br />
<br />Rewiring address pins is simple: "A0" always connects to "A0", "A1" always connects to "A1" and so on. <strong>"A"s with the same number should be connected</strong>. If your chip has more address lines than the board, connect those to GND. This will happen when the chip you are using is larger than the board expects.
<br />
<br />The <strong>data lines</strong> are always 8, because the NES is an 8-bit computer. The data pins are identified by the letter <strong>"D"</strong> or by <strong>"I/O"</strong> some times. <strong>You usually do not need to rewire those</strong>, as in most (if not all) chips these pins are at the same places.
<br />
<br />Another pin that has more than one name is the <strong>"Vcc"</strong> pin. It can also be called <strong>"+5V"</strong>. When rewiring, <strong>make sure that "Vcc" is connected to "+5V"</strong>.
<br />
<br />Some chips have <strong>"/CE"</strong> and <strong>"/OE"</strong> pins. They mean "Chip Enable" and "Output Enable". <strong>Just make sure these are connected to the holes with the same name</strong>.
<br />
<br />Flash ROMs also have the <strong>"/WE"</strong> (Write Enable) pin. This is used only when programming the chip, and <strong>should be connected to "+5V"</strong> on devcarts.
<br />
<br />That's about it.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Bregalad mentioned "track cutting", something you probably haven't heard before. The thing is that you need to get each pin to the correct destination, and stop them from going to the wrong places.
<br />
<br />Some people do it by cutting the tracks, some people do it by bending pins. I, for whatever reason, prefer to bend pins.
<br />
<br />Both ways work, you are free to do what you feel is best. Cutting tracks can result in a cleaner job, with all the wires under the board.

<br />It's easy to just  tell me do this do that  put a wire here &amp; there

<br />
<br />All i know is i got  heavy shreddin board MMC1  ( i want it to be more compatible with MMC1 games     (almost all if possible ) 
<br />
<br />Using At29c512 chips  32 pin  
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I checked the Pinout of the ''at29c512'' &amp; compare it with a nes CHR ROM - 256KBytes (32pin) 
<br />
<br />Im trying to figure it all the best i can...
<br />

However, there is no easy way to have a board support both CHR-ROM and CHR-RAM. So, with your SLROM board, no Megaman 2, sorry. To run Megaman 2 you need a MMC1 board with CHR-RAM, such as SJROM, SGROM, SNROM...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I checked the Pinout of the ''at29c512'' &amp; compare it with a nes CHR ROM - 256KBytes (32pin)</div><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">i feel dumb</div>
<br />You are not dumb, you just don't pay attention some times! Like above, when we told you that the "512" in your Flash ROM is in kilobits, so that's only 64 kilobytes. Not enough space to replace a 256 kilobytes chip, as you can see.
<br />
<br />You have to use larger chips for this. Like I told you before, you should have bought some AT29C040, that hold up to 512KB, enough for <strong>any</strong> NES game.

But "27" chips are EPROMs, and you'll need UV light to erase them. Only EEPROMs and Flash ROMs can be erased by the programmer. I don't even know why anyone would want regular EPROMs anymore, with EEPROM and Flash avaliable.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">i will try to pay more attention</div>
<br />Yes, please. Also, try to read previous posts once in a while, looking for any information you might have missed. It is common that we do not understand something the first time we read it, but since you are learning more and more about this, a previous message that felt like it was in chinese might start making sense. It happens to me all the time when I'm learning stuff.

<br />
<br />if not i will get refund &amp; buy from futurlec
<br />
<br />
<br />I bought Eprom Uv erasable because the 28 pin flash is no where to be found
<br />like imposible to find
<br />
<br />
<br />I bought a UV eraser that is on it's way
<br />also because sometime i get old Game board that can have UV eprom that i can recuperate:)
<br />
<br />thats the only reason
<br />
<br />I will only Use 1 Excitebike cart anyways it's more a test for the first time so next will be only 32 pins (wich i will always use flash AT29C040) like you recommend.

I found it helped to really study the available websites and the pinouts of the chips you are using. Then figure out the easiest way to rewire the board. Take it slowly and check for loose connections and unwanted connections at every step and then check again. Make lots of diagrams.

If so, just run the following command (of course, adjust the names of the files as needed): "copy /b mb.prg + mb.prg mb2.prg" at the command prompt (inside the folder where the files are, of course) to duplicate the program data.
<br />
<br />You'd better do this to the CHR file too, but since it is probably 8KB, you have to copy it 4 times ("copy /b mb.chr + mb.chr + mb.chr + mb.chr mb4.chr").
<br />
<br />If you program the chips ok, just place them on your board and see if the game runs.

<br />Actually SJROM is with CHR-ROM (Kevtris and his stupid misspelings...)
<br />But it's possible to switch from CHR-ROM to CHRRAM on a board. You have to desolder the CHRROM as usual, but rewire pins differently. All adresses and data can be merged as you want since it's a RAM chip (i.e. even if the adress and data lines on the chip have numbers, exchange any of them in hardware has no effect). It does have more /CE, /OE, etc..., instead of more adress pins. So be sure to wire them to power or ground as needed. 8kb SRAM chips (6264) are often 28-pins, so smaller than 32-pins EPROMs of SCROM, SLROM and SKROM, and the same size as 28-pins EPROMs of SAROM, SBROM, SFROM and SJROM.
<br />There is also the infamous R/W pin that must be wired directly on the connector, as opposed to ROM chips that does ignore this signal, since they cannot be written to. This is the most boring thing about porting a CHROM board to CHRAM, added to quite some more work on rewiring and actually buying the RAM chip. Also the chip have to come in a large DIP 28 package, and quite some RAM chips come in a small DIP 28 package. CHRRAM boards by Nintendo were made in order to accept both formats, however CHRROM boards just accept large chips only.
