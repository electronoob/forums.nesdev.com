		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello,<br /><br />Recently I purchased the Kazzo INL Retro Dumper-Programmer from InfiniteNESLives, with the intention of dumping the SRAM of all my old actual NES carts.  These were the games I grew up with, and <em>most</em> of them have still retained their save data all these years, and I just wanted to be able to back them up while I still could, before that part of my childhood was lost forever.<br /><br />Using the guide I found in <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?uid=6258&amp;f=9&amp;t=10788&amp;start=0" class="postlink">this thread</a>, I was successfully able to dump the SRAM of most of my games.  (Thank you so much!! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />)  However, there were a few couple ones I just could not get to work, at all: Shadowgate and StarTropics.  (Also, I haven't tried StarTropics 2, but for reasons I will explain in just a second, I am reasonably sure it will end up having the same problem.)  I stopped to do some research, and that was when I noticed the link between the working versus non-working ones was in the mappers: Dragon Warrior, NES Open, all the games that actually worked use the MMC1 mapper according to <a href="http://tuxnes.sourceforge.net/nesmapper.txt" class="postlink">this list</a>.  Shadowgate and StarTropics (and StarTropics 2) use MMC3.<br /><br />Ah, so I just run it using mmc3.ag instead of mmc1_sxrom.ag and that will fix it, right?<br /><br />Wrong.  Those games <em>still</em> won't work, even with the proper script, and that's where I'm stumped.  It acts like it's working, it goes through the motions and spits out a .sav file and everything, but that .sav file is basically blank and useless--putting it in with the other .sav files and testing with a ROM changes nothing; it acts like a completely new game with no save data whatsoever.  The .sav file is right there, but it may as well not be.  I assume that means the .sav file is no good, which means something in the dumping process didn't work.  And yes, I have confirmed that the save data still exists and is valid on the actual cart in an actual NES.<br /><br />So, now I turn to you.  Is there some sort of trick I'm missing to get the .sav files from transfer over properly?  You <em>can</em> dump the SRAM data of MMC3 games with an INL Kazzo dumper, right?

I did notice that in the mapper list, but I didn't think it was that big a difference (mostly because Shadowgate, which really is MMC3, doesn't work either.)  I guess that's two problems to work on, then!  Thanks for the clarification. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

The MMC3.ag seems to include access to PRG ram but I really would be guessing on the correct usage and/or editing. <br />Can you at least dump the ROM? That may demonstrate that the script is half way working. Beyond that try searching some of the Kaxxo sites, you may get lucky<br />yogi

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm also having trouble accessing the saves for StarTropics 1 and 2 and wondering if anyone figured out how to write to them. I tried tinkering with Anago's mmc3.ag script to read the MMC6 PRG RAM and the best I could do was to dump a bunch of junk and delete my cartridge saves. If anyone can figure out how to make Anago work with these two games I'd be grateful.<br /><br />TC: I was able to read and write my Shadowgate save, so I guess it's an issue with the individual cartridge. Maybe cleaning your cartridge would get it to work.

It's not the cartridge either because it does this with my Everdrive N8 (Famicom version through an adapter). I can have the game running perfectly fine, press Reset (shows the ED menu), start the last game loaded, and get the same solid screen. It takes several attempts to get the game to work again, even after a power cycle. If MMC6 is particularly flaky with the Hi-Def NES then perhaps it causes issues with the Kazzo as well.
