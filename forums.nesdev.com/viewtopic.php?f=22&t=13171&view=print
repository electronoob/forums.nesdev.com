The user would then have to quit the game, use their gps to go to the coordinates and find the password. They would then have to come back home. play the game again and input the password. the game would continue for X levels more before the game is complete. At the end of the credits it would tell a final location to the actual geocache in which case the user could go and find the cache and sign the log.<br /><br />Only thing is, I have NO idea how to do this. I assume its fairly straightforward because the game code is already written, more levels would have to be made and the password screen would have to be created. Anyone want to help me?

Have you ever programmed a game? Or modified one?<br />2. Are you familiar with the NES or 6502 programming?<br />3. Have you ever used cc65 or ca65 or ASM6 or NESASM or any other NES compiler?<br />4. Are you trying to figure out where to start on any of this?

I made a few programs in BASIC in High School but is been 15 years. I have done some rom hacks with editors though. And yes, I'm just looking for someone to help me. I have no idea where to start or what to do. I mainly got the idea from StarTropics - if you've played that game randomly in the middle of the game you have to input a password thats in the manual.

I read the programers document and it seems like levels can just be drawn with his application and saved as a &quot;name table&quot;. That's easy enough to do if i'm understanding it right. I just need to find a computer that runs windows.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />  I figure i'll make like 30 total levels. as for hacking the code out, im not too worried about that. If it happens, then they are only cheating his or her self. Plus, they might be able to cheat that part but they still have to crawl three quarters of a mile through a large drainage pipe to get to the final geocaching location.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Another word of warning. By coincidence, I started trying to use cc65 last week, and I could not get any of Shiru's stuff to compile correctly into an NES file.<br /><br />cc65 is a bit user un-friendly. And has 3 steps, and requires many files to be working together, and configured properly for the version of cc65 you are using...C code compiled with cc65 to ASM code, then ca65 assembles it to an Object file (or many), and then ld65 turns object files into NES file using .cfg file and .lib files. (take my info with a grain of salt, I've been using it for 1 week). I think I'm using a different version of cc65 than Shiru used, and none of the versions I found were totally compatible.<br /><br />The only way I could get anything to work beginning to end with C code, was to compile it with cc65, and then cut and paste the ASM code into an existing ASM file that I know will assemble correctly with my copy of ca65. I just ignored all of Shiru's .lib files and .cfg files and ran ld65 with files that I knew worked with my copy of ld65.<br /><br />Not to discourage you, just to let you know that if you're using Shiru's source code, you may have a few bumps along the way to getting it to compile correctly.

So it was easy enough to repeat the process and use ar65 to reassemble a new subset library.<span style="font-size: 67%; line-height: normal"> (Yes, I had to dig up an older copy of cc65—easy, thanks to git—to get the list of what objects were in it, but after that it was easy.)</span> Yes, I verified that chase.nes still builds and plays through.<br /><br />So, here's chase.zip, slightly modified to build cleanly against modern cc65. Still does the weird thing where cc65 produces assembly instead of object files, but whatever. I even added a makefile.
