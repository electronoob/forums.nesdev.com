<br />People have their own lives and jobs, it's not like they're on it full time.  And if you can't invest time in it constantly, you have periods where you'll go six months without doing anything.
<br />
<br />I've been mildly interested in NES dev for about 5 years now with several game ideas in mind and I don't have anything to show for it!
<br />
<br />I can definitely understand five years or more, especially when it's just a forum effort.  It can be hard to convince everyone on the team that one person's ideas take precedence over the rest.

<br />
<br />Yeah but at this rate, if sidequests are just getting in, thats gona be like 7-8 years from init. develoment to release :/ I don't think any game in history has went that long from making to release, except unreleased prototypes XD
<br />
<br />And look at the development team, thats like 10 people and apparently they definently know what they're doing (now?) :/
<br />
<br />It is a great game though, just walking around in the demo now.....^_^

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My #1 project, Dragon Skill has been in development since 5 years and 1 month (started on March 2005). I expected to complete the game in about 2 years and now 5 years later it's still far to being complete. The engine is completed, but the big issue is that actually creating enemies and coding their AI ended up infinitely more difficult than what I originally expected. The very hardest thing is bosses, you have to come up with an attack pattern and this is really difficult.
<br />Another issue I'll soon run into is memory usage : Even tough I only coded about 1/3 of the enemies I'd like to see in the game and 2/3 of levels, and about half of the music, $8000-$e7ff is taken and only $e800-$ffff remains free (aproximatively) so only 18% of ROM space remains free. This is yet another problem anyway and is not related to time it takes to make the game.
<br />
<br />For an RPG, there wouldn't be this issue because monsters would do simple things like attack and cast spells. However, there would probably be other things that you'd think they are easy before actually doing them, but that turns out to be infinitely harder. I haven't ever gone far in the development of a RPG (all I did is a lame attempt when I was 14ish before I decided to do Dragon Skill instead) so I don't know, you'd have to ask someone who did a complete RPG engine.
<br />The reason I stopped doing it is that I was really bad at coding stuff back then, now I'd probably be able to code a RPG engine when the need will arise.

<br />Ahh well the other is a little bit more but still, your one person. They're ten, and if each person coded one program over a 5 year period.....dangggg <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />
<br />So breglad, is bankswitching out of question because you could store the music in another part of the begining of the next ROM's space (33K Bytes In).....Im sure you know this but it seems like it may need it? Im not sure how much a full ame's music would be for such a game :/

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Recently I came to the conclusion that there is really no reason to use CNROM rather than UNROM. It's not like CNROM allows for sophisticated CHR bankswitching tricks, due to the huge size of the banks. Because of this, UNROM is more versatile because it allows you to distribute the available space between CHR and PRG freely, and you can also do CHR-RAM tricks if you want to.

<br />
<br />If you can get by with CNROM, that's cool though.  Loading data from CHR-ROM isn't uncommon, but I wouldn't do it if it ever looks like it could be a limitation (consider what amount re-usability of your code you might want for bigger projects later, for example).

<br />
<br />Compiling code seems to be possible, have you looked into nbasic?  It's true that a lot of the stuff made with it doesn't work right on an NES, but it's not because of any fault in the compiler.  It's NMI routine is just an RTI though, it would be a good idea to add-in something there (I can hardly fathom <em>not</em> using it).
<br />
<br />Family BASIC I'm sure would use some kind of interpreter and store all the BASIC commands and syntax in a special binary format.  It seems that maybe it's related to HuBASIC by Hudson, it's maybe better documented than Family BASIC, but might not be much help either.
<br />
<br />Maybe there is another BASIC interpreter written in 6502 with source available?  There are tons of small computers using the 6502, so I'm sure there must be something like that somewhere.
