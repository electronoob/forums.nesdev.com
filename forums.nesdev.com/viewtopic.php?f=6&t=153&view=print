		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You may remember quite a while ago, maybe over a year, I posted on the old boards about information regarding getting the Winglancer NSFs. I thought I'd replied to that but apparently not, but anyway, I did get them back then and they're great to have. So thanks <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.
<br />
<br />After much time passing, more recently I set about wasting my time sequencing them all to MIDI format [with a little help from NSF2MIDI]. So that's gone well. I did notice as part of the winglancer files though, there was one "arranged" track for the "Boss Mode" music, looking quite ominous amongst them.
<br />
<br />Now just today, after rooting around in Abfuku's [composer of the soundtrack's music] web journal and also what appears to be the home of Winglancer, I found a program called "TinyTssPlayer", which seems a very neat little program for playing such files yada-yada [I'm getting to the point, honest! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />]. The soundtrack that came with it was infact the Winglancer soundtrack in this TSS format, though all the tracks had equivelant arrangements, not just one. And these arrangements are fabulous!
<br />
<br />So my question is, do you know if there are NSFs existing of these other arrangements? I can link files if you like. Basically the soundtrack blows my mind and the arranged tracks blow my mind even more. It'd be great to have them as NSFs as they'd be easier to share around. I remember you (Memblers) linked me to vorc.org where I had them but there's only 9 out of what appears to be a total of 16 winglancer tracks.
<br />
<br />Any help would be great. Thanks lots!
<br />
<br />(also, is Tsu Ryu around this joint? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />)

<br />
<br />Thanks for looking into doing that Hally <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />. It'd be really appreciated. I did manage to get the TSS plugin for Winamp working so I'm sorta halfway there, but it's kinda hard to share them around. They're brilliant tracks though.
