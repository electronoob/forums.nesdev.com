		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have been working Game Doctor support for some time, and here it is.<br /><br />To load the game doctor images, just specify the first file of the set (the .A file) and the client software will pick up the other images if thier files are named properly in sequence, for example: file.A file.B file.C.  Just specify the first one is all you need to do, it will load it to the flash.<br /><br />Next up is the menu.  I have some suggestions from users and I will be releasing the next update containing the menu update.  The most important feature will be easier navigation and remembering the previous game selected before you turned the power off.<br /><br />The January New Years Special is still happening, use coupon code <strong>nesdev4life</strong> and you get the 128mbit (256 disk sides) model for only $25.  I am selling the 256mbit (512 disk sides) model too, it is easy to load it up with disks with the new game doctor support.<br /><br />The site has been redesigned, please let me know if any more information or resources is necessary.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />James

Doctor format will store $8000 x 2 files = 64K.<br />    Disk A is most large size which included :<br />    $200 + $8 + $8000 + $8000, it is bigger than 64K.<br /><br />So, I don't know if fdsemu will have bigger bank size for it.<br />If bank size same as before, then it will not work for all games.<br /><br />Also, another problem is Doctor 4+/6+ have save button.<br />So, each game have save disk. You need to add 1 bank for the save disk.<br />The save disk use to backup sram to disk. So, you can continue play game for the RPG.

Thanks for the additional information!<br /><br />I only have a Venus Game Converter 1M, and I did not know about the save function.  I can confirm operation with the disks that will work with it (yes they are bigger than $10000 bytes).  I have some of the hacked NROM and GNROM games and all of them work (20 or so disks).<br /><br />Doctor 6M is coming (thanks, Tomy) and as soon as it arrives I will add support for that disk format.<br /><br />I would like to say thanks to Kaz for helping to get to these Game Doctor disks working.

Metroid 1.2 loaded to the menu screen but the whole screen was yellow. Will continue testing it a bit more. This is definitely one of those devices that gets touchy over USB ports, kinda like my Kindle2.
