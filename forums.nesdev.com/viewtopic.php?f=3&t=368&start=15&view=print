<br />At boot, after 1 frame, the frame IRQ line is set, then it writes 0 to the frame sequencer, and one frame later, it writes 0x80 to it. It never acknowledges the frame IRQ.
<br />
<br />Ironsword locks up at the titlescreen. That happens because it does a PLP that sets the status register to 0. The frame IRQ is finally let through, and it gets stuck in an RTI/frame IRQ loop.
<br />
<br />Cobra Triangle locks up in-game, I don't know yet what it does, but the boot-sequence is quite the same as in Ironsword, so I guess I'm doing something wrong at boot, but I have no clues.

<br />The IRQ line stays hot until it's acknowledged, right ? eg.:

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hap is correct. The only way (I've found) to clear the frame IRQ flag is to read $4015 or write to $4017 with bit 6 set (i.e. $40 or $c0). Writing $00 and $80 to $4017 never clears the flag.
<br />
<br />Darn it, I'm almost done with a first round of APU test ROMs, and this is one of the things it checks. I'm going to have to break the frame sequencer tests into two releases since I've got a great set ready (the complexity due to the delay when changing modes is really overwhelming me).
<br />
<br />What are you initializing the NES RAM to on power-up? Perhaps you're using 0 and the plp is getting that. I recently re-ran the test and got the same result: RAM filled with $ff (except four bytes in zero-page that have different values).

<br />I saw wrong, my debugger is kind of confusing: the PLP gets 0x90, not 0 (the 0x90 is from a PHA a few instructions earlier, stupid game bug I guess). I'm almost certain the clearing of the 'I' flag is correct behaviour, and I've got a bug somewhere related to IRQ handling.

<br />
<br />Something I thought of while searching for the cause of this bug:
<br />If an IRQ is pending, and you do a CLI, or PLP or RTI that clears the 'I' flag, does the IRQ happen after this instruction, or after the next one ?
<br />
<br />Doing it the 2nd-method-way fixes Stars SE.

<br />...
<br />CLI

<br />something1
<br />something2
<br />something3
<br />irq: RTI
<br />
<br />this translates as:
<br />CLI

<br />RTI, RTI, RTI, RTI, etc.
<br />
<br />while this would fix Stars SE:
<br />CLI
<br />LDA..
<br />RTI
<br />something1
<br />RTI
<br />something2
<br />RTI, etc.
<br />
<br />(Yeah, I know, kind of dumb to use Stars SE as a test case, it might not have been tested on a real NES)
<br />
<br />
<br />*edit*
<br />Days of Thunder (U), had what I thought to be a feature where the dashboard shaked vertically when the engine was revved high. That doesn't happen anymore after implementing this irq flag 'edge trigger' behaviour. Other glitches still happen though, like 2 displaced scanlines on the textbox at the gameover screen.
<br />
<br />(the screenshaking problem in Ys III is still there)
<br />
<br />*edit2*
<br />Days of Thunder (U) behaves the same as before after fixing a bug, so ignore the comment about it above.
<br />It might be important to know that whenever Ys III does a shake, a pending IRQ, caused by a CLI, is always involved.

<br />
<br />As I kinda suspected, this broke some other games (ppu statusregister being 0x80 on boot). Could it be something undocumented is happening ? Like the pending frame IRQ fading away somehow.
<br />
<br />If it's not too much work, can it be tested?:
<br />- set interrupt flag
<br />- wait 2 frames, so the apu frame irq flag gets set
<br />- write 0x80 to the framesequencer
<br />- wait a few seconds (in w&amp;w2 the interrupt flag is cleared after about 3 seconds, in cobra triangle when you start the game)
<br />- clear interrupt flag
<br />- frame irq happens ?
