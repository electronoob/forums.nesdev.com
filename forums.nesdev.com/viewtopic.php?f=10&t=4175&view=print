		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, right now I have a Nes Toaster that I put a New  72 Pin connector in with the Gold contacts and Cleaned and Polished my games and I still got to give the Thing a Blow job alot to play my games.
<br />
<br />My next option is my Nes Toploader with the Bars that looks horrible.  I read all 7 pages of the "top loader - getting rid of bad video, lets figure this out!" and got so confused there are like so many guides  but which one to follow. I am poor at reading a diagram but can solder wire easy just need  pictures for each step. Or someone to write me a detailed instruction for each step due to my lack of reading a diagram.  If anyone wants to take the time to PM the info and help me through it I will take all the pictures and Post the Idiot proof Guide to this and put this thing to bed wants and for all.
<br />
<br />Or, my last  option is go with a clone.  The only games I have that would be obscure that might not work would be Death Race, Maniac Mansion, Zelda Outlands Repo, EarthBound Repo.  DO game Genuie work on the clones which one is the Best?
<br />
<br />Well, I have 3 options here.  I just want to play my games with no blowing and no Bars is that too much to ask....<img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  
<br />Thanks all for your Help and rember I will total Appreciate your time to Help me and be sure to payback to the site in some way.
<br />
<br />
<br />Remember - the only dumb question is the question that remains unasked.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The "real" problem is you keep blowing into your games. It's bad STOP IT. The contacts both in the nes and on the game corrode thanks to this making them not work again. I found that usually "reseating" games in a certain way would make them work. With a new connector sometimes the games even work better if they are in "up" position.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you have an original front loader, I've explained in <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4027&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=15" class="postlink">another thread</a> how to modify your cart connector to work relying more on tension. Really, the problem is rarely dirt. It's that the 72 pin connector SUCKS. Try see my explanation on the very last post in that thread.
