Otherwise, the quietest idle value is -36dBFS.<br /><br />Correspondingly, you could either manually edit the source file to go to + or - full scale during silences during the recording (with the understanding that this may add an audible click); you could slice up the file into multiple segments; or you could intentionally add a sound that would be acceptable in the background instead.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The automatic DMC playback can't produce a constant volume level because each bit makes the waveform go either up or down. In the silent parts of your sample you have $55 = %0101_0101. At pitch 8 each bit plays for 190 CPU cycles, so the period of the 0,1,0,1,... waveform is 380 CPU cycles. If you calculate the corresponding frequency, it's around 4500 Hz, well within audible range.<br /><br />One solution is to split the sample into multiple parts, cutting out the silent parts. Then use the DMC IRQ to glue them together (with some delays for the silent parts).<br /><br />EDIT: lidnariq pointed out that silence is possible by saturating to 0 or 127, but that's usually not very practical.

Because there's no way to specify that the wave stays at the same level from one sample to the next, the converter represents silence by alternating between two adjacent levels.<br /><br />When I <a href="http://pics.pineight.com/nes/breakingthelaw.nsf" class="postlink">covered &quot;Breaking the Law&quot;</a> for Famicompo Pico 2015, I wrote a program in Python that would identify silent parts of the wave, cut them out, log the start time and length of each remaining segment, and pass them to a delta modulation encoder. This not only eliminates granular squeal but compresses each run of silence to just a few bytes. Then I rigged up a short player program that ran alongside Pently (my music engine) and played the samples at the appointed time. But integrating that program's output into your own program might be an issue. How are you planning to play these samples? In an NSF using FamiTracker's engine or otherwise?

She says only one sentence with four words without a pause. And you still hear the noise throughout the sound.<br /><br />Just listen to the file in the attachments: It's a constant cheeping from start to finish, not just a replacement for silence.

It is <em>not</em> the substitution for silence.<br />Therefore, any solution that is based on splitting the sound into different parts brings me absolutely nothing. Because the noise is a high-frequency sound that is played throughout the whole file. It is in the background of every word, not just in the pauses.

And if using a higher sample rate causes your program to overflow 32768 bytes of PRG ROM, then use a mapper other than NROM to gain more space in $C000-$FFFF.<br /><br />Accept the noise, use a mapper, or optimize other parts of your program for size. It's an engineering tradeoff.<br /><br />You mentioned quality 13. If you are willing to optimize other parts of your program for size in order to allow use of quality 13, I will perform additional tests to see what can be done to reduce noise in non-silent segments assuming quality 13.

DPCM is a very primitive codec dating back to 1950, and I imagine that Nintendo chose it because it could be implemented in the 2A03 with few gates while not infringing any patents that subsisted as of 1983.<br /><br />An audio codec could be created that gives quality equivalent to DPCM quality 15 at a much smaller size for voice signals. But then that would involve &quot;specific program code&quot;, and it'd take nearly 100% of CPU time to play. You said earlier[1] that you don't want programming help on this project unless it's a preexisting library. I have some ideas on how to make a low-bitrate voice codec with a player library for the NES. But unfortunately, I haven't yet got around to it, and I am currently occupied with another paid project.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">[1]Private communication, early December 2015</span>

I need that room for actual gameplay stuff and of course for the sound sample itself. In the moment, the sound is merely at quality 10. More stuff in the game means an even lower quality. So, yeah, I still hope to find a solution for this without having to include new dedicated code.
