<br />Yes, VRC6 and VRC7 konami boards use JEDEC pinout ROMs.  This means you can socket the board and drop an EPROM in there directly with NO rewiring.   There is one little minor caveat though.
<br />
<br />I modded a madara in to CV3 and it worked fine, except graphics and sound were hosed.  This is because konami swap A0 and A1 on the mapper!  So if you make this kind of cartridge, be sure to flip A0 and A1 going to the mapper only (do not flip it going to the ROMs). I did this by cutting the two routes and adding wires.
<br />
<br />
<br />Seems alot of japanese famicom boards use JEDEC style ROMs.  I think they changed it for the US releases to deter reverse engineering or something.
<br />
<br />The CHR and PRG ROMs have different pinouts even on US/euro NES carts, which I have never ever been able to figure out.  Only thing I can think of is it was done to make REing difficult or something.
<br />
<br />(Also the NES cart edge is on a 2.5mm spacing, instead of .1" which is 2.54mm... I also suspect this was done on purpose to make american made carts unreliable if they used the .1" spacing)
<br />
<br />The famicom has .1" spacing in contrast.

According to bootgod's database, weird boards like SL1ROM or so only exist in US, never in Europe. Same goes for 3rd party boards such as NES-BTR or the Acclaim or Konami boards.<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure, but I guess Famicom carts made by Nintendo are like the NES carts by Nintendo, they have their pinouts shuffled in the same way. I currently only have one FC cart so it's hard for me to say a rule based on this.<br /><br />And I think most non-Nintendo carts uses standard (JEDEC) pinouts because they couldn't afford making special custom made maskrom, altough Konami or Namco could probably have afforded that if they really wanted.<br />The puropse may have something to do with reverse engineering, but also they could make smaller chips for 128kb (28 pins instead of 32) by routine /OE and /CE to the same pin. Also Wizard &amp; Warriors II cartridges uses a pin for a positive CE in order to avoid bus conflicts, which couldn't be done without extra logic on a JEDEC pinout.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">(Also the NES cart edge is on a 2.5mm spacing, instead of .1" which is 2.54mm...

<br />Yes I've figured that out and I almost was gotten. After multiplying the spacing by the amount of pins I got a large error tough. I had to use a big zoomer (is that how is it called in english) to figure the truth.

<br />Thanks for confirming the information, I really appreciate it.  Somehow, I kind of had a feeling that you knew about this since you reverse engineered the VRC-VI/VII 9 years ago(?). But I didn't want to bother you directly with this since it seemed such a simple thing and I could figure it out myself if I put some effort into it.  I'm happy that you confirmed it.
<br />
<br />Regarding the swapped A0/A1, it won't be an issue for me since my goal it to do dev with this mapper (I'm a Konami nut and I have to try something on their how custom mapper).  If I really want the other games, I guess I can find them easily since I'm in Japan and Akihabara is on my way to work.
<br />
<br />Thanks again to confirm the information <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
