Yeah, just thought I'd mention it in case you had any lying around. Any developer that worked with Nintendo would have been told to listen for D1 in their controller read code for Famicom expansion controllers, but outside of Japan it wasn't necessary, and if you were an unlicensed developer you might have had no way of knowing about it.<br /><br />Battletoads US doesn't do it, but they later made a release in Japan that does (with modified levels too, one of the few cases where the Japanese version is actually the easier one). Solar Jetman doesn't, and never had a release in Japan. I think the Codemasters games have this problem too. Can't remember any more examples offhand.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Tue Mar 03, 2015 11:09 am</p><hr />

If you get yourself a flash cart I'd be willing to give it a try for you, and others here might be willing if I were unavailable by then. It will probably take a few tries, since we can't really test it on an emulator.<br /><br />2. Yes, if you wired the powerglove directly into the wired controller port, it should just work. (In theory.) The NES has two extra pins on controller 1 (D3 and D4) (<a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Controller_port_pinout" class="postlink">pinout</a>) that the Famicom didn't have, but almost no controllers use them, and I don't think the powerglove does either, so it's largely not a problem.<br /><br />If you look for &quot;NES extension cable&quot; you can find a cable with a female/male NES controller connector that would be easy to use for this. Just cut the famicom wired cables in the middle, and solder them up to the ends of the extension cable.

Ah ok I see thanks for the clear explanation, so realistically how likely is it that someone on here will be willing and able to attempt to do this?<br /><br />also as another option how possible would it be to take a famicom extension cord and wire it into the player one control input to allow the glove to plug in as controller 1? would that even work?

If you've got something like an Everdrive or PowerPak it's really simple, otherwise you'd need to burn an EPROM and solder it into the cartridge.<br /><br />We might need to know about the adapter you're connecting the PowerGlove through. Does it connect all the data lines from the NES controllers, or does it just connect the controller's D0 to the famicom expansion port's D1? (Do you know what kind of adapter it is, have a schematic, or a multimeter to test it with?)<br /></div><br /><br />Wow! that'd be great if someone could, i'm sure i can borrow an EverDrive from someone, i know a few people with them.<br />The Powerglove is connected directly to the Famicom as per the out of the box setup, as the Jap version simply has a Fami expansion plug on the end instead of a NES plug (all versions of the the glove itself have a standard Genesis/Atari style connector which goes into a little box which is attached to the sensors and then plugs into the console via the expansion port for Fami or controller port 1 for NES) so i'm not using any kind of extra adapter. the only adapter i'm using is to allow the 72pin Super Glove Ball NES cart to be fit the 60pin Fami cartridge port, hope that helps, massive thanks for your help so far<br /><br />edit: in basic terms im assuming the problem is that Glove Ball is looking for control inputs coming from controller port 1 but on the Fami controller port 1 is always a standard controller while the glove connects via the expansion port, so essentially we want to tell the game ROM to stop looking at controller port 1 and look at the expansion port instead<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6910">ReplayRetro</a> — Mon Mar 02, 2015 12:50 pm</p><hr />
