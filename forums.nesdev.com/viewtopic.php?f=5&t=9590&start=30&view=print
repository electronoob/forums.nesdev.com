But then you'd have to contend with a scrambled palette (Duck Hunt and Tennis, the games using the standard PlayChoice PPU, have been picked over by people who want to RGB-mod their NES) and the short play sessions typical of coin-op.

The first time I saw the option in the config menu I literally said &quot;What the fuck?  They can't be serious...&quot;<br /><br />BTW, haven't read the rest of the thread, and I did laugh at the initial proposal ( :-) ), but rotating a CRT monitor isn't a wise idea anyway unless you can degauss it shortly after -- by rotating it it messes up the magnetisation aspect, often resulting in discolouration (sometimes the damage can be permanent).  <a href="http://www.repairfaq.org/samnew/tvfaq/tvtiltpic.htm" class="postlink">Nope I'm not crazy</a>.  This is one of the many reasons why arcade cabinets with CRT rotation support have degauss buttons (I own a CANDY 25 cab and had a Taito Egret cab as well, so I'm aware of the importance of degaussing).<br /><br />If I remember right, there were also reasons to try and have your CRT always facing some particular direction -- had to do with north vs. south pole alignment -- and if you ever changed it (i.e. if it was previously facing north but was relocated and now faces east) you were supposed to degauss it.<br /><br />Obviously this complexity doesn't apply to LCDs.

Also, it is understandable if a system tuned up for one position can be detuned by rotating it, but I have doubts that a system that was initially tuned up for 90 degree orientation will have some speical problems that would require special tech solution compared to another orientation.

Some CRT computer monitors, such as many models of Sony Trinitrons (very popular in the 90s), definitely had both -- most of the ones I'd used or seen would degauss on power-up (you could tell because of the &quot;thwong&quot; noise they'd make).

Of course, this comes from a guy who has owned 4&quot;, 9&quot;, and 13&quot; TVs, so I'm probably not a very good candidate to make an authoritative statement.<br /><br />However, I do remember a few friends of mine having larger TVs (30&quot;) back in the mid-90s which after being exposed to badly-shielded home stereo speakers (i.e. magnets) had to be degaussed manually due to massive discolouration and warping along the sides of the CRT.  Power-cycling did nothing and there was no degauss button.  Luckily a fellow student had a degaussing coil and would either loan it to people he trusted or would just go to their houses to degauss their TVs.

I bet a mirror could even be used to overlay more colors!  Think what they could have done with mirrors instead of those silly 16-bit PPUs.

Ones with failed posistors though, that's something I have come across, rendering the degaussing circuit unusable.<br /><br />While an LCD does not face this issue relating to color purity, common peasant-grade LCD panels will suffer serious quality issues seeing as most popular computer displays right now are TN panels.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Every LCD panel has problems right now: dead pixels, lit pixels, IPS glow, viewing angle issues, lighting bleed, bad lighting uniformity, backlight buzz (audible buzzing), colour quality issues, banding or sharpness issues (hard to explain tersely), ghosting, response time, anti-glare coating problems (not all matte and glossy coatings are the same), cost, return policies, and a few others I'm not going to get into (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07-VMHUYDmg" class="postlink">crap like this</a> -- nice QA!).  All of these independently are affected by panel type (TN vs. IPS vs. MVA vs. PVA vs. PLS -- and many of those have sub-types, i.e. S-IPS, E-IPS, H-IPS, S-PVA, etc.).  My point is that the list of issues is quite literally never-ending.  Sure, CRTs have their share of issues too, but most of those pertained to bowing/trapezoid/shape issues, dot pitch, and sometimes refresh rate.  The LCD dead/lit pixel issue and how manufacturers justify it still chaps my ass to this day -- <strong>the entire point of a monitor/display is to show all the visual data (pixel) sent to it across the wire</strong>.  Failure to show that data, to me, is a defective product.  Instead consumers are being taught to &quot;expect some degree&quot; of failure -- it's like they want people to believe LCDs are the display equivalent of JPEG (lossy compression).  Utter fucking nonsense.<br /><br />And don't get me started on the fuckwadery that is <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6482/lg-29ea93-ultrawide-display-missing-its-target" class="postlink">shit like this</a>.<br /><br />The only LCD displays I've seen that are utterly amazing are the ones used in Vewlix arcade cabinets -- which you practically have to take out a bank loan to afford.<br /><br />While I'm ranting I am absolutely sick and ired of the 1080 pixel fixation that has no justification whatsoever (I repeat: <strong>no justification</strong>.  For example my 1920x1200 monitor is 16:10, but oh my god, imagine that, every DVD player including MPC-HC shows the movie in the correct aspect ratio!  OMG, math is too hard, let's just use 1080 everywhere, nobody needs those extra vertical pixels.  It amazes me that people given even a slight fuck about &quot;black bars&quot; on the sides or top of a display during full-screen playback.  Am I the only one who remembers first-gen plasma and LCD TVs which defaulted to <strong>showing white instead of black</strong> when doing proper aspect ratio scaling?  Yeah, I remember the justification, and boy that really caught on didn't it?).<br /><br />And don't get me started on the fact that DPI on desktop displays is utter shit compared to things like handheld devices, and again, for no justified reason.<br /><br />OLED and similar technologies, at affordable prices, just can't get here soon enough.<br /><br />I say all this while happily using a Dell 2407WFP (revision A02) LCD, which sadly is a power-hungry bastard due to its older backlighting (CFL), and its response time is ass (effectively something like 40ms due to the crappy/laggy display chip they're using).  I tried a Dell U2412M (LED backlit) a couple weeks ago and it looked perfect and had significantly less ghosting/latency... except for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY59cBbOG78" class="postlink">this bullshit</a> (IPS glow) which, even in a well-lit room, made reading any text/data in the corners (roughly a 5-inch area) impossible.  How does this shit get past QA?  Otherwise the monitor was beautiful, but even viewed head-on that glow made the thing look like shit.  Seems overall I'm going to have to stick to PLS or S-PVA panels exclusively (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33H7AnoAXEs" class="postlink">here's a nice comparison</a> between PLS and PVA), but I can't justify spending that kind of money right now.  I paid US$650 for my 2407WFP many years ago when they came out, and I'm very lucky I got the A02 revision (since A01 had massive problems, and A03 and A04 introduced insane banding issues -- the only issue the A02 has has to do with some red/pink or green &quot;trails&quot; when panning/scrolling certain text/colours, and that can be worked around by choosing very specific RGB values in the colour temp OSD).<br /><br />P.S. -- It's your fault for bringing LCDs into the discussion.  Look what you did!  :P

Since this is a Commodore monitor I mostly use it with my C64. The bright blue background of the C64 basic interpreter causes this issue. On the very top of the picture there are bright lines, almost white, but still a little blue-ish.<br /><br />I'm really no expert with this, but is there a way to fix this easily? I'd hate to make it worse or break the monitor by accident.<br /><br />I guess this probably happened when I brought the monitor to my place. I bought it from a guy who doesn't live that far away, so I just carried it home myself. Didn't know that this could cause problems...
