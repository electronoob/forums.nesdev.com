<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I can't even use NESASM or PCEAS without trouble and compatibility issues,<br /><br />What about making a ASM6-compatible PCE assembler and upgrading your PCE Projects, That would make it so you can use SMBDIS as an upgrade!<br /></div><br /><br /> I use specific PCE opcodes and address modes that the 6502 just doesn't have, to get a little more speed from the backend/emulation library. I could have written the emulation code in pure 6502 for the PCE and used pretty much any compatible assembler, but there isn't any advantage in doing that  - that I can see. PCEAS works fine for me and others in the scene, so I have no plans make or use another PCE/TG16 assembler. For the time it takes to write a "better" assembler, and from scratch no less, I could be doing something else that's more enjoyable to work on <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><br /> I hope you don't missunderstand, I have no source code for Megaman or any of these projects. I'm just simply assembling over the original binary to convert the port read/writes to JSRs. The emulation itself is source code, but that's irrelevant. The game code has no idea it exists and thinks it running on the original platform. It's not like using the SMB 1 source code to rebuild the game for PCE. It's nothing like that at all.<br /><br /> And in that respect, you can hack the rom as if it were on the NES platform. Well, taking into account there's 16k of code/data at the beginning of the binary that now offsets the rom by that much. And that's why I making the 'upgrades' as a layer that would be part of the NES. As best I can. So on a hacking level, it would be more like hacking an NES game rather than writing specific PCE code and specific pce hardware interfacing (which a NES asm hacker probably isn't really familiar with). It doesn't give you full access to the PCE hardware/advantages. If that's what someone needs, then they need to write the game (engine/simulator) from scratch. That's not to say you can't at least have <em>some</em> nice benefits though. I have a build of Megaman that has hooks for the music routine, and plays Red Book audio instead. Sound FX still PSG, but I had planned on adding ADPCM support for them too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />But anyway, very cool project! I dunno if I like the new MM sprite, but it's okay I guess.

I can't even use NESASM or PCEAS without trouble and compatibility issues,<br /><br />What about making a ASM6-compatible PCE assembler and upgrading your PCE Projects, That would make it so you can use SMBDIS as an upgrade!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=287">Hamtaro126</a> — Thu Jul 28, 2011 6:34 pm</p><hr />

Makes it easier to hack the original game routines/code. In the MM1 example, I only started upgrading Megaman sprites (32x32, 15 color frames). I was also adding some 'dma' like modes (just subroutines) that would copy the extra pixel information to the extended bit planes or normally unused palette data entries. I figured, keep it like it's add on feature of the NES - keeping the PCE layer invisible. I dunno. I figured it would be easier if anyone else was going to change such maps/tiles/sprites.<br /><br /> Note: Using any of the upper palette slots results in the sprite flipping to be based on a 16x16 sprite cell, not 8x8 (which normally get's offsets added to get flipped correctly since PCE doesn't support 8x8 sprite cells).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3645">tomaitheous</a> — Thu Jul 28, 2011 4:23 pm</p><hr />
