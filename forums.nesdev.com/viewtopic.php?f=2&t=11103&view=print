It's called Balloon Trip, and it was released soon after the launch of the Famicom.<br /><br />Splashy Fish is a clone of Flappy Bird, which is a clone of Piou Piou, which is ultimately a clone of SFCave. I don't know to what extent SFCave was inspired by Balloon Fight.<br /><br />I'd make something, but I'm tied up with other projects at the moment.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />With the commodore 64, the way graphics and the machine works are extremely different from the NES, despite both machine having a 6502 and being designed arround the same time.<br /><br />The commodore can have 8 sprites per line, but the sprites are 24 pixels wide, and it's possible to stretch them for 48 pixels (the texture is duplicated for two consecutive columns (or 4 columns if a multi-colour sprite is used)), so it's possible to have 8*48 = 348 pixels of sprites in a line, larger than the standard 320 pixels of resolution the machine have after the borders are removed !<br />So it's easy to have more than 100% sprite overlay without any hardware trick, something not doable on the NES, if there is no other sprite at all on that line and if a detailed texture is not required.

Metal Storm does the same thing. But it would end up eating a fair chunk of CHR data depending on the size of the scrollable area. I guess it wouldn't too bad. It would probably be possible to use CHR-RAM for this as well, but it's probably not worth the effort.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since various people brought up CHR switching to fake parallax scrolling...<br /><br />Would it be possible to design a custom board, or mapper, that makes bankswitching BG tiles much more suitable for a parallax effect?  Of course it's more effort and costly than it's worth, but I wondered if you could have a custom board do stuff like that.  Bee 52, which uses a UNROM clone, does that pretty well with the clouds going behind some of the scenery.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There's not much more a mapper can do to help parallax scrolling besides offering CHR bankswitching in small chunks, which most of the more complex mappers do.<br /><br />Well, I guess that something MMC5-like that expanded the capabilities of the name tables and used special tile indexes to indicate the visibility of a second scroll plane, which would have its own tile map and scroll values, would help a lot with complex parallax effects. That sounds terribly complicated to implement though, and you'd still have color problems because the tile attributes would be aligned to the foreground layer.
