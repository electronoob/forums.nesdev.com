<br />1.
<br />
<br />#04 = Decimal 4
<br />$04 = HexaDecimal 4
<br />#$04 = HexDecimal 4
<br />
<br />They all equal the same.
<br />
<br />2. My answer above should answer that (and some other answers to). If you're referring to the Decimal flag being set then they would all mean Decimal by default.
<br />
<br />3. AND clears bits. Example;
<br />
<br />A = $51;
<br />Byte = $42;
<br />
<br />A = A &amp; Byte
<br />
<br />A = $40
<br />
<br />A equals bits that were present in BOTH A and Byte. In this case just the $40.
<br />
<br />5. The number that follows the ROL is how many times the Memory/Register is shifted. Example;
<br />
<br />A = $67
<br />
<br />(0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1)
<br />
<br />ROL $02
<br />
<br />A = $9C
<br />
<br />(1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0)

<br />
<br />ROL $02 will rotate left the binary value at location $02. Rol #$03 is an invalid opcode, since it is impossible to rotate a constant value, huh. Rol always do ONE shift.

<br />
<br /># = identifier for Immediate mode.  LDA #$00  will put the actual value of $00 inside of A.  LDA $00 (no # symbol) means Zero Page mode, which will read from address $0000 and will put whatever is there in A
<br />
<br />$ = identifier for hexadecimal numbering
<br />
<br />LDA $00  is the same as LDA 0
<br />LDA $0A  is the same as LDA 10  (10 decimal = $0A hexadecimal)
<br />
<br />LDA #$0A is the same as LDA #10
<br />
<br />
<br />2)
<br />
<br />The '$' symbol prefixed before a number indicates that the number is in hex.  Likewise there is the '%' symbol for binary.  Lack of any symbol usually defaults to decimal.  ie:   "LDA $80"  is the same as "LDA %10000000" is the same as "LDA 128"
<br />
<br />Binary coded decimal (BCD) can be several different things.  Somtimes it's where each digit of a byte represents a decimal number and not a hexadecimal number.  For example $99 would actually be ninety-nine (99 decimal, $63).  However doing math in this method of numbering is not supported natively by the NES, so games typically don't use this ever.
<br />
<br />Other forms of BCD are where the game stores each digit of a large number in it's own byte for ease of drawing later.  For example if the player had a score of 5623 points, the game might keep it in the following manner:
<br />
<br />05 06 02 03  &lt;--- each digit in its own byte.
<br />
<br />This method is pretty common in many games.  You'll be able to recognize it by how the code handles the numbers.
<br />
<br />
<br />3)
<br />
<br />AND works similar to ORA and EOR.  I explained EOR in another post.  AND is very similar, but works with different logic.
<br />
<br />0 AND 0 = 0
<br />0 AND 1 = 0
<br />1 AND 0 = 0
<br />1 AND 1 = 1
<br />
<br />Therefore $63 AND $46 would result in $42... because:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">$63=%0110 0011<br />$46=%0100 0110<br />--------------<br />$42=%0100 0010<br /></div>
<br />
<br />LDA #$63
<br />AND #$46  ; A now contains $42
<br />
<br />AND is typically used for "masking out" bits.  Or flipping off certain bits.  For example, if you're only interested in a specific bit of a value, you could AND the value with that bit to turn off all other bits, leaving just the bit you're interested in.
<br />
<br />
<br />4)
<br />
<br />ADC performs addition.   ADC #$03  will add 3 to whatever is in A.  It may also add an additional 1 if the C flag is set before ADC is executed.  Also note the difference between "#$03" and "$03", as one is immediate mode and the other is zero page mode (see my response to your first question)
<br />
<br />5)
<br />
<br />ROL "rotates" bits left 1.  This works similar to ASL, only the carry flag is used for the bit that gets shifted in.
<br />
<br />"ROL $02" uses Zero Page mode.  This means that whatever is at address $0002 will be rotated left.  A and other registers (except for the status flags) are completely unaffected.
<br />
<br />"ROL #03" is impossible, as you cannot use immediate mode with ROL.
<br />

<br />Considering he's been in this forum for well over a month, asking about various other aspects of NES programming, and he's just NOW asking about the absolute <strong>basics</strong> of 6502 assembly, I can understand why WedNESday is laughing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree with Disch, I don't think there's a need to be a jerk. But I do think there's a need to point a newbie in the right direction. I think it's also the newbie's responsibility to go in the direction someone is pointing them. I started out NESdev not even knowing what a byte/bit was, didn't know how to use the command prompt, and when I arrived here, I didn't even know people made NES ROMs. I did not know what I was doing for like 6 months. Now I know exactly what I'm doing. 
<br />
<br />So just because he doesn't know what those mean after like a month doesn't mean he won't get it eventually. It's like a line of people climbing a mountain. Just because you get to the top doesn't mean you get to throw rocks at people still climbing. I'm sorry, I just thought I'd share my opinion about that.

<br />I guess I just see more of where he's coming from.  Most tutorials don't really get into details of how all that stuff works, they just show you some example code and loosely explain it.  For someone with no prior experience it's hard to know which things to learn first.  Or even how to learn them.
<br />
<br />Besides -- <em>even if</em> you see the situation as WedNESday does (which I can, and even do sometimes).  Being a wiseass and mocking him to his face like that is juvenile.  And what's more, when I called him on it, he turns around and does the same thing to me -- like he's TRYING to start a big drama-fest.  I'd expect that kind of behavior at a place like Acmlm's board, but here I guess I just have a higher expectation of the board members.  There's always a show of modesty, tact, professionalism, and willingness to help.  None of that "ha ha you're a stupid moron for asking this and because of that I'm better than you" crap WedNESday peddles day after day.... we can live without that.
<br />
<br />I really don't want this place to turn out like that.  If everyone here acted like WedNESday, this place would suck.  Even now as I'm posting this I'm realizing how big of a drama queen I'm being -- which ironically is the exact thing I'm trying to avoid.

<br />Then <strong>don't</strong> answer them; it's not your job to decide who is and who is not worthy of writing an emulator or even asking a question. Excuse me for saying, but you really do a good job of looking like an arse in these forums, especially to those who have watched the entirety of your prior sophomoric antics.
