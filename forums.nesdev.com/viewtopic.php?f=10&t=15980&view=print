From there you can follow what the readme says.  Presumably it needs to have that &quot;Multicart.nes&quot;, and the NES file you're adding in the same folder (though you could probably put a full directory path with the filename as the command).

From 11 games only two is working. Although, the rest of the game NROM too and also should start.

If there is an updated version - let me know.
