You'd think that if you started the same sample at the exact same time every time, that an IRQ would fire exactly the same number of cycles later every time, right? You'd be wrong. The APU has its own rhythm and as far as we know there are only 2 ways to use it for raster effects:<br /><br />1- Have the IRQ fire a safe number of scanlines (a number larger than the maximum error) before a sprite 0 hit or sprite overflow that will be used to properly sync the CPU with the display.<br /><br />2- Set a preliminary IRQ and measure how long it takes for it to fire (wasting CPU time), so you can measure the error and compensate for it (wasting more CPU time).

I think the APU is very deterministic?<br /><br />The primary problem with it as an IRQ timer is that it has a very coarse resolution. You can only change the sample length in 128 sample (16 byte) increments, and there are only 16 available samplerates. This makes it rather difficult to choose a sample-length + speed combination that lands where you want it, but once you choose one it <em>should</em> fire in a rather predictable location. (<em>edit: lidnariq explains why this won't work, below.</em>)<br /><br />Picking an arbitrary scanline would be difficult. (Probably would require a lookup table of sample length + speed + extra CPU wait time?)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I won't pretend I know a lot about the internals of the APU, but from trying to use DMC IRQs for scanline timing I realized IRQs simply won't fire a constant amount of time after you set them up. They'll vary by several scanlines, and I can only assume this is because the APU has its own pipeline of operation, much like the PPU repeats the whole process of generating video frames over and over. Think about the PPU: if rendering is off and you turn it on, the PPU doesn't immediately start a new frame just because a register was written to... the PPU will finish the current frame, and only then it'll start a new one, because the chip was made that way. I can only assume that something similar happens inside the APU, it does things in a certain order and will only start playing samples at certain times.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I think the APU is very deterministic?</div><br />Oh, I'm sure it's quite deterministic in its own isolated universe, but it runs in parallel with the PPU while not in sync with it in any way. The CPU can sync with the PPU though NMIs or the status register, and it can sync with the DMC channel by waiting for a DMC IRQ to fire, but in order to use APU IRQs for timing raster effects, you kinda have to sync the CPU to both of them, and that's the hard part.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The primary problem with it as an IRQ timer is that it has a very coarse resolution.</div><br />I wish! If this was the case I would long ago have assembled a table with parameters (sample length, rate and padding, like you mentioned) for all 240 scanlines and forever forget the NES doesn't have a built-in scanline counter.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Tokumaru seems to be referring to that the bit phase of the DMC is in a semi-random state when you write to the registers, isn't changed by writing to the registers, and the only way you can know its value it to wait for an APU DMC interrupt.</div><br />Exactly. You can sync with the APU by setting up a preliminary IRQ, and by counting how much time passes until it fires you can tell how &quot;off&quot; the APU is compared to how you wanted it to be. Once you're synced with the APU, you can then predict when subsequent interrupts will fire, but since those will be relative to the &quot;wrong&quot; time when the first interrupt fired, you have to compensate for this error using the difference you encountered when waiting for that first IRQ, in order to find the correct scanline. I never manged to get this working correctly though... I did get a stable enough split that would jitter by up to 4 tiles (good enough for simple raster effects), but every few seconds it would jump several tiles and I never found out why.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Isn't that only true if you're interrupting a running sample?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So many replies <img src="./images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /><br />For the sprite issue, I believe that the off screen sprites are not moved down to the off-screen area correctly (if I even have remembered to do that). I need to check the code once more.<br /><br />For the fire effect discussed, I was planning on using the MMC3's scanline IRQs, because its the easiest method. DMC IRQs are out of question, because the DMC channel is used in music. Another thing about the effect is that every other frame the fire will display and every other the regular forest background. The wobble is only active every other frame, and I wasn't planning it begin very intensive anyway. Another thing I need to make sure is that the stage ends on even screen number, so I can disable the status bar IRQ on the frames the wobble happens, making it a bit easier and decreasing the amount of IRQs required for that frame, since the status bar is drawn on the left nametable. The right one will have the forest background and since there is no wobble for that, the status bar IRQ won't cause any problems.

Since the OAM isn't getting cleared, you get garbage sprites. What you need is some other method to detect when the OAM is actually full.<br /><br />Alternatively, you can simply hide all sprites before drawing any metasprites. It may be a little wasteful, but is conceptually simpler.
