But it wasn't 1983 when the SFC came out - who was using sheets of paper for development or sprite layout??? Doesn't seem very optimal layout for dma'ing or such. Either way, it definitely isn't a clean design like the PCE or MD. Convoluted was a little strong to describe it (I reserve that for other aspects of the SNES, sPPU, etc), so &quot;strange&quot; seemed appropriate.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It is briefly mentioned in the BG layer section of wiki.superfamicom.org, but it is really unclear.  There is some C++ algorithm that I don't understand, but I did notice something about if $2000 is set, apply to BG1, if $4000 is set, apply to BG2.  Maybe it wasn't bit 9 then, I probably misremembered it as $0200, since I haven't used it in a while.  It doesn't mention anything about columns versus tiles.  Maybe it keeps the tile scroll value down until it hits another tile with bit 13 set.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The offset per tile is perfectly doccumented in Anomies' doc, and while it is confusing when using horizontal offset-per-tile, I think the vertical offset per tile is very clear.<br /><br />Normally OPT is column wise, but by changing BG2's vertical scrolling you could make it tile-wise or even less. Whenever BG2's scroll is changed, the first (or is it second?) row that would be displayed if BG2 was displayed determines the OPT.<br /><br />The enable bits should just be set, if they are clear then the normal scrolling applies. If the normal file horizontal scrolling is not a multiple of 8 (i.e. whole tile), the first pixels displays part of a tile using normal scrolling, and then OPT is used starting from the next tile.<br /><br />I really recommend restricting to vertical OPT first, because horizontal is extremely confusing, although it makes sense it's hard to keep track what is going on - my understanding is that it can only be used to re-arrange tiles in a row rather than doing actual scrolling.

The upshot is that if you want to use offset-per-tile on a horizontally-scrolling screen to draw a waterfall or something, you have to use the clip window to mask off the leftmost 8 pixels of the screen or you'll see visible artifacts. This limitation is probably one reason offset-per-tile was mainly used in non-scrolling scenes such as title screens, boss fights, and block puzzle games.

So exactly for the same reason as the SNES you need to hide the first column during column scrolling. I believe later MD revision fixed the problem: the MD2 seems to fix the column 0 offset to 0 (where it was somehow randomly picked on MD1) and MD3 even added an extra VSRAM entry for it (really not sure about it but i read it somewhere).

Ughh. And secondly, why can't documents and sites contain a bit of redundancy in their information? It helps to understand stuff. Looking at what you said, and re-looking over the official dev manual, I can see that <em>now</em>. But even the official documents are crappy in this respect. The example format given for the 'map' (which isn't even a map anymore, it's just a small offset scroll table that just happens to share the same base pointer as BG3 for other modes), doesn't indicate that it's limited to just two rows data. <br /><br /> Now that that's clear, why the hell is Aladdin slowing down for on the snake boss??? That makes even less sense now.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br /> Actually, way before snes wiki site, there was an effect in Chrono Trigger that supposedly offset <em>every </em>tile for some weird transition effect (part of a cinema.. a ship?). I'm not sure who said it, but given the interpretation of the SFX dev manual - the claim made sense. Now I'm curious how that effect was pulled off.

The problem is that it has enough entries for 20 columns (the width of the screen), but because of horizontal scrolling it ends up rendering <em>21</em> columns instead. The column at the leftmost is basically column -1, and because it doesn't have an entry in VSRAM it ends up reading the noise is on the bus instead. This is why games would hide the leftmost 16 pixels when using this mode.<br /><br />At least when horizontal scrolling wasn't used (common in shmups) this issue wouldn't come up since column -1 was completely offscreen.

If you want to fake rotation more feasibly you pretty much need pixel granurality (something which wasn't possible in either case due to VRAM bandwidth issues).
