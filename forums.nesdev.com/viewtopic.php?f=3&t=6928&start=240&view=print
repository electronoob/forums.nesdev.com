		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello everyone!<br /><br />I've recently acquired a Retro Bit NES USB Control adapter + a original NES controller to use for puNES, Gambatte, Magic-Engine etc.<br /><br />It works great for Gambatte and Magic-Engine but not for puNES.<br />The problem I have is that the D-Pad isn't configurable and usable because somehow puNES is super sensitive and all it want to do is to set every button to JPOVF meaning Forward (UP)<br /><br />I have tried changing things manually in the Input.cfg and A, B, Start, Select seems to work OK but not the D-Pad.<br /><br />I'm currently using an original SNES controller along with an adapter from MayFlash instead to somehow get an authentic feel but it's not the same, oh not even close.<br /><br />Unfortunately the NES controller and adapter also works in Jnes but I really wanna move from that emulator because puNES is so much accurate and better.<br /><br />I also tried calibrating the control but it doesn't change anything and every other control I have works just fine in puNES not just the original NES one that I want to use.<br /><br />What can be done about my problem here? I just want to play my games with a real NES controller in puNES so badly.<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #FFFF00">EDIT:<br /><br />I got it to work and solved the problem by using a little freeware JoyToKey program called <a href="http://www.emulation-evolved.net/?q=node/19" class="postlink">J2K - A Joystick to Keyboard Mapper 1.1</a><br /><br />I mapped the keyboard keys in puNES that I wanted to use (A = X, B = Z, Select = C, Start = V, Up = Up Arrow, Left = Left Arrow, Down = Down Arrow, Right = Right Arrow and left everything else blank), then mapped those keys to the corresponding NES controller buttons in J2K, saved the profile and was done.<br /><br />The result was perfect and I'm now enjoying all my NES games with the refurbished original NES controller. So a tip to all of you, if you ever got problems with a controller and an emulator, try to use this J2K program.</span><br /><br />Sorry to have bothered you...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am a big fan of puNES. Currently my favorite NES emulator. I have wondered if you would be willing to open the source for it anytime soon? You could put it on github. There's a lot of benefits to open source. There's been too many promising emulators that never released their code, so they stopped being updated once their creators did. <br /><br />I've heard of users reporting &quot;audio problems at 30ms or less latency&quot;. Have you heard of dynamic rate control? I believe that could fix it. It's a new kind of syncing audio and visuals. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/libretro/libretro.github.com/raw/master/documents/ratecontrol.pdf">https://github.com/libretro/libretro.gi ... ontrol.pdf</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Also, have you heard of libretro API and Retroarch? A puNES port could be very interesting.

I also wonder if you could create a custom GUI for Retroarch which mimics puNES's. That way you could run the &quot;port&quot; with all the added benefits, but from the end-user's standpoint it would appear no different than regular puNES. I have no idea if this is even possible, just an idea I had. <br /><br />Otherwise, you could just add DRC to puNES standalone.
