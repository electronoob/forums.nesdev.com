<br />
<br />I hear that the DPCM "locks up" the CPU. Or am I wrong? Anyways, it's understandable how the quality is so low, with only +1 or -1 as your options with controlling the wave. Also, I can't compress the samples without somehow having RAM located where ROM usually is, which basically = no thanks. That's the one advantage to using PCM in $4011; you can compress the data (and also the quality is better).

<br />Yeah, but it's next to impossible to use $4011 for sound while anything else is running. Like tepples mentioned, you'd have to take a 512-cycle break for the sprite DMA every frame, and that will make the sound weird. Also, in order to keep a constant frequency, there will be very little free CPU time for other operations between $4011 writes, considering that if you use mapper IRQs you'll not only have to decompress the sound samples but you'll also have to setup the next IRQ. Without IRQs it'd be impossible to run game logic, because you'd need timed code.
<br />
<br />Unless you want to freeze the whole program while the character screams, which I think every player in the world will hate. I can't name any games right now, but I'm sure I've played games that froze everything when playing sound clips, and I always hated that.

<br />A lot of games on U*ROM or S*ROM boards do that because they have more audio than will fit in $C000-$FFFF. I can immediately think of Blades of Steel, Bart vs. the Space Mutants, Big Bird's Hide and Speak, and SCAT.

<br />
<br />It may just be insanely difficult to do a programm that stopp so many cycles to write to $4011, likely you would only do a few opperation, write to $4011, etc... and all of it would have to be timed right (altoug if the timing is not *very* exact it's not catastrophic, will just add some noise to the sound that will anyway not be exact). Also it would slow things down dratiscally because the CPU is used to write to $4011 and take a lot of ROM as all loops would have to be unrolled (writing regularly to $4011). In fact it sounds like a nice challenge to me. But I remember writing a programm that does matrix transormation and raster effects at the same time (second version of my Rotation demo) was really a pain.

It breaks operations into short blocks which each last exactly 21 cycles (using a short delay to use up cycles if the useful code is less than 21). Between each block is a call to the routine that updates $4011. If it were just playing a single sample without any rate adjustment, it each block could use a lot more than 21 cycles.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Gauntlet II plays decent PCM samples and uses sprite DMA in gameplay at the same time, using MMC3 IRQs to update $4011 every 3 scanlines.  It seems to write to sprite DMA at every 5.333 frames (it does a pattern of 4, 8, 4), maybe to reduce distortion caused by the DMA write.  However, forcing the game to update sprite DMA every frame doesn't cause any noticeable aliasing.  This could be because the time for sprite DMA (about 4.5 scanlines) is close to the time per $4011 write (3 scanlines).  I used Nestopia to record the same sound sample played with and without constant sprite DMA.  The sample under constant sprite DMA was just 15% longer than the one without.
<br />
<br />WWF King of the Ring also plays decent PCM samples during gameplay, using MMC3 IRQs to update $4011 every 2 scanlines, but it skips the VBlank period.  But they still sound decent.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@blargg : Wow this sure should have been a headache to code.
<br />If I were to do some PCM playing and some playengine at the same time, I'd definitely want to have the programm working completely without PCM (and keep a backup of it), then break everything in pieces of about 100 cycles and do that, altough it sounds really tedious if this is a complete game engine !!
<br />
<br />Now if the NES would be able to play software mixed samples with $4011, play music with normal PSG channel and run a game engine at the same time, it would really have similar sound capabilities as the GBA ! However, the NES is slower, and have less IRQ sources <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /> 
<br />
<br />With an external microprocessor and IRQ source this should definitely be very possible and not even hard (squeedo comes to mind).

<br />
<br />You mean something that interrupts the code, or something that works on its own and doesn't interrupt the game engine (is that even possible?)? Because it would be cool to have something that doesn't interrupt code, like MMC5's multiplier (though that requires writing and reading).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well there is 3 ways it could be possible :
<br />- An external on-cart CPU does the sound mixing and interrupts the main programm in the NES regularly with the IRQ pin to feed $4011 with music data.
<br />- An external on-cart CPU does the game engine logic, while the CPU inside the NES is only used to deal with the PPU, APU and controller input, and does the sound mixing. Some way for communication between CPUs, likely using some interrupts, is achevied to keep everything in sync. That would probably be the most optimal solution but it would be somewhat revolutionary (you get NES dual-core !)
<br />- No external on-cart CPU is used, and a normal mapper is used to fire interrupts regularly. The slow 6502 have to do everything, music logic, sound mixing AND game engine, and that while being inerrupted very frequently for $4011 updates so it can probably not do much even if working at 100%.
<br />- Same as above but without even using interrupts for $4011 updates, would be completely a pain to write. However, if only one sample is played no mixing is needed and this could be possible, altough a headache (that's what I'm saying in my previous poses).

<br />
<br />Don't we all? :P ...but I have to differ here and say that while the RAW PCM playback doesn't interfere with gameplay in single-player mode and even adds charm to it, it can be REALLY annoying in two-player mode because the other player (who isn't getting hit or beating the crap out of an enemy) is paused as well, without warning.
<br />
<br />Then again, Battletoads is virtually impossible in two-player mode anyway. It's when I actually swallow my pride and equip the cart with a Game Genie, because you're lucky to even find someone who'll want to play it for any substantial amount of time even WITH infinite lives enabled. ;)

<br />
<br />It would be awesome to have the second one! It would be awesome to have two programs running at once especially during Vblank! Then again, probably not because $2006 can't hold multiple values and you'd write to $2007 at the same time in both programs and it would be a disaster. But I don't really know how that works, so that might be garbage.
<br />
<br />Having IRQs interrupting the code regularly would make everything super slow, because not only do you move on to the next sample every IRQ and store it in $4011, you have to back up the A, X, and Y registers. What a waste of cycles..

<br />If the same mapper also saves A before an interrupt, you could load the mapper register that holds A instead of using PHA and PLA, saving 4 cycles but using up an extra byte of ROM.
<br />
<br />If it also keeps track of the PC, then (assuming the CPU was running off of PRG-ROM) it could simply disable PRG-ROM, generate a jump, and then turn back on ROM instead of requesting an IRQ.  And when it needs to return, it could do an indirect jump off a mapper register carrying the last PC.  This would save 8 cycles without the interrupt timing and RTI, but use up two extra bytes of ROM.

<br />Registers A, X, and Y are internal to the CPU, and mappers can't see them until the CPU puts them on the data bus with the PHA, STA, STX, or STY instruction. The only way I can see that a mapper can "save" register A is by providing a single byte of RAM where the CPU can STA and LDA, and that would appear more complicated than just requiring the CPU to PHA/PLA.
<br />
<br />Tracking PC also has a problem: how would the mapper distinguish between instruction and data fetches, or between 1-byte and 2-byte instructions, without including the 6502's entire instruction decoder?
