The Atari 800 modifications someone made to an earlier version I posted here included PAL line delay which was necessary for some demos to look right (it cleverly used even scanlines for chroma information and odd for luma, allowing many more colors than the system has. Good to know though; the table-based algorithm wouldn't like that as much.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Have you already replaced the Gaussian with the Bessel filter? That might be the one factor still significant in achieving a perfect TV look.<br /></div><br /><br />Nope. I'm kind of sore about that too, since I attempted a "by-the-book" decoder by generating the NES video waveform at 42 MHz and filtering that down. I never could get the damn luma and chroma filters to work well; the chroma kept getting the blips at the edges of large luma changes, as you'd expect since an amplitude step is made up of many harmonics. Until I can get <em>that</em> working, I probably won't mess with the filter. And like I said, I'm sore on this issue so I'm not really interested in discussing solutions at the moment (even if you have one that works heh).<br /><br />I did make one important improvement to your gaussian kernel, though: ensure that the sums of every fourth point (at each of the four phases) total 0.5, otherwise it will favor one of the Y+I, Y+Q, Y-I, or Y-Q components. I wrote a simple normalization after the kernel is generated that just finds the sums and then scales every fourth sample for each phase by the appropriate ammount. Your gaussian approaches this ideal as it gets wider, but for really small sizes it's off (in my table I'm using a gaussian of width 13, so each side is 6 points). Also, I found that I could vary the width (via the factor inside the call to exp()) and reduce the "echoes" around text, at the expenst of adding slightly more color fringe.<br /><br />I remember what the problem was, I read that the luma spectral components interleve with the chroma components, so you need a comb filter to separate them properly. I'm not at all up on comb filters was overwhelmed by things I didn't understand.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Fri Feb 24, 2006 2:31 pm</p><hr />

I've got the colors very close to what my video capture gives (thanks to some flesh/sky hue warping code from NewRisingSun), but I'm not going to be adding a chroma line delay or low-level noise right now. I think PAL might require this, so if I ever get around to making a PAL filter, this would naturally become available to the NTSC code. I've rewritten the code yet again to build the tables in a clean way and adjust them so you can output to 16-bit RGB pixels without any diagonal stripes in solid color areas, caused by rounding errors getting amplified when truncating to 5 bits per color component.<br /><br />My main goal is to make it fast and usable in an emulator. Going the last mile to make it indistinguishable from video capture is too labor-intensive given the payoff. If I'm going to do something labor-intensive, writing more test ROMs would be more worthwhile. Like NewRisingSun said, the main value of any of this NTSC decoding is for systems that require it to even get the basic pixel colors correct, like the Apple II.<br /><br />I've played it now full-screen 640x480 and it's pretty darn close to a TV, but still has a slightly off look (kind of like how digitized NTSC video looks). On a side note, someone's used the code for Atari 800 NTSC and <a href="http://www.zophar.net/wwwthreads/showthreaded.php?Cat=&amp;Board=general&amp;Number=281864&amp;page=0&amp;view=flat&amp;sb=5&amp;o=0&amp;part=" class="postlink">I wrote a SNES version</a> over the past couple of days, probably to appear in <a href="http://byuu.cinnamonpirate.com/?page=bsnes&amp;bg=7&amp;browser=" class="postlink">bsnes</a> over the weekend.

blargg,<br /><br />Can you fix the mentioned bugs and post links to two new screenshots?  I am eager to see if your emulator can make screenshots that can fool the expert eyes around here that weren't fooled by the first pair of screenshots.  An observable equivalence test has to start somewhere and screenshots seem to be a good objective way to measure.  Once an emulator can pass the screenshot test, then we can debate about what constitutes a better test.  A set of screenshot pairs could be very convincing that this is more important than other types of pixel filters.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=94">Jagasian</a> — Tue Feb 21, 2006 1:57 pm</p><hr />
