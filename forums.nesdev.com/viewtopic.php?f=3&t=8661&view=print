		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />yeah that's a bit of a vague question, but my answer would be all of them. since NMI/vblank timing is based on how many CPU ticks are in one frame, and you can run any opcodes you want during the course of that frame, any of 'em could be the problem. maybe your opcode timings are not the problem at all, but to check that out try blargg's instruction timing test ROMs.

<br />the only caveat of those tests is that they require an accurately working APU frame sequencer.

<br />Im having problem with nmi_suppression test it trows me error #3, 
<br />
<br />anyway i think i coudn't solve it the way i emulating my ppu, my vblank rutine is as:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">while &#40; Ppu.scanline &gt;= 241 &amp;&amp; Ppu.scanline &lt;= 260 &#41; <br />&#123; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;while&#40; Ppu.scanline_cycle &lt; 341&#41; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&#123; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;if &#40;Ppu.scanline == 241 &amp;&amp; Ppu.scanline_cycle == 0&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;if &#40;Ppu.cant_setvblank == 0&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Ppu.on_vblank = 0x80;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;if &#40;Ppu.on_vblank &amp;&amp; Ppu.nmi_onvblank&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SetNmiPending&#40;1&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&#125;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Ppu.scanline_cycle++; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Ppu.ppu_timestamp += 1; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;if&#40; Ppu.ppu_timestamp &gt;= runto&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;return; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#125;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Ppu.scanline_cycle = 0; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Ppu.scanline++;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#125; <br /><br />Ppu.cant_setvblank = 0;<br />Ppu.scanline = -1;<br />Ppu.ppu_timestamp -= 262 * 341;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />This is the end of the frame on my runppu().
<br />How i threah vblank and i think is a mess. No i don't think it. IT IS A MESS, but i cannot find a better way!.
<br />
<br />Note: cant_setvblank is only for detecting error #8 on vblank basic test. Its set just when $2002 vblank is going to trigger.

<br />
<br />Yes it run many.
<br />It emulates mapper 0, UNROM, CNROM, MMC1, MMC3 and AOROM.
<br />
<br />It runs and overall of 90% games (of course, the one that uses this mappers)
<br />
<br />MMC3 emulation is crapy, but it works for most games.
<br />Sprite emulation is not good too. i never understood wiki explication about sprites.
<br />
<br />It emulates sound a little crapy too, but it sounds.
<br />
<br />The code isn't commented at all, and it is disorganized.
<br />If you HAVE THE WILL to review this code  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> i'll preciate it.

<br />if you've got your emu that far along there probably isn't all that much i can help with, but i definitely wouldn't mind having a look at all. i was assuming you weren't able to get games working. many of the other guys here are much sharper with the NES stuff than i am, but i am learning. i've been doing this for a year and a half, some nesdev guys have been doing this since the 90's.

<br />
<br />Anyway as you say there are a lot of people since the 90. 
<br />I started the emu when i registered. I discountiued it a couple of times.
<br />But things have changed since i registered. There was not test roms, info changed and a lot of things.
<br />
<br />Anyway i think is a project i can't handle to much. Im saying maybe im not too good at emulating!!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
