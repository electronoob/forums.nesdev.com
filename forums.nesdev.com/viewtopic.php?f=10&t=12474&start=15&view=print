Actually, most of the time that's not the case for me. But I get what you mean. I guess in this case you'll get the typical &quot;application has been moved or uninstalled&quot; warning, no way around that. But you should know better than to enable shell extensions for an application in a removable drive.

I agree with you. I went to pains to make it portable -- even though it's installed with an MSI which I'll admit doesn't scream portability. But even the dependencies are installed in the folder you indicate...they don't get shoved into the system folders.

Your virtual Windows are there for you. What's the best is you can use savestates <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> however you gotta be careful because it has the same problematics as PSX Memory Card + PSX Save States and SNES Battery Saver + SNES Save States. Long story short, use only one savestate and that savestate is only for when you have to get off the PC quickly and you save your progress quickly like a Hibernation and then continue from where you left off <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br />However, I don't know if you'll find that because I've been messing around with trying to get a Windows emulator for Linux or for Windows that doesn't require admin privileges for installation and that doesn't have trouble with Windows installation CDs like blue screens of death and that it doesn't cause the mouse to move out of the real window while moving in the virtual window... X.X I've wasted so much time on that and never succeeded.
