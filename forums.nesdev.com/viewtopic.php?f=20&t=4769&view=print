	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The LDH instruction is the Game Boy's equivalent of zero-page addressing, faster than the usual three-byte instructions that can address any byte of memory. It is encoded in two bytes, with the second forming the low byte of the address. The high byte is fixed at $FF, so the page is at the end of memory, which is where the I/O registers and $80 bytes of RAM are located.
<br />
<br />The syntax of the LDH instruction is inconvenient when dealing with symbolic address constants. For example, to access NR52 symbolically, one must subtract $FF00 when using LDH (using wla-dx), or define the constant as just the low byte, which makes it error-prone with all other instructions
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; First approach: subtract $FF00 when using LDH<br />.define NR52 $FF26<br />LDH A,&#40;NR52-$FF00&#41;&nbsp; ; LD A,&#40;$FF26&#41;<br /><br />; Second approach: define with $FF00 already subtracted, then remember to add $FF00 when using other instructions<br />.define NR52 $26<br />LDH A,&#40;NR52&#41;&nbsp; &nbsp; ; LD A,&#40;$FF26&#41;<br />LD&nbsp; HL,NR52+$FF00<br />XXX &#40;HL&#41;<br />LD&nbsp; BC,NR52&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; oops, forgot to add $FF00<br />XXX &#40;BC&#41;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; so this accesses $0026 rather than $FF26</div><br />In my code I've been using macros named LDA and STA, which internally do the subtraction. This way, I can always work in terms of the actual addresses.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.macro LDA ; addr<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LDH A,&#40;\1 - $FF00&#41;<br />.endm<br /><br />.macro STA ; addr<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LDH &#40;\1 - $FF00&#41;,A<br />.endm<br /><br />.define NR52 $FF26<br />LDA NR52&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; macro expands to LDH A,&#40;$26&#41;<br />STA NR52&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; macro expands to LDH &#40;$26&#41;,A</div><br />In my opinion, the assembler syntax for LDH should have been such that the address was a normal one that is in the range $FF00-$FFFF, with the assembler dealing with the encoding. This would have allowed code to be unconcerned with the details:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; Hypothetical; NOT how GB-Z80 assemblers work!<br />LDH A,&#40;$FF26&#41;&nbsp; ; encoded as $E0 $26<br />LDH &#40;$FF26&#41;,A&nbsp; ; encoded as $F0 $26</div><br /><br />Am I overlooking something that eliminates this issue entirely? wla-dx includes some automatic usage of LDH, similar to how 65xx assemblers use it when the high byte of an address is zero, but wla-dx requires that the address be of the form $FF00+offset, and I'd rather not rely on a non-standard transformation like this, as lots of my code depends on timing.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LD A,&#40;$FF00+$26&#41;&nbsp; ; wla-dx automatically optimizes this into LDH A,&#40;$26&#41;<br />LD A,&#40;$FF26&#41;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; wla-dx does not optimize this</div>

I guess I can't count how many time I got the "Argument out of 8-bit range" because of that.
<br />
<br />Probably you were supposed to type something like that :
<br />LDH A,(&lt;Adress)
<br />So that only the low byte is taken in account ? This somewhat remembers me Nesasm.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can't believe I missed LDH A,(&lt;addr). Still, it's silly that the assembler syntax doesn't do that implicitly. Then LDH A,($FF24) would work, but if you tried to do LDH A,($1234), you'd get an assembler error. Checking the operands for valid ranges is nothing new; LD A,$1234 will fail, as will LD HL,$12345.
<br />
<br />BTW, wla-dx does convert LD A,($FF00+&lt;addr) into LDH A,(&lt;addr); I just double-checked. It doesn't convert something like LD A,((&lt;addr)+$FF00) though.

<br />Well, it's really weird. What about if you actually wanted a 16-bit LD instruction for some reason ? I guess there is not much reason anyway. On 6502 :
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ldx #$01<br />lda $ff,X&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;Reads from $00<br />lda $00ff,X&nbsp; &nbsp; ;Reads from $100</div>
<br />So there is a difference. Since there is no indexed adressing on the GB-Z80, it's probably assummed there is no reason you want to use LD when you could use LDH.

<br />
<br />I'm actually rather surprised at how much wla-dx is used in the GB Dev forum. But I'm pretty sure for 6502/NES programming, I and like two other people use it. Everyone else seems to use other assemblers. But I never took the time to look for a GB-Z80 assembler, since I had the WLA bundle it was included so I just used that because it was there.

<br />wla-dx is all there is for some processors, so some of us begrudgingly use it. I encounter obscure bugs every day I use it. Working with the source code, it's an awful mess inside, so it's not surprising. I looked at rgbasm and it uses lots of unconventional syntax that looks like asm from 20 years ago, different from all the other assemblers I've used. For example, directives don't start with . as in modern assemblers. I'll have to give it a try, along with TASM (assuming TASM's source is also available).

<br />For WLA-6502 I never encountered such bugs, but there is a lack of features (which assembler doesn't have any ?), for instance it assumes your code is running from ROM and make your life harder if you code for a machine where the code is downloaded to RAM, such as the C64.
