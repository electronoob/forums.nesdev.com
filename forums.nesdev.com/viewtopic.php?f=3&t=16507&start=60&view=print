If I power cycle while this is happening I think I end up corrupting the disk sometimes, and get an &quot;err 32&quot; trying to load after that.</div>That sounds oddly similar to what Pokun mentioned, too.  But I can't really see how the test could be causing it - it does absolutely nothing after displaying the results.  Maybe a bug with the FDSStick itself?</div><br /><br />I feel like writing repeatedly to $4023 has consequences for disk activity, like it's causing the RAM adapter to send signals to the drive in some way. Maybe not important in terms of nailing this IRQ behaviour down but relevant to disk behaviour? It's weird how inconsistent it is, though.<br /><br />Trying to check what the corruption was, I tried to read the &quot;corrupted&quot; disk back using the FDSStick program, and it was only 16 bytes long. (FDS,$1A header + 12 x $00) So... that's strange. Maybe it's just from powering off while it's trying to write?<br /><br />I don't know what the held red light on the FDSstick means. Actively writing? Usually it turns on whenever I press the button, and the green one turns on any time the disk is being read, I think. (Similarly on my other test a few posts back, I'd get a repeating held green light on that one where it just never stops reading?<br /><br /><br />I do notice that in my example I zeroed out RAM, even though I was masking the value from $FA ($4025 write mirror) when applying mirroring to $4025. Maybe this put the disk into write mode? (There's also bit 5 that the wiki says &quot;always set to 1&quot;, which is a direction this violates but I don't know if that's meaningful.) The default value for $FA should be $2E, which is the last thing the BIOS set it to on reset.<br /><br />I should fix my example not to clobber those BIOS variables. I thought I tried to avoid that, but I missed the ZP ones. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

I can power cycle it with no problems at all.<br /><br />So, yeah, I think the disk activity weirdness was my fault, a bug in my example (now fixed). Sorry.<br /><br />I still think weird stuff can happen with the drive when writing to $4023, but seems well behaved/quiet as long as $4025 is properly set back to $2E beforehand? Anyhow, probably not relevant to the IRQ testing.<br /><br />I also tried patching V5 to see if this affected that it hangs with only 1 heart displayed, but it's the same, so at least THAT wasn't my fault. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

Odd that this would matter since it also meant the motor was turned off - hard to see how the FDS could corrupt a disk while the motor is disabled..<br /><br />I'm guessing there is probably a reason for the BIOS to be writing $83 to $4023 instead of $03, but there is no mention of bit 7 in $4023 anywhere, from what I can see.<br /><br />I updated the wiki with the information that was confirmed from these IRQ tests.<br />I might try writing another set of tests for the drive itself (though that will be trickier I'd imagine) - it would be nice to get a solid understanding of all the flags in in $4030/$4032 as well as the behavior of the disk IRQs.<br />I'm guessing the actual timing of the disk read/write operations can't really be tested with the FDSStick, though?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I guess there is still a possibility that the FDSStick behaves differently from the real disk drive and ignores the motor state. Maybe Loopy could answer that.<br /><br />I tried googling in Japanese for more information about $4023 but found nothing that tells us more than the wiki or Enri. I guess information of the FDS is really scarce overall.
