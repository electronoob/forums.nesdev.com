		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah the whole copy nes install never turned out
<br />I tried for hours to get that CPU out and it never did 
<br />i got frustrated and tugged on the CPU and i think it broke one of the through holes
<br />
<br />I re soldered it back on and booted it up    it still works great picture no glitching  but the controller only recognizes the B button now  and the b button appears to controle all of the buttons.
<br />
<br />instead of me continuing to punish a motherboard thats almost as old as i am i would like to give it to anyone that wants free   ill even fedex it to your house free
<br />
<br />Mother board only   no cables or anything  I think the CPU and the PPU are fully intact  just like i said  a broken or shorted trace is possible
<br />
<br />It dosent look too bad  im sure if someone with more skill then me could easily repair the broken trace if they wanted to salvage the entire board
<br />
<br />The board i think is a newer nes revision because when the lockout chip is engaged it blinks green  which i thought was pretty wild  never seen a green one before
<br />
<br />But please only take it if you can do something constructive with it or with the chips in it.
<br />
<br />EDIT
<br />I can probably ship it free international also but id have to double check
<br />Completely free -  Duty and tax free 
<br />Im a Customs broker so dont wory about international issues.
<br />
<br />If theres anything else anyone would like with the board just ask and ill see what i got left over.   I just really hate myself for hurting this thing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wow, what a great offer!
<br />
<br />Hm... I have a broken PAL NES and the most probable cause seems to be the PPU. Now, I'm guessing your NES is NTSC, so I believe that its PPU wouldn't really be useful to me for this purpose (I researched the differences on this forum and they really are big).
<br />
<br />On the other hand, I would really, really like to have a working NTSC NES without spending a large total for the console, shipping and import duty. If fixing it up really is plausible, I'd love to have it. I guess I would need a dash of other stuff such as controllers (unless NES-004E work on NTSC, which I even think they do) and power supply (or at least an NTSC/PAL adapter). I could implant it in my non-working, spare PAL NES casing.
<br />
<br />I would be happy to help with the shipping cost, as I live in Croatia.

<br />
<br />I desoldered using the radioshack desoldering pencil  
<br />it took many many many resoldering and desoldering to get the holes cleaned out  with the exception of 3 or 4 pins that were absolutely stubborn 
<br />
<br />Pin 1  for the audio was the worst   it was ripped out  but it still produces full audio when i fixed the pin
<br />
<br />Im not completely sure whats up with the controller
<br />
<br />i poped in mario 3  none of the buttons worked except B 
<br />
<br />so when i pressed B on controller 1   it changed the curser to 2nd player and started the game
<br />when the game started the D pad does nothing
<br />B still opens the sub menu for items
<br />
<br />controller 2 does not work as far as i can tell because when i changed ports and tried to initate a 2 player battle nothing happened but im not sure if something would happen
<br />
<br />i can sxperiment more if you want   but nothing else seems burnt out on the board    no odd smells 
<br />VERY clean   no rust    the RFU unit is spotless

<br />i would assume removing the CPU to test in another socketed nes would be a proper test for it 
<br />
<br />once its verified the CPU works PCB repair would be in order if needed
<br />
<br />if its just the cpu thats bad then a replacement CPU in the PCB would most likely revive the board   
<br />
<br />the damage to the board was quite minimal  you cant even tell i tried to remove it
<br />
<br />but like i said i diddent have the skills to remove it in the first place
<br />My soldering skills are limited to modchips and adding things  not removing things
<br />
<br />i dont want to damage it further   i would perfer to give it to someone who has to skills to repair it or properly recycle the components in it and use it as a donor board

<br />i will test the cpu in the new mainboard
<br />
<br />
<br />if the  CPU still works ill send it to you
<br />
<br />either way regardless of the fate of this poor misguided motherboard, since im in the customs industry if you want something let me know i can get it to Croatia no problem
<br />
<br />IF you want an NES or something special let me know  im almost positive i get free shipping as part of my perks.
<br />
<br />I can get working main boards for NES NESC for about 15 - 17$ usd
<br />If you want a complete nes  its like 30 - 35$
<br />
<br />Im a Customs Broker for Fedex  As long as theres a Trade networks in Croatia  i can send you anything you want 
<br />
<br />and that goes for anyone here that always wanted to ship international but diddent know how
<br />
<br />i might be crap with solder  but man can i ship stuff
<br />im like a package ninja

<br />Someone donated a PAL NES motherboard to me a while back, and I also went this route, of swapping it out with my NTSC board. <em>All</em> the connectors fit fine, and if you have a PAL NES power supply, it should fit in the NTSC power plug. It's just tedious to swap them back and forth when I want to test on the other system, so I'm trying to find a NES case to put the PAL one in permanently. Since your PAL motherboard is dead, you won't have this issue of course. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />the nes-004e controllers should work fine, don't know about the power supply though as all nes stuff that ends with e that i've seen are some kind of bastards and doesn't want to be compatible with anything else (besides the controller)... in the case of the wall wart, it's the inner diameter thats different... which color is the power supply socket on the nes unit?
<br />
<br />if blue =&gt; will not work, been there, done that <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />if black =&gt; will most likely work (a pal nes wall wart worked on a ntsc unit i had)
<br />
<br />btw I have a spare ntsc nes unit _without_ cpu and ppc for you if you are interested and want to pay for the shipping from sweden for it (as I don't work for fedex <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> )

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have compared the power connectors on the NTSC and PAL NES. The difference is that the PAL one is more picky, as the inner pin is wider. This means that a PAL power adaptor will fit the NTSC as well, but not vice-versa, since the NTSC adaptor is the one that has a narrower plug and will only fit the NTSC NES. So you don't need a new adaptor if you have one for your PAL NES.

<br />Sugam, I can't believe you're willing to do what you've written, you seem like an out-of-this-world philantropist. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> If the mobo CPU works and you send the thing to me AND I can't get it fixed, I'll definitely order a working one through you and keep yours for parts (or send it further along, if you prefer).
<br />
<br />@blargg: Awesome and highly useful tips, I really appreciate them.
<br />
<br />@hyarion: The socket is blue. But I guess that will change, unless Sugam was thinking about giving away the PCB without the modulator/sockets, which I doubt. If it does turn out that way, and the power supply really doesn't work (hope it will, though), I just might need your black-socketed console. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
