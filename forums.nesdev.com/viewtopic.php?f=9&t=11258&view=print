A review I read mentions a &quot;loading time&quot; before a game starts, which probably means the device is &quot;dumping&quot; the cart to memory and then using an emulator to play it.<br />Perhaps this can become a nice dumping-kit if someone hacks it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

So I expect the answer to every one of your questions to be &quot;no&quot;.<br /><br />If it is upgradeable via Internet (which would seem like a sensical thing to do), one would expect it to eventually support homebrew titles as well (if there's enough demand from the users).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A cartridge slot might be enough of a placebo to placate a judge. In the U.S. and other countries with a copyright exception to the same effect as <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/117" class="postlink">17 USC 117(a)(1)</a>, emulating on a device with a cartridge slot is more clearly legal than emulating dumps downloaded from the Internet. This statute authorizes the making of necessary ephemeral copies of a computer program in the process of running it, so long as these copies are not distributed to a third party.<br /><br />I'm just waiting to see how they word the warranty, so that I can see to what extent I can demand repair, replacement, or refund if my carts that work in my NES don't work in this product. The big test case I plan to use is <em>STREEMERZ: Action 53 Function 16 Volume One</em>, which uses a roughly MMC1-class homebrew mapper and supports the Zapper and Super NES Mouse. It's a commercially sold (though low volume) cart, so they won't be able to fall back on a &quot;not intended for use with developer accessories&quot; clause the way they might with an EverDrive or PowerPak.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I guess it's more or less a useless device for homebrew-authors (since we can still run our stuff on emulators on our computers), however I guess things might start to get interesting if people hack this thing for use as a dumper-device (it even comes with an SD-port, for use with save-files normally). I think I read somewhere that it's running on Android bw.

I have an original xbox loaded with emulators that does everything and much more than any retron thing. Very unlikey I would ever purchase one unless it was extremely inexpensive.<br />But if one is opposed to downloading dumps of games, for whatever reason, there is a difference. Maybe if you build/purchase the dumping hardware, connect to your PC and lock down the emulators to only play via that device then it is the same thing.
