It's sorta taking shape right now and I thought I'd post it, get some opinions and stuff.<br /><br />I've also started a few threads here and there to try and get some input. I've had pretty good success. Two Bosses (Plant Woman and Slash Woman) have been enemy requests (not planned). So far they turned out making the game better than what I could have imagined on my own (imho). I think it's because it has forced me expand on what i know as a whole. Well anyway, the download is below. You can use ePSXe to try it, or some other emulator. I also test it on real hardware, a mod-chipped psone, but if i didn't have one, i guess i could resort to the swap trick (i did as a kid...) Anyway, any Comments &amp; criticism would be welcome.<br /><br /><strong>updated 12-29-2015</strong><br />DownloadGame: <a href="http://forum.rockmanpm.com/index.php?topic=6560.0" class="postlink">http://forum.rockmanpm.com/index.php?topic=6560.0</a><br /><br />Youtube   - Glitches  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg0xstPVPGw" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg0xstPVPGw</a><br /><br />Any feedback would be nice.

<br />I've played some NTSC games and they work fine (the console is modded of course), but I don't really know anything about <strong>PS<span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">X</strong></span> so maybe it's not that simple... we'll see. My TV supports NTSC signal also.

<br />My first console I had as a kid, it's probably to me what the NES is to most people here (I only got interested in older consoles at a later age when I was 14-15-ish).
<br />
<br />I think it's the second homebrew I ever see for that platform, the first one being a very simple puzzle game.
<br />
<br />You didn't make the intro movie all by yourself, did you ? I seem to recognise some characters....  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> 
<br />
<br />I didn't try a lot of the game so I can't comment but it looks clean and even contains 3D.... really complex for a homebrew !
<br />
<br />PS : Oh and I agree the PS1 should be called the PS1, or plain PS (after all, the system is called plain "<em>PlayStation</em>").
<br />I don't get where this X letter comes from. PS1 / PS, PS2, PS3, makes sense. But PSX ???!?

<br />PSX was considered as a name for the console for a while, somehow it hung around even though that wasn't the name they used when it finally released.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">A larger sticking point, however, was PlayStation branding. SCEA hated the name and wanted to change it to PSX, a contraction of the project’s codename. “This was actually a huge internal battle, to the point where there was research done among consumer groups,” says Harrison, who, having seen various youth groups reacting badly to the name PlayStation, had his own fears about it. “I remember thinking, ‘Oh my God, the name is bombing and everyone is going to hate it’. I shared the information with Tokunaka-san, and he said, ‘Oh, that’s nothing, you should have heard what people said about Walkman’. And that pretty much ended the debate.” In Europe, at least: the US nevertheless went ahead with early trade promotion, calling it PSX, and had even come up with its own mascot, Polygon Man.</div>

<br />And I use the letters PSX only internet stuff, as I'm pretty sure most people did/do. When I want to play a game with someone, I don't say, "Hey, let's play King of Fighters on the PSX." Just like I don't say, "KOF." I actually say King of Fighters and the Playstation. Just like most people, i suppose, don't go round saying "OMG, look at THAT!" So PSX, to me, is just a quick abbreviation of the word. But apparently it does have some history behind it, as does the abbreviation LAX, i suppose...
