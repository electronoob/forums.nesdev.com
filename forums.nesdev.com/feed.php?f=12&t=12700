Hello!<br />Thank you for your work on this anime intro for Chrono Trigger! I'm really interested in it and wanted to give it a try on my SD2SNES... unfortunately it doesn't seem to work on my console. I downloaded and applied the patch, I tried it on the Bsnes emulator and it worked well. But on the SD2SNES, I have a blurry colored garbage instead of the anime. The sound is OK though. What could be the problem?<br />For info, I have a PAL (French) modded console with super CIC, and I have a SD2SNES with the most recent firmware (0.1.7b).<br />Thank you very much for your help! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7527">Prock78</a> — Fri Apr 29, 2016 6:57 am</p><hr />

&gt; Thereafter, none of my MSU1 games -- e.g. LoZ Deluxe, CT with anime intro, my own audio resume demo -- worked in higan v096 anymore<br /><br />Oh, were the manifests used to rename the files to odd things for support for sd2snes?<br /><br />Shoot, sorry about the trouble. I didn't consider that use case and imagined anyone using higan (and not sd2snes) would be using the program.rom+msu1.rom+track-#.pcm file naming convention.<br /><br />From higan's perspective, I hadn't changed the proper filenames.<br /><br />&gt; But isn't icarus' sole purpose to, well, import your games for use with the higan library?<br /><br />icarus is meant to get games stored in legacy formats into higan.<br /><br />The idea was that MSU1 is already a higan format, and people shouldn't be seeding them as &quot;game.sfc+game.msu+game-#.pcm&quot; ... they should come as game folders.<br /><br />But again, it's hard to justify copying in a huge amount of gigantic files.<br /><br />In the future, I may add some kind of &quot;MSU1 pack&quot; format, that's an archive full of MP3s and such to expand into a game folder. But that's a ways off.<br /><br />&gt; And even if icarus &quot;supports&quot; MSU1 games (though without being able to import them), then why doesn't higan?<br /><br />higan acts like a real SNES. It doesn't try to heuristically figure out what the deal is with a binary blob mess with no context. All of that messy code that has nothing to do with a real SNES is moved into icarus.<br /><br />It's a pain for you guys, but it's an ideological thing to me. ananke and now icarus are my best attempts at a compromise into giving everyone years of baggage and crap and incorrect mappings and support for ZIP archives and external firmware and on and on and on.<br /><br />Essentially, higan's the nice store front with the curated products on display, and icarus is the slaughterhouse where the meat gets made.<br /><br />&gt; No. (See above.)<br /><br />It will if you name the files the correct way. It can't know what files to look for if you don't name them in a predictable way.<br /><br />&gt; MSU1 is, IMHO. As are some old homebrewn S-DD1 video ROMs. Etc etc.<br /><br />I do actually prefer when manifest.bml is used to rename MSU1 audio tracks to their purpose and/or name. Eg &quot;01 - Battle Theme.pcm&quot;, &quot;02 - Ein Fahrender Ritter.pcm&quot;, etc.<br /><br />Might even be worth trying to rig higan to search for &quot;track# - *.pcm&quot; when a manifest isn't present, but I think that'd make it far less likely we could talk ikari into supporting the format :P<br /><br />&gt; My point was: The lack of documentation is a bit painful.<br /><br />Yes, it definitely would help a lot. I don't have the time or patience for maintaining documentation, but that's one area that someone else who wants to help the higan project could easily participate to great effect.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Tue Dec 29, 2015 6:09 am</p><hr />

&gt; I actually got the DSP-1 tech demo working on a non-higan system<br /><br />Now try it with the 96mbit Star Ocean hack; or the 16mbit program ROM Tengai Makyou Zero hack ;)<br /><br />&gt; These two citations are a good reason for your kind of magic: it prevents the header from crashing your emulator due to bad data.<br /><br />The way I look at it, modifying those two bytes means you're not using the original ROM anymore. It's a ROM hack and the data is no longer verified. As a preservationist, I -very- much don't want to encourage this sort of behavior of monkey patching ROMs.<br /><br />Further, I consider the internal ROM header's registration data to be something that should be completely ignored (other than the interrupt vector addresses, of course); because that's exactly how real hardware works. It doesn't matter that the ROM registration is completely invalid: real hardware never even looks at it. And neither should an emulator. But because of the way we dump our ROM images, discarding all the important board layout configuration information, we have to. The database I bundle in higan seeks to restore that information. It's not an ideal solution, but nobody wants to adapt game folders as a distribution model, so it's all I can possibly do.<br /><br />&gt; I had to do a header hack on Rockfall as well, as the title was too long (by one character, even!), overwriting a byte that crashed SNES9X when the ROM was loaded.<br /><br />Yeah, that's a pretty common one. Blatant mistakes like that are why I laugh when people like Nach in the past have told me the registration information was perfect by Nintendo's mandate and could produce 100% perfect memory maps.<br /><br />Upon dumping my US set, it turned out that Bazooka Blitzkrieg has a ROM size of 0x00, and RAM size of 0x08. Obviously they messed up and put the bytes backward, as the game has no RAM, and obviously has ROM. But what was interesting was that all the ROMs out on the internet had the bytes swapped around. Someone 'fixed' the header, so the ROM was not legitimate, but hacked.<br /><br />Lots and lots of prototypes don't bother with the ROM registration header, because the game hasn't been vetted for final approval yet by Nintendo.<br /><br />&gt; It would be pretty cool to see this happen without an MSU1<br /><br />Chrono Trigger's already 32mbit. You don't have space to spare. But even if you put it on a new board with 48mbit, you will <em>never</em> make anything remotely pleasing that tries to mimic the FMV intro with that amount of remaining space, no matter how clever you are. At best, you could get the audio track in there at very low quality, but that's about it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Mon Dec 28, 2015 7:21 pm</p><hr />

It would be pretty cool to see this happen without an MSU1.  I have an idea of how to speed up converting packed format to planar format.  Use an extremely large LUT that takes up 512 kB, with all 65536 combinations of 4 pixels (64kB), for each bit plane (256kB), and shifted left by 4 bits (512kB).  The actual compression itself could be just a combination of byte aligned RLE and LZSS.  Maybe use tile motion vectors to keep memory size down even more.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4383">psycopathicteen</a> — Mon Dec 28, 2015 6:42 pm</p><hr />
