<br />No, now you know the problem thus you can see that it's unsolvable without a lot of work of either A) logging all note commands sent to the SPC-700 (like in the VGM music format), or B) adding a 65816 emulator to an SPC player. A is much preferable, but given that the game's soundtrack can easily be stored in a music format called "mp3", there's little reason to bother implementing it.

<br />
<br />Might as well rip Wario's Woods music into an .SMC file.

<br />MP3 is patented; let's say "Vorbis". Infinite play is no problem, as it supports Ogg tags that could be used to represent the loop starting point. But when you record a Vorbis soundtrack from a game during gameplay, you also record sound effects, or you mute out channels that are "bumped" by higher-priority sound effects. In addition, Vorbis can't be easily tempo-scaled like SPC can, nor does Vorbis efficiently support muting individual channels. In addition, SPC is a heck of a lot smaller than Vorbis. Given the way the SPC700 and its DSP work, I'd recommend a variant of A) that involves finding better ways to convert to tracked formats (e.g. XM or IT) which preserve most of the advantages of SPC and add editability.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The variant A would just track all commands done to the SPC from the 65815, and not effectivly emultating the 65815. So the data would just be a bunch of command that will tell the SPC to play notes. Usual SPC files already are in a state where the command to play the music has started.
<br />In some very basic game music engines, all SPC will be the same with only some pointers different (same samples, same code, same music data, same SFX data, etc...). More advanced sound engines will just share the same code between songs, but swap all music data and samples.
<br />Maybe a new format in the same fashtion than psf/minipsf and gsf/minigsf should be created. We could do minspcs for simpler game engines.

<br />
<br />RAR removes the redundancy decently already. I proposed a similar non-proprietary compressor of mine a while back but discussion never became productive. Considering that this would only affect a few currently-unrippable soundtracks, it's not at all worth the effort to implement in the player and to then rip every soundtrack again, this time with a disassembler and lots of time. Most current soundtracks can't be improved on, since the SPC-700 runs independently; if you added the 65816 code, it'd be doing nothing. For other formats like PSF (I think), there is no option but to emulate the main CPU. There is always a "super-SPC" player available, anyway: a SNES emulator.

<br />Theres also A program I heard about that converts A spc to use on A real Snes It's Dos based and It's called Spc2rom. The rom is in Smc formatt at first.

<br />
<br />Or use a player with RAR/7-zip support. The compression scheme I implemented uses one file for each track, with a separate file of common data (similar to the minipsf format I hear).

<br />But then the <em>player</em> has to unzip the whole file to play one song. A mini/lib setup would have to decompress only two.

<br />
<br />Actually, for a solid RAR (don't know about 7-zip), on average only half the files need to be decompressed. Plus the player can keep the RAR open (bye bye 40MB RAM) to make accesses of the next track much faster. Game Music Box for Mac OS does this optimization (unless you bring another program in front, then it re-opens the RAR when you switch tracks).
