<br />
<br />Yeah I figured you could clock quite a bit more out of them.  I'm getting the impression that no one will be planning to make use of it though.  It would be pretty simple and cheap to provide an over clocking option though if one desired.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You know, the more I think about this the more I think Memblers had it right: let the NES take care of writing the memory. There is a pretty easy way to make a USB cable that will connect to the controller port on the NES for PC communications, and it would be pretty easy to do the same for an SD card.
<br />
<br />Now that I think about it, it's kind of odd to imbed an MCU in the cartridge if you've already got an MPU in the main system. By letting the CPU do all of the writing you also remove the need for muxing and all that.
<br />
<br />Seeings hows you are still in the requirements phase, let me run this scenario by you:
<br />
<br />1. Cartridge boots into a small boot ROM, bypassing the mapper and having access to CHR-RAM (so we only need one boot ROM chip).
<br />2. This boot ROM provides a menu (I can write this) to either boot the current program, load a new program from PC link cable (or SD card peripheral), or load a program into RAM and execute it.
<br />3. The boot loader will need a way to switch the mapper "on" so to speak. This can be done from a program stub running in main RAM, so the exact timing wouldn't be an issue.
<br />
<br />This would seem to satisfy my requirements, and might be a lot easier and cheaper maybe?
<br />
<br />Also, if you can make the boot ROM writable that would be pimp. I could just load a program into RAM to read data from the PC and overwrite the firmware.
<br />
<br />You could even use say a 32KB Flash ROM for the boot ROM and mirror the boot loader into four 8KB pages, and set the top two address lines with dip switches. This would give you some protection against bricking the cart.
<br />
<br />And you could easily replace a fixed-function mapper with a CPLD and provide an interface to it's JTAG port so the boot loader could load arbitrary code on it as well. I think this would over-complicate matters though. But hey, it's your project <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That is an interesting solution.  But I don't know if I see how it's much easier or cheaper.  But ease is relative to skills also.  
<br />
<br />We'd be trading a NES cord (from a $5 NES controller) for a $5 MCU.  However I happen to have a seemingly never ending supply of NES cords so the NES cord would coincidentally be "free."   
<br />
<br />We would also be losing any added functionality that could be gained from the MCU.   But if no one really planned to use it this isn't really a loss.  It would also be a LOT slower transferring everything serially at 2Mhz which means several minutes.  I don't know about how that would relate to you guys.  If I had to wait several minutes vise 10s of seconds every time I flash an MCU for a project I'm working, I would go crazy waiting for everything to program.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I have a feeling I may be wrong about the speed here...
<br />
<br />And I realize you're offering to code all the NES stuff, which would happen to be ALL the coding with this approach.  I guess that would make it "easy" for me but really I'm not doing the work.  I wouldn't necessarily have a problem with that but I'm willing to bet my advisers would <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  However even if they did I could still make a one off with an MCU.  I don't want you guys to make decisions on how to do a devcart based on whether or not it will satisfy what I'm doing for school.
<br />
<br />But I do agree with the NES doing the coding, and I think the whole idea of dual ported memory is beyond the scope of the project.  I've kinda been thinking that for awhile now even though I may not have been voicing that.  Perhaps I should explain better.  The only real reason I was leaving an out for the MCU to directly code the RAM was because it would remove the requirement for me to directly rely on you to code it up.  Not that I think you'd leave me out to dry or anything but If something were to happen it's not like I can just ditch the project once I'm relying on it for graduation.  So for that reason alone I would try to make my customer requirements as lenient as possible saying the That "the memories must be programmed in circuit."
<br />
<br />What I would really like to see is a design process something like this:
<br />
<br />1)Using the basic "unofficial" prototype I already have:
<br />*Design an interface designed to communicate between the MCU and NES.  So the NES.  Then you (or anyone who'd like to pitch in) could start working on some code that would allow the memory to be programmed from an on screen selection.  That would have the MCU feed bytes to the NES that would then be writing all the RAM.
<br />
<br />To take care of the boot rom issue I think we could a chunk or all of the 32 KB of WRAM I already have.
<br />
<br />
<br />*Physically set it up so that all the memory can be programmed by the MCU from the SD card.  The CPLD would be programmed from an external JTAG programmer.  This would allow me to completely test everything out without NES coding.  This would all happen with the NES off or with the reset button held.  I need to program everything somehow at first.  I would also construct the interface for your program to work.
<br />
<br />This also provides me an easy way to program the bootrom you write to the WRAM for the time being.
<br />
<br />+With some clearly defined and thoroughly designed interface we would be able to work in tandem.  You could code while I'm wiring up the prototype.
<br />
<br />I'm hoping this will allow us to better define what how the final interface will work thus making the "official" prototype better.  It will also give us the capability to debug hardware and code separately.  I could make sure my hardware works first before your code starts to use said hardware.
<br />
<br />2)  Now that we have the basics working we could do away with things like the MCU's ability to program all the RAM while holding reset with the second "official" prototype.  
<br />
<br />*Provide EEPROM on the board for boot rom so we don't have to hold reset at power up anymore.  We could allow this EEPROM firmware to be upgraded by the AVR while holding the RESET button on the console but I'm sure this could also be done by the NES as long as we didn't have self modifying code.  It would be safer to have the AVR do this though to prevent bricking.
<br />
<br />*Now we let the MCU program the CPLD. But this might be a little more tricky.  Perhaps the NES should do this I'm not sure right now what will be best.  I might be hard to program logic that's tied to it's own bus there may be bus conflict issues..  I think the powerpak gets away with this since it's an FPGA.   But we'll figure out what's best when we get closer to that point.
<br />
<br />*If people wanted to start writing demos that made use of the MCU we could test this stuff out and make any changes needed.  We might find a better way to program the bootrom or CPLD.
<br />
<br />3) Done with entire design start producing carts for whoever wants one.
