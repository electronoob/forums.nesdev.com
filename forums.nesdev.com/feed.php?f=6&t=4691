Writing regularly to $4011 allows you to play 7-bit WAVs on the NES/Famicom without bothering with extra audio, but unfortunately this typically takes 100% of CPU time.<br /><br />Altough there should be a way to write a normal programm in a maneer so that it can interupt each constant amount of cycles to play the next WAV sample, this sounds extremely tedious to do.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Jan 03, 2009 3:26 am</p><hr />

It's possible to have any amount of external hardware which runs outside of the NES that sort of "adds on" to the capabilities of the NES.<br /><br />Probably the best way to visualize this concept is like the Sega CD and Sega 32X addons to Sega Genesis.  The idea is the same, only instead of having a seperate addon unit, all the parts would be included in every single cartridge.<br /><br />This, of course, is totally impractical.  And if you're going to go this far with NES addons you might as well not even bother with the NES part.<br /><br />Plus fabricating imaginary mappers (which that TMNT demo didn't do) is a big no-no.  It's hard enough to stay on top of mappers that actually exist.

Please before reading my comment and replying, be aware that I'm very new to 6502 assembly so maybe I won't understand much technical stuff. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> I'm sorry if my english is bad.<br /><br />I found a demo ROM at zophar.net displaying the TMNT logo while playing a high quality sample file (probably OGG Vorbis) also known as the show's music theme. They described that it uses an "obscure mapper", probably made from scratch.<br /><br />I'm very interested into this topic so I might ask you: Is it possible to create a non-physical mapper (for the beginning) that can play OGG Vorbis or WAVE files, during the executing program, without slowdowns?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3763">Eightbit Allstar</a> — Fri Jan 02, 2009 5:48 pm</p><hr />
