		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry to revive a bit of a dead thread, however I felt this was worth reviving.<br /><br />After reading through this: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://hackmii.com/2010/01/the-weird-and-wonderful-cic/">http://hackmii.com/2010/01/the-weird-and-wonderful-cic/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />And then scouring through the dumps, I've come to the conclusion that the Pin 4 mod is completely fine and will work on any NES. I had not heard of nor seen of the Pin 4 grounding/floating not working unless there was something else wrong with the NES. You have tested things as not working on a breadboard, NOT on the NES. You are the ONE person to claim that this doesn't work, and you've tried to claim how you are so above and beyond the talent of everybody else. I've come to the conclusion that you are just spreading complete and utter FUD. You have a lot of conflicting information: You claim not all 3193A's are the same, and yet you are posting code from the 3195A. Also, since the Pin 4 mod simply puts the chip into &quot;key mode&quot; instead of &quot;lock mode&quot;, none of the code that is run if the chip is a lock is relevant and that is a lot of the code you posted. The code you're posting has definitely come from the same source I linked to, however you're messing with comments and stuff like that, and with your comments I was actually beginning to think you might be correct; reading the comments of a reputable source, however, proved otherwise. Segher knows his stuff. You are just some random dude who I've only seen here.<br /><br />The pin 4 mod puts the chip into key mode, nothing more nothing less. Let's say you have an unmodded NES and a game that works with said NES. Swap the 2 10NES chips between them and it will make no difference (unless of course you messed up some soldering). This is something that has been proven time and time again. <strong>The only difference is that the cartridge doesn't supply power to Pin 4, and the NES does.</strong><br /><br />I had recently been digging into the 10NES chip quite a bit, and I just had to post this. I'm an above-average computer programmer and started out with some soldering a while ago; I know my way around software and hardware, and it's enough to know that you're wrong.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i never said segher was wrong about about anything .. this thread has nothing to do with his work. other then he reversed the instruction set for the cic. far as credibility goes my JCIC (Jims Cool integrated Circuit) is being used by infiniteneslives projects .. seems you only made one post on this forum.. you dont have a website linked .. don't mean to sound like a grump <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />the code i posted was showing why the pin#4 mod works not why it doesn't on some consoles..<br />it was also tested in a console and worked (would run games) .. console was confirmed working after.. the cic was also confirmed functioning after on a bread board.  i know my way around software and hardware too.. <br /><br />3193A, 3195A, 3196A work exactly the same only seeds change.. nescic-dis.txt is a 6113 as far as i know.. the comments and labels are to make it easier to read and they are correct.. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> <br /><br />anyway welcome to nesdev.. cheers  <img src="./images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">pemdawg wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Just ran into this the other day while modding a stack of NESes. Wired pin 4 to GND, and it wouldn't even give a red power light. Removed jumper wire, and left it floating. All is well. WTF? Anyway, it was a REV 07 board I believe. Only decks I have here now are 07s and 10s. Haven't had any others to test it on.</div><br /><br />what did the chip say on it? .. does it light up every time you hit power with it floating or act random?
