The Famicom PPU has 240 lines because an NTSC TV signal technically has 240 lines per field, and Nintendo was probably wanting to brag about full-screen display when competing NTSC VDPs were limited to a 192-line display with what are now thought of as huge top and bottom borders. But because of variance in overscan among 1970s TVs, whose tolerances weren't as tight as those made in the 1980s, the background planning sheets on which Nintendo designers designed FC screen layouts had markings around a 224x192 pixel rectangular safe area, outside which important information should not be drawn. Only several years into the Famicom's life cycle, when game design practices were hitting limits of video memory bandwidth from the CPU, did Nintendo decide to add a mode with a longer blanking period, which was the 224-line mode on the S-PPU.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Oct 19, 2014 12:50 pm</p><hr />

That's because it's an NTSC game with NTSC resolution forced on PAL system. Even though you're using your PAL console, it's still the NTSC resolution (the way the game was officially programmed). PAL resolution is actually higher than NTSC (PAL height is a bit higher) so if you want to display an image in NTSC resolution, PAL just centers the screen and.... there is some space left, so the machine fills it with black color. In results you see a very nasty picture that looks just like in the photo you provided in this topic. Here you have a picture to get the idea:<br /><img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/2lmbblv.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">ALL</span></strong> the games from 8/16-bit era were done that way.

Yes, there are black top and bottom borders on Super Famicom and Super NES (U) games that use 224-line mode. You can see them on a TV capture card for PC or a professional studio monitor, but a standard consumer TV will mostly cut them off. The area that occupies the 4:3 frame (as defined by Rec. 601) is actually 280 by 240 pixels, including 24 pixels of side border that TVs also cut off.<br /><br />Pixel aspect ratio on the NES and Super NES is exactly 8:7 for NTSC and very close to 11:8 for PAL. Games should theoretically be (but in practice aren't) redrawn for PAL, but that's only practical for games where the 8x8 grid is unimportant, like fighting games or mode 7 racers.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Oct 18, 2014 5:09 pm</p><hr />

Interesting.

NTSC has ~240 active lines per field, and PAL has ~288 active lines per field. Given that they have just about the same horizontal resolution, an image with 4:3 aspect ratio in NTSC will be skewed approximately to 8:5 in PAL.<br /><br />By the way, the 8:5 aspect ratio is not uncommon for widescreen computer monitors. (They call it 16:10 instead of 8:5.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5948">Joe</a> — Sat Oct 18, 2014 3:50 pm</p><hr />

I've got a question to you:<br /><br />Today, I played &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; on a PAL Super Nintendo and I noticed that the game looks pretty &quot;widescreen&quot;. I know that especially this game has black bars hardcoded into the game. But it still doesn't look right. Let me demonstrate it:<br /><br />This is the select screen as a pixel perfect representation (256 x 224, black bars are part of the image generated by the Super Nintendo):<br /><img src="http://i60.tinypic.com/2qm0w7r.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />This is the same image stretched to a 4:3 aspect ratio:<br /><img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/2yn00pl.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />And this is the image from my TV:<br /><img src="http://i57.tinypic.com/2d91z68.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Notice that the rectangles with the faces look square.<br /><br />While I have two CRT TVs, one PAL and one NTSC, unfortunately, I don't have an NTSC Super Nintendo, nor a PAL NES available. So, there's no way for me to compare it directly. That's why I'm asking you: What would the game look like on an NTSC TV? Vertically, would it be stretched more? Or would it look the same?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6156">DRW</a> — Sat Oct 18, 2014 3:29 pm</p><hr />
