The video signal is generated entirely on the cartridge, so that part is clear, same with CPU and RAM (no idea about sound, but it's not generated on the console itself either). Your biggest problem would be the controllers being a completely different beast, but I would assume that if you were making the game exclusively for the Cassette Vision (or at least a dedicated version for it), you could just change the code accordingly.<br /><br />Also skimming through the Super Cassette Vision doc. Holy shit 32×32 sprites o_O

Huh... well I guess you could try figuring out how those games work. Sadly you won't be able to make homebrew on a stock console without sacrificing an existing cartridge or doing it in a FPGA or the like. (alternatively, make a console that has those innards already in it, but then it won't be stock anymore)<br /><br />I have no idea if any info on that exists though.
