Yeah, the basic idea is that an iNES music file is a totally standard iNES ROM whose reset handler reads the track number to play, etc. from zero-page bytes. This way an emulator doesn't need any special handling, other than doctoring the initial values of those zero-page locations before powering up the emulated NES. To change tracks, you repeat the above process. So you never need to know anything about how the music code works, where its routines are, etc. and the music code has full flexibility in how it works, and what mapper it uses. This of course would supplement NSF, rather than replace it, since NSF works fine for most music.<br /><br />That covers the essential functionality. You could also have the info strings at the beginning of PRG data, so that they are always at offset $10 in the file. And you could have some way of plugging in a NES-based UI, so that it can be booted standalone on a NES. Perhaps the reset code would check for a signature in zero-page; if not present, it jumps to an area where the NES-based front-end can be plugged in, and also specifies routines similar to NSF for changing the track while running.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sun Jul 25, 2010 4:46 am</p><hr />

Let me guess, you want to rip the NSF out of your ROM?<br /><br />NES2NSF is not really a conversion utility. As it says in the readme, it's a NSF compilation utility. It's purpose is to take a large NES/FC ROM image and split it into specified sized bank files (it also removes the iNES header for you). It also has a detection method based on the config file settings to detect writes to $4015. Also a setting to prepend a NSF header or not to prepend a NSF header. Sounds great in theory, but it has a bug when splitting 8K banks, they are split incorrectly. It also has a copy of a NSF header with some default settings for the NSF spec which you need to edit with a hex editor. Btw, you can edit that config file. All you do is change the numbers at the top that kind of resemble bits. Some of them can be larger than a 0 or 1. Anyways, you don't need to use this utility. It's buggy and it's not really effective anymore, as far as I'm concerned. I use a different file splitter now days.<br /><br />If you're making a ROM that is mapper 0, 16K or 32K. All you need do is load up a emulator (FCEU mod) and dump $8000 - $FFFF from the memory viewer (after snapping at a write break point to $4000 - $4008). If you made a ROM that has a origin of $C000, then you dump $C000 - $FFFF (make sure you change the load address). Using this method gives you a completely stripped file. After that, prepend a NSF header to it and fill out the NSF spec information via a hex editor.<br /><br />If you want more details, I have a document that shows you how to rip NSFs. <a href="http://gilgalad.arc-nova.org/intro.html" class="postlink">NSF Ripper Guide</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=43">Gil-Galad</a> — Wed Jul 21, 2010 12:49 am</p><hr />
