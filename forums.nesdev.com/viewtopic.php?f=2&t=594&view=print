<br />
<br />This is the same reason why most licensed Zapper/PowerPad games only allow said peripheral to be connected to the <strong>second</strong> controller port - on the Famicom they were connected to the expansion port, which connected them to the bits in $4017 only.

<br />
<br />Better to leave the benign code in rather than remove it and possibly cause problems.
<br />
<br />Along the lines of curious joypad behavior, I recently noticed that Zelda 2 and Super Mario Bros. 3 (and probably others) check the joypad twice in succession and repeat back as long as the two readings differ. My only guess was that this is compensation for bad joypads (maybe another Famicom-only issue?).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks, I understand it better now. The famicom had two hardwired joypads (that's $4016.0 and $4017.0) and one expension port where the extended thing like Zapper or another revised controller could be connected. But then, is it $4016.1 or $4017.1, or both ? If $4016.1 is the extension data, then is $4017.1 the 2nd pad's microphone data (1=Some someone is crying in the microphone, 0=there is total silent in the room) ?
<br />
<br />Blagg : Yeah, once I noted CV3 to do this. I think it is effectively to avoid bad contacts in the joypad's case ?
<br />
<br />I also noted that most licenced games that are only playable trough the first controller still reads the segond one, even if it's not used in the game. Is that because of the expension port ? Or is that a library stuff ?

<br />Could be to reject the use of the turbo function on unlicensed controllers that used the strobe bit rather than an internal 50 Hz or 60 Hz clock to invert buttons.

<br />
<br />It's probably a generic library function for reading both controllers and automatically calculating the necessary delta information so they can easily handle on-press events (jumping, shooting, pausing) as well as on-hold events (walking, running, charging weapons).

<br />So a japaneese guy could use the hardwired controller ($4016.0) as well than another custom controller ($4016.1), and all games would work well.
<br />On the american and european NES, none of the controller is hardwired, and the data available for standard controller is $4016.0, $4016.1 will always be zero, right ?

<br />I'm not sure I agree with what you are saying.  The expansion connector on the bottom of the NES (NTSC toaster) is accessible to the user.  It is under a small plastic cover, but it is removed similar to the battery cover on a TV remote.  This does not damage the unit in any way.  Do you have an NES which does not have this cover?  I've never seen such a thing.

<br />
<br />The original NES expansion port (on the bottom of the unit) is enclosed under two pieces of plastic.  The first piece of plastic is a user-removable shell (removed by applying pressure to the two "tabs" on the left and right).  The second piece of plastic is actually attached to the shell of the NES itself; to access the actual port underneathe by (if I remember right) 6 little plastic tabs -- you'd need to break off this cover for you to gain access to the expansion port.  In doing so, you'd probably void the warranty on your NES.
<br />
<br />Nintendo removed the expansion port from the top-loading NES when that model was released.  AFAIK, there are absolutely no games / applications which use this port.

<br />Oh my god. Was that device made to gamble for *real* with your *real* money ? If so, that's horrible. Interesting, but horrible. 
<br />I think this was a 100% unlicensed project, because Nintendo wouldn't allow such things, especially when thinking that they censored the cruch in FF1 to replace them with clinics, and FF2 wasn't released in the US because the hero had to pray to a statue to rescue the wounds. Castlevania 3 also was censored a lot.
