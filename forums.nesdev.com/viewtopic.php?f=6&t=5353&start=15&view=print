<br />
<br />Yeah, I know. But since the original song cannot be redone on the real thing (they just looped a sample) and you cannot reset the noise seed, you have to fake a little bit.  I tried it on the famicom and it sound good enough. Without that extra square, you lose the punch of the explosion on the second one.
<br />
<br />The extra triangle kick drum was not there too but it gives a little bit of character I think.

<br />
<br />I'm just a perfectionist at heart <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  By trying to make it the same, when I fail, that make me learn new sound that I would not have found before.  By listening to the pitch of the explosion, I could reproduce the low ones at the beginning with squares ones and tone 0, very short volume. It makes some kind of fuzz and almost reproduce that noise. The second higher pitch noise after the silence, I cannot get the pitch right yet. For very high pitch in the noise, I cannot yet identify the pitch with the proper noise note, if they even exist on the nes.
<br />
<br />I'm just surprised that no mega man fans commented on the song I made but that's ok I guess since this thread was not about that.  I may make another thread for it if I want people opinion.  I think it sound the same. On the famicom, the song is like the real game.  The explosion... hmm. getting closer.

<br />How did I miss that!!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />  I checked all the soundtrack one by one before, too fast it seems.  It's in the nsf, track 40.  Only noise used but now I can read the pattern and volume so I will test it and see how it sounds.
<br />
<br />I got my answer!  Thanks a million Fx3!  It seems I'm not a mega man nerd enough <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  Another name to put in my list of thanks when my project is finished.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Verdict after the finding by Fx3:  It cannot be redone on the nes exactly like the intro because of the way noise work.  I have all the note and everything change on the second explosion.  So I will have to fake it.  Thanks again Fx3 for the information!
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />Here's the final version of the song, with the new explosion : <a href="http://www14.ocn.ne.jp/~banshaku/misc/Rockman9_intro1e.nsf" class="postlink">Rockman 9 - Intro 1</a>.  
<br />
<br />The explosion is more uniform.  The triangle kick was removed since it's not necessary. The first noise that cause that specific tone at the beginning had to be faked with 2 square sound, there is no other way. Still, I like the final result.  It will be interesting to hear it again on my famicom tonight.  Small detail, I corrected the snare to be more like the real song (like the movie posted in that thread).
<br />
<br />Thanks everyone for all the information, I really appreciate it.   I will be more than happy to show where I will use the sound, once my demo is built. For now, I'm just regrouping some assets.

<br />
<br />When I remade MM9's soundtrack I noticed the noise they used for a "kick" was actually not possible on the NES, ..or it is, but they sampled a certain variation of the noise that comes out of the NES randomly. It sounds like a very soft representation of the noise generator. So, the best thing to do is simply set the lowest instance of noise on the NES and use that instead.
<br />
<br />You're obviously not going to get it 100% perfect.
<br />
<br />The platforms in Mega Man 9 in Jewel Man's stage is also an example of "not possible on the NES" since it uses 2 volume instances of the Triangle wave, and obviously can't. If you want to redo that one, I would suggest having the "echoed" part on one of the square channels.

<br />It actually made me think of Gameboy noise...
