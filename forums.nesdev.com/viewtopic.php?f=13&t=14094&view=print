I could test it myself right now, but I'm trying to encourage the principle of learning things for yourself, so I'd rather waste more time typing this response than it would take just to figure out the answer and tell him. Principles, right? Hrm.<br /><br />Why would a few seconds of avatar being &quot;wrong&quot; be a problem?
