<br />Resizeable main window would be nice, although it's not a big deal. Overall I just felt it was a bit unintuitive and since there's no documentation... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />For the record, I am using Windows 7 (64-bit) and it worked out of the box. I don't remember ever installing any VB6 runtimes or common controls either.

<br />I just downloaded the specific files it was complaining about and put them in the same folder as the program, that did the trick.
<br />
<br />As for the program itself, it's an interesting approach to a map editor, but as expected it can't please everyone. Definitely a step in the right direction, but I can't help thinking that it should be more flexible. Specially the metatile arrangements, it shouldn't be that hard to allow multiple depths of metatiles of arbitrary sizes.
<br />
<br />Another problem I had was the map size... What are the limitations in this program exactly? I tried to make a fairly large map and it wouldn't let me.
<br />
<br />It also crashed randomly without telling me why, which was a bit frustrating, but that's expected from a WIP tool I guess. Another thing that bugs me is that you used Visual Basic 6 (a tool from 1998!) to make it, and that instantly makes your tool look and feel outdated.

<br />Did you recreate them manually or did you write an extractor for the 16x16 metatiles from SMB1 [or does this tool extract the info]?  When I was working on the map editor for NESICIDE I thought it'd be nice to offer an extractor feature but such a feature I soon found would require specialized routines for each game.

<br />One way to do it semi-automatically would be to offer a "generate map from picture" function. So it would look for metatiles in the picture, discarding duplicates. It could even support metatiles in metatiles. The palette would have to be organized properly to 16 colors like in NES (so it can detect metatile attributes) or it could be specified in the app. Mappy has a function like this, which I've used to convert maps from <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.vgmaps.com/Atlas/NES/index.htm">http://www.vgmaps.com/Atlas/NES/index.htm</a><!-- m -->.

<br />
<br />I agree.  For those on Windows 7 or even XP who are concerned with screwing up their desktop, you could build a virtual machine dedicated to running older software and packages that require VB6 modules.  Some of our developers do this to emulate older environments for testing purposes.
<br />
<br />I use VMWare Workstation since we're a VMWare shop, but you could use a free alternative such as VirtualBox...
<br />

<br />
<br />Not a bad way to go unless you just enjoy having an old Pentium on your desk.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />
<br />As for the distribution licensing (tepples makes an excellent point) -- I'm not sure, but it needs to be verified.  There has to be an answer to this out on the web somewhere though.  Even if he can't legally include the files with his software, the bare minimum would be to tell people "You need to download &lt;this&gt; and &lt;this&gt; on Windows XP before this software will work", giving links directly to Microsoft.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Apparently XP folks will need to download *two* packages from Microsoft to get this software to run:
<br />
<br />* Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Common Controls
<br /><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=25437d98-51d0-41c1-bb14-64662f5f62fe&amp;displaylang=en" class="postlink">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=25437d98-51d0-41c1-bb14-64662f5f62fe&amp;displaylang=en</a>
<br />
<br />* Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 SP6 Run-time Redistribution Pack
<br /><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyId=7B9BA261-7A9C-43E7-9117-F673077FFB3C&amp;displaylang=en" class="postlink">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyId=7B9BA261-7A9C-43E7-9117-F673077FFB3C&amp;displaylang=en</a>

<br />
<br />This is a perfect example of why blargg started a thread asking which people had problems with him.  This kind of response is highly inflammatory and completely unhelpful in every way shape and form.
<br />
<br />Maybe instead you should be blaming the author of the software for using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic#Timeline" class="postlink">version of Visual Basic</a> that came out in 1997-1998?
<br />
<br />There's also great irony in complaining about "using an old operating system" on a web board that's about consoles made over 20 years ago.
