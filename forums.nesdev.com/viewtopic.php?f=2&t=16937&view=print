Did you even take time to learn that a game has already been made with the toolkit as-is? <br /><br />The only &quot;problem&quot; is see is that specific engines may cause some saturation of play-alikes, but they're even planning to add quite a bunch of modules (what the KS is for) which should remedy that at least halfway.  There's also the risk when something becomes &quot;too easy&quot; that there will be an output of low-quality designed games as the stakes are lower (see game maker), but then again, you don't need to play them. <br /><br />Honestly i think this is a great entryway for people to get into NesDev. Once you've made a couple of games inside their engines, you might want to dive in.

It is good that you can create new modules for your game style, and I'd imagine it's possible to edit the asm for existing modules, though I don't see that information anywhere so it's just a guess.

It cant be easy to script a complete engine like this. I dont know what the OP issue is. Maybe he should watch the documentary first before judging. Great idea and I will be backing this project.<br />I would like to know if it supports different mappers and battery saving.

I expect the first and maybe second goal will happen, meaning an influx of zelda and mario clones by 10-year olds.

I stopped using it because I felt like somebody else was doing the work for me. It felt like I was saying: &quot;I don't want to have to choose the tens of thousands of details required to make a unique game, I want somebody else to choose them for me.&quot; Once I found my way to nesdev and realized there was very little such help available (along with many other factors influencing my decision) I never looked back. Funny to see the scene come full circle and provide this sort of solution to others. I am very interested to see how the scene changes over the next few years, assuming this tool is funded and continues to gain more attention.

If anything turns out good, that's a bonus.
