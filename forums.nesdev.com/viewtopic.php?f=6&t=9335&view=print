There's no readme in archive.<br />Does it support any expansion chips?(VRC6\7? MMC5?) Does it have Sound Effects support?<br />But I take a look. And I'm not sure how diffferent it is from Famitracker engine.<br />But it is nice to have a template for ASM6 with built in engine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's a simple sound engine. Only square, triangle and noise are supported. Sound effects are supported thru playing &quot;mini songs&quot; that temporarily overwrite the current state of the four channels. My target group of users are people who want simplicity or who are looking for an easy solution and don't want to tinker with it too much.

It'd be easier for all of us if GradualGames would make and upload a subtitle file.

I am shopping for a sound engine for my project right now. I'd like to be able to compose in FamiTracker, but it's not nessecary. I mainly need a sound engine that's light on the cycles. I don't need complicated stuff like the effects, just volume and duty cycle control.<br /><br />It'd be fairly easy to make my own from those requirements, but in order to use FamiTracker to compose I'd need to go to FT Dev School <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />When I have some more time I'm going to look closely at this solution and see if it suits my needs. Maybe I can just comment out some of the stuff I don't need.

It doesn't support all FamiTracker effects, nor does it support duty envelopes, just a constant duty for each instrument.
