Thought you old-game-type people would be interested in such a game.

I was told I should play it, mostly to avoid accidentally making the game like it, so I did. I'm not saying it's a bad game, but I did<strong> not</strong> enjoy it in the slightest. For whatever reason I didn't find it particularly challenging, and the floaty physics were really off-putting for me. I think the graphics are not very appealing, being focused on being &quot;gross&quot;, so not much really drew me to play it a second time. As for IWBTG, I've seen the game played, and my roommate / other guy making our game has played it, but I have yet to actually do so. I went to a lot of effort to make our game feel NOTHING like SMB. A lot of people saw the game and drew the comparison, but when you play it you will find it is a very different game. Eh.<br /><br />I know what you mean about the fake-old-game thing. Probably the most irksome to me is when people do &quot;pixel art&quot; and then it isn't actually aligned to any pixel grid, so you have things stuck between pixel boundaries and the effect is completely ruined. I guess my tastes are eclectic and I'm anal about this kind of thing, but I see it as an important factor. For our game, we set restrictions and stuck to them all the way - 2-bit graphic tiles, one button and movement, all music made on Nintendo systems with no post-production work (famitracker and LSDJ). I hope that it has given it somewhat more of a feel of authenticity. <br /><br />The demo comes out tomorrow, and while it's <em>really</em> hacked together to get it presentable enough to give people (the code for the temporary title screen and level select is offensive), it's at least playable. Six levels are available, I encourage you guys to try it out; it'll support the <s>Virtual Boy</s> Rift as well.<br /><br />Also, awesome Tempest, gotta love those vector monitors! I can't even handle the Puyo Puyo Tsu candy cab. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">tl;dr i wasn't much of a fan of super meat boy</span><br /><span style="font-size: 50%; line-height: normal">i'm not shitting on it just saying it's not the type of game I enjoy</span>

Super meatboy isn't even the worst in the regard because at least it starts you off at the same stage. It's just not that much fun imo to do the same thing over and over 200x times til you get that exact timing right.<br />Now I'm sure you can find examples where I'll disagree with what I wrote above, but it goes for most games.<br /><br />That being said your game looks pretty cool, just not for me either.<br />Cheers <img src="./images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" />
