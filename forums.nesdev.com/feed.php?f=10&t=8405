There is absolutely no need to enter all the music data as hex values in an assembly source, it is major waste of time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Thu Dec 15, 2011 2:59 am</p><hr />

Please bear in mind i'm a complete noob, so i wouldn't have the first idea about creating a sound engine! (Im not sure i even know what one is in this context  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> )<br /></div><br /><br />Sorry! Sometimes I get long-winded, so lately I've been trying to condense what I say. In doing so I guess I may be too brief <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />. Basically by "sound engine" I just mean the code in your project that handles the making of sound effects and music.<br /><br />With something like Famitracker or NT2, when you're done making all your songs they get compiled all into an NSF (NES Sound File). This is what you include in your project if you choose to go with using one of these tools. This file actually contains code within it that you execute, and it plays your songs for you. The problems with this are that the NSF may be large due to the code within it being designed for features you may not have used, and also the fact that the NSF's code uses RAM you may have allocated to something else (basically it may use a lot of resources you could conserve by making your own sound engine). But what's nice is you don't have to worry about designing your own sound engine, and you get a nice user interface to make music in.<br /><br />Making a sound engine can be extremely beneficial, depending on your project's restrictions. Have you experimented with making sound on the NES by directly storing values into the NES's sound registers? This is where it would all start. Making a sound engine is basically finding out how you can get those values into the sound registers that make the sounds you want. It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you're familiar with how to make a specific pitch at a specific volume with a specific tone, you have the essentials down. It's just a matter of getting right sounds to play at the right time; that's all music really is.<br /><br />One of the main reasons I designed my own sound engine was to conserve space. When you design the engine, you design how the data (music) that's fed into it is structured. For example, I might design an engine that expects one byte to define the length of the note I want played in the song, and then another to define the pitch. Or, as I have done in my current project, I might design a way for the pitch and length to fit into one byte, which in the long run, saves a lot of space. If space or RAM usage aren't really a concern for you, you may not have to be concerned with making your own engine. I will say the ones that Famitracker and NT2 offer are pretty flexible, and you should be able to do most things with them, so the amount of features supported by them shouldn't be an issue. It's just the resources they consume.<br /><br />In terms of how I use Cubase 6, I just use it for actually composing the music. Once I like the way it sounds, I create a version of the music designed for my sound engine completely by hand. By that, I mean I'm basically defining the hex values that my sound engine will read to play the song. I don't have any special conversion tools or anything to streamline the process, unfortunately.<br /><br />Does that sort of make sense? I know being new to this, it can be a lot to absorb; I started off with all of this with absolutely no programming experience whatsoever. So if you'd like me to clarify anything, I'd be happy to do so <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Thu Dec 15, 2011 12:08 am</p><hr />

I'm personally doubt that making a custom sound engine is a good idea. It only make sense when making a custom sound engine is your goal by itself, or when existing engines are not capable for something specific. If you don't need anything special, you would spend major amount of time on this instead of working on actual project, without gaining anything useful in return. Don't forget, it is not only the engine itself, but also some tools for making or converting music and sound effects. If you going to enter music and sound data by hand as hex, it is again time that could be spent on more useful things.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Tue Dec 13, 2011 3:41 pm</p><hr />

I actually use Cubase 6 as well, but I don't have a way to make stuff in Cubase and have it automatically turned into a sound engine-friendly format for the NES. I just use it for actually composing the music, then I usually enter the data my sound engine would need to play the same thing by hand. It also depends on your sound engine, and what its capabilities are. I would recommend doing your own sound engine rather than using something like Famitracker or NT2. You can save more RAM and tailor their capabilities to your needs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Tue Dec 13, 2011 2:42 pm</p><hr />

It is a good idea to mess with these tools for some time, making few small pieces of music, before starting to work on actual music for your game. If you don't have previous experience with chiptunes and trackers, it may take major amount of time before you learn how to achieve good sound quality. Check <a href="http://famitracker.shoodot.net/wiki/index.php5?title=Main_Page" class="postlink">FamiTracker's wiki</a>, specifically the 'how to' section to learn some important tricks (they aren't really FamiTracker-specific).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Tue Dec 13, 2011 10:36 am</p><hr />

It could give very good result, but it is not program that does it, it depends on your own tracking skills. In theory it is possible to have sound quality on NES that is not achievable with FamiTracker (higher update rates, PCM drums, Neil Baldwin-style auto echo), but it is not often seen or required for actual games.<br /><br />Currently there are two ways to use music created in FamiTracker.<br /><br />First - use the player that is provided by the FamiTracker author, jsr. This way whatever you create with FamiTracker will be playable on NES. There are drawbacks: size of the music data and player code, amount of CPU time used by the player, and lack of sound effects support. It is relatively easy to add sound effects, but not much to do with other drawbacks. Thus the player mostly used for music demos.<br /><br />Second - use FamiTone, a separate sound library that play music that is created with FamiTracker with certain limitations. It has a bit faster and smaller player and a bit more compact data, sound effects are available too. Drawback is that it does not support most of advanced FamiTracker features, so you can't play whatever you created, only music that was specifically composed for the player. The limitations are though, but you can hear in all my NES games that they aren't too bad, you still can have good sound quality.<br /><br /><br />For <a href="http://kkfos.aspekt.fi/projects/nes/tools/pornotracker/" class="postlink">Pornotracker</a> there is the <a href="http://kkfos.aspekt.fi/projects/nes/muse/" class="postlink">MUSE</a> library, feature-wise it is probably something inbetween FamiTracker original player and FamiTone. It has sound effects support as well.<br /><br /><br />There is also a license question that you may want to take into account. FamiTracker itself is GPL, but no license specified for the player, so you may want to ask jsr about it whether it is under GPL too. FamiTone is Public Domain. No license specified for MUSE too, so you may want to ask thefox about it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Tue Dec 13, 2011 9:41 am</p><hr />

FamiTracker and Pornotracker are both legitimate and actually the easiest ways to make music for NES programs. Not rely on the MIDI import feature too much, though, because amount of the tweaks it'll require is comparable with remaking your MIDI files by the hand (this certainly will work better than import).<br /><br />In any case, waveforms are predefined (pulse with 12.5%, 25% and 50% duty cycle, triangle, noise). The instrument editor only allow to create some volume and pitch envelopes. Trackers in general are a kind of step sequencer.<br /><br />Certainly, a Windows PC is a better platform for NES development, solely because of the fact that most tools are available for Windows only. Luckily, many of them work under Wine well, so you still can use Mac or Linux, it is just not going to be very comfortable.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Tue Dec 13, 2011 4:15 am</p><hr />

Hi Shiru, thanks for the response man <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I've just been reading a bit more about Famitracker, and it doesn't seem too difficult. I know this is probably a silly question, but is Famitracker a legitimate way of creating tunes that could be used in an actual NES game?<br /><br />In terms of the software itself, would it be reasonable to say that it seems to work like a cross between a synth (creating/shaping sounds from waveforms) and a step sequencer?<br /><br />I'm familiar with both of these processes, so if i could learn how to use that, would that be a good way to go?<br /><br />I also read about an import MIDI feature? Perhaps it would be possible to use basic MIDI data, import it into Famitracker and then tweak it? The reason why this would be helpful to me is that much of the music i wish to create for the NES is stuff i already have composed in MIDI, so it would save me a lot of time doing it this way instead of having to entirely re-compose it from scratch...<br /><br />Also, i realise Famitracker is Windows only, if this is the best way to go, perhaps i should just buy a cheap Windows system. It seems from reading your response in the graphics thread that maybe i should just bit the bullet and have a PC for my NES work?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5021">Sendo</a> — Tue Dec 13, 2011 4:03 am</p><hr />

You can convert MIDI to NES music, but you would have to write tools all by yourself (or ask someone), and the result is not going to be top quality. It could provide acceptable quality, though.<br /><br />The easiest way to do it is probably by making a converter that will create data for one of existing music/sfx players for NES, like FamiTone or MUSE. This mean you would only need to make a converter part, and use existing code on NES side, less work.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Tue Dec 13, 2011 1:34 am</p><hr />

So i'm about to start learning how to compose music for my game. I'm an experienced musician, producer and engineer. I've been making music for about 20 years now, and i have my own studio, however i'm completely new to composing music for the NES.<br /><br />My setup at the moment is Mac Book Pro, running Cubase 6. I use the Yamaha QY series of step sequencers to compose MIDI, as well as the internal map in Cubase.<br /><br />I suppose my first (and probably massively naive) question is, is this setup suitable for NES composition? For example could i simply compose the music on my sequencer and then covert the MIDI data NES data when it is complete? <br /><br />Reading this thread (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=8007&amp;sid=b43d1d4f42d98cd66d93bd79525218f9">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopi ... 79525218f9</a><!-- m -->) and it seems like it's possible, but i didn't understand a lot of what's being discussed, i need you guys to be gentle with me! <br /><br />I have other questions, but i think this is probably the best place to start. Thanks guys!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5021">Sendo</a> — Mon Dec 12, 2011 11:27 pm</p><hr />
