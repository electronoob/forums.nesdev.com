As koitsu pointed out, we're none of us lawyers. I'm not giving legal advice. At the same time, though, I doubt there's much an uninvolved lawyer could tell us about this case that isn't already clear.<br /><br />You should consult a lawyer when you actually have some undertaking planned that you need to understand the legality of. You should also definitely have a lawyer if you're starting a company or making a large financial commitment, etc. but slobu isn't really asking for legal advice in this thread; I think he just wants to know the lay of the land, and I don't think that requires a legal professional.<br /><br />If you want to make a game that does not infringe on copyrights, this is generally very easy to do. You hardly need a lawyer's advice to proceed with that. Even if you've already made a very close clone of something, unless your clone depends on usurping the identity of the thing it's cloning (which Princess Rescue arguably does), it's relatively easy to change enough to make it legal once you realize you can't use it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Fri Sep 27, 2013 9:54 pm</p><hr />

Specific text, characters, art, and music, and other things of this nature are very copyrightable, If you make a direct copy of any of those things, the case for copyright infringement is very clear. If it's new art but clearly based on someone's old property, it is less clear, but legal cases often argue about whether the borrowed material is &quot;substantial&quot; enough to be copyright infringement.<br /><br />Gameplay itself is usually considered too utilitarian to fall under copyright. (There have been exceptions, but in general it remains true.) It is very normal in game design (professional or otherwise) to borrow gameplay mechanics freely from other games. The thing about this is most games are borrowing from many sources, and the complex interaction of elements makes the combination distinct from other games. On the other hand, if you start lifting every single mechanic from one particular game, copy their implementation exactly, etc. it starts to look a lot more like infringement (and it gets very, very grey here).<br /><br />There are many, many cases where a game is copied very closely, but the art/music is all new, with no legal repercussions for the clonist. I'd go as far as to say that this is rather the norm in the industry. Clones like this have always been quite abundant. There are several notable cases where they have been sued successfully, but I don't think it happens often.<br /><br /><br />What about Spelunky seems at all suspect to you? The whole exploring-caves-in-a-pith-hat motif is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenes_a_faire" class="postlink">scènes à faire</a>, I'd say, so I don't think the art/music deserves much scrutiny (though the golden idol I'm sure is directly based on the one in Raiders of the Lost Ark). The basic mechanics of gameplay are all well established as well, I can't see anything that looks like it's borrowed from somewhere in particular here. The details of the gameplay get rather unique when you start looking at how the particular items/enemies/level-generation all works together in this game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Fri Sep 27, 2013 9:32 pm</p><hr />

If you want to make a similar game it's completely legal to do so under normal circumstances. There is a difference between &quot;inspired by&quot; and &quot;entirely based on&quot;.

Thanks for the discussion, guys!  I think the victims here are anyone who wants to create original but respectfully similar games.  I classify these kinds of games as tribute or homage.<br /><br />  Honestly I was fishing for what people consider appropriate to make a non infringing but clearly paying tribute to certain games.  How would one pay tribute to, say, Super Pitfall without fear of C&amp;D?<br /><br />Is it really just a matter of imitating the game engine and replacing character names, sprites and music to something different?  How different?  Where is the line?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4942">slobu</a> — Fri Sep 27, 2013 5:21 am</p><hr />
