		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, I've created a few images using Fox's NES image converter.  I have the image file as an NES rom.  I would like to somehow have it play my Famitracker music while displaying these images.  So when you turn on the game, the full screen will be the image while the music is playing, then you press a button on the controller and that will change the song and possibly change the image.  I would really like to make something like this, I just don't have much programming knowledge ( as I'm more of a visual/audio person).<br /><br />Any help is greatly appreciated!  Thank you<br /><br />I'm willing to learn as much as I possibly can, but I'm also considering hiring someone to help me with this. Basically I need a program that will allow me to have a full screen image with audio playback that has controller input to change the songs/image on screen. Also known as a slideshow  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As I remember, the Fox's converter uses tricks to increase color resolution that require precise timings. In this case having FamiTracker music could be a problem, as it wasn't designed to work fast. When there is enough CPU time, like a third of the screen, it is not a problem, but if there is nametable switching every lines or a few, it is. DPCM would be another problem, as it affects the timings.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've integrated Famitracker's music driver into a demo before.  Make sure you give it enough CPU time, 40 scanlines should be fine.<br />This means you can have timed code, but you need 40 contiguous scanlines at the bottom of the screen, unless you use a mapper with interrupts.

I've seen similar &quot;slideshow/music&quot; things done before, like Heosphoros &quot;Embered Recollections&quot; ROM. His music uses DPCM, has full screen images, etc.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I did a program of this kind in the past. It had FamiTracker music, used three splits with timed code to make full screen picture, and allowed DPCM (the picture pieces were overlapped to avoid missing lines). It is also possible to alternate two screen on the whole screen basis, but not per-line (a method of reducing the flicker). This isn't too difficult. Anything more advanced will be difficult.

Please install <a href="http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi" class="postlink">Python</a> and <a href="http://effbot.org/media/downloads/PIL-1.1.7.win32-py2.7.exe" class="postlink">Python Imaging Library</a>, and then download <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=100523#p100523" class="postlink">my NES graphics editor and converter</a>.<br /><br />Follow-up question about Python:<br />Do you know how to work the Windows 7 command prompt, or just point-and-click tools?<br /><br />And about image conversion in general:<br />Are you familiar with the <a href="http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a222/theragingdemon/palettes_nes_emus.gif" class="postlink">hex codes of the NES palette</a>? My tool requires you to make the palette manually, and then it tries to fit your image to the palette you made.<br />And could you show me one of your original (not converted) pictures, so that I can see how suitable it'd be for conversion, or do you want to keep them all private?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">nesmaster14 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">3.

Do you use more than 16K of samples total?
