<br />Microsoft is <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/story/12/01/14/0236244/microsoft-taking-aggressive-steps-against-linux-on-arm" class="postlink">requiring</a> all manufacturers of ARM-powered tablets that run Windows 8 to cryptographically lock down the EFI so that no operating systems other than Windows can be installed.
<br />
<br />But I suspect that by "system" you mean a PC. In such a case, the advantage of buying a PC specifically for Linux is that you can make sure that all hardware in the PC is compatible with Linux (and with user-mode driver frameworks that sit on top of Linux, such as X.Org X11). If you buy a PC with Windows and then install Linux later, you risk running into unsupported hardware. If on the other hand, you buy a PC with Linux and then install Windows later, you <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/oem/en/licensing/sblicensing/pages/licensing_for_hobbyists.aspx" class="postlink">do not qualify for OEM pricing</a>.

<br />If not, don't buy a new laptop just to try it out.
<br />But maybe I'm understanding you wrong. Still I'd say dual-boot is the way to go. Buying a second laptop seems unnecessary to me.(Hardware support is improving constantly and it saves space, money and the hassle of using two computers for things you could do with just one)

<br />
<br />VirtualBox is kinda not good memory-wise, I usually get not much room inside Windows (~300 GB HDD), floppies or virtual folders are unusable for me in VirtualBox, on the other hand.
<br />
<br />So here is the short of it:
<br />
<br />1: Not much space for large HDD Images for my Hard Drive.
<br />2: a Floppy drive is not on my Windows computer.
<br />3: 64bit Windows 7 + Virtual Folders + Virtualbox = Confusion and Problems
<br />
<br />EDIT: Been using some tools based off GNU tools (GDB, Bash, etc) for windows before switching,
<br />
<br />Also been reading books on linux as well!
<br />
<br />so I am still learning more, Linux is that good...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To help make your Linux experience as painless as possible, I'll offer a few tips:
<br />
<br />300 GB? That's twice my laptop's hard drive. So you'd get an entire my laptop's worth of Windows space and an entire my laptop's worth of Linux space. If you keep most of your collection of non-tracked music (ogg/mp3/m4a) and non-vector movies (webm/mp4/mkv/avi) on an external drive, that might help.
<br />
<br />To save RAM, you could use a less RAM-hungry distribution such as Xubuntu or even Puppy instead of ordinary Ubuntu. In fact, I recommend Xubuntu for anyone who thinks the tablet-inspired Unity is a pile of fail.
<br />
<br />As for virtual folder fail, does sharing a folder under Windows and accessing it from virtual Linux's Samba tools work?

<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">so I am still learning more, Linux is that good...</div>
<br />No it is not, fanboys just highly overrate it.
<br />There is very good things about linux, but you'll encounters many problems with it like you'd encounter many problems with Windows or any other computer in the world.
