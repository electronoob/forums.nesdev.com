		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a Genesis model 2, and while I have the original AC adapter, I know the AV cables are not original, as when I got my Genesis and the cords at a local game store, they only had Yobo branded AV cables. However, they kind of suck, as they barely stay in the system. I looked on eBay for the original cables, but I can only find aftermarket ones; is it because the connector is a standard, unlike the SNES/N64/GameCube, or what?

(of course you pay admission so you might as well stick around for other reasons).

And it was unfortunatelly needed back in the day, since most TVs here were RF only.<br />Maybe in japan the original AV cables were more common?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't think I've ever seen an original RGB cable for the MegaDrive/Genesis, only the crappy composite AV cable that came with the system.<br /><br />For this console you definitely shouldn't care about whether the cable is &quot;original&quot;. It has a great native RGB output, so just get an unoriginal RGB SCART cable. Even a low quality one is vastly better than the original cables, and it's really the only proper way to play IMO.

It was the original model and it only came with the RF cable/box. I don't know if the Genesis 2 (released here as the Mega Drive 3) was the same.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Sumez wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It has a great native RGB output, so just get an unoriginal RGB SCART cable.</div><br />The problem is, what to do with the other end of the SCART cable...! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> AFAIK, most of the world didn't use this connector, and most consumer TVs around the world didn't have any sort of RGB input. I had certainly never heard of any of this back in the day.<br /><br />I did recently buy SCART cables and a converter to HDMI (not a very good one, it seems, but I could never afford a Framemeister!), but the result was beyond crappy... Connecting the composite video directly to the TV still resulted in a better image quality!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">it's really the only proper way to play IMO.</div><br />I do like NTSC artifacts though, specially on the MD/Genesis, where many games dither colors using vertical bars.
