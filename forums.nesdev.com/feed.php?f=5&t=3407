I'm just wondering something about the story of Dragon Quest/Warrior series. It's a known fact that when playing Dragon Quest/Warrior 1 you play the decendant of Erdrick/Loto, wich his himself the hero of Dragon Quest/Warrior 3.<br />On the beggining of Dragon Quest/Warrior 3, the hero, is aweken for his 16th birthday. It's clearly stated that his father has never been seen again since his born, and he only lives with his mother and his grandfather.<br />At the end of the game, it's clearly stated that the hero has mysteriously dissapered very short after he defeated Zoma, the demon king.<br /><br />My qustion is : How could he even have a descendant if he mysteriously dissapeared ? He hadn't any descendant before stariting the quest, and he mysteriously dissapear right after ending his quest, so I really see no possibility of him to had any child during his life.<br /><br />The only possibility I can see is him returning to Aliahan in the upper world by casting Return/Rura, and so he has mysteriously disapeared in the eyes of the inhabitants of the lower world (=Alfegard). Then one of his decendant returned from Aliahan to Tantagel between DW3 and DW1. This would seem a bit crazy. The other possibility is that the hero quickly made a child with some random lady right after defeating Zoma, and right before disapearing.<br /><br />Also, in Dragon Quest/Warrior 1, you should "proof" that you are the descendant of Erdrick/Loto by collecting 3 of his items (wich you must collect in DQ/W3 in order to finish the game). But what would prevent any decent warrior to collect those 3 items as well and pass himself as the descendant of Erdrich/Loto ?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Jun 11, 2007 11:48 am</p><hr />
