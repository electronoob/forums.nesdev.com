		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Fixed the top left visible sprite and the game complete screen which had an extra character. I think thats all known bugs. Just need to add the &quot;NES&quot; mode with updated music/gfx. Will take me a while cos have a lot of adult distractions coming up, but will release officially once I have that piece done. If anyone else ends up testing, please let me know if/what bugs you find <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Thanks!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That bug is now gone. I didn't finish the game but in general it is working fine.  I think my current computer setting for the key is too fast so because of that I tend to make mistakes but until I figure out the current level I'm stuck it, I cannot test all of it. <br /><br />I never was into puzzle so usually they don't keep my interest long (I always was into action games) but I gave it a try. If I finish it and find anything, I will let you know.<br /><br />Good work! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah in terms of puzzle games, I think this one has fond memories mostly because it was on your calculator so you could play it in class at school, but in terms of gameplay its just OK. Not many levels, and they always seem way too easy or impossible. Originally I was going to build on it to give better levels and more mechanics but since I didn't invent the original and couldn't get ahold of the creator, I figured it wasn't worth it.<br /><br />dougeff, I think what you have is GREAT. I'm guessing it could always be better, but its got all the building blocks you need and there are little things like the comments, etc that you might lose if you just convert it to pdf. Plus I really like how it feels like you're building your first game and closer to someone learning than a full on expert, which makes it easier to follow as a beginner. Is there something specific about it that makes you want to rewrite it? Obviously I've hit a couple pitfalls but that's an important part of learning. Heck, that's why I did my first &quot;game&quot; in assembly cos I didn't want to skip important knowledge... cos I'd much rather struggle with VBLANK and the PPU at the start of my easy project then get 10k lines into a complex game only to have a weird glitch happen and no underlying knowledge/experience to figure it out.
