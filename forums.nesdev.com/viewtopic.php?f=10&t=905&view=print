		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Greetings all! 
<br />
<br />I was curious if anyone out there has attempted, or has information about, creating a NES cartridge *completely* from scratch: case and all.  
<br />
<br />So has anyone attempted to mold their own NES cart?  Are there any (legal) issues with making a replica of a standard Nintendo cartridge, or should I go the Tengen route and design my own?  How about a custom design with an EEPROM window?
<br />
<br />----
<br />
<br />I've been looking around for information about casting plastic, making molds, etc. and it looks quite do-able.  But I don't want to repeat effort, especially if others have found this to be more difficult than one would think.
<br />
<br />Personally, I never liked the idea of tearing up an existing cartridge since there will only ever be so many of 'em out there.  Memblers seems to be making some serious progress on Squeedo, so I figured that someone should try approaching things from the other end by making a case for the thing. 
<br />
<br />Besides, it would be nice to not only develop custom games, but it'd be nice to share them with less hacker-saavy folks who still run their old consoles. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  <em>That darn lockout chip is another issue completely...</em>

<br />If you're not willing to send technicians out to all your customers' houses to cut pin 4 of frontloaders that have those extra diodes to block the -5V trick, then you're going to need to cut up existing cartridges to get lockout chips anyway.

<br />
<br />True - its all on the same level with modding a playstation to run a burned disc when you get down to it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />So I guess its fair to say that the community is still without a lockout chip replacement?  That's a shame.  I wonder what would be 'fair play' as far as crafting a replacement?  Does using a logic analyzer, or some other EE voodoo count?

<br />IIRC, resin molding can make a good case with screw posts and everything, but the case tends to come out fragile (if  you drop it from more than 3 ft. it could shatter). Vacuum forming on the other hand can use just about any plastic you want (even ABS if you want a really tough case), but it only makes a shell so there would be no screw posts unless you glued them in.

<br />Yikes, I wasn't aware of any fragility issues with resin.  I guess that's what happens when you mix to the wrong resin/hardner ratio?

<br />You didn't mention the idea to create an adaptater with two slots, one with an official cartridge with lockout, and the other pirate without lockout.
<br />This would be a little harder than it would be on the SNES because it is a front loader, but it would still be possible using flat connextions.

<br />
<br />Yeah, that is kind of sucky. What I did to my frontloaders is I just took this little scratcher/poker thing that came with my soldering iron, and I just pulled pin 4 right out of the chip itself. I didn't just bend the pin up out of the board, I pulled the pin out of the chip. I don't know too much about legalty of NESdev in general, or about the legalty of the redesigned famicom, but I totally own a Yobo FC console that my brother bought for me, and I'll be using this for dev testing, because it's lockout free. I think, at least. Their real cheap to buy, only $30 dollars for mine. They also work VERY well. Not compatible with CV3 at all. Weird graphical glitches.

<br />
<br />For lockout chips, we could have a seperate connector for it on the cart maybe.  Could even be detachable.  On the next board I prototype I'm gonna try using the gloptop CICs from Mario/Duckhunt through it's edge connector.  It's just 6 pins.

<br />
<br />one of the biggest things you have to watch when making your own carts is the bevel on the underside of the NES cart. you cant just make a bevel like on nintendo's carts.... you either have to make the cartridge thinner with curved corners so that it will move up into the connector above the bevels.... or just use a 90 degree angle in place of the bevels.

<br />
<br />I'm sure it's all fair.  As long as it's a replacement rather than an exact copy (the latter would be pretty much impossible anyways).
<br />
<br />A logic analyzer won't do much for us, all the good stuff is inside the chip.  I've got pics of the ROM inside the chip (thanks to neviksti), but I don't know how the memory is organized or what the CPU core is exactly (other than it's 4-bit and possibly by Sharp).  I'm pretty sure I could make a replacement if I could disassemble that.

<br />I only got that from a talk with one of the guys over at playmessiah (he said that was about the cost to get a single mold made even in China). Maybe he meant all the molds for the whole unit (this was most likely about the controller since the nex was way off yet), instead of a mold for just 1 part.

<br />
<br />Yep.  Airborne fiberglass particles, sounds real healthy!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> 
<br />Sawing the PCB apart sounds pretty dirty, but it'd be something.
<br />
<br />It'd be the same style for the detachable version.  The boards would connect with a 6-pin dual-row header.  If it needed to be detachable, the NES board side of it could probably use a female connector.  But then the case needs to be opened to detach it, so I guess that would make sense if I can find some regular screws to replace the security screws.

<br />
<br />Cool.  That jives with what I've been reading lately; I haven't stopped researching all this since I first posted here.  Injectors are expensive, and the actual mold takes a huge amount of know-how and time to develop: a lot like software, really.   If I were to go that route, I'd likely have to work with a wood mold or something I can fine-tune before settling on a more permanent prototype.
<br />
<br />If I had unlimited access to a CNC machine, this would be a lot easier. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />Thanks to your input, and that of others, I'm actually going to try some casts with rubber molds and resin.  Beyond that, I may take your suggestion and try some heavy guage vacuum molding - have you tried this by chance?
