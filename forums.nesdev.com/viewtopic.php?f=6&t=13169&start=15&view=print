(The timbre varies too.)

(Unfortunately, rates #4 and #12 are an octave plus a tritone apart, 1793 cents)<br />* Rates #7, #8, #9, #11, and #15 are all about 6-8 cents more sharp. Rates #7 and #15 are mostly unaffected (being a little flat on 2A03), rate #11 is improved (being too flat on 2A03, so 2A07 in A440 12TET) but rates #8 and #9 are moved out of A440 12TET.<br />* Rate #14 is 23 cents more sharp. This causes more notes to be in A440 12TET, but they're not the same ones as in 2A03 tuning.<br /><br />.... of course, I tried to run my generated DPCM import script and famitracker crashed.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks, lindariq! That saves a lot of manual labor, again. <br /><br />I wouldn't worry about the auto-import. It's not much of a job to hand pick some with those tables as a guide. <br /><br /><br />It looks like i may be able to make a fairly region-consistent version of the song without exploding the filesize too much. I estimate going from 132 to 626 bytes for all the divisor samples needed if the sound of it checks out fine, or if not, some more.  As a bonus, the note range will be a bit more complete, perhaps for use in some other song. <br /><br />I suppose keeping the size super small is a criteria that mostly applies to the scenario where music using .dmc:s is everywhere (since they'd then need to be accessed everywhere), but since i've isolated use of them to menus and perhaps story, i probably don't need to be that frugal.
