<br />
<br />You definitely don't want to do DSP on RF video or even any video DSP with the Powerpak, it's so not equipped for that (needs ADC, DAC and RGB encoder). The reason why the 32X was feasible was because the MD outputs RGB, probably has a derivative of the pixel clock on the cart connector and IIRC the sync signals too.
<br />
<br />You could do a Delta-sigma audio expansion output though with an output + resistor + cap (formed as a low pass filter) using the 20Mhz clock. That could be mixed in with the normal audio output using resistors.
<br />
<br />If you really want special video, what you could do is at the start of vblank, write the mapper to tell it to count down to active video where it would overlay it's video by switching between two synced composite signals. There wouldn't really be any processing, but it would still require something other than Powerpak and still be nearly pointless IMO.

<br />Would it be practical to install a small PCB or similar inside the cart containing a video processor+DAC genlocking with the NES's video, and assign more pins from a PowerPak FPGA to communicate with the video processor?  Maybe not, since the extra board might be hard to fit inside the cart, and could be very messy to put inside...
<br />
<br />Would it be just better to use the flicker methods mentioned in the first post in this thread instead of genlocking?

<br />
<br /><ul><strong>1.  Attribute Flicker for Extra Palettes:</strong> Have a mapper flicker between palette pairs for extra palettes, alternating within 8x1 pixel silvers (in BG and/or sprites).<br /><br /><strong>2.  Pixel Flickering for Extra Color Depth:</strong> Have a mapper flicker between two or three colors (in checkerboard/diagonal patterns) of the same palette for extra colors in the palette (in BG and/or sprites).<br /><br /><strong>3.  Ideas 1 + 2:</strong> Have a mapper do both at the same time.<br /><br /><strong>4.  Tile-Based Layers:</strong> Have a mapper help render layers (and pseudo-sprites) by tiles (or 8x1 pixel silvers - allowing for smooth vertical scrolling).  Usually, horizontal scrolling can only be as smooth as by 8 pixels, due to NES limitations.  The mapper can also support smooth by pixel horizontal scrolling over monochromatic areas 8x1 pixels or greater.  Combinable with ideas 1 and/or 2.  If the whole screen needs horizontal scroll, the PPU's horizontal scroll register could be used.<br /><br /><strong>5.  Whole Screen Palette Flicker:</strong> Have a mapper render its own pixels and colors - through using a whole screen psuedo-palette made by swapping between two (or three) fields of alternating patterntable pixels and 8x1 pixel attributes.  Is two or three the better here?</ul>
<br />
<br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> Reworded ideas 4 and 5 a bit to be more clear.

This will result in the artifact pattern going through three different phases for a given pixel (over three frames), rathern than alternating between two. This might make your effect look better. In Nestopia with the NTSC filter enabled you should be able to tell when you're enabling the PPU late enough in the frame (examine Battletoads first to see the distinctive dot crawl pattern you get).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Definitely idea 4. Multi-screen scrolling sounds awesome, however the problem is that 8 horizontal scrolling pixels shoul remain the same color, and that handsome hardware would be required for this. However, vertical scrolling could look fine, and this sounds far better than anoying flickering.

<br />I just tried that (<a href="http://strfr.freehostia.com/downloads/serial.nes" class="postlink">http://strfr.freehostia.com/downloads/serial.nes</a>, you MUST right and do Save Target/Link As or copy inside the browser)...and it looks even more of an acid trip!   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  While I could probably fix some of the color's weird diagonal effects, I wouldn't be able to control some of the others'.
<br />
<br />I reworded ideas 4 and 5: they were a little awkwardly written; see my previous post in this thread.
<br />
<br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> I added a demo demonstrating tile-based parallax scrolling, see the site <a href="http://strfr.freehostia.com/nes.shtml" class="postlink">here</a>, or download it at <a href="http://strfr.freehostia.com/downloads/choppy.zip" class="postlink">http://strfr.freehostia.com/downloads/choppy.zip</a> - you need to right click on the link and do Save Target/Link As or copy in the browser.  What do you guys think about the demo?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I noticed how blargg's 3-phase NTSC demo turned white pixels into cyan, magenta, and yellow.  I tried experimenting with this using a single grey palette ($0f, $2d, $10, $30), and it turned out to be a pretty decent looking palette.  You can see <a href="http://strfr.freehostia.com/nes.shtml#colorful" class="postlink">here</a>.  Download <a href="http://strfr.freehostia.com/downloads/colorful.zip" class="postlink">here</a>.  I think I now see why blargg suggested to turn on the PPU late...;)
<br />
<br />Using 3 pixel dithering patterns, that would allow for 20^3 = 8000 colors; but that would include very crude dithers such as those putting black and a little of (what the PPU digitally sees as) white together.  The 20 figure was from the distinct 3-pixel combinations from the 4 colors of the palette; the ^3 was from the three dot crawl phases (cyan-ish, magenta-ish, yellowish).
<br />
<br />Tokumaru, if you still have problems, you might want to try <a href="http://proxyhustle.com" class="postlink">proxyhustle.com</a>; see if that works.
