		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just finished making a build Mesen that runs under Linux and I was wondering if some people would be willing to test it on their end to see if it works (or crashes!).<br />It runs under Mono (only tested Mono 4.2.1 - I assume any recent version will work) and requires SDL2 to be installed.<br /><br />Building requires clang or gcc, Mono/XBuild and SDL2.  It comes with a very basic makefile - just run &quot;make&quot; and then &quot;make run&quot; to start the emulator.<br />There's also a prebuilt binary here: <a href="http://www.mesen.ca/MesenLinuxPreview.zip" class="postlink">[linux preview download]</a>  (This was built on Ubuntu 16.04 - if you get a popup asking to download the microsoft C++ runtime, you are missing some dependencies)<br /><br />The main issues remaining at the moment are:<br />-Gamepads aren't supported (yet)<br />-Automatic updates won't work<br />-Netplay doesn't automatically add port forwarding rules to the router (UPnP)<br />-Fullscreen mode doesn't hide the taskbar<br /><br />Beyond that, everything else should work (including debugging, netplay (works cross-platform!), NSF player, etc.)<br />The code itself is almost identical between the Windows &amp; Linux versions - the only portions that differ being the Video/Audio/Input handling (DirectX vs SDL), so most things should be ok.<br />There is a bunch of features I haven't had the time to test, so I definitely expect some things to be broken beyond what I just listed, though.<br /><br />Also, for some reason, performance seems to be worse than the Windows build (e.g ~30% slower).<br />But I've only tested on a VM, so that may be part of the reason.<br /><br />If you encounter any issue or crash with the Linux version, please let me know in this thread.

One: the disassembly and memory viewer both seem to be using some random proportional font instead of a monospaced one, and two: the memory viewer is doing something very odd:<div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

If all else fails, you could find a free font, like good old <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Droid+Sans+Mono" class="postlink">DSM</a>, and bundle it. If that's too big, you could bundle a bitmap font.<br /><br />I plan to try Mesen after I've upgraded my laptop to Xubuntu 16.04 &quot;Xenial&quot;. It currently runs 14.04 &quot;Trusty&quot; because that was the newest when I began my last major paid project, and I didn't want to do a major upgrade right in the middle.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the suggestion - I bundled DroidSansMono (it's pretty small) and automatically install it to ~/.fonts on startup, seems to work pretty well.<br />Also reduced the default font size for the debugger because DSM looked ridiculously big.<br /><br />I'm not sure how hard it would be to build on Ubuntu 14, probably just depends on the compiler you have installed.<br />The code uses the C++17 filesystem api, which apparently is only available in GCC 5.3+ (Dec 2015).

I'll try and fix these tomorrow.<br /><br />For the audio issue, what does the &quot;Device&quot; dropdown contain in the audio config window?<br />I'm thinking it might have multiple devices with the same name and it doesn't pick the right one after you change any other setting.<br /><br />A bit unrelated, but how is the audio latency? On my VM it's pretty terrible (e.g 300-400ms real latency with the latency set to 50ms), but I think that might just be due to the VM itself as I don't really see any reason why it would be so high based on the code.<br /><br />Also, I just finished adding gamepad support if you feel like giving it a try.
