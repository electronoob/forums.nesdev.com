Haha! I love that in Spinal Tap. That whole movie is great.<br /><br />Yeah, with my game in general, I hope to take it to eleven. My title screen won't really be THAT special, it'll probably just be the title with some lightning.

The decoder is finally working, and I successfully switched over to the compressed name table for my title screen display. I added a few bytes to the data in order to simplify the decompression code, so the total size of my name table comes out to 128 bytes: a programmer-friendly number if ever there was one.<br /><br />So, what does 86.67% compression look like? Glad you asked:<br /><br /><img src="http://img401.imageshack.us/img401/431/bioniccommanderwe5.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I decomposed the title screen into 6 regions. I used layering, so some regions appear in two separate sections onscreen, even though there's only one region defined in the data.<br /><br />Region #0 (Solid Fill Mode): The dark green background (covers the whole screen)<br />Region #1 (Solid Fill Mode): The two horizontal bars above and below the title<br />Region #2 (Solid Fill Mode): The light green background behind the title<br />Region #3 (String Fill Mode): The word <em>Bionic</em> (lots of duplicate tiles)<br />Region #4 (Ascending Fill Mode): The word <em>Commander</em> (no duplicate tiles)<br />Region #5 (String Fill Mode): The copyright notice<br /><br />I'm no master artist, but I really dig that chrome effect.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3719">SecretServiceDude</a> — Sun Oct 26, 2008 10:12 pm</p><hr />

The one I linked to is not it. It's a mix of RLE, LZ, and some variations of those. There are 7 possible types of compression, and the compressor indicates the one that was used for a particular run using the top bits of the command byte, like SecretServiceDude was doing, but with less types of compression.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Oct 26, 2008 4:04 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Banshaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />How well would if fare to compress data for the name table/map data for a side scroller?<br /></div><br />This kind of compression does not work well for level data, at least if applied directly to tile data. Most (if not all) NES games use a basic block (the metatile) size of more than 8x8. The use of metatiles by itself is already a compression scheme, and then you usually have others on top of this one. So you should first decide on the size of the basic blocks that make up your map (usually 16x16 pixels, 2x2 tiles) and how to encode them, then you decide what kind of compression to use on top of that.<br /><br />Saving some RAM for the maps will probably help a lot, because you'll be able to buffer whatever the decompression algorithm outputs, and use that data for collision as well as for updating the nametables little by little.<br /><br />Anyway, the best compression algorithm to apply on your metatiles will depend on the nature of your maps, what kind of redundancy they have. RLE will always save some space, since I can hardly think of a game that doesn't have wide areas of repeated blocks. An adaptive scheme like the one presented by SecretServiceDude could work well, because it has different types of compression, and at least one of them will be able to do something to a specific piece of data. It kinda reminds me of a <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/docs/smwcompress.txt" class="postlink">compression scheme</a> used by Nintendo in SNES and Gameboy games. I don't know if any NES game used it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Oct 26, 2008 3:44 pm</p><hr />

That's an awesome idea! Storing the NT address directly in the data is pure genius. That'll make my decompression code much cleaner to boot.<br /><br />You're totally right about the unused bit 5 allowing for additional fill modes. Offhand, I can't think of any other fill modes that would benefit me presently, but once I start adding other screens (cut scenes, menus, etc.) perhaps their layouts will open up some possibilities. For now, I think I'll save that bit for a rainy day. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />It's really cool bouncing ideas back and forth with you guys.

Hey, glad the idea worked! I plan to do something involving the chunking method for my title screen (though I might actually load a lot of it with plain code and little data). Looks like you've got quite the compression scheme.<br /><br />I see in your first byte that you could actually have 7 different fill modes if you used bit 5. Do you plan on using this for anything?<br /><br />Also, you know, to save time, since you're already using 2 bytes to define X and Y, you could just put the PPU address in there instead of X/Y coords. Well, only 12 bits of it are unique, as the high 4 bits are always 0010 for the NT address. So instead of:<br /><br />%ff-xxxxx ---yyyyy<br /><br />you could have:<br /><br />%ff--hhhh llllllll<br /><br />where h represents the 4 real MSB of the name table ID and l is the LSB. So for example, you want a tile on name table #0 to start at tile 2,4, you'd normally define it like so:<br /><br />%ff-00010 ---00100<br /><br />Where you could define it as:<br /><br />%ff--0000 10000010<br /><br />where 000010000010 is $082, which is the low 12 bits of the NT address $2082. And if you do it this way, you could actually store stuff on any name table, if you wanted to do some scrolling.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat Oct 25, 2008 9:55 pm</p><hr />
