The mirroring is simply a side effect of ignoring those bits.</div><br />Makes sense now.  I had thought it was the other way around, i.e. the mirroring happened intentionally (as in someone had to go the extra mile to make it happen).  Yay for people who can explain hardware.

Writing $2006 will override whatever you did to $2005. You should get rid of those writes to $2006. (Writing all 0s to it will have the same effect as writing 0s to $2005 so in this case it doesn't matter here, but when you start actually scrolling it will matter.)<br /><br />See this if you want to know all the gritty details: <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/The_skinny_on_NES_scrolling" class="postlink">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/The_skinny_on_NES_scrolling</a><br /><br />(Not really necessary reading, but if you ever want to know what's really going on with $2005/2006 this is it.)

I will eventually have to master scrolling in both horizontal and vertical directions.</div><br />Despite what the others here may say, I too think it's extremely complicated.  It all has to do with how it all works under the hood/behind the scenes (meaning how $2000, $2005, and $2006 affect the PPU internally, and even more specifically how they affect the PPU depending on what it's doing at that moment in time).<br /><br />In my time (during which I haven't written much actual code, and only semi-recently have had the ability to test things on actual hardware vs. emulators), I've had to do two things in two different programs (and at different times/places within the programs): one required me to write $00/$00 to $2005 (which is the most common situation for simple things -- aforementioned threads go over it), and another case where I had to write $3F/$00 to $2006 (and I now understand how/why that was needed) and I think writing $00/$00 $2005 (but I could be remembering wrong; but I do remember the order mattered, as has already been mentioned/discussed/documented).<br /><br />The tricky part is understanding/acknowledging that those registers can, in some way or another, affect scrolling depending on what the PPU is doing at that moment in time or what has been previously written.  As you can see there's a very intricate relationship between those 3 registers and the PPU internals.<br /><br />I find the SNES/SFC a significantly easier console to work on in this regard (from a programmer's perspective that is).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Think of the X and Y scroll as 16 bits. The bottom 5 or so bits of X are stored elsewhere, so the $2006 write trash all the top X Bits, and all Y and nametable select bits, that's why you have to set both $2005 and $2000 nametable bits. The nametable selection bits are just the top of the X and Y scroll. Scroll is just the lower part, basically.<br /><br />And the 1st set scroll will be controlled by the same latch as the PPU $2006 latch, so you can reset with reading $2002 if you want, but it should be in line with your vblank code.

The 9th bit of the X scroll selects between left and right name tables, while the 9th bit of the Y scroll selects between the top and bottom name tables.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A useful thing to do when you get around to scrolling worlds is to store horizontal and vertical scroll into 16-bit variables, use the low bytes to set the X/Y scrolls, and use the LSB of the two high bytes to set the name table address, thus potentially having two 16-bit X and Y coordinates.  Of course, you'd have to handle the wraparound in the Y scroll from 239 to 0, or vice versa, yourself.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just writing to agree with doppelganger.<br /><br />Sometimes I wonder if we should drop the &quot;name table selection bits&quot; name altogether and just call them the high bits of the scroll, because newbies often have a lot of trouble seeing how the two things connect in order to scroll over bigger worlds. But then I figure this wouldn't be of much help because there's still a clear separation between the name tables because of the way they are mapped, and the configurable mirroring doesn't make it any easier either.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The image is composed of four blocks, which are each composed of 960 smaller blocks, which are each composed of 64 even smaller blocks (pixels). So taking all these into account, scrolling consists of three distinct parts for each axis: nametable select (1 bit), tile select (5 bits), and pixel select (3 bits). From a programming perspective, this view seems of less utility than treating it as a 9-bit pixel position on a 512x480-pixel image.
