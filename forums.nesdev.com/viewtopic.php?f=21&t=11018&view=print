I mean the bit where PAL's chroma goes through a [0.5 0.5 0] vertical filter.<br /><br />There are definitely examples of games for consoles that had a more vibrant career in PAL-land, such as Mayhem in Monsterland for the C64.

Unsurprisingly, YouTube messed up the video by scaling it down.<br /><br />Here's the original video on Dropbox (156 MB, losslessly compressed with ZMBV i.e. the DOSBox codec): <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/13oxoo7kmuyl666/palette-capture2-zmbv.avi">https://www.dropbox.com/s/13oxoo7kmuyl6 ... 2-zmbv.avi</a><!-- m -->.<br /><br />If possible, you should download the original file from Dropbox, as it seems like their video player uses an internally converted version. Also note that half of the scanlines on the video are redundant because of deinterlacing done by the capture dongle. Aspect ratio is also wrong (or at least different than on my CRT).<br /><br />You probably know this already, but to recap and as a note to self and others:<br /><br />The obvious first thing that can be seen from the uncompressed video is that even the &quot;normal&quot; colors aren't uniform when displayed by this USB capture dongle. But this fact makes it very easy to see how the even and odd scanlines from the &quot;uniform&quot; colors on left and right are combined to form the color on the bottom (and why the order of the colors on the bottom matters).<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />that the scanline period doesn't bear the same relationship<br /><br />I wonder how much of this is due to the 15602 Hz horizontal sync vs. the standard 15625. The standard PAL scanline is 283.7516 periods of the 4.43361875 MHz color subcarrier. The NES scanline is slightly longer: 284.1667 periods. For one thing, these chroma-blending filters may depend on the correct scanline period.<br /><br />Another issue is that the 2A07 might not even be outputting the same color on each scanline. The part of the 2A07's color encoder that negates the phase on odd scanlines might have been implemented cheaply. That would need an oscilloscope (or a decap of the 2A07) to test properly.

I mean, no matter what kind of signal it produces, the fact stands that my CRT (Samsung 14&quot;) and my LCD HDTV (Samsung as well) both are happy to eat the signal and to do the chroma blending (producing uniform colors). So no matter how it actually works under the hood, seems to me like it should be exploitable.<br /><br />Disclaimer: a lot of guesswork coming up. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Assuming that we can trust the capture, it seems like the PPU is outputting separate hues on consecutive scanlines of the same colors. From a quick glance and a comparison to the NTSC PPU palette it seems like, e.g. color $22 produces something close to alternating lines of $21 and $23. However, this doesn't explain why the resulting hues are slightly different <s>e.g. for the case $21-$22:<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<br />
	</div>&#40;It&#39;s not that visible to the naked eye, though, as you too mentioned.&#41;</s><br /><strong>EDIT: Struck out because this was a bad example. Even if PPU was using adjacent phases to produce the color, $21 and $22 wouldn't produce the same hue on alternating scanlines ($21 and $23 would). That said, even the case $21-$23 produces non-matching hues on alternating scanlines.</strong><br /><br />Could it be that PAL PPU intentionally outputs two separate hues on even/odd scanlines, assuming the TV will average them out to produce a hue in-between the two other hues? Why it would do that, though, I have no idea.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The standard PAL scanline is 283.7516 periods of the [PAL] color subcarrier. The NES scanline is slightly longer: 284.1667 periods. For one thing, these chroma-blending filters may depend on the correct scanline period.<br /></div>A random source I found claimed the delay line is tuned to exactly 283.5 periods of subcarrier (&quot;Monochrome and Colour Television by R. R. Gulati&quot;). Demodulation of color in PAL apparently was originally specified to work by having a bandpass filter at the color subcarrier frequency, running that through a delay line, and adding or subtracting the delayed signal. This implies that the color signal is not only delayed vertically by a half scanline, but also displaced horizontally by a pixel at 576i or so (14.75÷4÷fsubcarrier).<br /><br />The NES's substantially slower scanlines should cause the delay line to be off by enough to produce a perceptible horizontal displacement of chroma signal; it should be close to 1 whole NES pixel (1.25÷1.5).<br /><br />As to the actual phase produced by the NES ... I'm kinda lost. I took the frame from the video with colors $21 and $22 and calculated some angles:<br />Color $21 is made of ... let's say, cyan and periwinkle ... and converting those using gimp's R470 YCrCb filter, I get a Cr and Cb of {-22,+58}/128 (111°) and {-63,+24}/128 (159°),  136° blended.<br />Color $22 is made of ... periwinkle and lavender? ... and for these I find Cr,Cb of {19,58}/128 (72°) and {-39,58}/128 (124°), 109° blended.<br />The blended numbers are sufficiently close to the expected 135° and 105°, but I'm really not clear what's going on with the separate pre-blending components.<br /><br />Anyway, we don't need an oscilloscope, because televisions already have the necessary bandwidth. Taking the composite output of two separate PAL sources (consoles, VCR, whatever) and connecting them to a TV's s-video input (with the NES as &quot;chroma&quot; and displaying a solid color) should let us see what the relative phase is of colorburst relative to the rest of the signal on the line, because clock drift between the two video sources will cause the chroma signal to drift to where the burst signal is visible.<br /><br />Lacking an s-video port, one could probably even just manage something with some resistors or a capacitor to mix the two video signals together; the only important thing is that it get the synchronization timing from one source and the color from the NES.
