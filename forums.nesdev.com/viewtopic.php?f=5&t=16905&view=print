The electrons coming in are all the same.<br /><br />The way I understand the separation via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_mask" class="postlink">shadow mask</a>: if the mask covers 1/3 of the space you can see a different 1/3 of the screen through it from any given angle. By placing the 3 electron guns (and the mask holes) at the right angles, you can line those spaces up with the intended phosphors.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Distance between guns themselves and the focal point determines how far the mask is from the inner screen surface. Color purity is perfect (beams only land on their intended color) as long as the mask distance doesn't change, and it will when you have a white image for a long time, leading to small discoloration near sides of the screen. Newer aswell as lager tubes use invar mask which can be &quot;driven&quot; much harder before it deforms enough to cause color purity problems. Not to be confused with convergence which is the alignment of the beams to produce a single spot. On TVs in particular convergence is not very good near the edges, with blue and red breaking up quite visibly causing to small discoloration in edge details. Convergence is primarly controlled by the deflection system. The narrower the tube and its deflection angle the harder it will be to maintain good convergence aswell as focus, both mechanical (shadow mask distance and alignment from screen) and electrical. Flat tubes make it even harder to achieve than curved tubes, plus flat tubes weight a whole lot more due to needing whole lot more glass to withstand pressure from outside world.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sort of. Not in the way you're thinking, where the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJbGVEfDbwY" class="postlink">mirrors completely recapitulate the deflection coils</a> of a conventional CRT.<br /><br />Modern &quot;laser&quot; projectors often use the LASER diode (and/or diodes) to get a very narrow-band light source for higher energy efficiency and better gamut, and then reflect that light off a DLP array (and all of the pixels in that are, in fact, mirrors)
