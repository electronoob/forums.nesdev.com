		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I've got my copynes up and running again, and I've got a stash of new Sachen games...
<br />
<br />Well, my plan was to figure out how to dump them using the CopyNES Win32 Client, and then once I had the proper working plugin &amp; mapper / Unif boardname, dump them with Bootgod's db to submit the results.  What I am running into, however, is that I my plugin / mapper combinations that worked on the win32 client don't work on bootgod's db software.  In an example, Bingo 75, the output of the .nes file in nestopia give me:
<br />Ines: mapper 144 set
<br />Board: AGCI 50282
<br />Board: 64k PRG-ROM
<br />Board: 32k CHR-ROM
<br />On the one I dumped from the CopyNES Software,
<br />and:
<br />Ines: mapper 144 set
<br />Board: AGCI 50282
<br />Board: 64k PRG-ROM
<br />Board: 8k V-RAM
<br />On the NesCartDB Software
<br />using the same plugin (Sachen3.bin) and mapper (144), and unif board (UNL-SA-72008)
<br />
<br />Has someone run into discrepancies like this?
<br />Is there something I can set to make the db software dump the same way the other software did?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So the PRG ROM dumps the same between the software, but the DB software doesn't detect the CHR ROM?
<br />
<br />The only reason the NES DB software should report 8K VRAM is if it was unable to detect any CHR ROM.
<br />
<br />Are you using an adapter w/ resistors on the data lines or just plugging the cart in? I know CopyNES in general has a tough time with Sachen carts. It could be that the system crashes after the PRG has been dumped. Not sure why that would only happen with the DB software though.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/plugins/sachen3.bin" class="postlink">Here</a> is an updated plugin with a small change. Unlikely it will make a difference but it's worth a try.
<br />
<br />Please copy &amp; paste the dump log here when you've tried it with this updated version.

I am aware that some Sachen carts require that sort of adapter, but my plan was to first dump the games that didn't need one and then see if I can pull off the others once I've made an adapter.   Do you think this could be part of the issue?

<br />
<br />Would you mind emailing the one dumped with copynesw as well as the one dumped with the DB software? I'd like to take a look at the 2, maybe it will shed some light on what's going on. My email is in the about box of the DB program.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello,
<br />
<br />Thanks for your help with this!
<br />
<br />I sent you the files, but I found out some new information in my testing that is probably more useful anyway:
<br />The string that I put into the CHR / PRG field is what was causing the dumps to be bad.  I'm not sure if it's too long, or contains bad chars (=, .), but both Mahjong Partner and Bingo 75 dumped fine with the nescartdb software once I stopped putting in the CHR / PRG fields.  Here is what I was putting into them that caused the grief:
<br />
<br />Mahjong Partner (Sachen5.bin):
<br />CHR: MX 27C512PC-15 M15673 TAIWAN B933 VR = 12.5V
<br />PRG: UNMARKED
<br />
<br />Bingo 75:
<br />CHR: MBM27C256A-25 8901 M39 12.5V PGM
<br />PRG: SB8924 MMC27C256Q 25C

<br />
<br />The new system allows you to enter all that chip info in a better way. It might be easier if you waited with unlicensed / oddball carts until it goes online. I'm going to have to manually transfer / convert all the submissions from the past ~2 months as it is <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />
