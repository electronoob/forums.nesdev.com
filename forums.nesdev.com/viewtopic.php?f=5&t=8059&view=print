		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello.  I am thinking of starting a business that replaces the Save RAM batteries in ANY cartridge based system...not just NES but also SNES, all the Game Boys, N64, Genesis, you name it.  I'd also install battery holders (when possible) to facilitate easy replacement of the battery in future.
<br />
<br />The idea came about when my girlfriend told me that the internal clock on her Pokemon Gold cartridge drained the Save RAM battery.  The truth, as we know it, is that the retro systems have lost manufacturer support and have expired warranties, so it is up to us to keep these games alive.  However, not everyone has the tools or expertise to do this themselves.
<br />
<br />Now, I realize that there probably are about a dozen other companies that already provide these services, but most gamers in Seattle, for example, would not pay the high cost of shipping their cartridge to a technician in Miami.
<br />
<br />I want your opinions on this...is this kind of business practical?  Is it profitable?

<br />
<br />And I don't think it's worth competition for such a small thing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's a novel idea I would say if you're passionate about it go for it.  The good thing is there isn't much investment to get started.  So the only thing you'd be out is your time if it flopped.  Honestly I would see it being difficult to gain enough business to really make anything of it though.  I just don't see a high enough demand for it.  Who knows though, in trying to get going you may find an idea of something else that is maintainable and profitable.  
<br />
<br />One related thing that if you got running I think people would ask for is for you to dump their saves.  I know you can replace the battery without dumping and reloading the save.  But with emulators and all people may be interested in making a backup of a save or moving a save over to their emulator.  This would require more work and tools obviously though, but worth consideration I'd think.
