The NEStopia YUV palette is what I keep loaded in my Photoshop swatches, so this uses that. It is a noticeably less saturated palette than others. <br /><br />Also, this wouldn't look good if you are running an older version of FCEUX (before 2.20, I think, when the palette was updated to correct an erroneous entry for palette #23).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually, I think if I were to go about this, I'd probably reduce the total color count and go with roughly monochromatic backgrounds to reduce visual competition with the foreground, also taking a nod from Drag's orange fog suggestion at the sunset:<br /><br /><br />This would free up a dedicated HUD palette as well.

That's totally out of the question.<br />Level 1, 2 and 4 already have the perfect colors, so I won't change anything in them.<br /><br />As I said earlier, for level 3, I guess I'll just have to go through all possible combinations with my graphics artist after all.

If you change the building to blue it is effectively changing the light of the scene. With the limited NES palette I don't think a lot can be done in terms of light moods, so a little bit of a stretch has to be done in order to get such results.<br /><br />The ones you guys decided on are nice tho.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i think i'm agreeing with nesrocks here, it makes me think of how a spruce forest goes from mid-dark cold green to all reds and oranges in the world during sundown. It's a very strong means for symbolizing evening/sunset this way, even if it in reality is just a small portion of the evening.  <br /><br />The one you picked is more dusky, which i think is pretty cool, too!<br /><br /><br />Here's an idea though. You could try and replace a few clouds with stars coming out. Just by a little during evening, and then some more during night. I think it could really help conveying the sense of time shifting, and require only a very few extra characters in memory. I've made it with a little as two, but that's on the conservative side.

We had yellow, solid red, purplish/pinkish. But it always had the problem that it hurt my eyes. After playing level 1 and 2, the color in level 3 just didn't look very pleasant. That's why I decided for the dim blue and the gray clouds.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">WheelInventor wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Here's an idea though.

We literally used all 256 tiles, both in the background and for the sprites.<br /><br />Also, the game is basically finished. The only reason why it's not out yet is all the external stuff: Artworks, manual, box etc. I will include one more sound effect that came to my mind in the meantime, but I won't do any major stuff anymore like a dynamic background image.

But the whole additional stuff: Manual, package etc. still takes time.<br />And in the meantime, I optimized and altered the ROM here and there since I still have the time to do these alterations. (Manual, box artwork and all the stuff are done by other people.)
