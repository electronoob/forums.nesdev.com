Somebody, like many here, who have worked on said system and saw the types of tradeoffs he did.<br /><br />But he should have had a decompression routine determine which type of tile to output when rendering, instead of changing them all to one type. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Hehe, kidding...sort of. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

What's been done is really, really impressive, but the physics and things leave a lot to be desired especially after playing the non-NES version. He definitely made the right choice when he switched from NES, the game is better for it.<br /><br />Also, there really does appear to be a rom in there. I found and edited some 6502 code in RAM while the prototype (ROM City Rampage) was running. It picked up my change as expected.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Game was on sale on the webpage and was said to run well in Wine, so figured I would try it out myself and purchased it. <br /><br />Doesn't run so well though - sound is completely garbled and apparently if you misconfigure your joypad once there's no way to get back to the joypad settings (re-install probably needed?). <br /><br />So it just proves the point of why I stay away from PC games and prefer my NES instead. hope the embedded ROM will give a better experience...

Yow.</div><br />He mentioned that right from the beginning, way before he moved away from the NES. I think the reason for the MMC5 is the need to color individual 8x8-pixel tiles, as opposed to the regular 16x16-pixel areas. Since everything is so small, he needs that to properly color doors, windows and other tiny details on buildings. Also, I bet he takes advantage of being able to access way more than 256 background tiles at the same time, so he can draw a detailed city without having to bankswitch or update the pattern tables for specific regions

Now you can use it on any real NES/Famicom hardware or any computer having the NES/Famicom emulator, rather than only Windows or Wine or whatever. (Step 6 can be omitted though, and step 4 might be modified on non-Windows computers)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, the ROM turned out to be a disappointment as well. On the upside, the graphics are quite nice, so the MMC5 extra graphics features do show, even if t looks somewhat too static with no animated bg tiles. <br /><br />On the downside, there's no sound at all, neither music nor SFX. It's very glitchy graphically, with flickering screen transitions and lots of sprite flicker, which the constant slowdowns make even worse. Controls seem pretty broken, as trying to get into the car takes an eternity. And there's no intructions about where to go or what to do. Lots of doors and entrances, but seems they can't be accessed. So while it's a bit of a cool MMC5 tech demo, it's a very unfinished product.<br /><br />It does say &quot;Unfinished prototype&quot; in big letters, so I hope it'll be improved to a point where it's playable. At the moment there's nothing fun about playing it, and not really worth even the halved sale price I got it for.<br /><br />Just my 749 cents 'bout it...
