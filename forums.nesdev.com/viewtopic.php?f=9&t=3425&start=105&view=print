<br />Can you save in other games, or is this the only one giving you problems?
<br />
<br />If this is the only game with problems, try saving to a different 8K .sav file on the card.  Also, make sure you're saving properly within the game (I think FF3 doesn't let you save until you finished the first area of the game).
<br />
<br />You may also try reading the .sav file back to your computer and seeing if the saved data shows up in an emulator.

<br />The save file has data in it (when I open it in a hex editor), but it doesn't work in an emulator, and vice versa (emulator save file doesn't work for the powerpak).

<br />Has anyone else tried saving with FF3E?

The game runs, but it's not doing it's MMC2 like bankswitching for graphics. This is most noticable whenever you character attacks his animation is all screwwed up tiles. Is MMC4 support incomplete? I know MMC2 seems to work fine which makes it odd that what I believe is a shared feature isn't in MMC4's mapper file.

<br />Try this:
<br />
<br />1. Load any 8KB file as your battery data for FF3.  It's best if you don't use a typical FF3 save file (e.g. use a battery file for another game).
<br />2. Start the game and get to the first battle (you don't need to save - just get to the first battle).
<br />3. Reset to the boot ROM and write the data out to another (preferably blank) 8K file.
<br />4. Compare the two files and see if the data matches or not.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If the data's exactly the same, then it means FF3 isn't modifying it in any way, which can only mean it's accessing a different portion of the 32K WRAM chip.  For MMC3, only the first 8K should be accessible - maybe bunnyboy made a mistake and a different 8K bank is being swapped in.
<br />
<br />If that's the case, then using a 32K file should fix the problem, since it will capture everything in the WRAM (assuming bunnyboy's fix for larger .sav files works).  Try giving FF3 an enpty 32K .sav file.  Play until the first battle, then reset to boot ROM and save.  Then check to see if there's any non-zero data in the file.  (FF3 uses WRAM for more than just saved data - its sound system, level map decompression, menu system, and battle system all use different portions of WRAM, so by the time the first battle starts, plenty of opportunities will have passed for WRAM data to be modified.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Glad to hear it.  I guess bunnyboy has WRAM A13 and A14 high instead of low, causing the last 8K bank to be swapped in.  This is an error, and he should fix it in a mapper update.  If/when that fix is applied, you will need to extract the good 8K and throw out the bad 24K before using the .sav file with the updated mapper files.  (At least this isn't a boot ROM issue this time...)
<br />
<br />I suspect all MMC3 games (mappers 4, 118, and 119) are likely affected by the bug (possibly other mappers as well, depending on what gets reused from one mapper implementation to the next).
