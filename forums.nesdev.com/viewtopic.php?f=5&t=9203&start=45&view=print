I really don't see the point of this whole discussion. Would you be satisfied if they all went out of business and stopped making them all together?  <br /><br />I think we're better off debating how they should have never discontinued the NES (or should release another).

Are there any legal barriers to someone refabricating the original chips at this point? I don't know what other kinds of patents might still be in effect, but it seems like the problem of chip design is something we might be able to bypass that this point.

And even still getting an exact analog match for sound/video is difficult compared to the digital design of the CPU and all.  Basically the only viable option is to redesign it from the ground up.  But the problem with that is what everyone's complaining about with it not being a perfect match.

It seems to be recruiting volunteer programmers to make what is basically NES software (You can see some 6502 code and yy-chr being used in the introduction video montage).
