<br />Is that possible?
<br />If so, would anyone wanna try with the Jap kid icarus? (it has got save support instead of password)
<br />I got the romdump (dumped myself)

<br />I just wanted to know if this was possible and if someone could do a conversion from fds to ines format.
<br />
<br />My FDS unit is getting worse every time I use it.
<br />And since I like this kid icarus, I was wondering if someone could convert this thing so I can try putting this on a cart for backup purposes and for playing it after my FDS unit will eventually die....

<br />To put it on a cart would still require you to build the custom mapper you referenced. It would really be easier to just hack the individual FDS game to MMC1 like the NES port, but this time use a board with SRAM for the save.

<br />
<br />Actually. You cannot put FDS's SaveRAM code with MMC1, because unless you make a port of the BIOS using MMC1. It is impossible. Disch's WIP ''Doki Doki Panic'' Port uses MMC5 and wrote original routines for the BIOS instead of the original, Technically the SaveRAM is not made yet on his custom homemade BIOS.
<br />
<br />And of course, Look at Loopy's SMB2j+FDS BIOS source for MMC3. The source is messy and not very well commented (using the commercial disassembler IDA PRO) It is downloadable at: <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~olimar/NES/" class="postlink">http://home.comcast.net/~olimar/NES/</a>
<br />
<br />Loopy has a useful thing included in the BIOS explained above: The FDS's Intro and Lag Screens are disabled. Just like it should be.

<br />
<br />But it's all alot of work. You'd be better off hacking the US Kid Icarus to support saving. It's probably alot easier.

Anyway, the FDS emulation is crap, since most emulators use self-empiric things to get it working. I know a few pirated versions of FDS games "ported" into iNES format, but that's it.

<br />
<br />Most FDS games can be emulated fairly easily thanks to Brad Taylor's FDS document that tells you the BIOS function call addresses for important things like LoadFiles(). This is how I added FDS support. Rather than implement all the garbage to work with FDS I just hook any subroutine calls for disk access like LoadFiles() and execute the same thing in C++ code. It beats emulating the actual drive. :p And it loads instantly which is nice.

<br />
<br />I return certain values for certain registers the bios and games may check so it passes through. Really by always returning certain values and hooking subroutines like the LoadFiles() you can get most games running very easily. The hard part is writing all the code to execute each function you want. LoadFiles() is the only one really needed. If you intercept calls to it, the only other thing you need to do would be intercept calls to some other routines so they don't fail but you don't actually have to add them in. 
<br />
<br />I'm just speaking from my experience with my emulator.
