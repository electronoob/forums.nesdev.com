It helps that I had a bit of 6800 assembly in college but it didn't really click much with me then either. It's starting to make since to me now. I think the light came on when I was hacking those game genie codes. Anyway my first program, again something most of you could do in your sleep, is a little man that you can move around the screen. Very basic, but I hope some day to have him dodging obstacles and shooting at enemies and also to be much bigger. He's only one tile large right now.

<br />
<br />Looking at the code, I have to say that you were very careless. You forgot to do any initialization whatsoever. You don't disable interrupts, initialize the stack, wait for the PPU to warm up, nothing.
<br />
<br />Also, you enable PPU rendering right away, and then set up the palette without checking if you are in Vblank.
<br />
<br />You have to pay attention to details like these, or else your programs won't work well on hardware.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It works okay in FCEUX.....uhhh remember to set the scroll to $00 and $00 for now to keep the name table on #1 if you aren't using them, thats what I see. Do that by at the end of the NMI store $00 to the scroll registers, $2005 IIRC, And you do it twice IIRC. Not 100% sure about that though.
<br />
<br />
<br />It's a good start, I've never went to college and in the middle of high school and would reccomend doing 6809 after 6800, It's a lot more registers and a lot easier to do stuff with. 6809 has X and Y 16 bit pointers, A and B 8-Bit accumulators, 2 stacks and it's got lots of nice instruction <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> I like to control HD44780 displays with it, as we have a TON of them for cheap.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Well keep trying to add on or even better, tidy up your code for now and try to find new and more efficent ways of doing stuff.
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />
<br />Haha looks like I just teested the program, the others above me read the program faster then I looked at what it does on the screen.....well thats the last time I be lazy <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />That problem is that you might make a habit out of this. You should be more careful since the beginning to avoid that.
<br />
<br />Before trying on hardware, I suggest you fix the problems I mentioned, and get it to run in more emulators. If you are not doing any crazy effects (raster effects, forced blanking, timing-sensitive effects, and so on), the program should work on all popular emulators. If it doesn't you can bet you are breaking a basic NES rule, and if it works on hardware it shouldn't be considered stable (it might still fail under certain circumstances or hardware revisions).
<br />
<br />So here are some facts you might not know because your program didn't take them into consideration:
<br />
<br /><strong>1.</strong> A lot of parts of the system are at unknown states when it's powered on, so you must perform some basic initialization in order to prepare a stable environment for your program. Disabling IRQs (SEI) and initializing the stack (LDX #$FF; TXS) are common initialization tasks.
<br />
<br /><strong>2.</strong> The PPU needs some time to warm up before it can be safely used. A lot of PPU operations are not available as soon as the system is turned on, so you must wait at least 2 frames before drawing backgrounds, using sprites and setting palettes. You can poll $2002 and wait for 2 VBlanks.
<br />
<br /><strong>3.</strong> PPU memory can only be written to during VBlank or when rendering is off. This means that before setting the palette you must either disable rendering or wait for Vblank, otherwise that transfer might happen at a time it's not allowed to, and all you'll get is visual glitches.
<br />
<br /><strong>4.</strong> Polling $2002 to time the game logic misses VBlanks. If $2002 is read at the exact time VBlank starts (and that happens quite often), the flag will not return set for that frame, causing the game logic to miss a frame, which results in jerky movement and slowdowns. You should look into NMIs (even if all your NMI does is set a flag and the game logic polls this flag instead of $2002).

<br />
<br />@Super-Hamster: Have you looked at <a href="http://nesdev.com/NES101.zip" class="postlink">Michael Martin's NES101 tutorial</a>? It provides a lot of the stuff Tokumaru has mentioned, and code showing how it works, too. It might be a good next step for you. The <a href="http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&amp;threadid=7155" class="postlink">Nerdy Nights</a> tutorials may be good too, though I haven't looked over much of those except the sound ones. Good luck on your endeavors!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Another way to see how to code is to check commercial games. You can debug them in Nintendulator to be on the safe side, if you like. There are also many other debuggers like FCEUX, of course as you know. Be careful though, there are many NES/FC games that also break the rules.
