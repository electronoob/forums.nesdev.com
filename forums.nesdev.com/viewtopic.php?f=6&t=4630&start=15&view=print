<br />Activision's The Music Studio.
<br />
<br />Dwedit is correct: some of the music was taken from the example tunes of Music Studio. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Bogas" class="postlink">Ed Bogas</a> composed all the plagiarized tracks.

<br /><em>(Sorry about the split zip files, these are leftover from explaining the same thing, ironically enough, to JP folks in mixi over a year ago when Cheetahmen remixing was all the next hip thing there)</em>
<br />
<br />Here's a list of the names of the tracks, &amp; their respective games:
<br /><a href="http://www.nanjamonja.com/muzak/tms/bossa.zip" class="postlink">Bossa Nova</a> -&gt; FUZZ POWER &amp; Cheetahmen II's OP

<br /><a href="http://www.nanjamonja.com/muzak/tms/tango.zip" class="postlink">Tango</a> -&gt; FRENCH BAKER

<br /><a href="http://www.nanjamonja.com/muzak/tms/mystery.zip" class="postlink">Mystery</a> -&gt; NINJA ASSAULT
<br />
<br />There were various home computer versions of the editor made (Atari 8-bit, Commodore 64, Amiga, Atari ST, Apple IIGS), so I wouldn't exactly know which one was used. However, given the consistency of the Atari ST's demo tracks &amp; the game itself, I'm willing to bet that version's usage.
<br />
<br />I always wondered why certain tracks in Action 52 sounded awfully similar to the demo tunes of the first Amiga music editor I ever used.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

<br />Thanks for the info.. that was great.  I knew the music was too good to be written by the same dood that made the action 52.  Good to know it was stolen.  LOL
<br />
<br />Knowing that, I wonder where the graphics came from?  I don't really recognize any as stolen, and I thought the graphics weren't THAT bad.  Maybe the guy could only do NES graphics and not code. 
<br />
<br />Anyways, I checked around and the music driver isn't original either.  I found the same driver in a few other games.  I will make a list and stuff later when I do more investigation.
<br />
<br />I don't think Activision made an NES player for the music did they?  Or did they have some "developer" version?  
<br />
<br />Day dreaming davy uses the player as does eliminator boat duel.  The code is slightly different on both (mainly variable allocation) but the code engine seems identical.  I was going to pull the music just for fun and make new NSFs maybe. (I'm sure the NSFs have been ripped at this point though)

<br />Whoa! That's an incredible find! I had The Music Studio on C64, but unfortunately, I can't find the exact version I had online... the one I had used that Five4 song on the titlescreen demo thing, but most of the C64 disk images I find online have a completely different title screen graphic and music. :S If I can dig up my disk, I'll check to see if I recognize any other Action 52 songs on it, because I know mine had a few more songs than what's in that directory.

<br />
<br />Wouldn't it have to be a different driver due to digital PCM used?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The rip with the PCM works on PowerPak, but only to play the PCM and then say &quot;Make your selection now&quot;, after which point it freezes and the controls do nothing. The rip without the PCM works to hear the actual music.<br /><br />You can't spell STREEMERZ without ST. The music of Action 52 Streemerz was obviously based on the Atari ST version of &quot;Calypso&quot;, not the Amiga version whose instruments sounded messy. And &quot;Calypso&quot; in turn seems to be some sort of sound-alike of &quot;Jamaica Farewell&quot;, written by Lord Burgess and recorded by Harry Belafonte, which in turn is based on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zQal3zZu_I" class="postlink">Iron Bar</a>.<br /><br />So we have an Nth generation copy: The ending tune of Podunkian!Streemerz is a sound-alike of Active!Streemerz, which copied Bogas!Calypso note for note, which is a sound-alike for Jamaica Farewell, which borrows Iron Bar. And the first level music of Podunkian!Streemerz, of course, is an homage to Bogas!Calypso with instrumentation more fitting the Bionic Commando game from which the game took its aesthetics.
