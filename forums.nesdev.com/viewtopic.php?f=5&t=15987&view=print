(For example, the number of letters from the texts actually match the NES' resolution.)<br />Looks like they actually created a ROM for this (hence the PowerPak), or what would you say?<br /><br />Does anybody know where the cartridge label comes from? It looks like a remake of the original &quot;Castlevania I&quot; artwork, drawn in the style of today's &quot;Castlevania&quot; artworks.

See for example JoJo's Bizarre Adventure or Symphony of the Night.<br /><br />But Castlevania 1 and 3 were not based on Japanese vampires; they were based on Western ones. By having American writers the show is going to feel more like Bram Stoker's novel and less like Shonen Jump.

But several Castlevania games that take place before it have been release since that, both canon (Lament of Innocence ) and non-canon (Castlevania Legend). Dracula is able to revive every 100 years.

It's one thing for Japanese to do a Stoker-like NES game. It's another to make a TV show in this style.<br /><br />(Besides, &quot;Castlevania&quot; is more Hammer Horror and not so much Bram Stoker's novel. The game even presents itself as a movie reel and Dracula's actor is Christopher Bee/Lee.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Pokun wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">When CV3 was released it was the earliest account of a Belmont killing Dracula.</div><br />That still holds true today. &quot;Legends&quot; is non-canon, as you said. And in &quot;Lament of Innocence&quot;, the Belmont never fought Dracula. He first killed a vampire named Walter Bernhard and then the final boss was the Grim Reaper, with Dracula leaving the scene before that battle.<br /><br />So, it's still canon: Dracula in CV3 has not been resurrected because he had never been killed by that point yet. Trevor Belmont was the first to kill him.<br /><br />My text that you quoted is moot anyway: My assumption was based on a mishearing. I thought he said &quot;who killed Dracula&quot;, but he actually said &quot;who'll kill Dracula&quot;. So, yeah, the show will porbably depict the time frame of CV3 itself.
