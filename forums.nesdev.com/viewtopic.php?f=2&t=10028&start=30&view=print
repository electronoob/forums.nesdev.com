		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Look, it's clear you are pretty lost. It seems you didn't get how NES programming works yet, and it's unlikely you'll figure it out by yourself.<br /><br />The thing is, an .ASM file isn't &quot;converted&quot; to an .NES in the same way that a .BMP file can be converted to .PNG. BMP and PNG are well documented data formats that follow certain standards. But .ASM and .NES are programs (meaning they can contain pretty much anything!), and depending on the assembler used, the .ASM file will have to follow different standards.<br /><br />The best thing you can do right now is follow a tutorial, so that you can get the basic idea of how things work. Try the Nerdy Nights tutorial that has already been suggested, and use the same tools that the author used. Once you understand how the program you write can become a ROM file, you might try different things. There's no point in trying to do something by yourself if you don't even know where to begin.

It is like English vs Spanish, one really does not understand the other, until its translated. Assembler is the program that does the translation.

What I meant by &quot;dialects&quot; is that an .ASM file written for ASM6 won't assemble in NESASM without at least some modifications, even though both work with 6502 code.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><strong>DIS</strong>ASM6 is a <strong>dis</strong>assembler, it's meant to convert binary programs into ASM code, the exact opposite of what you want.<br /><br />Also, you are blindly writing stuff in the command prompt! The &quot;.incbin&quot; line is supposed to be written inside an ASM file, which then needs to be compiled. But like I said before, just including it won't do anything unless you write the code to use those tiles.<br /><br />I'll be honest with you: You are really, really, REALLY lost, you have absolutely no idea what you're doing. Nothing you're trying makes ANY sense. Programming isn't something you guess. You can't just download a bunch of programs and type random stuff hoping it will work. You have to study!<br /><br />We have suggested several times that you follow <a href="http://www.nintendoage.com/pub/faq/NA/nerdy_nights_out.html" class="postlink">this tutorial</a>. Please stop guessing and read this. Believe me, NES programming isn't like Photoshop, which you can poke around and learn by yourself, you won't learn NES programming like this.
