		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So what exactly is Street Fighter 2?  A bunch of sprites, some music and sound effects, and specific animations, hitboxes, and behaviors.  The gameplay comes entirely from the animations, timing, and hitboxes, and priority of moves.  So in order to make any clone of Street Fighter 2, you need to figure out all the animations, hitboxes, and state transitions.  That defines the game mechanics of Street Fighter II.

The (100% non-commercial) projects that get their plugs pulled are the stupid ones that decide that they should send their unfinished progress to gaming blogs and other similar sites and have the name plastered everywhere. The solution isn't to make the NES equivelent of &quot;GNU/gOpenFight&quot; but just to not blatantly scream to everyone that you're cloning Street Fighter II. <br /><br />SFxMM wasn't developed with permission, it was developed quietly as a Mega Man fan game and then capcom was approached. Do you think it was developed as &quot;GNU/kFreeShootJumpGameWithFighers&quot; and then Mega Man was put in later? Absolutely not!

People will still copy it and distribute it - like SoRR. Again, the projects that *have* been C&amp;D'd very frequently were stupidly loudly announced. <br /><br />I want to again bring a reminder that SFxMM was a fangame made with Capcom's IP the whole time.

That's what happened with SoRR (which was mentioned later in the thread). Then again, the issue with SoRR is that it was better than the other three entries put together, and Sega was trying to rerelease SoR2 on iOS at the same time the final version of SoRR would have been out (if I recall correctly). Cue how well that went.
