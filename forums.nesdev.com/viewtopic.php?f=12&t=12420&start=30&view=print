Also as a reminder you are here on a Nintendo forum so it's not the best place to advocate the Megadrive (not that we have anything against that machine of course). <br /></div> <br /> <br />My message a bit overreacted but please avoid things like that : <br /> <br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> <br />I seriously think it's ridiculous how they talk about how high and mighty the Genesis is and that games like Gunstar Heroes would never be able to be on the SNES when games that are just as impressive, if not more so, can exist on the SNES like Space Megaforce or Rendering Ranger <br /><br />... <br />One think that's always amazed me is that no one has tried to make a port of Sonic the Hedgehog on the SNES... (It's easily doable.) <br /></div> <br /><br />For me that is just mis-informations... I often read the 65816 is able to compete with the 68000 and that's just matters of code optimization, well code optimization also exists for the 68000 and if you use very optimized code on the 68000 then you won't be able to reproduce it on 65816 whatever are your efforts. If you can do RR² with the stock 65816 then you will be able to push about twice as much with the 68000, that is as simple than that.<br />It's as true than the fact the Megadrive has only 4 palettes of 16 colors and whatever are your efforts you won't be able to display as colorful graphics then you can have on Snes.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'll just say that you're severely overstating what's going on in Gunstar Heroes. The physics are actually extremely simple, and every enemy is basically box collision + those simple physics + some really dumb AI. Do you seriously think that's impressive? =/ (and it's not like the fancy effects require that much processing either, they're more about being clever)</div><br /><br />And i think you are *really* under estimating it...<br />To be honest i don't like much the game but technically it's definitely an awesome achievement.<br />Just in first level, try to play it in hardest mode and see how much the screen is loaded... Nothing comes close to that on SNES, and i would say that even on NeoGeo you don't have much game with such intense action.<br />Dozen of ennemies, complexes explosions with particules physics, even your weapons can use advanced cinetics.<br />And that's in real game situation with a complexe sprite engine, collision code and so on, something different from a simple demo.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It was probably a bad idea to redraw sprites to compensate for the SNES's pixel aspect ratio.  I could probably whip up a usable sprite sheet for Gunstar Heroes, if I use the original sprites.  Lets see how fast I can do this.

The Neo Geo is definitely stronger, but the games are generally not as optimized. Also, did you even look at any of the videos I linked?<br /></div><br /><br />I do know the NeoGeo is stronger, almost same hardware as the Megadrive except it has a huge VDP and direct ROM access for graphics but that is not the point. I was just saying that GH is really heavy in term of what is happening of the screen.<br />And really i too much heard about SA and RR² but definitely these games, even if there are a great achievement for the SNES still has flaws showing the limit of the CPU. Both gamers suffers from being really static and &quot;unlife&quot;. All animations are far too much scripted, no physic, only rigid and fast movements, i would even bet that some of the movements are 100% integer computed in Super Aleste. I really dislike this game for that reason... too static and rigid. RR² has others flaws has very poor sprite animation...<br />I think even Gynoug which is almost a first generation Megadrive game push much further in term of animation than both of them, it is so smooth and feel much more alive :<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hy1xwyUAC0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hy1xwyUAC0</a><!-- m --><br /><br />But anyway honestly i don't want to fed a new SNES vs Megadrive debate, what matter for me it's correct technicals informations. This forum owns a lot of great and talented guys (the Bad Apple topic was very interesting and exciting to follow) but reading garbages as &quot;the SNES could do it easily !&quot; when that is definitely not the case is really boring.<br />The SNES can't compete against the Megadrive when it comes to CPU processing, that is the point. You can always do wonder with nice tricks but that exists for every systems.<br />Also now to answer to the topic, honestly i think that if tomorrow you do a nice SNES demo as the Bad Apple video (just need to be completed) then it would be promoted and covered by media as much as Megadrive demos.<br />At least i will promote it (i already promoted SNES demo on my twitter).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Meanwhile I'm thinking we should have an entire separate forum exclusively for arguing about which console is better, just so that people like Stef can pick their fights there and we can spend our time here focusing on how to actually get things done...<br /><br />We've had 20 years to fight about which one is superior.  If there still isn't a clear answer after all that then this kind of speculative forum bickering is certainly not going to sway me.

I know you have a lot of claims to make, but they'd be more persuasive with evidence.<br /><br /><strong>If you want to show technical superiority of a particular platform:</strong><br />Code equivalent demos or mini-games for each platform, provide source code, and show how one platform uses substantially more CPU time for an equivalent workload or what has to be left out to fit it all into video memory. Be prepared to see the other side take it as a friendly optimization challenge to improve the public's knowledge of efficient graphics engine design.<br /><br /><strong>If you want to use the lack of a port of a particular game as evidence:</strong><br />Not every licensed console game developer in the fourth generation had the budget to train its programmers in techniques that are effective on both platforms. Some were even under exclusive contract to a particular console maker. And most of us are unlikely to outlive the game's team by 70 years.<br /><br /><strong>If you want to discuss how to promote a demo to the public:</strong><br />Open a new topic for that in General Stuff. Make sure to stay on the topic of promotion, not bickering about technical superiority.<br /><br />Until then:<br /><br /><a href="http://carebears.wikia.com/wiki/Secret_Bear" class="postlink"><img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/carebears/images/5/5a/Secret_Bear.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120405173522" alt="Image" /><br />Talk to the belly badge.</a>
