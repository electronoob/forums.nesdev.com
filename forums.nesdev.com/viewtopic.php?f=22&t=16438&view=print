It helps the visual presentation having its own identity. <br /><br />The 1st boss fire attack seems more aimed at people who've played it/tested this game quite a lot. Switching to bare hands helped a bit with timing evasions, but i've yet not beat it. Maybe i'm just not good enough.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  Are there more bosses after this one?<br /><br /><br />EDIT: Ok, beat it at last! 36 minutes, including the pause to write the previous. I learned the timings using bare hands, then translated that into getting more careful/conservartive using the axe.<br /><br /><br />EDIT 2: I noticed you get to start with the axe on the second round!

(People who see NES stuff <em>often</em>.)<br /><br />There is a devlog: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://skullgirls.com/forums/index.php?threads/indivisible-on-nes-playable-rom-inside-image-heavy.8488/">http://skullgirls.com/forums/index.php? ... eavy.8488/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />My favorite post is <a href="http://skullgirls.com/forums/index.php?threads/indivisible-on-nes-playable-rom-inside-image-heavy.8488/page-2#post-376775" class="postlink">this one about button input.</a><br /><br />I totally regret not posting updates in more places once I realized I was in it for the long haul.<br /><br />rainwarrior: You're the first person to publicly post a time (that I know about)! <br /><br />Rahsennor: There's so much more to write about! In theory. I have post drafts and over 300 gifs recorded over the course of development. Most didn't make it to that thread. Here's one gem: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/OR4FFqD.gif" class="postlink">God Mode (Light Spoilers, don't click until you've played!)</a> (You can't actually unlock this, it's just a silly thing I did during development because it was easy.)<br /><br />But there's some things I need to take care of before I really can write much more. Just getting this done was a struggle with current going-ons.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I very much like that you went with large meta-sprites despite the per scanline limit. It helps the visual presentation having its own identity.</div><br />Thanks! This game even handles &gt;64 sprites, but there's only one way to <em>really</em> see that happen and it ain't the vines.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /> I sort of regret the graphical style, but that's a thing I'll probably write a whole giant post on.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Switching to bare hands helped a bit with timing evasions, but i've yet not beat it.</div><br />Other people, definitely don't use barehands because then that fight takes like twice as long. (Axe does more damage). Glad you beat it, though! <br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Are there more bosses after this one?</div><br />&quot;Just like the original game.&quot; is probably the best answer to that question.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">EDIT 2: I noticed you get to start with the axe on the second round!</div><br />Yep. And if you beat it again that way you'll get different clear text showing it.<br /><br />I obviously didn't do the battle system, but this game took some pretty great pains to be close to the original in most other ways.

I happened to play the Indivisible prototype on PS4 not a long ago, so it was fun to compare the two.<br /><br />(One minor difference I noticed was that if you die in the boss, the boss music keeps playing. I think having silence or some mellow music (as in the original) before the boss appears would be better.)
