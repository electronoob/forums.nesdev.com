Woot <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I left NES development after burning myself out trying to learn the hardware side of things, and getting burned on a bad chip programmer. After INL started working on the NESDEV1 I felt like the thing I had been championing was in good hands.<br /><br />While I was gone I developed a roguelike for Android devices, but scrapped the project half-way through because <em>gaming on a touch screen sucks</em>. Then I played World of Warcraft for about a month until all challenge in the game was gone, then did the same for Diablo 3 <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />In the past three months I've wanted to come back to the scene but was embarrassed to. I started working on DOS programming, but it just wasn't the same. So I finally swallowed my pride and came back.<br /><br />Thanks for the warm welcome <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

It turned out that the real problem is ability to feel where your thumb is relative to the touchable area. The Control Pad of the Turbo Touch has raised edges. So until phones gain the ability to display Braille, ports of gamepad games to touch screen devices will continue to suck. On the other hand, there are the Xperia Play, the JXD S5100, and the forthcoming Archos GamePad, which are Android devices that include physical buttons for game control. There is also a free <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ccpcreations.android.WiiUseAndroid&amp;hl=en" class="postlink">application</a> to use a Wii Remote or a Classic Controller as a Bluetooth keyboard on an Android device with Bluetooth (i.e. anything recent that's not a Kindle Fire).<br /><br />I wrote an article about <a href="http://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=Touch_typing" class="postlink">how a flat touch screen affects various use cases</a>. The gist is that gaming doesn't work for the same reason that touch typing doesn't work.

It's true it's made by Sony, and so there's only an official PlayStation emulator. But homebrew devs have made emulators for pretty much everything else.<br /><br />PSP is not just a portable PlayStation. It's its own console and leagues more powerful.
