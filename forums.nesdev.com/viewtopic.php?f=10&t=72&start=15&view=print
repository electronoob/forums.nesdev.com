MMC5 doesn't support this at all, as far I know. ExGrafix mode was created in compensation of this.</div><br /><br />Well, it's not like the MMC5 doesn't have the common background bankswitching theme that most other mappers have. You just have to wire up an 256KB SRAM chip and rewire it to match the pinout. You might then need to chir cart edge line CHR R/W between the MMC5 and the SRAM chips R/W.<br /><br />You then (at the beginning of VBLANK), turn of ExGrafix mode and put in the CHR bankswitching sceme and switch to the bank who's RAM you want to write too. And then right to the bankswitched area that you assigned (some place in the PPUs $0000-$1FFF area). I believe it would be as simple as that as the MMC5 would change the SRAMs Address lines (depending on what's accessed and the CHR bankswitching theme set) as you write or read to the CHR-RAM. I 'm not completely sure of that however as I've never done aything like that before. I believe the VRC7 was able to do something like that, but I believe it only had 8KB (maybe it had 16KB ram?) CHR-RAM that was bankswitched in 1K banks (since I believe it was also designed for CHR-ROM so bankswitching was already inntegrated into the mapper and when they used CHR-RAM they decided they could use that capability even though it was RAM.<br /><br />I'm not sure what you'd actually write too if ExGrafix mode was setup (maybe the first 8KBs of the chip?), but with the regular CHR bankswitching on, I'm sure it would treat it as any other PPU access and switch the CHR-RAMs data lines accordingly to where your write are.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hmmmm, <br />If you want choose between Chr-Rom and Chr-Ram, you should already choose your mapper. Only a few mappers supports both of them (MMC1, MMC3, and I don't know if there is any other). CNROM, MMC2, MMC4 and MMC5 supports only Chr-Rom, and UNROM, ANROM suports only Chr-Ram.<br /></div><br /><br />I don't see how a RAM chip and a ROM chip would act any different in an NES's eyes. I believe any mapper could support either CHR-ROM or CHR-RAM as long as you wire it up correctly. Most of the discrete logic chip mappers had CHR-RAM because that was the most beneficial (it could be stored in PRG-ROM, which was bankswitched, that way you could have a lot of CHR-data and PRG-data, just look at Lagrange Point). MMC1 "supports" both because it's beneficial to have either one since both chips may be bankswitched. The MMC3 "supports" both because it's beneficial either way.<br /><br />Think about it, UNROM could very well have a CHR-ROM chip, but having a whole mess of PRG-code and only 8KBs of CHR-ROM would not be very good, thus no games ever did that (they used something like CNROM instead).<br /><br />It's all a matter of the developers needs, some could use CHR-RAM or CHR-ROM with an MMC3 and produce great games because the MMC3 could compensate for each, but (although possible) you couldn't produce *great* games using CHR-ROM with UNROM (unless you wanted to do something like take Super Mario and add a whole mess more levels and music or something like that).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">PS : I looked at the Brian povancio's site about his project, Grand Theftendo. He said he's using MMC5 mapper and he also spoke about a tool to compress his graphics. So, that's impossible.</div><br /><br />Did you mean "So, it's possible"? Brian could have easily been talking about the nametable data or something because I believe he wants the game to work an emulators and with the iNES format I don't believe you can have more than 8KBs of RAM (unless he sets up a new mapper number and somehow makes emu authors recognize it and add it). His game looks really good though <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The NES PPU does not read background and sprite data at the same time; instead, it reads background data during draw and sprite data during hblank. The MMC5 appears to count nametable accesses (of which there are always 34 on a scanline). <br /></div><br /><br />Ahh, yes your right, thx. I wasn't sure exactly how/when sprites were fetched so thx that explains it for me <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">CPROM, the Videomation mapper, does nearly the same thing. <br /></div><br /><br />Hmmm, I can't find any info on that mapper. Does it have more that 8KBs of RAM bankswitched or something. How exactly does it work? Could you show me where to find some info on it, it seems pretty interesting. thx <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Better would be to make a custom mapper that uses a really fast SRAM to map VRAM simultaneously into $6000-$7FFF and into PPU space.<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Yeah, your right, but I was just thinking about what is currently available and such as I doubt any new NES mappers will ever be made (aside from Memblers Squeedo). It was just an idea and it would be much more practicle to incorporate it into a mapper of some sort (could actually make some pretty interesting games like that hmmm <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
