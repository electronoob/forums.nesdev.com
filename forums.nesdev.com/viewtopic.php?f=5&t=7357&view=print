		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I know quite a few people here have retro-gaming projects not related to the NES, and since I recently acquired an old arcade cabinet, I figured I would ask if anyone else has an arcade project. Below is a little info on my current project, and a few pictures can be see at <a href="http://img697.imageshack.us/g/img20101228221144.jpg/" class="postlink">http://img697.imageshack.us/g/img20101228221144.jpg/</a> , hopefully i will be able to add more pictures soon. 
<br />
<br />I recently bought an 1981 Williams Stargate cabinet from a guy here in town. He had bought it a few months prior and had the monitor go out on him. After taking the machine home, i started digging in to the system. The first thing I found was that the isolation transformer had been bypassed going to the monitor and that the power cord to the machine itself was not only missing the ground pin, but was also two power cords spliced together without the ground wires even connected (I did not notice this previously as it has been bundled up) so I replaced the power cord with a nice heavy duty one (it even has a ground pin!) and fixed the wiring for the isolation/power distribution area. Next, I noticed that one of the previous owners had messed with the wiring to the coin door... to get free play. I dont know why they did not just put the system in to free play mode. I was able to get all coin door wiring straightened out with the exception of the memory protect switch.... which they had mangled for some reason and now is always open. I plan on using a SPST switch as a temp fix until i can get a new switch. 
<br />
<br />At this point, I started troubleshooting the monitor chassis board. I started by checking that both fuses were still good, and then proceeded to make sure power was getting up to the monitor. everything checked out so far. after a bit of probing, i discovered that the rectifier diodes were out so I proceeded to discharge the flyback (yay for old Heathkit probes!) and replace the diodes. I looked over the board a bit, everything looked to be in fairly good condition with the exception of being a bit dusty, so I blew off what dust I could and put the board back on the monitor chassis. I kicked on the machine without the monitor power hooked up and watched the diagnostic display on the ROM board, everything checked out and I heard the startup sounds for stargate. I then turned the machine off, hooked up power to the monitor, and kicked the machine on.... the monitor kicked on. "YAY!!!!!.... oh crap... the flyback is arcing...." At this point I decided I might as well replace the flyback, h-out transistor, regulator transistor, and get a cap kit so that I should not have to tear in to the monitor again later on. 
<br />
<br />While waiting for the monitor chassis parts, I started disassembling various parts of the cabinet and cleaning it as well as I can. I have found a few other strange things... such as the two speaker wires being cut and twisted back together without any sort of electric tape or what not... this has since been repaired and the wires are not soldered directly to the speaker. 
<br />
<br />current plans for the machine:
<br />* rebuild monitor chassis once parts come in
<br />* replace coin door and coin box locks
<br />* get correct color leaf switch buttons for control panel
<br />* have local print shop print off new decal for control panel and screen bezel (screen bezel is scratched up and control panel has black contact paper currently)
<br />* replace coin return button and return arm for player 2 coin assembly
<br />
<br />Possible plans:
<br />* create duplicate cabinet and transfer components in to new cabinet... getting new side decals (old cabinet is quite beat up)
<br />* Modify system to play Joust or Stargate

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />We have  a Defender cab, with a modified control panel with the Inviso button and a stargate boardset to play that, too. My dad just finished up his mod to play All the williams classics on one boardset with a couple new boards and a switch, he's building it soon. It played Defender on a Stargate set 100% perfectly and will work with everything else. No sinistar though, thats a different monitor and extra board so no sense in doing that. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Nice cab. Great game, I was 7th in the world on Defender for XBLA before the arcade thing came, never got points so I never got the game there. I doubt my score transferred over. :/
<br />
<br />
<br />Have fun though! Our cabinet is beat to HELL and back, but Williams games are amazing, nomatter what the cabinet is like. When you get this thing running like a champ again it'll be a BLAST. Williams arcade games are amazing. I'd love to develop on a Williams arcade game, but my dad hasn't supplied me with a board set or time to develop on it. Has has all the registers mapped out, listed, what they do, etc. But has never wrote anything on it! The only thing I really know is the games first instruction is CLR D000. Reset the bankswitching. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />
<br />This is the best decision of your life. Sounds like the game needs alot of repair, but it's worth the time. Your never going to regret it! Keep us updated, the cab isn't that bad from the pics.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have 3 arcade cabinets, another hobby I jumped into about a year ago (it was inevitable).
<br />
<br />First one was originally Boot Camp by Konami (dual trackballs, with a lower shelf for more buttons).  But at some point was converted to Street Fighter 2 CE.  Cabinet was painted grey, you can still see the outline of the original artwork though.  I replaced the board with my old PC, using a Jamma adapter, replaced the joysticks and buttons with all new stuff, cleaned the coin mechs, fixed the marquee light (needed a new starter), added a subwoofer (also drives the 2 original speakers), then I wired a volume pot in-line with that and mounted it onto the front of the cabinet, using a pre-existing but convenient hole (easy to reach, but hard to bump into accidentally).  Pretty decent cabinet, 2 players, 6 buttons each, and on the lower metal control panel 'shelf' if I wanted to, I could install up to 8 (!) more buttons.  Monitor needs a cap kit, haven't done it yet.
<br />
<br />The second one really is a project (still on-going).  It was also a Konami cabinet, a 4-player one that I think was Sunset Riders originally (just guessing from the colors on a tiny piece of the art that remains).  It had been converted to Police Trainer, and the person I got it from (was just an empty cabinet) was converting it to NFL Blitz but quit part-way through it, after sanding the top of the (huge) control panel.  I had planned to sand it all, prime it, paint it, but I later said screw that, and will just sand and prime the parts that need it, then paint over it all.  But it's still sitting at my dad's house, as there's no way I can paint it here (without hauling it up and down stairs repeatedly).  Too cold to mess with it now, not enough daylight either (thanks to Indiana moving onto the retarded "daylight saving time" so now it's always dark when I get home from work).  But I picked up an old 25" monitor for that one, haven't even fired it up yet.  I bought a TMNT marquee to put on it, heheh.  Not sure what I'll do for the control panel artwork yet, definitely something polycarbonate though because it cleans up so easily.
<br />
<br />The 3rd cabinet, no big surprise, is a Playchoice-10 (single monitor version).  Decent shape, has 10 games.  Monitor also needs a cap kit, picture is noticeably shrunken vertically.  I also have a VS Dualsystem board that I might use with this eventually.  Other than the cap kit, the main other plan I have for this is to wire a zapper to it.  The arcade light guns sell for more than I want to pay.
<br />
<br />Later on I still want to look for more cheap cabinets!  Good thing I have a big basement.
<br />
<br />A friend's stepdad used to have Defender, I played the hell out of it over there and really grew to like it.  On my SF2 cabinet I play Robotron more than anything else.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><strong>3gengames</strong>: 
<br />I have been toying with the idea of development on the "classic" williams systems as well, on breaks at work I have been messing with the idea of writing a disassembler that should allow me to disassemble Stargate a bit easier. Between the schematics for the boards and a disassembly... i should be good to go. Have you seen <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.seanriddle.com/willy.html">http://www.seanriddle.com/willy.html</a><!-- m --> ? I stumbled upon it last night and it seem to have some good stuff on it. sadly the data files he used with a disassembler are missing... but oh wells. As far as the cabinet damage to my Stargate, besides being beat up with various scratches and what not, the lower front section of the cabinet that the coin door and coin box are mounted to have split down the center... i suppose i could just replace that section but I figure it would be funner to make a new cabinet.
<br />
<br /><strong>Memblers</strong>:
<br />Sounds like you have quite the collection starting up, happen to have any pictures? I am rather jealous that you have a playchoice 10. I almost bought one from a local tattoo shop a few years back but was unable to. There is a pizza place a few hours from where I live that has a broken VS Super Mario Bros cabinet, I have been wanting to snag that one for a while though they sadly dont want to sell it. I had been wanting to get an arcade cabinet for quite a while and came really close to getting a Shinobi convert, but the seller bailed on our deal at the last minute.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You have to pick your hardware though. I'd go for Defender's hardware, it has bankswitching. Stargate doesn't have bankswitching. And then there's the special chips for moving memory or not, you can homebrew on that too. One good thing is that sound is on a seperate board and all you do is send codes to it and it plays it. Bad thing is unless your good, it's only one channel, since it's a 8-Bit DAC.
<br />
<br />
<br />And one BAD thing about this is that the RAM thats use able is scattered throughout it. It has X bytes on screen, X bytes in HBLANK, X bytes on screen, X Bytes in HBLANK so you have to calculate what's useable and what's not. Then you'll probably have to do what they did with defender and put the stack on the left side of the screen and adjust it off.
<br />
<br />
<br />If you homebrew, just use a good 6809 assembler and then a 6800 for the sound board. That should make you good for a while. 6809 is very fun to code although this platform might be difficult, it'll be a cool adventure. If you do this you should keep me posted. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />When I say it's in good shape, I mean for it's age, heheh.  Coin counter on the PC10 is 21,487 (and still counts).  Counter counter on Boot Camp/SF2 CE is 114,697 and looks like it hasn't been hooked up for a while.  That's a lot of quarters.
<br />
<br />Notice on the SF2 when I replaced the joysticks I got the colors backwards from the "traditional" 1P blue 2P red that lots of stuff used.  Oh well, I haven't yet cleaned the rust out of it either.
<br />
<br />The project cab just looks like junk under a tarp for now.  There were huge holes (from the Police Trainer guns) all over the front that I filled in with bondo, sanded it down, I want to paint it next spring.
<br />
<br />Yeah the PC10 cabinet was just luck, Xious here on the forums mentioned it and it was reasonably close to me.  Before that I got the VS board as a gift, I thought I was gonna get a Nintendo-Jamma adapter but ended up with a real Nintendo cabinet, heh.
<br />
<br />Picking up that 4-player Konami cabinet was the tragedy of a lifetime though.  The guy also had a VS DualSystem cabinet (mostly gutted, but still..) and was happy to give it to me.  But I had nowhere I could put it, there's no way it could fit into my home.  Maybe he still has it, he had other good stuff for cheap too, if you're around central Ohio (I'm not, but was passing through the area pretty often).

<br />Does the sound board have a timer or some other cycle-counting assistance that would aid in writing a soft mixer?
<br />
<br />Of course we could just cop out and code for Vs. or PlayChoice.

Yesterday was one of those fun days where i was rather grumpy so I decided to sit down, relax, and redo the chassis board. everything went smooth with the exception of running out of soldering braid (while being unable to get more because my son was sleeping) and that the new flyback's pins were all pointing slightly inward.... made it hard to put the new ones in

<br />The end result, still need to do some adjustments. the stargate machine lives!

I have current spent $137 and everything is technically working with the exception of a few small things. (the second coin slot is missing one of the levers and the memory protect and bookkeeping switches need to be replaced).

<br />If I had the room, it would be sweet to have a nice cabinet with a big monitor. But it works out this way being able to use the same RGB monitor for arcade games as I do my retro consoles like PCE, Genesis, SNES, etc.
