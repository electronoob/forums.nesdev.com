		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was going to ask Kev but as he isn't around atm I thought someone on here might know. Anyway I just finished building my copynes kit but I have this strange problem.
<br />
<br />When the copynes board is attached the game in the system will only run about once every eight times of powering up or resetting, and then it usually crashes. This isn't a connector or game problem because once I unplug the copynes board and plug the cpu in to the NES direct it loads the game every time no problem.
<br />
<br />I thought it was probable a bad connection from the cpu socked on the copynes board to the connector underneath that connects to the cpu socket on the NES. But I have re-soldered every joint on the copynes board and also tested the connections with a multi meter and all appears to be fine. 
<br />
<br />Does anyone have any ideas? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" />

<br />
<br />What do you mean by reset?  Does it reset during a dump or when you playing a cart in CopyNES?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It defiantly isn't the cartridge, I've tried a few and all work first time without the copynes board. It doesn't reset, I meant if it works (the one in eight or so times of turning it on) and I press reset it will stop working. 
<br />
<br />Meaning if I try and dump anything it will fail every time because the software requires a reset.
<br />
<br />I seem to have the same problem mentioned here <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=695&amp;">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=695&amp;</a><!-- m --> but I have already changed the cap near the lock-out chip so it doesn't really help solve the problem.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That does sound like the problem I was having, but mine turned out to be a software bug. If you have an eprom programmer you could try re-burning the ROM, but that's not likely to be the issue.
<br />
<br />Only think I could suggest is get a meter with continuity and check everything for proper connections/shorts. (but you already did that...)
<br />
<br />Does it work evertime with the parallel port disconnected? (edit: I guess not.)
<br />
<br />Edit: Try removing the cable for the || port from the CopyNES Board.

<br />
<br />Look for an 8k .bin file. I think Kev updates it now and then and any differences may not necessarily mean there is a problem.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks, I am pretty much convinced it is a problem with the eprom software. Although it sounds like a hardware fault once I get a game running I can shack the NES up and down and side to side without it crashing.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> 
<br />
<br />Also flexing the copynes pcb and pushing down on the chips while it's on doesn't cause it to crash either.
<br />
<br />Either that or it's to do with the cap near the lock-out chip mentioned in the other thread but 1uf still not giving it enough of a delay?.
<br />
<br />I have tried an NTSC NES and a PAL one with the same results.

<br />
<br />For example, check the voltage on the 74 157 and check that the address lines from the CPU to the NES board are enable/disabled at the approriate times, or check the port bits in the 6522 and make sure the proper values are set..etc. This is basically how I found/fixed my problem.
