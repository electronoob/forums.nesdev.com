The dead bodies and gore can be rendered to a static background layer like in Lemmings.<br /><br />I noticed the &quot;cheep&quot; but thought it was a brand. It happens to be the sound that a baby bird makes, or the name of a &quot;flying&quot; fish from Super Mario Bros. series. There's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN5Wa8IqIdo" class="postlink">commercial airing on U.S. television</a> with various ad posters showing baby chicks as the mascot of a company offering &quot;cheep&quot; auto insurance. The ironic thing about it is that the name of the fictional insurer with the &quot;Cheep&quot; mascot is &quot;Car-Tuned&quot;, yet the commercial is for Esurance, an insurer that itself used to have a cartoon mascot named Erin.

English is a shitty language in general -- really, it is -- but that's really not an excuse.  Of course I still to this day cannot explain to folks exactly when to use affect vs. effect because there are some edge cases which make a mess of it.  On the other hand, at least it's not Swedish, where some of the rules pertaining to grammar and spelling can't be explained -- you just have to remember lots of one-offs.  (Ex: I can't tell you how many times I have to ask someone &quot;is that word pronounced with a hard sk, or a wh?&quot;)<br /><br />And tepples, stop being weird.  :P~

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It took me a while before I saw what was wrong in that picture. I guess I am already used to misspelling on the Internet/in games which often happens on purpose.<br />Is it a problem? Maybe.<br /><br />I always considered English to be an easy-to-use language which somehow manages to still be understandable.<br />German grammar has some major problems!<br />Here is an example:<br />The German language has articles of different genders for nouns. So instead of &quot;a&quot; as an undefined article and &quot;the&quot; as a defined article there is &quot;ein,eine,ein&quot; (yes, the first and the last are totally different...) and &quot;der,die,das&quot;.<br />The first one is the male article, the second the female and the third a neutral one.<br />So far everything seems to be alright. It gets confusing now: They change for plural nouns. The first three cannot be used anymore, because they only describe one, undefined noun. The latter three change to &quot;die,die,die&quot;. And yes, I did not just make a mistake!<br /><br />Also to get back to the gender-specific articles which as you noticed only exist for singular nouns.<br />They are not used in a way that makes sense.<br />An example:<br />die Frau (the woman)<br />das Mädchen (the girl)<br /><br />What German grammar has shown us here is that girls apparently have no gender.<br /><br />And there is more where that came from. And I have not even talked about our ways to overcomplicate sentences and anglicism in the German language.<br />You will have a hard time trying to find a German person who still says &quot;Ich habe etwas heruntergeladen&quot; instead of &quot;Ich habe etwas gedownloadet&quot;. (I'm &quot;guilty&quot; of that myself at times)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Going on the languages thing, I also believe English isn't bad at all. I took 2 Spanish classes. I really enjoyed it. But when you get in to learning all the tenses for verbs and switching endings and everything, English really got it right compared to Spanish. (Spanish half got it right, has Haber is used with a set ending to say a lot of verb forms.) Along with not having indirect object pronouns that can switch places. Man, I wish I could have taken more Spanish. It was difficult but I really did enjoy it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Gramatically, English is pretty easy and flexible compared to other languages. Adjectives have no gender, verb conjugation is fairly simple... It's the pronunciation that sucks: there's a complete lack of consistency between written and spoken words. You can never know how a word is pronounced until you have heard someone saying it. Take the absurdity that is laughter vs. slaughter... you put an innocent &quot;s&quot; in front of the word and it changes completely.<br /><br />EDIT: Removed something that I actually wanted to post in another thread! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />
