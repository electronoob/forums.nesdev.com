<br />This guy has modded an NES Toaster to output not only S-video, but also friggin' component video!
<br />
<br />He does it by using a Play-Choice 10 PPU and then built a converter board. This is something I very much want to buy.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately the dude hasn't responded to my messages and his page seems rather dead.
<br />
<br />I know I'm new still here, but still, does anyone here have the technical skill to build such a system? What would be the overall cost of such a project? I'm guessing this would be rather pricey.
<br />
<br />He doesn't mention it in his video, but what would be the quality/resolution of NES games in component? Even at 480p, that's still rather incredible.
<br />
<br />Anyway, let me know what you guys think.

<br />"Component video" can still be 240p or 480i, as seen when playing PS1 games on a PS2 + component cable, or when playing GameCube or VC games on a Wii + component cable.

While it would look pretty sharp on an old analog tube that takes Component Video or S-Video, it's a waste on a digital TV. They don't cope well with 240 line low resolution computer graphics. 
<br />
<br />Really on a good CRT, the NES composite video looks pretty good. It's not going to look as razor sharp as an emulator, but it never was meant to be.

<br />
<br />Would games look better on a Famicom Titler or on this modded NES? IIRC, the Titler outputs RGB, and does so through S-Video? 
<br />
<br />So it would be S-video true RGB vs component converted from RGB. Which would give a better signal?

<br />
<br />S-Video from a Titler is encoded using an RGB encoder.
<br />
<br />RGB in this guy's mod is simultaneously transcoded to component and encoded to S-Video. Component is better quality than S-Video so yes, the same will hold true here. You will however get wrong colors inherent in the RGB PPU's palette in exchange for encoding artifacts.
<br />
<br />He probably used one of the mod boards promoted at Neo-Geo.com, over there they are video mod fanatics.
<br />
<br />The resolution is the same if you're using RF or RGB.. Analog filtering from non-ideal components may cause some loss in perceived horizontal resolution however.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />dewmansnk does great work, actually. He worked on my NES deck as well, though it has more features than the one shown there:
<br />
<br />(1) RGB mod into amp, into JROK encoder with RGB passthrough, component, svideo, and composite.
<br />(2) Stereo Audio
<br />(3) Powerpak mod
<br />(4) Resistor mod for powerpak audio
<br />
<br />RGB is wired to a Genesis 1 A/V connector, so standard off the shelf SCART cables work with it fine. Component/Svideo/composite just have standard jacks, and Stereo has 2 RCA jacks.
<br />
<br />The picture quality from RGB is equal to a Sharp Titler's, component is fairly close, Svideo a more distant third. Powerpak compatibility and the resistor mod on the EXP connector make it capable of FDS/translated ROMs/Unreleased and Beta ROMs, etc.. all it really needs now is a 15 pin Fami port to handle everything.

<br />
<br />Does the Famicom Titler not have the proper home console Palette? I don't recall any definite answer to if its RGB PPU had the same issues as the arcade RGB PPUs in reguards to mismatched colors with home systems.

<br />Does anybody have any idea where you can get a panel/chassis mount s-video connector like the one shown here? All the chassis mount s-video connectors with solder terminals on the back I can find are ugly. Mounted with screws and whatnot. I would love to get my hands on some of these.

<br />
<br />I actually really like the different pallet. Only instance in where it was bizarre was in Super Mario Bros 2 (USA), the snow world (world 4) was purple instead of blue. But if you look on the back of the box for the game, it shows up purple so meh!
