<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.tapplastics.com" class="postlink">Tap Plastics</a> has a good website of products and good stores if you are in Calif.  First you need the mold materials, most likely <a href="http://www.tapplastics.com/shop/product.php?pid=61&amp;" class="postlink">silicone rtv</a> (room temp curing) parts A and B.  Then you need the <a href="http://www.tapplastics.com/shop/product.php?pid=75&amp;" class="postlink">clear resin</a> and the <a href="http://www.tapplastics.com/shop/product.php?pid=40&amp;" class="postlink">hardener</a>.  Total cost of $40-50.  Shouldnt need any additives or thinners for the nes cart.  Should also have at least accurate measuring cups and preferably an accurate scale like a postal one.  Using exact measurements and recording each attempt makes it go faster.  Each page has a link to instructions on using the product.  Of course most of the stuff is probably toxic so do it outside if the weather isnt cold or find somewhere ventilated.
<br />
<br />Maybe next month I will have some free time to try doing it all again.  I still have shirts with big blue spots from pouring the mold...

<br />I'd suggest vacuum forming, but that'd offer no internal supports for mounting a pcb or even screw posts for closing the case.

<br />I hope Dragon Skill will heheh. In all objectivity I think no current homebrew games are worth it up now (but mybe that will change until soon), but your power pack is seriously worth it. I bet a lot of non-dev people would love getting a such system, and nesdev people will even more.
<br />Until now I've just planned to release the ROM of my games with instructions on how to modify actual carts for harware guys. Now I'm more and more seriously thinking to release the ROM, the instruction for modify actual carts, and to put some carts with homemade ciruit in them to sell. I've no experience selling however, and I must complete a game anyway. However, it would be great to sell copies of the game soon after its online release. So people can try it under emulation, and just play it only in emulation if they don't bother. Hardware guys would be able to modify their own cartridges without paying too much (only the price of their material). And the people who have no hardware knownledge nor material and that bother less paying than playing under emultion could just buy actual carts. I don't know how well it'd sell. I think I'd get problems it if would sell too well, getting not enough componant and cartridge cases, and getting too much old games' PCB without knowing what to do with them. Also, I don't know how I'd make labels and/or boxes. I think I can made labels with paper and paper glue (already made that), but they can be scratched easily, and reveal the old label.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Were I to get into this I'd go more along the lines of the early-90s shareware model, putting a demo ROM (but a full-featured demo that actually gives you an idea of what the game's like) on the Internet and selling the complete game in cartridge-only form, and include a notice with the cart that explains why pirating such a game is not cool (as opposed to ROM dumping of out-of-production games) and asking buyers to not distribute any ROMs they dump. But that's just me; you could certainly put the whole thing up for download, and if it's good I'm sure lots of people would want a copy on a cartridge. (The fact that I played Final Fantasy on an emulator first but still shelled out $20 for the cartridge testifies to this.)
<br />
<br />As for label printing, there's special label paper available for standard printers; it's thicker than normal printer paper and adhesive-backed, typically used for mass printing of address labels. The stuff I've seen doesn't come with the nice shiny finish of real cart labels, but I have seen printer paper with such a finish, so I wouldn't be too surprised to find it in adhesive-backed form if you know where to look. Boxes can also be done in a printer on lightweight cardboard (although you'd have much better luck with a laser than with an inkjet, simply because feeding cardboard through a printer that bends the page would be an iffy thing) and assembled by hand with a little creative folding.
<br />
<br />In short, with the revelation of the resin-casting thing, I'd say that all the tools to make a homebrew NES cart into a low-budget small business exist, if you have the time to devote to it.

<br />Yeah, I prefer by far doing this. I don't want to be bastard like N. since people will be able to download it anyway it's just better to do it officially.
<br />And yeah, I've just played FF under an emulator because it won't work with any PAL NES anyway. However, playing old games under emultion largely increase the sales of their sequels on recent platforms, at least it did for me.
<br />I wouldn't have bought any Fire Emblem for GBA without touching the series fist on NES emulation, for example.

<br />FF won't work on a PAL NES? That's a surprise; I never thought of it as high-performance enough to be affected by PAL/NTSC differences.

<br />I seem to remember an "orb effect" in one of the FF games that relied on cycle timing to turn the mono bit on and off

<br />It's very simple actually. The game writes the textbox in the second nametable and switch it manually trough $2000 midframe with timing code. It would be easy to hack the game to run proplrely in PAL and write it on a custom modified cart (I've done that with FF2, wich was even simpler since the textboxes are normal so I just had to hack the effect for screen fading to time correctly on PAL). However, a commercial FF1 cart would work badly. Also, message speed only change how long the message are shown, so even higher message speed will keep very long animation and just show the text for so few time you won't have time to read. It's a bit annoying sometimes, fortunately this was fixed in FF3 and higher. However, my custom FF2 carts need serious patience to be played on real hardware because battle animation is slow ! After a dozen of minutes this gets incredibly depressing.

<br />If you mean rounded corners, I think you get a punch for that. The simple, cheap way I can see to do that is to take sheet aluminum, bend it to fit the shape of your label in a cookie-cutter sort of way, and file the edges sharp. But I'm sure there's a company out there that will make such a punch for you.
