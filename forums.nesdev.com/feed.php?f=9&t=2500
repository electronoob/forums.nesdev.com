A Russian guy by the name of CaH4e3 has dumped many many Sachen games among others, and also has some tech info about them as well. He has ROMs on his page so I can't link it here, but just search for the name and you will find it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=158">BootGod</a> — Sun Nov 12, 2006 1:15 pm</p><hr />

Quick question: How do you know that these games are undumped? I know there are quite a few Sachen multicarts that have already been dumped, but I'm not sure if these are the same.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=790">85cocoa</a> — Thu Nov 09, 2006 1:13 am</p><hr />

I have a bunch of famicom sachen multi's and have been having fun taking them apart tonight.<br /><br />Most have eproms for the chr and the prg and the mapper is always a glop top.  Some have prg glop tops--but they're always on a little glop top to dip 32 converter...  Then a few have all glop tops.<br /><br />It doesn't seem to matter how many games are on the multies, they mostly use the same circuit board (marked tc-30-3).  Most of the different boards seem to be versions of the same  (found ones marked marked tc-30 and tc-30-2 so far--tc-30 is also marked SAV1212 and looks different than the other two).  Poker III is the only one not marked tc-30 and has sa-630.<br /><br />Did sachen use more than one multi mapper or are they all the same mapper?<br /><br />The few individule sachen roms availiable all seem to have different mappers according to their ines header.  Do they really use different mappers?  Some of those individule games are on some of these multis.  Jovial race is on one of these multi's so I don't think they can all be little nrom games.  Jovial race also seems to have it's very own mapper according to the mapper list.<br /><br />Is it worth my effort to try and dump some of these?  <br /><br />I know that there may not be answers out there, but I'm just kinda curious since I started opening these up...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=231">sevast</a> — Sun Nov 05, 2006 3:39 am</p><hr />
