		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Personally I have no major opinion on the timing of Qt5 integration, but I can give more information that may influence yours: Right now, to support JSON objects gracefully, I had to add an additional git submodule to the project to link in another JSON repo, and use the functionality that that provides. However, Qt5 provides a JSON system as well, that was absent from Qt4. If Qt5 is integrated before I prep a PR for the vscode work, I have no issue with supporting Qt5’s objects beforehand. If Qt5 is integrated after I prep a PR, then some work should be done after-the-fact to deprecate and remove the external JSON functionality I’m roping in. Aside from that it doesn’t affect me, really.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's a good point, and there isn't ever going to be a non-Qt5-based release that includes the new debugger GUI, so I'd probably consider working from (or merging) the qt5 branch if possible and working from there if possible.<br /><br />(Also, if you're planning a pull request, please be aware that I'm not planning to merge benny's entire fork all at once at any point, and there will likely be commits from that fork which end up being omitted entirely, depending on how I feel about certain changes/features, so you'll probably end up needing to rebase your changes at some point in the future)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, when I say &quot;Based on&quot; I mostly mean &quot;I copied everything in <a href="https://github.com/CypherSignal/bsnes-plus/commit/3d0024d7c28de89b7a1e18f5e5512842f410ed1e" class="postlink">disassembler/symbols</a> and cleaned out some stuff that may not make sense in the immediate term but can be recuperated later&quot; (e.g. breakpoints specified in the symbol files themselves, being able to write out new symbol files from the emulator). I'm not operating on the full fork or anything. There will be some collision of code, but it should not be too significant because most of the changes in that vein should be shared. Later on, when a PR is actually filed and let's say you haven't integrated any of benny's work, I can do a check to see how bad a resolve looks like if, say, all of that stuff had to come in - since that would be some work that you have to do ultimately - but that can be handled at the time, if that scenario comes to pass. Otherwise, if it comes to it that you integrate his work, I'm fine handling the resolves myself.
