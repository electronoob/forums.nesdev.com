Oh dear me, I started the thread and didn't even take the time to say what I had to say 'case I was too busy.<br />So my theory so far was in the likes of the following :<br /><br />3d operations consists of translation among 3 axises and rotation among 3 axises. 3d graphics consists of games having 2d action in a 3d environment, or a 3d action in a 2d environment, or both (3d action in a 3d environment), but the later is less suited for fake-3d style graphics obviously.<br /><br />Translation among the X and Y axises are trivial to fake on 2D hardware because it's simply scrolling<br />Translation among Z axis is equivalent to scaling, only supported by some hardware (mode 7, GBA sprites), and is also easy to pre-render (or even real-time render like a demo by tepples)<br /><br />Rotation among X and Y axis is very difficult to fake, yet it seems High Hopes managed to do so for the X axis only using some trick so it's possible<br />Rotation among the Z axis is equivalent to 2D rotation, this is supported by some hardware (mode 7, GBA sprites) and is also easy to pre-render<br /><br />Now it's possible to combine pre-rendering with other real-time technique to get a 3d feel. Having isometric-graphic is a particular case of pre-rendering that allows for higher re-utilisation of backgrounds, making it possible to semi-pre-render large BG screens.<br /><br />Parallax scrolling is just a particular case of translation (scrolling) different objects so they have different speed.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Jan 15, 2017 11:47 am</p><hr />

Well, I imagine they were using an early version of the bog-standard Fast3D microcode, and they claimed the game used ~60% of the system's power.  I bet with an optimized microcode they could have locked it at 60 fps without hurting the graphical complexity.<br /><br />The billboarded objects in Super Mario 64 didn't look bad at the time IMO (and nobody was complaining that I can recall - general consensus was that the game looked amazing).  Also, I'm not specifically accusing you of anything, but playing in emulation makes that stuff look worse because of the resolution mismatch.  The same thing happens in Mario Kart 64, in which the racers and weapons look awful pasted into a high-resolution 3D scene, even though they look perfectly serviceable on a real N64.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6595">93143</a> — Tue Jan 10, 2017 10:26 pm</p><hr />

Because it never really took off most of the times it's come up (3DS perhaps excepted?) it's kinda orthogonal.

(Point sprites are also a type of primitive on modern 3D hardware, BTW, mostly used for particle explosions and stuff.)<br /><br />You could probably make a big category just for SNES techniques owing to Mode 7 or other stuff that's specific to it.
