They mean that if you got the pinout wrong, or if you inserted the cartridge slightly misaligned, you don't damage anything.<br />Use one 0.1µF capacitor for each IC.

There are obvious workarounds, if you care. (e.g. use binary counters like the CD4040s that BriPro used, or parallel latches like 74HC374s )<br /><br />In any case, the Gameking games look like they're usually 1/4 the size of the smallest SNES game: it should be pretty fast.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You think Brian who is smart enough [... didn't] know what voltage his PC has?<br /></div>Smart people make stupid assumptions all the time. Neither he nor I are exceptions.<br /><br />In any case, the entire point is: we don't know what the ROM is under the epoxy blob. If we had a part number, we could look it up and see if it was 5V tolerant, but we don't, so we can't, so we do the most conservative thing so that we don't risk blowing up the ROM, which is to say, we run the entire thing at 3V.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Now do I have to connect pin 46 (s3)?

You probably need to connect both of the solitary traces, which look like they're what BriPro called pins 16 and 48. Which ... yes, differs from what's true for his. I have no idea what's going on, and unless we can get an oscilloscope or logic analyzer in there to figure out what's going on, we won't be able to find out. You should probably check and see if this is the same for all your cartridges, lest you overspecialize and have to modify it later.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Bankswitching is done by the CPU but the ROMs are on the cartridge.

Without being able to execute code on the Gameking, or monitor what's happening as a game is executing, the best we can do at first is just dump the contents of the ROM and stare at it until it makes sense.<br />As long as all the bits have arrived, even if it is scrambled it is pretty easy to re-shuffle all the bits without having to rewire and re-download everything.

At least, nothing's immediately obviously wrong it.<br /><br />The virtual protoboard is a little concerning, though: Why do you only have a few resistors on the protoboard? Each 1x5 segment of the protoboard is connected internally, so if you use that you're currently shorting out A0 to A1 and D0 to D1 and so on. Also, 10kOhm in series with Vcc is much too much.<br /><br />Increasing the speed (9600) should dramatically increase the rate at which you can download the data. You'll need to change it both in the program you send to the microcontroller and also in the serial program on the computer you use to receive the data.

I'm absolutely not sure about everything, including timing issues (also 9600 serial to USB conversion), CE, IRQ, INPUT, OUTPUT of the daisy chain, internal pull-up resistors, FTDI drivers and other stuff. No errors while compiling though. But that doesn't mean that it will work.<br /><br />For the protoboard. I haven't added all resistors and address lines (for the 2nd and 3rd 595) because of too many overlapping wires. Same logic than 1st device. I somewhere found 10k on most other similar (5V) project. But now I found 470 and 330.  Which to choose?<br /><br />I don't understand where is a 1x5 segment and why there's a problem. I did it according to other projects, however others most have 16 bits and additional chips, and according to a schematic someone recommended.<br />ADR lines to the shifting devices and Data lines to the Arduino.<br /><br />I still need the dumping time.

Then I found that optimized wiring at the 595s (what I had copied from an existing project).<br /><br /><br />There's also schematics and PCB layout but I haven't used them much. The parts on the schematics are not arranged and the wires are very thin and very light colored.

Not because of the pin distance (I have bent every other one up) but the wires won't stick (don't know about the material, maybe missing flux).<br /><br />I have ordered a 2nd slot. It's also possible to attach the lower socket pins to the cart pins and to insert wires into holes on the other side (considered for the upper pins). <br />I doubt that I can fix that both for more than 1 minute that way. I considered using other stuff like miniature clothespins or glue.<br />I have to think about that. It's also very risky to destroy the carts.<br /><br />Probably I have to ask LiraLuna or other expert who owns a dumping unit and socket and maybe send missing carts to him.<br /><br />Maybe it's not worth spending more time and money for that and maybe someone's reading all that and can manage that much earlier than I could.  <br />We can't do much anyway with a dump without understanding everything and having an emulator.<br />I've read that it should be a custom 6502.

Once you can execute arbitrary code on the Gameking, it's pretty easy to poke around things and see where they've stored any built-in games, and then transmit them.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't have enough knowledge (or time) for writing an emulator and reverse-engineering. Even LiraNuna who wrote or better tried the first emulator obviously couldn't understand all that and stopped that. Same for MESS.<br /><br />Unless I haven't found a solution for the socket and efficient coding, I probably can't do that. (However I will try continue soldering tomorrow).<br />Everyone (with more skills) could buy a cartrige, which isn't expensive, and dump that.<br />Maybe there's a reason why there's no emulator and no dumps. Sometimes I asked myself if Brian did all that or it's even a fake.<br />He built a devcart but no proof of how to handle the &quot;wrong cart error&quot; and any other code. Nobody can verify that. The only thing we have are some screencaps which could have been made manually. No infos about internal working, sound and everything else. And why he removed everything and withdraw a free license which isn't allowed? Very strange.<br /><br />I read about some other dumping methods like TapeDump on nesdev but the function of the EXT connector is also unknown (not sound output).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I now have soldered most of the wires and wait for the 2nd slot. I already searched for protoboards with a pitch &lt; 1&quot; for the socket and searched for other slots. <br /><br />I will restart my virtual protoboard and make it this time with the real schematics function. That will autotrace the protoboard wires (hardly to see and badly aligned though). I will then upload more pics.<br /><br />In the meantime I have found a 3rd person who obviously has dumped the carts, at least he owns even 4-in-1 carts and a compatible dumping unit. He measured the pins and said they are 512 KB. I wonder why mine has 20 ADR lines. I also think that they are 5V compatible. <br />Somehow I think it could be LiraNuna or Brian. Or maybe LiraNuna is even Brian. Similar blog title like Brian but time and collection more fits to LiraNuna. Although he mainly used the same nick.<br />I think most or all games have already been dumped and are or were available somewhere (LiraNuna said don't ask for ROMs, dump yourself or search the web). None of them will publish their dumps or emulating code for whatever reason.<br /><br />The games for Gameking 4 (not Gameking game compatible but NES games, but probably with Gameking pinouts)  have also been dumped. Someone said that this NES compatible handheld also plays Gameking games. But I doubt that. Completely different screen. <br /><br />Any more help with the protoboard, code or socket building?
