<br />
<br />I'm going to have to try to make a wall sconce with an animated flame in it or something.
<br />
<br />And yeah, I didn't think about the perpendicular wall dithering, you do need shading for that to help visualize the layout.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But honestly, I think that a level where all walls use the same two colors would be pretty boring. I'd much rather have monochrome textures in more colorful levels.</div>
<br />
<br />I don't know, the three bright blocks just feel odd to me.  They'd definitely be good for forming a mental map of the level and representing different areas, but their forced monochrome just feels limiting to me.  You can do a lot with even two different colors.  Personally I wouldn't be averse to it for individual mazes/maps because I wouldn't expect a lot of color variation in a rocky cave or castle dungeon, but I guess it depends on how it ends up looking in the engine.
<br />
<br />For example, a mossy rock wall sort of thing:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/5633/37067718.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Or just using two different solid colors:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/9553/30000304.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />You could still show different areas by alternating the primary color you use in texturing.  In fact I think it would be cool to use different textures to gradually dither the walls - you start in a dark purple room and as you walk down a corridor it fades to a light blue, etc.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img36.imageshack.us/img36/6550/68847246.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Of course you can do that in monochrome too...it's your project, I don't mean to tell you how to do it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />EDIT: Here's an expanded castle set, with animated wall sconce:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img121.imageshack.us/img121/2844/castlev.gif" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Although the fire looks splashy, not flamey.  I'll see if I can fix it.
<br />
<br />Here are some more tries:

<br />I might try better textures (and colors), like the ones UncleSporky made, but the resolution isn't going to improve. I can barely sustain a decent frame rate as it is.
<br />
<br />Anyway, this wasn't meant to look great. I knew the resolution would be very low from the start, but that was one of the characteristics that made my design possible.
<br />
<br />If anyone else has different ideas on how to implement a raycaster that will allow for more resolution/colors, I'd love to see that (this is not sarcasm or a "challenge", I'd really like to see that).

This would take care of the resolution problem, but textures would still be an issue. You <em>could</em> also make wireframes out of simple shapes on each wall, and then fill those. That might take too much processing time, and look really stupid though.

<br />This is possibly a bit unrelated, and I know wireframe games are not unknown on old consoles (stuff like Elite) but I was just informed of this Gameboy game called X that I think looks pretty cool:

<br />A DSiware game called X-Scape just came out which is apparently a sequel.

I really like to see these old machines running raycasters. The basic engine in this isn't very advanced (yet?) though... The walls are not textured (this is one of the biggest speed killers in my engine), they get jagged a lot (this happens when you use little steps for the rays instead of precalculating larger steps, because of rounding errors) and are fisheye distorted. If they fix these issues this game is gonna be much more interesting!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Looks like they have the beginnings of a game there, with a map and menu.  If they can do that on CV, I bet you can do something better on NES!</div><br />I could probably use my engine in a game, but I'm sure the frame rate would drop noticeably, and I find slow games annoying. My current idea for drawing sprites doesn't look very promising, since I couldn't think of many tricks to speed it up like I managed to do with the walls, so I'm afraid of how much they will affect the overall performance. I'll never know if I don't try, I know...! =)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But then the ColecoVision has almost the same CPU as a Game Boy, which runs FaceBall 2000.</div>
<br />But at a lower clock speed, right? Also it has less RAM. By comparing this raycaster to mine, and the features that each one sports, I think the NES has the upper hand here. I still think the CV has a lot of potential, and I'm definitely curious to see how far this project goes. They can probably display much more colorful screens than I can, in case they decide to add textures and stuff.

<br />ColecoVision, ZX Spectrum, Master System, Game Gear: 3.58 MHz Zilog Z80
<br />Game Boy: 4.19 MHz Sharp CPU similar to Z80
<br />
<br />I guess the difference between a Spectrum (which can run <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW_XDSFdn-4" class="postlink">an impressive textured FPS</a>) and a ColecoVision isn't the clock speed as much as the fact that (as you pointed out) the Spectrum and Game Boy have a poopload more RAM.

<br />I seem to remember that the video memory is directly accessible by the CPU on the Spectrum, is that correct? That probably makes display manipulation faster.
<br />
<br />Technically, the ColecoVision could display something as colorful as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3Oqz5WjDPI" class="postlink">M.O.O.D.</a>, which is an advantage it has over the NES.
