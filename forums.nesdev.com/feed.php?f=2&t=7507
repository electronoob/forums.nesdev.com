I cut out the Cinema Scenes but the rest of the game is there and works. It fits into 128K (though without much to spare) even though it was 256KB before. The Cinema stuff takes up about half of the CHR and probably half of the used PRG.<br /><br />There is no room in BG graphics for a status bar. For sprites, I wouldn't really know how to go about trying to dynamically load the current animation frame. There are no clones (Phantom Doubles is their actual name) in NG1, only NG2. So the idea does work assuming you actually have enough time to transfer all the tiles needed each frame.<br /><br />An idea that might also work for a slimmed down Status bar would be to redraw the Item Pickup boxes to reuse and reduce the total tiles used to try to have enough for a status bar. Something like 20 - 24 or maybe more tiles are used by items the player can pickup. So if you cut these down you could probably get to still display the life bars, Score, Chi (special weapon ammo), current level, and time.<br /><br />Not planning on releasing anything about it on UNROM since the ROM is far too different for any IPS patches or anything like that to not contain huge amounts of copyrighted material. But it could have been done though for the Cinema's I think UOROM would have been needed for the capacity. But I guess that just again proves you don't need a fancy mapper to make a good game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Thu Mar 03, 2011 12:26 am</p><hr />

I was reluctant to disable my NMI because I'm doing sprite 0 hit for my status bar.  So whenever I disable my NMI interrupt during gameplay, everything goes to hell.  <br /><br />Let me describe real quick what I did.  A lot of this will be real basic to a lot of you, but just in case it might help some other people with a similar issue in the future.<br /><br />I took advantage of a variable already in my NMI handler.  This variable (called sleeping) gets set to 0 at the end of the NMI handler just before the registers are restored.  In the gameloop, it doesn't proceed past the continuous loop into the rest of the engine unless this "sleeping" is 0 (meaning NMI has fired).  This particular process I learned from Metalslime, but of course it's a variant of what a lot of you do in your gameloops.<br /><br />I basically applied the same thing to the PRG bank switching subroutine.  At the end of the sub, it now checks if the variable is 0.  If not, it branches to RTS.  If it is, then it resets the MMC1 latch by writing $80 to $8000 (just to be safe) and then jumps back to the beginning of the sub to re-write to REG3.  Also, I've now added a couple of lines pushing my current PRG bank # to the stack (where the registers get pushed) at the beginning on NMI and pulling at the end.  Yeah, I think this describes all of what I did.<br /><br />Regardless, I set a breakpoint on the new part of bankswitching sub and it's working exactly like I needed it to.  Also tested it on the NES and there wasn't any noticeable slowdown.  Then again, I should hope not, as it's only dropping one of 60 frames about 3% of the time.  (This bug frame overflow was really random, another thing that made it so damn hard to find.)  <br /><br />It's still going to be my policy to keep things within the frame as much as possible, but it's nice to have this safegaurd here in case that doesn't happen.<br /><br />Thanks for the help folks!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4230">bigjt_2</a> — Wed Feb 23, 2011 9:49 pm</p><hr />

I've been told that I overcomplicate things when I suggest newbies use more robust NMI handlers, but it's almost a certainty that one day they will reach the CPU's limit, and then they'll be dealing with a very hard to track bug. One could argue that dealing with this problem is a part of the learning process, and I kinda agree, but there are cases when fixing this is very frustrating because it requires great changes in the game's architecture.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Feb 23, 2011 8:43 pm</p><hr />

Yep, found the problem.  Clueless' first hypothesis was correct:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">clueless wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Part way through changing the MMC1 bank via the 'lsr, sta' unrolled loop, your code gets interrupted, and the interrupt handler resets the latch, changes banks, does its work, then resets the bank back to what it found on entry.  Your "main" thread then resumes banging out the final bits tot he MMC1 bank register, which is no longer properly latched, so the MMC1 sees an incomplete switch request.<br /></div><br /><br />My problem in bug-checking was that I was ONLY checking for this sound engine backup-bank/switch-bank routine I described in the first post.  However, as I explained, many different sections of code utilize the simple PRG bank switching subroutine.  The PRG bank always gets backed up before jumping to it and then restored later when the engine is ready to return to the other swappable banks.  When I did a check for the actual bank-switch sub, on the immediate previous occurance this sub was called it was indeed cut up by my NMI.  It only got through four writes to $E000 and then NMI happened.<br /><br />Ugh... I thought I'd had my code timed better to keep everything condensed within one frame, but it appears I was wrong.<br /><br />Now I first started thinking of trying to let the problem go away as I further optimized the code, but it seems like I'd better have one of the fixes you guys mentioned just in case the code does spill out of frame here and there, like some of the extra checks within the sub that Bregalad mentioned and so on.  Like I said, I thought I had everything safely working within the frame with twenty-odd scanlines to spare, but I may be getting to the point on my project where it's too hard to gae-ron-tee that everything will fit within the frame 100% of the time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4230">bigjt_2</a> — Wed Feb 23, 2011 8:01 pm</p><hr />
