To skip forward to the beginning of the NMI handler (241), click Run Line in the debugger window.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Maybe start backing up your code so you can go back to when it was working, helps you learn what broke. Simplest way to do that would be to copy your code to a new folder and date/timestamp it, each time you're happy with progress you've made.   Eventually you might even want to pick up git or svn to automate this. I use git all the time even for small experiments like this one.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey 8bitmicroguy, I was able to figure out what was going wrong with your program. First, you were using the wrong banks for your code:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br />&nbsp; .bank 3<br />&nbsp; .org $C000<br />&nbsp; include &quot;battle3_dpcm.asm&quot;<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; .bank 4<br />&nbsp; .org $E000<br /></div><br /><br />Replace these with:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br /><br />&nbsp; .bank 2<br />&nbsp; .org $C000<br />&nbsp; include &quot;battle3_dpcm.asm&quot;<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; .bank 3<br />&nbsp; .org $E000<br /><br /></div><br /><br />Then your rom will execute---you've still got some problems though as the music sounds messed up. You're doing a couple of things wrong. You shouldn't be setting nmi within nmi, for one. I would recommend against reading the controller within nmi, as well, you should do this in your main thread, and have some mechanism for synchronizing your main thread/loop with nmi. Hopefully that'll get you started.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I know, I should have used #s for immediate operand.<br /><br />I fixed the GGSound bug that's in the other topic. But I still get the stuttering. I just don't know how to debug this. I have another demo where these button latches work perfectly fine. I looked up the hex-editor and see that the controller latches perfectly fine.<br /><br />Two bytes are reserved for each controller. The first byte has the current presses and the second one has the presses of the previous frame. They are bitwise compared for &quot;edge detection&quot; as in &quot;pressed this frame&quot; and &quot;released this frame&quot;.<br /><br />I'll be tweaking until I find out what's going on.
