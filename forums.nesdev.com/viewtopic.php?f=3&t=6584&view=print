<br />
<br />I traced out the extra LS chips to see what they were for, but they ended up not being related. LS20 for WRAM CE control and LS139 for supporting a 2nd PRG ROM and something A12 related (more on this later)
<br />
<br />Anyways the bug here is mainly due to the piggybacking of 2 wiring configs into mapper 25 (A0,A1) and (A2,A3). This game uses the A0,A1 config but at the end of the game for whatever reason writes to C004-C007 instead C000-C003. If the emulator was using the correct address mask (F003), this wouldn't an issue, but instead they combine the masks for both configs something like:
<br />
<br />addr = (addr &amp; F003h) | ( (addr &amp; 0Ch) &gt;&gt; 2)
<br />
<br />Which in this case causes the wrong banking routines to be called.
<br />
<br />Nestopia (which can tell the difference between the 2 using its DB) still suffers from this problem because it doesn't use an address mask and instead assigns handlers directly to C000,C001,C002,C003 so the writes to C004-C007 go unnoticed.
<br />
<br />On a side note, this cart doesn't seem to support one-screen mirroring for some reason. Writing to 9000h, bit 0 is for H/V as usual but bit 1 is ignored.
<br />
<br />Here is rough routing of the relevant LS pins if anyone cares. I wasn't real thorough, could be missing something. If someone with a better understanding of electronics than me can tell me what the point of the 1st LS139 decoder is, I'm curious to know. It seems like A12 would just pass thru it in all cases.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know what VRC37 is exactly, but it's not passing through, the demultiplexer being enabled with the PRG /CE.  This is the kind of timing you would want for reading/writing the bus.
<br />
<br />The logic is this:
<br />
<br />if - the CPU addresss is above $8000
<br />and - M2/Phi2 is high
<br />and - PRG A12 is low
<br />then - VRC 37 is active
<br />
<br />The result is that it'll be active when $8xxx, $Axxx, $Cxxx, $Exxxx are accessed.  If A12 was passed through, it would also go active at $6xxx, $4xxxx, $2xxx, $0xxx, and also not during the usual time of the bus cycle (M2 being high).
<br />edit: maybe I got the addresses wrong, I didn't check

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I guess I figured it was something along these lines, but what seems strange about this is that the VRC2 / 4 must already have this type of behavior built-in to the mapper itself, as most other VRC games do not have additional logic like this and yet do not have any bus-conflict problems.

<br />
<br />Actually, leaving only &amp;F003 doesn't solves the problem.
<br />
<br />sequence is 
<br />$C, $F, $F, $F, $F, $D, $F, $C 
<br />$C007-$C004, $B003-$B000 accordingly
<br />
<br />masked addresses
<br />$C003-$C000, $B003-$B000
<br />
<br />so banks are
<br />bank0 - $DC, bank1 - $FF, bank2 - $FF, bank3 - $CF
<br />
<br />but game expect
<br />bank0 - $FC, bank1 - $FD, bank2 - $FF, bank3 - $CF
<br />
<br />so we have here strange "on the fly" mapper behaviour switching,
<br />all game uses:
<br />bank 0 - hi B002, lo B000 10 00
<br />bank 1 - hi B003, lo B001 11 01
<br />bank 2 - hi C002, lo C000 10 00
<br />bank 3 - hi C003, lo C001 11 00
<br />
<br />sprite-based staff subtitles uses:
<br />bank0 - hi B001, lo B000 01 00
<br />bank1 - hi B003, lo B002 11 10
<br />bank2 - hi C001, lo C000 01 00
<br />bank3 - hi C003, lo C002 11 10
<br />
<br />so we have here accidentally A0 and A1 swap... but there is no any other register setup performed by game to switch to this behaviour...
<br />
<br />my crazy idea was if A2 for C0xx area control bitswap for first four 1K CHR banks lol, it's even simple to emulate, but actually this will for sure broke any game using A2, A3 as mapper control bits...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Damn you Konami! So the correct mask fixes the Cxxx writes (perhaps by chance, the odd Ax line swap wouldn't affect it in this case) but the Bxxx writes load the wrong banks.
<br />
<br />The VRC2 has no A2 connection in this case, so the fact that A2 is set in the Cxxx writes (for whatever reason) couldn't be a trigger for this hypothetical alt mode. Using CopyNES, I tried all sorts of various combos to see if I could invoke said mode, including the specific sequence you mentioned, but I always got the expected "normal" results.
<br />
<br />The extra LS logic certainly doesn't seem to be a factor here.
<br />
<br />I'll take another look at it when I have a chance, but I must say I'm a bit stumped right now <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />the current emulation problem is that text in the ending sequence is screwed.
