The CLK pin is rapidly oscillating between 0 and 5 V all the time, so it should show up somewhere in-between when averaged by your voltmeter.<br />Additionally adding the meter puts enough load on the pin that the CPU and/or PPU may no longer understand the incoming voltages. But that's harmless and should go away shortly after you remove the meter.

Not certain how to do that without some kind of logic analyzer or a &gt;2 channel scope (A0, A1, Dx)<br /><br />What game are you testing with? Do you get similar results regardless of the game? Finally, do you have the ability to program a cartridge?

Repeat with negative probe at +5v pin of the CPU and positive at A1.<br /><br />If you can try it at another address line, maybe A12 and see if they both measure identical (they should if the pins are not damaged and they're completely disconnected from the rest of the system) the fault might be elsewhere.

I guess that makes it a lot more difficult.<br /><br />@l_oliveira: by 'completely disconnected', do you mean like I did with A1 (i.e. cut off)? In that case I haven't done it with any other pin.<br />But I measured with a multimeter anyway and the value was higher on A1 than the rest of the Ax pins, but maybe that's just because it's cut off?
