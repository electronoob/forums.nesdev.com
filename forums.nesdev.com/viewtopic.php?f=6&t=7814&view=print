		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is my attempt at converging all NSFs known to me and ones that I could find and ones that I have ripped. The idea is to have a archive that only has NSFs extracted from ROMs. Almost always, from commercial games, licensed or unlicensed.
<br />
<br />A good deal of the NSFs in this master archive are from Knurek. He done a good job on archiving. Based on what he had told me; that he didn't have time to update them. So, his archive on the website is about a year and a half out of date.
<br />
<br />But now, I need some help tracking down NSFs that could be missing from the archive and listing those that need to be fixed. That would be a great help in getting this archive complete.
<br />
<br />Also, Shiru told me that he could make a tool for NSFs. And now I am thinking about how it would be done. I assume it would be similar to the GoodNES tools with a few differences. However, I would like to listen to any ideas.
<br />
<br />As said earlier; I followed the naming convention of Knurek's archive and also I have listed fixes with the code (Fx) x being which number the fix is. For example (F1).
<br />
<br />My idea is to have a tool to generate a list with checksums and also to state how many are missing and which ones are not on the list after being scanned. 
<br />
<br />Here is the archive to look though here. You can browse through the directories or download the 7-Zip with all of them.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I knew I should have done my idea sooner.  I've had NSFREPO.COM since late 2009 for the purpose of what Gil Galad is doing, more or less.  My idea was to keep it segregated from the Parodius line of hosting stuff but put a small amount of Google ads on it, solely to see if I could generate enough self-sufficient revenue to, in effect, "get Parodius to pay for itself".  Guess I'll have to find a new idea.
<br />
<br />My idea was to have a full-blow NSF archive site, with full details of every NSF (extracted from them directly), MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256 checksums of each, support people to upload their own NSFs, comments and a rating system, and basically a publicly-editable (well, not 100% anonymous; e.g. only specific users given access to it) database of all those NSF details.  The goal was to turn it into a "NES music repo" in a sense, listing of all the song composers, etc. etc...  And also to include/provide improperly-ripped NSFs or buggy ones, since there's lots of those around (certain songs missing notes or freaking out due to someone ripping it wrong).  Folks could use a Windows (or whatever; write it in C and make it work on all OSes) tool to query the NSF archive site to find out details about the .nsf file they had (using checksums).  "Oh, the NSF I have is the buggy one, screw this!"  You get the idea.
<br />
<br />Gil, if you're interested in the domain, I'd be more than happy to hand it to you (no charge) rather than watch it expire and go into the hands of a domain squatter.
<br />
<br />BTW, I'm not sure if you got these or not, but don't forget about Kevtris's NSF collection too!  Search the web for nsfcoll.zip.  :-)

<br />I just added a link to the nsfcoll.zip on another site. I do also have that archive on my PC somewhere.
<br />
<br />Yes, I would be interested in the webspace. Except that I believe I don't have the skill to build such a site with a database, user editable site and one that could communicate with a application to determine what NSF file you have.
<br />
<br />Thanks B00daW for the update and I may remove some of those soon.
<br />
<br />Also, I'd like to know if you guys think I should remove the company/publisher names out of the file names, with the exception of games that have the same name?

<br />I'm not big into the NSF world (yet) so I'm not sure how much my opinion matters, but I find the company/publisher information of games (and music) to be interesting and neat historical info.  Would be a shame to lose pre-existing information...why remove it?

<br />
<br />The publishing/developing company does NOT equal the artist. And I hate that some people treat it that way. Mega Man music is not done by Capcom. Castlevania music is not done by Konami. These are soulless entities.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I think you should keep the publisher and developer company in the file names. It is indeed useful information.
<br />
<br />And I love you are doing this. I hope for a single complete definitive archive of NSF and a neat Goodtools-like program for it.

<br />
<br />Well it sounded like you were saying "keep it in, they deserve it" in response to Gil's question as to whether he should keep the publishing/developer company names, and equating them to the artist. That's how I read it, anyway. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />I think searching by company would also be useful.

<br />
<br />I just removed all the redundant NSFs as well as fixing Um Chi and Bensheng 4-in-1 Table Tennis. Both of them had the wrong load address and that was caused by NSF Tool (optimizer version). I haven't uploaded them yet though. Also, I renamed the numbered set to 0-9 because my client and/host doesn't like files named and starting with the character #. That missing folder will also be uploaded later. I also added Star Tropics 2 that was missing.

<br />I should be clear here: I'm not offering web hosting/space.  I'm offering the domain name for your use (your own hosting provider could configure their webservers and/or DNS servers to handle it, for example), e.g. I could transfer it to you (to a registrar you prefer), or point the associated DNS servers to your own provider.  "Webspace" != domain name; two separate things.
