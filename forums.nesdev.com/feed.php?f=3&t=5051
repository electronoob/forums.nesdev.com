It's not really that I have hatred for TAS speedrun, but I find it really annoying when I'm looking for an actual speedrun to find only "WOOW MY GOD XXX GAME IN ONLY 27 SEC" to find a movie of the hero teleporting to the last boss room, defeting it with heavy cheating and see the ending. This is not a speedrun.<br /><br />Altough there is good tool asisted speedruns, like I remember one who did Castlevania : Circle of the moon in slightly more than 20 minutes which was awesome it was very weird and turned into a skeleton to kill all bosses in one hit.<br /><br />So while some TAS sucks, some others can be great. With regular speedruns you are sure that they are fair and even more impressive. But tool asisted stuff can be more fun at times.<br /><br />Also it is wrong to say that tool assisted speedruns are always clearly labeled at such. I have seen many speedruns on Youtube that were not labeled as tool assisted, but that seems to have been done with other cheats than just savestates.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Apr 15, 2009 12:09 pm</p><hr />

Yep, a TAS is similar to a Hollywood movie: use whatever tools you can to get the on-screen effect you want. That means re-taking scenes many times when the actors mess up or whatever, using computers and stop-motion filming to get really intricate sequences, etc. One difference is that a TAS may not do anything beyond what can be done by sending the game a sequence of button presses as a controller could generate, otherwise it really is just a movie rather than an intricate puzzle.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Wed Apr 15, 2009 11:43 am</p><hr />

I guess that teleports are often the result of collision detection issues (like when a character gets stuck into a wall and is ejected from it, either to the other side or to the top), or coordinate system issues (unusual coordinates are misinterpreted and the characters shows up somewhere else). High jumps, I believe, are the result of jumping again at the exact frame where the engine is not certain if the character is on the ground or not. In some games (SMB is one of them, I think) you can jump when pressed against a wall if the character is vertically aligned with a wall block that is perceived as floor.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Apr 14, 2009 8:42 am</p><hr />

I originally added this filter to my emulator after spending a long time chasing a bug in the Battletoads snake pit levels. Pressing left+right causes your character to float upwards, and not go back down when you release them. Since that game has such tricky timing and delays enabling rendering, I spent the longest time looking for timing bugs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Tue Apr 14, 2009 8:34 am</p><hr />

I actually don't worry about what can and cannot be pressed on a hardware level, I just assume everything can. I don't get any bugs because my logic/physics does not collapse if opposing directions are pressed. If left and right are pressed at the same time, my engine will just take both forces into account, and the character will most likely just stand there, no problem. If it was walking in one direction and the opposite key was pressed (while the other remained pressed), the character would just slow down because of the opposing force and eventually stop.<br /><br />I didn't have to deal with up and down yet (because I haven't used up), but I'd probably handle it using states, favoring the current state. If the character was looking down and the player pressed up, I'd look into the request of looking up, but wouldn't allow it since the character was currently looking down (as I wouldn't for many other states, such as jumping, getting hurt, etc). Same thing if it was looking up, I'd deny a look down until it stopped looking up.<br /><br />I really feel that this problem is best resolved at the game logic level. If you filter keys at the hardware level (the emulator does it for you or you do it on your joypad reading routine) you loose the power to prioritize keypresses on a case-by-case basis. blargg's solution is interesting, but what if for some reason during a specific portion of my game I need to prioritize the key that was pressed first (as opposed to the most recent)?<br /><br />Just out of curiosity, I just checked how Sonic 1 and 2 handle the looking up/down thing. It just prioritizes looking up, which I think is wrong. I know that some NES games have bugs when opposing directions are pressed, and I see this as sloppy coding, right along with visible scrolling artifacts and other "pearls" present in so called "professional" games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Apr 13, 2009 8:55 pm</p><hr />
