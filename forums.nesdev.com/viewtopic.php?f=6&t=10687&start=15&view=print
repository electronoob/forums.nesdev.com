I assume you are talking about locations in the .nes rom right? I looked at my .nes in hexedit and noticed the code for vegaplay looks like it starts way down at $7A10. So $7900 through $7A00 look free to me. <br /><br />So if I understand you correctly I need to alter the asm to read <div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ClearSprites:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; STA $500, x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; INX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BNE ClearSprites<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LDA #$00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; STA $2003&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; set the low byte (00) of the RAM address<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LDA #$79<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; STA $4014&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; set the high byte (05) of the RAM address<br /><br />LoadSprites:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LDX #$00<br />LoadSpritesLoop:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LDA sprites, x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; load data from address<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; STA $7900, x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; store into RAM address<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; INX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CPX #4<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BNE LoadSpritesLoop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RTS</div> instead of the way it was before with $500 in the LoadSprites SDA spot and in the ClearSprites LDA spot. <br /><br />Where do I add the code for the $2004 register like you described? There is already a spot with those variables in the code that looks like <div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">sprites:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;vert tile attr horiz<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .db $37, $2D, $00, $18&nbsp; ; sprite</div><br /><br />Just simply changing what I have above doesn't do the trick I know there is more to what you told me, but I'm too new at this to know how to proceed.

I assume it's somewhere inside the MML bundle, but changing either is sufficient.<br /><br />As far as what I was suggesting: I made the modifications and have attached them. To explain exactly what I did:<br /><ul><li>I added a NES-2.0 compliant header (because why not)</li><li>I removed the redundant clearing of memory at $0800 and $0900</li><li>I increased the startup time to wait 2-3 vblanks instead of 1-2</li><li>It no longer clears the picture on screen when it boots, because it uploads the actual picture immediately afterwards</li><li>I made the sound initialization comply with what the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NSF" class="postlink">NSF page says on nesdevwiki</a></li><li>I moved the pointer that used $10 and $11 to something explicitly allocated at the top of the asm file</li><li>I threw away the old sprites code and replaced it with my minimized one that takes advantage of the NES's design and avoids its bugs. (In short: The NES guarantees that the sprites pointer is 0 at the end of normal rendering. Actively changing the sprites pointer causes corruption, so I avoid it by using the above. We don't actually need to clear the entirety of sprite memory every vertical refresh as I suggested doing in my previous post, so now I do it only once)</li><li>I shaved off 144 more bytes for your NSF.</li></ul><br />I hope I haven't ruined your fun by doing it for you ... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" />

(And lidnariq beat me to it AGAIN!!!!)<br /><br />I guess alternates are always good...<br /><br />Here is Vegaplay completely free of sprites and (hopefully) most other stuff that would cause incompatibility. Barely tested, though. Should support up to 10 songs without customization. Cursor tile is customizable. <br /><br />If you want to change where it appears, edit cursornametablehi and cursornametablelo.<br /><br />&quot;How do I know what to put there?&quot; Open your rom in FCEUX. Debug, nametable viewer. Move your mouse where you want to put the cursor. At the bottom right, you'll see PPU address. The first two characters go in cursornametablehi, the second two go in cursornametablelo.<br /><br />I could make this slightly better (animated cursor wouldn't be too hard to do at least), but who knows if I ever will. Enjoy.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Since I'm going to be filling my rom up with as much music as possible should I choose a location like $7900?</div><br />That's not a valid place to start a ROM. Don't aim to use more than you have. $8000 through $FFF9 minus the bytes vegaplay uses.<br /><br />Edit: Also, if you want more than say... 23 songs, this probably has to be modified to scroll. (I say 23, not 30 to make some room for title graphics/safe area).<br /><br />Edit2: Silly me, uploaded a broken file. Tried to move something to make it easier to edit, not realizing of course it wouldn't assemble.<br /><br />Edit3: Fixed wrong cursor offsets for later songs. Whoops. I wasn't kidding when I said barely tested.

You've only allowed my fun to actually continue. I enjoy making music and modding hardware. I start cracking my head open when I have to start programming or debugging in a difficult and foreign language such as NES assembly. I can't thank you guys enough. You guys are all diamonds. <br /><br />Do either of you foresee any conflicts that might arise from using most of the memory when I'm nearing completion of the album? I know I can only go so far with it, but will it stop me with the same issue somewhere like half way though my work or can I get pretty much most out of this configuration? And also if I do run into some issues down the line could I message either of you guys for more help?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here's one that allows you to customize the cursor animation. To change the animation, set the length with NumberOfFrames, then add/subtract bytes from cursoranimation as needed. All frames will show up for the same amount of time (CursorDelay). If you want variable delays, find the least common multiple of the delays you want and double up tiles as needed.<br /><br />That's about as far as I go, unless I broke it again somehow. The more things you want, the harder it is to make customizable anyhow.

Or do you want it to be part of the transition animation? Or something else?</div><br /><br />Yeah just like a single loop. I will probably be building some frames to make the curser look like its rotating or bouncing (all within the 8x8 tile of course.) So I could make like three or four tiles of curser animation and it will loop continuously.  and if it's is possible maybe like a smooth transition to the next location whenever changing songs (like tweening) <br /><br />I'm downloading your new version now, Kasumi.<br /><br />Edit: I tried out you code Kasumi and I noticed that you changed the chr page that the curser used to the same one the background uses. Was that on purpose? I used to put all my curser graphics in page 2 but now it's scrolling though tiles from my background. My preference would be to have the cursers on there own chr page, cause I want as many tiles as I can manage for my back ground graphics. I know it'll only be like 3-4 tiles lost but I could very easily be needing those tiles later on with the plans I have.
