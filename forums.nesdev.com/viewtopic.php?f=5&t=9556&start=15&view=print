		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have really bad luck with hard drives (especially WD), so I just use RAID mirroring and be done with it. It seems expensive at first (double the price for the same capacity), but when you hear a drive going clickity click, you know you don't have to waste a day setting up your environment again. I use the Intel Matrix RAID because the drive is still readable if you plug it into any old SATA controller. The RAID data is also on the drive (not on the controller NVRAM), so if your controller bites it you're not SOL.<br /><br />I still use Dropbox/Google Drive on my really important stuff (code, projects, etc).

In RAID 5, you lose everything and have to go back to tape or the cloud. In RAID 10, you have only a 33 percent chance of losing everything: only a 1+2 or 3+4 failure causes loss, while a 1+3, 1+4, 2+3, or 2+4 loss is survivable.

But I've lost data to hard drive failures once in 25 years, ever, and it would have been solved by real backups instead. And meanwhile I've lost data ~30 times to my stupidity^W^W and at least 8 times due to filesystem corruption.<br /><br />The infamous JWZ says it more bitterly/amusingly than I would: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.jwz.org/blog/?p=801607">http://www.jwz.org/blog/?p=801607</a><!-- m -->

RAID redundancy is no substitute for backups, but it's still good protection against failure of a single drive (which is a common enough occurrence that I think it's worth doing in some cases).

You know the frustration when you've typed a long post and your web browser eats it before you click Post? Imagine that multiplied by 100000, all because you didn't take the time to make a backup (write your web post in a text editor rather than the browser).

In the real world, one usually needs to make trade-offs between cost/performance/reliability.  If I need a large amount of storage for an application with low IO requirements, RAID10 is probably not the best choice.  Certainly not from a cost perspective.

Though, arguably, if downtime is that costly, you're looking at an HA solution (e.g., a duplicate system).  The point I was trying to make is that there is no one-size-fits-all solution here.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, RAID-1 has been working fine for me for years. Drive fails, swap in another one, keep on going... If I were to loose both drives, I wouldn't have lost anything that can't be replaced, since all _MY_ files are on Dropbox and Google Drive. What RAID-1 saves me is all the trouble of reinstalling the OS and setting up my environment.<br /><br />I'm aware you can rsync on Mac/BSD/Linux because the file system doesn't lock files like Windows. Unfortunately, I'm using Windows.<br /><br />I prefer to think of it this way:<br />If your house burnt down while you were away, would all _YOUR_ critical data still be backed up?<br /><br />95% of the data on my drive is just Music/Games/Movies that take up lots of space and can easily be replaced. Yeah, its a pain to download it all again, but I haven't lost anything permanently.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />RAID protects from some hardware failures, downtime. But it's an exact mirror, so doesn't save you from non-hardware-caused data loss. Separate backup protects you from hardware failure, and from accidentally deleting files, filesystem corruption, etc. Off-site protects from theft, house fire, etc. Also, incremental backups protect from undetected corruption that gets copied to the more recent backup(s).

The X25-M is somewhat &quot;old&quot; and AFAIR does not use encryption, but like every SSD, does rely on an FTL.<br /><br />Moral of the story: do not think even for a minute that SSDs are impervious to physical damage.  They aren't.  Just because something lacks moving parts doesn't mean something can't be broken when given a good jostle.  <strong>Do regular backups</strong>.  And like others have already said: RAID is not a replacement (nor a supplement) for backups.

Linux wouldn't mount it, and neither would Windows.<br />I restored the 80GB SSD from the exact same 6 month old backup, and this time Windows booted on the first try.
