That's right, over 4 times what it will cost in the US (US$400). This is disgusting. Not that I want a PS4 or anything (or an Xbox One or anything current-gen for that matter), but it's outrageous that something like this can happen. I know our country's import taxes suck balls, but Microsoft somehow (maybe they have factories or assembly lines here?) managed to get the Xbox One down to R$2.200 (US$1,017.85), despite it being US$100 more expensive than the PS4 in the US, so Sony is probably doing something wrong here. I just hope it sells very poorly, and with a price like this I believe I don't even have to hope very hard...

USD 497<br /><br />It's surprinsing that it's a &quot;normal&quot; price for a brand new video game console. The PS3 was priced above 1000 CHF which was a huge shock back then, as all other consoles were usually in the CHF 300-500 range when they came out.<br /><br />But there is also the price of games. 10 years ago back when it happened to me to buy new PS2 games, they were CHF 99 (USD 109 at current rate, but it was more like USD 80 with the conversion rate back then) while the same brand new games were $40 in USA and even less in Japan.

Some of the difference can be attributed to higher sales tax in Europe and the fact that sticker prices in Europe include sales tax. I wonder how much of the rest of the difference is due to having to hire voice actors in multiple languages, get the games rated under multiple countries' rating systems, license the underlying book or film on which a game is based from the publishers' exclusive representatives in multiple countries, etc. I also seem to remember it being more expensive to ship from China and Japan to Europe than to the west coast of North America.

This means you could probably put DC into most computer power supplies, I wonder what the dropout voltage is. Would be an interesting test to see the lowest DC voltage a computer PSU could handle.

This thought came up a while back when people were talking about running their NES with DC. Not saying it would be a problem in either case, just that it's a potential issue.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Would be an interesting test to see the lowest DC voltage a computer PSU could handle.</div><br />A snag here is that the lower the voltage, the higher the current (since a switching supply is essentially a negative resistance). Electric distribution uses high voltage because they can run more power as long as they keep the current low (power=current x volts). So at some point you might exceed an internal current rating with lowering the voltage, even though it's drawing the same amount of power.
