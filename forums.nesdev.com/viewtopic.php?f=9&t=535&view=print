<br />Flash uses a completely different technology than EEPROM's.  Some of the advantages are that they can be erased electrically and re-programmed in-circuit (no need to pull them out of the board, no need for UV lamp).  They have some "quirks" like only being able to erase an entire block at a time, but that doesn't negatively affect their use as ROM replacements.

<br />The advantages of flash are it's availability, price and potential capacity.

<br />
<br />Any memory will work just as well as an EPROM. Some EPROM programmers can erase Flash, some can't. If you have a universal programmer, chances are it can erase at least the more popular Flash brands.

<br />Sorry, I wasn't clear with my response.  Most EEPROM cannot be programmed in-circuit without providing a programming voltage, which is usually very high like 12v.  Most flash can be programmed at Vcc in-circuit.  This is very handy because you can create parallel port cable to connect to your PC on one side, and the cart connector on the other, and re-program your flash without even opening the plastic cover on the cart (and without a programmer).  I don't think this is possible with EEPROM, though I have to admit I gave up on EEPROM many years ago so maybe they have gotten more advanced.
<br />You are absolutely right that flash is much cheaper, and with EEPROM going the way of the dinosaur also much easier to obtain.

<br />- What is the max size of flash available (EPROM is 2 MegaByte, so it can become short for 4 MByte or 6 MByte SNES games, a combination of chips are needed). Also EEPROM is 32 Kbyte max. so only NROM and CNROM board will work with them.

<br />Yes, all IC with JEDEC pinouts should be similar or identical for transparent use. The largest common 8-bit EPROM I know of is the 27c320 which is 32mbit. EEPROM can be far more than 32kbytes, I know there are 4mbit EEPROM (28c040) and there are likely some obscure ones even larger.

<br />
<br />as far as electronic. all I know is the things we were got to know in our physics class and by building stuff like n64-&gt;printer port stuff that I've found on the net and soldering modchips..  and of course my crappy gba boot cabel <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />In-circuit programming is easy.  As long as you don't have mapper registers in the same location are ROM data.  Find a flash or other chip that programs at 5V, and look in it's datasheet and it will have all the info about how to do it.
<br />
<br />On Squeedo I just run some code in RAM that does it (since the ROM becomes inaccessable in command mode).

<br />It's the fist time I heard it in that sense. Overall, is there a list of advantage and disadventages of each one ? I didn't see EPROM more than 2MBytes (16 MBits) and EEPROMS more than 32 kilobytes (256 KBits) the last time I checked it, but I may checked it badly or larger size may be uncommon.
