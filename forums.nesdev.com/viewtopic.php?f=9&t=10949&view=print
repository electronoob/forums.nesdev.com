		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello! I'm new around here, so sorry if this has been answered already (I did take a minute to search but couldn't find it).<br /><br />I'm interested in modifying a toaster style NES so that it's no longer required to hold reset while you press power on games that feature saving (like Zelda). What I've found on the topic says:<br /><ul>  <li> The toploader NES didn't need you to do this. Can anyone confirm?<br />  </li><li> Some newer cartridges didn't need this, even though the games might still suggest that you do it. Can anyone confirm?<br />  </li><li> The lose of saves is caused by power spikes. The solution (holding reset) works because reset disables the power to the cartridge, thus avoiding a spike. Can anyone confirm?</li></ul><br />So, my idea is to somehow modify the power button so that it asserts the RESET signal before (and while) it cuts the power. I'm pretty new to electronics and soldering, but I have some experience and access to tools. My training is primarily in software.<br /><br />Does anyone know how nintendo worked around it with the toploader NES?<br /><br />Thank you in advance!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If &quot;The toploader NES didn't need you to do this&quot; is true, there's only three possible reasons:<br /><br />1- The toploader has no CIC, so there's no possibility of repeatedly rebooting the game and having it write stuff into save memory, confusing the game.<br />or<br />2- The toploader has a less lousy cartridge connector, so there's no possibility of random lines being connected to random other lines and writing stuff into save memory.<br />or<br />3- The toploader has a significantly better power supply design, with larger and lower-ESR capacitors for all the ICs. But this feels unlikely; my NES-001 has a 10nF ceramic capacitor for every IC.<br /><br />Either way, simply automating the process of holding down reset won't solve it. Disabling the CIC would be a good first step.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">dagit wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The loss of saves is caused by power spikes. The solution (holding reset) works because reset disables the power to the cartridge, thus avoiding a spike. Can anyone confirm?<br /></div>That, on the other hand, is utter nonsense. The cartridge is powered whenever the NES is, and vice versa.<br />The only possible reason that holding the reset button has any effect is that it keeps the CPU from doing anything.

Again, I'm not all that knowledgable when it comes to electrical engineering. FWIW, I do plan to disable the CIC.<br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">That, on the other hand, is utter nonsense. The cartridge is powered whenever the NES is, and vice versa.<br />The only possible reason that holding the reset button has any effect is that it keeps the CPU from doing anything.</div><br />Hmm...So I decided to google a bit more.  I found this: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://board.zsnes.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=28592#p28592">http://board.zsnes.com/phpBB3/viewtopic ... 592#p28592</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I would describe that as a more detailed explanation of what you're saying. Low voltage =&gt; spastic CPU and holding reset keeps the CPU in a known state where it won't attempt any &quot;spastic&quot; reads/writes to the save data on the cartridge.<br /><br />So then, it seems to me that if holding the reset button forces the CPU into a known state that we should be able to simulate that by asserting the reset signal before and during the power off. I'm assuming that you'd need to start sending the reset signal before the voltage starts to drop. I'm not sure how long that needs to be, but I'm hoping it's just several milliseconds at most. I would assume the amount of time is determined by how many cycles it takes for the 6502 to go into the reset state.

Maybe you could add a brownout circuit that held the CPU in reset if the supply voltage got even a little below normal. If you really wanted to get fancy, you could totally decouple power control from the front switch and have a controller that did the proper sequence behind the scenes (very quickly so you wouldn't even notice it working differently).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've spent a lot of time trying to corrupt saves by power cycling.  The only time I was ever able to was when tapping the power button repeatedly, leaving the NES on for just the right amount of a split second.<br /><br />IMO, if you rely on statistics solely, you can get by with never using reset button.  Just don't attack the power switch like a woodpecker.  My naive 10yr old self never bothered with the reset button. and I don't recall shedding tears about losing a save.  Although I did own a toploader which is apparently better for some reason???<br /><br />In reality, you're only going to decrease your chances of losing a save.  The only way to mitigate losing it is backing it up.  That and you have to account for the power going out/removed from the NES during play.  That's going to be pretty tough to prevent completely without modification of the cartridge.  Not to mention the battery has a limited lifespan.<br /><br />I will say though, that I've have heard stories of others easily loosing saves.  I'd wonder how many of them were while using large flash carts like the powerpak though.

I've kept my saves countless times without holding the RESET button, and I've lost my saves countless times, even by holding the RESET button. In fact I don't know if there is a proofed correlation between how you loose your saves and the RESET button.<br />The problem is that if there is bad contact and you power the system up, the CPU can get in an known state and write stuff to $6000-$7fff, because you powered ON the system, without holding RESET.<br /><br />I've lost my save so numerous times it's hard to tell. Especially on NES and GBA, but also on SNES and GB(C), but much less frequently.

It might be why alot of people lost saves in the past. I too never held reset and don't ever remember losing save data. But I understand the theory behind holding reset.

Or the console lost power?<br /><br />That's kinda my point, you are still subject to these types of faults even if you make some sort of circuit interlock with the power and reset switch.  Pressing the power button without the reset button isn't the only way to loose saves, as your case points out.
