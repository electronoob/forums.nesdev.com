		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I finally got 3 of the the SX-Flash PCB I deisnged ! I did that mainly for fun and practice, to see how well it would turn. I started it at scool with a help of a professor.
<br />I don't have all componant for it yet, so I don't know how well it will work, but at least it is like I expected it to be and it fits in a cartridge case, which is a great joy to me !
<br />The board is not compatible with any Nintendo made board (else there would be no point in making it), but it allows to do test with a lot of SRAM without buying a game with rare MMC1 variants in it. That's where the name comes from, it's derived from SXROM, but uses a flash ROM instead.
<br />
<br />Compatible with UxROM. Compatible with minor hacks with AxROM and BNROM. Compatible with hacks with SNROM, SOROM and SXROM, under the condition that only one mirroring is used per programm. 
<br />
<br />SX-FLASH mapper :
<br />128kb, 256kb or 512kb of FlashROM at $8000-$ffff (bankswitched)
<br />8kb of CHRRAM at PPU $0000-$1fff
<br />32kb of battery backed WRAM (the chip is surface mounted on the bottom of the PCB to save space) at $6000-$7fff (bankswitched)
<br />
<br />Mirroring : Horizontal, vertical, and single-screen available with solder pads
<br />Two PRG bankswitching, 32kb and 16kb available with solder pads
<br />No bus conflicts.
<br />No CIC on the board.
<br />Board is standard 1.5-mm thick instead of 1.2mm as true NES games are (the factory I used didn't allow to change the thickness)

<br />Edit: 
<br />
<br />It's it possible to bank switch 8k bank only?  Can you bank switch some banks in the CHR-RAM? I saw some mapper doing this, maybe konami, I forgot.  Just curious.

<br />
<br />Yeah you can, if there were any bits left in the registers that'd be a good way to use them.  2 bits would do 32kB.  Plus, you can't really find 8kB SRAM chips anymore.
<br />
<br />My Squeedo cart has 32kB CHR-RAM, with the bank select being disabled when it accesses nametables, so you can use all 4 screens (leaving 28kB for tiles).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, it only uses standard chips (I don't have 100k$ for making custom chips, nor the knownledge).
<br />The mapper works as I've posted it, there is no additional features I haven't mentionned. I couldn't get anything more complicated to fit in a case with only 74 series chips easily, some programmable logic would have been needed, and this imply complicated things I'm unable to do.
<br />There is :
<br />- 2x 74HC161 for latching 4 bits (one for $8000-$bfff, the other for $c000-$ffff)
<br />- 1x 74HC139 to decode adress for both register and to remove bus conflicts
<br />- 1x 74HC08 to decode CE of the SRAM
<br />- 1x 74S04 to turn CE to /CE, and with battery backed security.
<br />- 1x 74HC32 to optionally fix the last bank into $c000-$ffff like UNROM does.
<br />
<br />I guess a famicom verion would be possible but you'd have to reverse-engineer the dimention of all famicom boards. There is a square hole, which is not something easy to do, as opposed to circular holes. Anyway, I don't know if they'll work at all for now. I just figured out that thickness will be more an issue that what I was hoping. I won't be able to get all the componants to make one until during next week.

<br />
<br />This comment will be off-topic so you should split that thread.  What is the advantage of being able to bank switch CHR-RAM?  If you only have 8k of it, I don't see any advantage. If you had more, it's a different story I guess.

<br />Sure would be, you could even mod a board with 1K ROM switching to do that. Hell, it'd be possible to do 16 byte bankswitching ;)

<br />
<br />Would you mean something like being able to map CHR-RAM to both CPU space and PPU space? Like having 2 or 4 8K chips you could map to either place? Or just a plain 32K of chr ram?

<br />
<br />Anyways, basically what I'm trying to say is if you had something like one chip with 32k of CHR RAM, that would be 4 8k CHR RAM banks. You could turn the screen completely off, and draw data in each of those banks. Then you would have 4 banks that you could switch around with to make instant graphical updates like you can with CHR ROM, basically giving CHR RAM the major advantage that CHR ROM has. Does that make sense?

<br />
<br />So basically "CNRAM"? Early Game Doctor hardware does exactly that, but at 8K banks it still not very handy. I say make the most of it with 1K/2K banks, all you need to do is rewire a MMC3 CHR ROM cart for a 62256, then you can have 6 separate 4 frame animations simultaneously.
