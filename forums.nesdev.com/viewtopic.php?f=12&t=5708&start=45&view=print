<br />
<br />The largest card would be 2^28 sectors * 512 bytes, or 128GB, which doesn't exist yet  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  That is a limit of the CF spec I used at the time which may be old now.  I have used 16GB regularly with both NES and SNES PowerPaks with no problems.  That is ~11000 games.

<br />Even if support was added via the FPGA for only one additional DSP chip, it would be a first for SNES backup devices.  Once support is added for a single DSP chip, the rest of the DSP chips would quickly follow.

I've noticed with my Action Replay MK3 trying to play my US Mega Man X2 and X3 carts on my Super Famicom has slight glitches every now and then (being every few seconds) but the game still runs. I first assumed it was dirty connectors but everything was very clean and further cleaning didn't help at all.

<br />I wouldn't skip this version, as there are many better SNES games than N64 and I think just about anyone would agree with that. N64 really only had a small handful of games and for me, I can count all the N64 games that I like on one hand.

<br />Another thing. I have a NTSC Snes modded to be region free. Will a power pak with a NTSC Lockout chip work on it or do I have to order a power pak with no lockout chip?

<br />
<br />It would require more than one hand for me to count the n64 games I like, also n64 emulation is terrible where SNES is pretty dam near perfect also I'm growing accustomed to using higher quality filters with SNES so I'm starting to prefer the emulators .

<br />
<br />Without those horrible people whose only goal in life is to steal from Nintendo, this system wouldn't be available for homebrewers or reverse engineers.  The sad day would be if any development hardware was cancelled because it could be used with illegal ROMs.
