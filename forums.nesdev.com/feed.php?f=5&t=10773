Yeah, I know about the Grim Reaper. I reached him exactly once and he killed me in a bunch of seconds. (With the PRG0 version some weeks ago. Unfortunately, the game crashed shortly afterwards, so I wasn't able to reach him a second time.) So yeah, I had already managed to defeat Frankenstein once in the past. This time, I had him down to one hitpoint in two different occasions, but I never made it.<br /><br />One thing I don't understand: While the Grim Reaper is the hardest opponent in the game, people also bitch about Dracula's first form. But I have absolutely no problems with it. While I haven't reached him on the actual console, I can defeat him even with the keyboard when I play the game on an emulator. So, what's so frustrating about him? Don't stop moving when he has teleported away and he won't be able to appear right inside you.<br /><br /><br />If the game crashes due to a PRG bus problem, what does the screen look like in this case? Simply the current scene as a still image?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6156">DRW</a> — Mon Jun 09, 2014 2:24 pm</p><hr />

To be honest I can't say if this was a connector problem or a softare problem and there's no way to tell since we can't &quot;peek&quot; into your NES to know what has happened.<br /><br />CHR-bus problem -&gt; Garbled graphics<br />PRG-bus problem -&gt; Crash<br />CIC-bus problem -&gt; Goes into &quot;reset blinking&quot; mode (only if CIC is not disabled)<br /><br />The 72-pin connector just is horrible. I have only had trouble with it. However it doesn't mean it is the source of your crash, I just point out it could have been.<br /><br />If you think Frankenstein is hard then wait until the corridor before Grim Reaper and Grim Reaper itself, it's totally impossible. Never managed to pass this one without cheating somehow.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Jun 09, 2014 1:58 pm</p><hr />

The only situation where this might happen is if the console is bumped by something, but in this case, it goes into reset mode or something similar.<br />Apart from &quot;Castlevania&quot;, I've never had a situation where the console wasn't moved a single millimeter, where the game worked fine for 30 minutes and where the crash simply froze the scene (plus a bunch of errors in the status bar) and you could see the still image.<br />And given that the other version of &quot;Castlevania&quot; does the exact same thing, I assume that this is just another programming glitch.<br />The question is: How high is the chance that this glitch appears during gameplay? The game is difficult enough, even without it forcing you to restart after you have tried to defeat Frankenstein 10 times now with the Grim Reaper still ahead.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />(off topic <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Also you didn't have to import a cart from USA, a PAL Castlevania cart works better on a NTSC console, as the music or gameplay speed wasn't adapted to PAL.

Since I'm playing the game on an original NTSC NES (even though I'm from Germany, I bought the American NES), I doubt that it has anything to do with the hardware. So, yeah, it has to be an undiscovered bug. Does anybody know more?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6156">DRW</a> — Mon Jun 09, 2014 1:05 pm</p><hr />

Well back when I used to play PAL NES hardware with the ZIF 72-pin connector, having a game crash because of the connector wasn't all that uncommon. With emulators and an imported Famicom, this doesn't happen any more. However, it might also have been a rare soft bug that wasn't fixed in PRG1, with an interrupt race condition or something.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Jun 09, 2014 12:28 pm</p><hr />

O.k., yesterday, I played &quot;Castlevania (U) (PRG1)&quot; and guess what: It crashed as well. Not on the floor with the Grim Reaper, but when I went through the door that leads you to that small floor right before Frankenstein.<br /><br />It is definitely version PRG1. I know it because I opened the cartridge and checked it: &quot;NES-CV-1 PRG&quot; is written on the chip.<br /><br />So, what's with this bug? I always read that the bug from PRG0 was fixed in PRG1, but the game still crashes. How come that this specific crash isn't mentioned anywhere? Or is it a completely unrelated issue?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6156">DRW</a> — Mon Jun 09, 2014 11:48 am</p><hr />
