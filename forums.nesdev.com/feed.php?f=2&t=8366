This can also be done by using a higher priority sprite with the "behind BG" flag set and having the shape you want to give to the BG. Castlevania uses this for the door entrance, SMB3 uses it for pipes (instead of simply making Mario "behind BG" like SMB1 does).<br /><br />This priority could also be done in my demo by placing the hero's sprite "behind BG", which would have no effect as the BG is transparent where the sprite is, but then alter the logic so that the player shadow is NOT masked where you want the player to be masked. The player would still be visible through the BG color as he's literally "behind BG".<br /><br />Of course it would require adding some more complex logic where it's already quite complex.<br />If you simply want to hide the player behind some tiles and not some others though it's as simple as not uploading the name table with the special tiles, but you're limited to square tile-aligned shapes.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Jan 03, 2012 7:42 am</p><hr />

The Mega Man series and Super Mario Bros. 2 USA (for Mario and Princess) used a sprite overlay trick to create characters of more than 3 colors.<br />In case of Mega Man, the face is a distinct white-yellow sprite that is overlayed on the blue-cyan-black body, and in case of Mario and Princess, the eyes were overlayed over the character's non-hollow face. (Why they did not use it for Luigi and Toad, I don't know.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5043">Bisqwit</a> — Sun Jan 01, 2012 4:24 pm</p><hr />

Nice demo! It's quite a good example of where this technique could be useful in software. Although Jut Breed did manage to have colorful characters even without it, if you disregard all the reddish enemies :)<br /><br />Another type of AND mask that comes to mind is to support sprites being partially by BG without requiring a one color background such as is the case for sprite priority. This is sort of the opposite of the technique discussed in this thread, as you modify the sprite CHR based on the BG it intersects. <br /><br />Solstice is a nice example of doing this trick in software. But the fact that it runs in a small part of the screen with the rest of the screen blanked may be related to all the CHR-RAM updates it needs to do to pull this off...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=106">Bananmos</a> — Sun Jan 01, 2012 1:17 pm</p><hr />

I just bump to say I'm working on the proof of concept, don't you guys think I've given up.<br /><br />However it ended up a bit more complicated than I expected to generate the nametable updates. I now did a program that follows the player by animating NT and PT updates, so all's left is programming the dynamic "AND" mask. Unfortunately I have a lot of work in real life so I'm not sure if I'll be able to end this demo before Christmas, but I'll try my best.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Dec 20, 2011 3:23 pm</p><hr />

Well now I trought a bit more about this trick, and I think it's not that stupid to consider doing it in software when you use CHR RAM.<br /><br />For example in a RPG with all 16x16 sprites, you could use this trick on the hero, it's arguable the look of the hero is more important than the look of other stuff so you want him to have one more color while still having a black outline.<br />If you scroll only in one direction at a time, you just have to reserve a total of 6 tiles for this and dynamically upload them every frame when the player is moving, which is doable with some unrolled loop. You'll also have to upload four nametable bytes every 8 pixels of scrolling (in addition to the normal updates).<br />So yes this is quite a few updates, but you can use one more color on the hero while still having 3 NPCs on the same line without flickering, while using a 2-layered hero would only allow 2 NPCs on the line, 3 will flicker. Also you'd have to store both layers in CHR RAM while here you only reserve 6 background tiles for that effect.<br /><br />In games with bigger sprites which does multi directional scrolling, it's probably not worth the trouble as it would require way too much updates on both name tables and pattern tables for only one more color while multilayering allows 2/3 more colors (typically 2 as you'd have a black color common in all palettes for outlines - but not compularly).<br /><br />So this sounds like a decent idea for RPGs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Dec 12, 2011 12:31 pm</p><hr />

Sooooo,<br />Doing it with CHR-RAM + software mapping would work but be really slow to upload, it might work if done only on the hero's sprite and if this sprite is fairly small (something like 16x16) so you have at worse something like 6 tiles to upload, so why not. One more color can be very significant, and doing it with two-layered sprites will eat some of the precious 8 sprites per scanline.<br /><br />Doing it with a chip sounds nice, but the chip would have to be complicated. In addition to the normal CHR ROM/RAM, an additional layer of CHR-ROM/RAM of at least 1BP should be present in the mapper, and the mapper should be able to logically AND the normal BG with it's internal "sprite shadow rednering" as Bananmos said.<br />While you're doing something as complex, why not extend it to more BP so you can allow other BG colors to be used in your sprites too ? That way you could get for example if you have one color in common in all BG palettes, 5 color sprites (transparent color + shared color + normal 3) without eating some of the precious 8 sprites per limitation.<br />However, again this would require a crazy complex FPGA based mapper.<br /><br /><br />For really large sprites (probably more than 24x24), it's possible to do this for the middle of the sprite manually, by just using solid colors on the nametable and change them as the player advances, this way the transparent color in the middle of the sprites becomes this "solid" color, while the transparent colors of the border of the sprites are really transparent.<br />I think this is common on some older computers, but on the NES it's not practical due to the 16x16 attribute limitation, so I guess again a shared color between all the palettes is more suitable for this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Dec 01, 2011 10:09 am</p><hr />
