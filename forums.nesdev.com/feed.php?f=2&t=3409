Kind of like how people using an MCU for bit-banged RS232 would sometimes use a clock that gives a whole number of CPU cycles for each bit that comes in.  That would practically eliminate framing errors, plus make the code a cinch to write.<br /><br />I'm also thinking, with the way oscillators start up (varying with temperature and such, even more with a PLL) they won't start on the same cycle.  I guess if it's fast enough it'd be able to get an input from the NES and go from there though.  And also that 2 different oscillators will drift apart from eachother over some period of time.  Maybe not a problem again, for the same reason (great speed difference and waiting for NES input).<br /><br />I had thought about trying a similar experiment on Squeedo, for doing something like "fast block transfers" (forgoing IRQs on both CPUs) where the NES could just read/write as fast as possible while the PIC struggles to keep up and not drift into timing errors.  I never got around to doing that though.<br /><br />It does sound like a good idea. The designers at 6502.org have the luxury of clocking the CPU with their microcontroller, though.  Sure is easy when you can just change everything around. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Jun 15, 2007 7:06 pm</p><hr />

It could be nice if a microcontroller could be synced with the NES CPU.  I'm definitely not an oscillator expert, but I'm kinda skeptical that a PLL on the M2 clock at such high speeds would be practical.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Jun 15, 2007 3:53 pm</p><hr />

Hey, sorry, I just missed that quote.<br />I think a x32 PLL multiplier on the M2 line would allow the microcontroller to run at 57.8 kHz on NTSC and 52 kHz on PAL, wich would be somewhat great.

Just to keep lazy people rest lazy and just do some register writes instead of doing actual coding. Features like A/D converters and such cannot be replaced with soft, tough (but couldn't be interesting to use as mapper).<br />Anyway even if such a micro would be used, some features, like mirroring control and bus conflicts disabling couldn't be done without some discrete logic arround, because the mappers output really needs to directly react to the inputs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Jun 15, 2007 1:53 pm</p><hr />

MMCs are standard setup for the NES, so it definitely make sense to continue to use standard setups, and avoid complications, such as making super-bizare mappers made up just to have the desired features while being cheaper.<br />Plain discrete logic can still do great stuff, the only real problem is that features will eventually grow up a enourmous number of chips, and that it's a bit hazardous to route. (but nothing beats quad SMD chips when it comes to be horrible to route).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Jun 15, 2007 8:19 am</p><hr />

CPLDs are quite expensive when you want MMC3 functionality or beyond. TTL logic is equally expensive when getting complex, and akward to route. Full-custom ASICs are inexpensive to produce in larger quantaties, but it will cost you a fortune to setup manufacturing of them. And unless you have prior experience in ASIC design, something is likely to make the ASIC screw up in the first run.<br /><br />For a really powerful mapper at an "acceptable" price tag, I think something like the flash-based ProASIC FPGA would do. It has the traditional drawbacks of not being 5V tolerant though, and you won't get below $10 a piece even for larger quantities.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=106">Bananmos</a> — Thu Jun 14, 2007 12:02 pm</p><hr />

I'm pretty sure I could even come up with a fairly cheap way to do a scanline or CPU cycle timer interrupt.  If it's really needed, I may be able to source some 74LS670s so both banks could be independently switched (but I might face a minimum order, so I'd have to be confident the game can use it with good success).<br /><br />I'm still willing to offer my new board design service for free (well, at my cost.. $100).
