Now that I think of it, try desoldering pin 22 from one of the connectors.  That'd be a good place to start.  It's an address input to the NES's internal VRAM.  Some carts will connect it directly to either PPU-A10 or PPU-A11 (to select the mirroring mode).  Others, like SMB3, can control what it's connected to through software with it's mapper.  It's almost certain there'll be a conflict there.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Dec 11, 2006 5:36 am</p><hr />

havent tried that at all in fact im very new to this only started researching and doing anything about a month ago. im never scared to start on a project without any knowledge in it lol but i have no clue what ce is but i did manage to find this out i took another fried cart (from handling) and used my ohm meter to find where the traces were redundat from the electrolytic cap on the cart and found it was feeding more than 10 diff pins all over. i thought maybe if i were to remove the cap and plug it in and see if it is still interfering. maybe put some diodes on the ground pins and such. the best way is probably to leave both carts in with it powered on and desolder one wire at a time to see whats interfering<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1795">tomass</a> — Sun Dec 10, 2006 11:33 pm</p><hr />

Ok so i know this is an old thread but i want to bring life back into it with a new project i have embarked on and to now have yet to fail but yeaterday i hit a critical point int he project where i needed to get to a point to find out if my theory was correct and of course it was not so now im stuck. <br /><br />I started with my old nes dissasembled and some 24 gauge copper wire<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/01.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/07.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/08.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />next i took my power/reset board and examined it to see what i needed to do <br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/02.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />i decided i wanted to have a remote power/reset button and other features.<br />so i soldered 4 wires 2 to each switch for now<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/05.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />since i am going to be porting out about 10-20 wires i decided to use an already implemented connection. I used a parallel printer cable jack. I wanted it in the front of the nes but not over the buttons or the controller ports so it had to go in the center but its length would not fit because of the center peg for the bottom screw holding the top on. not wanting to hurt the integrity of the case i opted to turn the jack sideways.<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/03.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/04.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />this next image shows everything in place with connections made<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/06.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />next i decided to diable the lockout chip. i was originally going to connect pin 4 of the cic lockout chip to a ground but in desoldering it i broke it off which is ok unless you plan to play gold games such as zelda whcih i just have hated all my life with a passion and i dont know why.<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/10.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/09.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />your soldering iron is the best friend in a project like this so invest in something that will be with you in the long run i use a digital soldering station with ground termination for the equipment your working on you know you dont want to kill any components. components run at minimal voltage &lt;6volts and any static can damage IC's and other parts.<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/11.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />after a while your sponge may become lost or too dirty then i would suggest buying some o-cello sponges from your local dollar store and cut one to fit your tray<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/12.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />my extra hands help out in some situations<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/15.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />my fan helps suck the dangerous fumes away when soldering<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/16.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />there are alot of wires your dealing with here so pay attention and dont mix them up. remeber 72 pins minus the expansion ports leaves alot of wires. the wire im using was a bulk phone company wire with 50 wires inside so chopped off two 2 foot sections and used them. as for the soldering you get the idea in the next few pictures<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/14.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/18.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/19.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/20.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />now i was planning on soldering 8 connectors to the main feed so about 65 wires in a series all connected except for pin 36 which is +5v for the nes cart. my theory was that cutting power would stop interferences from the other game carts. well i had to get the main connector and two more connectors on in order to test this. once i was done i tested it.<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/21.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/22.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/23.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />so i power on my nes with mario bros 3 and donkey kong plugged in power only to mario and it looks fine at first but notice the bottom of the screen there are a series of m's and other characters<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/24.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />then when the title screen shows up its all messed up<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/25.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />so i power off remove donkey kong and power back on and voila its back to normal<br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/26.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.twistedfantasies.com/NES/27.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />so i dont know what to do next in my quest to run 8 games in a solely hardware switched system<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1795">tomass</a> — Sun Dec 10, 2006 10:02 pm</p><hr />

Also, I can't find any distributors for that part anyway - I put in an inquiry for a discrete order just for grins.<br /><br />Somehow, cutting down replacement toaster-NES connectors seems like the only way forward, as was mentioned... elsewhere (can't remember where though)*.<br /><br />*Edit: it was here, see post below.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=273">pragma</a> — Wed Mar 01, 2006 11:57 am</p><hr />

Look for some of my old topics if you want details on the fiasco I had getting 72 pin connectors.  I have resorted to buying the "U" shaped replacement connectors off ebay, and doing some serious re-work on them with a Dremel.  This produces a very usable connector, but is a lot of work, and mechanically not as nice as a vertically mounted card edge connector would be.  If only I could figure out where the clone makers like Messiah get their parts.  A call to their office revealed that they have no idea... the device is designed and manufactured in Asia, the guys in LA know almost nothing about it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29">teaguecl</a> — Wed Mar 01, 2006 11:47 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Memblers wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I had an idea for something like this a while back, just imagining though.  I don't know how much the connectors would cost, probably too much since it's a custom type.<br /></div><br /><br />I did my homework on this.

The price could be lower, but its worth not having to hack ISA or Floppy connectors all afternoon.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Then I figure a lot of bus driver chips.<br /></div><br /><br />Here's where I'm out of my depth; If you could kindly fill me in (or point me to a good tutorial as I'd like to learn more), I'd appreciate it.   <br /><br />I figured that there might be some problems with capacitance, resistance, or something else with all that unpowered circuitry hanging off of the cartridge lines - but I'm just not educated enough to know for sure.<br /><br />Also, I noticed in the pictures on the sites I posted at the top of this thread, that there was a ceramic cap for each set of chips on the 'massive multicart board'.  Do you think that was being done to filter out irregularities in the power (between+5V and GND), or something else?  Would that be something to bring into this design as well?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Maybe I'm just crazy, but I'd want the thing fully powered (externally) and possibly under control so the program could select any cart whenever it wants.  That'd be a hell of a hardware expansion usable by whatever fits in the NES's internal 2kB of RAM (well, depending on what carts are connected anyways, getting to be like a PC with infinite hardware configs).<br /></div><br /><br />Interesting idea.  How would you insert the active cart-switching software into the works without it tripping all over what games are plugged in?<br /><br />I can see the value in external power, but only if you were powering all the cartridges at once.  Once you've done that, all the chips in every cart could/would respond to activity on the address and data lines, so you'd have to effectively route/switch each cartridge independently.  That would make for one hell of a soldering job.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Also, with just cutting off the power of a cart to disable it (or just ICs in general), is that safe to do electrically?  I was wondering about that for some other designs.  Since the inputs would be getting voltage while VCC and GND are both 0V, a lot of chips will say things like max VCC+0.6V.  It makes the voltage difference sound unsafe, but I don't know.<br /></div><br /><br />Oh, I see: logic typically runs closer to +1.0V, so that's almost double what the rated input would be.  I was hoping that as long as the chips in question had a proper ground, it could tolerate the situation.   <br /><br />And I suppose under-running all the 'dormant' games at VCC+0.5V, or reducing logic to the same would be just as bad.  So using active logic for *each cart* might be the only way to go - so much for keeping it simple. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Given that probably nobody reading this has access to an M82 demo unit, does anyone here know how the Game Genie handles this for one cartridge?  (I'd dismantle one myself if I owned one)<br /><br />Edit: fixed link and spelling.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=273">pragma</a> — Wed Mar 01, 2006 8:19 am</p><hr />
