<br />Recca uses MMC3, just like Batman and Super Mario Bros 3.
<br />Crisis force uses Konami VRC4 as its mapper, a mapper roughly equivalent to MMC3 (but slightly better).
<br />
<br />You just seeing really good programming and game design here.  Neither of those two games even uses extra RAM in the cartridge.

Cartridges for the NES and other cartridge-based consoles from the Atari 2600 through the Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Advance contain ROM that's as fast as RAM. The Nintendo DS, DSi, 3DS, and PSVita, on the other hand, treat their ROM cartridges as a <a href="http://www.pocketheaven.com/ph/wiki/Block_device" class="postlink">really fast disk</a>, not unlike CompactFlash, and have to copy everything to RAM in order to run it. This is why the SuperCard for GBA and PowerPak for NES have the "loading" phase: they're copying data from the CF to a big ass RAM on the cartridge that the console thinks is ROM.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Because there are systems with 640 KB RAM that still don't do what NES is capable of.</div>
<br />You say "640 KB RAM", so I guess you're referring to old PCs running MS-DOS in real mode, which are famous for having a 20-bit address space with RAM in the lower 640 KiB. The amount of main memory is comparable between the PC and NES, given that <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Myths#Largest_game" class="postlink">only a handful</a> of original games for NES and Famicom are over 512 KiB of ROM: Kirby's Adventure, Metal Slader Glory, and a couple that don't come to my mind immediately. The biggest difference I can see is that the PC's multicolor display modes are a dumb frame buffer; the NES PPU just does a lot more.

<br />Despite being poor game, it uses W-RAM.For a simple game like that using W-RAM is...a Big(With capital B) waste.I can bet that some of nesdev programmers(maybe even me..) could make this game with UNROM, and no W-RAM(UNROM have no W-RAM anyway..).

<br />I seem to remember marketing claiming that the big advantage of Home Alone over, say, Lode Runner is that the Wet Bandits would learn the player's patterns.
<br />
<br />As for whether pre-486 PCs had shooters like this: I don't think they could handle raster effects.

Only 386-486 with VGA got enough power to do it well, more or less.

<br />Basically, an Amiga fanboy who trashes NES by "zomg 2 KB RAM". So? N64 has just 4 MB RAM, and runs games that require 64 MB on a PC.

The memory just happens to be read-only.  It's not just a matter of there being 'no loading times', but there is simply stuff one can do with 512kB of memory that can't be done in 64kB, whether it's ROM or RAM.
<br />
<br />Check out this port of Prince of Persia to C64 (released a couple months ago) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBs5-WOtIpc" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBs5-WOtIpc</a>
<br />It uses a ROM cartridge.  I'm not certain, but I imagine this (with all those animations) would just not be possible without a large memory.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Following the same reasoning, you'd say the SNES has more memory than the Playstation, as the latter SNES carts were often 4MB but the Playstation only have 2MB of system RAM.
<br />
<br />The reality is more complex.
<br />To compare what is comparable, let's compare the FDS to regular cartridges. The FDS has 34kb of RAM while a cartridge hooked up to a NES has only (natively) 2kb if no SRAM is present on the cart. The FDS is not supperior as it can only "see" small parts of the discs loaded in memory at once - while a cartridge can acess any data anytime.
<br />
<br />However in a typical game you only access one music at a time, one level at a time, one character set at a time etc... So the real difference is in loading times.
<br />
<br />The C64 definitely has less graphics possibilities than the NES through - and only have 3 sound channels - even if they feature much more than the NES' channels.
<br />
<br />Another thing to take into consideration is that VRAM on the C64 is just part of its RAM - so all the part you use for storing graphics and sprites is taken and can't be used for anything else. This is also why the C64's CPU is so slow - because the RAM access are interleaved between the video chip and the 6510 - so both have to run two times slower than the RAM's speed which is pretty terrible.

<br />Agreed. Put VRAM on a separate bus, use a Z80, and cheap out on the audio, and you get the MSX (if programs are in RAM). Move the programs to ROM, and you get the ColecoVision. Add scrolling to the ColecoVision and take out the attribute clash and you have the SMS, which is graphically roughly comparable to an NES with CHR RAM.

<br />Although the greater bit depth of the SMS makes a huge difference in my opinion. Some SMS games look amazing (they don't necessarily play well though), with graphics that the NES could never come close to reproducing.
