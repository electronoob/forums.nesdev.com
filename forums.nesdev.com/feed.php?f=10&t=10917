I don't think  I am up to the challenge of a platform game or anything like that. Plus I am more interested in an abstract experience (where it might not be obvious what interactions will have which effects, and the graphics would be more like patterns or randomness). Have there been any homebrew games that take this approach? Where there is no real point to the game, you just interact with the audio and visual content?<br /><br />Also, if any programmers are interested in this type of interactive/generative gaming experience, I will likely need to pull a team together to get anywhere with this. I assume it would be easier to develop than most games in some respects, even while presenting its own challenges. Like I mentioned, it also doesn't have to be completely stable. Glitches and bugs would be considered par for the course (just as in stochastic and generative music). <br /><br />I am currently focusing on learning about the art and sound design aspects of the NES, it would be cool to find someone locally (or, if feasible, someone over the net) that already has experience with programming and knows about existing engines and such that could be utilized.

Maybe as I get better at the art and sound aspect I could exchange those skills with a programmer for his/her own skills. <br /><br />As an aside, I just started a new blog series on stochastic art and this weekend's post will feature NES emulated sounds (from a free plug-in). It is an aleatoric piece (my kids rolled dice to determine which phrases go where, and what harmonies exist in the chords). I'll post a link when I put it up so you can check out the kind of work I do (the previous entry was a tutorial on <a href="http://rickpeden.com/stochastic-art-series/" class="postlink">glitch art</a>).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6355">RYQ</a> — Thu Jan 23, 2014 12:21 pm</p><hr />

You could do something like a platform game where player A controls movement and player B controls the weapon, or you could even AND both player's controls together (so the game only counts a button as pressed while both players are pressing it) and mount the controllers more than 8 feet apart, so one person can't play the game alone. The game should also require movement in four directions so it's impossible to play by just taping down buttons on one controller.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4844">Grapeshot</a> — Wed Jan 22, 2014 4:36 pm</p><hr />

It will continue to say 1 until the player is no longer holding the button. So with the code you'd take the values from each controller and see if the bit is set for the appropriate button on both.

It seems this could be a way to avoid syncing buttons precisely. <br /><br />Or, perhaps there could be a clock that players can use as a metronome (something simple, just stepping through 4 &quot;beats&quot; or something). Or even a combination of these methods for either short-time &quot;quantizing&quot; between the not-so-exactly-synced incoming controller data; or, just have a clock running through some parameters or tables of variables during which button interaction would make different changes dependent on &quot;clock&quot; cycle. Button presses wouldn't have to be synced in the former or latter, since behavior would either be quantized in the former, or progressively generative in the latter from the &quot;hold&quot; function over longer periods of time.<br /><br />I mentioned intentional glitches because I have worked with databending and glitch art in the past. So, the end result of what I am trying to do here could exploit known failures of the NES (too many sprites on a line, game lag, etc) instead of avoiding it. In fact, if the users could eventually cause the system to crash and need to be reset through their combined actions, I would see this as a bonus.

As you know, the NES defined what a video game system is for many people. For these people (myself and many friends included), sitting around the console with those controllers in our hands was essentially our generation's version of sitting around the neolithic fire. The nostalgia is visceral.  <br /><br />The NES is a massively important cultural artifact. It's an icon of the period. It was also instrumental in the cultural shift that changed the way we expect to interact with each other through technology. It wasn't the first of its kind, but in my mind it has been the most significant historically. <br /><br />Hopefully I can get some better ideas about the limitations and possibilities by discussing it with folks who understand it better than myself. I do have some more specific ideas, but I am just trying to find some examples of already existing games and find out about some limitations that I may not know about.<br /><br />Thanks for the response.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6355">RYQ</a> — Tue Jan 21, 2014 11:25 pm</p><hr />

Dian Shi Mali (the &quot;PUSH START TO RICH&quot; slot machine game) puts some bet buttons and the start button on the second controller because there aren't enough buttons on the first.<br /><br />Smash TV rotates both controllers 90 degrees to the right into the &quot;double fisted&quot; position, so that one Control Pad moves and the other fires.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Tue Jan 21, 2014 7:06 pm</p><hr />

Gyromite is sort of like that, where the second controller moves parts of the level, though ultimately you're supposed to control that via the first controller making the screen flash to tell the robot to press the second controller (instead of just putting those buttons on controller 1).<br /><br />Mega Man 3 lets you super-jump if you hold a button on controller 2, though this isn't really gameplay.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Tue Jan 21, 2014 6:29 pm</p><hr />
