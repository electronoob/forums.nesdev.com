		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello everyone, this my first post in this place and i hope which this is not the last and i can contribute to community too =)<br /><br />I am working in new CPU to my NES emulator, i am very novice on emulation and i had some doubt(i used nesdev wiki, this help much) and i finished the new CPU which i written in ARM Assembly, but there is some bugs in some games. So i used NEStres to check some problems and it give me these erros:<br /><br />ASL - Error in Z-Flag<br />ROL - Error in Z-Flag<br />ROR - Error in C-Flag<br /><br />ABSX - Error in Wrap<br />ABSY - Error in Wrap<br /><br /><br />The Flag is easy to fix(i think) but the problem now is with Absolute Y and Absolute X, these wrap, i checked many times and re-write many times the Addr of ABSX/ABSY and never change, someone can explain me more about it ? <br /><br />Regards =)

(In the background, the 6502 is adding the carry to $3F to produce $40.) </li><li>Notice there was a carry and try again reading $4007 </li></ol><br />Cycle 6 reads $3F07, which on the NES is a mirror of $2007, the PPU VRAM data port. This puts the current value in the VRAM read buffer on the CPU's data bus, reads from the current VRAM address, puts that in the read buffer, and adds 1 or 32 to the VRAM address.<br /><br />Cycle 7 reads $4007, which isn't connected to anything on the NES. (For writing, it's the square 1 high period, but it doesn't respond to reads.) This &quot;open bus&quot; situation means that the inherent capacitance of the data bus will cause the previous value to remain on the bus. And in this case, the previous value is that from $3F07 == $2007 == data read from VRAM.

One time from the unprocessed carry address and the other from the address after the carry has been processed? Is there a game that exploit this kind of behavior? I was thinking here and it is so strange to use such a thing (as a game dev and processors architect, not as the emulator dev).<br />What are the historical reasons of such behavior?

One time from the unprocessed carry address and the other from the address after the carry has been processed?<br /></div>Exactly. It doesn't have the time to add the carry to the MSB of the address during the same cycle that it's trying to read. It adds the carry to the MSB of the address during the 4th cycle while it's reading the data bus, and so it then reads from the correct address on the 5th cycle if necessary.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Is there a game that exploit this kind of behavior?<br /></div>I don't know of one on the NES ... but I bet some 2600 games use it at least for the timing variation.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What are the historical reasons of such behavior?<br /></div>The 6502 was designed to use a very small number of transistors. The additional complexity and cost of making that addition happen was deemed not worth it, at the time.
