		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've seen a lot of people making DEV carts here and it has me very interested, but I see everyone using eprom programmers to program flashroms and then insert them in socketed carts. I was wondering if anyone has made a cart with a built in flasher (serial/USB input or whatever) so the chips didnt have to be removed and inserted into a programmer, but could be programmed right on the board with a cable. I know the funkyflashcart does this, but my hopes of that comming out anytime soon are very low.
<br />
<br />I know memblers also made/is making a flashcart that can be programmed with the copynes, but thats not exactly what im looking for. Just to be able to plug a cable from a computer to a DEVcart and program it on the fly would be great.
<br />
<br />Thanks in advanced  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

I was supposed to have released it a long time ago, but my plans with the firmware were pretty ambitious so it hasn't been finished to my satisfaction (someone wrote that the complexity of embedded software grows to fill the available memory, it's damn true <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />).  Plus other real-life-based issues getting in the way, so I haven't been working on it non-stop.  All the firmware is updatable though.  The basic functionality is already there.
<br />
<br />I've built a couple, I can make a few more if anyone might want to buy one and be a guinea pig.  A while back I was meaning to post a thread on here looking for developers to work with it (especially anyone willing to work with the special features like the PIC as a coprocessor), but I kinda got sidetracked and forgot.
<br />
<br />The CopyNES reprogrammable cart is done too, ready to ship a good couple dozen of them, but the bad thing right now is that it's only supported in the DOS/Win9x version of the CopyNES client.  Well, and I need to design a cart label for it.  Then I can open my little online store thingy, heheheh.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is probably a really dumb question, but is it possible that you could solder wires from each pin of the EPROM/Flash chip, and put each end in the programmer, and program it like that? Here is a picture of what I'm trying to say:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.freewebs.com/the_bott/idea1.JPG" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />So you could have the chip soldered into the cart, and wires soldered to the ends of the pins sticking out of the cart, so you could just stick those in the programmer, and the programmer would read the chip through the wires! Is this possible? Or would it slow things down too much (with programming) and screw up the game?

<br />
<br />But I figured some of the rewiring could interfere with the programming. Such as pins that you tie to GND or +5V so they will not be left floating, but would have an actual function while in programming (Write Enable?)...
<br />
<br />I don't know. Haven't though about it a whole lot. It would be nice not have to plug and unplug the chip all the time, though.

<br />What does "left floating" mean? I've heard that term more than once, in another thread, and I thought it was just like "Not soldered to anything" or "A bent pin that's just sitting there".

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, it means exactly that. I said that because Flash ROMs have this WE (write enable) pin, wich has no use during play, but is tied to +5V (seemed to work for me) so it's not left floating. But it is necessasy during programming, and since it's tied to another used pin some kind of short-circuit could take place... I don't know...
<br />
<br />But what is the point of trying this with an EPROM, since it's not simply erasable...? This could be very useful for Flash, that can just be reprogrammed without even needing to be erased first.

<br />
<br />EDIT: A couple of terms, I want to know what they mean, and what effect they have:
<br />
<br />+5V - This is self-explanitory, right?
<br />GND - Ground, but what does that mean?
<br />Vcc
<br />Vpp
<br />
<br />I'm sorry, I just never knew what those really did, besides the +5V, I kinda know what that means. And a pin is called Axx. What's the difference between Axx and Dxx? What does the A in Axx stand for? Sorry if you can't answer all these questions at once, if you just linked me to something, that'd be good enough =).

<br />
<br />AFAIK, Vcc is the working voltage, the same as +5V, for the NES. Vpp is the programming voltage, used by EPROMs. I can't really describe what GND is. The "Axx" pins are the ADDRESS pins, one for each bit. And "Dxx" are the DATA pins, also one for each bit.

<br />+5v = positive 5 volts
<br />vcc = same as +5v for nes stuff
<br />vdd = same as +5v for nes stuff (from the old "drain")
<br />
<br />gnd = ground, 0 volts.  All voltages are measured relative to ground.
<br />vss = same as gnd (from the old "source")
<br />
<br />vpp = programming voltage, usually +5v or +12v.  Eproms usually need high voltage to set the fuses.  Your programmer will take care of all this.
<br />
<br />"left floating" = an unconnected wire.  Random background noise can cause the wire to "float" from high to low, sucking power and changing the circuit. This is why an unconnected input is a BAD idea.  Unconnected output is ok.
<br />
<br />Axx = address lines, A0 = least significant address bit
<br />Dxx = data lines, D0 = least significant data bit.  Hopefully you will only have D0-D7 because it is an 8 bit system...
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />Connecting power and ground is another BAD idea, so you will need some switches on the cart for the hardwired lines like /WE.  If the board has /WE connected to +5 and your programmer tries to connect it to gnd for writing, bad things will happen.  Bad may include broken programmer, fried mem chip, and releasing of the magic smoke.

<br />
<br />The flow problem goes back to Franklin naming stuff he didnt really understand yet.  "Current" flows from positive/vcc/vdd/+5 to negative/vss/gnd.  But the physical electrons are travelling the opposite direction, from gnd to vcc.  This is why vss (source) is at ground, it is the source of the electrons.  The electrons move from vss (source) to vdd (drain).  That confusion is part of why vss/vdd have mostly been replaced.  Not sure where vcc came from, probably something to do with collector voltage...

<br />
<br />VDD / VSS is typically used on circtits involving FET transistors. VDD is "Voltage Drain" and VSS "Voltage Source".
<br />Since FET transistors are more recent, normally VDD and VSS should be newer than VCC and VEE. However, I'm unsure, and the use of numbered voltage can be better (+5V is more meaningfull than VCC or VDD).

<br />also, how hard would it be to use usb2 and record the cart pin ?  so i could see what the game is actually doing ?
