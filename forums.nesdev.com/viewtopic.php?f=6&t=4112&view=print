		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This may belong in the noobie section, but I figured since it deals solely with music that it would be more fitting here.  Anyway...
<br />
<br />I'm trying to modify an NES emulator (can be any NES emu, basically, though I've been working mostly with Nestopia and FCEU) to play a set of preset MP3s in place of its normal sound routines, specifically for Mega Man 2.  I've already seen precedents of this sort of thing with Metal Mame (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://metalmame.megadriver.com.br/metalmame.cgi?pg=downloads">http://metalmame.megadriver.com.br/meta ... =downloads</a><!-- m -->) and a similar hack for snes9x (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.megadriver.com.br/sitev2.html">http://www.megadriver.com.br/sitev2.html</a><!-- m -->) but I don't know enough about the inner workings of MAME for the source to be helpful for anything more than a very general idea.
<br />
<br />Admittedly, I have virtually no experience with emulation (or Assembly, which unfortunately I'm going to need, aren't I...), but I have a fair amount of exposure to C/C++, but I'm just wondering a few things, and thought this would be the right place to ask.
<br />
<br />1. Am I in over my head or should this be relatively painless?  I've already toyed around with the FCEU source a bit, but I don't want to waste my time if it simply isn't reasonable.
<br />
<br />2. What would be the easiest emulator to accomplish this with?  The MP3 support seems to be the biggest annoyance so far, since most of the sound libraries these emulators are using only support WAV or OGG.
<br />
<br />Right now I'm thinking that the general solution is to recognize the sound init function being called (or maybe the play function?), determine what exactly is being accessed, and compare that to a hard-coded set of memory locations that correspond to the 24 songs in the game.  Then any time that song would begin playing, just start streaming the MP3 and prevent the emu from actually playing the original music.  Obviously, I'm using pretty general terms, as I still don't completely have my head around the specifics of what the emulator is doing.  So...
<br />
<br />3. Does that solution sound feasible/correct?  If so, what's really the best way to implement it?
<br />
<br />Anyway, I greatly appreciate any help, and, uh, sorry for that wall of text.

You need to first find/write a ROM patch that causes music tracks in the game to be silent (trying to do this on the emulator side would be very difficult), then have the emulator watch whatever memory location the game uses to keep track of the current song playing.

<br />There's a cleaner solution: the NES program writes the song number to a register somewhere in $5000-$5FFF, and then the emulator plays the song. It'd be a lot like the way the Famicom version of Bases Loaded plays some of its sound effects. In fact, the method I describe could easily be implemented on the NES hardware by mapping a serial port into that address space and having the serial port control a CD player or an MP3 player.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, the reason I'm using MP3 is I'm intending to distribute this in a technically legal manner.  So I'd include the emulator, and I suppose the ROM patch (which is actually a pretty good idea), but it would be up to the end user to supply the MP3s and the ROM...and I'm pretty confident the end user will have the songs in an MP3 format (since that's how they were originally distributed).
<br />
<br />Basically, if I use OGG or WAV, then I need to include a song pack, or require the end user to convert their MP3's, which would be an annoyance.
<br />
<br />Oh, and I got the MP3 files legally from the band (The Megas, <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.themegas.com">www.themegas.com</a><!-- w -->) when I bought the CD.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I found a RAM map for MM2:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://datacrystal.org/wiki/Mega_Man_2:RAM_map">http://datacrystal.org/wiki/Mega_Man_2:RAM_map</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />So, if I'm reading this correctly, the current song playing is stored in $0067 in the RAM, right?  That'd make it pretty simple.

<br />Yes, it would be pretty simple to patch the ROM to write to a mapper register instead of $0067.

<br />6502 isn't everyone's bag, even if they know a decent programming language. There's space enough to specifically make 00-20 music inits write to multiple unique addresses.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've done something similar with my (stalled) Super Mario World project, except instead of integrating the player with the emulator, I made a stand-alone app that runs in the background. All it does is peek at the emulator's memory (currently ZSNES, others can be added easily) and wait for a specific byte sequence at a specific location in the emulated WRAM. Once found, it uses the next two bytes as a track number (xx.MP3) and play control. It only took a few minor hacks in SMW's sound code to interface with the player, and I'll probably add a routine that will reactivate the standard SPC music if the player isn't running (hopefully keeping emulation purists happy).

<br />Now if I could just get my hacking groove back... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" />

<br />Already fixed the code to reflect that, now it attempts to play all of the songs at the correct times...the problem is, now I can't seem to get them to play.  I'm using the FMOD library for MP3 support, and it works fine when I test it in another project, and it even occasionally decides to work properly with this project, but for whatever reason, it just doesn't work consistently.

Have the emulator respond to writes to a certain otherwise unused address, and patch the ROM to write there instead of starting the music normally. Then the emulator can have a directory of replacement soundtracks, each named by the byte written, in a directory named after the original ROM, with perhaps an IPS patch inside. Then you could add a GUI option "use custom soundtrack, if available" and it'd be completely automatic, and extensible without having to recompile the emulator.
