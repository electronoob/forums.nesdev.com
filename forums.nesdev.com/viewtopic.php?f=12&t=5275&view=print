<br />
<br />I am using channel 1 (0-7) to do graphics updates during vblank.  That part is working fine on all systems.  
<br />
<br />I am using channel 0 to do data transfer from ROM to WRAM, not necessarily in vblank.  This is the part that doesn't work on the FC Twin.    Putting WAI before the DMA code doesn't help, and neither does forcing vblank using $2100 before the DMA.  My code seems pretty basic:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &#40;16 bit X/Y, 8 bit A&#41;<br />&nbsp; ldx destLo<br />&nbsp; stx $2181<br />&nbsp; lda #$00<br />&nbsp; sta $2183&nbsp; ;;load the WRAM dest address<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; lda #$08<br />&nbsp; sta $4300&nbsp; &nbsp;;;no source increment<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; lda #$80<br />&nbsp; sta $4301&nbsp; &nbsp;;;dest = wram, $2180<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; lda sourcelow<br />&nbsp; sta $4302<br />&nbsp; lda sourcehigh<br />&nbsp; sta $4303<br />&nbsp; lda sourcebank<br />&nbsp; sta $4304<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; ldx sourceBytes16<br />&nbsp; stx $4305&nbsp; &nbsp;;;size in bytes<br /><br />&nbsp; lda #$01<br />&nbsp; sta $420B&nbsp; &nbsp;;Initiate transfer using channel 0</div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm a little confused by what it is you're trying to do here.  :-)
<br />
<br />My first question is: why are you using $2180 and $2181?  WRAM is memory mapped to $0000-1FFF in banks $00-3F and $80-BF, as well as bank $7E (I think).
<br />
<br />Next, you're claiming you're copying part of the ROM space to WRAM directly (e.g. A-bus --&gt; B-bus, where A-bus == ROM/CPU and B-bus == $2180), but I see you're setting D3 of $4300 to 1, which stops the A-bus address from incrementing when reading from the source.
<br />
<br />This would cause the DMA transfer to essentially copy a single byte of data in ROM to $2180, for a total of sourceBytes16 times.  You also have the code comment "no source increment", which implies that's what you want.
<br />
<br />This means your DMA transfer is being used solely to clear WRAM by using a DMA transfer, copying a single byte from sourcebank/sourcehigh/sourcelow into $2180 over and over.  You can accomplish the exact same using a simple loop.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, if you're trying to copy a "chunk" of existing memory (ROM or otherwise) into WRAM, you should set D3 of $4300 to 0 and D4 of $4300 to 0, to ensure that the A-bus address is incremented.
<br />
<br />Another workaround for copying data using DMA is to use the MVN opcode.  The SFC's DMA gives you a lot more control than MVN, but for copying memory around, MVN can get the job done.  Or just go with a custom loop...  :-)

<br />Think of it as memory mapped IO, not an actual ROM chip.  I will test it but I doubt the non incrementing source is the problem anyways.
<br />
<br />Of course there are other (slower) ways of doing it, but that wasn't the question.  Code like the starter kit uses it to clear WRAM, but that is likely before the PPU is enabled.  I don't want to say it is just clone incompatibility since the SNES clones seem to be very good.

<br />Anomie's docs say you can't DMA <strong>between</strong> WRAM and $2180, because the WRAM can't respond to both buses at once.  Between ROM and $2180 is no problem, and works on the real SNES.

<br />
<br />You remember correctly -- MVN/MVP are indeed slow.  My point was to offer an alternative if needed.  Plus, given that I wasn't sure what bunnyboy was trying to do (re: is this code intended to just init WRAM, or is it actually wanting to copy ROM contents into WRAM?), it's a legitimate alternative to said problem.  That said, it's almost always faster to do things in an actual loop vs. using MVN/MVP, but again, depends on what the code was trying to do.
<br />
<br />I'll read the rest of the thread after I've slept.  :)

<br />Turns out there is frequently a sysclk glitch at the beginning of DMA.  This is no problem when reading from ROM, because the value doesn't change.  When reading from IO the glitch triggers and extra read, shifting everything over.  Now to figure out how to detect that clone and switch to a fixed loop...

<br />Can't just check for alignment wrong because it doesn't happen every time.  Would have to do something like run it 10-20x and see if any fail.

<br />
<br />The reason I ask about HDMA is that there's a documented bug in the SFC (and possibly the Twin, or maybe they have to emulate it!) which happens where an HDMA transfer starts shortly before a DMA transfer finishes.  I can outline the bug if people need details, but it sounds unrelated to this problem.
<br />
<br />I guess you've found a nice quirk in the FC Twin... :)
