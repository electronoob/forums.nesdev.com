<br />
<br />The title screen in my game uses a light green color for color #0, but there are large bands of dark green running across the top and bottom sections.
<br />
<br />When I reset the game, the entire screen flashes light green for exactly one frame. Since the dark green bands are drawn the very next frame, the contrast makes the flash quite noticeable.
<br />
<br />Ideally, I'd like to display a black screen (or possibly a dark green screen) for that first frame after resetting. But it appears that the PPU uses whatever color happens to reside in color #0 at that time. I tried initializing the palette as soon as humanly possible in the reset routine, but that didn't work.
<br />
<br />So, is it possible to set the display color for the very first frame after reset? And if so, how?

<br />
<br />Personally I always use black for BG color for some reason, but I agree in some cases it may be desirable to have another color.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ooh! Maybe this will work for you, as yesterday I went through and rewrote how I handle palettes, so I can easily change the colors in my main loop while not having to worry about turning off the PPU and what-not. I finally figured out that it's possible to have some space set aside in RAM for the palette, and pull that in during every NMI. Maybe you could use the same sort of thing in this way: Have the first time you pull in a 'palette' be all $0f for your black, and the next frame write the actual palette to RAM, which will then be pulled in by the NMI.
<br />
<br />If you end up using this method, just make sure you set $2006 back to it's original state before the NMI happened, which you can do with some reserved bytes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Also it seems strange, but I believe the color shown for the background is actually the one being pointed to by $2006.  So if light green is the last color written to your palette initially, I'm thinking if the screen is off and you do nothing else with $2006/$2007 for a while, that will be the background color during that time.
<br />
<br />I've done all kinds of weird stuff with the palettes in tests, trying to get more colors, and I learned that if you want a 'clean' palette update that you need to be in vblank or hblank.  So the way Roth said is best, it's what I do also, just keep a buffer and blast it into VRAM on every NMI.  It's what a lot (most?) of commercial games do too (I've seen many NMI routines while ripping NSFs, heheh <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ).

<br />As long as you set the PPU adress to $3f00 imediately after writing to the palette you should be fine. (you're sure the background color displayed is the desired one).

<br />I gave your code a shot, but unfortunately it didn't work.
<br />
<br />Out of curiosity, what's the significance of setting the PPU address back to zero? Is that considered good form?

<br />
<br />yeah what's up with that.
<br />
<br />@servicedude: I remember reading that if the ppu address lies in the palette ram, and the screen is disabled, it displays the color pointed to in palette ram.  So that would ensure that the display color is the one that has just been written (col 0).

<br />That's true for the operator of the power button; however, if there's a crowd of spectators, I want to deliver the most professional presentation possible. That one frame could make the difference between a fun party and a trip to the emergency room following an epileptic seizure. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />
<br />
<br />But in this particular case, it seems like a no-go. Oh well, no biggie.
