I think Dead_Body and FDSEmu would be a pretty good notion if you wanted to ask him.  He's incorporated a lot of different formats already for the disk emulator to accept.  NSF shouldn't be that much more difficult with a player.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3466">B00daW</a> — Sat Mar 12, 2016 11:30 am</p><hr />

That NSF plays correctly when NSFPlay's &quot;$4085 resets modulator phase&quot; hack is enabled.<br /><br />A lot of defective homebrew FDS tracks seem to rely on this behaviour, which is precisely why I didn't implement it in my own player.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7168">Rahsennor</a> — Thu Mar 10, 2016 7:33 pm</p><hr />

With the last version of NSFPlay I did a lot to try and make FDS sound <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=10233" class="postlink">as accurate as I could</a> to the actual sound of my FDS. I can't say what the &quot;most&quot; accurate FDS emulator is, but I think NSFPlay is very good. If you or anyone can produce a hardware test that shows a difference from NSFPlay, I'd love to hear it.<br /><br />There's also the Twin Famicom made by sharp that is a combination FDS and Famicom with a single unit. The balance of sound is typically very different with these, I believe. (The FDS is much louder.) Even between individual FDS units there is some variation too, like the process is the same but some units will be louder or more quiet.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Thu Mar 10, 2016 6:40 am</p><hr />

I'm working on something related to FDS audio, but I don't own the hardware and wanted to prepare some examples. NSFplay is usually my program of choice for listening to NSF files, but I wasn't sure if something else was considered king in this area.<br /><br />When I use the nsfimport version of Famitracker, it certainly sounds different in there, which is a bummer because I do like the export to wav function in Famitracker.<br /><br />Or if anyone knows of proper FDS hardware recordings, that'd be very helpful for me to listen and compare.<br /><br />- - - - -<br /><br />Tangentially related, I've started collecting some FDS instruments and posting them here:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://famicomdisksystem.imgur.com/">http://famicomdisksystem.imgur.com/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I'm seeing some repeated instruments across different games, even by different companies. In some cases it wouldn't be obvious by ear because the instrument might have heavy modulation applied and be used as a sound effect in one game, while being a normal melodic voice in another.<br /><br />I'm guessing there was some kind of shared toolset for developing for the FDS? This seems like a very specific waveform to appear in both Nintendo (Zelda) and Konami games (Ai Senshi Nicol, Arumana no Kiseki, who knows what else...):<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://i.imgur.com/QBeb4b2.png">http://i.imgur.com/QBeb4b2.png</a><!-- m --><br /><br />There are other examples too and I've only looked at five games so far.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1096">bucky o'hare</a> — Thu Mar 10, 2016 1:26 am</p><hr />
