<br />
<br />I am working on an NES specific disassembler in Java. It is fully interactive, does code / data separation, and more... I wish I could upload a screenshot. I hope to have a beta release ready by the weekend. Anyone interested?

<br />
<br />if the loaded .NES file has more than 2 code blocks, it only disasms the last 2.
<br />
<br />I have only been working on it for 4 days but, I think it is coming along quite nicely.

<br />Send me an email and I'll send you a screenshot if you want.

<br />
<br />About the mappers, well... you should learn about them, but once you get it, the tracing becomes trivial.
<br />
<br />Anyway, best luck with your program. ^_^;; I'm interested.

<br />
<br />As far as the code/data sep, I just follow the code through the reset, nmi &amp; irq_brk vectors. I have an interactive jump table builder in there, too - i.e, you give the start address and num of entries.
<br />
<br />I will look into the .cdl file right now - that may be a great feature.
<br />
<br />About mappers &amp; disasm, if I am thinking right, say the game megaman.nes was loaded. it has 26 code blocks, and uses mapper 2 (UNROM).  the last block in this rom loads at C000. All of the other blocks would have an org of $8000, correct?
<br />

Where did you get that number? UNROM has up to 8 banks (128 KiB), and UOROM has up to 16 (256 KiB).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">and uses mapper 2 (UNROM).  the last block in this rom loads at C000. All of the other blocks would have an org of $8000, correct?</div>
<br />Yes. In theory, it's also possible to switch the last bank into $8000 duplicating the bank fixed at $C000, but I don't see why any game would do that.
<br />
<br />Mapper 180 (used for Crazy Climber) is like U*ROM, but it fixes the <em>first</em> bank of the ROM at $8000 and allows switching $C000. This can change where the vectors point, so be careful.
<br />
<br />Mappers 7 (A*ROM), 34a (B*ROM), and 34b (NINA-001) use 32 KiB switching: writing to the bank register puts a whole 32 KiB bank into $8000. So if you're going by 16 KiB banks, you'd use org $8000 for even banks and $C000 for odd banks.
<br />
<br />Mapper 1 (S*ROM, MMC1 chip) has multiple modes. Most games use it like UNROM, but it can also act like B*ROM or (rarely) like Crazy Climber.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Your right... It only has 8 blocks... I was looking at the mappers.nfo file and for mapper number 2 it says 
<br />
<br /> Notes: - When the cart is first started, the first 16K ROM bank in the cart
<br />           is loaded into $8000, and the LAST 16K ROM bank is loaded into
<br />           $C000. This last 16K bank is permanently "hard-wired" to $C000,
<br />           and it cannot be swapped.
<br />
<br />        - This mapper has no provisions for VROM; therefore, all carts
<br />           using it have 8K of VRAM at PPU $0000.
<br />
<br />        - Most carts with this mapper are 128K. A few, mostly Japanese
<br />           carts, such as Final Fantasy 2 and Dragon Quest 3, are 256K.
<br />
<br />        - Overall, this is one of the easiest mappers to implement in
<br />           a NES emulator. 
<br />
<br /> So, from that, I got that all blocks except the last one would be mapped at $8000, no?

<br />As tepples said, the programmer can choose to map the last bank at $8000 (just like any other bank), in adition to it being already mapped at $c000. I doubt many games, if any, did this. But it's just good to know that it's possible.
