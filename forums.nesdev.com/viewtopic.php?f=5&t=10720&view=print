Do 4bpp sprites cause extra flickering, or is the system just limited to 2bpp sprites?</div><br />If you play a lot of MSX1 games, you'll notice a lot of them will suffer <em>badly</em> from sprite flicker, especially if the main character is a multi-colored sprite, since you need one sprite for each color, which means the individual colors of the character will flicker.<br /><br />I think you can only have 4 sprites per scanline too, but you can have 16x16 sprites, so it balances out.

Multicolored means each horizontal pixel line of a sprite can have its own color. To get more colors you have to overlap sprites.<br /><br />MSX2 also has entirely different blitter-like rendering system which allows to have as much sprites as one wants, in trade of speed.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I read the entiere original Dracula by Bram Stoker, and as far as I remember, the following things were hazardous to vampires :<br /><br />- Garlic - although it would not prevent anything they would just not like the smell<br />- Host and crucifixes and anyother catholic religious sign.<br />- Flowing water (stagnant water is okay though)<br />- Not staying in quality earth for a long period of extended time - this is why he has to ship some special earth boxes to London and how they were able to catch him<br /><br />Anything else has been made up afterwards. Dracula also comes to several places without being invited in the story. Also the guy is old, ugly and has a mustache, something that was changed in most remakes of the story.<br /><br />PS : Sprites on the MSX sucks, I mean 1 BP ? How comes so many NES games were ported to MSX ?
