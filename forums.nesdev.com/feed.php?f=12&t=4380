I barely understand what you said about mirroring but thanks for your interested in my tpoic anyway heheh<br /><br />Basically I'm so desperate to do this that I even built 12MB dev-cart today. Basically it is designed for 8MB memory (exHIROM) + 4MB memory configured as LOROM. All memories have been connected exactly this way:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cs.umb.edu/~bazz/snes/96MbCart/derp.html">http://www.cs.umb.edu/~bazz/snes/96MbCart/derp.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />PCB:<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yhfSVR8.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yk6C9Rv.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />74LS139 is connected like this:<br /><br />01-MAD-1 pin#04<br />02-MAD-1 pin#12 (shared with PCB)<br />03-GND<br />04-/OE ROM 4MB (LOROM)<br />05-/OE ROM 8MB (EXHIROM)<br />06-NC<br />07-NC<br />08-GND<br />(and pin#16 is +5V)<br /><br />I can confirm once again that Star Ocean configured this way does NOT work on this board: 8MB ROM consists of ROM2+ROM1 (written in this order) and 4MB ROM is ROM3.<br /><br />Anyway I also programmed Holy Striker Batman 12MB ROM (provided by tepples) the same way as Star Ocean above. Here's what I got:<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/78A4drj.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Is this correct??<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3986">MaarioS</a> — Wed Apr 01, 2015 12:06 pm</p><hr />

This means SNES must read ExHIROM game when SNES A22 is also low...<br /></div><br /><br />A22 isn't actively driven in ExHiRom games except for sram conditions.  The converted star ocean drives that line for reading the additional eprom.   Generally speaking, lines that aren't being driven are held low.   This why most games (lots of exceptions) can run without mirroring.  Example.  You can put mario in a much bigger rom without mirroring.  Mario is a small game  that a high address line of A18.  so what happens if A21 (and A20 or A19) is driven high?  All the mario game data will vanish because it would be banked-out.  For the snes to even see the Mario game in a big rom, it has to hold the higher address lines low.   If you mirrored the mario data then it would still be seen even if A21 was driven high.  My point, unused lines are <em>generally</em> held low.   Games like Megaman X, even though it's a small game, has to be mirrored if you put it in a big rom -- cause every now and then, it drives the A21 line high for whatever reason... Super Bonk is the same way too.  <br /><br />These are my observations anyway..... I have zero electronics training so I may have butchard the terminology. <br /><br />In the decompressed star ocean, if A22 goes high, it's looking for data from Rom3, when it's low, it's looking for the ExHiRom data.  This is how my decoder works.<br /><br />Edit-- shouldn't your pin 13 be connected to something on your 2nd example decoder?<br /><br />Edit 2:  well, I shouldn't post from memory -- got the A22 high/low backwards after looking at my documentation.  Sorry.   When A22 is <strong>LOW</strong>, it's looking for Rom3, when A22 is <strong>HIGH</strong>, it's looking for the ExHiRom data.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5779">Markfrizb</a> — Wed Apr 01, 2015 4:29 am</p><hr />

Using the ExHiRom game as an example, and using a 64mbit flash rom (the 3volt aspect is a WHOLE other topic) you shouldn't need any decoders at all.  It should be how your rom is programmed and using A23 (mask rom pin 35, cart edge 48) as the highest address connection.  It's because of the different mapping between the ExHirom and lo rom is why you have a need for a decoder because you most likely will use 2 separate roms and thus, the need for a decoder to control the 2 devices.  How your rom works with Crimson Echos as exhiRom is a mystery to me. You haven't mentioned how you've connect A23 or how you built your rom with the data.   Your second decoder example  as an ExHiRom -- a22 isn't used to decode a ExHiRom and because you are using a 8m flash rom, deciding isn't needed.   That make sense?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5779">Markfrizb</a> — Tue Mar 31, 2015 9:20 pm</p><hr />

So Rom3 is deactivated and 2nd decoder of the 139 is now enabled wherein A23 decides which of the 2 roms will be activated in the EXhiRom configuration.   <br /><br />Remember, ONLY 1 rom can ever be active at any one time.  <br /><br />have fun!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5779">Markfrizb</a> — Mon Mar 30, 2015 9:31 am</p><hr />

Either way I made my cart this way: 8MB memory is configured as ExHIROM and as far as I'm concerned ExHIROM games have to be kind of swapped: SECOND 4MB of code goes to the FIRST half of the memory and FIRST 4MB of code goes to the SECOND part of the memory. After that I interleaved data of ROM3 (last 4MB of code) and connected it to my board. After all that I connected my memories to PCB and added a 74LS139 decoder and connected everything this way:<br /><br />16-5V<br />15-MAD-1 pin #04<br />14-MAD-1 pin #12 (SNES con. pin#47-A22)<br />13-GND<br />12-/OE of 4MB memory (ROM3)<br />11-/OE of 8MB memory (ROM2+ROM1)<br />10-<br />09-<br />(and pin#08 is of course GND)<br /><br />Either way it is not working <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> .....<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3986">MaarioS</a> — Mon Mar 30, 2015 9:09 am</p><hr />

So they are there, you just can't see them.  <br /><br />Yes, the last 4mb (3rd rom) is wired just as if it was a lo rom mapper.  I reorganized my star ocean rom data in rom3 to reduce my wiring which is why you <em>don't</em> see a bunch of wires running around....<br /><br />Referring to the link you posted, that's not how my decoder is connected but if you had 2 flash roms (1 64mbit and 1 32mbit) then that decoder configuration woukd work.  That decoder diagram doesn't show how A23 is used in a exhirom decoding.  If you are using a donor, then I wouldn't use that diagram becuse the sram enabling is already handled by the mad1.  All you need to be concerned about is how to handle all 3 roms' OE lines and wiring rom3 as if it was a lo rom (skip A15).<br />Good luck!  I'm sure you'll get there.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5779">Markfrizb</a> — Mon Mar 30, 2015 4:41 am</p><hr />
