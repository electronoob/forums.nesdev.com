I started rom hacking around 2000 or so and was interested in rom expansion. Every document I looked at said something along the lines of "Nes rom expansion is impossible. If you don't know how, don't try, and those that do know why." Eventually I ended up at nesdev and homebrew kinda trumped rom hacking for me.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=187">never-obsolete</a> — Tue Mar 01, 2011 8:06 am</p><hr />

More accurate information. Better tools, etc.<br /><br />As for the question.. I first started learning 6502 assembly in 2000. I think I did some crappy ROM at the time that played NSFs (though it only worked in Nesticle), but that was about it. It wasn't until 3 years later that I took a more serious stab at it and began writing my own NES emulator, and I also wrote a few small things for the NES itself in the years that followed. <br />What I remember from those days was the hassle of testing stuff on HW, since I didn't have any kind of dev cart myself. So I used to send ROMs to Bananmos (we went to the same school at the time) and asked him to test them on his NES since he had an EPROM-emulator. And he would say "yeah it works" or "no, it doesn't work", and I would have no idea what it looked like when it ran. Not exactly the best way of doing things  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Nowadays I do very little NES development, but I've done a lot of SNES development over the past year, and I still find a lot of the threads here interesting to read.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1181">mic_</a> — Tue Mar 01, 2011 6:20 am</p><hr />

I was programming an Apple IIe in assembly language back in middle school in the early 1990s, which is how I learned 6502 asm. I became interested in NES emulation sometime in the 2000s, and I wrote a few demos that worked on the emulators of the time but not necessarily on NES hardware because I had no way to test. Zophar.net had some of the documents (including koitsu's that you mention). I coded for the NES off and on, mixed with PC and GBA coding. My interest in NES programming really picked up once I got my PowerPak and could see my work run on the real thing.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Tue Mar 01, 2011 6:11 am</p><hr />

I've been interested in NES coding since mid/end of the 90's since me and my pal started coding on our emulator. I remember it well since nesdev.com was a top-secret website back then and Yoshi's NES document was top-secret aswell and only shared to reliable people only.<br />Those were the days.. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=353">oRBIT2002</a> — Tue Mar 01, 2011 12:14 am</p><hr />
