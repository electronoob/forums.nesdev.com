Ok I've taken out the 2 Sachens for you. The others whether they currently appear to be dupes or just have a minute difference like the Mfg ID, they are being kept for a reason <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />BTW, this "Manufacturer ID", I have yet to determine exactly what that number is. In some cases the number has a direct relation to the manufacturer of the board inside. 24 always has Konami PCB inside, 17 always has an epoxy type board inside, etc.<br /><br />I'd love to get a definitive answer on what the number represents. Nintendo still stamps carts with these 2-digit codes to this day (GBA,DS).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=158">BootGod</a> — Fri Oct 17, 2008 12:00 pm</p><hr />

Let me know the profile # and I'll do that.<br /><br />Not too long ago, I changed things so every cart dumped has it's own profile rather than ignoring it if it was an apparent dupe.

So if you (or anyone for that matter) are in no hurry to dump carts, it would be easier to just wait for the new version. I'm certainly not going to stop anyone just to save me a little time though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=158">BootGod</a> — Thu Oct 16, 2008 2:57 pm</p><hr />

The DLL used for parallel port access is inpout32.dll, but again I doubt this is the problem for you as it's just a driver for post-98/ME hardware access. Most likely your of the unlucky many stuck with a parallel port that just won't work with CopyNES period. Your best bet would be to get a PCI par port card. I've never tested any of those however, so I'm unable to recommend a specific model.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=158">BootGod</a> — Wed Oct 15, 2008 6:26 pm</p><hr />

Wow, I'm surprised that is all that you needed to do to get it working on 98, I've never even tested it on 98, but I figured there would many more DLL related problems and Unicode issues. I could probably link that FTD2XX DLL differently, as it's only required for USB support.<br /><br />It's going be a while before a new version of the dumping software comes out. I really want get the new site / DB online first and the software is going to need quite a bit of work for the changes I've made.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=158">BootGod</a> — Mon Oct 13, 2008 5:36 pm</p><hr />

I was first very disappointed to find out that my old Windows 98 machine couldn't be my CopyNES dump station once again since I was getting an FTD2XX.DLL error stating incompatibilities with SETUPAPI.DLL protocols.  The first thing I tried was installing a newer version of <a href="http://www.mdgx.com/files/SETUPAPI.EXE" class="postlink">SETUPAPI.DLL from MGDX</a>, but was still left with the same error.  What really did the trick was downgrading the FTD2XX.DLL to the <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX/Win98/D30104.zip" class="postlink">Windows 98/ME version.</a><br /><br />Now BootGod's NESCartDB works on Windows 98/ME. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br /><img src="http://img46.imageshack.us/img46/6452/nescartdblu3.png" alt="Image" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3466">B00daW</a> — Sun Oct 12, 2008 9:25 pm</p><hr />
