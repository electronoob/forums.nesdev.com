<br />Let's imagine a NES console with a modern CPU, something like a 2-3GHz CPU but with the same graphics capabilites as the real NES.
<br />Assuming this was possible, how do you think NES games / homebrew would look? Would it even be fun to code on a 2GHz NES?

<br />Actually, this makes sense if you want to make very authentic looking NES-style retro game or demake for PC or other modern system - emulate PPU and APU, with game code in the system's native code.

It was a 133MHz Pentium I think, which is nowhere near 2GHz but is a lot faster than the regular NES CPU. I believe he successfully controlled the PPU with PC code, doing essentially what is suggested in this thread.

<br />I think it's pointless project (as would be a PC game using NES constraints) but I would like to see what someone could do with it nonetheless. I'd rather see someone use emulator PPU/APU code than repurpose real game hardware.
<br />
<br />A fast CPU (and fast memory and no PPU bottleneck) would allow you to:
<br />
<br />-update nametables, attributes and CHR-RAM per rendered BG tile 
<br />-update the palette during Hblank
<br />-use a really complex sound engine, with steaming PCM etc
<br />-use intensity bits on a pixel basis?

<br />
<br />- I didn't get the idea. If it's a 1ghz CPU, I suppose the "new" NES would run at such speed; by clocking at ~1mhz, seems to lose the "essence" of more speed... ?

<br />Imagine a TV tuner cartridge for the NES. An ASIC on the cartridge reads a 256x240 pixel frame buffer, determines the best of four palettes for each 8x1 pixel sliver, and then dithers the pixels down to the NES's 2bpp and feeds them to the PPU. It also collects statistics on the color distribution to choose the palettes for the next frame. Now imagine a typical smartphone system-on-chip, with a 1 GHz ARM CPU and integrated PowerVR GPU, rendering to this frame buffer.

<br />In this thought experiment, the CPU is clocked orders of magnitude faster, but the PPU is clocked at the same rate as the NES PPU.

<br />Yeah, you'd still need it to feed the mixed audio to $4011, to read the controllers, and possibly to stuff the palette depending on how the PPU is connected. It'd become an IOP, like the MC68000 on the Jaguar, or the PS1 MIPS on the PS2, or the ARM7 on the DS, or the "Starlet" ARM9 on the Wii.
