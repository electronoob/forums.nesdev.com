Please let me know. And yes i'm using the correct power supply which i'm using the SNS-002 Power adpater.

Maybe 5 years ago, but now they are probably $80 or more, and still rising.<br /><br />If a genuine SNES console stops working, by all means buy a new one, but never throw the old one out. Depending on what issues it suffer, repairs may be either very easy or at least doable, or in a worst case scenario it should be kept for spare parts.<br />Ths is classic hardware that I'm all for preserving in as large amounts as possible.

Well, I bought some gems on <a href="https://www.mercadolivre.com.br/" class="postlink">MercadoLivre</a> by a very very good price, like R$20 for a sealed copy of... Space Invaders, or around R$60 for a sealed Tetris &amp; Dr.Mario cart, or a SMW2: Yoshi's Island cart-only NEW. Today, everything's MUCH more expensive, unfortunately. Heh, all those sealed ones were OPENED  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /> but well preserved here.

If a regular DMA transfer ends right before an HDMA transfer, a race condition or something can lock up the CPU.  I'm not sure if there are any games where this actually occurs; it's mostly an issue for homebrewers who might want to use both DMA and HDMA at the same time.  The ability to do this could be very useful, but you can't exactly release a game that only works on some units; your options are to (a) detect rev.1 CPUs and have the game perform worse or drop features to avoid triggering the bug, or (b) just write the game so the bug doesn't happen, which typically means keeping your DMA restricted to VBlank or other periods where you know HDMA isn't running.<br /><br />On the subject of reliability, it seems that some S-CPUs are starting to go bad nowadays.  Back in the day they were very reliable, but they're getting older.  Other stuff can go bad too, but aside from leaky caps (which are easy to replace), the CPU seems to be the most common failure.  In fact I personally have an old SNES that does weird stuff like loading the wrong map and collision data in F-Zero or the wrong background graphics in Yoshi's Island, failing to draw the map or spawn powerups in Super Metroid, that sort of thing.  I haven't had it diagnosed, but the CPU seems to be a likely candidate.<br /><br />I figure if you can replace your car's inline 4 with a V12 and call it the same car, you can replace an S-CPU with a new chip that does the exact same thing and call it the same SNES.  Unfortunately it's probably not reasonable to attempt a production run of S-CPUs for this purpose, but perhaps an FPGA version might be feasible...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />SNES is still one of the cheapest and most numerous systems though, both hardware and software. Here in Japan Super Famicom is dirt cheap and you can get one on ebay even with controllers and cables for less than $10 (of course shipping might be a lot more depending on where you live). I got a PAL SNES (since my childhood), an 1CHIP SFC and a non-1CHIP SFC. And I'm thinking of one day hunt for a 1/1/1 SFC.<br /><br />Only problem with SFC might be that US carts won't fit without an adapter, and it's not easy to mod the case without destroying the aesthetics. Also it can't use a SNES adapter or it will become BBQ.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah if you live outside USA a US SNES will be very expensive, and as I find them unattractive I don't see myself getting one anytime soon. SFC cart slot is same shape as PAL SNES so you can't just break tabs. I did mention using an adapter was one way, sawing up the cart slot into a square shape is what hurts the aesthetics. I think an adapter would be the preferable way, and I'd probably do it that way if I get an US cart someday for some reason. The problem with using an adapter is it introduces an extra cart connector problem (unless it's newly produced).<br /><br />One reason I prefer the SD2SNES over the Everdrive is the <a href="https://db-electronics.ca/2017/07/05/the-dangers-of-3-3v-flash-in-retro-consoles/#Super_Everdrive" class="postlink">3.3 V translation problem</a>. Another is the fantastic compatibility.
