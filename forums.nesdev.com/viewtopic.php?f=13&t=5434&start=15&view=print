I've abandoned the name Alien X a long time ago, and I go by the new name in Youtube, so I'd like to keep it synced up.<br /><br />Also, if That BioMechanical Dude is too long for this forum (like it is in the Famitracker forums), then just BioMechanical Dude would work fine.<br /><br />Thanks.

Searching for old posts could also be very difficult. It's a good thing that users have to ask the mods to change their names, because it discourages this confusing practice and all the changes are documented somewhere people can check.

Continuity is also why I assign a special rank for users whose name has changed.<br /><br />AlienX is now BioMechanical Dude.<br /><br />The Suri/Sarai thing might have been the result of 1. asking someone orally what the word is, 2. writing it down as you hear it using your native language's orthography, and then 3. misinterpreting what you wrote down because English orthography is so messed up. In this case:<br /><br />1. /səˈraɪ/<br />2. &quot;Suri&quot; (with long I)<br />3. /ˈsʊri/ DAMN YOU GREAT VOWEL SHIFT!

In one forum, which I was a member of, there was this user that constantly changed their username. Either they were a mod or the mods were very kind to them, or the site allowed name changes. Hmmm...

This had been the first real forum I had joined, so I created a name like everyone else, but afterward, I got a YouTube account in order to comment, where you could only use the name from your gmail until you got 500 subscribers, which I don't care about. With every forum I've joined since, I've gone by Drew Sebastino, and I thought I'd just make my name consistent all across the board.
