		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had so much fun building my first snes repo cart ( Zelda Parallel worlds ) that I want to try something harder. I want to build an NTSC patched Terranigma cart. I sorted through my collection and found a cart that I'd be willing to sacrifice for the challenge and confirmed that both Terranigma and Donor match.  <br /><br />Target -&gt; Terranigma: 64K SRAM, Hirom, 32Mbit, Fastrom<br />Donor -&gt; Ken Griffy Jr Winning Run: 64K SRAM, Hirom, 32Mbit, Fastrom<br /><br />Some immediate confusion though, Ken Griffy uses a single 36pin 32Mbit eprom. For the challenge I want to use 4x27c801 eproms which are of course 32pin 8mbit eproms. I do not want to try the 40pin TSOP to 36pin dip method yet... I'll save that for my third challenge <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Previously when using 2x27c801 on a cart that already had (2) 32pin slots it was simply a matter of building and splitting the rom correctly and then rerouting the 2 addresses on each of the 27c801 eproms. I'm unsure how to properly stack 4x27c801 chips together and then how to properly wire the stack to the single 36pin slot. I assume that I'll also have to wire each of the 27c801's into the existing &quot;MAD-1 A&quot; chip thats already  on the donor cart.<br /><br />Any help or direction would be sincerely appreciated.<br /><br />Thank you!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Looks like buyicnow has some stock, am I correct in thinking that the &quot;<strong>ST M29F032D-70N6 (TSOP Adapter III)</strong>&quot; pre-mounted solution is compatible? I see that many people are using <strong>AM29F032B-90EC</strong>. Is speed the only difference between the two chips ? If I understand correctly, the only difference between the 70N6 and the 90EC is the speed, 70N6 being faster and more expensive, though noting that the snes won't benefit from anything faster than &quot;120&quot; ?<br /><br />Still learning, but having a lot of fun. Thank you all for your help.

I'm trying to build a 16Mbit HIROM test board. I'm a bit confused though about the address remapping.<br /><br />The diagram says to route A18 and A17 to the locations market A18 and A17 on the PCB. However it does not say where to route the pins that would normally populate those same locations on the PCB, A15 and A12 on the 27c801. Are these supposed to float or do they get remapped on the board too ?

The 74xx139 is your best choice.   Not too many threads down, I posted a schematic of how to wires the roms to the 139...<br /><br /><br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=10880#p123783">viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=10880#p123783</a><!-- l --><br /><br />Think about this.... Each address line doubles the rom size.  So 27c080 EPROMs have up to address 19 (A19).  So the next 27c080 would be A20 (2x 27c080 = 16mbits or 2 mBytes)<br />Since A20 is 16mbits, then A21 would be double the 16mbits to equal 32mbits.   So the 74xx139 decodes which 27c080 gets chosen by the A20 and A21 address lines.  Only 1 roms can be active at a time otherwise you would have bus conflicts.  That's what the 139 does.  So the OE (mad1 pin 4 which is exactly the same as the Rom OE) enables the decoder or not, depending if the OE is driven high or low.<br /><br />So with this in mind, if you wanted to use 8 x 27c512 EPROMs. Then you'd need to use the decoder 74ls138 using the A19,A20, and A 21 to do the decoding of which of the 8 roms are chosen.   Now I don't know WHY anyone would want to use 8 27c512 EPROMs outside of academic purposes but maybe it helps in your understanding.  <br /><br />So the tsop adapter is a 32mbit device which already has addresses A20 and A21 so no decoder needed.<br /><br />The swap bin is useful only to reduce the amount of wiring or re-wiring of the the EPROMs to match the carts mask rom pinouts.  It won't help you in how <span style="text-decoration: underline">many</span> EPROMs you'll use.

Soooooo many fantastic people here helped me so I'm glad I can give back.<br /><br />Since you are making this test cart, then you should add 1 more option to it.   Pin 35 of the mask rom (hi rom) would be the next address.  This is where you get the &quot;extended hi rom&quot;. <br /><br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=10805#p123850">viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=10805#p123850</a><!-- l --><br /><br />I haven't quite thought this through, but off the cuff, I suspect a 74xx138 would give you access to up to 8 27c080 EPROMs....  But the ExHirom are usually only 6mbytes or 6 27c080 EPROMs <br /><br />So the 138 would use A20, A21, and A22 (pin 35 mask rom) as inputs.<br /><br />Or you could add a second 139 decoder (or use the other half of the one you'd be using)  for A22.<br />Just thinking out loud there......<br /><br />Happy tinkering!
