		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello board,
<br />
<br />I know that, when it comes to ripping music, things haven't been very lively here, but it's still the best place to ask that I know of.
<br />
<br />For the few past months I've been working on a site that will host music from all handheld systems, starting with mono Game Boy and going through all games released up to... well, whatever system will be supported by then (currently, the newest on is PSP).
<br />
<br />Games will be released in chronological order, with a set number of releases per day - depending on how fast I can process them. All games will have timing data for both NEZPlug and foo_gep plugin (for formats that it supports, obviously), and the whole idea is to have the site work as a sister site to SNESMusic.org, sharing composer/company/ripper/etc data.
<br />
<br />So far I've processed all games up to beginning of 1991, about 160 sets in all, and I must say that some of the stuff people have been able to make with Game Boy sound hardware is just plain amazing.
<br />
<br />I've uploaded progress spreadsheet here:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtIJBoOATMHydEhrM3VkM3BaUkJoeFpqUTl5eHBiX1E&amp;hl=pl#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc ... l=pl#gid=0</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Now, the thing is - I'm using both the existing GBS rips and a tool called GBgbs, which is able to extract music data from ROMs. But GBgbs only supports games that have been released in Japan, and not all of them at that (64 out of 1200 entries are not supported according to the site).
<br />
<br />I have marked the games that don't have a rip in red in the spreadsheet, and did the same for games that have buggy rips (those are in yellow). 
<br />
<br />If any of you can possibly help in any way with this - whether by ripping, providing composer or tagging information, everything will be greatly appreciated.
<br />
<br />I've managed to find the information below on GBgbs forums, maybe it will help with ripping - I haven't been able to do anything with that, but then, my Z80 knowledge is close to non-existent.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, <a href="http://snesmusic.org/pmh/" class="postlink">Portable Music History</a> just went public beta.
<br />
<br />So far there are two sets available for download, with new ones added every 6 hours. For the next few weeks there should be only Game Boy rips there, but once we reach October of 1990 (in about 100 games), Game Gear ones will start showing up too. 
<br />
<br />All sets will be fully timed, and when possible tagged as well - feel free to provide tagging data for those that aren't though.
<br />
<br />Please make sure to share your thoughts or questions here - the site is still missing some functionality (like better integration with SNESMusic.org, RSS feed for updates/new sets, search function), but should be fully usable nevertheless.

<br />
<br />The SMS-GG games do, since they were officially released. But if I take all of Master System games, I would need to include PC Engine and Mega Drive as well, since both of them had official portable version released.
<br />
<br />Basically, every game from the Handheld portion of this site: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://homepage2.nifty.com/gamedatabase/index.html">http://homepage2.nifty.com/gamedatabase/index.html</a><!-- m --> (where there's an emulated music format available, so no Lynx or Visual Boy) + US only and Europe only games.
<br />
<br />iOS games are so far down the line I haven't even thought about them, TBH.
