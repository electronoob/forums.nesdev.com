Well, I don't understand why you're still asking questions so. Yeah, the vertical and horizontal mirroring means that the duplicating of the nametables themselves are done vertically or horizontally, respectively. It would seems more logical to call them on the opposite way, like on the solver pads where there is hardwired mirroring.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Aug 20, 2005 1:17 pm</p><hr />

Alright, did it <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  <br /><br />What it seems to me is that the nametable itself deals with the background...  and I'm guessing that vertical mirroring is called so because the background tiles(?) generate vertically from top to bottom.  I haven't tested any horizontal yet, but I'm guessing the tiles lay out horizontally.  I think the scroll line shows where the left side of the screen is.<br /><br />Now, I noticed that the nametable at $2000 and $2800 (like in Membler's post on the other thread), as well as $2400 and $2C00(?) are the exact same.  Why is this?  I don't understand exactly what it accomplishes when it looks to me like the addresses at $2000 and $2400 are doing enough... or is there something that $2800 and $2C00 are doing that I'm not aware of that add to it?  <br /><br />By the way, I tested mainly with Mega Man 2 and Super Mario Bros. 2 (USA).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=174">Roth</a> — Sat Aug 20, 2005 12:55 pm</p><hr />

Man, this was a crazy thread...<br /><br />Alright, so I'm trying to grasp the concept of mirroring here.  I take it that it's basically how you're game is going to operate in terms of directions of travel pretty much (that's what I got out of it).<br /><br />Horizontal &gt;&gt; Scroll Vertically<br /><br />Vertical &gt;&gt; Scroll Horizontally<br /><br />Now, what are the games that only travel in one direction, and there's no going back? (i.e. Super Mario Bros., you can't go back to the left)  Does that have anything to do with using mirroring?  Also, I don't quite grasp this either, from another thread: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=202">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=202</a><!-- m --> :<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />It means where 2 addresses point to the same memory location.<br /><br />The main example is with the nametables. There's addresses for 4 nametables, but normally only memory for 2 of them. "horizontal mirroring" would mean that writing to (VRAM) $2000 would be the same as writing to $2400. Or with vertical mirroring, writing to $2000 and $2800 would be the same.<br /><br />It also applies to the NES's RAM ($0000-$07FF). Writing to $0900 would be the same as $0100.<br /><br />I hope my explanation makes sense.<br /></div><br /><br />Since mirroring is used you get all four nametables in memory that can be used... I guess... (I'm still not understanding, I'm not even sure if I know what I'm trying to ask here... <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> )  I suppose I should ask what a nametable exactly is, since I can't seem to find a file anywhere that has basic definitions.... or is a nametable something that I'll learn about in my book?<br /><br />Sorry for the blob of crap I just posted, but I am confused on mirroring and the whole concept, and can't quite come up with a way to ask about it <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=174">Roth</a> — Sat Aug 20, 2005 1:16 am</p><hr />

If you don't always change the vertical scroll at the HBLANK when your text box will display, you will be limited to where you can actually "put" your text box + your code will require more logic to put the text box in at the right spots in the 2nd nametable (vertcically), which will indefintly leave your text box needing to be on the screen at only certain spots to show up properly. I also want to make sure I understand this stuff properly so that if I'm wrong, someone will tell me.<br /><br />If you always change vertical scrolling then you can always put your text box at the top of Nametable 2 and then whever scanline's HBLANK your currently in wouldn't matter since you could easily change the address pointer exactly to the top of nametable too (your text box), thus no extra logic wouldn't even be needed (where to put the bytes in Nametable 2) + your text box could be displayed on any scanline instead of needing to be a multiple of 8. Also in HBLANK you'll need to change the MMC5s CHR bank register to the "text" bank, but I'm sure you already knew that.<br /><br />BTW, doynax I don't think especially minds our posts as he, in reality, doesn't have to read them.

Well, since $2005-w2 isn't updated in realtime, the PPU internal address must be updated manually (which is done by writing to $2006). Anyway, An emulator author could tell you better, but generally it wouldn't be too hard. Just keep your nametable data at the top of the "2nd nametable" and come HBLANK time you'll have to write to $2006 ($00, $00?) to sttart at the text box and then change $2006 back to where it should be at the end <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Oh, and about writing to the NT2 for the textbox, it shouldn't take too long to update (what like 6 columns...6x30 = 150 bytes-borders (which are constant) = about 90 bytes), but if it does, span it accross a couple frame.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I can't see why I have to store data like this in Chr-Rom, it's longer to read data and I guess this shall be done in VBlank.

Nintendulator!, Quietust knows everything <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />. and as soon as somethings discovered BOOM it's there. Nessie will prolly get updated soon. Fx3 has an emulator, I think he'll prolly update it. Is FCEU Ultra open source? Well, there'll be a few that do, some that don't. I mean it was just discovered 3 or 4 days ago...1 day ago came KHs doc (which had some interesting info, I thought the 8x8 sprite fetching was interesting), and I'm sure Nintendulator will be updated with that info soon also <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br />As for your scrolling routine, try to write one and if it works in Nintendulator (although not perfect, the emulator's very accurate), then ask someone to test it on a MMC5 devcart.<br /><br />Hehe, I'm goin for 3 pages <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /><p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sat Dec 25, 2004 10:08 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I meant you can't normally write to the other nametable unless it's swapped in via $5105. Yeah, try to make it look good (and make it easy to read).<br /></div><br />Ah, I undersand now. For example having $11 loaded into $5105 (so inversed vertical mirroiting), write to the PPU nametable will do it exactly the same as a normal vertical mirroiting, right ?<br />So here you are my guess :<br />While walking/staying on normal fieldscreen, mirroiting is single ($00) and no midframe changes will ocurs, ExGrafix are enabled via $5104.<br />Scince a box message opens (one who can be scrooled), the mirroiting is turned into vertical ($44) and all data is written to the segond name table.<br />When all data is written, the midframe IRQ will be enabled, and the mirroiting will turn back to 1-screen mirroiting in VBlank.<br />When an IRQ occurs at box's begining scanline-1 (this scanline will change to make a cool effect like FF1, CT, etc...), wait for HBlank with a few nops.<br />Then I have to :<br />-Turn off ExGrafix rendering (write 2 to $5104) scince the text box should not be affected by the bg's attribut in the other name table.<br />-Change horizontal scrooling to #$00 (may the vertical one should also be changed).<br />-Change mirroiting for #$55 or (only the segond name table is shown)<br />-Wait for the end of boxes with timed code or something<br />-Change mirroiting again for #$00 (1-screen mirroiting)<br />-Re-set the horizonzal scrooling to it's original value<br />-Turn on back ExGrafix rendering (write 1 to $5104)<br />So scince all data is written to the segond nametable, the screen will be able to scroll again with 1-screen mirroiting, and the segond nametable won't be affected (it'll just be shown midframe).<br />The only problem is that the segond name table shold be write only once at time, so for example a long message would stop scrooling evertime you need to change the text.<br />Tell me if you found something wrong.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />It's actually a real fun game even though it has Disney characters. I think it's an intresting combination that was actually done well.<br /></div><br />It's just a awfull crap stuff.  I like disney and I like Square, but both CAN'T go together. Don't talk about it anymore, please.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I personally think the games will get much better. FF1 and 2 remakes for the playstation was actually pretty amazing<br /></div><br />I can't know scince they're not released in europe, but the game boy version will be released in europe. I play to FF1 and 2 in NES emulators anyways.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Wouldn't be simple, but prolly be needed.<br /></div><br />Yeah, I guess it would be needed only on the over-world map.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Just set the bank number of a certain area of PPU space to the CHR-ROM bank you need.

If many does, I could try push up my CHR size to 512kb (actually for now it's only 16kb, heh)<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />So don't worry about $5800 and just write any normal scroll routine and I'm sure someone has an MMC5 devcart to test it on<br /></div><br />I'll watch how Just Breed scrooling code's works hardwarely not for $5800, but for PPU and ExRam writes, and MMC5 registers such as $5104.<br />I hope someone could test my game, but I've to be sad to don't test it myself, but I've to found a MMC5 game with SRAM and it's very hard to found in europe. I actually don't know if thoose Koei games are relased in europe (hum, Gemfire and Napoléon-L'empreur happens in england-france so they "should" be released here...)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Dec 25, 2004 3:54 am</p><hr />
