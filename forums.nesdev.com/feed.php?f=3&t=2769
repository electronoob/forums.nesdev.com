For board classes that are not capable of taking more than one ROM chip, FF-pad the CHR ROM to the next 8 KiB boundary. The PRG ROM is more difficult, as the CPU expects the reset vector to be in the bank mapped to $Fxxx, which a lot of boards fix to the last bank in PRG. For this, <em>replicate</em> the last 16 KiB PRG bank until the next power of 2.

This same issue comes up with the various game music file formats, what data to use for unspecified bytes and what multiple the data is mirrored to banks beyond the end. The dispute seems to be over what to do when the last n bytes of a PRG/CHR ROM are all filled with the byte $FF. One party suggests to leave it, since it uses very little hard disk space uncompressed, and just a few bytes if the file is compressed in some way (note that compression can be considered part of the filing system implementation, thus compressing an iNES file is not making it a non-iNES file, just adding another layer of representation). The other party suggests that these bytes be removed and an emulator guess at the correct size, presumably a power of two, and reconstruct this removed data. One problem with this approach is that it assumes that <em>all</em> NES cartridges have a power of two PRG and CHR size.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Wed Nov 29, 2006 6:31 pm</p><hr />

In reality, few if any licensed or unlicensed games use less than 8k of PRG ROM nor do they address banks in smaller granularity than 8k (except for NSF?) Having 16k iNES PRG banks still allows for theoretical unlicensed games which have one small PRG ROM (256Kbit) and one big PRG ROM (2Mbit) or something without having to pad. Since we now know there are FC games with 64Kbit PRG ROM, Marat should have chosen 8k banks for PRG. Perhaps he already knew this but used 16k banks since he knew of 32Mbit unlicensed games and didn't want to extend the PRG ROM size to more than 8 bits.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Is hard drive space still cheap if you are building an adapter to read CF or SD memory cards into a pair of PSRAMs on an NES cart board?<br /></div><br />Yes seeing how a single memory card can now hold an uncompressed single good dump of at least every licensed game for at least NTSC regions.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Wed Nov 29, 2006 3:51 pm</p><hr />

Under my interpretation of your interpretation, no games work when compressed with PKZIP because the NES hardware cannot directly read PKZIP data. Replicating the last bank of CHR from the end of the file to the end of the address space (for example in a 112 KB CHR on an S*ROM board, replicating the last 4 KiB up to 128 KiB) is just a means of compression.<br /><br />If trimmed roms are forbidden, then why does the iNES format store the number of banks and not the base 2 logarithm of the number of banks?

Assume you have a 40KB game on a 128KB ROM, you could trim the empty banks, causing emulators to probably interpret it as the nearest power of 2: a 64KB ROM. If the game switches to an empty bank on the 2nd 64KB part eg. as a protection mechanism, it would fail on an emulator.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=115">hap</a> — Wed Nov 29, 2006 2:41 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Because that appears to be the responsibility of the emulator.<br /></div><br /><br />Apparently.  It's something I've been meaning to accomidate for in my emu anyway since some ROM hackers expand CHR but don't necessarily bump it up to the next power-of-2 size.  (*thinks of Mario Adventure*)<br /><br />Regardless, it's still not behavior I would encourage for homebrew developers or ROM hackers.  I'm still of the opinion that (barring special circumstances, like multiple chips; e.g.  Action 52) PRG/CHR/RAM should maintain a clean power-of-2 size.<br /><br />But like I said -- it's not like I'm saying he's in the wrong -- it's just something I thought I'd bring up.  Whatever the case, I've just "fixed" this in my emu so the demo works even with its $11 CHR size.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />You'll notice that the common dumps of <em>Smash TV</em> and <em>Tetris 2</em> also have undersize CHR.<br /></div><br /><br />Apparently I don't have those dumps (or deleted them in favor of the [!] dumps -- which have power-of-2 sizes).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Wed Nov 29, 2006 11:41 am</p><hr />
