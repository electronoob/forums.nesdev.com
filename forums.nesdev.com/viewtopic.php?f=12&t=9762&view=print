		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If the cartridges are the same numbers, then the roms can be swapped between them.  But the roms are mask roms and if they are more than 32 pins, then they are larger than 8m bit ( which is a common EPROM )   Because they are mask Roms, they don't have a standard EPROM pinout so some rewiring would have to be done .... Or ....... If you search for &quot;tsop adapters&quot; you can read up on how these can solve the mask rom size and pin out issues.  If you don't want to go the tsop route, then it is possible to do what you want via cartridge adapters.  But the tsop is the preferred way in my opinion.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_OEUKEEs_E&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_OEUKEE ... ata_player</a><!-- m -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />All commercial SNES games use PCBs that do not accept standard DIP EPROMs. You have to rewire or use an adapter. If you are not experienced in soldering, this isn't really a beginner's project. If you have some experience it isn't too hard but there is a difference in getting it done and getting it done cleanly. If you just have interest in playing the games on a real console you should checkout reprogrammable cartridges like the PowerPAK and Super EverDrive.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually that board you posted has two MaskROMs and that top chip is an 8 kilobyte SRAM chip. <br /><br />Many games use one MaskROM but some use two and some use three. I'm not aware of any game that uses four. The reason they would use more than one MaskROM is likely related to production issues/costs at the time. <br /><br />You are right that 32pin MaskROMs for SNES are 8 megabits max. 36pin MaskROMs also exist in larger sizes. I think in theory they can be up to 64 megabits. And yes you must do some rewiring to place a EPROM on a retail PCB. Someone however realized a while back that by swapping data around in the file you can avoid many signals needing to be rewired as the signals were address lines which just has to do with where it gets data from in the ROM. So by moving it in the file you can avoid moving the electrical signals. But not all rewiring can be avoided. I think if you swap the data in an 8 megabit eprom you only have to rewire 2 pins. However it is important to point out that many SNES games are larger than 8 megabits yet there is no suitable DIP EPROM or Flash bigger than 8 megabits. Other memories aren't dip and can route the signals however they need so no rewiring is needed.<br /><br />One last note about the number of chips in carts. Earlier Donkey Kong Country cartridges have two 16mbit MaskROMs where as the later Player's Choice release has a single 32mbit MaskROM. A popular game, Street Fighter II' Turbo atleast in some production runs actually has 3 MaskROMs. Two 8mbit and one 4mbit for 20mbits of data.

That adapter has a max capacity of 32mbits (4 8m roms).   The nature of mask roms is to achieve a higher capacity of memory albeit in a non standard format.  That was one of my first projects with Nintendo cartridges before I learned about the Tsop adapters.......and now that I've learned to solder and remove the tsop parts, the adapter shown in that video just collects dust on the shelf.   If I have a game that only requires 1 or 2 roms (8m or 16m), then I may use it and save the 32m tsop adapters for the bigger game files.
