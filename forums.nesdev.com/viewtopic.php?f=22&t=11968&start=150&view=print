The first message that appeared after dying a lot of times was a nice surprise, and I immediately sought them all out for their story elements.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">the 2nd and 3rd <em>[messages that appear after you die a lot of times]</em> are more like tips for people who haven't read the manual.</div>I remember being surprised by 2nd message's tip to press SELECT at the starting screen to access the options, because that wasn't mentioned in the PDF manual. I now see it's in the text file, but how will players of the cartridge version know there are options available at the starting screen?<br /><br />Also in the PDF manual: It bothered me a little that both of the map pages mention the direction <em>west</em> in their descriptions to refer to something on the left side of the page, because when you flip between the sides, the &quot;west&quot; from one description is a different side of the world than the &quot;west&quot; from the other description.

The manuals were actually printed before I implemented that menu for the title screen, so I wanted to get that message into the game.<br /><br />Whether the word west or east is confusing in the manual... I dunno, I don't think there are common terms with a precise and accurate meaning that I could apply to a space like this which is topologically different from the real world. So... I chose &quot;west&quot; for left, and &quot;east&quot; for right, on either map. That this bothered you at least indicates that you have figured out for yourself how this world is <em>really</em> shaped.<br /><br />I also considered something like &quot;toward the edge&quot; and &quot;toward the fold&quot; to give a hint about the nature of these maps, but I felt like that was even more confusing. On the other hand, if I had said just &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;, I felt these words were similarly inadequate to east/west.<br /><br /><br />At this point I plan to leave the manual as it is.

It sounds like gauauu and I took roughly the same path. <br /><br />Without spoiling anything (and I don't think I've got far enough to spoil much) I got that ending and it reset, but then I discovered something which made me think I might want to keep the password and carry on using that game, rather then reset everything.<br /><br />If that's the case, you might want to leave some kind of hint at that moment, as the ending made me think I should start from scratch. Unless there is one in the text, and I just overlooked it.<br /><br />Also, yes, brutally difficult! Great enemy interaction though.<br /><br />Finally,  I like the structure of it and appreciate the save points - but if its tough both backwards and forwards it can feel like they tie you to a certain place in a bit of death loop. Maybe the option to warp back to the main first point from a save point? Similar to the reset function? Although I appreciate that suggestions like this late in the day sometimes aren't exactly helpful.<br /><br />Still very much enjoying the game and we'll be cracking on with it today. Oh, and the map and overall world design is awesome - were going to start drawing a map today, and I can't wait.

Difficulty isn't just some single monolithic quantity where some people want more and some people want less. Every element of is is an individual case with special meaning. There are things in my game that I think are difficult in ways that are worthwhile and fun, and other things that I think are difficult in ways that are <em>not</em>.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I tend to theorize in this matter quite a bit after so many years of playing and designing games. I have a very personal opinion about this: it's fine that it's difficult as long as it is fair, and fair means that a situation is difficult for you *only* because you don't have the required skill, a skill you can get solely by practice. When the difficulty comes from &quot;chance&quot;, it's not fair. And this covers a wide spectrum, including situations where you as the player are not in complete control due to poor design.<br /><br />If the required amount of practice is too high for your standards, then the game is simply too difficult for <em>you</em>. This brings a new matter: as long as &quot;chance&quot; is not involved in difficulty, the game designer should decide on which audience he or she is focusing. And nowadays the amount of people who have the time or will to master your game no matter how hard it is is low, sadly.<br /><br />So I find it interesting if you are a bit forgiving in your game until the point that your players get hooked. Then, you make the learning curve steeper. Letting the players get some achievements in their first go is a good idea.<br /><br />There's a very famous game in Spain, released in 1985 for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. The game is called Abu Simbel Profanation and it was a blast back in the 80s, when people had access to less games and tended to persevere more. Nowadays, this game would have been a complete bluff just because it took you dozens of tries before you could even get past the first enemy. Once you got past the first screen, the game felt much easier and really got you hooked. That's bad design, in my book.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to this game to be released and I hope I can purchase my copy even though I wasn't around for the kickstarter campaign.

I don't think there's much good reason for me to do so, but a SNES or Genesis port <em>might</em> be a fun learning project for me. The DOS one would just be a nostalgia trip: I cut my teeth on DJGPP.

Perhaps emulating the game but HLEing the audio?

But you'd probably need to improve color depth somewhat and arrange the music and sound effects for the double polyphony and sampler mentality of the S-DSP. If you don't feel like getting your hands dirty in SPC700 assembly language (which is a 65C02 in drag), there are a few pre-built homebrew audio drivers, such as SNES GSS.
