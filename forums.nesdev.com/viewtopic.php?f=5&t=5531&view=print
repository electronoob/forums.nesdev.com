		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, we all know the names of some game designers, such as Shigeru Miyamoto, Keiji Inafune, etc. some composers such as Koji Kondo, Nobuo Uematsu, etc. But what about the programmers? It seems like we don't know the names of all the talented programmers who made the classic games. Or, perhaps I don't. Which is more likely. It'd be fun if they would make an appearance on this website and tell us a few things.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />End credits became much more common during the 16-bit era due in part to an emphasis on "completion" over "high scores" and a larger ROM size, but some NES games had room for end credits (e.g. TMNT 2 and 3). EA games from the ■●▲ era, such as <em>Skate or Die 2</em>, put credits front and center: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8TmIxHSBcU" class="postlink">Bunch/Knopp/Kosaka</a>. But i'd expect that most programmers of 8-bit games published by Capcom/Konami/Nintendo are either native speakers of Japanese or bound by non-disclosure agreements or both.

<br />Many games shows pseudonymes instead of actual names as credits (Mega Man comes in mind), but there is plenty of them who actually have full credits like Contra.

<br />Well I didn't know his name either and I probably won't remember it anyways. Uematsu and Mitsuda are probably the only japanese names I remember probably because they show up on so many albums I bought, I wouldn't remember them only by looking at Rad Racer 2's credits trough.

<br />
<br />Reminds me of Bruce Dickinson -- everyone knows him as the vocalist for Iron Maiden, but what a lot of people/fans don't know is that he's a pilot, fences, and is an avid train enthusiast.  I suppose all of that's well-known now with Wikipedia and all, but "back in the day" it was always something you'd hear from some roadie or something.
<br />
<br />I knew about the first two things, but not his interest in trains -- until one day while watching a multi-hour segment on locomotives on the Discovery Channel, they started interviewing Bruce.  I was amazed.

<br />
<br />AFAIK, yes he did.  I have a vague memory of a chance-meeting with someone in the metro-Detroit area, who claimed to be Nasir.  He asked me if I knew of Final Fantasy, and if I recalled the first bridge.  When I responded positively, he then said that he, indeed, was Nasir.  I was amazed, especially since I assumed that all that work would have to have been done by an entire company (named NASIR for some reason <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />).  My memory is extremely vague because I can't have been ten at the time.  From what I remember, he may indeed have been Iranian-American, and was probably bald at the time.  I can't remember many details, but I would like to think that I actually shook hands with the guy who brought life to a world that captured my imagination as a child.
<br />
<br />EDIT:  Or maybe it was someone else who was involved with FF...  I just get confused when I try to remember more details.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />
