		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello,
<br />
<br />My Serial CopyNES died on my (fried I believe when I tried flipping a switch on a game with the power on.. :( ) And I decided to replace it with a USB CopyNES..
<br />
<br />Now it works fine for the most part, but some games it simply cannot run.  Action 52 in particular won't load up in the USB CopyNES, whereas I had previously been able to load and dump it with the Serial one.  On the USB CopyNES with Action 52 in it, the power light just flashes on and then back off.  The game still plays fine in a regular NES.  I am also having some trouble with a Sachen Game (2 in 1 tough cop / super tough cop) where the game will boot but skips the title screen and looks all scrambled.  This is all in trying to play the 2 games on the USB CopyNES, not yet dumping them to ROM.
<br />
<br />Anyone have an idea that might cause this behavior?  Does the implementation drain some of the NES's power so it might not have enough left for Action 52 or something or might there be a problem with the original NES I used, or my implementation?
<br />
<br />Has anyone encountered this type of issue, or is it just me?
<br />
<br />Thanks for any advice!

<br />I've had other common unlicensed cause the CopyNES to crash due to crazy antics invloved in stunning the system, but would usually work on the next try.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I was able to dump the Sachen game on the Serial version, but it took some doing to figure out which plugins to use, and it would only dump as unif format with a strange boardname I can't remember at the moment that wasn't the actual board it used.  What happened to give me *real* trouble was that the cartridge had a switch on it (like those Camerica carts do, but accessible from the front) and I stupidly went and flipped this switch when the CopyNES was on.  After I did this, it immediatly powered off and wouldn't power on anymore so I assume I blew something.
<br />
<br />With my new USB CopyNES, it runs all jarbled, and only for a few seconds and then hangs.  I never even got as far as to try to dump it.
<br />
<br />Good to know you are able to use the USB version with Action 52 though, that means I am going to go and recheck my implementation.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well me being me, I just couldn't let sleeping dogs lie and I tried running this sachen game again in the USB CopyNES (without screwing with the switch this time), and I seem to have fried it yet again..
<br />
<br />So, I am wondering what the heck happened to it:  Currently the symptoms I see are such:
<br />
<br />This CopyNES had been working quite well for me, I dumped 90 or so games with it so far.
<br />
<br />When I played this Sachen game in the USB CopyNES (just playing it out to TV, no dumping) it behaved strangely (garbled graphics) and then after a few seconds it died out.  Then, the unit won't power on anymore with any game, or with no game, usb cord plugged or unplugged.. Pressing the power, produces no power light and no output.  There is still the characteristic clicking of the speakers when I hit the power button though.
<br />
<br />The unit is still recognized by windows when I plug the usb cable in, but always as powered off...
<br />
<br />Looking at the board, I can see no obvious signs of any damage.
<br />
<br />Likely, I could move the board to another NES successfully, but I'm not 100% convinced whether the Sachen game is actually causing the whole problem, and I would love to find out what happened.
<br />
<br />Anybody have any ideas how I might be able to Salvage it, or at least figure out what went wrong (besides me being a dumbass and trying to run the same game that fried my last copynes)?  I promise not to try to run the game in it again! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />btw, bootgod I did read that thread re the Namco 106, but for a few reasons, I didn't think the read conflict referred to there was causing my problems:
<br />- This game actually did run once before my first copynes died, and I was able to make a successful dump from that time
<br />- It didn't sound to me that the read conflicts you described would cause a permanent problem (although I admit my knowledge of the copynes workings is probably too limited to make that assumption)
<br />- The problem seems to be caused/worsened by a particular switch setting on this cart, the adapter setting (there are three settings: old, new, and adapter. 
<br />- Before the crash this time, I had seen some similar behavior when using other more standard unlicensed carts (Exodus Journey comes to mind) that were temporary only until I unplugged the USB cable from the unit.

<br />
<br />In the future, you might want to pull that crap out of your carts (if you don't care about their value), or disconnect any lockout-related lines leading to the cart inside the NES, before attempting to dump them.

<br />
<br />I would like to protect the next Unit from this type of damage rather than trying to pull the parts off the individual carts.  Do the carts not need to communicate with the lockout chip to function properly?

<br />Also: I was able to dump my Action 52 game after this change, so obviously the issue I was having with that was not a Serial vs. USB Issue.
