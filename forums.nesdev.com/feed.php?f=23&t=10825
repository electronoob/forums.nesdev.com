Unlicensed NES game developers had to do the same things. Starting with only ROM pinouts, they dumped old NROM games, looked at the bytes, realized it was 6502, and followed from the reset vector to see what was going on.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Tue Jun 17, 2014 8:01 pm</p><hr />

We know that the Gameking uses a 65C02. We don't know how the game writes configures the sound hardware, or how it works, or where in memory it is. We don't know how the display is accessed, configured, or anything else. We don't know how it accesses the more-than-64KiB of data on the cartridge, or how it reads the joypad.<br /><br />All of this information can be determined either from the manufacturer, looking at existing games, or by exhaustively trying tests until it does something, in order of increasing frustration but also accuracy.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Tue Jun 17, 2014 7:10 pm</p><hr />

I don't understand.<br />How to start any other unknown emulator project?<br />The person who dumped and connected it, knows the software, the game. And can test and compare it. Otherwise it won't be possible to write any emulator for unknown stuff. Or need for in-circuit testing?<br /><br />The ROM data consists of 6502 code, GFX and sound and maybe some other data and logic tables.<br />If you have the GFX, what is the case and can also extract the uncompressed music and sound (not done yet?), the rest must be the gaming code what is probably very few parts of the data.<br /><br />There are some more bytes now dumped than the length of the previously known original header from Brian but the few bytes look like some more GFX, maybe a logo, and the few bytes don't help much. <br />I have to check the data with Brian's GFX tool and compare to 6502 code.<br />Dumping is the first step. And identifying and extracting the complete GFX and sound is very important. Even if you don't have the code, you can try to simulate and play with the GFX.<br />GFX encryption is fully known, Sound should be uncompressed  6 KHz. What else is needed?<br /><br />At least he managed to dump them. Knows the correct PIN layout, dumping software using an Arduino and some more details previously not known.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6315">Gamekin</a> — Tue Jun 17, 2014 12:25 pm</p><hr />

Now Porchy from JAMMArcade.net has dumped some games. He owns 13 games, looks like no multi carts.<br /><br />He used female (?)  jumper wires to attach to the slot pins and 74HC4040. To me it doesn't look like if they are enough wires. And on the upper slot pins row he has 2 rows of jumpers attached, I wonder how he had managed that (PINS bent? Soldered?) Oh, I forgot. There are 4 rows.<br /> But he claims to have dumps and saw all the game graphics. Nothing much shown other than the previously known header data.<br /><br />He also doesn't have released the ROM contents and he obviously can't write an emulator.<br /><br />But there is at least hope, that he donates the ROM data to MESS or somewhere else.<br /><br />If I had detailed schematics, complete PIN layout and dumping software, I maybe retry it with my multicarts or maybe send my carts. But without an emulator it doesn't make much sense, except for having all graphics and maybe find the sound data.<br /><br />Does anybody know him? Or can post this on the MESS forum?<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.jammarcade.net/dumping-gameking-cartridges/">http://www.jammarcade.net/dumping-gameking-cartridges/</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6315">Gamekin</a> — Tue Jun 17, 2014 2:52 am</p><hr />

I now made a simulation using openBOR about my favourite game galled Terminator what is a Double Dragon clone.

And the platformers can also be made quite easily. The 194x shooters are very simple and I don't like them.<br />It's not the same as real emulating but it's at least possible to have a feeling what the console, some games and sound is like.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6315">Gamekin</a> — Sat Mar 01, 2014 7:37 am</p><hr />

I put that to GND (using a resistor). After that the FTDI board wasn't recognized anymore. No COM port. <br />Device Manager code 43 (Unknown device). I read that could mean that the front USB hub was busted But I also checked the rear one and on a different PC).<br /><br />I tried to remove and reinstall the drivers automatically and manually and tried every FTDI tool including deleting the vendor ID. It could also have been destroyed for some other reason.<br />If I had a working code at the beginning, it might have been worked.<br /><br />Thanks to everybody who tried to help.<br /><br />Maybe I will find someone who has more skills and some hardware or maybe there will be someone else who read this and trying it himself.<br />Even if I had a dump, someone said that writing an emulator would be extremely difficult.<br /><br />I currently trying to write a simulator of my favourite game.<br />First I tried it for Gameboy. But I had problems with the map tool. Always displayed wrong. Music and sound effects would also be a problem on the GB. Many tools disappeared. I tried some software on the C64. But it's also quite difficult and slowly. Shooters could maybe be written using SEUCK. Or it's possible just changing the GFX and sprites from other games.<br />Currently I'm using tools on Windows.

The arduino interface to upload code uses the same serial port, right?
