<br />You mean emulator<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">s</span></strong>. Even if I don't count my own, which is fairly fast but sucks compability-wise, there are still at least 3 others that I know of.

That's when the top display went out.<br />Plus the shoulder buttons and the hinges went out in less than a year from purchasing it.  I don't even want to mention the finish, but I guess I just did. It's all worn off from my rough hands.<br />What the hell Nintendo? Paint doesn't go on gaming consoles. Especially portable systems.<br />The hardware uberly sucks. The button interface and everything is just so awkward. Even in the DS lite. Them things are too friggin' small. I have an easier time holding my Aspire One as a Gameboy. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The only PC NDS emulator available doesn't run at full-speed on my PC</div><br /><br />What do you mean "The only PC NDS emulator"? I found a few emulators for PC.  I'm not going to mention any names but I found an emulator for DS that runs nicely. Didn't seem to support audio though, A bit crappy to. I understand it's latest release is supposedly  more compatible. It's site is down though. So I didn't get it. I'm sure you know which emu I'm talking about. It's the best one out there. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">blame yourself for the cash you're loosing because you had to take wisely care of it.</div><br /><br />I really wouldn't mind paying the cash, The DS is pretty cheap. But as I said, The hardware sucks. I blame the hardware and myself. Well, I blame myself slightly. I took pretty good care of it though. I even got The DS backpack for it and some backup styluses for when they'd wear out.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">atari2600a wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But you're going to back up your carts yourself, RIGHT!? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> </div>

<br /> Yes I will.

<br />
<br />Actually the Some$ForTheNewestVersion emulator works pretty nice when it comes to 2D games even on a mediocre hardware.
<br />Games that push the hardware/use lots of 3D are another thing (Core2 very much recommended).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's funny...I've had my DS for a few years now, played it like hell, and it still works great to this day. There are noticeable shiny spots near the buttons where my thumbs rest, but that's to be expected. The thing's built like a tank (unlike my new PSP, which would probably crack if I so much as looked at it wrong). Maybe you need to handle your hardware a little more carefully? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />As for the "awkward" interface, you can get handle grips (at least for the "phat" model) that attach to the back of the system that greatly improve its comfort and usability.

<br />Grip things? 
<br />Damn, did anyone notice Nintendo's newer generation of consoles? They are just built all wrong, button mashing has been a pain in the ass.
<br />
<br />Btw, BMF54123; what size are your hands anyway? I think my problem is just the size of my hands. Look at my hand holding a Wiimote.
<br />The remote looks a little bigger than usual, which is odd. but check anyway.

<br />And for the DS being built like a tank: the hinge cracked within the first year. I think the odd thing is is that the screens still look new, I saw a kid get one and the display looked like it got in a fight with a mob of cats.
