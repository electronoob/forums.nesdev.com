With my idea it could be realized with about ~4 discrete chip I guess. If you do only that then it's a waste of a CPLD, but if you combine that with a MMC3-class or even a simpler MMC1-class mapper then it's definitely no waste.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It just sounds like a waste of space to dedicate the an entire 1KB to attributes, while all you really need is 240 bytes. Couldn't we use the rest of this memory as a name table for status bars or something?</div><br />Well I'd take simple (identical to Name Table) addressing over a complicated bit scheme that is extremely annoying to go by, and very unsuited to the little 6502 CPU which can only shift one register one bit at a time... With ARM the attribute tables of the NES wouldn't be so much of a pain <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />But I think it might be possible to have 8x2 attributes by divinding the byte in the neo-attribute-table into four regions of 2 pixels height, each one having it's own 2 bits. This would definitely require a CPLD, as it'd need highacking the data line of the CHR-RAM in very specific fashion.

The row would be whatever the pattern address is, masked with 7.<br /><br />The pattern fetch occurs after the attribute fetch though, so you'd be relying on the previous tile's patterns, which would work because the BG will always render the same row over and over for a single scanline, unless you split the screen (in which the tile immediately after the split may not have the correct attribute row). However, the leftmost tile of the screen will always have the wrong attribute row (it'll always be row 7, unless the scanline has 8 sprites on it, in which case it'll depend on the 8th sprite's Y position), and the only <em>simple</em> fix I can think of is to use the PPU's 8-pixel mask to hide the glitch.<br /><br />Less-simple fixes would be tile counting like MMC5, or sprite pattern fetch vs bg pattern fetch like the MMC3, but it'd depend on whether being able to show the leftmost column of BG tiles is worth all the circuitry necessary to compensate for the glitch.

The most obvious translation of the TMS9918 display model, which uses a separate pair of colors per 8x1 sliver, would provide eight rows of attribute for each tile, not each nametable entry.

That would actually make scrolling FASTER, since you wouldn't have to worry about attributes at all, at the expense of slower pattern updates (18 bytes per tile instead of 16... for background tiles anyway, since sprites wouldn't use these attribute bits) and duplicate tiles for the ones that would normally use palette swaps (which is more common on sprites than background, anyway).<br /><br />Interesting idea, but is it possible, though? You don't have the pattern address yet when attributes are fetched, only the tile index.

This might be cool for cutscenes, but wouldn't make much sense in a game that scrolls, unless the game was able to turn this on an off, making the mapper even more complex.<br /></div><br />Honnestly a solution I find just as viable would be to have the attribute/colour data depend on the tile number itself, rather than it's position on the screen. That way attributes would be linked to pattern tables instead of name tables. I belive that'd fix this problem, but it would not be possible to re-use a tile for different palettes across the screen.<br /><br />We could even use CHR-ROM for this, since you're likely to want to have some bunch of tiles always having the same palette everywhere in the game. By banking different CHR-ROM in a particular place that'd change which tiles uses which colour. Pretty cool, no? Of course that'd kill all the simplicity, as already said.<br /><br />As for sacrifying half of CIRAM for fined attributes I think it makes sense because if you have finer attribute you can scroll with single-screen mirroring with no glitches, so a second nametable is only needed for a status bar or special effects. But many games do not necessary need status bars, a few sprites can be enough to display information.

I asked about telling $0XXX and $1XXX apart, but now I realize that's not necessary, just use the tile index and it will work for both pattern tables.<br /><br />I don't think that giving up on palette swaps in the same screen is such a big problem, specially since you can still do it with sprites.<br /><br />I also liked your CHR-ROM idea. Loading the extended attributes automatically along with the tiles is a nice advantage.
