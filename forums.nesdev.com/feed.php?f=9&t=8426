There are plenty of small fab company in China that do small runs for ALOT less<br />than that. I've had my hands on my pcbs from these places for the atari machines (2600, 7800 &amp; 5200). Prices ranged from<br />around $1.25 to $5 a board pending the size of the board and how many are ordered. If you get a few hundred boards made<br />the price is pretty darn cheap if you plan on selling at least enough to cover the costs of the boards (not talking about the cash<br />value of the persons time to draw the pcb as thats a totally different monster). Hell I have got them by the box full in the past<br />with 9 boards per sheet. Silk screened logos the whole 9, but I just paid for them, I didn't do the gerber files as I'm not good<br />with gerber\egale\whatever software to draw the board and it's layers.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3870">nintendo2600</a> — Wed Aug 28, 2013 8:55 pm</p><hr />

Ninja Gaiden MMC3 is about 95% complete. Need to figure how to have the text for both the cutscenes and the in-game hud, to display correctly. The text shows up as whatever tiles are stored currently in the ppu, they get fetched from somewhere else in the rom. Its been a long time since ive worked with something like this. I had to rewrite how $8000-$8001 read gaiden's chr setup. But when I try to have 2 sets of routines, the in-game palette fade in gets stuck in a weird loop, and the chr routine doesnt work. This is the only issue left with this game from becoming a full MMC3 port.<br /><br />EDIT - Freak luck, I was able to get the text to appear for the cutscenes. <br /><br />Now im still trying to decypher in-game co-existences of 2 chr setups, very difficult.<br /><br />EDIT #2 - Making progress, found a workaround but it aint pretty looking code wise, but its being allowed to work and display. Hoping by tonight or tomorrow to have it finished.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5898">infidelity</a> — Wed Jul 24, 2013 4:00 am</p><hr />

Another test (i'm going crazy here).<br />I replaced Megaman 1,2,4,6 with castlevania mmc3. Castlevania works perfectly, no matter wich one i start.<br />Now i only replaced megaman 1,2 and 4 with Castlevania mmc3. Castlevania starts, but after the intro (when he enters the gate), i get a black screen, no matter wich game i select.<br />Next I replaced Megaman 1,2 and 6 with castlevania mmc3. Castlevania works perfectly, no matter wich one i start.<br />So, it's something wrong with my wiring or with the menu?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4692">gorgyrip</a> — Wed Jul 24, 2013 3:52 am</p><hr />
