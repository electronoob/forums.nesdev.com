Make sure you can complete the game. You'll need enough money to pay your programmers, artists, composers, and quality control for any game larger in scope than the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/26/16368178/steam-shovelware-removed-asset-flipping" class="postlink">low-effort &quot;fake games&quot; that have become common on Steam</a>.<br />1b. Ensure your game works on a wide variety of PCs, with both integrated and discrete GPUs, and all supported versions of Windows (currently 7, 8.1, and 10), as well as at least one of GNU/Linux or macOS. Porting to more than one PC operating system and having a low-detail option help keep your game flexible enough to reach a wide range of devices.<br />2a. Consider forming an LLC or S corporation. This costs a bit but helps to manage risk in certain scenarios involving errors and omissions. If you go this route, you'll need a bank account and tax ID for your company.<br /><br />If you're just starting out, you might be able to make up these costs by first selling smaller games on Itch before Steam, as <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=174937#p174937" class="postlink">rainwarrior recommended</a>, as Itch has smaller setup fees.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: Pyramid style (summary up front, then details); remove suggestion to try to publish on PlayStation 4 in parallel

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A post edited before others reply doesn't get the edit date. A post edited by a user who is an administrator doesn't get the edit date. This behavior of phpBB 3 differs from phpBB 2, which always produces an edit date when a user edits his own post even if he is an administrator. I don't know whether this lack of edit date in phpBB 3 kicks in at administrator, global moderator, or just moderator.<br /><br />Have my edits improved my previous post? Or is it still a mess?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Publishing on itch.io is free and dead easy. Very little to fill out, and no approval process.<br /><br />Publishing on Steam is only a little bit harder than this. There is more to fill out, and if you want to do things like achievements and trading cards or other integration it's a bit of work but still almost trivial compared to any console submission process.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Produce a nontrivial, working game for PC. </li><li>Provide a way to receive revenue, and preferably insulate the game's finances from your own in case the worst happens. </li><li>Fill out the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/steamdirect" class="postlink">Steam Direct</a> form and pay the 100 USD fee. </li></ol></div><br /><br />I don't think all of step 1 is required. There are plenty of trivial games on Steam. I think they do run your executable once just to make sure it runs, but there is really very little oversight with this. Step 2 you need a bank account, and some tax info, but that's about it. You don't have to set up a company for it, you can act as a sole proprietorship in your own name and use your personal bank account and tax information. So really, step 3 is the only step worth mentioning IMO, these details are all available there anyway.<br /><br />If you want to discuss that stuff I said in the other thread that you linked (and then apparently unlinked) I think that's a completely different topic, i.e. publishing on a modern gated console, and the upfront costs of commercial game development (and how Bob took a very wrong approach). BUT STILL even if that <em>was</em> the question, step 1 is still just to make the game. Setting up a corporation or a static IP or saving an arbitrary amount of money etc. is an unimportant detail. All of that can be worked out when you need to, and if you're just starting a game now the specific requirements like that are absolutely going to be different by the time you're finished. Just make the game on a platform you have access to now.
