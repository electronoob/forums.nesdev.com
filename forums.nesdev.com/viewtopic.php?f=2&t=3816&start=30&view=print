And also, we should probably post examples that don't include assembler-based macros. Since the language being learned is the 6502, we should just put plain 6502 pieces up.
<br />
<br />I think we should put a Hello World demo up, just to show how to initialize the NES and whatnot. But we should also have demos showing how to work with the scroll registers, how to do PPU updates, sprites, sound, etc.

<br />So people don't have to learn about the assembler right away. It's just a simple NROM set up for WLA-DX. I don't know really anything about CA65 (Or CC65, I don't know what the difference is if there is any), but it's only because I started learning about WLA-DX and thought it was fine.
<br />
<br />Personally, I don't really want to use macros. I just code in plain 6502 code. And since in the end that's what it's turned into, I think it's kind of annoying to try and go through code that has a bunch of macros so I have to go dinking around looking for the definition of the macros.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No, what is needed is more than "Hey let's put up a tutorial... here's a tutorial". Lots of questions must be answered.
<br />
<br />- What level of knowledge will these assume?
<br />- Will the very first code examples be standalone, or use some kind of shell that hides the details? (this mostly depends on how basic the examples start)
<br />- What assembler will be used?
<br />- There will be marked up examples on the Wiki. Will these be directly assemblable?
<br />- What order will things be introduced in? Each code example should build on the concepts introduced in the last, and not explain them again. So the order is critical to decide on <em>before</em> writing code, since changes in order require lots of rewriting.
<br />
<br />I envision a series of descriptive texts and code to go along with it, starting with basic 6502 instructions and using a shell to print values to a text console. Once 6502 operation is established, then a complete standalone NES ROM is introduced. After that, graphics are covered. Each unit would have text that introduces new concepts, with little bits of code interspersed, along with a runnable code example that puts it all together. ca65 would be used as the assembler. Each unit could be on a separate Wiki page, with the runnable code as a linked file at the end.
<br />
<br />If I'm going to contribute, it will only be with a small number of people (2 or 3 others perhaps), and there will have been planning beforehand, not just charging ahead. I'm interested in something really high quality, or nothing at all. Maybe tepples and I can work on a few trial units, one from the 6502 operation section, and one or two standalone ones. Perhaps making some as a template would allow others to duplicate the format and keep consistency.

<br />
<br />And yes, I agree that it should be really high quality. Otherwise, there's basically no point in making it. My answers to your questions:
<br />
<br />-These should probably assume little programming knowledge. The list of things tepples linked to give a good boost into the basics of programming.
<br />-I don't know exactly what you mean by this...
<br />-ca65, since that is very common around here
<br />-These should be directly assemblable, but perhaps there should be files to download, like graphics files and whatnot.
<br />-The most simple things to start understanding are graphics. After that sound should follow.
<br />
<br />I also think there should be fully compiled test roms at the end of the "lessons" as well as maybe some pictures.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />6502 has to be learned before graphics or sound, since both require lots of setup. Trying to teach 6502 and graphics at the same time is too much; errors in a student's understanding will be hard for him to pinpoint the cause of, since it could be 6502 or NES graphics related. That's why I think there should be several units before NES that focus on 6502 only, and use a shell that has routines like "print the value of A" and "print a message". This allows the tutorial to start with basics like LDA, without the student needing to understand anything else about NES or 6502 operation.

<br />
<br />But yeah, I think we should have some test programs that deal with plain 6502. For example, a loop storing values into RAM. Even though RAM is kind of another field, I think it's safe to combine both of them into the same lesson.
<br />
<br />But yeah, there should definitely be 6502-focused lessons. They will definitely need to come first since everything relating to the NES is in some way involved with 6502.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm posting in this thread because I want to learn this stuff. I don't really care myself about what assembler is used - if you use a particular one (CA65? CC65?) and it works well, there's really no reason to bring up any others. Sticking to only one assembler will probably help reduce confusion. I agree most tutorials, including schoolbooks etc. skip a lot of very important steps a lot of the time. It might be an idea to assume some knowledge about some things but then an explanation for those who don't understand must be readily at hand, and there are few more suitable ways to organize information like this than in a wiki. Rather than printing everything there is to know about everything, those who don't understand can click a link and find a deeper explanation, while those who do understand can read on.
<br />
<br />A better solution is, of course, to explain each step from the beginning and as the examples become more and more advanced, those who don't understand can be reminded about in which example a certain step was brought up the first time, for reference. You should always be able to find what you're looking for though, if you just keeping going backwards in "the book". I feel most tutorials on NES programming have assumed way too much. When I begun doing this stuff I didn't even know about hexadecimals. Sure, it's a not a big deal to learn, but it must be learnt before you can continue, otherwise you'll have no idea what the letters are doing in the numbers, and every hexidecimal number will just look like a random mess.
<br />
<br />Since I don't see how I could be of any other help, I'd be glad to point out where the tutorials could use some more detail, which is sometimes difficult to tell for someone who already knows how something works.

<br />On the NES, audio requires a lot less initialization than video. I'd recommend making the first NES tutorial ding, then have the next few work up to the "da-ding" sound commonly associated with Mario getting a coin.
