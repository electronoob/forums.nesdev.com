		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey there.
<br />
<br />So i recently bought an nes powerpak from retrousb.com and was extremely excited to get it.  I bought a new 4gig lexar compact flash card to use with it, which i formatted to fat32.
<br />
<br />So I put the POWERPAK directory on the root of the flash card, pop it in the Powerpak and put it into my top loader.  Turn on the power and...wait.  The power does not turn on, but stays off.  So i take it out, put it back in and try again.  Flip the power switch, still no power.
<br />
<br />Then I take the Powerpak out, put an officially licensed copy of smb 3 in and the system turns on fine and i can play that game.  wtf?
<br />
<br />So then I think it's the top loader itself.  So i switch to my front loader nes and the same friggin thing happens.
<br />
<br />Is there something I'm missing here?  Or is it just that I got a bad Powerpak unit, you think?
<br />
<br />Any help is appreciated.
<br />
<br />thanks

<br />
<br />It's also possible that the Ciclone isn't functioning properly, though that would not explain the toploader having issues.

<br />
<br />Yeah I'm at a loss for words too. At first I thought it was short on my modded top loader. But after trying it in my front loader I figured the system couldn't be the problem. 
<br />
<br />It's got to be the Powerpak right?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So the power light on the NES just never turns on?
<br />
<br />The only thing I can think of is that Vcc is shorted to ground.  Like mikejmoffitt said there really isn't anything else that could cause that, especially if other games work fine.  
<br />
<br />I would suggest taking the CF card out and trying it incase the short were there somehow.  Even with the CF card removed the NES power light should atleast turn on.  I'd be cautious though, shorting out Vcc to GND can damage the power supply on your NES.  In the end you're probably best to just stop testing it all together to prevent risking breaking your NES, just send it back.

<br />If that doesn't work, i'll also post a video tomorrow showing how it does what it does so everyone can see it in it's mystifying action.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In the front-loader, the LED is lit by the (buffered) output of the CIC; if it's staying off it implies the CIC itself isn't running and something is pulling the line low. The only way I could see that happening is either something funny is shorting it out so it crashes in a no-execute mode.
<br />
<br />Since this is <strong>also</strong> happening with your top loader, it's not exclusively that, and I think it's far more likely that it's a short between power and ground.
<br />
<br />If you smell burning dust, hot components, or chemicals from it while the powerpak is in, the latter is almost certainly the case, and you should <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> attempt to fix it with a larger power supply (especially if you are already using the original nintendo one). Just contact bunnyboy.

<br />As you can see I am using a 1st party nes power supply.
<br />
<br />Perhaps the power supply has some issues?
<br />
<br />I have contacted bunnyboy? from retrousb.com about this issue, so hopefully will have some resolution soon

<br />With the original connector, none of mine do. I did get a replacement connector that is tight enough for carts to work without being pushed down though.
