<br />
<br />
<br />By now every single one of you should know that I'm crazy about the classic Sonic the Hedgehog games for the Mega Drive / Genesis (S1 to S&amp;K) and a few ones on the Master System (don't really care for anything made from '98 onwards). In fact I learned to program back in '97 because I wanted to make my own Sonic game (something that sadly hasn't happened yet).
<br />
<br />Anyway, I'm currently building a platform engine for the NES capable of doing everything one would expect from a classic Sonic game, a kind of mix between the Master System and Mega Drive titles. The problem is that I don't own Sonic, so I can't just use him as if he was mine.
<br />
<br />I know there are tons of fangames featuring Sonic and his friends, but I want to make something I can call "mine" without fearing that the owners of Sonic will someday give me a hard time about my game. I also want to have the option of selling the game (I'd still provide a ROM somehow), something I most certainly can't if I use someone else's character.
<br />
<br />Since the gaming industry is full of clones of other games, I guess it should be safe for me to draw inspiration from the Sonic universe while making an original game. If several companies can make games about strong guys walking down the street kicking and punching people without anyone saying they are ripping off each other, I guess I can make a game about an anthropomorphic animal that runs and spins really fast as long as that animal isn't Sonic, right?
<br />
<br />So I came up with my own character, and he's a cat. I love cats, so that was the most logical choice. Yes, there are cats in Sonic's universe, but I don't care about them because they belong to the new games. Here's a picture of my character (haven't decided on the name yet):
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/cat_small.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />So, let me know what you guys think about this. Is there anyone else facing a dilemma because they want to pay homage to their favorite games? How much do you think we have to change an idea so that it's not considered stealing anymore?

<br />Oh it wasn't sonic on this picture ? I really trough it was until I read that but I'm not a fan of Sega at all so I'm not used to see him. He looks cool anyway so as long as you don't explicitly call him "sonic" and that his sprites aren't ripped from an existing game it will be legal.
<br />
<br />I think there is games that are blatant rip-off of others, like Rad Racer was a rip-off of some sega game, and there was a C64 game "Giana Sisters" or something that was so ripped of SMB that they had to cancel the game, and this makes carts (or was it disks ?) of the game extremely rare.
<br />
<br />PS : Also just like you I've always been learning to programing my own games since the age of ~11. At first I wanted to rip existing games but at ~14 when I really learned serious programming I wanted to make a Final Fantasy clone, but without ripping anything from Final Fantasy. I still want to do that (on the NES) and still haven't released any "simpler" games <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />So I think it's normal that as a kid you want to rip off games, and later you actually want to create your own stuff without ripping anything.

<br />When I started programming I spent hours looking for graphics to rip using emulators. That is indeed in the past, but my desire to make a true Sonic game remains. Maybe it's stronger than ever, since SEGA has disappointed me several times with games that have nothing of what I like, my wish to see a game with the elements I do like just grows stronger.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here is an idea... Release a free fan game that is just a NES version of a pre-existing sonic game to showcase your engine and get the interest of Sonic fans. Then sell a new game that is more than a Sonic clone, but has new features never seen before in a sonic game and can be veiwed as an original/novel appoarch to that genre. There have been plenty of sonic imitators (Bubsy, Speedy Gonzales, ect...) but they all failed to capture what made sonic fun and failed introduce anything new to the genre.
<br />
<br />Personally I would not be interested in buying something that is simply a clone of sonic, but I would gladly pay for something that takes a fresh spin on Sonic. I would also rather not have a downloadable rom of the game released till some time has passed or a sequel is made (A free rom download could be used to advertise the sequel <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />)
<br />
<br />P.S. Plus a free NES sonic game should please those not willing or able to buy a new NES game :p

I never owned any sega console and I never played any game featuring sonic so I really know nothing about him.
<br />
<br />And yes of course if you come with your own protagonist but rip everything else it's still ripping. But as long as you don't rip anything, there is really nothing to worry about - they can own sonic and related characters, but they don't own game physics, or a gameplay system.  Even if those two looks really close to Sonic games - that would not make your game a sonic game. Also I suspect Sonic to has started as a rip off of Mario games in the first place (but I might be completely wrong).

No matter how great it is, it almost always end up decaying and becoming a piece of shit.<br /><br />This can be easily seen with Final Fantasy games, which I'm a great fan of. The recently released FF13 on PS3 looks amazing graphically (that's a good thing) but the gameplay isn't quite Final Fantasy looking anymore (that's not a good thing) altough I think it's still much better than the previously releaed FF12 on PS2. The only series which have never decayed since the NES is the Catlevania series. Almost all games in the series are masterpieces, and this still applies to games released recently. Altough there is still black sheeps in the series, I think mostly of Game Boy's Casltevania titles which are mediocre at best, but still had very awesome music like all CV games have.<br /><br /> <br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Personally I would not be interested in buying something that is simply a clone of sonic, but I would gladly pay for something that takes a fresh spin on Sonic.

<br />You know there is people on this forum that don't think only about money and advertisement. We are nes developpers, not buisness managers. But we already debated arround this and I don't want this again.

For instance there is <a href="http://www.piersolar.com/" class="postlink">Pier Solar</a>. This game has renewed many ppl's interest in the Genesis and ppl have even been buying Sega CDs and Genesis' in order to play this game. I ordered Pier Solar the instant preorders were available. Tokumaru expressed an interest in selling his game and I think he has the skills and talents to help boost interest in an old system for the average joe (Buying a ROM download doesn't really help boost interest in the original system as much as they boost interest in emulation).
<br />
<br />If we truly love an old system, we should support any endeavors that could help "bring back" interest in our beloved system.
<br />
<br />P.S. There was also Battle Kid, but I think that game was a bit too frustrating to interest the average joe. A sonicesque game should interest the average joe/casual retro gamer.

GNU-tards are OK with selling copies, possibly bundled with online game server access or other kinds of support, but not with restricting the ability of anyone who buys a copy to make and sell more copies.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">(Buying a ROM download doesn't really help boost interest in the original system as much as they boost interest in emulation).</div>
<br />Agreed. If you want to make a game that runs in an emulator, make it in XNA Game Studio. XNA runs on the CLR, an emulator developed as part of the .NET Framework.
<br />
<br />As to the original question: There have been funny animal platformers with cats on Nintendo platforms before, such as Felix the Cat and Rockin' Kats* for NES and (as HJRodrigo mentioned) Bubsy for Super NES. As long as the eyes in your character's art style don't scream Sonic universe, there shouldn't be a problem. Maybe you could have the cats wear shirts like in Animal Crossing to distract Sega's lawyers even more.
<br />
<br />Or speaking of Animal Crossing, maybe you could have a blue hedgehog that looks more like the Able sisters. At the bottom of <a href="http://animalcrossing.wikia.com/wiki/File:AbleSistersInt.jpg" class="postlink">this screenshot</a>, to the left of the female human, is Mabel Able.

<br />Yeah... Looking at games like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b16upFloYak" class="postlink">Jazz Jackrabbit</a> and knowing they did OK is a relief. I mean, they even used gimmicks like the springs and the signs, which are obviously inspired by Sonic. Even the special stage is a copy of the one in Sonic CD. The only real twist is that Jazz has a gun (and the physics are not as refined).
