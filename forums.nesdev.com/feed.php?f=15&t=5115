Hi,<br />I used Ubuntu as a secondary OS for a while, but then it stopped working for no particular reason. I re-installed Kubuntu 10.10 (I took KDE for a change, I like to try different thing). However, this is a huge disapointment so far. A lot of thing that were working fine with Gnome are non-existant on KDE :<br /><br />- I can't change menu.lst to get Windows on the top of the list, the old menu.lst is still here in the /boot/grub directory, and I can't find any new one. Does anyone know how to change the bootlist ?<br /><br />- I can't find that cool tool where you type the name of a program, and that automatically download packages and install them.<br /><br />- The default web browser (rekonq) sucks. I tried downloading Opera packages, but I can't even install them ! It just refuses to do anything with them.<br />The apt get-install command never works either.<br /><br />So if nobody can help me I'll have to install my older Ubuntu version again, as KDE really REALLY sucks so far.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Dec 17, 2010 3:55 pm</p><hr />

Even if you have switched the OS already, you can keep using software you're used to until you find suitable replacements native to your new OS, instead of going through the trouble changing everything overnight.<br /><br />IMO, It all boils down to this: Are you happy with Windows? If yes, by all means, keep using it. I doesn't matter how good people say Linux is, it's not magical and you will not learn to love it overnight. Do you not like what M$ is doing to Windows and want to be free from it? Well, then you should switch to Linux, but keep in mind that this is not such an easy task and you'll face some difficulties until you get where you want. It all depends on your long-term goal.<br /><br />BTW, I'm no Linux lover (just a M$ hater!), but I recognize it's merits as a decent OS and have decided to switch to it eventually. I too have faced all the problems we're talking about here (drivers, dependency issues, not being able to compile things), but I guess I'll just keep trying until I can master all that crap.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Apr 27, 2009 1:34 pm</p><hr />
