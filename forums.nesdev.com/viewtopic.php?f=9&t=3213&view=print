<br />
<br />NES flash cart is more complex than anything Tototek has done because of all the mappers.
<br />
<br />I wish I could do preorders on my NES flash cart (<a href="http://www.nespowerpak.com" class="postlink">www.nespowerpak.com</a>) but I have learned that is a bad idea when dealing with China fabs.  Main part left is making new cart plastics.  I have the solid model now so I am starting to get production quotes.  I also have a PowerPak Lite ram board that supports 8 mappers and is writable through CopyNES.  All these and more will be on a website when I get those new case plastics...

<br />Will programs other than the menu be able to read and write from the FAT file system on the CF card?
<br />
<br />I see the CIC slot in your prototype board is unpopulated. Do you plan on using CIClone, -5 V, or just an instruction leaflet to cut lock pin 4?
<br />
<br />And how much do you intend to charge?

<br />
<br />Somewhere in the range of $120-140, will depend a lot on the injection molding price and if I want to make boxes too.  That looks unlikely now because places have a 1000 box minimum for printed paperboard thats die cut.  Price would have been at the low end if [michael] didn't disappear from #nesdev  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

For instance, ProDOS on Apple II left behind a 256-byte stub for the "MLI" syscall dispatcher, which bankswitched to the OS, looked up the syscall in the jump table, and jumped to it. It's not too messy if the standard ld65 link script for homebrew designed to use this cartridge specifies that, say, $7F00-$7FFF is reserved for use by the operating system.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And how much do you intend to charge?</div><br />Somewhere in the range of $120-140</div>
<br />That sounds acceptable, especially for early adopters like us. But if this enters larger-scale production, can the price come down?

Waiting on new cart plastics which I hope will be 3-4 weeks but that is China schedule so it could be 6 weeks...  When the first batch is sold I will be able to lower the price but I have no idea how long that will take.
<br />
<br />Right now I have all USA mappers except mmc5 working (some may be buggy), which is all but ~10 games.  Only USA game that will never work is Action 52 because it has too much prg.  Also have about 30 famicom/pirate mappers done but I dont know how many games that is.  In time the only carts that will never work are FDS and anything bigger than 512KB prg or 512KB chr.  Custom user designed mappers are also possible.  All the mappers are stored on the CF card so they are very easily upgraded.
<br />
<br />I can get a video together next week, must sleep before weekend of bike races!

<br />
<br />Are you going to release the documention so we could make our own mapper files?
<br />
<br />Will your board work with the GameGenie and ProActionReplay?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In an earlier thread, it was stated that the Power PAK has built-in GameGenie support.  I wouldn't use a real GG because you don't want to change the boot ROM by accident (even 8-letter codes aren't guaranteed to be safe here).  The Pro Action Replay, as I recall, modifies RAM (through a special NMI handler that temporarily overrides the cart's NMI routine), which can cause problems while the boot ROM is running if it modifies a critical section of RAM.  The PAR also maps in registers in the $5xxx range (if I remember right), so if the boot ROM uses that register space, there may be further conflicts.
<br />
<br />Long story short, I would not attach any cheat device to this cart.
