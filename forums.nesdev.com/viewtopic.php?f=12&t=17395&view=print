I believe the Mask ROMs are standard JEDEC order. Other than having one vs two ROMs, the only difference between the 1DC0N and 2DC0N boards is that the software run on the SNES writes one bit or another to the CX4 which controls whether the pin A20 contains a real signal (and /ROM1 is used exclusively) or whether A20 is ignored and /ROM1 and /ROM2 select between the first and 2nd megabyte.

For some reason, Sharp used the LH538 part number for some SNES MaskROMs as well as Game Boy ones, but the pinouts are NOT the same between them.<br /><br />Here's the pinout for the Game Boy one for comparison:<br /><img src="https://www.reinerziegler.de/lh538.gif" alt="Image" />

I managed to get tsop40 36pin chips to work on x2 board by grounding the leftover pins on the chip.<br />Ine curiousity though is that I found an image of Retrostage's sfx tsop converter with some info about using x2 in an x3 board. it states that you need a software patch to run x2 on an x3 board. Retrostages adapter has the same pinout as standard 32pin mask like x2 pcb. Perhaps this is evidence that the 40pin mask chip in x3 does at some point share the same pinout? And if not, perhaps i could isolate which pins go to the cx4 and wire it up that way? Either way would it be ok to leave the leftover mask pins on the board clean without wires?

I am trying to replace one 1.5mb 40pin mask rom with one 4mb 36pin 29f033c chip.</div><br /><br />I've done it, but it's not too straightforward.<br />The main issue is that the CX4 doesn't know where to map ROM data past 2MB, causing it not to enable the ROMs /OE line.<br />I'm not entirely sure of the process but I have some notes:<br /><br />- hack is based on MMX3 but I used 2-ROMs on a MMX2 board I changed that $7f52 register to be set to 0 instead of 1<br />- the data lines are passed from edge connector through CX4 to ROM, but CX4 tristates data lines (luckily not address lines!) when we're reading past 16mbit in ROM, so we have to run the data lines from ROM2 directly to the edge connector<br />- for simplicity, both ROM1 and ROM2 can have their /CE tied to GND and we'll do all switching on the /OE lines<br />- ROM1 will need the A20 line from the CX4 and the CX4 /ROMOE line can be used for the ROM1 /OE signal<br />- ROM2 is to be enabled while /ROMSEL is low and we're reading past the 16-mbit address on the bus. This is LoROM so that would be edge A22. <br />- instead of having the data pass through cx4, I placed the upper 16mbit in parallel with the cx4 directly on the edge connector. Then<br />the enable clause for the 2nd EEPROM is simply ~A22 || /ROMSEL.<br />So to modify a MMX2 board you:<br />- patch ROM file to set $7f52 to 1 instead of 0<br />- route ROM1 /CE to ground, /OE to cx4 pin 52 (/ROE)<br />- cut ROM2 data line traces to cx4 (behind the via's so ROM1 data<br />lines remain connected)<br />- route ROM2 data lines to edge connector using the pads next to C11-C17 marking<br />- route ROM2 /CE to ground, /OE to some logic formula (I used a 74139)<br />- get A20 from CX4 (no /CE trickery possible this time)<br /><br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IX3NVWv.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Lq2ZXS3.jpg" alt="Image" />
