Not deconstructing ruby's drivers was indeed the cause of the crash... and then there was another crash on exit. And another one. And another one! My Qt windows weren't deconstructing their widgets (and menus in the case of the presentation window) properly! So I wrote custom deconstructors to handle that properly, and I replaced every Qt slot with a C++11 lambda. Only 1 file in the entire source still requires moc to compile, and it's a template class for the file loader that defines custom events.<br /><br />I may have missed a window somewhere, but for now, I'm not getting any crashes on exit anymore. Let me know if you still have a crash on exit. If you do, don't delete your settings this time; they might be crucial in reproducing the crash.<br /><br />And finally, there was an order of operations issue with saving your configuration settings and deconstructing ruby's drivers, so that's been taken care of.<br /><br />Aside from crash on exit fixes, this version also makes a slight adjustment to the way frame skipping works in the Compatibility and Performance profiles; previously, a bug meant that instead of skipping frames, it was skipping <em>scanlines</em>. The symptom was that when using fast forward in the Compatibility or Performance profile, sometimes only part of the screen would be updated, divided into horizontal bars. It was most noticeable during fades to black. Now, it skips frames like it's supposed to. Note that the Accuracy profile doesn't have frame skip, so it was not affected.

I use Qt 5.10.1, but bsnes-mcfly has been tested as far back as Qt 5.7.<br /><br />Once you have extracted both of those, make sure you have the directories <s>“&lt;qt-install-dir&gt;\qtbase”</s> “&lt;qt-install-dir&gt;\qtbase\bin” and “&lt;mingw-install-dir&gt;\bin” in your PATH. If you install MinGW-w64 with an installer, the latter directory should be automatically handled for you.<br /><br />Then, navigate to where you installed bsnes-mcfly's source code and run cc.bat. I designed cc.bat to run the “pause” command if it detects that compilation failed, so it won't automatically close and prevent you from seeing any important error messages like most batch files do. cc.bat will compile the Accuracy and Compatibility profiles into bsnes\out\bsnes-mcfly.exe, so if you want the Performance profile, you'll have to go into the command prompt and run “mingw32-make profile=performance” from within the bsnes\ directory.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">007 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">even switching filters</div><br />Crashing on switching filters was an unrelated bug, caused by me being overzealous with optimizations and rendering directly into ruby's video buffer instead of using an intermediate buffer. I think I fixed that already in bsnes-mcfly v106r10, didn't I?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">007 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I have one suggestion, the description of compatible core states to switch to accuracy for the few problematic games.</div><br />The “few problematic games” mentioned in that description refer to Air Strike Patrol, which requires the Accuracy profile's PPU in order to draw a shadow under your plane, and Koushien 2 and Rendering Ranger R2, which both require cycle-based DSP timing (the Compatibility profile uses sample-based timing). <s>Go ahead and try to run those games in the Compatibility profile; you&#39;ll find that Air Strike Patrol will slow down the emulator to just barely faster than the Accuracy profile, because bsnes-mcfly looks up the internal ROM header&#39;s name &#40;“AIR STRIKE PATROL” or “DESERT FIGHTER” for the NTSC-J region&#41; and automatically activates the Accuracy profile&#39;s PPU, though it still uses the Compatibility profile&#39;s sample-based DSP timing. Similarly, Koushien 2 and Rendering Ranger R2 will automatically activate the cycle-based DSP timing while still using the OpenMP-based PPU in the Compatibility profile. The speed hit will be pretty minor compared to Air Strike Patrol.</s><br /><br />Note that the Performance profile does not automatically activate parts of other profiles like this. If you run Air Strike Patrol in the Performance profile, the plane shadow will be invisible.<br /><br />I could name those games directly in the description, but would that be legally safe? Could Nintendo or SETA find a reason to sue me for mentioning which games won't work with certain features? I already have a tooltip for the Double VRAM option that mentions that Yoshi's Island will look like a garbled mess with 128 KB VRAM (hover your mouse cursor over the checkbox to see it), and I'm a little iffy on that, too.<br /><br />EDIT: Corrected the PATH for Qt.<br /><br />EDIT 2: Whoops, forgot that I disabled automatic profile switching because of a crashing bug.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oops, I knew I forgot something. I had hoped that you could just use the precompiled Qt DLLs that I included in the ZIP download, and maybe that's technically true, but you still need to have moc (Qt's meta object compiler) and rcc (Qt's resource compiler) in order to compile bsnes-mcfly. And in order to get those, you'll need to compile Qt yourself.<br /><br />And the PATH isn't supposed to point to “&lt;qt-install-dir&gt;\qtbase”, it's supposed to point to “&lt;qt-install-dir&gt;\qtbase\bin” instead. Sorry about that.<br /><br />Did you read the included README.txt by any chance? I included directions for compiling Qt in there. I'll include the relevant section below:<br /><br />If you wish to compile Qt yourself on Windows, you will need MinGW-w64 SEH.<br />TDM-GCC has not been updated since 2015 and will not work.<br /><br />Open qtbase/mkspecs/win32-g++/qmake.conf and change the following properties:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">QMAKE_LINK&nbsp; &nbsp;= $${CROSS_COMPILE}g++ -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++<br />QMAKE_LINK_C = $${CROSS_COMPILE}gcc -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++</div><br /><br />Navigate to Qt's root directory and run the following command with no line breaks:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">configure -prefix %CD%\qtbase -release -opensource -confirm-license -nomake tests -nomake examples -no-opengl -no-zlib -skip qt3d -skip activeqt -skip qtandroidextras -skip qtcanvas3d -skip qtcharts -skip qtconnectivity -skip qtdatavis3d -skip qtgamepad -skip qtlocation -skip qtmacextras -skip qtnetworkauth -skip qtpurchasing -skip qtserialbus -skip qtspeech -skip qtwebglplugin -skip qtx11extras</div><br />Navigate to qtbase/ and run “mingw32-make”. This can take a while. You can optionally add a “-j#” option, where # is the number of simultaneous compilation jobs. The number of CPU cores you have minus 1 is a good number.<br /><br />When it is done, you will find some DLLs in the directory where you installed Qt's source. Here's where each one needs to be copied:<br /><ul><li>qtbase/lib/Qt5Core.dll → &lt;bsnes-mcfly&gt;/</li><li>qtbase/lib/Qt5Gui.dll → &lt;bsnes-mcfly&gt;/</li><li>qtbase/lib/Qt5Widgets.dll → &lt;bsnes-mcfly&gt;/</li><li>qtbase/plugins/platforms/qwindows.dll → &lt;bsnes-mcfly&gt;/platforms/</li><li>qtbase/plugins/styles/qwindowsvistastyle.dll → &lt;bsnes-mcfly&gt;/styles/</li></ul><br />If you need to recompile Qt, run “mingw32-make distclean -j#” first. (substitute # with the number of simultaneous jobs)

When enabled, if you load a game in the Accuracy profile, and then load the same game again in the Compatibility profile without a full restart first, bsnes-mcfly will crash.<br /><br />This bug affects the official bsnes as well (using the Fast PPU checkbox), and it even affects the latest v106r56 WIP release. I know byuu previously attempted a fix to work around the 1-game lag in calculating the save state size, but I guess it doesn't work as expected.<br /><br />The PPU and DSP are selected within SuperFamicom::System::load(), and serializeInit() is also called within the same function. But in bsnes, hackCompatibility() is called after emulator-&gt;load() has already been called... which means that it doesn't even have the intended effect and will run Air Strike Patrol with no visible shadow.<br /><br />I had a fix for the save state size's 1-game lag, but I dropped it because I thought byuu's fix would work. This was what I used:<br /><br />sfc/system/system.cpp<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">auto System::load(Emulator::Interface* interface) -&gt; bool {<br />&nbsp; //...<br />&nbsp; bus.reset();<br />&nbsp; if(!cartridge.load()) return false;<br /><br />&nbsp; hacks.fastPPU = settings.fastPPU;<br />&nbsp; hacks.fastDSP = settings.fastDSP;<br /><br />&nbsp; if(!cpu.load(system)) return false;<br />&nbsp; if(!smp.load(system)) return false;<br />&nbsp; if(!ppu.load(system)) return false;<br />&nbsp; if(!dsp.load(system)) return false;<br />&nbsp; //...<br />&nbsp; serializeInit();<br />&nbsp; this-&gt;interface = interface;<br />&nbsp; return information.loaded = true;<br />}</div><br />I loaded the cartridge first. This was required in order to read the ROM header. Then I set the hack settings, and loaded the PPU and DSP afterwards.<br /><br />...but even that doesn't fix this crash bug now. And GDB doesn't help, it just says that the crash happened in a Windows DLL.

The same is true of the official bsnes, and when importing the ROM in icarus for use in higan.

The preferred form is to concatenate the firmware directly to the end of the ROM that uses it, but you can also put it in the firmware/ directory where bsnes-mcfly is installed. Even though the performance profile has high-level emulation of the DSP1, it requires the firmware in order to validate the DSP program. I made it that way in order to not relieve any pressure on No-Intro to bundle the firmwares with the ROMs that use them.<br /><br />As for Bad Apple, bsnes-mcfly does recognize that the ROM is an ExHiROM, but unfortunately, the Board database that is borrowed from higan does not define a board for ExHiROM without any cartridge RAM (both Tales of Phantasia and Daikaijuu Monogatari II have cartridge RAM), so Bad Apple won't work without a manifest, or unless you edit the header to indicate the presence of cartridge RAM. For the latter, change byte $40FFD8 from 0x00 to 0x05.<br /><br />You could ask byuu to add an entry to the Boards database for ExHiROM without RAM, but because no commercial game was ever released using it, I doubt he will agree to add it for you.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />angrylion asked about loading both games as “plain .sfc files”. I just provided an option that would avoid creating manifests, because those are primarily associated with cartridge folders, and I can't assume that angrylion has no opposition to placing a manifest right next to the ROM, even if it technically doesn't need to be in a .sfc folder.<br /><br />...oh, but Bad Apple works in bsnes v073 without a manifest, doesn't it? Dang, I don't really like the idea, but I did say that I would “take any legal means to replace bsnes v073”, so...<br /><br />I will create a supplemental boards database in order to fill in the gaps that byuu has left in his boards database. Its first entry will be “EXHIROM” without a “-RAM” suffix, so that Bad Apple will work without the need to edit the ROM or supply a manifest. Unfortunately, there is no way to also support the DSP1 prototype in the same way. Even if the firmware is concatenated, it's either supply a manifest, or edit the ROM. I don't think bsnes v073 supports it manfest-free either (although bsnes v072 and earlier have high-level emulation, bsnes-classic was not forked from those versions), so I shouldn't have to worry about that one, at least.<br /><br />Annoying reminder: bsnes-mcfly tries to compete with bsnes v073 and bsnes-classic. It does not try to compete with the official bsnes v107. If you are satisfied with bsnes v107, I recommend that you continue to use it so that you don't have to suffer the bug's nest that is Qt.
