		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />While looking at mega man 9 concrete man map that someone made <a href="http://vgmaps.com/Atlas/Wii/MegaMan9-ConcreteMan.png" class="postlink">here</a> I started to ask myself what kind of metatile they could have used (that must be one of the side effects of the nesdev "virus" I guess <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />).
<br />
<br />My first impression was that they could have used a 4x4 metatile then made metatile out of metatile. But when you look at the patterns...  In general it could be fine but in some case you would have to make redundant meta-metatile just for some specific area.  
<br />
<br />I guess it's not that much an interesting question but what do people think about it?  What kind of metatile mega man 9 or other mega man game uses in general?  As it always been the same?  I'm curious.  My guess is now on the 4x4 metatile only, no meta-metatile.
<br />
<br />I should just play the $#%! game and stop checking those details... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think you are right about the 4x4 metatiles, and it seems they are arranged in "screens", since the path is always 1 screen tall or 1 screen wide. I'd guess that each screen is individually encoded, but it appers they can't be considered metatiles themselves, as it seems they are not reused in different parts of the level.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, since this game was not made to run on a system with severe memory limitations, it might very well have the levels stored in a very straightforward not compressed format just mimicking the overall look of it's predecessors, which for sure used metatile-based compression. Someone would have to reverse engineer the game and check, I guess.
