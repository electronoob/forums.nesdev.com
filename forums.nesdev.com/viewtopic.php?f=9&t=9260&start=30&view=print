It's also not a 1Hz square wave, a 1 Hz pulse train, or a 1 second one-shot. You <em>could</em> call it a 10-100ms one-shot. <br /><br />However, there are at least two reasons that it doesn't matter whether or how we clock the CIC on the cartridge—first, the CICs are dynamic logic, so if it's clocked slower than 10kHz or so it'll just crash anyway, and secondly, unlike in the SNES where some games lock the ROM if the stream to the CIC KEY isn't valid, nothing in the NES does so here it doesn't matter. As a result, there's no need to disconnect CIC CLOCK by lifting pin 4.<br /><br />The only things connected to the input there are: a 0.1µF capacitor to 5V, a 0.01µF capacitor to ground, the switch to 5V, and the resistor to ground.<br />The <a href="http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/74HCU04.pdf" class="postlink">74HCU04</a> has a maximum input leakage current at 25°C of 0.1µA, and 1µA over the full temperature range, which is still smaller than the current through the 1MΩ resistor over the entire relevant voltage range (It could be comparable once the capacitor has charged the the node to below 1 volt, but at that point the output is firmly into TTL logic high output). Thus there is no reason that the resistor needs to be &quot;at most 10kΩ&quot; since this is just a passive timing circuit.
