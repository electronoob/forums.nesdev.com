		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, I am just thinking about rev-engineering and maybe emulating the Playchoice 10. There is a PC10 service manual with complete PC10 schematics, and MAME includes PC10 emulation source code - so getting the hardware specs together should be no big problem. But two questions on the software side:<br /><br /><strong>Is there anything known on the INST ROM format?</strong><br />It contains Instruction texts, and some program code, and this or that other stuff - but I don't know yet what is where.<br /><br /><strong>Is there already a ROM-image format for PC10 games?</strong><br />The iNES header includes a flag for indicating the presence of the INST ROM - but not for the RP5H01 PROM. The PROM is, I think, required for decrypting the game title (and maybe also for other data in the INST ROMs, like maybe the Instruction text...?).<br />So far, the iNES format looks incomplete - having only the encrypted INST ROM but not the PROM decryption key - looks rather useless to me (unless there's a way to decrypt the data without the PROM?).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, rev-engineered the INST ROM format on my own. It contains a bunch of hardcoded pointers, and a somewhat encrypted 40h-byte area, which contains the tilte, GameID (I think), and a bunch more pointers. The good news is that more than half of the plenty pointers don't seem to be used by the BIOS, a few of them might be internally used by INST ROM code, but of course, there's no need to that in homebrew projects.<br />The actually important pointers are: 1) get 40h-byte-area function, 2) display-instruction-line function, 3) a few very simple functions (ret opcode, jp hl opcode's, waitvblank function, set a variable to zero). Well, and that's all about it. The first 2 functions are looking incredibly complicated - but when removing the decryption code, they can be implemented in a handful of opcodes.<br />I'll still need to clean up the specs before releasing them &amp; research some details like what character+palette number gives what color, and what GameIDs are used/available.<br /><br /><strong>PC10 ROM-Image Format</strong><br />There seems to be absolutely no way to use the INST ROMs without the RP5H01 PROMs - so there seems to be no way around changing/expanding the &quot;iNES&quot; format. Somehow like so:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; 16 byte&nbsp; &nbsp;NES Header<br />&nbsp; 512 byte&nbsp; Trainer (if any)<br />&nbsp; N*16K&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PRG-ROM<br />&nbsp; N*8K&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CHR-ROM (if any)<br />&nbsp; 8K&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PC10 INST-ROM<br />&nbsp; 16 byte&nbsp; &nbsp;PC10 PROM Data&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;--- NEW<br />&nbsp; 16 byte&nbsp; &nbsp;PC10 PROM CounterOut&nbsp; &lt;--- NEW<br />&nbsp; 128 byte&nbsp; Title (if any)<br /></div><br /><span style="color: #FF0000"><strong>Would that be okay?<br />Any reasons not to use that format?<br />Or any suggestions for a better format?</strong></span><br /><br />The 16-byte PROM Data would be the 9 bytes plus trailing 7 mirror/padding bytes as how they are returned from the real PROM's Data Out pin. Basically same as the MAME security.prm files - but I'd really prefer to use the correct bit-order (Bit0 stored in BIT0 of first byte, NOT in BIT7 of first byte), and without the inversion being used in MAME. In practice: The first 4 bytes for &quot;1942&quot; should be 31,39,34,32 which does perfectly match the game's title (in the MAME files, the bytes would be 73,63,D3,B3 which doesn't match anything for good).<br /><br />The 16-byte PROM CounterOut would be the CounterOut pin accordingly. In original carts, this would be always 00,00,00,00,FF,FF,FF,FF,00,00,00,00,FF,FF,FF,FF, but for PROM-less homebrew carts it'd be waste of money to reproduce that pattern (for such games, all sixteen bytes FFh-filled should work, and would be obviously cheaper to implement) (the cheapest way I could imagine would be using the unused 74LS367 output to produce a HIGH level upon /CHANNEL_SELECT, and then to pass that HIGH level to the Data &amp; CounterOut pins via two diodes).<br /><br /><strong>MAME security.prm's</strong><br />The &quot;security.prm&quot; files in MAME rom-sets might be the best source to get the PROM data for each game. I could make a tool for inverting &amp; reversing them, appending them to existing ROM-images, and alongside fixing missing PC10 flags in some ROM-images.<br />Though I don't know how many of that PROMs are actually dumped (there should be around 55 PC10 games) - does anybody have a collection of that files &amp; know how many &quot;security.prm&quot; files do exist?<br />The other problem is that ALL files seem to be called &quot;security.prm&quot; which is rather uncomfortable to use - if somebody could rename them to &quot;&lt;cartname&gt;.prm&quot; would be very helpful!
