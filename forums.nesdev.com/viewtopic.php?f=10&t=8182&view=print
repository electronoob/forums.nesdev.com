		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello, I'd like to ask how good is performance of games made with cc65 (c compiler for 6502 which has also NES target) on real hardware, since I am really bad at ASM and prefer high lvl languages? Obviously on emulators it'll ork fine but how about real hardware?
<br />
<br />I asking, because ASM is too hard for me, barely made "Hello World" as .com file for DOS with nasm and tutorial (and by "made" I mean copied code and enter compilation command) and since 6502 has completely different architecture than x86 family, I know I won't be able to make things without hi-level language such as C.
<br />
<br />So if performance of cc65-made programs is good enough on real hardware (I know that my productions won't probably go beyond rom file phase, but it'd be nice to see some day on some bootleg cartridge originating from russia/china my game), I'd like to ask where I can find tutorials about writing complete game with cc65 (the one here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://design4dev.wetpaint.com/page/Programming+in+C+for+NES">http://design4dev.wetpaint.com/page/Pro ... +C+for+NES</a><!-- m --> is too easy), especially handling controls, graphics and sound/music.

<br />
<br />6502 assembly isn't hard IMO. I'm the opposite way though, I believe C is exponentially harder than assembly, unless your for some reason programming an intel chip.

<br />
<br />Also you need to understand that I don't like c family of languages (maybe except c#), prefer simpler ones like pascal and basic, but here I don't have choice. Either C or ASM. Afaik there are no pascal/basic compilers with NES target (preferably pascal).

<br />There are no tutorials, but there are a couple of simple demos in the <a href="http://kkfos.aspekt.fi/projects/nes/knes-library-for-cc65/" class="postlink">KNES</a> package (my simple C NES development library). You can also download Alter Ego, but be aware that it uses quite a lot of routines written in assembly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The beautiful thing about CC65/KNES is that you can code in C and optimize bit by bit into separate CA65 assembly functions as needed. You get the readabilty of C with the optional speed of assembly. Just my layman's take on the matter.
<br />As others have said see the Alter Ego source for a great example of this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The assembly routines in Alter Ego aren't game-specific, it is low-level stuff only, like setting up a sprite or playing music. All the game logic is written in C. So you can use them as a library and make a simple game without touching assembly much or at all.

<br />
<br />I don't like this tutorial, it's a bunch of memory pokes written out in longhand C.  It's just like the ASM version, but less readable.
<br />The only C code in there was a small while loop to iterate through the string to output "Hello World" on the screen.
