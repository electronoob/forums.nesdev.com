I noticed that Geigers also did this, and I see it happening here as well? You can clearly tell this when you know the exact ram address for the controller push bits. I'm using Megaman X as my rom of choice, for using your current debugger, and when I press whichever pushbit I want, it takes nearly a second 1/2 to display. This is for every kind of action within the hex viewer. I didn't know if this was something unavoidable, or if this is a symptom of my Windows 7 OS? <br /><br />I've already began finding new things within MMX, that I was never able to before, until now! Really cant wait for new revisions! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> Having a lot of fun with this!

Which didn't help, so I then found that this patch to the Core Graphics headers did the trick: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://gist.github.com/jweinberg/3336233">https://gist.github.com/jweinberg/3336233</a><!-- m -->

Will try to build Qt 4 Cocoa and see what happens... It seems that there are some references to Carbon in the ruby/input stuff too, maybe it's possible to def those to use SDL instead so any references to Carbon can be abolished completely.
