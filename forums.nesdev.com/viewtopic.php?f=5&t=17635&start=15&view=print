		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's always cool to invent machines that could have been there in the 80s.<br /><br />Personally, if I had a fantasy console to make I'd make it store games on VHS tapes, and use them for CGI too, just like later CD-based consoles used CD for both storing the game and the music. Of course by todays standards it'd be shitty, but back then this would have made a CDi like-console, a great platform for shitty games. Or I'd use casettes for both game data and music, that'd be fun too.<br /><br />Sharing RAM and VRAM among the same adress spaces simplifies programming, but it means halving the bandwith, so halving CPU processing power and PPU limiting graphics (for example in the C64 if you want colours, each pixels is repeated twice horizontally because of that). You could just say &quot;well let's double the clock speed then&quot;, but then you have to have expensive fast RAM in each console shipped, and expensive fast ROMs in game cartridges (if that support is used). If insteads games are loaded from some magnetic support in RAM, then you need even more expensive RAM in the console.

This case was of course unintentional, but some of the utility of the effect is that it requires 0 cycles to mask sprites this way since it is hardware accelerated (virtual hardware in this case of course). If a system allows for more (all?) sprites to be shown on the same scanline, its utility would be maximized. <br /><br />full article:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_sprite_priority">https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_sprite_priority</a><!-- m -->

If the square signal started high, then goes low in the second half of the cycle, you could set the frequency low and keep resetting the phase to keep it always high. That'd make 4-bit CPU-driven PCM possible, but only if the CPU is uninterrupted across the frames. (The graphics buffering scheme would probably make that impossible.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Fautenic wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">93143 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'm still not clear on how 256x192 with square pixels is possible without wide black borders on all sides.

NTSC does not have a variable number of lines. (The horizontal resolution can be varied a lot, however, as it's just an analogue signal anyway.)<br /><br />You have 192 lines. Either you have 48 blank lines to fill out the rest of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/240p" class="postlink">240p</a> picture, or you have to do a vertical rescaling.

By changing the specific rate at which a digital device emits pixels, the width of each pixel changes accordingly.<br /><br />So the specific amount of image that's encoded in the signal (e.g. 640x480i that's overscanned so only ≈600x448 is visible) means that a 256x192 console with square pixels would be &quot;windowboxed&quot; like the C64.<br /><br />Consoles like the Master System that drew 192-scanline-high video modes instead often stretched the pixels a little bit horizontally to make the display more nearly full-width; correspondingly the screen is letterboxed.

The corresponding pillarboxes would be a little more prominent, but maybe not a huge problem. Also eliminates the &quot;safe area&quot; problem that we normally have with TVs.<br /><br />Then again I grew up with an Atari ST which had a big empty colour-0 border around the screen at all times...

So yes, it'd be underscanned like a 1980s home computer.
