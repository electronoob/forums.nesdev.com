Hey, I hate copier headers, trainers and the like as much as the next guy, but unfortunately, ROMs off the internet come that way. The only thing I don't want is to have to convert every file I download to one emulator's specific format, while keeping the original blob for the rest. Redundancy sucks, it's messy and just plain confusing.<br /><br />As I see it, forcing users to accept a new format that only your software uses is intrusive and arrogant. I'm not against putting a new format out there, but instead of forcing people to use it, the format's superiority should be enough to convince people to use it.

There are lots of image formats because most have unique size, quality, or layer advantages. We're really only dealing with legacy popularity here.<br /><br />We need to support recently dumped coprocessor roms (and multi-rom games in general) in a way that makes sense. And for NES, it shouldn't require file loading to see a game's mapper, rom sizes, chr presence, etc. We hide all that shit in a blob for... why exactly? Folders/archives make more sense and always have.<br /><br />Furthermore, there are plenty of other emulators to use with old formats. So the discussion we really should be having is why THEY are so averse to supporting a newer format if it improves compatibility and makes basic rom information easier to see.<br /><br />In your defense, I don't completely agree with what byuu has done either. I think using an internal database, even if it means having an unlicensed database, is a much better path to acceptance due to the natural volatility of trying to account for every mapping quirk in thousands of games. The NES bmls are already toast and getting changed to a scripting format. And I've also heard him say that he's not 100% happy with the SNES bmls either, so that's subject to change as well. I spent like... 100 hours preparing that NES library by hand because converters are GIGO with iNES files. And now I'll have to do it again mucking about in <em>thousands</em> of folders.<br /><br />But I'm still happy with the structure and overall direction of the format. I think it's absurd that byuu takes any heat for doing this when we had games bugging out for like 15 years suddenly getting their coprocessor roms dumped. This should have been exciting stuff. Instead people were pissed that it made their old rom format obsolete when we were forced to account for multi-rom situations.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3720">FitzRoy</a> — Fri Apr 10, 2015 2:33 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">byuu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />EDIT: I wrote a lengthy reply to this which some people saw, but decided to remove it. I'm tired of having these discussions, sorry.<br /></div><br />I was replying before you deleted the post, but now that you did it seems silly to post my response.<br /><br />I too have no intention to fight, but from your original post I could see that you didn't understand the motivation behind my post in this thread, so I will explain at least this part.<br /><br />I respect the decisions you made regarding your own software and have long stopped complaining about them, as far as higan is concerned, and have simply stopped using it. It's a great SNES emulator, but there are other SNES emulators around, and having to keep duplicate game libraries just to cater to one emulator's needs is not something I can condone.<br /><br />What I expressed here is my concern about the use of custom file formats becoming a fad among emulators, like this thread initially suggested. Can you imagine if every NES emulator decided to maintain ROMs in their own preferred format? I'd have to keep a library in iNES format, one in UNIF format, another in chips + XML format... Might not necessarily be a lot of hard disk space nowadays, but it's still a mess of redundancy that's hard to maintain as I discover new games I want to keep around. I hope you can understand my concern.<br /><br />I think it's wrong for an emulator to act all sovereign like it's the only one in that PC. I use different emulators for different purposes... One is better for playing, other for debugging and another for recording videos, and I don't think I'm asking much when I want them to play nice with each other and use the same unified game library.<br /><br />I'm not against having more options for file formats, only against the ignoring of well established standards (even if they're not perfect - nothing is perfect) in favor of a new one, in hopes of forcing people to use that. I don't like being forced to do things, but if a format is optional and is indeed interesting enough to start being used elsewhere, I might consider adopting it once support is satisfactory.<br /><br />I want to make it clear that this is not an attack on higan or byuu, and I have absolutely no intentions of changing higan. I'm simply making it clear why I think one of the choices made for that program is undesirable in hopes that others realize that and don't follow the same path.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Apr 09, 2015 11:25 am</p><hr />

Because the SNES supports the Super Gameboy, in order to have 100% complete SNES emulation, you have to incorporate accurate Gameboy emulation as well.  Then, since you have written a Gameboy core, a Gameboy Color core then is not that much effort.  In the same vein, having a solid 65816 core and having accurate Nintendo-style sound, a NES emulator does not seem to be that much of an effort (at first).  Going further, since the SNES emulation already supports ARM emulation for that one Shogi game that uses it, a Gameboy Advance emulator becomes doable especially since you already have half the sound emulation and some similarities with SNES graphics.  It may not be nearly as much of a snowball effect as Sega emulation, but it goes to show how emulators can grow well beyond their original intended limits.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> — Tue Apr 07, 2015 2:34 pm</p><hr />

The conversions that will happen internally so the data can be used are not my concern, and I shouldn't be forced to store the modified data anywhere.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Apr 07, 2015 11:45 am</p><hr />
