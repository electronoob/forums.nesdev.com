<br />Dutch-Win's "pirate" cart, taken from <a href="http://clix.to/jeroen-online" class="postlink">http://clix.to/jeroen-online</a>

<br /><img src="http://bmf.rustedlogic.net/misc/gyroscam_org.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />Uh oh! The <strong>original</strong> image, taken from <a href="http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/23" class="postlink">http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/23</a>
<br />
<br />Obviously, all he did was cover up the original watermark and board ID. I thought those weird white marks near the connector looked fishy; kyuusaku's observations just pushed me to investigate further.
<br />
<br />Sorry, kid, you lose. What did you hope to gain from this stupid little stunt? Was it an elaborate plot to get someone to "fix" Palutena no Kagami to run on a cart for you? If so, you could've just asked, and not made a complete fool of yourself. Either that, or played a little old NES game called "Kid Icarus." I hear Nintendo did a pretty good job converting it! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />What I want to know is what the heck is up with the brown paint job?
<br />Perhaps someone did a poor job of removing whatever previous label was on the cart, and dipping it in brown paint was the (hoaxer's) solution to covering up label remnants?

<br />I got a converter for dirt cheap!! ( only â‚¬0,50!!!)

<br />I took a quickshot with my (old) mobile phone.

<br />
<br />My roommate (downloader) has fooled around with this rom he couldn't get to work.
<br />I know little Commodor 64 ASM and since it's both 6502 (nes &amp; c64)he thought I could make this work.
<br />
<br />But the guy didn;t knew what he was doing and this rom was so not understandable, I just had to see what you guys could do with it.
<br />
<br />and I made up the story about the cart to make it look cooler.
<br />
<br />But still, would you like to check it out?
<br />
<br />btw. I think I can erase the BIOS from there.....

<br />
<br />If you want Kid Icarus, are you just wanting a japanese version on a cartridge, or are you just wanting save capability on a cartridge? 
<br />
<br />If you want to save, you could hack the US Kid Icarus ROM. You could probably fairly easily hack together a single save system, probably not too much harder to make a multi save system out of it. You just need to know 6502 ASM, download a NES tech document and grab FCEUXD. That's all you really need to do that. Assuming you do know what you are doing. 
<br />
<br />Furthermore on the subject, why would you want to save on Kid Icarus so badly when there is a password system? And finally, people here generally do not do work on request.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well I would like a save system on Kid Icarus.
<br />3 saves would be nice (just like the FDS).
<br />
<br />I know there is a hacked translated rom on the net which shows the Jap TitleScreen and jap characters, but it stil has the password system and I want the save system like the FDS has got.
<br />
<br />I know people don't work by request, but this is something I really really really want.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, the thing to do would be to find the subroutines for "Continue" or rather the Password Entering screen, as well as the screen where you get your password or whenever else you'd want to be able to save. Then you also need to find out if there is any unused RAM between $6000 - $7FFF that you can use. It'll be a problem if you can't find any. But after you find all that you should be able to save status into some free RAM space and restore it as you wish. I mean it isn't ubber noob easy, but I don't really think it is that hard either. 
<br />
<br />So you might want to check out <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.romhacking.net">www.romhacking.net</a><!-- w --> for ASM hacking info. If this sort of thing is beyond you, you'll have to look around for someone else to do this project which will likely be just as hard.
<br />
<br />Also, have you considered buying a FDS system? That would seem to me to be the ideal thing to do. They don't really cost all that much money if you really are into it.
