<title type="html"><![CDATA[Mixing fields into frames]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=292&amp;p=1924#p1924"><![CDATA[
Hello all<br /><br />I'm currently working on a project in wich I use pseudo pixels to draw stuff to the screen. I'm using the tiles to simulate quite large pixels (we've all seen this a few times before).<br /><br />The thing is since I'm already working at such low resolution, if I get stuck with only 4 colors my program will look like shit. I can't use different palettes and have different values in the attribute table since there is no way my program will respect 16x16 pixel squares, it is all very dynamic.<br /><br />Then I figured that if I combined 2 4-color palettes, I'd get an amazing total of 16 colors. My plan is: I'll render the image twice (one on each page, one on top of the other, doesn't matter), one with the pixels for one palette and the other for another palette. Then I'll flip both images and palettes every (NES) frame to combine the two images in one (NTSC) frame.<br /><br />I have already picked the perfect 2 palettes for what I'm planning, the combinations look amazing.<br /><br />In theory it works very well, but do you guys have any experience on how this kind of effect looks on an actual TV? I'm pretty sure it will look like crap on emulators. There are some NES demos about interlacing trying to achieve the same goal right?<br /><br />I have no way to test this stuff on the actual hardware, so I'm asking to anyone who has seen this kind of effect running on a NES and a TV, how well does it work?<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Apr 23, 2005 8:30 pm</p><hr />
