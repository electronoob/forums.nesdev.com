Famitracker does not suppress DPCM pops. Its only filters are the usual lowpass on the whole circuit + DC filter highpass, which are pretty standard for emulating the NES.<br /><br />Because the DPCM pop is an all-band sound, it's affected by just about any subtle tweaks you could make to the overall signal. An emulator doesn't have to have specific DPCM pop suppression, a subtly different filter setup can make a quite audible difference. Even trying a few different NES or Famicom units, the pops will sound a little different.<br /><br />Some emulators do have methods specifically to suppress the DPCM pop, but if they do it should be an option and not on by default. I don't believe FCEUX, Nestopia, or VirtuaNES does this by default. I think in general the underlying digital emulation of DPCM pops is more or less the same across the board, but the subtle difference in analog filter implementations makes a bit of a difference on pops.<br /><br />Famitracker generally has very accurate sound emulation. I've compared it directly against hardware recordings many times. As I said above, though, the hardware is a bit of a moving target. DPCM pops are one of the most volatile sounds in terms of consistency across machines.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sun Feb 09, 2014 9:14 am</p><hr />

Alrighty, update!<br />After a good 1 week of failing and only getting so close that I actually made a turbo controller out of the basic one, I decided to go ahead and use the code from tepples. (Thanks for that!) It still involved a tiny bit of work because I had to chop the code up and spread the pieces across the last two banks, so that I could avoid having to lose any space for samples.<br /><br />Before moving on to creating the DPCM player, I'll try to remove everything second controller-related (that'll be a thing...) on one hand because this way players won't be able to use the cheat features, plus I'll get a few bytes in the zero page to work with in my player routine.<br /><br />Please don't help me with this unless I'm tearing my hair out. The whole point of this should be that I figure things out myself, which I've already failed at doing.<br /><br />EDIT:Oh, never mind, that was pathetically easy. Right! Now comes the fun part with the DPCM samples.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6362">za909</a> — Sat Feb 01, 2014 3:32 am</p><hr />

Getting started on a game from scratch is much easier than getting started on a non-trivial hack. However, getting a game finished from scratch is much harder than most hacks, I'd say.<br /><br />There are several popular 6502 assemblers that will run on modern windows. I strongly prefer cc65, myself. cc65 comes with a disassembler, and you can use its linker's &quot;segment&quot; feature to easily align the code you are replacing in your hack.<br /><br />My advice is just to break your task down into small increments. Do a little bit at a time and make sure it works before moving on. Learn how to use FCEUX's debugger, or some other NES emulator's debugger as you're doing this.<br /><br />Another thing might help is generating a &quot;code data log&quot;. FCEUX can do this. It creates a map of what memory is code and which is data. This can help a lot when creating a disassembly.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sun Jan 26, 2014 6:30 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">za909 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I have illegal instructions in lines 7 and 9.<br /></div><br />That's because you tried to use an operand with the RTS operator, but RTS doesn't take any operators. You probably meant to use JSR here, to call the same subroutine twice. OK, now let's see what else is wrong:<br /><br />The actual joyinit looks correct, but unlike your first call to it suggests, it doesn't return any results in the accumulator, it stores the controller bits directly into the this_frame variable. This means that there's no point in having &quot;sta this_frame&quot; after the call. If the bits are already in this_frame, you're actually trashing them with the STA. Which leads to another problem:<br /><br />If the joyinit routine is overwriting the contents of this_frame, you have to back that up to prev_frame BEFORE calling it, otherwise you'll lose the previous frame's bits. Just do the &quot;lda this_frame; sta prev_frame&quot; before the calls to joyinit. Similarly, you will trash the first call's bits if you don't back them up before the second call to joyinit. You don't seem to be using the Y register, so that seems like a good place to temporarily put the bits in (put &quot;ldy this_frame&quot; between the two calls to joyinit).<br /><br />Now, after the second call, you already have the previous frame's bits in prev_frame, this frame's first read in Y and this frame's second read in this_frame. There's no need to store and load a bunch of stuff like you did, you can simply compare Y to this_frame with &quot;cpy this_frame&quot;. Now, the original suggestion was that you used the previous frame's bits in case the new reads didn't agree, but it seem you are trying to do the two reads again. Both are possible solution, and if you want to try again you have to jump back to the part after you have backed up last frame's bits, otherwise you'll trash them (if you think about it, you won't even the need the previous frame's bits y=if you're reading the joypad over and over, so you can get rid of everything related to prev_frame). If you just want to use the old bits, you can &quot;lda prev_frame; sta this frame&quot;. I see no need for the usable_frame variable, because the contents of this_frame will be the usable data.<br /><br />I guess this is all I can see wrong with your code. I have to agree that it looks very chaotic, and that you haven't planned the execution order very well in your head. Keep in mind that instructions in a program are executed in order, so it's easy to do a preliminary run of it in your head to see whether variables are being overwritten and where all the data is going when you move it around.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Jan 26, 2014 10:30 am</p><hr />

Actually that's fine because getting rid of the code for the second controller is of no consequence really. <br />But yeah, I've been meaning to learn all this, it's just that when I think about how much stuff there is, suddenly there's no wonder why there were so many people developing a single game. I just can't work on everything at once. It's no good that I'm interested in the APU features, and some of the PPU features, because there's still everything else to do.<br />And I really don't want much, just getting some sort of a NROM-based clone game done is the way to go at first I guess.<br /><br />Edit: Ok, I came up with something, but it's not even willing to compile it, saying I have illegal instructions in lines 7 and 9.<br />But it doesn't matter because it wouldn't work anyway.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">this_frame = $00<br />prev_frame = $14<br />usable_frame = $16<br />.org $C545<br /><br />controller_beg:<br />; Store two consecutive reads and then compare them<br />rts joyinit<br />sta this_frame<br />rts joyinit<br />tax <br />lda this_frame<br />sta prev_frame<br />txa <br />sta this_frame<br />lda prev_frame<br />cmp this_frame<br />bne controller_beg ; If reads don't match, start over<br />sta usable_frame<br />ldx #$00<br />stx this_frame<br />stx prev_frame<br />rts<br /><br />joyinit: ; Get all 8 bits from the controller port<br />ldx #$01<br />stx $4016<br />dex<br />stx $4016<br />ldx #$08<br />getbits:<br />lda $4016<br />and #$03<br />cmp #$01<br />ror this_frame<br />dex<br />bne getbits<br />rts<br /><br /></div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6362">za909</a> — Sun Jan 26, 2014 8:47 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Hacking now suddenly seems much more difficult than making a new game.<br /></div><br />Absolutely, for anything more than the simplest of changes. <br /><br />Rant edit: Also, making original stuff is a good thing to do. I never learned how to hack. One day I just realized I could after making original stuff for so long. I feel like people who get into hacking first skip a lot of the programming fundamentals and end up banging their head against the wall over really dumb stuff. (Not you specifically, just a thing I see in general.) Whatever game is in question already does things like read the joypad and whatever, so when you hack you avoid learning how to do stuff like that. In fact, many spend more time looking for ways to avoid learning a thing than would take to just learn it. Don't be that guy, please. If the end hacked result and not the knowledge is all you care about, I imagine you won't get it done.<br /><br />I used to like making free, simple hacks for group hacked-end-result, but I've gradually lost my taste for that.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I could never find any assembler that worked for me.<br /></div><br />As unregistered said, get asm6: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://home.comcast.net/~olimar/NES/">http://home.comcast.net/~olimar/NES/</a><!-- m --><br />It's even open source if you happen to not be on Windows.<br /><br />It'll take a very simple input. Here's a piece of a thing I assembled. Basically just needs a .org statement and your code. Will give you a binary, which you then throw into the rom.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">pointerlo = $02<br />pointerhi = $03<br /><br />;Initialize Pointer<br />;Must find two free bytes of zero page RAM<br />   .org $FF30<br />   lda #$01<br />   sta pointerlo;Unused, reserved for player 2<br />   lda #$60<br />   sta pointerhi;Unused, reserved for player 2<br />   <br />   jmp $8095<br /></div><br /><br />Edit: Ah! And if you're working with a disassembly, yes, you have to get working whatever assembler was used by who made the disassembly or modify the disassembly to work with the assembler YOU choose. Thems the breaks. The latter generally isn't too tough if you actually understand your assembler's syntax.<br /><br />If you want to practice 6502 code from scratch in a test setting, there's the 6502 macroassembler: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://exifpro.com/utils.html">http://exifpro.com/utils.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Edit: <div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />(except that I don't get what the difference is between LSR and ROR)<br /></div><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">clc<br />lda #$01<br />lsr a<br />;#$00 is in A<br /></div><br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">sec<br />lda #$01<br />lsr a<br />;#$00 is in A<br /></div><br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">clc<br />lda #$01<br />ror a<br />;#$00 is in A<br /></div><br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">sec<br />lda #$01<br />ror a<br />;#$80 is in A<br /></div><br /><br />Ror puts the carry bit into bit 7 of memory (or A). Lsr ignores the carry, and always shifts a zero into bit 7.<br /><br />Edit: Hopefully the final edit... Tepples, your routine is missing the label &quot;frame_not_glitched&quot;, and clocks in at 93 bytes. The original was 88. There might be other problems too, I might look at it more when I have some more time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Sun Jan 26, 2014 6:07 am</p><hr />

The problem isn't that I have no idea what I'm doing. I've been hacking for what...4 years now? The problem is that when I wanted to actually practice 6502 asm, I could never find any assembler that worked for me. They're either all DOS or x32 based, so I can't really run them at all, or they're like nesticle, which just intimidate me so bad at first glance. I mean there so much stuff, and I don't know where to begin. All I'd want is just getting straight to the point and start writing my code. I know what the opcodes mean and do (except that I don't get what the difference is between LSR and ROR) and I understand how to control the other peripherals with the CPU.<br /><br />Hacking now suddenly seems much more difficult than making a new game. I have to make sure I don't change anything, not the stack, not the CPU status before I end my part of the code, and I can't exceed the original amount of data.<br />In my programs there'd be huge lag anyway because of pushing and pulling every millisecond to make sure the next operations have a clean status register.<br /><br />I'll come back to this once I have some time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6362">za909</a> — Sun Jan 26, 2014 1:12 am</p><hr />
