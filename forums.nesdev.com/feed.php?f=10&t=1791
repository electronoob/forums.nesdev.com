Yet more questions...<br /><br />How exactly does the stack pointer work and what does it do? I'm getting different definitions from different docs.<br /><br />While looking through some homebrewed games for the NES I'm noticing headers, ".org" seems to be common to a lot of them. The 6502 stuff I'm reading doesn't mention it at all. Naturally, I'm asking: what do they do and how do they work? Also limited information on these.<br /><br />Additionally while looking through the same games, I'm seeing things like the following:<br /><br />1) SOME_NAME = SOME_MEMORY_ADDRESS_OR_NUMBER<br /><br />2) SOME_NAME    dc.b<br />3) SOME_NAME    ds.b<br /><br />And strange (well I haven't seen it in the docs) subroutine stuff like:<br /><br />4) SOME_NAME:<br />5) .SOME_NAME<br />6) SOME_NAME subroutine (following this would sometimes include the .SOME_NAME form)<br /><br />Of course, again, none of the docs I'm reading explain stuff like this. I can only guess that the different subrountine forms are personal preference or something (different syntax maybe?).<br /><br />Thank you for any help.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=759">random</a> — Mon Jul 10, 2006 2:40 pm</p><hr />

If you want to check for multiple cases you could do a CMP and a branch for each one. Preferably with the most probable cases first, so that the program doesn't get too slow.<br /><br />To work with numbers larger than 8 bits, you make use of the carry flag. This code does a 16-bit addition:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">   clc      ;clear the carry so that you don't add an unwanted &quot;1&quot;<br />   lda VarLo   ;take the low byte of a variable<br />   adc #&lt;657   ;add the low byte of the number &quot;657&quot;<br />   sta VarLo   ;the low byte is ready to be stored back, but if the result was more than 255, the carry will be set<br />   lda VarHi   ;load the high byte of the variable<br />   adc #&gt;657   ;add the high byte of the number &quot;657&quot; and a possible &quot;1&quot; if there was an overflow in the low byte<br />   sta VarHi   ;store the final high byte</div><br /><br />You just have to clear the carry (or set it, if you are subtracting) before adding the first pair of bytes, and then add each of the following pairs at a time, from the least significant one to the most significant one. The carry flag will take care of propagating any carry, and you'll get the correct answer at the end.<br /><br />The 6502 can handle signed and unsigned numbers. Although there is no difference between them until you perform some sort of calculation or comparison on them. The hex value $FF can be a decimal 255 or a -1. It's up to how you interpret the number.<br /><br />Addition and subtraction of signed and unsigned numbers is the same, there is not a single difference, but depending on whether you consider the numbers signed or unsigned, you have to interpret the result differently. BPL and BMI are used to check for a negative or positive result, of course, if you are using signed numbers. BCC and BCS can be used to find wich of two unsigned numbers is larger.<br /><br />When you compare 2 numbers, the rule is: If they are signed, use BPL and BMI, if they are unsigned, use BCC and BCS.<br /><br />Also, when working with signed numbers larger than 1 byte, only the last (most significant) byte should be considered signed. You could get a little confused with this. I was when I first started studying ASM.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Jul 09, 2006 11:22 am</p><hr />

No more, no less.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />For instance if I wanted to perform larger (&gt; 8-bits) calculations.<br /></div><br /><br />This is what the C flag (carry flag) in the processor status register is for.  for example, if you want to add 2 16-bit numbers together, you'd add the low 8-bits of each together first, and then if the result was &gt;= $100, the C flag will be set, which will allow you to add it into the addition of the high 8-bits of each number.<br /><br />That explaination wasn't bery good.  Remeber that if C is set at the time of ADC, an extra 1 will be added to the sum:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">CLC ; clear carry initially<br /><br />; add low bytes together<br />LDA valueA_low<br />ADC valueB_low<br />STA sum_low   ; store the sum -- note that if the sum was &gt; $FF, C is set<br /><br />LDA valueA_hi<br />ADC valueB_hi<br />STA sum_hi<br /></div><br /><br />Consider you have the following 2 16-bit numbers that you want to add:<br />$0362<br />$04F3<br /><br />first you clear C (CLC) so the extra 1 won't be in your addition... then you add the low bytes of the numbers together:<br />$62 + $F3 = $55  &lt;-- note that the sum is $55 and not $155 (because it can only be 8-bits).  However because it was greater than $FF, C is now set.<br /><br />So now you add the high bytes together:  $03 + $04 = $08  &lt;---  note that it's $08 because C is set by the previous addition, so the extra 1 got added.<br /><br />therefore... $0362 + $04F3 = $0855.<br /><br /><br />C works in a similar fashion for multi-byte ASL/ROL/LSR/ROR commands.  And works "backwards" for SBC, but the same logic applies.[/quote]<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I'm kind of hazy on how 6502 handles signed and unsigned numbers, explanation would be helpful. I'm getting the impression that it only has signed ones.<br /></div><br /><br />Well, it doesn't handle them at all really.  In fact, if anything I'd say the numbers are all unsigned.<br /><br />What really makes a number signed or unsigned is how your program treats it.  The processor doesn't care one way or the other.  $FF can be either 255 or -1.... the processor will always treat it the same regardless -- what matters is how your program works with the number.<br /><br />There is a "N" flag in the processor status reg, which will be set if the result of the last operation was negative and cleared if the result was positive.  All "negative" really means here is "the high bit is set".  For this purpose, $00-7F are all "positive" numbers, and $80-FF are all "negative".  However, again, the processor doesn't treat them any differently if they're positive or negative.... it kind of treats them all like they're positive ($80 + $80 will give you 256, not -256)<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />How do you end a branch?<br /></div><br /><br />Branches behave just like jumps, only they will only jump under certain conditions.  The condition is the current status of a status flag.  Usually you will work with BNE, BEQ, BCC, and BCS.<br /><br />BNE will jump if and only if the Z status flag is clear<br />BEQ will jump if and only if the Z status flag is set<br />BCC will jump if C is clear<br />BCS will jump is C is set<br /><br /><strong>HOW</strong> these flags gets set is determined by the instruction(s) before the branch.<br /><br />Therefore in your examples:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />lda some_variable<br />cmp some_other_variable<br />beq exe_this_code<br /></div><br /><br /><br />that CMP instruction is comparing two values.  CMP will set Z if the values equal each other, and will clear Z if the values do not equal each other.  If you want to get into details, CMP actually performs a subtraction, and Z is set to the result of that subtraction -- and if the two numbers equal each other, the result is Zero, so Z is set.  If the result is nonzero (the numbers don't equal each other), Z will be clear.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDA #$03   ; Z=clear<br />CMP #$03  ; Z=set &#40;3-3 = 0 -- a result of 0 = Z set&#41;<br />BEQ somewhere  ; jump to 'somewhere' only if Z is set &#40;which it was set by last instruction&#41;<br /><br />LDA #$00  ; value of $00 = Z set<br />BNE somewhere  ; this will not jump anywhere because Z is set by above LDA<br />BEQ somewhere  ; this WILL jump because Z is set by previous LDA<br /></div><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />But what if I want multiple branches?<br /></div><br /><br />You can branch as many times as you want, there's no limit.  Remember that all the branches look at is the status flags, so to really understand branches, you have to understand how the status flags are set.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Sun Jul 09, 2006 11:01 am</p><hr />

That was just why I say Nesticle is good to discover the PPU : It allow you to see tiles and edit them. FCEUXD, VirtuaNES and possibly Nintendulator allow pattern table viewing, but the pattern tables are too small to allow someone to really explore the tileset, and you don't get the tile # when clicking on one, and you cannot edit it.<br /><br />I think FCEUXD is good to for this purpose, but it doesn't really replace Nesticle.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Jul 08, 2006 10:35 am</p><hr />

Nintendulator, in addition to being several times more accurate than Nesticle, is pretty good for watching pattern tables and nametables nowadays.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Jul 08, 2006 3:40 am</p><hr />
