<br />"Always" is a strong word. <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> for Wii uses cutscenes to cover up loading, and you can't make a "NOW LOADING" screen skippable now, can you? And how will you convince the lawyers to let the player skip the screen with copyright and trademark notices on it?

<br />
<br />SMG and SMG2 force the player to watch cutscenes if it's the first time they've ever entered the stage on that save file; but on any subsequent visits to that stage, the player can skip any cutscene by pressing A.

I guess if it's covering a loading screen then that's a legitimate reason for it to be not skippable.<br /><br />Although if the loading finishes before the cutscene is over, or if the loading would be faster without the cutscene, it should definitely be skippable.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And how will you convince the lawyers to let the player skip the screen with copyright and trademark notices on it?</div><br /><br />Put it in the manual, or on the title screen.<br /><br />Everyone knows things are copyrighted and trademarked.<br /><br />Having it mentioned somewhere discreet in the game will suffice for all legal purposes.  As long as it's <em>there</em>, it counts (and with copyrights I think it might count even if it isn't there).<br /><br />That kind of thing can (and should) be left to the fine print.  I shouldn't have to wait 2 minutes to view a copyright notice I've seen a million times.  That's just stupid.  It's bad enough I have to put up with that crap at the beginning of movies.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And how will you handle players who are angry that they don't know where to go because they skipped the cut scene telling them the mission objective?</div>
<br />
<br />Any of the following:
<br />
<br />1)  Don't make the mission objective so obscure that it can't be figured out with casual gameplay.
<br />2)  Have an option in the menu that says "view mission objective".
<br />3)  Have a mark on the map indicating where you go next
<br />
<br />These are all pretty typical in the games I play.

If you do things out of order, then the "!" should indicate that you need to do something else first.<br /><br />(note many games already do this.  See Borderlands for XBox 360.

That's exactly the kind of thing they get paid to look for.<br /><br />I've played games like this in the past.  Most recently was Shadow Complex for XBox 360.  It had:<br /><br />- cutscenes giving you a basic idea of what you need to do (could all be skipped)<br />- a map with a path line drawn on it telling you where you need to go (could be disabled if you choose)<br />- a brief description of your current mission at the top of the map screen.<br /><br />It was great.  I love playing that game.  Extremely high replay value.<br /><br /><br />Does it make life a little harder for the game developers?  Sure.  But so does any worthwhile game feature.  It's a tradeoff, more work for a better product.<br /><br />Skippable cutscenes make for a much better product.  Always.  I stand by that.<br /><br /><br /><br />Let me turn that around on you, too.  What if you watched the cutscene and <em>forgot</em> your objective.  Or say you saved the game mid-level and didn't play the game again for another 2 months, and when you pick it up you don't have the foggiest idea of what you were doing last time you played.<br /><br />Is the player supposed to start over?<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Also, I find it strange that you bring up a point about redundant data in a game <em>in advocacy</em> of cutscenes.  Cutscenes are pretty much always redundant.  Whatever the cutscene tells you to do will already have to be duplicated in the game logic, so you're already doubling up on information.<br /><br />/EDIT<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">3)  Have a mark on the map indicating where you go next</div><br />Which isn't ideal if one of the objectives is to extend your automap into the fog of war.</div>
<br />
<br />Well then obviously you would do one of the previous two options.

They're not jobs.  Players shouldn't have to work or suffer to play them.  They're supposed to just play them and enjoy it.  It's the programmers and game designer's job to do the actual work to make it easy/fun for the player.  That's why they make the money.<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Let me put it this way:  it's a business model.<br /><br />When I go to a restaurant, I pay the restaurant to cook me food, bring it to me, and give me whatever related service I ask for, whether it be a certain condiment, some dessert, or a refill of my drink.  They do it for me.  That's why I pay them money.<br /><br />When I go to a store, I pick out the item I want.  If I can't find it, I ask the customer service guy if he can find it for me.<br /><br />It's the old addage "the customer is always right".<br /><br />If I ask my server at a restaurant to bring me a refill of my drink and they say "do it yourself, I'm busy", that a crappy restaurant.<br /><br />If I ask a customer service guy to help me find a product and he says "that's not my job", that's a crappy store.<br /><br /><br />The business does not expect the customer to do the work.  The business does the work.  That's why it's the business.  The customer is giving money to the business so that they don't have to work.  That's the whole point.<br /><br /><br />To relate that to this gaming discussion:<br /><br />The player is the customer.  He's buying the game because he wants to be entertained.<br /><br />The game designer is the business.  He's getting paid to make an entertaining game.<br /><br />If the player asks "what am I supposed to be doing in this game now?" and the game says "tough shit, you should've watched that 5 minute cutscene at the start of the level", then that's a crappy game.<br /><br />Now I'm not saying that every game should be fun for every player.  That's obviously not realistic.  What I'm saying is that the game should cater to the player as much as possible.<br /><br />In your post:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I have no remorse for players who don't bother to sit through potentially vital information.</div>
<br />
<br />You clearly are not catering to the player.  In fact you're adamantly opposing extending service to the player.

<br />
<br />If the scenes are not just text but also graphics with people actually moving arround, they'll usually just be a lot more fun than a bunch of text.
<br />
<br />The best example is probably Chrono Trigger, which have different scenes depending on who is in your party. I guess I beat the game 5+ times and never got bored of the scenes EVER. I think I even remembered reseting the game and trying to switch party members to get another scene.
<br />
<br />Of course whenever a scene is good or bad is subjective matter. That being said - I agree with Dish that more RPGs should have somewhere that tells you what you're supposed to no next.

<br />They're not always terrible.  But they're not always something the player wants to watch.
<br />
<br />If the player wants to watch them, he can.  But if he doesn't want to, he should always be able to skip them.
<br />
<br />Also, it's "Disch".  The 'c' is for Cool.

Perhaps you can have your 2 minute cutscene, but break it up into three parts: the first minute and a half (FFing allowed), the 10 seconds that are important (no FFing unless this specific cutscene has been shown since power-on), and then the 20 second transition into gameplay (FFing allowed).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If I ask my server at a restaurant to bring me a refill of my drink and they say "do it yourself, I'm busy", that a crappy restaurant.</div><br />I take it you're not a fan of fast food with its self-service soda fountain.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If I ask a customer service guy to help me find a product and he says "that's not my job", that's a crappy store.</div><br />"That's not my department; let me get someone."<br />"Spark plugs?

<br />Then Tetrisphere is a crappy game because its rules aren't discoverable. In this game, most presses of the A button will result in damage to the player; get damaged three times in one round and your game is over. You have to find pieces that are eligible for clearing, or make them so by dragging and dropping them into place, before you line up on top of a piece and press A. But only the opening cutscene (which is skippable if it has been played at least once on that cartridge and replayable from the main menu) explains this.

Perhaps you can have your 2 minute cutscene, but break it up into three parts: the first minute and a half (FFing allowed), the 10 seconds that are important (no FFing unless this specific cutscene has been shown since power-on), and then the 20 second transition into gameplay (FFing allowed).</div><br /><br />I guess that would be an improvement, but it seems like roundabout way to make a poor design more tolerable.<br /><br />It's better if you just don't bury useful information inside something people are going to skip.<br /><br />How often is this even the case, anyway?  The only game I can remember that had important info in a cutscene was the "look at my ass" scene in Metal Gear Solid, and even that wasn't very important because you're likely to figure it out when you got spotted and the guard ran away laughing instead of shooting at you.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I take it you're not a fan of fast food with its self-service soda fountain.</div><br /><br />You get what you pay for.  If I'm paying $12 + tip for a meal, I expect service.  If I'm paying $5 for a fast food burger, I don't mind filling the paper cup myself.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">"That's not my department; let me get someone."</div><br /><br />The "let me get someone" thing is the key here.  He's not just leaving you hanging, he's still trying to help you.  If he just said "that's not my department" and then didn't do anything else, that would be lame.<br /><br />But talk about a tangent.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But does someone have to carry it to the checkout counter for you?</div><br /><br />Some places actually do that.  XD  But granted not many.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Then Tetrisphere is a crappy game because ...</div>
<br />
<br />I've never played Tetrisphere, but it sounds to me like you're comparing fundamental basics of the game to one-time plot events.
<br />
<br />That's clearly different.  RTFM if you don't understand the core game mechanics.
<br />
<br />A clever game designer will put a "how to play" or "tutorial" option on the main menu to explain the rules of the game if they aren't immediately clear... rather than automatically show a cutscene the user is likely to skip.
<br />
<br />They can choose to see the tutorial or choose not to.  But they'll know it's there, and if they can't figure out the game mechanics on their own, they'll give it a look.

Poor is a relative term.<br /><br />I have the same lack of remorse for players who don't read the manual and get upset when they don't know how to jump, or who skip the "boring tutorial" and get upset when they don't know how to equip an item...or those who don't watch a scene that gives them vital information.<br /><br />In short, the player has responsibility to absorb the information I give him if he wants to enjoy my game.  I'm not a bad designer if he refuses my help.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Watching cutscenes is not fun for a lot of people.  Especially if they've already played through the game a few times.</div><br /><br />And watching scenes is the primary reason some people play video games.  Everyone has their own tastes, and it's up to the consumer to buy games that match theirs.<br /><br />If you only like football games you shouldn't buy an RPG.  If you don't like twitch games with precise movement you shouldn't buy a shooter.  And if you don't like watching cutscenes then you shouldn't buy a cinematic, story-heavy game.<br /><br />No game developer attempts to make a game that absolutely everyone will enjoy, because the game often ends up a mess that nobody likes, mediocre in all aspects.  A good developer knows their specific target audience and makes a game tailored to them.  Nippon Ichi doesn't try to put twitch platforming in their strategy RPGs because they know their target audience doesn't want that.  Konami makes long, drawn out, highly complicated cutscenes in Metal Gear because they know their target audience wants that.  Either way, it's primarily your own fault for not researching the type of game if you buy it and end up not liking it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So yeah.  If your game is no fun, then you're right.  They should be playing a different game.  And they probably will.</div><br />"No fun" being a relative term, I would hope so!  I don't want someone writing me a nasty letter saying "yo dawg I just wanted to play some Madden but your RPG doesn't have any playbooks and I can't tackle, therefore your game sucks."<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If the cutscene is 2 seconds and says "do this" that's one thing.<br /><br />If the cutscene is 5 minutes of crap you don't care about with 2 seconds of important info buried in the middle of it, that sucks.</div><br />Hey, relative again.  Don't play the games if you think they suck, meanwhile the throng of players who do care to watch the scenes and learn secrets from them will be over here enjoying it.<br /><br />It's the same complaint from the people who don't talk to every NPC in an RPG and get lost - they think they should be able to complete the game without talking to anyone.  This is the wrong genre for that person.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If the player asks "what am I supposed to be doing in this game now?" and the game says "tough shit, you should've watched that 5 minute cutscene at the start of the level", then that's a crappy game.</div>
<br />Again: nope.
<br />
<br />You used the example of restaurants.  Here's another way to put what you're saying to me:
<br />
<br />If the customer asks "can I buy prime rib here?" and the restaurant says "tough shit, this is a Taco Bell," then that's a crappy restaurant.
<br />
<br />What I'm saying is the customer needs to pay more attention at what's being offered when they first pull into the drive through.
