		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had a nasty surprise this evening when I tested some of my experiments on a real NES. I thought I had tested this particular experiment on a real NES before, but apparently not. I'm getting nasty sprite flicker. It sucks cause this doesn't happen on any of the 4 emulators I've been testing with. 
<br />
<br />The only thing I can think is maybe I've written some highly inefficient, cycle-heavy code and it is going past the length of one vblank (but shouldn't an accurate emulator catch this?). In fact, I did add one (harmless) instruction in my code and the flicker got worse...that would lend credence to that possibility would it not?

<br />
<br />My program is an experiment with displaying meta-sprites. In my current test program, I am displaying two meta sprites. If each meta sprite is composed of 8 sprites (4 wide x2 high), there is no flicker. If each meta sprite is composed of more than this, the sprites begin to flicker.  The max size I've tried is two meta sprites which are 4x4 sprites. From what I understood from documentation, this would bring the max sprites per scanline to 8 (if the two meta sprites are positioned next to each other), which is the max allowed for the NES. I assumed when I read that that there would be no flicker...is that incorrect?
<br />
<br />*edit*  Upon modifying my test programs, when I displayed two 4x4 meta sprites, the flicker did begin to show up in both Nestopia and Nintendulator. There seems to be a small discrepancy between these emulators and the real hardware for when flicker begins occurring (based on no. of sprites)
<br />
<br />*edit* I found tepples' post

<br />
<br />Also, be sure to do a sprite DMA every vblank, as sprite attribute RAM contents may deteriorate if untouched for a while (not sure of this myself). This effect is also not emulated.

This looks like my rendering is taking longer than vblank. Maybe I should test in PAL mode to confirm this.  *edit*  sure enough, no problems in pal mode in nintendulator.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you haven't implemented a "flicker" routine and all sprites hold the same places in the OAM page every frame, the sprites should not flicker at all. Have you ever played SMB1 and watched one of those pulley-platforms disappear when on the same scanline as another? That's what it should look like. One and only one should completely disappear.
<br />
<br />My guess is it's something kind of unnatural, like a PPU glitch. Always be very aware of how long your Vblank code takes. You should count the cycles. If it works in PAL mode like you said, it's very possible this is what's happening.

<br />
<br />I don't know how long it takes to enable/disable rendering, but I put some loops in there which, if I've done my arithmetic right, take 1402 cycles. Where are the remaining 600+ cycles going?

<br />Does there exist a good reference for determining how many cpu cycles each instruction takes? I erroneously assumed the number in a certain column in a 6502 reference was the # of cycles, rather than the size of the instruction in memory...my bad.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks to you guys, I've had a leap of understanding about programming for the NES this evening. So, vblank is only around 2000 cycles long, that must mean there's quite a lot more cycles available while the PPU is rendering. Thus, I would imagine game engines are (often, I realize there is more than one way to do this) set up roughly as follows:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">loop:<br /><br />;wait for frame to begin &#40;perhaps wait for our vblank to end with a simple flag&#41;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; ;none of this code will update graphics or sound, just make various game related calculations &#40;which may be quite CPU intensive, thus this is the most appropriate place for them&#41;<br />&nbsp; jsr updateAllGameObjectsAndAI<br /><br />&nbsp; jmp loop<br /><br />vblank:<br /><br />&nbsp; ;all of these update graphics and sound as calculated by the game engine during the previous frame<br />&nbsp; jsr updateSprites&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;sprite DMA<br />&nbsp; jsr updateBackground ;scrolling, nametable updates<br />&nbsp; jsr updateSound&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;sound and music engine<br /><br />&nbsp; ;set a flag so the game engine knows it can do whatever it wants til the next vblank is called<br /><br />&nbsp; rti</div>

To me, that's not even a newbie way of doing it; it's more complex than the standard way to do it:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">-<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda $2002<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bmi -<br /></div>
<br />
<br />And besides, you wouldn't need to clear the carry in that loop, as it gets overwritten with the value shifted into it.
<br />
<br />I'm pretty sure you're right though about the game loop thing, just it's executed differently (probably with no polling). You never want the game loop to run at more than 60/50 Hz (either NTSC or PAL), and you never want the NMI to update data when its not ready. So that basically means you should have flags and stuff that indicate whether or not the data is ready. Though whether or not this approach is worth the complexity is debatable.
