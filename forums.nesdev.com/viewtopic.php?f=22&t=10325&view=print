When you drop in the bottom and no platform is in your way, you'll end upfalling from to to the bottom again, and again etc. Meanwhile, gravity will increase to ridiculous point and, after some more time, it will reset itself to zero. It's not a big bug or anything, but I'd fix it by limiting gravity max potential at some point.<br /><br />You can exit &quot;extra&quot; menu by selecting empty option:<br /><img src="http://img33.imageshack.us/img33/2865/41d5.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />And it's never mentioned about SELECT button functionality-you can skip levels with it(debug leftover?)<br /><br />Overall, this is great, and multiplayer adds to it's greatness. I'm gonna play it with bro later. Thanks <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I limited both player and enemy gravity to falling 8 pixels per frame, and reduced the &quot;extra&quot; menu to three items.<br /><br />The blank slot on it was from back when I thought I was going to go over the limit for NROM-128 and I would have unused space in the 32kb of PRG ROM to add in more stuff that would warrant another menu item, but I made it fit.<br /><br />I also left the select key level skipping on purpose, and FHBG had a debug key too. I figured it would be convenient for someone who just wanted to check out the levels and the title screen already lets you skip ahead to level 13 or 25 if you want. Select could be repurposed into being an &quot;insert coin&quot; button if I did a version that took the arcade style further and tried to make it like an actual arcade game and didn't want users to be able to skip.

Or you could use the method that Thwaite and <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=10144" class="postlink">PyFHBG</a> use: a &quot;practice&quot; option in the menu.

If you want to make a arcade game with insert coin, you could use the Vs.System function for that, though.
