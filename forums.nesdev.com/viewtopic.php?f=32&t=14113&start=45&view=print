You only got 8KB of prg rom, and Chr-ram.  I don't think we'll be doing a category 3 this time since we only had 3 submissions last time.  One could still submit an 8KB game but that's your own artificial limit make it what you want.

These include NROM (#0) with CHR ROM, NROM with CHR RAM, CNROM (#3), BNROM (#34), AMROM/ANROM (#7), UNROM (#2), and inverted UNROM (#180). These also include CNROM or UNROM bank switching with AxROM-style switchable 1-screen mirroring, which currently lack distinct mapper numbers.<br /><br />And no, NROM isn't a subset of UNROM. It's a subset of CNROM (if it has CHR ROM) or BNROM (if it has CHR RAM).<br /><br />If I sponsor a water-themed category, it'll probably have a 7K limit for PRG + CHR, as the kanji for water (æ°´) resembles &quot;7K&quot;.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm a bit confused about the size limits and mappers allowed.<br /><br />I could go for CNROM and forget about it, but as all my NES development has been based around NROM, CNROM, and GNROM-like mappers (where the full 32K is switched at once), I'd like to use this compo for my first &quot;partial&quot; romspace mapping, i.e., using UNROM.<br /><br />UNROM allows for 4 or 8 banks of 16K PRG + 8K CHR (that makes 72K). A limit of 64K means that I can use 3 banks of PRG to make room for the CHR bank?<br /><br />EDIT: Forget what I said. Now I understand UNROM uses CHR RAM. Great, now it's time to find a good pattern compressor <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

I have set up a very simple example where the main code in the main area pages in a bank with compressed CHR data and puts it into CHR-RAM, then pages yet another bank and executes a function which draws some patterns on screen. That should get people going, specially those who know the inner workins of Neslib but only have coded NROM or CNROM games.<br /><br />The only thing I still have to solve has to be with famitone. I want to have song data split across banks, and I have to research on how to do it.
