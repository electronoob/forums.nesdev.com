<br />
<br />Well, im here to ask if anyone is interesting in this proyect...

<br />
<br />We are actually few persons. The idea of this, is have some kind of website that we can manage the files "easly" and give rights to ppl to edit the archive itself, if they have some kind of "reputation" to do it.
<br />
<br />Actually there are about 4700+ Nsfs. From original Artist, compos, compilations, etc.
<br />But, the idea is to have an ARTIST page where you can check the info, NSFs, Compilations, Sources, etc. Also have a PLAYER, since there is a FLASH player outside, we could implement this to the website.
<br />
<br />We are loocking for somebody that could help us in the code part. Especially to start with the website itself. The organizacion is "the easy part".
<br />
<br />I honestly dont know if there is somebody outthere working on this already. But, if it, please let me know.

<br />Shouldn't that exclude the covers folder too? Or by "copyrights" do you refer only to copyright in the playback engine, not copyright in the musical work?

<br />
<br />Yah, what "we" mean for copyright is basically for commercial game releases. And mainly because we are interested in "new" composers. But i personaly think we could do something like this...
<br />
<br />We could have some kind of Composer/Artist page from original and commercial games. I mean, like we plan to have for "new musicians/composers". With the respective list of games the artist/composer did for commercial games.
<br />
<br />Nothing in the "archive" itself is definitive. The idea is "work toghether" if is possible, since there is no real "archive" for the NSFs composer/artists, and there are TONS of new music out there.
<br />
<br />Thx for reading

<br />My understanding is that covers are only illegal if they're for-profit and the original artist doesn't receive compensation. Exact reproduction of programming code is more like mp3/flac sharing...legal if you own the original game, maybe.....
<br />
<br />It's splitting hairs though. The real reason to separate commercial NSFs from non is that they're two different things.

For profit or not for profit doesn't enter into it unless you can cite one of the limitations set forth in 17 USC 107 through 123 or foreign counterparts. Or do you plan to proceed based on the service providers' exemption (17 USC 512 and foreign counterparts), where the representative of a copyright owner can request a takedown? Otherwise, someone might upload "the complete works of Phil Collins and GeNESis" using WAV-to-NSF tools (which aren't exactly impossible to build).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">cak wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The real reason to separate commercial NSFs from non is that they're two different things.</div>
<br />The programmer of a classic game's music engine releases the music engine's source code. Is that "commercial NSFs"?
<br />
<br />A homebrew game gets reissued in a commercial "deluxe version" with extra missions, extra cutscenes, and a mission editor, and it uses the same music engine and the same sequence data as the homebrew. (This was my original plan for Concentration Room.) Is that "commercial NSFs"?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey tepples and cak
<br />
<br />@tepples, im agree with what you mean. I understand the point. But as i said, by now we just want "original" from new musician/artists.
<br />Actually if you read the post. We are saying:
<br />- I don't want my files include in the Archive, What should i do?
<br />Ok, just let us know so we can delete from the oficial release.
<br />
<br />Btw, about this...
<br />Otherwise, someone might upload "the complete works of Phil Collins and GeNESis" using WAV-to-NSF tools (which aren't exactly impossible to build).
<br />
<br />That's why the "archive" is not public anywhere and not many ppl have access by now, and that's why i said about the "reputation" system to upload files. And even after upload, admins/modarators have to be agree/check the files to make them public. So it shouldnt be so hard to keep an oder, once the website has those things... but as i said, before anything, we need a website! XDDDD
<br />which is the complicated part, other that i think, i personally im open to any suggest. 
<br />
<br />Hope more people get around and want to get into.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@tepples I stand corrected concerning copyright law. As for "commercial nsfs", I simply meant game soundtracks from the original NES/Famicom era. Those and modern chiptunes belong to separate eras, and thus shouldn't be mixed indiscriminately, like on Modland for instance.
