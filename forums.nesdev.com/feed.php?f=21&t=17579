man, phase distortion, I thought that was only something you heard on Star Trek<br /><br />anyways, I was looking up colors and the color named &quot;periwinkle&quot; or &quot;lavender&quot; appears very similar to the color $22 on many LCD displays.

Reflections themselves may not cause differential phase distortion. But different reflections can cause differently-spaced comb filtering, which will cause different cancellations of original signal components, in turn causing different changes in amplitude, causing different phase distortion in any powered stage on the part of the TV set that displays the signal.<br /><br />The AN-500B is stable across all TVs, capture cards, cables and sockets that I have tried. The AN-505BK is stable with the capture card, but highly variable when connected to several different Sony TVs. The same Sony TVs show stable colors with other home computers and consoles.<br /><br />In other words, both the AN-505BK and all my Sony TVs have some kind of electrical characteristic that only together cause phase distortion beyond what I described in that palette thread. I don't know how to measure the impedance of any input or output, but from what I have read, it's not as simple as holding an Ohmmeter to it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=133">NewRisingSun</a> — Wed Jul 25, 2018 2:20 am</p><hr />

that's an interesting thought about developers developing on a different PPU than the one that was in most people's systems.. seems like that would cause all sorts of color problems.<br /><br />I still don't get why all the &quot;accurate&quot; palettes show $22 as much more purple than this CRT is showing it, and the yellow/brown $x8 column has almost no green in it on this CRT as well.  It's frustrating having such a wide range of colors from emulators to TVs.  I guess that's just part of NES graphic development, having to accept that the colors will not be the same on all systems.  It's hard to pick which one to be the &quot;definitive&quot; color set too, especially these days where most people are likely to play on an emulator.. 10 years ago it was easier, almost everyone used FCEUX, but now people use emulators, virtual consoles and &quot;NES classic&quot; emulator consoles, all of which also display things differently from the original console<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3841">frantik</a> — Tue Jul 24, 2018 7:43 pm</p><hr />
