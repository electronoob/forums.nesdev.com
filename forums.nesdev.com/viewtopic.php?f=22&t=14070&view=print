		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I wanted to learn how to program NES games so I threw together a little game in two weeks to learn how. The game is called &quot;Ralph 4&quot;, and it is a sequel to the very first game I ever created: &quot;Ralph 1&quot;, which was made using Gamemaker in the year 2004.<br /><br /><s>The game is mostly finished, but it is lacking music and sounds. It would be much appreciated if anyone on these forums would be willing to contribute Famitone2 tracks &#40;without DPCM&#41; to be used in the game.</s><br /><br /><strong>Update:</strong> Music and sound have been added by <a href="http://battleofthebits.org/barracks/Profile/MovieMovies1/" class="postlink">MovieMovies1</a>.<br /><br />Also, I would be interested in gauging how difficult the game is. It takes me about 10 minutes to beat all the levels, but this isn't a very useful metric considering I'm the creator. What I want to know is how long it takes to beat on a blind play. If any of you are able to beat the game then please post your times.<br /><br />The game has been tested on FCEUX and Nestopia, though I haven't tested it on a real NES. Hopefully it will work.<br /><br />Here are two screenshots:<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KiNeGlJ.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Wq0k7Mg.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Anyways, thanks for the great forum and wiki, and especially thanks to Tepples and Shiru their great resources. <img src="./images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" /> <br /><br />The ROM should be attached (ralph4.nes is the newer one). The code is on Github: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/pubby/Ralph-4">https://github.com/pubby/Ralph-4</a><!-- m -->

I was thinking about adding an easy mode or something, but I figured that if I wanted to create more content then my time would be better served working on a newer/better game than Ralph.

Many of them are familiar with FamiTracker and most have a higher level of technical understanding.  Having them export to FamTone2 and optimizing for it shouldn't be much of an issue as we usually hold compos on who can create small/optimized songs.<br /><br />Cheers.

I take it that contacting individual artists would be the way to go? I saw something about contests there, but I'm guessing that option would be inappropriate/out of my league for a little game like Ralph 4.

If you so desire you could also talk to one of the admins or venerable regulars to post a bulletin scheduling the time of the battle to win the ability to create a soundtrack for you; providing the expectations.<br /><br />I am a long-standing administrator for the site.  Let me know if I can be additional support on our forums or on the IRC channel: (EsperNet #botb)<br /><br />(The site has somewhat of a learning curve.  Feel free to meander and lurk, or jump in and ask questions.)
