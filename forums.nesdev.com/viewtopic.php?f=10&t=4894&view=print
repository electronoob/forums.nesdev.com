		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey all
<br />
<br />After sometime messing with metroid, I found that is uses extra RAM stored in the cartridge... 
<br />
<br />Is this RAM called wram, or sram? I'm not a nes expert, but this ram is the same used to save games? I am right?
<br />
<br />well, if so, why nintendo didnt use a battery to keep this ram, and save the game state? I cant understand why they created that funky password system to continue the game...
<br />
<br />Cheers

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not sure on the technical difference of the terms 'PRG-RAM' / 'SRAM' / 'WRAM'.  As far as I can tell all 3 seem to be interchangable, with the possible exception being that SRAM is used to save data whereas PRG-RAM and WRAM don't, necessarily.
<br />
<br />Lots of NES games have additional RAM on cartridge because the NES has so little internally.  Games often just use it for additional workspace, and not necessarily to save games.  In order for SRAM to save games, it would need to be backed with a battery so that the RAM has a steady power source to keep it up when it's not in the NES.  Metroid probably didn't have a battery -- it probably only had the RAM.
<br />
<br />Metroid is also a port of an FDS game -- which <em>did</em> have saved games.  FDS games had a lot more space for RAM, and could save by writing data back to the floppy disk.
<br />
<br />Perhaps in the conversion to the cartridge, they ran out of RAM and didn't have enough left over to hold saved games.  Though I find this unlikely because a saved game in metroid can't be very big.
<br />
<br />That's a total guess though.  Maybe they just didn't want to shell out the extra money to put batteries in every cartridge.  Or maybe they didn't think to battery back RAM to save games back then (Metroid was a relatively early NES title).

<br />
<br />Yep, but having Zelda as example, the game was released on the same year, I think 1986, and included a battery backed saver.
<br />
<br />I think I got the meaning for (s)(w)(prg)-RAM,  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />
<br />Yes, I could not get zelda running until I wrote te sram code. the game crashes as soon start is pressed.
<br />
<br />Metroid shows a blank screen and you cant move anywhere, if no sram is present.
