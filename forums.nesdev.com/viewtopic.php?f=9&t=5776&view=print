		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My NES tracker is now using MMC1 so that I can have the editor in fixed ROM and the music player in another bank, switching banks in the NMI to call the player refresh.
<br />
<br />At the moment I've only got a dummy routine for the music refresh (as there's no music code yet), simply incrementing a ZP variable (so I can check it's getting there) and RTS.
<br />
<br />I'm setting the bank with this routine;
<br />
<br />setPRGBank	sta $E000
<br />	lsr a
<br />	sta $E000
<br />	lsr a
<br />	sta $E000
<br />	lsr a
<br />	sta $E000
<br />	lsr a
<br />	sta $E000
<br />	rts
<br />
<br />So, in the NMI, with the dummy music player in bank 1;
<br />
<br />lda #$01
<br />jsr setPRGBank
<br />jsr musicRefresh
<br />lda #$00
<br />jsr setPRGBank
<br />
<br />When running the ROM in Nestopia, it works fine. However, using the same ROM in PowerPak causes a lock-up. If I comment out the bank switch and music refresh call in the NMI, it works.
<br />
<br />Anyone?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1) Are you initialising the MMC1 in your RESET vector code?  LDA #$80 / STA $FFFF should be sufficient according to <a href="http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/mmc1/index.html" class="postlink">kevtris's MMC1 doc</a>.
<br />
<br />2a) How are you setting up MMC1?  Specifically, register 0 (writes to $8000-9FFF).  Bits #2 and #3 matter greatly here.
<br />
<br />2b) I believe kevtris's MMC1 doc has a mistake when talking about H=1 in register 0; it states when H=1, $C000-FFFF (16KB) is fixed and $8000-FFFF (32KB) is swappable.  Pretty sure he means $C000-FFFF (16KB) is fixed and $8000-BFFF (16KB) is swappable, given that his later description of register 3's "P" bits state that only full 32KB swaps happen when H=0.
<br />
<br />3) Where's your NMI routine located at, CPU addressing space-wise?  If it's in the PRG swappable area, you'll need to make sure a copy of your NMI routine exists in every PRG page you'll be swapping in.
<br />
<br />4) Same question as #3, but for your musicRefresh routine.
<br />
<br />5) Are all of your routines properly .ORG'd?  Meaning: if the code is assembled to assume a base origin of $C000 and you end up swapping that PRG bank into $8000........  ;-)
<br />
<br />6) Possibly this is the result of you assuming the wrong PRG bank is whats loaded on start-up (e.g. Nestopia might load a certain PRG bank at boot, while PowerPak might load a different one).  I remember there being a debate/discussion over which PRG bank, at power-on, in the ROM image itself gets loaded into $8000-BFFF and which gets loaded into $C000-FFFF.

<br />I guess that means that despite the bank switching, the JSR to the dummy music refresh is actually just going to the start of the editor.asm file ($8000 in bank 0).

Have you tried getting the assembler to generate a source listing (if this is ASM6, try using the dash-ell flag) and seeing if the assembled address of the JSR is correct?  Could be an assembler bug is what I'm getting at.
<br />
<br />If it turns out to be: funny timing.  I tried out ASM6 today and not more than 5 minutes into using it did I find some kind of text parsing bug with regards to the ORG directive.  *dun dun dun*  :)

<br />Heh <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Actually, I have made some (very minor) changes to ASM6 before - I'd put a couple of requests into Loopy but in the meantime I figured out how to bodge them in myself. He did a better job. It is difficult to follow the code but it works <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />So you think my issue is definitely an ASM6 bug?

<br />
<br />Regarding possible ASM6 bugs: use the dash-ell flag with ASM6 and review the output.  If the assembler is correctly calculating the 16-bit address of musicRefresh (based on the source file and the ORG directive for that file or section of code), then there's no bug.
<br />
<br />My concern was with whether or not ASM6 was calculating the address wrong, since the label (address) you're JSRing to is in a different file.  But today is my first encounter with ASM6, so what the hell do I know about it (I'm serious!).
<br />
<br />A PRG bank count that isn't 2^n (n = PRG bank count) could most definitely cause what you're seeing; possibly the PowerPak does something funky in that situation (e.g. loads a PRG bank different than the one you'd expect).  Also remember that PRG bank numbers start at 0, not 1.  Anyway, bunnyboy would have to confirm.
<br />
<br />If Nestopia is permitting bank counts that don't match a power of 2, this could be considered either a bug or a feature depending on how you see it.  Ideally you'd expect the emulator to say "PRG bank count must be a value of 2^n", but then again, it's an emulator.  :-)

I was able to catch many bugs in my own programs with it. Set a breakpoint near the bankswitching and see if everything works as you expected (it correctly jumps to the music refresh routine). Of course, do try the dummy bank thing as well.
