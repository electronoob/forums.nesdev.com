It is notable for its many antropomorphic tribes. Mutant year zero was overhauled (and released in english) as a more streamlined role playing game this decade where every module brought a campaign laid out to minimize the workload of the dungeon master.<br /><br />Anyway, it seems there's an x-com like video game coming out this year, which evidently take place on a suspiciously sunny day in Gothenburg, where i live. The theme park shown in the trailer is called Liseberg and you see gothia towers next to the park... though they show 4. I guess they built a fourth one between now and the apocalypse. Lastly: the concrete fundaments in gothia towers were made in my old hometown 100km east of gothenburg. I'll think of that if i get a chance to play this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wow, a friend of mine just shared this video, he's been working on the game for the past year or so. I didn't recognize Gothenburg in the video though (but I'll visit you guys in May for Retrospelsmässan!) I think they hired a bunch of people who got laid off when Square Enix decided to pull the plug on Io Interarctive.

My wife and her parents spent a couple of days there six years ago and quite enjoyed their visit. I love Swedes in general (albeit not the feminist-minded PC ones) and am looking forward to this trip.  There's no chance for me at all to visit Retrospelmässan, unfortunately. :-(
