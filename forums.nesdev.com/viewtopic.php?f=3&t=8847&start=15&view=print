Memory chips are only available in power-of-two sizes, so it's only logical that you need an image that fills the entire chip. After all, a <strong>ROM</strong> file is just a container for images of <strong>ROM</strong> chips, so if it doesn't have a power-of-two size it's not a complete image.
<br />
<br />And don't give me that "you can use more than 1 chip and their sizes will add up to to a non-power-of-two size" crap, because at such small sizes it would never make sense to use 2 chips instead of one, considering you'd even need some extra parts to select between the 2 chips. Not cheaper or easier in any way.
<br />
<br />Is it really worth giving people compatibility issues just to save a few KB in your ROM file?
<br />
<br />PS: Sorry for the rant.

You take your emulator's source code (and that of the helper application you use for audio or whatever), zip it up, pad the zipfile to 8192 bytes at the <em>front</em>, and then append it as the final bank. (I haven't tried this.)

<br />Not all <em>software</em> developers are familiar with how <em>hardware</em> works, and the requirement that ROM sizes be a power of 2 is not intuitive; it needs to be explained/indicated.
<br />
<br />Developers who are aware of this but still refuse to abide by it are just lousy developers who only want their software to work in a couple of specific emulators. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That and in the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS scenes, it was common for games to fill only about 5/8 to 3/4 of the ROM. GBA flash cartridge writing software would cut off zero- or FF-filled space at the end of the ROM in order to fit more games onto a 256 Mbit or 512 Mbit cartridge. So would DS patching software in order to fit more games onto a 2 GB microSD card, the biggest that would work with the older (pre-SDHC) adapters.

<br />That just makes me cringe. They honestly couldn't optimize their existing code and data to fit within 4/4? Maybe I'm just old fashioned. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />Anyway, after thinking it over, a good way to pad an NES rom out to the appropriate size would be to either duplicate the last bank over and over, or insert some blank banks before the last one. That way, your "last bank" physically becomes the last bank on the ROM, and you don't need to modify any code.

<br />
<br />Allright, interesting. So the read buffer indeed survives even 7 seconds of not-touching, even when rendering is enabled, and it is not overwritten by any other PPU function. That is what I wanted to find out in the first place. It's like a 8-bit register.
<br />
<br />I still wonder about the occassional failing of #63. (Sprite 0 hit by poking data directly into $2003/2004). I don't know how that can happen.
<br />And also, why the palette-writing loop presumably sometimes fails (without would explain the cascading fails of #7, #50, #51 and #52).
<br />The loop is executed as follows (immediately after waiting for a vblank):
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .pushseg<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .segment &quot;RODATA&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @pal:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp;2&nbsp; &nbsp;3&nbsp; &nbsp;4&nbsp; &nbsp;5&nbsp; &nbsp;6&nbsp; &nbsp;7&nbsp; &nbsp;8&nbsp; &nbsp;9&nbsp; &nbsp;A&nbsp; &nbsp;B&nbsp; &nbsp;C&nbsp; &nbsp;D&nbsp; &nbsp;E&nbsp; &nbsp;F<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $1b,$3B,$16,$00,$05,$16,$18,$35,$39,$0A,$2D,$1B,$26,$1D,$36,$0E<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $13,$29,$3A,$22,$00,$35,$07,$2D,$07,$36,$2B,$3C,$2F,$2E,$12,$06<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .popseg<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; Set a completely random &#40;predefined&#41; palette<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; In a conforming implementation, the writes to $3F00,$3F04 etc.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; will be overwritten by writes to $3F10,$3F14 etc.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; Set PPUADDR before every write so that this test does not depend<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; on proper implementation of automatic address-incrementing.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bit PPUSTATUS&nbsp; &nbsp;;4 clocks<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ldx #0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;2 clocks<br />:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$3F&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;2 clocks<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sta PPUADDR&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;4 clocks<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stx PPUADDR&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;4 clocks<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lda @pal,x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;5 clocks<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sta PPUDATA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;4 clocks<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inx&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;2 clocks<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cpx #32&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;2 clocks<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bcc :-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;3 clocks<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;-1 clocks<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; Total: 4+2 + &#40;2+4+4+5+4+2+2+3&#41;*32 - 1 clocks = 837 clocks.</div>
<br />According to my calculation, this should be in no danger of leaking outside the vblank clockwise, either. (And rendering is disabled in any case.)
<br />However, the routine that waits for vblank just before this code, blanks portions of the palette. Maybe there is a random problem with rewriting the contents of the palette many times in a row on the real PPU?
<br />
<br />Re: The feature request, I'll see about it in a few days.
