No, ionustron, we're not against expansion chips ! What you made is in fact very cool. It's true the N106 is REALLY overkill, but it's nice to use it anyway !<br />The only thing I'd be against is people that use more than an expansion chip at a time. I happened to find a .nsf of Chrono Cross' intro which sounded good but it was using FDS + N106 + VRC7 which noes not make any sense. <br /><br />It would never be possible to convert it on .nes format, let alone to a cartridge. Also, it's not possible to test N106 stuff on the real hardware with a real N106 because all known carts are made of non-replacable epoxy blobs, but what you did with the N106 is cool nevertheless.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Aug 20, 2010 2:37 am</p><hr />

Very cool! When you said that, it made me wonder if anyone has attempted to make music out of modem signals. Not a remix, but software hacks to send tones to the thing, kinda like how some very very old computers sent signals to separate radio speakers to hear simple music....<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4342">ionustron</a> — Thu Aug 19, 2010 7:09 pm</p><hr />

I thought of simulating noise with pitched channels back when I was trying to make pretend modem sounds with an IBM PC's beeper in QBasic. Early 300 baud POTS modems used ITU V.21, a primitive form of frequency modulation. This gave way to phase modulation at 1200 bps, then various QAM rates up to 33600 bps.<br /><br />As for wank: I seem to remember that the minimalistic soundtrack of Metroid was Hip Tanaka's response to the epidemic of wank among NES composers at the time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Aug 19, 2010 5:07 pm</p><hr />

Performance post in performance topic  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I don't think most folks enjoy talking about expansion chip music, or they just complain that we're not limiting ourselves enough or some crap, but I have to face facts that back in the early 2000s when I jumped from listening to game soundtracks in emulated formats to beginnings of nsf homebrew, Moondemo was <em>one</em> of the things that blew my mind.<br /><br />People love to complain about wank. Sometimes, I find it rightfully so. That's why whenever I took part in a famicompo, I tried to introduce something I learned from screwing 'round with the N106 in mml. I'm sure someone happened upon sweeping through custom patterns mid-note, since it's all over the square waves, or C64, FM synth, etc... tepples had a wonderful name for the effect some thread back but I don't remember the name. Soft sampling is all that comes to mind, but I know that isn't it. I got some slap bass and violins out of it that made me generally happy.<br /><br />Eventually I got concerned about relying on DPCM with the expanded sound. Lately I've been trying to make good <a href="http://2a03.free.fr/dl.php?file=1607" class="postlink">Percussion sound</a> with the channels. Last Famicompo I was trying to make a good sounding Timpani for a cover, when I completely stumbled upon an effect I was thinking about how to create for awhile: <a href="http://2a03.free.fr/dl.php?file=2446" class="postlink">simulated noise.</a> Granted, for that while I wanted to try to make DPCM in a way that would make a good looped noise sound on that channel, while being a single finite pattern...but this works too!<br /><br />(also, now that I think about it, TONs of early arcade games I bet did the same sort of thing when trying to make noisy explosions. Gorf comes to mind.)<br /><br />(ALSO, I find it really really cool hearing noise like effects out of the squarewaves on Neil's pulsar tracker!)<br /><br />This years compo, I wanna take the concepts further but since I'm not an actual <em>coder,</em> I've about run into the limits of what I can think of doing useful with the chip. The last thing I'd love to see is someone simulate prerendered soundwaves similar to how FM synth channels have been used on the Genesis to add extra pcm effects.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4342">ionustron</a> — Thu Aug 19, 2010 4:32 pm</p><hr />

Hey, that's pretty cool.<br /><br />Another technique I used once was stringing together a bunch of small samples by using the DMC IRQ to trigger the next one.  Doesn't seem to be done much.

This effect originally sounded horrible because of the squares resetting each frame in MCK back then... dunno if this one is corrected (I think it is, NSFPlug may be fooling me though).<br /><br />Oh some more I thought of:<br /><br /><a href="http://4x86.com/mm9-5.nsf" class="postlink">mega man 9.5</a> - fitting 15 minutes of music in a 32K file in PPMCK using improvised techniques to do quantization, repeat macros, and strict bankswitching (this is not technically a "special effect" but just a way to do other effects efficiently)<br /><br /><a href="http://nsf.4x86.com/nsfs/Alkali_Earth.nsf" class="postlink">alkali earth</a> - layered saw waves for that eurotrash unce feel<br /><br /><a href="http://nsf.4x86.com/nsfs/Hawkeye.nsf" class="postlink">Hawkeye</a> - my actual first use of DPCM bass, but it's a lot less impressive than Sing for Absolution's use of it<br /><br /><a href="http://nsf.4x86.com/nsfs/Turbo.nsf" class="postlink">turbo</a> - took the idea that people have been doing forever with the triangle wave + noise to do a good snare and tweaked it to sound as realistic as i could<br /><br /><a href="http://nsf.4x86.com/nsfs/Our_Revolution.nsf" class="postlink">our revolution</a> - I wrote a program called Auto Echo that ..automated single channel echo (before this, for songs of mine such as "cruzzazzay," which had single channel echo for the entire song, it took hours just to make notes echo if there were a lot of them).  this is more of a milestone than anything because it made writing music 20x easier.  Right at 1:12 you can tell that it was clearly easier to do these because the song starts doing echo and never stops past this point <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />there's another song I don't have here, but sent to a friend.  I might be able to upload that later today-- it uses the FDS as the "noise" channel and uses the noise channel as bass.<br /><br />there are other things like "that first time i used single channel echo correctly" or other crazy effects, but those I mostly noticed in other songs and copied them.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=34">RushJet1</a> — Fri Aug 13, 2010 6:59 am</p><hr />
