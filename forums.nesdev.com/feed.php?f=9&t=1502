My devcart appears (to me) to be indexing some wrong tiles every few frames. No more than 5 or 6 tiles are doing this at a time on screen, sometimes none are (depending on the game) and it appears to be only happening to sprites. I believe the tiles which do this are consistant at every reset. I am using SRAM so it's not an EPROM-related issue, I also don't think there is a latency issue. All I can think of is a dry address line but I don't think this is the case since when I pause games, sometimes the tile is stable even if it's the wrong one. Any ideas?<br /><br />I've tried to make out which tiles are being replaced by which but it's not very easy to make out tiles on a TV. Here are some examples:<br /><br /><img src="http://img470.imageshack.us/img470/3006/14se.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://img82.imageshack.us/img82/381/27lq.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://img82.imageshack.us/img82/7882/p10100361dt.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/7553/p10100371wt.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />Edit: Aha! tile $45 becomes $C5, $55 becomes $D5 etc, this is an A13 issue... Wonder why this doesn't happen on the BG table and why it only happens on some sprites and only on some frames.<br /><br />Edit #2: Ehrm, this appears to be a issue with the Famicom, I switched to a 1984 console and it's working fine... maybe the PPUs have different timings.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> â€” Sat May 13, 2006 12:40 pm</p><hr />
