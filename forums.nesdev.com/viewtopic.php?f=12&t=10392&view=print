		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello everyone.<br /><br />I've been doing a bit of research and I've gathered a bit of information. The first thing I did was attempted to understand how the MAD-1 works.<br /><br />Please correct me if I'm wrong. If I get the okay, I'll go ahead and purchase the necessary chips.<br /><br /><br /><br />First of all, Shin Megami uses the <a href="http://www.snescentral.com/pcbboards.php?chip=SHVC-2A3M-10" class="postlink">SHVC-2A3M-10</a> board.<br /><br />I'm using the ACTUAL Japanese cartridge. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/tCiOyeu.jpg" class="postlink">Here</a> is a snapshot of it. Note that I mislabeled the MAD-1 chip.<br /><br />So, since the game itself is 2.50MiB (2,621,440 bytes, 0x280000) each ROM chip is at least 2MiB (16Mbit).<br /><br />So the first 0x200000 bytes are in P0 (ROM #1) and the remaining 0x80000 are in P1 (ROM #2).<br /><br /><br /><br />TL;DR: I need two Am29F032B with the TSOP adapter (I haven't looked into which one I need since the Am29F032B has 40 pins).<br /><br /><br /><br />Is there anything else that I'm missing?

If the translation is 2.5MB, it will be too large for the PCB without some rewiring.  However, 2.5MB is small enough to fit on a single AM29F032B, you don't need two of them.  The easiest way to go would be to get ahold of a 1A3M donor.

I didn't even consider the fact that the translation had increased the original size.<br /><br />So then if I get a hold of Fifa '96, then all that is required is ONE AM29F032B with no special rewiring?<br /><br /><br />Why did I make it so complicated? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />

You can get them from BUYICNOW.com, basically you solder the am29f03b onto it, and it correctly adapts the wiring to the correct pins for the SNES board. They cost about 70 cents, so not a big investment. You will want to look on youtube for videos on how to solder the am29f03b's onto it, as it appears a bit tricky, though isn't too hard.

The main purpose of the forums here is for technical help and discussion and development, and &quot;generally&quot; not for the sale of items -- though the sale of items is permitted/perfectly okay, the general opinion of the community is that folks don't want the forum to become an advertising-centric place.  The board under which such things would be sold varies depending on their purpose; use &quot;Search&quot; up top to search for things relevant and see what you find.
