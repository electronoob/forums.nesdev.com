Every game has its own format, it is up to programmer to decide how the data will be stored, so there is no ready made solution.</div><br /><br />Just saw this, and tried out NES screen tool. It's awesome. I'm using it right now.

Like, name them part8080 where 8080 is XY coords in a large map, you press something+Left, and the program will save current nametable and load part7f80 file. Didn't implement it yet, but if someone need this, I can add such a feature.

Also it has to have something to do with time and/ or steampunk (as in gears and factories and all that). also, this is serious names, so no &quot;Time to work at the factory!! LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL!!!&quot; No. Just, no.<br /><br /><br />Thanks.<br />-Amini<br /><br />EDIT: How about the Name Force of Time? or, Force of the Generations?
