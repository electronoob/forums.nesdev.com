If your entry includes source code, and your build process uses a batch file or shell script (as opposed to a makefile), or it includes executables that convert data or create lookup tables (as opposed to source code or a converter written in a scripting language), filters might block it as a potential malware vector.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks again to everyone for the submissions. I believe we have 6 Entries in Category 1, and 4 Entries in category 2. As well as a few in category 3.  I think everyone could have benefited from extending the contest another month, but I'm going to take this as a lesson learned. I'll have the voting ready either tonight or tomorrow so if you submitted an entry be sure to check your email. The website will also get updated with screenshots and downloads like the 2011 page.  Open voting on the category 2 entries will start on the 7th and run for 3 weeks.<br /><br />Any questions, let me know.

I can make a game select menu inside my own ROM, but it could be a bit tedious for player to have two game menus...<br /><br />Maybe iI still could have 3 entries in action53, every entry would point to my ROM. I examined Action53 ROM and I see it does not clear RAM after game selection, selected game do it. I can use the game selected number from RAM before my routine clears it to determine which of my games was choosen.<br /><br />How plausible this idea is?<br /><br />Aaannd...how much there is (approximately) to submit a game in 3rd category?

That's how Axe, MineShaft, Zapper Calibration, and ZapPing in the first multicart work: they're all part of one CNROM image, and the menu software chooses an initial value for the program counter based on the chosen activity. Other sets of things bundled into one 32K bank include Concentration Room/NES15/Russian Roulette, Lawn Mower/Thwaite, LAN Master/Munchie Attack, and Slappin'/FHBG.
