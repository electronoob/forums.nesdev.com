The D-Pad or Select button should be able to move the cursor around the options menu, but they behave quite unresponsively.  I did not notice this effect in other emulators.<br /><br />Any ideas on what's special about this particular screen in this particular game regarding input?

In fact, Nintaco also has the same issue; it works with PAL, but not NTSC.

Since the total polling routine takes about 30 scanlines you have about a 10% change of this happening on hardware. But in NEStaco there seems to be about a 100% chance, since trace logger indicates that a 'frame' starts at scanline -1 but at that point 1 of the 3 controller polls has already taken place.<br /><br />It's actually more of a mystery how it ever accepts any input, since this seems like it should fail every time.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br /><br />Also when I was using trace logger, sometimes the trace would start at random scanlines, I'm not sure why.<br /><br />EDIT: I should be clear that I am referring to what is happening in NESTaco.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think I finally understand what might be going on. Mesen polls the keyboard/gamepads every time it needs to update the NES controllers' state.  There is no particular point in the frame where this occurs - however, since the frame is executed in a fraction of the time it takes on a real NES (e.g 2-3ms instead of 16ms), the odds of the input changing during the frame is pretty low.  If the game expects the input to change between 2 points in the same frame, it's very unlikely that it would (the keypress would need to occur within that window).  Odds are you are pressing the controller while the emulation thread is sleeping (between both frames) - this is probably why playing the game with no speed limit fixes the issue.

Of course, this is all assuming that my assumption is correct in the first place.</div><br /><br />There's probably a simple solution that will take care of Spot and Quattro Sports.  The Spot options menu works in FCEUX and FCEUX is well-known for it's FM2 movie format.  FM2 is a recording of input that is sampled only once per frame.  Meaning, FCEUX is getting away with keeping the controller input values constants throughout entire frames.  The likely difference, as mentioned earlier in this thread, is the point that the cached inputs are updated within the frame cycle.  If only 2 known games are affected, then that seems like a reasonable engineering solution, even though it's not a perfect one.<br /><br />Also, when I get a chance, I'll study the exact code to better understand how these games are doing their polling.
