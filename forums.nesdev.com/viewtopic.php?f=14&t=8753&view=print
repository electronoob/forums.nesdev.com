<br />nesdev.com points to 72.20.98.77
<br /><!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nesdev.com">www.nesdev.com</a><!-- w --> points to 72.20.98.77
<br />nesdev.com points to 72.20.98.77
<br />wiki.nesdev.com points to 72.20.98.75
<br />
<br />nesdev.com will always point directly to the main nesdev site (never the Wiki).  Ever.  Period.
<br />
<br />nesdev.com permanently redirects any URL to <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/">http://nesdev.com/</a><!-- m -->, so a visit to <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/">http://nesdev.com/bbs/</a><!-- m --> will redirect you to <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/">http://nesdev.com/bbs/</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />The Wiki portion of nesdev is <strong>on a completely separate IP address</strong>.  If you were to connect to 72.20.98.77 and issue a GET request and a Host: header of wiki.nesdev.com, you will get a very informative error page that tells you "you're doing something naughty" and give you details about what it is your web browser submit to our server.
<br />
<br />I'll see if I can figure out what happened based on your IP address and the time frame you submit GET requests to our server, but overall this does not look to be a problem with any part of our infrastructure.

<br />
<br />The requests also landed at and were answered by the 72.20.98.77 IP address.
<br />
<br />Based on the fact that you posted the problem at 09:09 PDT, I would say the issue was with your ISP, some kind of man-in-the-middle compromise, or a very serious/catastrophic router bug.  I do not believe the problem was DNS-related (barring things like severely broken DNS caching proxies) because as I said, the wiki and main nesdev sites are on two completely different IP addresses.
<br />
<br />If I had to take a guess, I'd say your ISP (Access Communications in Canada) either uses a form of transparent HTTP caching/proxying or does some form of transparent layer 7 packet manipulation and their shit broke badly for a couple hours.  Whether or not you saw anomalies to other websites during that ~2 hour timeframe is irrelevant.  I have seen caching proxies (transparent or configurable) completely break before, and in very bad ways.  ISPs here in the states, like Comcast, have <a href="http://comcastisfuckingwithyourport53traffic.wordpress.com/2009/06/09/no-really/" class="postlink">screwed things up similarly</a> and despite customers noticing the problem the issue disappears mysteriously a few hours later with no mention of it anywhere.
<br />
<br />TL;DR -- whatever happened was purely unrelated to anything hosted here.

<br />
<br />The weirdest part was that nesdev.com went to the wiki and nesdev.com/bbs didn't go anywhere. I don't have much faith in my isp either, but for the price I pay it's the fastest I can get around here.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Understood.  I have no way to determine if it was a Safari problem or not, but I would strongly doubt it.  The fact that the Wiki and main nesdev site (which includes the BBS) are on different IPs indicates more than likely something very erroneous was going on upstream for you, or on a packet level.  If I had to take a wild guess, I'd say a very, very badly broken DNS server or some kind of transparent HTTP proxy/cache.
<br />
<br />Like I said, we didn't see any HTTP requests from your IP for over 2 hours, yet there were lots of other people visiting both sites (wiki and the nesdev sites) during that time frame.  I'm forced to believe the issue was somehow centric to you or your ISP, sad to say.  :(

It does things like examine whether or not there's transparent caching going on within your ISP, and similar issues with DNS.  The results may not make much sense to you, but they will to me.
