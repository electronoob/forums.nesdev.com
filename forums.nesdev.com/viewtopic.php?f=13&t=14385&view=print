I worry that Google is demoting our site for not being mobile-friendly. (I explained &quot;mobile-friendly&quot; in <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=173199#p173199" class="postlink">another post</a>.)<br /><br /><a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/" class="postlink">The front page of the BBS</a> is <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.nesdev.com%2F" class="postlink">NOT mobile-friendly</a>. It uses a table for layout, and I don't see how I'd make a CSS rule to make the table readable in a 320-pixel-wide window. If a responsive site (such as one whose CSS switches between layouts at certain thresholds of device width) is not achievable, a separate mobile-friendly theme may need to be applied somehow. While researching this, I discovered that themes are completely different between phpBB 3.0.x and 3.1.

Some 9-inch and larger tablets, such as the ASUS Transformer TF101 and Google Pixel C, even come with a clip-on keyboard. Though I've had no significant problem actually using NESdev.com with either Android tablet I've owned (ASUS Nexus 7 and Samsung Galaxy Tab A), Google still uses the mobile ranking for searches from Android tablets.

It's not competing against other &quot;mobile&quot; sites. To matter, it would have to be weighed against some mobile site with otherwise equivalent relevance.<br /><br />You're advocating for spam you received that was meant to target business advertisers. The demotion concept is simply not relevant to this site at present.<br /><br />(Again, not opposed to having a mobile option for the site if you're interested in implementing it, as long as it works, but it really ain't baroque.)

As someone relatively new to NES dev (I've only been at it about seven months), I rarely post, but I'm constantly perusing the forums for new information. It would be convenient and useful to be able to do so on my phone, but the completely non-optimized UI makes the process pretty painful at the moment.<br /><br />I don't know which version of phpBB the forums uses, but it looks like <a href="https://www.artodia.com/demo.php?demo=phpbb30&amp;id=7" class="postlink">Artodia</a> has some free &amp; nice-looking free responsive themes for both phpBB 3.0 and phpBB 3.1.

The site is perfectly usable and it's not like we're some shady site that tries to exploit Google rankings as much as possible to gain visibility. We have enough NES specific content  for people to find us, and that's what shady SEO dudes wish they had.

It works just fine for reading and for writing short replies, but longer posts are sometimes troublesome to write. I normally use an external editor (DroidEdit) when I need better editing capabilities, which's almost always when writing code or using many phpbb tags.
