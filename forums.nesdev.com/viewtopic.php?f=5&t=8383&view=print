		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A "macro" (assembly language) or an "inline function" (C) is a short piece of code that is substituted literally instead of being called as a subroutine.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">In <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=87207#87207" class="postlink">this post</a>, adam_smasher wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I've always found the value of macros to be overstated.</div>
<br />One advantage of macros in assembly language is that they allow the programmer intent of <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Synthetic_instructions" class="postlink">a few extremely common instruction sequences</a> to be made explicit. MIPS has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture#Pseudo_instructions" class="postlink">quite a few of them</a> and even reserves one register for use by the assembler to expand macros. Likewise in 6502: <ul><li>ADD is clearer than CLC ADC, and SUB is clearer than SEC SBC. </li><li>RSB (reverse subtract, as seen on ARM) is clearer than EOR #$FF SEC ADC, and RSC (reverse subtract with carry) is clearer than EOR #$FF ADC. </li><li>ASR (arithmetic shift right) is clearer than CMP #$80 ROR. </li></ul>
<br />An advantage in C is that it allows certain optimizations, such as peephole, common subexpression elimination and elimination of unused results, to be applied between the inline function's body and that of the function calling it.
<br />
<br />Other advantages and disadvantages of macros are similar to those of loop unrolling. Macros mean less time spent jumping around. The 6502, for example, has a 12-cycle subroutine call penalty, and in C, pushing a load of arguments to the stack can likewise cause slowdowns. Thus, macros can be a win if the body of the macro isn't much bigger than the code to get in and out of a subroutine. But misused macros can indeed make the code larger, and on architectures with cache and good branch prediction, this can slow the program down more than the jumping penalty if several inclusions of the macro's body make the inner loop not fit into cache.

<br />
<br />If I'm writing a function that I'm not sure will work as quickly or as well as I'd like, I divide it into macros. Then I can be sure parts of it work, and use the macros for those parts when I rethink my logic. It also makes it easier to test two versions of the same function at once.
<br />
<br />Admittedly, this only saves some copy paste time but it makes me <em>much</em> less frustrated when I have to optimize my method for the task at hand.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In assembler, I see three primary uses for macros - MIPS-style pseudo-instructions or other small snippets of code; certain low-level speed-vs-size optimizations, such as loop unrolling or procedure inling; and to substitute for subroutines for reasons other than speed.
<br />
<br />More precisely, when I said that the value of macros are overstated, what I mean is:
<br />
<br />In the case of pseudo-instructions, the eye quickly adjusts to common idioms like "CLC; ADC". Anyone with any experience coding the 6502/65816 will immediately understand the intention of such code. For people without any experience on these chips, hiding the workings of the processor does them no good.
<br />
<br />Ultimately I think hyper-clarifying common idioms and small-scale code like that is unnecessary. Most of the time the difficulty in understanding code isn't in figuring out the meaning of very local, mechanical behaviour (adding, pushing arguments onto the stack, etc.), but in understanding the meaning of tricky algorithms or complex systems of interlocking parts - which requires more than a few cheap macros to document.
<br />
<br />(contrariwise, when I wrote <a href="https://github.com/adamsmasher/ema" class="postlink">a MIPS assembler</a>, I did indeed implement some basic macro functionality - partly because my programming language/assembler design made it very easy to, but more significantly because trying to code in MIPS without pseudo-instructions would drive a person nuts, its instruction set is so impoverished)
<br />
<br />In the case of pseudo-subroutines, these in almost all cases do more harm than good and constitute abuse.
<br />
<br />In the case of optimization (loop unrolling, procedure inlining, code generation), there is a case for them. But a part of me still says that, when speed is so critical that you're willing to sacrifice small and clean code for it, extreme care and understanding of the trade-offs are needed - and rather than pretend like that's not the case, one should put all the ugliness out on display in full, so that the trade-offs being made are fully evident.
<br />
<br />Kasumi's approach is interesting, but I think (?) fairly uncommon. I'd also argue that, unless the code is performance critical, the ability to logically divide of code into discrete chunks like that is precisely what calls for subroutines.
<br />
<br />So there's a case for macros, but it's not huge - probably not as large as the tendency to abuse them. As I said in the other thread, I personally never use them and get by just fine, and I don't think of myself as a particularly exceptional asm coder.

If using copy &amp; paste, it really sucks to update all the routines separately if changes need to be made later.
<br />
<br />Also, many things, such as 16-bit arithmetic on 6502, don't suffer any kind of penalties when done with macros, as the code produced by the macros is/can be exactly the same as what would be done manually. They simply make the code easier to read and maintain.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There are ways to compromise between the speed advantage of a macro and the size advantage of a subroutine. Say you have a macro that has a common short path and that usually branches across an uncommon longer path. You can put the short path in a macro and the long path in a subroutine.
<br />
<br />The data decompression code that's used in a few of my unreleased projects has a macro to pull one bit from a stream. The code to pull one bit from a 1-byte temporary buffer is short, and the code to load another byte into that buffer is longer. So I put the code to pull one bit into a macro, which calls a subroutine to get the next byte if needed. So in 7 of 8 cases, I save 12 cycles on a JSR/RTS.
<br />
<br />The 8-bit binary to decimal conversion routine in Concentration Room and Thwaite is unrolled with the help of a macro:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.macro bcd8bit_iter value<br />&nbsp; .local skip<br />&nbsp; cmp value<br />&nbsp; bcc skip<br />&nbsp; sbc value<br />skip:<br />&nbsp; rol highDigits<br />.endmacro<br /><br />.proc bcd8bit<br />highDigits = 0<br />&nbsp; pha<br />&nbsp; lda #0<br />&nbsp; sta 0<br />&nbsp; pla<br /><br />&nbsp; bcd8bit_iter #200<br />&nbsp; bcd8bit_iter #100<br />&nbsp; bcd8bit_iter #80<br />&nbsp; bcd8bit_iter #40<br />&nbsp; bcd8bit_iter #20<br />&nbsp; bcd8bit_iter #10<br />&nbsp; rts<br />.endproc<br /></div>
<br />To do this without a macro while retaining the same clarity, I'd have to use a lookup table and the X register.

<br />Case in point: macros are not "necessary" for DMA on either the SNES or the GB - they only make DMA work very slightly tidier. And while they can certainly be useful for generating simple LUTs (again, not strictly necessary), I personally prefer banging out a quick C/Python/whatever script and INCBIN'ing it than worrying about learning some assembler's obtuse, non-portable, ad-hoc, limited, and often buggy macro language.
<br />
<br />Which reminds me - another case against macros is that they're deeply non-portable. Most pure asm code can easily be translated between assemblers without too much trouble; different assemblers, on the other hand, have wildly different macro languages and conversion between them is often non-trivial.

<br />
<br />If I understand this, You said ''Macros cannot be converted to another format'' It is Partially True,
<br />
<br />But if you convert Macros to certain 65xxx assemblers or such (I.e. WLA-DX to CA65), You can convert easily as long as you know how they work!
<br />
<br />They're convertable, but not by tools, just by hand!

Like some have already said, unrolling repetitive tasks is a great use for macros. I also use them for interfacing with mappers, where small series of register writes are necessary to accomplish tasks.
<br />
<br />I have also used macros to define subroutines that I wanted to place in the same file but needed to be distant from each other in the ROM. That would probably be classified as macro abuse though, because I'm sure some assemblers have better solutions for this.
