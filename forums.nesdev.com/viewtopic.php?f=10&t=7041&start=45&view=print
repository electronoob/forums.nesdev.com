<br />Yes, that's how it's connected on MMC1. For the picture of the solder side of the board, that would make the left square positive, and I'm guessing the right two negative (use a meter to be sure). Once you've got the holder soldered in, examine the battery and be sure the + really will go to the diode. You don't want a Li battery explosion. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Ok so i connect the + on the left square but... how about the other two? Do i have to connect the battery to both? Just one? And which?:D omg:/
<br />I have a digital meter but i'm not just new to reprocarts, i'm new to electronics <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />Blargg can you explain me what do i have to misure? I feel i really need a precise instruction...:/ Don't worry, take your time i'm not in a hurry <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />
<br />If thats the case, solder one in (Holder), add the parts the instructions say, add a RAM, put in the battery, play, test, then either be like "AWESOME! It works." or "It doesn't save!!! :/"

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Use the meter's continuity mode. This tells when the probes are connected. This allows you to find out what's connected to what on the circuit. Visual inspection is not a reliable method, especially when checking that you've soldered something. The idea is to verify that the circuit is connected a certain way. It's the equivalent of testing a program after you've written it, to be sure it really does what you think it will do. Spend some time using the continuity mode to verify things on the circuit, so you get good at using it. Be sure not to fall for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias#Biased_search_for_information" class="postlink">confirmation bias</a>, where you merely verify something you soldered is connected; also be sure it's <em>not</em> also shorted to nearby traces.

<br />I made a cart with zelda outlands and it works but does not save <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />I tried to connect the battery in <strong>every</strong> way using the 3 squares.
<br />now the + is on the nearest to the diode, the - on the center.
<br />I was doing misures: There's a little hole near the mapper (the chip pre-installed) which seems to receive power from the battery. if i touch it and i touch the first pin of the ram i can see 1.5V on the digital meter.
<br />This is all i can tell because i really don't know what to do now.
<br />plese, help :/
