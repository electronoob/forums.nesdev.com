<br />
<br />I know this have been discussed a couple of times now, but I'm having real hard time including NSF files in my code.
<br />
<br />I'm using NESASM, and from what I've read, that might be the problem, even thou I don't get errors  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> 
<br />Even if I copy some/most of the code posted here, I still can't get it to work.
<br />I have stripped the header from the NSF (Made with FamiTracker),and the load address is $B05D, I believe.
<br />The init address is $B200, and play is $B203.
<br />
<br />I've done everything I can possibly imagine, but no matter if I'm trying to include it at an existing project, or new one, I just can't get it to work.
<br />
<br />Any suggestions?

Have you had it generate a listing and looked at it?  Also what's it do, if you can step into it with a debugger?
<br />
<br />Best bet might be to reassemble the NSF and have it start at $8000.

<br />
<br />But I might have failed when it comes to getting those addresses?
<br />Load address is at 08-09 with a hex editor, init is 0A-0B, and play is 0C-0D?
<br />
<br />The NSF does play fine in NESten's NSF player, however.(With header, ofcourse.)
<br />
<br />I've seen a couple of ways to include NSF songs, and I don't know what to use, and concentrate on using yet. So perhaps I'm just doing all wrong there?
<br />What way is the most common/easiest?

<br />stop: jmp stop
<br />
<br />Then in a debugger, usually FCEU you can hit the step button, then you can step through it from there.
<br />
<br />Usually the NSF is assembled separately (with whatever assembler), though you could include the driver source (it usually wouldn't matter).
<br />
<br />It's most common to put the music starting at $8000, and you'll have to place any DPCM samples separately (at $C000 or above).

The driver source includes everything you'll need.  You can change the addresses in there pretty easily (linker config, the nes.cfg or nsf.cfg file).  I also recently made a modification for it so it can play music from multiple .dat files, if you ever need to.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In my older games, I used Famitracker NSFs, although I'd discourage it for anything other than just to get some music in there.
<br />
<br />Anyway, the NSF load address will change whenever you add something new to it.  In my old Geminim game, I had this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">NSFloadAddr = $A682 &nbsp; &nbsp;;Gets $80 subtracted from it when used down below<br />NSFinitAddr = $B200<br />NSFplayAddr = $B203<br /><br />....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.bank 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.org NSFloadAddr - $80<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.incbin &quot;Geminim.nsf&quot;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />The only reason I do that - $80 is because I was lazy and didn't bother stripping out the NSF header.  If you did do that, then disregard the -$80.
<br />
<br />Then, whenever a new sound needed to be loaded, I'd have some checks to see if a new sound was called and eventually would:  JSR NSFinitAddr
<br />
<br />...And every single frame there would be a JSR NSFplayAddr called towards the end of NMI.
<br />
<br />You also need to be sure the first $18 or so bytes of zero page are NOT used by anything and that most, if not all of $0200-$02FF is NOT used by anything.

<br />Except for the size of the driver which I now is easily 3/4k, why do you discourage it? Too much CPU usage? Hard to modify? I think it could be relevant to this thread.
<br />
<br />I was able to modify like Membler so I can locate  my music data where I want, disable some channels and play some sound fx (not perfect for fx, I stopped to work on that part to focus on other tools).

<br />
<br />I guess hard to modify to allow for sound effects would be my main complaint.  But that's just me.  The engine I have needs no modification by me, so I'm fine with it.

<br />
<br />ok, I see.  The way I'm doing it at the moment is that I inserted 2 variables: 1 for the music data address so you can point to your music anywhere in the rom and one for which channels I want to disable.
<br />
<br />Before I play the music in my frame (ft_music_play) I check if I need to do any sound fx. If any, I set in my variable which channel must be disabled.  In the music routine (apu module),  when the player decide to play the next frame, I check if the channel is disabled or not. If it is, I don't play the music on that channel.  Then, after the music routine is over, I play my sound fx. This way, the music player and soundfx player don't have to know about each other.
<br />
<br />Once I start to use it more seriously in my game I will see how easy is it to use that way or not.  If it's doesn't work so well, worst case I'll just make my own but I still think that we could do something interesting if we modify it properly. 
<br />
<br />I could try someday to to play another track as sound fx but I guess this one could be quite complicated to do depending how "flexible" you want it to be.

<br />Regarding your issue, are you making your own music or using an already existing NSF?  If by any chance you are making your music and doing it with Famitracker 2.7, I converted the sound driver for Nesasm.  I made a sample on how to use it too.

<br />This is the last update I did before I put that project on hold.  There is a sample for CA65 and nesasm.  It play some music and some simple sound fx. The sound fx part is not designed properly: it just for testing purpose and didn't have time to make an engine for it. You need to use FT2.7 to use it, not the latest one.
<br />
<br />I will port the new driver later once I get back on the music part of my game project since I want to use VRC6 at some point.  This file is already useful for nesasm users since the FT website only provide a CA65 version.
<br />
<br />I will do my best to provide some answers on the usage of the samples if any question arise.
