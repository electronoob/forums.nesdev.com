Coinheaven said he was looking into it, I've tried a few. I can copy someone else's eprom wiring and be fine, however I'll have to do some reading to get the actual process down.<br /><br />Thanks<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5377">wyndcrosser</a> — Sat Aug 11, 2012 10:07 am</p><hr />

My suggestion would be to leave the PRG memory as the original.  I would attempt to figure out the wiring using the CHR memory only.  Since they are both 256KB with same pin count presumably the pinout matches between the two (even though it doesn't for most Nintedo mask ROMs).  That way the game won't freeze, it'll just have bad graphics.  depending on how you wire up the ROM you could make it easy to quickly test dozens of wiring combinations.  Kind of a brute force method but it may work.<br /><br />The other &quot;work smarter not harder&quot; means is to take the original ROM and dump them via a EEPROM burner/reader.  Just assume the standard pinout and compare the binary dumped files against a known good ROM.  The patterns you'll find will allow you to figure out what pins are miswired.  It's easier said than done especially if you've never trouble shot such things, but really the best way to do it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Sat Aug 04, 2012 11:21 am</p><hr />
