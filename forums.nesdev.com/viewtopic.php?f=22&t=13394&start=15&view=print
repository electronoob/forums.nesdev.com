		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Coming along well. I see some eye size issues I need to fix. (See how much of the sclera is visible in one eye vs. the other)<br /><br />Thoughts about palettes: I would have added a second layer of shadow for the rest of the image, had I done it in full color. I just did the shading on the hat during sketching because I felt it was necessary to define the shape. I know we don't have palettes for more colors, but do you guys think the shadow layers in the other colors should be represented through dithering? The tongue color could probably be a decent shadow color for the skin if that's possible.<br /><br />I think it's going to be inevitable that some colors will have to be removed, right? How can we address this? Perhaps if we use the darker skin tone as one of the main colors for his clothes, and for the other article, we may have to use the color from his hat. Does anyone see any other options? Recycling colors seems to be the only choice.

Lowering this jawline helps to define a character as a child or female.<br /><br />Your way may be a bit less typical for anime but everybody has their own styles. I think if we made a bit of an indention for the eye socket, and then curve out to the cheek and down to the jaw like you have it, would be a pretty good middle-ground.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">the face is hardly shaded at all, save for that one side</div><br /><br />Palette limitations reduced the amount of shading I wanted to have. There should be a shadow dropped under his chin, and the shading on the right side of his face (left side of the picture) had to be simplified to fit into palette boundaries. Nor was I able to shade under his eyebrows as I wanted. <br /><br />Even just the little bit of shading on the head to me makes the body and arms look flat by comparison. The shading on the head isn't ideal but it still adds a little bit of volume.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">In my opinion, what needs to be shaded are inner corners, such as between each arm and the torso, following the principle of ambient occlusion.

Tonight I plan to make a compromise between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygomatic_bone" class="postlink">cheek bone</a> shapes in the most recent versions by darryl.revok and Espozo, so I can push out 0.03 with code for displaying the portrait. That'll at least give me a chance to see how many tiles I'm dealing with, so we know how much space there is for shading on the body. Any ideas for the 32x32 enemy sprite or the scrolling background?

Because there's no black+background+vest+mitten palette, I had to move the mitten to the left by about 6 pixels to get it and the vest to touch at the corner of a 16x16 area. I ended up with 213 tiles and thus a trivial display routine.

Both have English dubs, but I definitely recommend the originals.
