		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I decided to update my Powerpak mappers from 1.32 (plus the loopy mappers) to 1.34 and have encountered a problem with playing NSFs or games with extra sound channels.  Some games play the extra audio, while none of my NSFs will.  Everything worked fine before updating.
<br />
<br />Here's what I've done so far:
<br />* Reformatted (not quick format) Kingston 1GB flash card
<br />    -Tried FAT
<br />    -Tried FAT32
<br />* Downloaded 1.34 mappers from Retrozone and extracted to the card
<br />* Checked roms and made sure they were good.
<br />* Tried on my modded NES and Famicom (with modded adapter)
<br />
<br />
<br />Games that work with extra sound since I updated:
<br />- Akumajou Densetsu (J)
<br />- King of Kings (J) (bad graphics, but just testing audio)
<br />- Final Lap (J)
<br />- Erika to Satoru no Yume Bouken (J)
<br />
<br />
<br />Games that don't work properly sound wise:
<br />- Mappy Kids (J)
<br />- Sangokushi 2 - Haou no Tairiku (J)
<br />
<br />
<br />NSFs I tested and don't work right since updating:
<br />- Castlevania 3 - Dracula's Curse JP (VRC6)(1989)(Konami)
<br />- Moryo Senki Madara (VRC6)(1990)(Konami)
<br />- Gleylancer1 (N106)
<br />- T_AkumajoDracula_VampireKiller_N106ver
<br />
<br />I'm about to try going back to an older version of the mappers, but before I do I wanted to see if anyone had any suggestions.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />

<br />
<br />I tried replacing M.Map and NSF.NES from a 1.33 release and a 1.20 release I had on my drive and nothing bring the extra sound back for the NSFs.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  I even tried reformatting again and going back to my 1.20 release and it's still gone.  Oh well, there's always PC-based NSF emulation I guess!

<br />
<br />Joe1088, does your NSF player play N106-enabled NSF files?

<br />
<br />Yes it does; all implemented expanded audio works now. The M.MAP I have is dated 11/29/2008. Checking Loopy's site, I see he has one dated 11/30/2008. Try <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~olimar/NES/" class="postlink">here</a> for the latest.
<br />
<br />I did check and it was M.MAP that was the issue in my case.
<br />
<br />Edit: Possibly also NSF.NES, like you mentioned. Try his latest version of that too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hmmm I have had this issue too. I wonder why bunnyboy doesn't include loopys mappers in to the official release?
<br />
<br />Hmm wait he did:
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">NES Mappers v1.30<br />-------------<br />  - Added many mappers written by loopy</div>
<br />
<br />But somehow these perhaps have been replaced in the official release?
<br />
<br />Another issue I have had, while recording from my own nsf's using PP to play them. Is that in the beginning of the songs the sound gets a bit bad. This is solved by making a special "recording version of the nsf". I add a pattern of silence in FT and problem is solved. I guess this issue can be solved in the NSF-playing software, by adding 0,5 sec of silence before starting to play.

<br />What's the official problem/fix?
