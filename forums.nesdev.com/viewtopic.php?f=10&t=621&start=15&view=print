I've redone the nesasm helloworld program by K-ZS, but I've used CHR RAM, and I think this would be useful on the main site, if people are to ask about CHR RAM again, they could be forwarded to that, what to you think? I think it will be newbie friendly, because I've commented on it and stuff. So tell me if you want it on the main site, and I'll send it to you.

<br />Because my example was loading $8000-$9FFF... so it'll stop at $A0xx.  Of course you'll have to adjust the code so that it works with your addresses and whatnot.

Hey, could you do a combo of incbining and data? like make a tile with code, and put it in a blank space in the chr file? is that possible? i would do it, so I could have constantly changing tiles, like the water tiles on ff2, I think they just lsr the whole time, right? they shift the graphics bits to the right, right?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, making such effect is a bit tricky.
<br />I think the best way to do it would be to store the actual tiles in RAM, then modify the RAM and upload it on VBlank if needed.
<br />Doing a such water thing would be :
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda #&gt;WaterTileNmr*$10<br />sta $2006<br />lda #&lt;WaterTileNmr*$10<br />ldx #WaterIndex<br />lda WaterBuffer,X<br />pha<br />asl A&nbsp; &nbsp;;Setup the carry in function of the bit 7 of water<br />pla<br />rol A&nbsp; ;All bits are rotated, and bit 7 becomes bit 0 &#40;8-bit rotation&#41;<br />sta WaterBuffer,X<br />sta $2007</div>
<br />
<br />But such code is exclsively for FF-style water... if you want to do anyother effect, you'll have to make a different algoritm, or simply load an alternate tile periodically. However, remember the VBlank limit while loading stuff in $2007. It allows VERY few tiles to be loaded in a single VBlank, in NTSC. (12 in the best case, see "Battletoad's writing to $2007 system" thread in NESDev section). PAL can load much more, however.

<br />But the rotating code is very short, and you'll need to do it only once per frame (if you do it like FF), so doing it in VBlank is okay... scince you have nothing else to upload. I'm pretty sure that FF2, FF3 and Hanjuku Hero does that in VBlank.

I <strong>still</strong> wouldn't recommend putting that code in VBlank... but rather I'd do it after all my time sensitive code (the stuff that HAS to be done in VBlank) is finished.  After all that crap is out of the way, the scroll values are reset, the screen is turned back on, and the thing is ready to draw a frame....  THEN do your water animation, joypad reading, and all the other stuff that needs to be done every frame -- but not necessarily in VBlank.
<br />
<br />You never know when you might have to add new things to VBlank..  even if you have time to spare now, you might not in the future.  It doesn't make sense to eat up precious VBlank time with something that doesn't need to be there.

I know for a fact that my code is fine, I don't have any stray sprites that have the value of tile #0 and coordinates for 0,0. I made sure by only having what sprite variables I'm using in RAM, and not random ones that I can use in the future. ?????
