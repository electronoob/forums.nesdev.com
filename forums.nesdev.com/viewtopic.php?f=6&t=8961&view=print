		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, I'm new around here.  I am really hoping someone can offer me some advice.  I have been trying to record NES music directly from my NES, using the AV jacks, into Audacity.  I know about NSFs, but I really want high-quality MP3s with unemulated sound.  My problem is that the audio jack of my NES buzzes like crazy no matter what I do.  I've tried moving it away from other power sources, disconnecting the video cable, running it through a MobilePre USB preamp &amp; audio interface, using different power supplies, etc.  Still can't get rid of the damn buzz.  I've looked at a few other posts relating to the same issue, but I know nothing about building audio circuits or modifying my NES, so they were a bit too technical for me.  I've also tried using the Audacity noise removal feature, which helps a little bit, but not enough.  Any comments or help would be appreciated.

You can minimize this by making the video signal as weak as possible. Have your music player turn the screen off and set the background color to $0D while recording.

<br />I just LOLed at this oxymoron.
<br />
<br />More seriously, the distortion caused by MP3 compression, even at 320kbps, will be way more significant than the errors due to the emulated nature of analog filters.
<br />
<br />I also can confirm what tepples says, the video polluting the audio signal is a real problem, I always get some 50Hz buzz if I put the sound loud enough on my consoles and I hate this - therefore I always make the sound quiet.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, using the RCA outputs of your NES does tap the audio signal at an earlier point; it would cut the whole RF modulation and demodulation process out of the circuit. It may indeed remove some noise. (If the question was using RF instead of RCA for just the video out; no there won't be a difference to the audio from the RCA out.) However, most of the unpleasant noises are already there by the time you get there, so it probably won't help much.
<br />
<br />Honestly, good NSF players are <em>very good</em> at emulating the NES sound without any of the noise or hum that comes with a real NES. I would recommend you take another look at that  way of doing it; you will get better quality sound.

I myself ran into very hideous sound by using a universal adapter...increasing the voltage from 9 to 12 improved the situation immensely, though I dunno if 12 is good for the NES' electronic chain.
<br />
<br />If you're gonna go to the trouble of recording an NES, I would suggest FLAC as a compressed audio format. Mp3 is fine only if you know what you're doing (i.e., the latest version of LAME is not the best version) and intend on keeping the original wav. Also, soundcard quality and recording level are immensely important...try to record at 24-bit if your system allows it.

<br />
<br />I had noticed this with the NES as well when it came to using the Powerpak. I switched it up and stopped using the retroplug for the NES and SNES and the humming stopped. I never had a problem with capturing music from the NES. 
<br />
<br />I would like to point out that the original nes power adapter is rated to output at AC9v 1.3A but on the nes itself the rating is AC9v 850mA.
