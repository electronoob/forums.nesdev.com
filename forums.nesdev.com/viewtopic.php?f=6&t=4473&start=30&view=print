<br />
<br />Anyway I've been starting work on Splash Woman's theme..however, the lead Square pulse wave after the intro is echoing as well as the bass line..At first I thought they cheated and are using 3 separate square wave channels, but then I noticed that the bass line only echos sometimes, as well as the lead only echoes the other time. This is going to be really tricky.
<br />
<br />Splash Woman's theme also seems to follow the same formula that Bubble Man's theme follows..only Bubble Man's theme is much more catchy.

<br />These unfortunately have such non-standard tempos that S3M2NSF pretty much butchers them. If you want to hear how they're intentionally supposed to sound, listen to the S3Ms
<br />
<br />I hope S3M2NSF fixes these kinds of bugs..maybe perhaps reformat the songs to be more NES standard. I tried playing around with tempos and and pattern speeds such..doesn't seem to help much. I dunno.
<br />
<br />I'm currently working on Wily Stage 3.
<br />
<br />These are the only songs I have left to complete on this entire soundtrack:
<br />hornet, magma, splash, tornado (I'm gonna redo this one), ending, staff roll.
<br />
<br />I'm almost done the whole thing. Holy crap.
<br />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wily Stage 4 and Stage Select vary slightly. I've been working on attempting to get it right since I started working on it, but it seems impossible without sacrificing the resolution of the pitch bends (this is an S3M format limitation).
<br />
<br />The two songs sound very similar, I agree. However my version of Stage Select is using a pattern tempo that's different from Wily Stage 4, so it would require a rewrite. I'll attempt a fix at it, though. Of course, it won't sound identical to the original song, again because of S3M pitch bend limitations.
<br />
<br />Do I want the bends to sound right? Or do I want them to cut at the right point in time?
<br />
<br />If S3M could play back patterns at 300bpm, a lot of my problems would be solved..but alas, 255 is the top-out maximum..at least, for Impulse Tracker.
<br />
<br />I'm using Schism Tracker to create these songs, however you could use ModPlug Tracker as well.
<br />
<br />EDIT: The re-write of stage select is done. I'll include it in the next archive I post.
<br />
<br />EDIT 2: Wily Stage 3 is done. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tssf.gamemusic.ca/temp/wilystg3.nsf">http://tssf.gamemusic.ca/temp/wilystg3.nsf</a><!-- m -->

<br />
<br />I'm remaking Tornado man's theme, and the same problem that was in Acmlm's version is in mine. Apparently at the note A-5 (which also seems to be the universal tuning frequency 440, right?) when a vibrato or fine pitch bend is used during this frequency range, the note actually "distorts".
<br />
<br />here are a couple examples: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tssf.gamemusic.ca/temp/tornado.nsf">http://tssf.gamemusic.ca/temp/tornado.nsf</a><!-- m -->

<br />
<br />Forgive my ignorance but is this a limitation of the NES sound chip, as it doesn't seem to be limited to one single sound system?

<br />
<br />What tempos are these?  Since the NSF format is 60hz or 50hz (pal), there are specific tempos that will work better than others.
<br />112.5,120,150,180,225,300 all sound "right" to a certain point.  <a href="http://2a03.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=314" class="postlink">Blargg posted some tempo info at 2a03 awhile ago</a> that covers this pretty nicely.  S3M2NSF may not handle these well, but they will always sound off to a certain degree.
<br />
<br />Your note on tornado man has bugged me too- in MCK, every A note pops when it is pitchbent over-- maybe this has something to do with how it address the notes or something.

<br />
<br />The Boss theme is 170bpm
<br />Concrete man is 168bpm
<br />Galaxy man is 165
<br />get Rush Jet/Weapon is 180bpm
<br />Second Intro is 195
<br />Third one is 145
<br />Stage Select and Wily Stage 4 is 143
<br />Suspense is 196
<br />Title theme is 185
<br />Tornado Man is 160
<br />Jewel Man is 180bpm, however it still messes up near the second part of the song with that high square wave'd effect going on. Hm.
<br />
<br />These tempos are rounded up/down from the tempos I was able to determain by putting the MP3's into Pro Tools and using its tempo tools to figure out the actual values and such.
<br />
<br />Ah well. Anyway, I figured out a work-around for Tornado man's A note problem..I use a vibrato, just not as deep as one.

<br />
<br />Yes, here's what I wrote this about it in NT2's docs:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The NES's hardware has a bug, or a design feature, or whatever you<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; would call it involving writing the high-byte of the frequency.&nbsp; What<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; happens, is that if a vibrato or a portamento affects the highest 3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bits of the frequency, the sound will snap, crackle, and pop.&nbsp; So<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; basically what you do to work around this is not use vibratos on some<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; notes, and remember that it will kinda pop if you do portamentos on<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; some notes.&nbsp; One game where this is noticable is Crash 'n the Boys by<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Technos.&nbsp; If you have the cartridge, listen to the .NSF first, then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; play the game on NES and hear the difference.&nbsp; Also, the title screen<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; music of Demon Sword uses this feature to a rather nice effect!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Damian Yerrick looked into the matter, and sent me this:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A-3 A-2 A-1 F-1 D-1 B-0 &lt;-- Those are approximately the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;notes where the NES switches the high byte.<br /><br /></div>
<br />
<br />What it's effectively doing is resetting the pulse-wave (imagine a one-off retrigger effect).
