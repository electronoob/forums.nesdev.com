<br />
<br />I guess the reason some people like tracker is maybe because they have experience with them since long time ago.  As for me, I was using Scream Tracker 3.2 under dos in 1994. Some people background may be on the amiga were trackers was very common if my memory is good.
<br />
<br />The reason I like a tracker is because it is easier for me to visualizes what I do since I don't know my notes but if I hear them I can do something out of it.  So with, for example, Famitracker, I can see my notes, tests it right away, replay just one part I want to fix.  
<br />
<br />My concern for now is how well can I integrate what Famitracker do in a Nes game...  That could be an issue.

<br />I guess this was what Celius was talking about, using other people's engines with your code. You could always shuffle the variables around to make sure they do not conflict with your own, but it still might be wasteful to use a generic sound driver when you could have a more optimized one with only the features you actually require, and read songs in whatever format is best for you to store.

In this case though, I don't think it means "Death Dragon", because "death" is "shi", not "shin", as far as I can remember. I think "shin" could mean "new" or "real", but don't take my word for it. It's been a while since I studied japanese, and it's not like I get a lot of chances to practice.</div>
<br />
<br />You are right.  Shinryu in FFV is 神竜, which you might translate as "Dragon God". 　I don't know about the anime you mentioned, but the kanji for purple 紫 does have a reading "shi"

Both those series are far more cartoony, have less animation, and less technical special effects.

The main hero of all Breath of Fire games, and the recurent guy in Street Fighter series, are all called that. The hero of Bahamut Lagoon is also called that. Some dragon in Final Fantasy 5 is called that. You really can't call that name uncommon I've seen it hundreds of times (altough it's possible all those times are from games released later than the original NG).</div>
<br />My point is except for Ninja Gaiden's Ryuu, it's a nickname (street fighter) or descriptor (final fantasy)/placeholder (breath of fire) and it's all coincidental. AFAIK, Ninja Gaiden is the only game with Ryuu as a given name, and in Ryuu's later appearances after Street Fighter (Dead or Alive, Ninja Gaiden XBOX) he goes by Hayabusa, his family name, which is more distinguishable. In Street Fighter, Ryuu's name is an alias/nickname, since he never gives his real name. In Final Fantasy, if a dragon is called "Ryu", that's because in the original Japanese game the dragon was called "dragon", and the translators didn't find that acceptable. In Breath of Fire, the main character is called Ryuu, because of the game's tradition of the main character being a nameless abandoned dragon... That's all there is to it, it's not like the name "sasuke" which is by far the most overused stock ninja name.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree with kyuusaku that CV and Megaman have much more cartoony graphics than NG. To me, the problem with NG is definitely NOT the backgrounds, but the sprites. Also, the animations aren't really a problem, it's just the fact that there is so little shading that makes it look so rather average. Even with the limited colors, they could have added shading to the main character to look better.
<br />
<br />And about the split, I think too that we should let it be. The only reason it was split from the other thread is because that was an informative topic; this one's really just a for-fun topic.

<br />My buddy and I talk about this alot actually! I think he was the first out of us two to find out that there was a Genny version of the game. I remember booting it up and just... jaw dropped... ugh! Seriously, it looks HORRIBLE on the Genesis, and if I remember right, the music is even bad.

<br />It's just so much better to Nintendoize that stuff ; )

<br />I guess this shows that good design in good graphics (and probably all visual art in general) is just as important - or even more important - than a wide palette.  For example, a professional black-and-white sketch looks better than a colorful kindergarten kid's drawing, even though the kindergarten drawing has more colors.  The SNES and Genesis versions obviously have a wider color depth, but the NES version has overall much better design.  The Genesis version in particular has IMO horrendous coloring and character design - Batman looks too fat and goofy in comparison to the NES version.

<br />
<br />I see your point but at the beginning, if your goal is to program a game and not a sound engine, it may be more efficient for you that already made sound engine because of the time I will save to make the music and to integrate it.  If I write everything by hand, it will take more time to manage.  
<br />
<br />Code reuse is usually good. Maybe in this case, that may not always be because of optimization for a specific game. Maybe we should find a way to transform the Famitracker data format (by format I mean engine of course) to our own data format?
<br />
<br />By the way, I still want to know where your avatar comes from. Is it from your current game?

<br />Did you ask about my avatar before? Sorry if I missed that! It uses some of the graphics of my game, but the it was not made from in-game shots. The engine has very few graphics, and it's going through a sort of rewrite now because things got so big I was starting to mess up.
<br />
<br />It's an original Sonic game for the NES, with new levels, story, etc, and I'll try to be as faithful to the Genesis games as possible, which means I plan for it to be better than the SMS games and clones like Somari and Jurassic Boy.

<br />
<br />This is what I meant. In some situation,the time you save is worth the extra complexity/extra cpu cycles of using that engine.
<br />
<br />A split? Nahh.  Technically I'm the cause of the original split because I was off topic and now people are having fun talking about all kind of subject. I'm quite happy with this thread, don't worry too much about it.

<br />
<br />I don't think (personally) the reason they gave Hayabusa as is name is to make it more distinguishable.  Usually in japan, you always call people by their familly name, never from their first name. The only rare case is when you're very very close with that person.  
<br />
<br />At work, even thought I'm still very friendly with some of my coworker, I always call them by their family name.  My personal guess is this is more the formal way to call him from a Japanese point of view.
