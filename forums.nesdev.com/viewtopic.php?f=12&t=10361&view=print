		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />MAD-1 and MAD-2 are simply address decoders with a built it voltage supervisor for managing the battery-backed SRAM.  Their purpose can easily be replaced by discrete logic (as shown with your Killer Instinct board, the 74LS00 is just 4 NAND gates).  Nintendo actually did this on official carts too, though they typically used the 74LS139, which is a dual 2-to-4 decoder.  If you were unsure, your carts are indeed clones.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What you're attempting to do is, I think at this point, beyond your skill level.  You don't just go out and &quot;buy random SNES carts&quot; and think &quot;hey I'm just gonna drop in a replacement game&quot;.  It takes a bit more work than that, and a hell of a lot more education/familiarity than what you're at right now (no offence).  For example:<br /><br />How did you plan on getting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_Tower_%281995_video_game%29" class="postlink">Clock Tower</a> (the game itself -- link is for those who aren't aware there's a game called Clock Tower) onto a chip, and what kind/type of chip?<br /><br />Usually the answer is &quot;an EPROM or EEPROM&quot;, neither of which uses the same pinout as what Nintendo uses for their DIP mask ROMs -- meaning in those cases board rewiring is needed (<a href="http://kogami02.free.fr/Divers/Gun_Hazard.JPG" class="postlink">example</a>).<br /><br />Next, how do you plan on getting that chip onto a PCB (cartridge/board)?<br /><br />Usually the answer to this is &quot;I'll solder it on&quot;.  To do that easily/cleanly you need a socketable board.<br /><br />Your Contra clone cart has no sockets for the ROM (only a socket for an address decoder chip -- what it's used for I can't tell, I don't do EE).  The &quot;black blobs&quot; you see on there are called &quot;blob top&quot; chips, they are literally just chips (in this case the ROM) dropped onto the PCB and held in place while epoxy is poured over the chip, &quot;gluing&quot; it to the PCB in the precise correct location so all the traces/connections line up.  99% of the time these are pirate carts.  This cart is basically worthless for what you need.<br /><br />Your Killer Instinct cart, on the other hand, has sockets -- but for what type of chip (EPROM, EEPROM, etc.) I can't tell immediately (someone else probably can).  One or more of the &quot;blob top&quot; chips on this cart is the game ROM; Killer Instinct, to my knowledge, doesn't use SRAM so I'm not sure what the 2nd blob is, other than maybe the other half of the ROM.  It does not have a MAD-1, but it does have some address decoders as qwertymodo said.  The MAD-1 is the least of your concerns, if you ask me, and that will soon become clear.<br /><br />What you should try to do is find out what an actual Clock Tower cart looks like.  Nintendo brands all of their carts with a model number (ex. SHVC-1A5B, etc.), and that scheme can actually disclose a lot about the overall cartridge wiring and so on.<br /><br />In fact, I found it -- here's Clock Tower:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.snescentral.com/article.php?id=0889">http://www.snescentral.com/article.php?id=0889</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.snescentral.com/pcbboards.php?chip=SHVC-BJ1M-20">http://www.snescentral.com/pcbboards.ph ... VC-BJ1M-20</a><!-- m --><br /><br />You can clearly see here that the Clock Tower cart uses an SHVC-BJ1M-20, has two DIP mask ROMs, a MAD-1 (address decoder), a D411A (CIC security chip), a LH5216AD (16KB of SRAM), and a battery (powers the SRAM).  What you need is a cart that has all of this, although you could rewire the cart to use only one mask ROM (might need another address decoder (not sure, again not an EE guy)), and the D411A can probably be bypassed.<br /><br />What you <strong>currently</strong> have is worthless if you want to make the task easy on yourself.<br /><br />I would suggest sticking with emulators -- it's a lot easier, way less stressful, and so on.
