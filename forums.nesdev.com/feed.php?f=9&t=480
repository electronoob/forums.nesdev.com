A lot of people would like a card with 128 KB of PRG RAM, 8 KB of CHR RAM, a few KB of ROM to bootstrap the thing, and an UNROM-style mapper (with bit 3 selecting ROM or RAM in the upper 16 KB). Connect a cable from the PC's parallel or serial port to the NES's controller port, and you have multiboot just like on the GBA.<br /><br />Or you could get an FDS RAM card and an FDS Loader cable, which has much the same idea as what I presented.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Aug 10, 2005 5:16 pm</p><hr />

If you look around these boards, you might find that there are already projects that are similar to this idea.<br /><br />Look around this board and see why it isn't as simple as the GBA flash carts... (besides demand)<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Tue Aug 09, 2005 12:15 pm</p><hr />

Hi,<br /><br />First, greetings to you all since I am new to the board...<br /><br />I got this idea some hours ago that no doubt many people have had before, yet I could not find any projects on google for it. I don't know much about neither electronics nor programming, but out of interest and a dream of this project to once become true by if not my own hand then by some other peoples hands, I'll spit it out.<br /><br />It would be so cool if you could somehow connect a cable to the connectors of a cartridge, so data would go from the cable to the NES and not through some chips on the cartridge board, and then hook that cable to a computer somehow, i guess through a serial or parallell (or usb or whatever) port, and then have a way to talk to the nes through the computer. <br /><br />Next thing would be to code an interface and program that could "load" a game rom that the NES can pull when it is powered on.<br /><br />I know it's an insane project both in complexity and timeconsuming....<br /><br />I mainly want to know what people who have a grasp of electronics and how the NES works, and programmers also, think of the idea. Just want someone to start thinking about it. Seeing how the discussion goes, perhaps I will even dare to start tinkering around with it, without any hopes to actually get it working but just for fun.<br /><br />I am realistic enough to realize I personally likely could never pull it off heh. But it would be cool if someone did and I could build that thing and load roms from my pc someday.<br /><br />Here is a silly sketch of the idea: <img src="http://img208.imageshack.us/my.php?image=idea13bb.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />// J<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=178">jesperj</a> — Tue Aug 09, 2005 10:38 am</p><hr />
