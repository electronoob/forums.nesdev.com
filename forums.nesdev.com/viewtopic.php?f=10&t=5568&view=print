		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys, this is my first post here, so sorry if this was put in the wrong forum, or this already has a thread.  
<br />
<br />Anyway, I was wondering if this was possible.  I know that there's already a version on a physical cartridge, but it's not the complete version.  The only cartridge I've seen the complete version on is the JY Company 45-in-1.  I've also heard that Mapper 90 games are pretty finicky.  So, my question is this:  If I have a standalone ROM of the full version of SMW, could I write it to a cartridge?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From what I understand (I don't have any mapper 90 carts) they use a 'glob-top' package for those mappers, and in that case it almost always follows that the ROMs are glob-top also.  To quote the magic 8-ball, "outlook not good".  Even so, it's theoretically still possible, but it would be a lot of work (you could scape off the solder-mask and wire to some thin traces on the PCB - assuming all of them are exposed and not under the epoxy blob).

<br />
<br /> I've always wondered why SMW and\or Bio Miricle AKA Baby Mario have never been hacked to a more common mapper. They both seem to be games popular enough that someone would have took on the job.

<br />
<br />Mapper 90 is just plain rediculous. I've tried to port SMW, but it just strange in some situations.
<br />
<br />"Mario Baby" hasn't been hacked because the mapper used actually maps areas of WRAM space with PRG-ROM...It's a sinch to get emulated, but it's just plain difficult to port the code to the correct space. Same with Ai Senshi Nicol and SMB2J (Loopy ported SMB2J to MMC3 though).
<br />
<br />P.S.: On the other hand, all the MMC3-compatible games this Person/Group made in the pirate scene seem to work well on stock boards.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have hacked the cartridge version of Bio Miracle to MMC5. I also have looked into hacking some mapper 90 games like SMW and Final Fight 3. However, they are programmed so wonky, Final Fight 3 for instance is designed apparently with traps to discourage modification of the game causing crashes when you modify certain parts. I lost interest in trying to hack mapper 90 games when I ran up against that resistance as I have little interest putting alot of effort into hacking a really shitty game. Sorry, but SMW sucks, FF3 sucks, it's just a novelty and one I certainly can do without.
