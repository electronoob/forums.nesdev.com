Or anything not supported by powerpak. As for a prize...well quitte frankly I suggest having the compo first and then figuring out a possible prize. (altough I suppose just winning would be neat) Sure its not the best motivator out there, but come on if all you care about is a prize you shouldn't be entering a competition <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />These games in the end are going to be played, so thats why I think coding shouldn't matter as much if it gets the job done. I am sure we will all write some pretty good code, as many of use seem like decent programmers and wouldn't want stupid crap in our games that make us look dumb  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Relax, nobody is gonna judge anything by looking at code, that makes no sense. What's important is that the game isn't all glitchy (full of visible programming errors) and that it runs perfectly on hardware. If something doesn't run well on hardware I don't think it should even qualify.
<br />
<br />I don't agree with the "let's just get started and figure out the details later" philosophy. All coders have the right to know what they're getting into before they decide to take the journey. If you want this to succeed, it has to look professional.

<br />And maybe there could still be a multi cart, but if anyone uses 2 different mappers, that would screw us all up <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> Atleast if they are all NROM though, then we could stick them on a cart and switch between.... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I like the multicart idea (if the games aren't complete shit) so I'm fine with limiting to NROM only. I would think there's some market for a cart like that. The profits could be used in several ways, some of them could go in to the prize pool for the next compo (so we could make this a recurring thing without donated money) and some maybe to the authors of the games. Of course the cart manufacturer also takes a cut.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The reason I was suggesting the size limitation was so there was an even playing ground. Everyone here seems to agree that 32k is plenty big enough for a game, so why don't we just use that? Otherwise, I'm worried that the "competition" will just degrade into "who has the most complex game?" 
<br />
<br />Besides, if you're worried about not having space to fit all of your supergiant levels, just look at SMB. There'd be the extra challenge in getting all of your data to fit within the size constraint, and having a huge game within 32k would be a lot more impressive then having a huge game within 1mb, wouldn't you agree?

<br />Agreed.
<br />
<br />I wonder what's the consensus on this matter.
<br />
<br />Let's say I wanted to use my existing platformer engine and build a new game on top of it... while still extending the engine's functionality, effectively working on my main project AND the compo at the same time.
<br />(That way I could probably convince myself to participate in the compo <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> )
<br />
<br />It does feel a little unfair to me, since so much work has gone into this engine already. Then again, why write anything from scratch if you've got reusable code?
