Since the new versions of FCEUX don't even work with the original un-translated ROM I had, I decided that I would make a new version that will work in all emulators and in the real hardware.  If you start with either version of the ROM, it will convert it to the new version.<br /><br />Of course, now the $c56c table is located somewhere else as it wouldn't fit there.  Here's what I did.<br /><br />I had a 7 byte table that would now not be used and I needed to find a place for a 15 byte table.  I found two 7 byte tables back to back.   The first one could be expanded 1 more byte in front as the previous 2 bytes were both RTS instructions.  I put the new 15 byte table there.  I moved one of the 7 byte tables to $c56c.  Finally, I'm pretty sure a 7 byte piece of code that simply inverts $91.0 does not get used.  $91 is a flag for the text row vs. the dakuten row.  But it is simply assigned 0 or 1 so it doesn't need to be toggled.<br /><br />Problem now is that I need someone to play through the whole game with the new version on the real thing and I really don't have the ability or desire to do that myself.  Anyone interested in beta testing Rev B of Heracles on real NES hardware?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4724">DvD</a> — Tue Sep 02, 2014 6:39 pm</p><hr />

Yup, that's what was wrong: the UNROM bus-conflict avoidance table exists from $C56C through $C573 and consists of 0,1,2,3,4,5,6; as appropriate for the original 128KiB game. When they expanded the game to 256KiB, they didn't expand that table to include 7 through 14.

No i dont, but its the only translation that I could find for it. Got it from romhacking.net . So you think it could be a problem with the patch itself? How could I test for that?<br /><br />And, if it was a problem with the patch, wouldnt it glitch out on the Powerpak as well?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5783">getafixx</a> — Thu Jan 10, 2013 12:54 pm</p><hr />

Actually, I have a better idea. Do you know that the translation you're trying actually avoids bus conflicts correctly?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Thu Jan 10, 2013 12:47 pm</p><hr />
