Three tips:<br /><br />First, when saving pixel art to be posted to a forum, use PNG format instead of JPEG. PNG is designed for pictures with large flat areas. JPEG is designed for gradients, and it can add noise to edges of flat areas.<br /><br />Second, when blowing up pixel art to be posted to a forum, resize it to an even multiple multiple of 100%. Preferably resize it by a multiple of ten (e.g. 1000%) or four (e.g. 400%, 800%, or 1600%). You resized your graphic to 1489% or something oddball like that. For <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Overscan" class="postlink">various obscure reasons related to the exact clock speed of the PPU</a>, the most authentic resize is 800% by 700%.<br /><br />Third, if you're willing to make your character just a bit smaller, you can stagger the sprite grid to fit odd shapes like the brim of the hat.<br /><br /><img src="http://pineight.com/mw/images/3/36/Noir_Guy_Sprite_5a.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="http://pineight.com/mw/images/4/4c/Noir_Guy_Sprite_5b.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Left: Unoptimized graphic, requiring eight sprites to cover it.<br />Right: Shrunk just a tad so that I can completely cover it with six sprites.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Dec 14, 2011 5:10 pm</p><hr />

Thanks for the compliments guys, really appreciate that <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Yeah, the background would be transparent, so black, white and grey are my 3 colours.<br /><br />I think i'm getting the way in which they can be constructed. If he's within the rules, I'll probably develop it a bit, do a little sprite sheet for him to get the feel of things, and then maybe move onto a different style of drawing, try out a few things and see what works the best.<br /><br />And thanks thefox, that's a good idea. I'll post up a smaller one alongside him next time<br /><br />Thanks again!<br /><br />EDIT - thanks for that advice on pixels/colour too 3gengames. Yeah that makes sense. I'll probably go along this route for a bit, and then perhaps making a version with slightly heavier 2px outlines.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5021">Sendo</a> — Wed Dec 14, 2011 12:22 pm</p><hr />

Since you can build sprites with either 8x8 or 8x16 (Pick one) and have up to 64, and at most can have 8 of those building-block "sprites" per scanline, so yeah that seems good to me. You've used up all your colors with from what I can tell. The white on the eye/glove would be a whole palette color, along with the grey and black. I take it the white around him would be transparent. But I think it's a great little sprite. Blows mine out of the water for sure. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> One thing that may be a problem is that pixels that are  1 pixel wide sometimes can't really be seen easily, so you may want to try to try making everything 2 pixels wide. Although 1-pixel wide colorings can also be used as a tool to get more synthetic colors. Look at Tepples games LJ65 after you place some blocks. On emulator it just looks like separate dots but on a CRT it'd look like different colors. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Wed Dec 14, 2011 12:15 pm</p><hr />

You can always keep a palette open and use 8x16 sprites and cover up what needs to be behind objects by stealing those background tiles when needed. Unless you use 2 palettes you couldn't have two objects that you go behind both next to each other.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Tue Dec 13, 2011 10:47 pm</p><hr />

Yeah. That unreleased dizzy game lets you walk behind trees that way.<br /><br />It's cool in a platformer when the solid color is the sky, but I'm not personally a huge fan of the single solid color floor required for it in a top down game. That's part of what makes Solstice so special. It actually changes the character's pixels that are behind the background in CHR to transparent, so more than one color can be used for those walls.<br /><br />I should stop being so personal in this thread, though. I suppose a lot of things I say I don't want to do can be done, and sometimes can be done pretty easily.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Tue Dec 13, 2011 9:43 pm</p><hr />

You can create backgrounds that are a solid color and put the sprites behind objects that use all 3 colors though. Check out Crystalis, it does it. Just to get an idea of what needs to happen to have that too for putting sprites behind stuff.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Tue Dec 13, 2011 9:33 pm</p><hr />

This is great and <em>seriously</em> helpful, thankyou!<br /><br />I definitely wouldn't want to try and break rules like this, so all good.<br /><br />What i do like the idea of doing is creating an atmospheric background that a cool looking sprite can explore; couple that with an atmospheric soundtrack and that's where the vibe will come from i hope...<br /><br />You've really given me some great possibilities for ideas man, and those ideas all reside in the realm of simplicity. <br /><br />One thing i'm really not bothered about is jumping.

I'm going to do some serious work on some graphics and post up what i've got ASAP. <br /><br />I guess i hope that if i can create a really harmonious aesthetic, colour and style-wise coupled with some great audio, then i'd be doing a good job as an artist and composer...i'd then be looking at a programmer to facilitate the interaction of these elements effectively.

Here's an image (From a GBA game, but whatever): <br /><img src="http://img221.imageshack.us/img221/1883/bothh.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The NES basically has two layers. There is a background layer (top left), and a sprite layer (top right). On NES, sprites are drawn on top of the background except in very special cases. You can see them together on the bottom. (I also moved mario and luigi to a higher spot so you could see that the map actually has height and depth.)<br /><br />These layers are like sheets of glass, or animation cels. I paint a background on one (top left). Then I paint Mario and luigi on one. (top right).<br /><br />Then I put the cel with the bros on top of the one with the background. There is no way I can have... say a part of Mario's body disappear behind the tree because Mario's body is always drawn whole, and the cel with his body is always placed on top of the cell with the tree.<br /><br />This is why you can't walk behind a building in Final Fantasy: <br /><img src="http://img835.imageshack.us/img835/4293/59567705.png" alt="Image" /><br />If you walked one square down, the hero would appear on the roof of the building, instead of behind it as expected! So they just don't let you walk there.<br /><br />Here's another example of what can't happen:<br /><img src="http://img338.imageshack.us/img338/7320/badk.png" alt="Image" /><br />Top left: Mario is next to a building.<br />Top Right: Mario has jumped to the right on the building ceiling.<br />Bottom left: Mario has walked north passed the edge of the ceiling. He falls and is partially behind it.<br />Bottom Right: What Mario would like on NES in the exact same spot.<br /><br />The problem isn't specific to isometric graphics exactly. But "square" graphics give a little more freedom. With square graphics, you have three possible locations to fall from a square high place. (You can walk south and fall in front of it, east and fall to the right of it, and west and fall to the left of it.) Only two sides of an isometric square high place are safe to fall from.<br /><br />Another issue with isometric, is that NES limits the colors by square portions of the background layer, so laying out isometric maps that use a lot of color is difficult. <br /><br />In any case, if you only wanted to do top down walking and not top down walking and jumping to higher places, none of these things really matter.<br /><br />But saying all that is probably worth no more than saying isometric is harder to do. Or to keep the map flat if you want jumping like Gremlins 2 does. One day I will learn to write posts instead of books.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Tue Dec 13, 2011 9:18 pm</p><hr />

Haha, that definitely doesn't make sense to me! You have to remember man, i can barely handle HTML etc, i'm a good artist and musician, but in no way a programmer!

Not to go too much off topic, but this forum is really welcoming and it's very refreshing.<br /><br />What i can certainly appreciate (and already had an inkling about) is that something like isometric would definitely be a headache to implement. The thing i like about The Immortal in this case isn't so much the visual style (as great as it looks), it's simply the flow. <br /><br />In the case of a hurdle like that, in working with a programmer, i would simply say, cool - lets go with what works (which i'm guessing would be top down or side on?) This is really the way i want to approach things - choosing the best fit for the job.<br /><br />An interesting homebrew game i came across that does seem to combine the kind of flow i mean (Although i'm not necessarily into the shooting/jumping vibe) is Neotoxin: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYy_J8cfcw4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYy_J8cfcw4</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Good story state, alternating with some kind of action state.<br /><br />So yeah, i like the idea of working out a flow that would help drive an abstract narrative. What that flow is exactly depends on what's possible with you guys, and also what you think i could work with graphically, bearing in mind my abilities. I love all old games and classic genres so i really am <em>very</em> open on this. It's all about what works best and can be implemented most effectively!<br /><br />If you can, i would love to see the corresponding pictures to that code if you would be up for posting? I'm really down with learning as much as i can so i can start to understand the side of the equation you guys are coming from. Thank you again for all your help.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5021">Sendo</a> — Tue Dec 13, 2011 8:13 pm</p><hr />

That sort of thing would probably be doable, but your mention of Immortal reminds me of one other thing one probably shouldn't ask for with: Games where you can go behind the background. <br /><br />Isometric games (The graphical style used by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E20jk5vgkdQ" class="postlink">Solstice</a> or Immortal) are generally out because of this. I actually used to think Solstice was MAGIC because it can do this. I figured out how it's done, and it really is cool. But difficult. Check out 0:39 of that video, and if you look closely you can see the character go behind the background a few times in the following few rooms. <br /><br />Imagine a situation like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">+=Walkable Ground<br />*=Higher Walkable ground<br />|=Wall<br />0 = impassable ground<br />********<br />********<br />****0000<br />****0000<br />****0000<br />||||0000<br />++++0000<br />++++0000<br /></div><br />That is fine, because even though the player can go higher, there's never a situation where he could both be standing on a lower part of the map AND have part of his body behind a higher part of the map.<br /><br />This however is bad:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">+++++<br />****+<br />****+<br />||||+<br />+++++<br /></div><br /><br />Let's see a character here:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&amp;&amp;= Character<br />&amp;&amp;<br /><br />+&amp;&amp;++<br />****+<br />****+<br />||||+<br />+++++<br /></div><br /><br />What he's doing is standing behind the high wall, (that's why there are only two &amp; symbols) which is difficult to do on NES.<br /><br />If that doesn't make sense, I'll make actual pictures.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Tue Dec 13, 2011 7:59 pm</p><hr />
