The voltage/current rating of 9V/500mA means it's supposed to output at least 9V when 500mA are drawn.  If it's unregulated, it may be 13V or something if it's passing less current.<br /><br />And also, the front-loading NES connects the unregulated power to it's expansion port, so it made sense for the NES to have some extra power available.  You wouldn't need an extra AC adapter for the Famicom Disk Drive (nor a battery compartment like the FDS had).<br /><br />I've been designing a board (haven't worked on it lately) that includes a switching power supply powered by the NES expansion port, and I've expected the input voltage to be in the range of 7V-20V.  When using a 12V power supply I think it may be as high 20V.</div>

Looks like adaptor have transformer for 100V grid, so you have 10V instead of 8V. Best way to sort this problem is... use noname universal adaptor and setup 7.5-8V <strong>before</strong> regulator, when NES is <strong>on</strong>. 10V is too much. Or another way is install bigger heatsink.</div>
<br />
<br />
<br />Be cautious if you do something like this.  You'll be hard pressed to find universal adaptors providing AC power the NES requires.  I really don't think your 9.5-10volts is a problem.  I don't understand why there is still so much fixation on it.  Nintendo didn't make different 100 or 120 volt supply versions of AC adapters.  I'm pretty sure your not the only one with 120vac main power.   Its also safe to say nothing broke with your adapter Since it would have had to sprout a few more windings to give you increased voltage.
<br />
<br />Nor is a bigger heat sink a real solution.  It would be more like a bad band aid.  
<br />
<br />So is the new regulator still overheating like the old one?

<br />
<br />Yeah there is no real fault that could occur with the adapter to cause this issue or your indications which is what I was trying to say earlier.  But at least you've proven that now.
<br />
<br />It is possible that if your capacitor is leaking (shorted out) to the point it's drawing so much current that the regulator is then becoming overloaded.  I'm not sure how likely that is to occur though.  Usually failed caps have visible damage either bulged or leaking fluid though. 
<br />
<br />Why do you have to unsolder the whole power supply to remove the cover???  Unless something is different with your NES, I'm able to just remove the BOTTOM cover of the power supply with my fingers.  Then I have easy access to the two solder pads for the large cap.  It would be super easy to desolder and remove it, check it, and replace if needed without having to desolder anything besides the cap's two connectons.  Just make SURE you keep the negative terminal of the cap pointed towards the regulator, or atleast that's how it's aligned in my NES.

There must be a common component of failure in these power supplies, since I have the same problem on two NES circuit boards. They both have the new regulator installed. One is my original from the 80's that only I owned and took good care of, the other is one off of eBay sold as broken that my friend used the case to make an NES pc.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you had some component drawing enough current to cause the regulator to overheat to the point you can't touch it, then that component itself should be hot to the touch especially compared to other components.
<br />
<br />It's practically impossible to troubleshoot effectively by measuring currents in series on a circuit like the NES.  Voltage measurements are your only viable option for in circuit trouble shooting.  
<br />
<br />Have you gone through and thoroughly checked everything visually?  Looking for any corrosion, dirt, discoloration etc.  That's one of your best tell tales, the other being heat sensing as you've worked with a bit already but wouldn't hurt to do a few more times looking for things you missed the first time.
<br />
<br />If it's something that's a fairly common issue like you're saying I would have to suspect the giant power cap you've been considering.  It's really the most likely component on the whole board to go bad.  I think it's also possible that if it were to fail, the regualtor would be over worked and cause it to overheat.  Without actually causing the cap to overheat itself contrary to what I suggested above.  This is all just speculation though as I don't have a schematic to reference.
