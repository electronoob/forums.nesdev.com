I, however, got &quot;put in my place&quot; so to speak by the results of the contest and how the game was received. So, I gutted out quite a bit of code to completely redo it and saw no use keeping the old seeing that at that time to me it was worthless. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" />

(There are tools like rsync that could do this more effectively, but it was more about what was available already / easy to me at the time.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks. <br /><br />I absolutely love the bat sprite in this game. It has so much charm and it's rare to see someone approach such a common trope (bat as minor enemy) in such a unique way. In fact, I included the claw game on the cover art solely to feature that very specific bat.

I'm glad at least something of this game could be called interesting.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I thought it was great that you could take the (cool looking) bats by surprise by stabbing or running by when you came from the left, but have to face them when you're backtracing for treasures and trinkets. <br /><br />In a larger game, they might've had different configurations and mirrored looks to match for different directions of attention, but it worked perfectly in your design.  <img src="./images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" />
