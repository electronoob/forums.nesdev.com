I guess I'm having a hard time understanding why this is even necessary.  Why do the roms that some people have work fine, while others like myself are having nothing but problems?  As I said in a previous post, all of my roms were downloaded at least 5 years ago, and according to the file, created as long as 10 years ago.  A quick search online seems to indicate that most of the roms floating around are also that old.  I've tried downloading different versions of the the same games (for instance, Super Mario Bros by itself, +Duck Hunt, or +Duck Hunt and Track&amp;Field.) and the exact same thing happens to Mario.  Again this isn't just on Mario games, this is on EVERY game.
<br />
<br />I realize that this forum is meant for NES developers with the background to go with it, but this product wasn't only marketed to that crowd.  If there is nothing wrong with my PowerPak, then I need to know either how to fix the roms I have, or where I can find "good" ones.  I'm sorry to sound like a whiner, but I feel like I've paid a good amount of money to be a beta tester.  I'm sure this will be resolved, but I just needed to blow off some steam. 
<br />
<br />Thanks

<br />the outher current option is manually editing them useing a hex editor witch is slow going when doing a lot
<br />
<br />but if its every game maybe there are outher problems causeing the trouble like card format parhaps or the powerpack files are not all loaded in?

<br />personally I am quite impressed with its abiltys and injoys it quite a bit the  mapper I paticlarley miss is mapper 19 but 64 differint ones is still plenty for now

<br />Even stranger. For me, Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! (U) (PRG1) [!].nes works almost flawlessly on my front-loader (minor opponent tile corruption during fight), but has constant graphics corruption on my top-loader. Very confused.

<br />
<br />how do you use goodnes?  i opened the exe file and got the command.  then i opened a command line and typed fixnes when i was in the folder where the .exe file is.  i know this is probably wrong, just wondering how to use it.

But it appears that a header "signature" that starts with H, I, J, K, X, Y, or Z will falsely trigger NES 2.0 mode.</div>Kevtris chose the signature pattern for NES 2.0 after doing a ROM scan to see what bit patterns exist in the wild.  He didn't find any with D2 clear and D3 set in byte 7, so he chose that configuration for NES 2.0.  This doesn't mean ROMs won't exist that can be falsely detected as NES 2.0, but hopefully such incidents will be fairly rare.
<br />
<br />To help avoid false positives, you could also read byte 9 of the header, which in NES 2.0 contains additional bits for PRG and CHR sizes.  If this byte is non-zero, and if the resulting PRG/CHR sizes are too large when compared with the actual file size, you can conclude that the ROM is probably not NES 2.0.

<br />
<br />that is just a database of ROMs you have already scaned it is not nessasery and is generated after you run a scan
<br />its just to help you keep track of ROM's you already have to make it easyer to collect them all
