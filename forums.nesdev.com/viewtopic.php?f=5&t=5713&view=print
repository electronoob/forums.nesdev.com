		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Right now the main page of the nesdev website has been frozen in time for quite some time. Wouldn't be great if people could contribute to it?
<br />
<br />My idea is, why not just move that page inside the wiki and use the wiki to edit the content of it?  You put a redirect of the main page to one of the wiki page and then anybody that have time can contribute to modify the layout.
<br />
<br />I think this could be a simple but interesting idea.  What do you think Membler (and other people of the community)? Would it make sense? That way, anybody could help you to modify the main page of nesdev through the wiki edit software like a CMS (content management system for web page).
<br />
<br />Alternatively, the main page could have it's own wiki and style. There is still another wiki installed that I didn't use yet.

<br />Few days ago, I was wondering how to update some links of the main page. With the wiki, the operation would be easier and faster.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've wanted to set up something like that for a while, but haven't been sure how to.  From what I've seen so far, with the Wiki it seems like for users to upload files it's a big hassle.  It seems that even uploading text files has all kinds of security issues.  Sure it could be put in a ZIP file, or as a wiki page, but those to me seem like annoying little barriers to access a straight text file.
<br />
<br />I've kinda thought about opening up an incoming directory on an anonymous ftp server, but that seems decidedly oldschool (what's next, 00index and file_id.diz files? heh).
<br />
<br />Really I'd like something like what exists at <a href="http://2a03.free.fr/" class="postlink">http://2a03.free.fr/</a>.  But all the available CMS systems I've looked at look to be overly complex.
<br />
<br />But yeah, a Wiki page seems to be closest to what I'd like to see.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As for uploading files, I would say don't let the user do it from the wiki.  There is no approval of account  so anybody and their dog can create one and could upload if the right is given by default. And we don't know how the files are saved so I don't like that either for archival purpose. For pictures, I don't mind much but for files I do.
<br />
<br />Right now, the original page has been frozen for too long and there is no easy way for anybody to try to help you to update it so this is a problem. What I would suggest is I will try to do a sample page inside the wiki once I find time.  The goal is to put back the original content of the page by section but wikified.  This mean all links to files will be external links. I think this would make it more like a normal web page except you don't need to edit some HTML to edit the links, just the content which is a good thing.  Where almost in 2010 so we should stop worrying about html tags and let the CMS do it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Once you approve the page we can put a redirect at the root folder to go to that specific page in the wiki. 
<br />
<br />Regarding upload, maybe some people lurking on nesdev have some idea of a system where you can upload then approve the file?   Once the file is approved, you just put an external link inside the main page of the wiki, like when you edited the normal html webpage. Sometime some format like pure text is still better in its original form than wikified. 
<br />
<br />If we don't find a system then we can go oldschool with an anonymous ftp and a restricted folder. The only issue with that system is who will take the time to approve the file, move it to the real files folder and put it in the wiki.

<br />
<br />Just for that, it's already better than modifying an HTML page don't you agree? The goal of this thread is to find a solution for the main page. If you have ideas then feel free to contributes them to this thread.

<br />
<br />Someone named Cheesemeister is helping to make that sample page. He continued were I left of yesterday night and at the speed he's going, he will finish to convert the links soon. I'm happy to see people wanting to help for that cause.
<br />
<br />Once the links are converted, we can think later how to improve the layout (put by section like wiki, re-organize etc).  Now that it will be in the wiki, anybody can help.
<br />
<br />The page is still raw but what do you think about it Memblers?
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />I just finished converting the page available <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Nesdev" class="postlink">here</a>.
<br />
<br />Cheesemeister verified some of the link he converted. I didn't have the time to do so.  I already modified the sidebar in the wiki to show the link to the nesdev page and wiki one. 
<br />
<br />Now I need people comment about it. I think it would do the job.  Now we just need Memblers's blessing <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />What will be left to figure out is how to upload files to nesdev but I'm sure we can figure something out.
<br />
<br />Some of the images can be converted to look more like the wiki colors, like I did for the Wiki logo but I think there is no rush for that part since now anybody can help.
