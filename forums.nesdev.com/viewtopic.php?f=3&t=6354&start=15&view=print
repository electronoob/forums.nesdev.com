		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was objecting to the cryptic nature of your replies, as confirmed by Petruza thinking you were answering his question. Often a person makes a comment, someone else asks what he's talking about, and the person points to something and says "that" as a shorthand for "that is what I was talking about". This new slang tepples linked to of "this/that" also having a dramatic meaning of "I agree with this/that" is cryptic to me, and difficult to even look up for its meaning unless one knows it happens to be in the Urban Dictionary (because one simply expects to find the definition of the word "this", not an explanation of an idiom using it). Tepples is the first who has ever pointed me to a description of it.
<br />
<br />I'm still not making much sense of your first reply either, about it being annoying. What's annoying? What's the big risk you think Petruza is trying to avoid? Were you saying that you can't be sure the CPU really works without having a PPU? I agree regarding I/O mapping, because a CPU test can't be sure all the specific I/O addresses are wired to the proper chips. I disagree about testing the CPU itself; a CPU test can be much more thorough than a game, <em>and</em> give a clear pointer to which instruction(s) are at fault.
<br />
<br />Basically, I get frustrated when people make cryptic replies. I guess it's like in school where they wanted you to write complete sentence answers, so it's really clear what the reply is. Maybe it's just me. Sorry.

<br />
<br />If I assume a CPU test will only pass a CPU that handles correctly every 6502 instruction, sets the flags correctly, the results are right, the memory is read and written with the correct values and in the correct addresses, and the cycle count is accurate, then when developing the APU &amp; PPU, I can concentrate on specific problems there, instead of wasting hours of debugging the PPU only to find out that STA $2000 was actually writing to $0020 instead.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There are two kinds of tests: quick <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing#Smoke_testing_in_software_development" class="postlink">smoke tests</a> to catch obvious errors and detailed tests to catch corner cases and timing errors. You can probably write your own smoke tests like this:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; lda #8<br />&nbsp; sta $300<br />&nbsp; lda #9<br />&nbsp; sta $301<br />&nbsp; lda #10<br />&nbsp; sta $302<br />&nbsp; ldx #0<br />&nbsp; lda #8<br />&nbsp; cmp $300,x<br />&nbsp; bne fail<br />&nbsp; inx<br />&nbsp; lda #9<br />&nbsp; cmp $300,x<br />&nbsp; bne fail<br />&nbsp; inx<br />&nbsp; lda #10<br />&nbsp; cmp $300,x<br />&nbsp; bne fail<br />&nbsp; lda #1<br />&nbsp; jmp nextTest<br />fail:<br />&nbsp; lda #0<br />nextTest:<br />&nbsp; sta $7F0<br /></div>
<br />But the CPU has no architectural way to measure its own timing, extra reads, or repeated writes to the same address. So some detailed tests will need a PPU or APU implementation because, for example, they might use PPU side effects to measure on what addresses the CPU executed side effects.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yesterday I finished a usable version of a disassembler inside my emu and caught such a stupid error as the branch instructions making the jump AND advancing the pc the lenght of the instruction ( 2 bytes )
<br />I guess I can make a simple ROM that performs some examples of every instruction and go step by step checking my disassembler to catch any other obvious errors like the previous one.
