		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been thinking a lot about doing some FPGA projects related to the NES.  I was wondering how much interest there was in the community.  What I ultimately want is something like the FunkFlashCart - a flash cart which supports many mappers.  Since FFC is pretty stagnant, and not open source, I've been thinking about making one.  However, I think it's best to start out with some "baby steps".  So what I'm suggesting is:
<br />
<br />1. Pick a development platform.  I know both Altera and Xilinx offer free tools for design and (I think) simulation of small projects.  There is also an open source toolchain, but I don't know much about it.  This should eliminate the need for someone to have a devboard in order to contribute.
<br />
<br />2. Pick a chip to simulate.  For example, maybe we start out with MMC1.
<br />
<br />3. Create a implementation of the chip.  I like the idea of creating the initial implementation using schematic capture, then developing a rigorous test suite to verify it, and finally writing a VHDL implementation.  Maybe schematic capture would be good enough though.
<br />
<br />4. Wire it up onto a MMC1 cart and watch it work.  This obviously requires a devboard, and probably a bunch of 3V to 5V conversion chips.
<br />
<br />Then we re-peat the process for another MMC chip.  Once we have a decent library of them, we can use it as the basis for a FunkyFlashCart-like board.
<br />
<br />What do you guys think - good idea or bad idea?  How many would be interested in helping?

<br />
<br />I personally favor Xilinx HW despite Quartus being far better for schematic entry thanks to their wonderful primitives library.
<br />
<br />FPGA is not feasible today without level translators which seems perverse to me for NES, maybe this project should consider CPLD like FunkyFlash. Since FPGA are volatile, I believe they're better suited to RAM based systems. I believe CPLD fit better with flash. It also keeps the parts and configuration complexity way down by using a CPLD. The only tradeoff is that you're limited to tight designs.
<br />
<br />One strike against Altera is that they don't have any 5V friendly CPLD anymore.
<br />
<br />I don't think you have to worry about actual mapper implementations, they're pretty trivial, I made a MMC1 discrete TTL implementation I could probably enter in Quartus in 20 minutes.
<br />
<br />Schematic capture is good enough IMO. I believe it could reach a far greater audience. I have little HDL experience and little intention of seriously learning one anytime soon,  gates are universal. 
<br />
<br />If people insist on HDL (and happen to use Altera tools), I suggest using Altera HDL which is far less abstract than VHDL or Verilog.

<br />
<br />I only know about it because I used gEDA for the last PCB I designed.  I think using Quartus or the Xilinx Web Pack is probably a better choice for now though.  I had been thinking FPGA because I had used them in school years ago, and because I have some "large" projects in mind for the future.  But you make some excellent points.  For this initial work we don't need the extra gates, and having a 5V compatible CPLD is fantastic.  From what I've can tell both Xilinx and Altera offer 5V CPLD's.  I've only used Quartus in the last 5 years, but I'm sure learning the Xilinx way of doing things can't be that bad.
<br />Honestly I don't have a preference for vendor, but I'd like to find a part that has a good combination of: price, capacity (#of gates), and package.  Obviously none of us are going to be able to do anything with Xilinx's largest 5V CPLD, the XC95288, because it only comes in HQ and BGA packages.
<br />My preference for VHDL comes from the fact that it's text based, and therefore more portable.  I don't like the idea of my design being locked in a proprietary format schematic file.  However, I'm much more comfortable right now with schematic capture, so I'd like to start out with that as you mentioned.
<br />kyuusaku, if you're willing to help out with an MMC schematic that would be fantastic.  I actually started on one using Quartus about 2 years ago, which I never finished.  Maybe I'll set up a Sourceforge or Google Code project so we can share some ideas?

<br />
<br />There are some large CPLD's which can probably handle MMC5, but they have two big problems:
<br />1. They are expensive.  The one I saw cost about $54, where the smaller one used by FunkyFlashCart can be found for around $15.
<br />2. They only come in very small packages.  This means it cannot be soldered by hand, and would require a professional board stuffer.
<br />
<br />However, it doesn't really matter.  The point of this project would be to allow for a single MMC at a time to be loaded into the CPLD.  With the exception of MMC5 that should allow us to design and verify all the "mappers".
<br />It really wouldn't be any different functionally from the FunkyFlashCart, but I'd like to make the project as transparent as possible so that if the main developers go on hiatus, it can be picked up by others.

<br />
<br />As far as the CPLD vs. FPGA thing, I'd just rather have whichever is more capable.  Maybe an FPGA board would be an ok dev board for prototyping a CPLD-based design?  I dunno.  I guess with CPLDs being more limited, the high-level stuff might not be optimal.
<br />
<br />I wouldn't mind a whole bunch of logic level translators on a design, if it's what we need.
<br />
<br />I've not done any programmable logic stuff.  I've got an Altera JTAG cable that's waiting to be used though.  Any platform would be fine for me though.  Altera, Xilinx, Lattice, whatever.  As long as it's accessible.

CPLD for configuration, SDcard, glue and FPGA for mappers would be appropriate. But using a FPGA with dozens of translators to emulate a 8bit data latch is overkill. FPGA bring a new level of complexity and price to the project.
<br />
<br />If the thing is PC operated and configured, I believe it should be a flash based system, with CPLD--fully nonvolatile. CPLD are not that incapable, I don't think it's possible for any CPLD to emulate MMC5 in all it's glory, but CPLD can surely emulate any other Famicom/NES mapper. 
<br />
<br />An idea: if the device had an optional 60pin connector, one could use "plugin" expansion audio carts to easily develop for that mapper, you'd just need a game with it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I like the idea's being suggested.  Membler's your offer to help with board layouts is very generous, I think you did a fantastic job with your flash cart.  It looks like we are all looking for approximately the same thing... a Universal NES Cartridge (UNESC).  Here is how I propose we get there, in three large stages:
<br />Stage 1 - Start making the building blocks.  This means getting solid, tested implementations of the components we are trying to re-implement.  This is what I had suggested previously, possibly starting with MMC1.  The goal here is just to build the pieces, not to produce a usable flash cartridge.  This can be done completely without custom hardware, a generic dev board should be fine.
<br />
<br />Stage 2 - The "Funky" stage.  We put the pieces developed previously together with some flash parts to create essentially a FunkyFlashCart clone.  It is implemented in a CPLD, and can emulate one mapper at a time.  It's relatively simple due to having native 5V IO, and we can keep the PRG and Data buses separate.  We can build working flash development carts at this point.  We can also work out the bugs in all our mapper implementations (except for maybe MMC5 based ones).
<br /><a href="http://img88.imageshack.us/my.php?image=stage1ts0.png" class="postlink">http://img88.imageshack.us/my.php?image=stage1ts0.png</a>
<br />
<br />Stage 3 - UNESC.  We move up to a FPGA.  It requires 40 or more channels of level shifting since we won't find an FPGA with 5V IO.  It gives us the ability to MUX the PRG and CHR busses together, and use a single SDRAM to hold everything (CHR, PRG, WRAM, VRAM).  The whole thing is controlled by a microcontroller, which also gives us a USB interface for communicating with the PC, and the ability to read/write to an SD card.  We can implement a system where a ROM is loaded from the SD card, along with the mapper config to load into the FPGA.  That way, it will support any mapper at any time without having to re-program.
<br /><a href="http://img225.imageshack.us/my.php?image=stage2pr6.png" class="postlink">http://img225.imageshack.us/my.php?image=stage2pr6.png</a>
<br />
<br />The above has generally been my plan, but it is extremely ambitious and I didn't want to go claiming that I was going to build it and then not follow through.  That is why I suggested stage 1 originally.  I really think that it will take several months to complete stage 1, another 6 months for stage 2, and another 6-12 months for stage 3. 
<br />
<br />When it's all said and done, two products will be available - a low cost single mapper at a time CPLD cart, and a more expensive but infinitely more capable FPGA based one.
<br />
<br />But before I get too far ahead of myself, I think we need to start slow.  Let's get the fundamental pieces designed and working in isolation, then we can worry about building a product.  I think having a goal like "make a working replacement for MMC1" is a much easier to attain than "make the worlds most advanced NES flash cart".  The most important thing is that we keep our design open and public, so if/when we give up on it, someone else can get some use out of it. 
<br />
<br />So that's my view on things, what do you all think?
<br />
<br />btw, there is a "stage 4" bouncing around in my head, but I really can't imagine completing the first three at this point:)

<br />
<br />It stinks that we may never get around that solder problem, but the $39 difference in cost for the larger FPGA is really not a big deal to me if the end product is that musch closer to 100% compatibility.  It would be totally worth it to me to spend the extra, and I don't think that if it were made into a a real product that the extra $40 would mean any less sales revenue.

<br />
<br />If you use an FPGA, you're going to need something to configure it.  I'm mostly familiar with Altera parts, so I know Altera has what is essentially a flash chip with a pre-programmed CPLD on it to take care of programming the SRAM on the flash at startup (though making it work right on the board is a pain in the ass; we're using it on the current project).  The other problem you run into is that it takes a brief period of time to program the FPGA.  It's a fraction of a second in the case of our board at work (a medium-sized Stratix II), but that's still many clock cycles.  You'd need some way to keep the NES in reset all that time.
<br />
<br />I think a CPLD is what you want.  Like I said, I'm mostly familiar with Altera hardware, since that's what we work with at my job for the most part, so I can recommend a MAX II.  They're LUT-based (as opposed to macrocell-based), and can handle a fairly large design within them.  You're not really going to get away with producing this thing on the cheap; circuit board production and assembly costs are probably going to outweigh the CPLD costs for a medium-sized build (say, a few hundred).  The largest MAX II (in the slowest speed grade, because we're only talking about 2 MHz) is about $40 from Digi-key, but it's a BGA part and you're not going to be assembling that yourself (even the 100-PQFP is pretty dicey to self-assemble).
<br />
<br />On the bright side, voltage level converters are not really a problem.  For 5v PCI-&gt;3.3v FPGA conversion (remember, you don't have to convert back up to 5v; TTL switching threshold is a bit above 2v, and 3.3v CMOS switches up to just about 3.3v) we use Quickswitches.  Look them up, they're fantastic little devices that do a great job of converting 5v logic levels to 3.3v if you hook 'em up right.  And they're dirt cheap, and you can find ones with gobs of channels.
<br />
<br />And finally, don't diddle around with schematic capture; HDLs are the way to go for most serious designs, especially memory mappers.
<br />
<br />I really think this is a great idea, and I've been working on the design for an SNES one in my head for a long time now.  The FPGA is really the ideal way to go (Cyclone IIs are absolutely perfect for this, and they're pretty cheap as well), as long as you can work that reset business out.  I think producing this is going to cost more than you think, though, especially once you factor in the 2 or 3 board spins it usually takes to work out most of the bugs.
<br />
<br />I might be interested in helping, given the time; I don't usually have a lot of time to commit these days.

<br />
<br />Another alternative, of course, is to have the configuration CPLD output an infinite loop sequence at startup until the FPGA can take control of the bus, or switch in a menu ROM to tell the FPGA which data off the SD card to load.  There are a number of possibilities.  The menu ROM is the one I was planning for my SNES ROM emulator which I never found the time to make, but it seems like a worthwhile thing to pursue.
<br />
<br />One other thing to consider is instead of an SD card, try a generic USB mass storage device (like a thumbdrive, or an SD reader even).  The USB interface isn't that hard (there are even some OpenCores cores for the interface, or there's the Cypress SL811HS, which is an excellent interface chip), and the protocol can actually be taken care of in the menu ROM.
