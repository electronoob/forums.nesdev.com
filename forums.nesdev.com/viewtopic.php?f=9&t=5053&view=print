		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey,
<br />
<br />I'm a little confused with how nintendulator's read out works cause it says street fighter 12 peoples is a mmc3\mmc6 with 128k chr and 128 prm. Well it doesn't mention ram or anything else so does that mean that a TLROM board will work or no? Am I gonna actually need a TSROM or SNROM so I got ram? I was really hoping to keep the TSROM board to make FF3j english and my SNROM board for ff2j english but I really want to build up this street fighter game. If it's of any use I'll be using 27c1000 128k chips for this project.
<br />
<br />Sorry if my questions seem noob I just don't want to waste my boards as I only have so many mmc3 boards and only so many eproms. I figure why waste my time if some seasoned vets of the nes can answer my question(s) from experience with ease and save myself ALOT of headaches. I just want to get the hang of making a few of the more popular NES proto's and conversions but it seems I'm not catching on as quick as I'd like to be.
<br />
<br />Thanks In Advance!

<br />Unfortunately I may not be able to answer your question accurately but I want to give you a little pointer on how to ask question.  First of all, this community is quite niche.  If you arrive with a comment like this one above, you're kind of telling them that you're not willing to do an effort in the first place.  This kind of comment may not bring as many answer has you might expect.  So be careful how you present your question since it may backfire on you. Just my 2 cent.
<br />
<br />For the rom info, I know that Nestopia seems to give good info in general but I don't know how accurate it can be for pirate cart since they use non standard mapper usually.
<br />
<br />For your board question, maybe the current wiki may have the information you're looking for.
<br />
<br />I know it may not be what you were looking for but I hope it will help you in some way.

<br />Thanks for the reply. I was just trying to form my posting as polite as possible. I am actually willing to do as much leg work as it takes for any project so I am very sorry if I came across otherwise.

<br />
<br />It's not that your reply was not written in a polite way, it just that it didn't show any intention for doing effort indirectly.  People are always willing to help when they see effort.
<br />
<br />I hope the new wiki that we're working on will have a section to help people doing repro/dev carts. But this will take a while before it becomes available thought.  I will see what I can do.

<br />
<br />Thanks alot! If you want you could even just PM me any info you find out if you like. I plan on making a "how to" page when I get a few different games made up. I'm gonna be sure to make it totally straight forward with all the info I've had to gather from here and there but put it all in one place, with links and diagrams BUT from the sounds of things this is already in the works for the wiki page.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well it seems the only real difference is the OE and A16 being switched on a 27c1000 vs a 27c010. OE is pin 2 instead of pin 24 on the 27c1000 and A16 is pin 24 instead of pin 2. Looks like this will the same as with the atari and the 27c1000 actually saves you time as you don't need to rewire as much with a 27c1000 vs a 27c010. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I'll try to make a couple carts and report back with my results.
