		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />While on vacation in the south of japan, I was able to find a family computer keyboard boxed and it seems complete. Didn't have time to test it yet since I will only be able to test it once back in Tokyo.
<br />
<br />just want to know if the instruction manual could have any value for the community?  I could always try to figure out how to scan it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The box came with an instruction manual that is around 100 pages.  There was 2 fliers about the tape recorder for saving data and another thing and some kind of thin Q/A manual that I didn't check yet (must be for troubleshooting I guess).
<br />
<br />If play power already scanned it, there is no point in scanning it again I guess.  I can always scan the flier if it was not already done. I'm always curious about any publicity related thing for the nes/famicom so I guess there must be other people that have the same interest. At the time, family basic cost was around 15000 yen. That's seems quite expensive for just a keyboard + basic add-on.  the tape recorder was 10000 yen.  If you add the cost of all of them together based on the currency at the time, it would be a lot more expensive then the current gen console.
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />
<br />I think I found the website mentioned above (playpower) and they said "Perhaps it's possible to find a copy of the manual, and have it translated?".  This almost imply that they don't have a manual at the moment.  Can someone confirms it?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />ok then. I will be back to Tokyo tonight and I should have time to browse the manual to see what it actually contain.  
<br />
<br />From the picture I saw on the web, I may be missing something. There seems to be an extra sheet/manual with some sprite on it.  I guess most of the information must be in the main manual so I shouldn't worry too much for now.
<br />
<br />I will try to test the scanner that comes with the printer that someone lend me. What would be the best format for distribution thought.. One thing for sure, I don't want to cut it before scanning it so I need to test to see how it comes out.

<br />PlayPower scanned it. I uploaded it and posted the link in the IRC channel before, but I think it expired. I'm uploading it again. 90 meg PDF.
<br />

<br />
<br />I checked the content and it is the same as mine.  There is no need to scan it again then. 
<br />
<br />The only thing different is that they scanned the first flier and put it at the beginning.  In the one I had there was one extra flier + troubleshooting guide.  They may have not much value but I could always try to scan them someday.
<br />
<br />I just tested it... The keyboard is quite a pain when you're used to new one. The key are small are not very ergonomic. But I guess that how it was at the time, similar to the C64 (I'm not bashing the C64, I had one as a kid).
