So that is different...  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></div><br />Just for the record, this specifically means your program has hit an invalid instruction. It usually happens when your program counter runs through data instead of code.<br /><br />This should be a fairly easy one to debug by logging, because it's pretty likely the program halts very soon after the issue, instead of a wild goose chase when it could be anything like before.</div>

(You usually don't, and it's actually faster to not use them if the temp ram value is on the zero page.)
<br />
<br />You've got a path in your code where it hits a pha without a pla or vice versa.

<br />
<br />I second Kasumi's suggestion: avoid using the stack for temporary storage unless you absolutely need it. When you use the stack in the middle of code that makes decisions it's very easy forget bytes on it or pull more than you've pushed. A corrupted stack is absolutely disastrous, 99.99% of the time your program will crash because of it.

<br />Well, then that's what you have to find out now. When you do a JSR, the current program counter is put on the stack so that later you can return to the place where the call was made. If you do any stack manipulation after that, you must make sure to leave the stack exactly like it was before such manipulation, so that the return address can be used by the RTS. Your program crashed because it returned to an invalid address, so you have to find out why there was an invalid address on the stack by the time the RTS was executed.

<br />Does that not work? Then what errors are you getting?
<br />
<br />I did this:

<br />And it loaded #$01 and #$90 as expected.

<br />sorry, i read the error message fully slowly and found that my sister's file wasn't included and can't be included.  Thank you I'm sorry.

<br />Yeah, there are things this simulator just doesn't do. I find it good to test small pieces of code and study how the CPU works, but you really can't expect it to interpret correctly large portions of game code made for another assembler.
<br />
<br />Back when I was getting started on NES programming, I actually used this simulator as my assembler, as it can save binaries. The biggest issue is the lack of "INCBIN", so all your data has to be defined in text form with "DB" and "DW" statements.

When you use the stack in the middle of code that makes decisions it's very easy forget bytes on it or pull more than you've pushed. A corrupted stack is absolutely disastrous, 99.99% of the time your program will crash because of it.</div><br /><br />Thank you Kasumi and tokumaru for helping me to learn through all of this! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">3gengames wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">there wouldn't be any more code from the subroutine not shown would there? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div><br />There MUST be a part of the subroutine he's not showing. If that's the complete routine, that PLA obviously screws things up by removing part of the return address from the stack.</div><br />Yes 3gengames that wasn't the whole routine... if it was I would have included the function's label at the top.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  It's much longer.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">unregistered wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> I don't have a clue what was on the stack...</div><br />Well, then that's what you have to find out now. When you do a JSR, the current program counter is put on the stack so that later you can return to the place where the call was made. If you do any stack manipulation after that, you must make sure to leave the stack exactly like it was before such manipulation, so that the return address can be used by the RTS. Your program crashed because it returned to an invalid address, so you have to find out why there was an invalid address on the stack by the time the RTS was executed.</div>
<br />Thank you tokumaru <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />; you are wise, I still think. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />In a decent debugger, watching for writes to CPU memory $0100-$01FF should catch all pushes.

<br />Is FCEUX a decent debugger?  I tried to set that breakpoint and it only found all of the zeroing out at the beginning.
