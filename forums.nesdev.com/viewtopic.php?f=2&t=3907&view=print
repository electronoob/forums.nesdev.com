		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I know I've been asking a lot of questions lately, but I'm just trying to solve a certain problem.
<br />
<br />What I need to know now is what happens when you change the way each side of the pattern table is divided through bit 7 of the value written to $8000.
<br />
<br />Say, if I have the sprite side ($1xxx) divided into 4 1KB banks and the background side ($0xxx) divided into 2 2KB banks, with a few known banks already switched in. If I then changed bit 7 of $8000, what exactly would happen?
<br />
<br />Would everything that was already mapped simply change sides (the same 4 banks that were mapped for the sprites would then mapped for the background, and vice versa for the 2 2KB banks)? Or would something more complicated happen?
<br />
<br />EDIT: Yeah, some preliminary tests show that yeah, whatever was mapped in one side goes to the other. I guess it was stupid of me to ask this, I could just have tested out, like I just did. But then again, since I tried this in an emulator, it would be nice if someone could confirm this is what happens on a real MMC3, someone that already knows this from past experience. Thanks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />All MMC3 commercial games I've checked does never change the value of the highest 2 bits when writing to $8000, they just use a fixed combination and never change again. I see no clear doccumentation on what happen exactly, and I think the only way to know is to test. Also test on a real MMC3, not any emulator nor the powerpack to confirm this, as no commercial nor homembrew games I know does something like this yet.
<br />I cannot test myself cause I have no EPROM programmer at the momment.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A funny thing about this, when I was first starting in nesdev, I thought the MMC3's chr banks acted like ram, so if I set 4 banks on one side of the pattern table, and then flipped that bit, and set 4 banks on the other side of the pattern table, I'd get 8 banks instead of 6.
<br />
<br />Needless to say, I was wrong. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />Some early emulators might have actually implemented mapper 4 CHR switching that way, as if it were RAMBO-1 and not MMC3.
<br />
<br />So who volunteers to write the test ROM for this?
