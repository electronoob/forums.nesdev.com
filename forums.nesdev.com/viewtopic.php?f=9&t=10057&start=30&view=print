I have a hacker solution for you.  Lift the A18 pin (referenced from the flash chip's datasheet) on the PRG-ROM from the PCB.  Connect it to GND. Dump it as UOROM 256KB (that's your lower half).  Disconnect from GND, connect to Vcc, dump again.  Remove the header from the second dump and append to the first.  Adjust remaining header to 512KB and enjoy.  Reconnect the lifted pin if desiring to replay on the NES.<br /><br />No soldering iron?  I have an even bigger hacked solution for you.  Take it even further with a slightly less approved no-solder method.  Scrounge the drawers for a paperclip (a metal one).  Take the cover off you NES &amp; cart so you can access the PCB (PRG-ROM specifically) while dumping.  For the few seconds it takes to dump, short the A18 pin to Gnd with your paperclip &amp; dump.  Short to Vcc and dump again.  Create file as directed above.  Sure this option stresses your A18 OR gate output driver a little, but if it's only for a min or less it should be just fine.  Put your thumb on the OR gate(s)  for a temporary little heat sink. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div><br /><br />This is in no way fun for me.  But if this is what it takes to get a rom of a game I legitimately own, I guess I'll do what I have to do.  I have no idea what the heck I'm doing.  I guess if I can't figure out how to edit an ASM to build a new BIN, I'll follow your soldering tip.  Thanks for that, at least <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

In any event, the jumpers that are closed would suggest the PCB is limiting it to 8KB of CHR-RAM.

I use them alot as the common donors that have them are also ones that support larger banked games that need both U1 and U2 for the program data and the SRAM needs to be removed anyhow <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Bank switching on the Atari is alot like mapper implimentation on the NES for larger amounts of code if your not up on Atari. Anyhow, if you search around you can still get the 7800 games with 8k static ram in them for dirt cheap in large quantities. It's pretty sad when parts of the boards population are worth more than the game as a whole though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I created USBCopyNESBlue because at the time neither CopyNESW nor USBCopyNESW were functional. Sorry about the name, it was chosen hastily. (I changed the icon colour so I could see it was a new version easily, and named it after the new icon colour.) I know it's working because I already use it, and I knew serpentor was already using it, and I provided a mappers.dat that I knew would work with the version of the program he has.<br /><br />I don't particularly like having another fork of this around, but I have some questions about CopyNESW:<br />- Does CopyNESW have a source repository that I can examine?<br />- Do you keep changelogs?<br />- Are old versions of the source available?<br />- Can I contribute to its development?<br /><br />As an alternative, maybe you would like to join the USBCopyNESBlue project on google code? It would be easier to collaborate, and the public repository automatically answers the questions I just asked. I was planning to do some work on it in a few weeks anyway, it could be a good time for me to integrate your changes and bring in parallel port support. (If it needs a name change, that can be accomodated too.)
