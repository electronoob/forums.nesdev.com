Hi! <br /><br />After months of NES hacking and learning how things work, I decided it was time to start my own project.<br />Since I don't have the patience (nor time) to read tutorials from A-Z, I started right away with the knowledge I got from hacking and ofcourse this forum/wiki.<br /><br />I use NESASM3, but it was mostly because that was the first entry I found on google  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> <br />It works, but I will try other compilers to see what fits me best.<br /><br />So here is what I got so far:<br /><br />Standard PPU waiting, RAM clearing, palettes, APU, stack and so forth..<br />So far a single black screen with a background pointer in game so it can be changed easily<br />A four part animated and movable sprite (Spiny!)<br />My own controller reader routine <br />A pause screen setup to halt gameplay<br />Some flying bubblesprites for comming sprite collision detection (yet to be done)<br />Boundry control for no wrap around right-left and top-down<br /><br />For debug and testing purposes I also included a basic frame counter and a Sprite X/Y output.<br /><br />So far, the code is a bit messy and I rather not share until cleanup  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />What now then? Where to start for making it into &quot;a game&quot;?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6478">mikaelmoizt</a> — Mon Jul 28, 2014 4:33 am</p><hr />
