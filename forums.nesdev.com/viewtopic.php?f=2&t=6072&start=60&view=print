<br />
<br />He spotted an opportunity and jumped on it.  If he doubles his money, good for him.
<br />
<br />It's not like Battlekid will sell any fewer copies because people will buy from this guy instead.  All the copies this guy (and guys like him) can sell must've been bought legit.
<br />
<br />Maybe after this auction ends (or even before it ends) people will google the game to find out what's up with it and they'll come across the official page.  If anything it's like free promotion.
<br />
<br />Now if they start copying the carts and selling them... that's another story.  But that doesn't seem to be the case here, so I don't see what the problem is.

I just don't support scalpers in general. It's my opinion and other people don't have to agree with it.  
<br />
<br />I remember for the PS3 in Japan, some "business man" (...) were paying beggars to wait in line so they could get a PS3 and resell it after. That's not ok.
<br />
<br />Another way of seeing it is if all games ends up on ebay because people are not aware of retrozone and pay up double or more of the price, this is less money that retrozone and the author receive. This money could have been used by them to produce new products. It's not like retrozone is a large company and have a publicity budget or something.
<br />
<br />For now it's only 1 case, no big fuzz.  Just hope it doesn't become a trend.

They sell just as many copies as they would if Joe Gamer bought from them direct.  Possibly even more since there's no guarantee that the scalper will be able to flip the product.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I remember for the PS3 in Japan, some "business man" (...) were paying beggars to wait in line so they could get a PS3 and resell it after.

<br />I don't see what's wrong with that.  It's an investment.

<br />What glitch is this?  Sounds interesting.

<br />Then there's also secret passwords for debug mode and a secret level.  <span style="color: #222244">IAMHAX0R and PETUNIAX</span>
<br />
<br />I also notice that you get stuck in walls for a frame, but I'm not sure if you can wallkick, since that requires frame-precise timing (TAS).
<br />
<br />And thanks to the debug mode password, I found the illusion wall.
<br />
<br />Edit: Figured out the invincibility glitch.

<br />It's good for the buyer as well if it's available in limited quantities and underpriced. A scalper ensures that those who <em>really</em> want it will get it. It's like so-called price gougers when there's a shortage of e.g. water or gasoline. If they didn't jack up the price, the first few people to come through would empty them out.
<br />
<br />What's the criticism others have though? A scalper pays for it like anyone else. Once he does so, it's his. Then he is free to charge whatever he wants, and potential buyers are free to decline paying what he's charging. If nobody bought his stuff, he'd have to lower his prices or find a new line of work. So you might as well blame those that buy from a scalper as well, since they are essential to his operation.
