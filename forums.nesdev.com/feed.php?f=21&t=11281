Sorry for the resurrection. I just want to add my two cents. I think the palette becomes more balanced once you specify a 9300k white point per NTSC-J spec:<br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/agzpDuf.png" alt="Image" /><br />I say this despire not being a fan of non-D65 white points. There's no denying that the palette was designed around 9300k and might as well be simulated for NES content IMO. Additionally my eyes agree with @lidnariq on a brigtness setting -0.075. Especially since it ends up with a suitable brightness when used with a scan line effect. My IPS display is calibrated to sRGB, gamma 2.3, 120cd/m2.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9048">markanini</a> — Fri Mar 16, 2018 4:03 pm</p><hr />

Hey Drag, <br /><br />Ive been using the settings for :<br /><br />{-0.25, 0.8, -0.2, 1.0, 1.0}<br />This is a slightly darker palette, but represents the colors a lot more faithfully, for instance, I can actually tell what hues the lightest colors are, just like I can with my TV. If you're looking to design some graphics and you really need an accurate representation of the colors and how they contrast against each other, this is what I'd recommend. Even though I said this palette is darker, you don't even notice unless you have something BRIGHT WHITE open next to your emulator.<br /><br />This palette is pretty awesome. One question, is there something i can do to make the palette retain the green color from the border on the second stage of contra for nes? It is supposed to look like this:<br /><br /><img src="http://cdn.wikimg.net/strategywiki/images/0/02/Contra_NES_Stage_2a.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />but instead it is just one single gray color, hardly any green. When this palette is used in conjunction with the ntsc filter it really shines. Just a few little tweaks and it will be almost perfect. Just figured i would ask since you know more about the settings on the palette generator page than i do. I always remember the nes colors being dark and gritty than most emulators show. Do you know what i can do to retain this green back and possibly just lighten up things just a tiny hair?<br /><br />anyways this palette generator is awesome, thanks for all you have put into it. Im definitely getting use of it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4387">*Spitfire_NES*</a> — Sun Oct 19, 2014 7:34 pm</p><hr />

Normal sRGB images will appear oversaturated on them. Most web browsers nowadays can be made to color manage these images, that is, convert their values from sRGB to the monitor's native primaries. I have not seen any NES emulator provide that functionality. Therefore, it would be useful to specify the target monitor's primaries to generate the correct colors directly. Another advantage of this is that on these monitors, saturated reds and greens can be seen without them needing to be clipped (as much).<br /><div class="quotetitle">Drag wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The custom colorimetry was a quick afterthought, so it doesn't do any scaling or anything like that.

All this with linear values (the ones you use for color space conversion), not gamma-correct values.<br /><br />By the way: if you wanted to get really crazy, you could emulate differential phase distortion as well. Basically, your current hue setting is amplitude-independent, so it influences the hue shift at zero amplitude. You could add a second hue setting that is multiplied with Y, resulting in a total hue shift for any pixel of baseHue+Y*diffHue. While it does replicate what is definitely going on in some devices, it might be a bit far out there for emulation purposes.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=133">NewRisingSun</a> — Mon Aug 04, 2014 12:05 am</p><hr />

Should you decide to add these, you might want to separate the RGB primaries from the white point. Note that when trying to simulate D93 white on sRGB, the blue value will become greater than 1, so everything must be scaled accordingly.

A few questions, if I may, from someone who has spent way too much time on the NES palette himself:<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>How are you normalizing video levels? Are you just treating color 0x0E as black and colors 0x20 and colors 0x30 as white?</li><li>Are you using the color burst amplitude as an amplitude reference for the chroma signals?</li><li>What does a hue of -0.25 actually mean? How many degrees is that? I notice that 360 degrees (meaning no change) is at about 31.4, so it seems to be related to radians. Better specify it in degrees, because that is what the television literature does.</li><li>Are you taking US NTSC's 7.5% setup into account? It seems you do, given that the default brightness and contrast settings are different from zero, though to a larger extent than 7.5% setup would do.</li></ol><br />Suggestions:<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>I assume that &quot;colorimetry&quot; refers to the colorimetry of the emulated (&quot;source&quot;) display, and that the target display is always sRGB. Since wide-gamut displays are quite widespread these days, allowing to select the target display colorimetry might be desirable as well.</li><li>There are at least two more white points that were (and to some extent are) in widespread use: 9300K+27MPCD (xWhite  0.281, yWhite  0.311) and CIE D93 (xWhite  0.285, yWhite  0.293). Should you decide to add these, you might want to separate the RGB primaries from the white point. Note that when trying to simulate D93 white on sRGB, the blue value will become greater than 1, so everything must be scaled accordingly. Right now that is not done when entering these as custom values.</li><li>I understand you are using the default YIQ/YUV to RGB matrix.

sorry for the long delay in my reply. I am using mainly an hd lcd tv. I found that bumping up the brightness on the settings in the emu by about 10 seem to get it pretty good. <br /><br />Great work on everything sir!  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" /> The nes palette has been a long standing discussion (that often) seems to have no true and definitive answer lol.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4387">*Spitfire_NES*</a> — Sun Jul 13, 2014 6:00 pm</p><hr />
