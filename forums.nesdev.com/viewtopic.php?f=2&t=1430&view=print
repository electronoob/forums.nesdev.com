Since we know basically nothing about it, it probably means this device sucked so much that nobody cared about it.<br /><br />The cartridge is NROM with 2k SRAM, which means your programs can only fit in 2kb, which is extremely small, and you can't use your own graphics.<br /><br />That being said, even though it was the first programming language I ever learnt, Basic is horrible, and I probably never want to ever code anything in basic again !<br />Its even much worse than assembly, those line numbers, lack of any indentation and goto statements that goes everywhere is the most unfriendly possible way to program something (after piercing holes in a piece of paper to represent bits, like they did in the 60's).
