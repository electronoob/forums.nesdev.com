		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I recently bought Pandemonium for my iPhone and as I played it, I realized it has a very Sonic the Hedgehog speed and feel to it.  Since there is no real Sonic game for the Saturn (3D blast sucks, Sonic Jam was a compilation and Sonic R is just a joke) and Pandemonium was originally a Saturn/PSX game, I got to thinkin: How hard would it be to hack in the 3D model for Sonic from Sonic R to replace the female character in Pandemonium?  She even does a forward flip when you double jump, making it an almost perfect transition for a Sonic model.  I don't know what kind of knowledge is out there and how difficult it is to hack Saturn games, but I figured if anyone knew, they would probably hang out around here.  I just think it would be hella cool to put Sonic in Pandemonium given the gameplay and level design is dead on to what a good Sonic game should be.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Swapping a 3d model is neither simple nor easy, especially on a console game.
<br />It'd involve allot of remapping since I'm sure the texture would fit if you just swapped 'em.
<br />
<br />
<br />PC games aren't so hard, well not the mod friendly games anyway.
<br />(gta3 anyone?)

<br />I can't say yes or no, because I don't know.
<br />That'd be pretty cool though.
<br />I not much of a PC gamer, I have been thinking of getting a new PC though.
<br />
<br />
<br />Maybe some of us should get together and develop a motal combat type game where you can add your own or new characters. 
<br />An example would be something similar to soul calibur that has preset characters. But other then soul calibur, you can add a folder that contains the data for new characters. Custom tracks would also be cool.
