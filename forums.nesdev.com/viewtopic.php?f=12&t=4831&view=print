		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Back in the days when Donkey Kong Country was released there was a big hype about it. This "new" ACM (Advanced Computer Modelling) technology that made the games look like 64-bit. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />Obviously the graphics were rendered in 3D, not that exciting really. 
<br />But did this ACM-technology include anything else than just 3D rendered graphics? Since the game is "only" 32megabit I suspect they might have some nice compression technology to allow those amounts of graphics, but that's my own theory.
<br />Anyway, anyone knows more? Just curious.. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />I would think they use some sort of compression, either that or they reuse the tiles REALLY intelligently.
<br />
<br />As a side note, you say it's 32 megabit. I don't mean to be an ass, but why not say it's 4 Megabytes? What's so special about a megabit anyways?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />"ACM" was just a marketing term (like Blast Processing) used to hype the game's extensive use of pre-rendered 3D graphics, something which was relatively new to console games. None of the three DKC games used any special mapper hardware or anything.

<br />
<br />Depending on VRAM usage ofcourse, but I doubt compression was used on sprites, but maybe background tiles. Or, maybe none at all. VRAM would have to fit alot of sprites if you were to compress them as real time decompression wouldn't be doable. You could always open it in a tile editor.
