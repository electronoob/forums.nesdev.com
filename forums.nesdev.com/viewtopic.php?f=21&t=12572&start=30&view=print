In fact the large orange stalactites are using the same palette (for some reason they seem to be sprites as well even though they never move).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@Sik:  I was referring to how the lift appears to be a &quot;solid brick&quot; when it's graphic doesn't look like it.  Perhaps he was trying to emulate the limitations of moving BG tiles, but since it's moving, it should be classified as a sprite.  It's hard to see the &quot;solid brick&quot;, but believe me when I say it's there.<br /><br />@Tokumaru, Hawken:  Yes, I am indeed talking about the OP's little animation and demo.  I hope the OP will stick to the limits while still delivering a charming slick game, maybe even share the source code.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 65%; line-height: normal">While I have no idea what the precise reasoning is (very likely technological ones), I can't help but feel that the NES was born at the wrong time.  It was designed at a time when archaic arcade design philosophies were the norm, and thus many original games feel like arcade games.  By the time developers started giving their games more substance, the NES was already old news, and even major developers like Nintendo themselves stopped caring about their NES output.  In short, the NES doesn't have anything nearly as deep or long as Link's Awakening, despite it being developed for technically even weaker hardware than the NES.</span>

I'm pretty sure somebody already has a code for all of these things.<br /><br />bg map scrolling = common<br />object handling = common<br />gravity = common<br />collision = common
