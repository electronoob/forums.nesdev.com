		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Seeing that title screen, i immediately think of russian space posters from the 50s and 60s. They would often pair two (or more) faces against a space/rocket backdrop. Note how they are in harmony with each other, in one team, in unison. The artists were very conscious about position and direction. The hint i get from your title screen is that the two ships/pilots are in opposition, and that it's therefore maybe a 2 player versus game. <br /><br />I'm attaching a zip with some selected moodboard pictures.<br /><br />I would align the top and bottom bars/lines so they were in parallel with the text in &quot;two&quot; and &quot;ships&quot;.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />These are great points, thanks! I wasn't directly thinking of soviet propaganda but I wanted a poster like feel to it, and to give the ships some personality by showing the pilots.<br /><br />The game is single player, and currently involves having two ships, which you can swap between at any time. If you lose a ship, it's out. Once you lose both ships, game over. The intention is to give the player a nice risk/reward mechanic - do you charge up both ships equally, or just one and use it all the time with the risk you might gradius yourself back to nothing, or do you play it super safe and keep a powered up ship in reserve? <br /><br />How does the attached look?<br /><br />I've experimented a bit with some gridding as well, to break up the black space. If anyone particularly hates it, please let me know. <br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the grid is a good idea. It also helps frame the rest which otherwise can feel a bit 'floating'. <br /><br />Maybe you could experiment with making the heads bigger and place them closer to their ships? You can also use black for shadows in faces, hair (especially those two) and ship details more than you have currently. <br /><br />If the graphics for the ships are used in some option / fluff splash screen detailing their capabilities, you might want to reconsider not using them for the title screen. Maybe a darker silhoute from the side (black is your friend, it conserves tile space)? <br /><br />^ Not strong opinions, just a bit of brain storming.

The shading of the ships and portraits also look awesome - I see what you were talking about when you said use black - i didn't think two tone hair would make so much of a difference.<br /><br />What I'll probably do is take it and try and learn from it, if that's alright - so the final edition of it will look worse then yours, but at least at least I will hopefully have developed a little bit.

Learning, using, altering... it's your design. I just toyed around a bit. <br /><br />Just another quick edit. This was done to make the left and right edges a bit more safe (as i did with the small print before), but the extra hair colour/sun light and left-aligned title was a bonus. The head pairing could be done anyways.<br /><br />Edit: Spelling.
