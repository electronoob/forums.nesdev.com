		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Don't know if it is any original, it is just got into my head, and I thought to post it here. Currently there are separate boards for NES and Famicom. What if they will be combined into one? Like, two side connectors, one at top, other at bottom, two sets of holes, so the same board could be put into a NES cart case, or flipped and put into a Famicom cart case (possibly with cutting off unneeded pieces).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I got a similar idea a couple of months ago, mine was having a hybrid cart that could be plugged in either system. But the best result from that would be some fugly looking carts (and would require custom casing), so I think your idea is much more practical.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The main issue is that NES and FC have different board thicknesses, so to do it properly one slot would require a separate PCB that is secured to the main one. Not a big deal for expensive development items, but for cheap game production, if customers have only one system the increased cost from two PCBs and additional assembly time probably isn't justified.

It's a good idea I think, but there were a few deal breakers for me.  Namely the case issue.  I couldn't answer the question as to what cases they'd go into, so it was hard to define how to ever actually use them.  That and I started to gain other goals for my project which interfered with signal routing and board space so I dropped the idea.<br /><br />If a board were designed for the sole purpose of publishing a game and the case issue were solved I think it'd be a great way to go.  Routing would be pretty simple and assuming it wasn't too complex of mapper setup I'd think you should be able to fit the extra size of a unused 72pin inside a common sized FC/dendy case especially if you used surface mount components.
