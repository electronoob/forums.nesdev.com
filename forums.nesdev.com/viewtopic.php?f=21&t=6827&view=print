<br />This would be very difficult, considering the wide variety of needs for every game.  You have to provide for every combination of 8/16/24/32 height character, 8/16/24/32 width character, 2/3/4/5/6 frame run animation, jump animations, shoot animations.  All shapes and sizes and animations of enemies, top down, side view, diagonal.  8x8 bricks, 16x16 bricks, or the odd kind that straddle boundaries.  Basic rectangular trees, or the type that make up the entire background.
<br />
<br />And every single bullet, sparkle, or particle is likely to be a copyright infringement anyway, intentional or unintentional.
<br />
<br />How many pixels must be different for it to be legal?  Several per 8x8 tile, I assume.  Can we just host a sprite of Mario sans moustache and with dithered clothes?

<br />Any "substantial similarity" is evidence of copying. But "scenes a faire" lets one get away with cases where similarity is unavoidable in the genre, as seen in <em>Capcom v. Data East</em>. For example, see how different <a href="http://nfggames.com/games/mariosprites/" class="postlink">all these Mario sprites</a> are while still being recognizable as derivative from Mario. On the other hand, Milon is effectively Noddy's head on Mario's body, but it's not recognized as too derivative.

<br />
<br />I bet Nintendo could come after us for a lot of reasons other than art theft: reverse engineering proprietary software and hardware, unlicensed development, trade secrete violation, whatever, I'm no lawyer but I'm sure they could come up with something if they wanted to.
<br />
<br />Fortunately they don't seem to want to fuck us up, and possibly the game companies realize that retro homebrewing presents no threat to them. So I guess you can get away with using ripped graphics as placeholders until an artist is interested in your project. If someone does bother you, worst thing that can happen is you have to replace your CHR files. Big deal, they're placeholders anyway.

<br />
<br />Also, the art has to be minimally related to the concept of the project, you just just pick anything. I don't know where you guys got the idea that your prototypes will look better using generic art. Think about it, after 2 or 3 developers use the same tiles they'll loose all their appeal, and no artist will find projects using them interesting at all. If anything projects will actually start to look duller and duller.
<br />
<br />I really doubt that this sprite bank idea will work. Trust me you're better off drawing your own art, even if you think it looks terrible. You get the interest of artists with game mechanics, not graphics. Graphics don't impress good artists, they know how to make them! Also, I'm sure many artists like the challenge of making terrible art good. When I see bad art I have an urge to draw my own version just to see how much better I can do. So if other artists are anything like I am, you even have more chances of getting their interest if your art is bad, as long as the gameplay is polished enough.

<br />I don't think I've done this with finished (or close to that) games... it's more like the case of that Sonic 2 LD project... The programmers needs a few sprites and a few candidates show up with some material, but if I think they are not good enough I get the urge to give it a try too. The originals aren't necessarily terrible, I just sometimes think they could be better. Sometimes I don't succeed though, and don't consider my own versions good enough either (in which case I don't show them! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />).

<br />I feel the exact same way. Improving someone else's art is a kind of challenge, so it keeps us interested, and it doesn't feel like total exploitation because we can see the programmer did the best he could.

<br />
<br />A funny story about that, actually...
<br />
<br />If you look in a couple of games from that era, there are a *lot* of player characters that use this exact same walk cycle. Balloon Fight, all of pre-SMB2 Mario, Bomberman and Lode Runner (NES), Challenger, Japanese Maniac Mansion even has a similar walk cycle. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />It's just like the generic arcade font I included with the tileset, I've always wondered about the origins of both.
<br />
<br />and yeah, I'll draw a more proper player character later, I just wanted to throw in one that used that particular walk cycle for personal appeal. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />Here they are so far in both brown and grey versions.

<br />*replaced with PNG versions, per req.

<br />
<br />These are simple 3 color sprite sets. To get the most out of the color palette, I reused the hair color as the highlight color for the jacket and pants, which limits how these sprites can be colored, but I still think they look OK. (considering the limitations.)
<br />
<br />I haven't tested the animations yet, but there is a run/walk, a "Crouch", "Pant/heave", and a "Punch" animation in the set.
<br />
<br />There are some "eye-less" frames, since wombat guy wanted some kind of "idle" animation.  I might add 2 more frames for the crouch, so that in the fully crouched condition he continues to "breathe", but I'll leave that up to wombat guy if he likes what I have so far.
<br />
<br />If anybody else wants some sprites, I am available on weekends. Stop by the IRC channel, and drop me a line. I work second shift, so I get up late in the afternoon CST.
