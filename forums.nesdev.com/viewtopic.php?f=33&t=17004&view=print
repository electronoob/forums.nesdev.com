Good job. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Two things you maybe want to consider (or then again not. btw i don't feel strongly about either of these points):<br /><br />-Watch out for large fields of checkerboard. Might not turn out the way you want on hardware. Then again, it's a stylism you seem to have actively chosen and used consistently, which can sometimes be far more important than to avoid every little technical hickup there is, imo.<br /><br />-At that large size and level of detail of the character/title, i feel like i'm missing solid fill-field shadows and highlight fields on the character to give it some depth and sense of light direction. Up to you though as that might not be the style you were looking for.

I remember some NES movie tie-in game had to be altered because though they had the movie license, they didn't have the separate license for the lead actor's likeness. (It may or may not have been Bruce Willis; my memory fails me.) This is also my hypothesis as to why the Thomas sprite in IREM's <em>Kung Fu</em> doesn't look much like Jackie Chan in the movie it was based on (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheels_on_Meals" class="postlink"><em>Wheels on Meals</em></a>).

The main character for this was originally (Indian) asian when the game was called SPECIAL TEAM, however I updated the graphics when the concept of banghammer hit. <br /><br />2. My favourite blaxploitation movie is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spook_Who_Sat_by_the_Door_(film)" class="postlink">The Spook who sat by the door</a>. If you haven't seen it, check it out. Made by United Artists, it's the story of a black CIA recruit who causes a new civil war in America. <br /><br />3. Mario is a knock off of Popeye, Solid Snake is a knock off of Kyle Reese, Contra stars Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and I don't imagine Bruce Willis's estate authorized this:<br /><img src="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse4.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.nBfki4zyP2qvpPz_yL_HLwAAAA%26pid%3D15.1&amp;f=1" alt="Image" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well first off, i'll state it again, i *love* the guard. Iconic yellow, iconic helmet, and a really good swing. <br /><br />I think it may be brought forward even more if you experiment a bit with the timing of the durations of each frame/cel in that animation. Think of how quick its subactions take: Preparing for the swing vs doing it. How long does it take for the swing to traverse? How long does the guard need to recoup afterwards? Things like that. Generally, reversing the direction of momentum is slower than moving along the momentum. So that's a good place to start. Sometimes, though, subtle effects can for example express determination or vagueness or other shades of attitude in the character when those rules are played with. Generally speaking, timing of durations can also inform the feeling of weight, size, force and direction of each object that is animated. <br /><br />Some engines don't allow for variable durations, which is fine, too. Every game has its specific priority.

Not in the sprites of the characters and enemies but in the style of the game. I hope that soon the ROM of the game is published to be able to play it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ryoga, I'm glad you think so! This is my attempt at something like a Blue Shadow, another Natsume game (Shadow of the Ninja in the US), and one I absolutely adore! I should be releasing a ROM next week.<br /><br />Frankengraphics, I think I get what you mean, although it took me a while to decipher your zen-like comment.The first frame is immediate on attack, which is the swing forward - you think there could be more lean to it?  Then the second and third are a lean back and a rest, the completion of the swing. I'll experiment with it a bit and see if I can add more weight to it, probably after the first release. I should say, the timings on the gif aren't the timings in the game.<br /><br />For sprite timings theres a general update timer for everyone, and then metasprites can &quot;override&quot; it with their own. I use the general one for things like walking, as it saves cycles and space not having to hardcode everything. I did write a whole new animation engine on Monday, which has bugs and I am not using, and the poor prioritisation of which is likely why I missed the deadline!
