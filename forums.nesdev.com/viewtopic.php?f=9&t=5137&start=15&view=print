<br />You're right, it does make a lot more sense this way - much less prone to mistakes.
<br />Unfortunately I don't think I could possibly try anything I haven't before (for the shift register / input process), and with the same black screen for <em>everything</em> it's gotta be something else - I should've at least seen something on the screen once by now.
<br />Maybe I've made a mistake on the bankswitching -- possibly the CHR side of things?  I haven't changed that since the original code in the first post.

<br />
<br />Here's something that's kind of confusing me though, I pulled out a logic analyzer and took a look at the M2, /CE, R/W, D0, D7, A13, and A14 pins.  I managed to track down the Reset write, the Reg3 writes, and the Reg0 writes - at least I think I did.  They're not quite what I expected.  A write kinda looks like this (I'm gonna try to ACII this):
<br />
<br />M2:   0______1----------------0________
<br />
<br />/CE:  1----------0____________1---------
<br />
<br />R/W: 1--0______________________1---
<br />
<br />And as much as I tried, there is NEVER a rising edge of M2 while /CE is low.  Or, is this waveform just wrong?

<br />
<br />As for how data is valid at the rising edge of "M2", well the data output latch is enabled throughout "M1", but its tri-state buffer is enabled at "M2" &amp;&amp; /RW (but /RW was predecoded through "M1".) With the propagation of input buffers, data arrives before/at the rising edge. Datasheets won't tell you this, but it can be observed by crosschecking the only accurate 6502 diagram: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.weihenstephan.org/~michaste/pagetable/6502/6502.jpg">http://www.weihenstephan.org/~michaste/ ... 2/6502.jpg</a><!-- m --> with the schematic: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.shiresoft.com/downloads/docs/6502.pdf">http://www.shiresoft.com/downloads/docs/6502.pdf</a><!-- m --> .

<br /><a href="http://www.atarimagazines.com/computeii/issue1/page9.php" class="postlink">http://www.atarimagazines.com/computeii/issue1/page9.php</a>
<br />Specifically, Figure. 1 and the paragraph below.
<br />
<br />Datasheets, this one and the other ones on the 6502.org site.
<br /><a href="http://6502.org/documents/datasheets/synertek/synertek_hardware_manual.pdf" class="postlink">http://6502.org/documents/datasheets/synertek/synertek_hardware_manual.pdf</a>
<br />
<br />I'm not sure why datasheets are not valid as they specifically say when devices can guarantee data to be valid from the CPU.
<br />
<br />I hope others could respond as we could go back and forth on this forever.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Also, kathaku I wasn't talking about the CPLD not working.  Just not working when the MMC1 load is in it.  Try loading CPLD with the MMC1 code while using a non MMC1 game that doesn't use any kind of mapper chip.  The game should still run correctly, right?[/url][/quote]

<br /><img src="http://img124.imageshack.us/img124/8845/reg0write.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />So if the data is ready on the rising edge of M2, then D7 is a 1, but if it's on the falling edge of M2, then D7 is a 0.  I thought it would've been the falling edge, because on the rising edge D7 is always 1.
<br />
<br />I could've made a mistake, when I get home tonight I'll try again.

<br />I'm not denying that it's most proper to use the falling edge, just pointing out that designs have had success with the rising edge. If data wasn't arriving in time, lots of designs out there wouldn't work, but they do. I don't think the PowerPak has any input delays on the line, but that would be the first thing to check in the constraints file. 
<br />
<br />I really think the datasheets should be taken with a few lumps of salt, they significantly oversimply the internal workings and the timing doesn't necessarily reflect the 2A03's process.

<br />Although I have yet to make this mapper work with my PLD, I have learned enough to know much more clearly what is going on.  I figure the problem is now something that can be solved with some simulation.
<br />
<br />Thanks to everyone who's helped me out with this - and when it <em>does</em> work, I'll post my working code for all.

<br />
<br />Good luck it will be interesting to see what you find.
<br />
<br />
<br />I'd have to look up more detail of the mapper, but I wonder if you should clear q_s when the count is 5 as well.  I also wonder if checking if count is = to 5 should be in a separate process and synchronize it to M2, but use the opposite M2 polarity of when you clock the data in.  That way there would be a little delay to clock the data in correctly before you transfer it.

<br />What if you burn for example a PRG ROM that is 128KB of size
<br />and the prg_addr_in(14) would be '1'?
<br />It will make the cpu read at the place that it is not programmed.
<br />
<br />The quote in MMC1 specification is that it must be the last bank - the last one that is burned on the ROM (or maybe you will be playing with grames with 256KB of PRGROM only?)
