		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I finally put my CopyNES together and tested it out under WindowsXP.  CopyNESW is an EXCELLENT program!  Really easy to use.  Since I couldn't find a support thread/forum for it, I decided to start this one.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> 
<br />
<br />Here's a list of things I noticed:
<br />
<br />- The copy SRAM memory back to cart feature doesn't seem to work (but I can dump the save game from the cart)
<br />- When I dump a GAR, the BIN file is created in the done plugins directory rather than where normal ROM dumps are stored.  Further more, the program doesn't ask me for the save filename.
<br />- GAR bin dump files seems to be in "locked" mode until CopyNESW exits.
<br />
<br />Lastly, has anyone else noticed that every time you dump a GAR you never get the same BIN file??  About 80% of the file is the same, but the other 20% keeps on changing.  I've dumped 2 different GARs, and their SRAM memory is completly different!

<br />
<br />Maybe the game saves for the last person to use it are part of the file?

<br />
<br />Thanks for pointing that out - a new build is now available to fix this particular bug. I'll take care of the other GAR stuff in a bit.

<br />
<br />I'm not too familiar with basic.  Will it work under XP? Also, is there a reason why the modified file isn't shipped with your version?  (name it something else, and tell users that they can rename it if they have problems).

<br />
<br />The reason I don't include mappers.dat is because some users have updated theirs, and I'd rather not cause them to lose their changes. Besides, the next release of the QBASIC client (whenever kevtris gets around to releasing it) will include these changes.

Anyone able to edit the copynes source and fix said dump problem?</div><br /><br />Can you provide more specifics about the problem they are having? (or a link to the NA thread?) The original TXROM plugin would mess up on 32KB PRG because it would tell the client it was going to send 32K or PRG but it would actually try to send more than that, which the client then would try interpret as the next data block header and aborting because of a bad header.<br /><br />First, make sure they are using the correct binary of the plugin: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/plugins/TXROM1.BIN">http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/plugins/TXROM1.BIN</a><!-- m --> It's possible that the plugin package they are using has the &quot;fixed&quot; source file but the actual binary never got updated.<br /><br />If the problem persists, I may be able to help if I have more info. PM me a copy of the bad dump if you can get it.
