<br />The problem is that this part has nothing to do with the iNES header. These are the CPU vectors, that unlike the header, which goes at the start of the file, should be at the <strong>end</strong> of the ROM. These vectors have absolutely nothing to do with the header, and I find it very weird that you treat them like they are the same thing.
<br />
<br />My guess is that you are producing a ROM with invalid vectors at the end, which causes your program to crash (because the CPU jumps to a location that contains invalid code instead of jumping to your "start" label). Try putting the code above at the end of the source code to put the vectors in the correct place.
<br />
<br />Since I'm not familiar with the assembler you're using and I haven't seen your exact source file(s), I can't be any more specific.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've "copied" the iNES header from this tutorial:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://patater.com/gbaguy/day2n.htm">http://patater.com/gbaguy/day2n.htm</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />It was a bit difficult, according the tutorial, to know what part  was header, what code (without any prior knowledge of NESASM). I thought these lines were part of the header (which was weird in my mind too, I've programmed Atari 6502 machines, for instance with XASM the "header" is simply one line: ORG "address" (for 8-bit Atari computers),  for Atari 2600 with DASM two lines. With the "header" I've used with NESASM everything has worked without problems, I tried to move these four lines at the end of the code, nothing happens, no sound. The program as I described previous post is practically complete source code and it doesn't crash, it works with NESASM, my problem is: how to write iNES header, correct iNES header for DASM or XASM or TASM, these I've found that works in 16-bit MS-DOS, with DASM I've made a first program using only PocketPC for creating, compiling and running it, Atari 2600 .bin, pDOSBOX and PocketVCS. Now I would like to do same (my original target) NES, using DASM/XASM/TASM and PocketNESter.
<br />
<br />Thanks for your help !

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, getting closer, found a better NESASM manual, now I probably know better what's the problem with DASM:
<br />
<br />1. iNES header (is it 16 bytes, so it can be solved by hex editor and copy /b).
<br />
<br />2. Banking: how it is done in DASM.
<br />
<br />Moving those four lines Tokumaru mentioned to the end didn't worked as it needed one line more ie.
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .bank 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .org $fffa <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .dw 0 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .dw start <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .dw 0<br /><br /></div><br /><br />Now it works in NESASM with the header:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.inesprg 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.ineschr 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.inesmir 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.inesmap 0<br /></div><br /><br />and adding <br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.bank 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.org $8000<br /></div>
<br />
<br />before "start"-label. So now the vectors (NMI, reset and IRQ) are at the end (really not a part of the header as I though), now I need to know how to handle the banking with DASM/TASM. 
<br />
<br />Thanks for your patience, soon this is over <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> .

<br />I'm not familiar with DASM/TASM, but most assemblers do not need this explicit bank configuration NESASM does...
<br />
<br />It could be as simple as this:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;;HEADER HERE<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.org $8000<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;PRORAM HERE<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.org $FFFA<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;VECTORS HERE</div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Remember the iNES header has nothing to do with the NES itself, the ROM might be perfect as it is.  Only the emulator will use the header, and if it says there's 1 PRG bank and your code origin is at $8000 as it in the posted code, the emulator isn't going to see the vectors, it might only see the first 16kB ($8000-$BFFF) no matter how big the ROM is.  If you put stuff in the ROM, then load it an emulator like FCEU and use the memory viewer, you will be able to see what the CPU sees to verify what's happening.
<br />
<br />The 16kB PRG size bank is simply what the iNES emulator went with.  Turns out there's only one game that uses an 8kB PRG-ROM (AFAIK), Galaxian.  So it's arbitrary but works for most stuff.
<br />
<br />edit: I should also clarify that what NESASM calls banks is unique to NESASM and is unrelated to mapper banks, and iNES bank numbers.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Memblers has a point. There seems to be an inconsistency regarding the ROM size. If your code goes from $8000 to $FFFF, that means you have 32KB of PRG-ROM, which means that the PRG-ROM count field in the header should be 2 (for 2 16KB banks).

<br />
<br />It was exactly that, 32KB ROM, code was longer than 16KB, just changed offset 4 of the header from 1 to 2, works now, perfectly !
<br />
<br />A LOT of thanks of your patience and tips in solving this !!!
