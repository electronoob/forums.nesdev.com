If so, you can get rid of the warning doing <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">/SAFESEH:NO</tt>, or (from what I can determine) you have to register a safe exception handler within the code itself using <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.safesh</tt> or other methodologies.  Exception handlers... *sighing, shaking head*<br /><br /><tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">C4996: &#39;strcpy&#39;: This function or variable may be unsafe.

The <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">_s</tt> suffix is supposed to indicate &quot;secure&quot;.  <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">strncpy&#40;&#41;</tt> (which is what I'd have used) doesn't alleviate this on Windows either.  The solution is to use <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">strcpy_s&#40;&#41;</tt> and for the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">numberOfElements</tt> field, determine what the size should be (through review of the code; they could be hard-coded values, or if for literal string space you might be able to use <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">sizeof&#40;&#41;</tt> or <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">strlen&#40;&#41;</tt> in some cases).<br /><br />The reason you might see these while thefox doesn't could be explained in compiler version differences (ex. one of you using a different compiler suite than the other), or possibly some global linker settings (for the former issue) or compiler flags.<br /><br />I'll just throw in here that concern/care about warnings is *highly* justified.  Some of the worst advice I was ever given when I was learning C back in the late 90s was &quot;ah, just ignore them&quot; (warnings) -- and I'm very glad, still to this day, that I ignored that advice.  (Please do not let this paragraph become a focal point of the thread.)

Anyway, as was said, you can get rid of the first one by disabling &quot;safe SEH&quot; in the project properties, and the second one by adding _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS in the compiler's preprocessor definitions (again, in project properties).

Other parts in ThisDLL look OK I guess, the filename is there, so it's definitely locating the files, just not using it.  Fails on the first one it tries to load.

Maybe it's a version mismatch like the DbgOut is suggesting.<br /><br />EDIT: Stepping into the DLL might not be able to show you the source if you haven't compiled the mappers in the same solution. You might want to check the value of CurrentMapperInterface in interface.h of your mapper, and the same in MapperInterface.h of Nintendulator. They should match.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks, I now can compile and run!  Took a bit of time to get the right VS with the right WIN with the right DIRECTX. (FYI, I'm using VS2013 premium on Win7 Professional SP1, DirectX 11)<br /><br />However, I immediately ran across a mapper problem.  It couldn't find the mapper file.  <br /><br />Although I have minimal practice in cpp, I managed to decode the source flow to determine that the app wants the mapper file in the &quot;...msvc71\Debug (ANSI)&quot; directory; so,....I put it there!<br /><br />But now I get the error message that says &quot;mapper interface incompatible&quot;.  This seems kind of strange, as it is the same mapper file that is used by the executable.  So, either I have a mapper app mismatch to the source code, or a source code mismatch to the mapper app...or there's dumb something I'm missing.<br /><br />Any ideas?  (Just point me, I'll do the work!)<br /><br />Thanks<br />Charlie
