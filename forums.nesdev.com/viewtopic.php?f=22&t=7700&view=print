<br />As for my <em>Yars Revenge</em> game, I have lots of open tickets in my trac system.  I've begun focusing on clearing out the smaller / faster to implement tickets.  But I fear that I have way too much work to get done before the 2011 minigame compo final deadline (June 1, 2011).

<br />
<br />Snow Battle (working title)
<br />
<br />Need:
<br />-Characters dressed for the winter in picking up, stacking, throwing, running, sliding poses.  Can be human or animal.
<br />
<br />Can contribute:
<br />-Animation code
<br />-Running/Jumping code
<br />
<br />Here's a scrapped project to show that.  Run with B, slide with down.  Jump and hold back to reduce jumping distance.  Try to jump facing the other direction.  For an easter egg, change the byte at $070D to 1 and use left or right to see a dumb scrolling engine at work.
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.qfpost.com/download.do?get=b2c01a6bc7df863e17795c357d9f62a5">http://www.qfpost.com/download.do?get=b ... 357d9f62a5</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />
<br />-Graphics engine - I'm almost done with an engine that is two screens wide and can scroll indefinitely up or down.  (So this is not dumb unlike the scrapped project).  Attribute table rendering with no artifacts on ntsc included.
<br />
<br />What needs to be coded:
<br />-Hit detection with characters and playfield
<br />-Slope physics
<br />-Throwing, pushing and other mechanics
<br />-Sound engine
<br />
<br />Should have a prototype then.

<br /><strong>Can Help with</strong>
<br />-I can give a advertisement (of your game) after game credits.
<br />-I'm always full of ideas for puzzles in adventure games(like,pick\use item on smb)So if anyone need-let me know:)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />cartlemmy, I just looked back at your op and noticed you need sound fx.  I made 4 sounds in this famitracker module a while back.
<br />
<br />-the first clapping sound is supposed to be a switch flipping
<br />-the sudden burst thing is a mechanism quickly going off; this is supposed to play when things fire out of the wall (inspired by Kracko from Kirby's Dreamland)
<br />-the next two were attempts at jumping sound effects; they sound fine but are better for shooting bullets and maybe a cutesy robot noise

<br />My entry will have to wait for next year but I'd consider taking up the challenge of making sndfx from someone else's ideas.

<br />I am aware of Atari's dumb-ass reboot.  For the record, I began coding on mine November 2, 2010 (I have SVN logs to prove this).  Atari announced their version on Nov 12, 2010.
<br />
<br />There is a chance, a bit of a long-shot, that Atari can be negotiated with.  They aren't as asinine as Sony or Nintendo.  At this time, I don't know what I'm going to do.  My game probably won't be finished in enough time to enter it into the minigame compo (which is why I started it to begin with, oh well).  I'd rather have a complete, polished game than a pile of poop.
<br />
<br />So until I can talk with Atari, they send me a C+D or I "finish" the game, I probably won't change anything.  If I am forced to, I can change the art assets, trademarked names and such in a day.
<br />
<br />Are you worried that my project might bring their wrath upon our forums, and you personally for running the nesdev web server?  If so, let's talk.  I don't want to cause any trouble for anyone else.
