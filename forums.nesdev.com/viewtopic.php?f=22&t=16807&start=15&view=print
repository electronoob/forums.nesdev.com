		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A (well, potentially) more dynamic approach somewhere in between those two would be to have a few metasprite objects set to different sizes. <br /><br />Just winging an example:<br />2 4x4 sprites<br />6 2x2 sprites<br />8 objects, 56 sprites. These are field coverage as if they were bg tiles (mostly?). I think aligning them to a grid would help. <br /><br />lastly, a number of (low-priority?) stand-alone sprites<br />8 objects, 8 sprites: <br />These are for details with higher colour fidelity or where the background and/or field coverage objects are too clumsy. <br /><br />Get both some block coverage and details; update 16 objects between frames. <br />Avoids a very squarey block looking more colourful. <br /><br />Wether to go 8x8 or 8x16, i guess it is a coverage vs complexity balance. <br />8x16 could either mean larger fields, more details, or something in-between.<br /><br />I think the bg layer would need to be calculated as if there was no sprite overlay, so it never looks glitchy when sprites get choked by the scanline limit. Then sprites would be applied to fields where the posterization has been the most severe compared to the original frame.

The tradeoff is totally worth it, especially on busy moving scenes or even full screen animation/video.

Interestingly enough, (American) NES is metric pitch, and Japanese Famicom is English/standard (2.54mm pitch).  Perhaps it has something to do with the custom design nature of the NES's ZIF connector, where as the famicom used off the shelf 'standardized' female edge connectors.
