		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys, I'm asking this question here because my motivation for most of this aligns with the extra-terrestrial powers of the Super Nintendo...<br /><br />I am planning on getting very serious with all electronics. Before, I had been frustrated trying to do SMD components with my cheap-o Radio Shack Iron. I look forward to gaining experience in all levels of electronics: PCB fabrication, Eagle CAD, component salvaging, modifications, etc. <br /><br />The latest aspiration I have is to create an Eprom Emulator for SNES boards.. Anyway, I was wondering, I definitely want to make some serious upgrades Electronics wise. <br /><br />And this is a list I have so far:<br /><br />PanaVise 324 Electronic Work Center - <br /><br />Akro-Mils 10144 44 D 20-Inch by 16-Inch by 6-1/2-Inch Hardware and Craft Cabinet, Black<br /><br />Aven 17542 Desoldering Wick, 2.5mm Width, 5' Length<br /><br />4 IN 1 &quot;X-TRONIC&quot; MODEL #9020-XTS HOT AIR REWORK &amp; SOLDERING IRON STATION, FUME EXTRACTOR &amp; VACUUM PICKUP TOOL - 5 Hot Air Nozzles - 10 Asst. Solder Tips - 1 Extra Hot Air &amp; Soldering Iron Heating Element - Pinpoint Tweezers - 1 5X MAGNIFYING LAMP!!!<br /><br />Hakko Tip Cleaner, 599B-02, Non-Corrosive, No Water Needed<br /><br />Anytime Tools 127 pc Heat Shrink Wire Wrap Cable Sleeve Tubing Sets Assorted Size e/Case<br /><br />Bausch &amp; Lomb Watchmaker Loupe, 10x <br /><br />The most concern I have is over the Solder Rework Station. I'm definitely looking for a quality Soldering Iron and Hot Air, it appears it will solve any problems I can think of encountering in the line of duty.<br />What do you think?<br /><br />Do you have any recommendations for soldering iron / Hot Air. And is Combo a good way to go? <br /><br />Any other recommendations for me??<br /><br />I hope/plan to put up a Kickstarter Project to help me get going.

In addition to the tip that came with it, I also purchased the T18-I and the T18-C3 tips, and it's been great.  Can't help you for a rework station, I use ChipQuik, and it's great.  Only downside is it's consumable, like desoldering braid, so once I run out, I'll probably be looking at hot-air rework stations myself.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />yeah, Hakko is the way to go. It's got great reviews all around, and not just from here.<br /><br />However, I hear the digital controls on it are unintuitive, and that the analog is easier. If I gave up the ability to see the temperature display, I could save $20 and not worry about controlling its oddness.<br /><br />What do you 2, who own the Hakko, think about it?

Anything even remotely obvious helps, since most of this is new to me (I have been working with 1 tip for several years)</div><br />The T18-I is a super-fine conical tip that I like to use for small SMD work (mostly discrete components like SMD resistors/capacitors/LEDs/etc), and also sometimes for through-hole parts when the parts are tightly packed.  If you've been using the same tip for years, you'll probably really come to appreciate the fine tip when you need it.  The T18-C3 is for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUyetZ5RtPs" class="postlink">drag soldering SMD ICs</a>.  The medium chisel tip that comes with the iron works great for general through-hole work, and honestly, between those 3 tips, I can solder basically anything short of QFN/BGA.<br /><br />As for the discussion of the analog vs digital temperature controls, I'd say go for the analog, only for the reason that you can probably get it a bit cheaper, and as has been said, you'll probably just set the temp once and leave it, so the digital controls don't really give you anything special.  The analog controls have a hex nut on them that you can tighten down and lock the temperature, which is nice.<br /><br />I have nothing but good things to say about the 888, and I've only ever heard good things everywhere I looked when I was first shopping for it, so whether you go analog or digital on the temperature controls, it's a solid iron, and a reasonable price.
