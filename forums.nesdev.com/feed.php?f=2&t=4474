This is the kind of explanation I would like to find. What I don't know is if those words are common or not.<br /><br />Another example is you have a timer and a length counter.

I find it more logical to have "virtual" registers that actually stores data that is relevant for the music engine (for example duty cycle, volume, etc...) and then another routine that combines them and place them into actual sound registers (for example $4000 registers have both duty cycle and volume information into it).<br />Copy the volume and duty cycle into another variable and then copy that variable on the register in not a necessary step.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Oct 20, 2008 10:57 pm</p><hr />

Now I have a few things I want to confirm when restoring the APU status and it this part is working fine, then the sound driver update is now finished.<br /><br />Thanks again for this sample, it helped me pinpointing my error <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Mon Oct 20, 2008 10:25 pm</p><hr />

Just writing a tracker+sound driver is quite a demanding task.<br /><br />My point is right now there is no easy, everybody can use, sound driver available.  By hacking this sound driver and adding the extra functionality for games (dynamic address for data location + sound fx playing), people will be able to make music with the tracker and quickly insert it in their game. They won't need anymore to hack some nsf file to do this job.  <br /><br />I hope this will increase the amount of new nes demo/games made by beginner's nes developer.  For me, it doesn't bring anything back, just the feeling that I helped a few new developers and I brought something interesting to the community.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The day I'll write larger NES games or games for other platforms I'll be sure to use my own engine in all cases. Personally I love writing music engines, I find it very entertaining and rewarding. There is other things I don't like writing (who said AI for enemies ?) and noone come with pre-made engines for them <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /></div><br /><br />Great that you like making sound engines. If you have time, I want you to teach me the basics on how to use the sound registers to make good sound effects <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  I'm sure it would contribute to many new programmers too.<br /><br />For the AI... I think this is something that you don't have any choice to make yourself since it's not related to the hardware. But maybe some basic AI like terminator style or other could be made generic for the nes, who knows.  I have to start to work on those soon.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Celius wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />If your engine can really do whatever it needs to do without using virtual registers, then great. That's the case, right?<br /></div><br /><br />At the moment, yes, you don't even need to know what the player does: you just tell the driver to not play sound on X channel and it will stop it. Then once you're finished, you just re-enable that channel.  Very simple.  <br /><br />Now I must find a way to make good sound fx samples to make sure that the driver and my updated code is working 100% but this is where I have issues right now.  I need to figure out how to time properly my soundfx. If I could find a sample of a few fx, that would already help me. I would learn a lot from that.  I don't think there is any on the nesdev front page?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Celius wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Also, virtual sound registers may not necessarily hold what's being played. They could hold the values of what was being played before it was updated. This might be handy to some people.<br /></div><br /><br />Since famitracker does have a lot of variable for pre-processing, I guess this information is already available if you know where to look for. The only problem is that the code was lightly documented since it was never planed to be used for game like I'm trying to do.   But after a little bit of research, you could find it. So I guess the virtual registers are not necessary actually.<br /><br />Compared to your engine with use only 96 byte, the famitracker one is bigger but there is one reason: it has to cover as many case as possible because of the tracker interface. And since it was never planned for games, I don't think the amount of memory used was an issue.  There is good chance it could be optimized.<br /><br />Good then once my tests are finished with proper sound fx samples then I can release the driver for everybody. I may port it to wla or other assembler, if some people wants it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Mon Oct 20, 2008 5:47 pm</p><hr />
