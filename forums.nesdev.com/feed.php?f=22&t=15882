The editor is mostly functional, however I stopped development for a little bit...

It looks very unfinished now but that's because there are some bugs on the specific PCE code, I converted the graphics as-is and threw an ugly yellow palette at everything, and I dummied out my RLE decompression and sprite functions for now. Aside from that, it's working pretty well!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5877">Punch</a> — Tue Apr 03, 2018 11:38 am</p><hr />

That's the model I was going to use but decided against it, yeah, but actually (and I'm quite embarassed to admit) I didn't know about bitpacking.

As I said before it's too cumbersome to import the Aseprite bmp into NES Screen Tool, only to have to carefully select columns of tiles from the tilemap and export one by one through the &quot;copy asm to clipboard&quot; option. In fact if it were just for the dungeon editor I could just use Excel and a script to convert csv to bin.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5877">Punch</a> — Fri Jan 26, 2018 7:16 pm</p><hr />

Just when I was going to finish up my dungeon editor my laptop keyboard stopped working properly. A Russian OEM keyboard is coming from China as we speak now <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />Anyway... most of the work on the game this week was on defining how maps and pre-built wall assets are represented in ROM, as well as writing tools so I don't have to deal with the weirdest pipeline of Aseprite -&gt; .bmp -&gt; NESST import -&gt; Export manual selections to ASM -&gt; Pasting and labeling uncompressed data.<br /><br />How am I gonna encode the levels? If I simply do a 16x16 array I'll have 256 bytes per map, which can be reduced if I represent each cell ID with 2 bits (I'll probably won't be able to fit more than 3 different wall types on 256 characters anyway...), giving us 256/4 = 64 bytes per map. If I need more distinct tile types I could just double the ID size and get 128 bytes per map, 16 different wall types (which I'll probably need since I'll use 2 different IDs to represent door cells in the north/south and east/west direction). For specific indicators (door locked/open, event trigger, treasure chest, etc.) I could simply do a second 16x16 array with RLE compression to indicate which cell does what, the RLE compression would work well since I imagine most cells would have ID 00 (aka just your usual floor/wall). <sub>edit: I was considering representing the mazes&#39; walls by the grid lines instead of whole cells &#40;like DDS&#41; but I feel like it&#39;s not the best approach here.</sub><br /><br /><br />16x16 seems satisfactory enough but I wonder how Digital Devil Story 1 has such large maps, with doors, warps, items, events, special tiles...

Too bad. Guess I'll just use the plain look for now.<br /><br />Edit2: Change of plans... I'll probably make Bank 1 the minimap + status bar + dungeon display graphics and use Bank 2 for the full text character table + sprites. Since I'm only displaying text on the bottom of the screen (the status bar shows stuff too but I'll change that soon) I'll just rely on Spr0 interrupt to swap banks, just like Pool of Radiance. (I wish my game could be as pretty as that one). Is there a UNROM like cartridge with bankswitchable Character ROM? That would be handy.<br /><br />My test wall leaves as much as 90 characters free but I chose to use only 64 characters for the sidebar. I'll probably remove all text and leave only the needed characters for truncated indicators (HP DEF MAP), the symbols for the minimap and numbers 0-9. This makes dungeon graphics significantly less limited than the scheme I was using which allowed only for 128 chars. I'm arranging my wall renderings in a 256x240 bitmap with aesprite so I can just import it into shiru's NESST to get a character table without redundant tiles. It's a pain in the butt but I don't feel like writing tools for this right now <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />This is the wall graphics I've made (WIP):<br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VSIJL24.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />As you can see the palette is quite nice, which by the way was a fatal mistake, it's hard to make it look that good on the actual NES palette... It looks ok if I use the two darkest grays (as it is intended to be a concrete wall) or gray + dark green for the highlight color which makes it look like a wall with moss/sludge (don't know the exact word).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5877">Punch</a> — Sat Nov 18, 2017 1:34 pm</p><hr />

Wow this looks amazing ! I've been missing this so far because I don't look into the compo forums. I think it's probably a better usage of raycasting than a first-person shooter game, since<br /><br />1) I don't personally like fist person shooters<br />2) It would be too slow for an action game anyway.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Nov 04, 2017 1:49 am</p><hr />
