		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You're using the term &quot;user&quot;, which to me means &quot;account&quot;.  Otherwise the term being used makes no sense to me.<br /><br />If you're talking about on Windows -- <strong>no, this is not the responsibility of a <span style="text-decoration: underline">program</span>.</strong>  If you want a separate user, you should create a separate account/user on the Windows machine.  You can configure two accounts to be part of the same &quot;group&quot; (ex. Power Users, Snake Biters, Dog Meat Men, whatever you call it) and then set permissions on the Nestopia binary and related folders/etc. so that they're accessible (read/write/executable) by anyone in that group.  You'd then adjust the nestopia.ini file to point all the paths/etc. to a folder accessible (read/write) to that group, so either account X or account Y could access those saves, ROMs, or whatever else you want.<br /><br /><strong>This is done at the Windows and filesystem level.</strong>  There are guides/walkthroughs all over the web on how to do this, and no I will not go looking for a bunch to link here.  It's part of Windows system administration (if there even is such a thing ;-) ) but it's how you do it properly.

What's done to a copy will not interfere with the other. Or do what koitsu said and work with actual Windows accounts. Personally, I hate messing with that stuff.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />FWIW, I also hate messing with that stuff -- I still to this day believe in every way/shape/form that Windows is a single-user desktop OS, and that all -- I repeat, ALL -- attempts Microsoft has made to make it multi-user are just utter and complete failures.  I guess that's also why when I see people hemming and hawing over the implications of &quot;the security model on XP/Vista/7/8&quot; and how account X can access account Y's stuff through some exploit, I'm just like &quot;who gives a sh**, the OS was never made for this crap, use some *IX OS if you want such&quot;.  ;-)<br /><br />But in ouso1999's case, given that he's already talking about &quot;users&quot;, I'm left thinking that what he really does want is a separate Windows user/account.  Because otherwise I have no idea what &quot;enabling me to have a special user with its own saved games&quot; would mean/imply.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Perhaps what someone wants is one of these:<br /><ul><li>Ability to select one of several .sav files for a single game, like the PowerPak can. This would be useful for my NES graphics editor even without multiple users. </li><li>Ability to create a user account without the 15 minutes of &quot;one moment please&quot; text on a slowly color-changing background that Windows 8 imposes. </li><li>Ability to create sub-accounts of your own user account if nobody in the sudoers/administrators group happens to be home at the time. This has happened in my aunt's household when someone couldn't create an account for a house guest because the PC's administrator was spending the day with the other (joint custodial) parent. Treating user accounts as a tree (making &quot;root&quot; actually meaningful) would solve this. </li></ul>

So, different Nestopia accounts means separated savestates and stuff. Got it? Heck, it's NOT a matter of two (or more) instances of the program<em>!</em><br /><br />Absolutely great idea if you ask me.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Nestopia's settings are stored in nestopia.ini, the path of which is always the path where the nestopia.exe executable is (i.e. if D:\snakes\nestopia\nestopia.exe, there will be D:\snakes\nestopia\nestopia.ini).<br /><br />This is what's colloquially called a &quot;portable application&quot;.<br /><br />Sometimes &quot;portable apps&quot; are also advertised as &quot;U3 compatible&quot;, which is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U3" class="postlink">Sandisk-proprietary software thing</a> that lets you stick a U3-compatible program on a USB flash drive/memory stick and it runs completely off that.  I detest U3 -- you don't need installed software to accomplish portability.<br /><br />I absolutely detest %APPDATA% (which is what people are talking about above, re: &quot;home directory&quot; equivalent on Windows) and/or %USERPROFILE% and/or %HOMEPATH%.  This is mainly because my entire workstation is designed so that I can format C: at any moment/on a whim and lose almost nothing application-wise (only things I'd lose are my PuTTY sessions settings (stored in registry) and my Firefox bookmarks (stored balls deep within %APPDATA%) and I have scripts/methods to back both of those up in advance).  %APPDATA% is a complete/total crap repository in most cases, and I love finding programs that dump all sorts of garbage there that never gets cleaned up.  I <strong>really</strong> like portable apps (I drop them on my D: drive in their own directory and use them until the cows come home (moo)).<br /><br />So if someone's going to code this change, please at least make it so that if a nestopia.ini is found in the same directory as nestopia.exe, it operates in &quot;portable app mode&quot; (how it operates today), otherwise can use %APPDATA%.  This is how many programs today support both methods (MPC-HC**, uTorrent, KeePass, etc.).<br /><br />** =  They actually have a completely broken/hilarious design for this: there is a GUI checkbox to enable/disable storing settings in an .ini (vs. registry; default is registry).  Think about why this is broken -- it means that out of the box it uses the registry, but then if you check the checkbox, it begins saving to .ini (you have to exit/restart the app), but then leaves leftover cruft/settings in the registry that it isn't even using any more EXCEPT for that one setting in the registry which needs to remain so that it can determine if it should use the registry or an .ini file.  ;D  &quot;We really thought this out well...&quot;  Or they could just do away with the idiocy and do a file-exists test for mpc-hc.ini in the same directory as mpc-hc.exe and if it's there use it.  *gasp*

One problem with Windows though is that back in the Win95 days there was no need to have separate data for each user, and FAT32 didn't support file rights, so applications stored the data wherever they wanted and that has been carried over to many applications today. Fortunately most Windows apps nowadays are aware of AppData and friends.
