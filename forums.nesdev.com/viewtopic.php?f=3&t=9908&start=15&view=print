I guess we also need to have the emulators use 100% CPU on a few cores to simulate the ~90 watts a TV used.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For me the trouble with emulators and even flash carts is that it's too easy to load a different rom when you get the slightest bit bored.  With the actual console you're naturally lazy and when you start to get slightly bored it's the hassle of getting up to swap out carts and get the actual game to boot and everything.  That little bit of effort is what keeps me glued to a single game for much longer than I should be, just because I want to give it one more try before giving up and looking for another game.<br /><br />Not sure there is really a good way to implement that into an emulator without upsetting the user, but that's the big ticket for me.<br /><br />The other issue that often frustrates me is timing delays between the controller and the emulator.  I thought Shiru's Lawn-mower was super challenging to get the timing exactly right until I played in on an actual NES and realized the delay is what was killing me.  Perhaps some time trickery on behalf of the emulator would help with that.  Time travel is challenging though...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Concerning the FDS-sound, this is something I actually emulated (well, sort of) in my old emulator A/NES for AmigaOS.<br />If the user inserted a 3.5&quot; floppy into the Amigadrive when booting an FDS-game, the reading sound was emulated by instead<br />reading the 3.5&quot; disk. I translated the byteoffset read into a sectoroffset and made the diskdrive make a &quot;dummyread&quot; just to get<br />a sound of the drive..

You have to press the reset button for an incredibly long time (else it will just reset the game) and then you'll have to navigate trough the awkward menu interface to load a different ROM. It's definitely more effort than switching to another cart. This isn't true any longer for the SNES power pak thanks to the guy with the lion avatar who I forgot his name, but unfortunately this is how it goes with the NES power pak.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The problem is that the FDS drive noise isn't part of the signal path, meaning the TV's volume control has no effect on it. There isn't really a way to reference the PC's output level to an absolute sound output power</div><br />Actually, it's a good thing it would get mixed with the volume of the PC, because if you ever want to play emulation while being totally silent you should be able to.<br />Ideally the emulator could optionally enable or disable the noise, and if enabled he could chose the volume relative to the other channels. By default the noise would be enabled and be quieter than the actual sound channel.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ha ha, I always hated when emulators for Amiga or Atari ST play a recording of the drive sound. I fondly remember the noise, but I don't find the recording really pushes the nostalgia button for me. It just sounds like a recording. Maybe if there was some sort of USB buzzing box I could attach... but this is not something I'd spend money on.<br /><br />Also I don't miss long load times and disk swapping at all. I usually fast forward the load bits anyway.

A similar thing occurs when one's financial situation for the first time gives plenty of extra money to spend on games and one buys several games at a time.
