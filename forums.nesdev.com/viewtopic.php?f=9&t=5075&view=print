		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, folks.  Late last year, I started playing around with my cheap video digitizer (Composite/S-Video) to get it to capture RGB output from my game systems.  I did this by stripping the sync signals from the comp+sync line, and joining it with one of the R, G, B, components, and capturing each component one-by-one.  The resulting capture is quite nice:

<br />
<br />However, as we know, the colours are a bit off from the regular NTSC NES' PPU.  I checked the brightness of the grey levels of the RGB PPU and compared them with the results Kevtris posted in <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=2113" class="postlink">this thread</a>.  Here's what I plotted, quickly:
<br /><img src="http://www.disgruntleddesigner.com/chrisc/images/RGBChart1.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Simply, even though pure white and pure black are bright and dark enough, respectively, the colours (greys, for now) in the middle are too bright.  What I want to know is if there is a way (through electronic components) to lower the dark tones, and maybe the midtones, but keep the brightness at its maximum (ie: like a gamma correction), kinda with a curve like this:
<br /><img src="http://www.disgruntleddesigner.com/chrisc/images/RGBChart3.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Either one of the purple lines would be what I want to achieve.
<br />
<br />As far as I understand, simply adding resistors lowers the overall brightness:

<br />
<br />So, any ideas?

<br />
<br />A digital filter would be conceptually simple (output = curve(input)), but I doubt it could be worth the hardware cost and additional quantization error.
<br />
<br />An analog wizard could probably whip up something similar... I guess it would involve clamping, clipping and biasing the signal into two levels; the low level gets attenuated linearly (or on a curve with a custom amplifier) and then summed with the unaltered high level.

<br />
<br />edit: changing my monitors gamma DOES seem to change the picture. (so it looks more like the one on the left before changing gamma.

<br />
<br />Hmm, you'd need some kind of amplifier with a curve on it.  This will most likely require some op-amps and other fun things.  A log amp is the first place I'd look.
<br />
<br />Something like this:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_amplifier">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_amplifier</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Other than that, it's going to be pretty difficult I think.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Couldn't it just as easily be that the digitizer is clamping the highest levels so that they match exactly? Seems it'd be best to first do it in software with the digitized images, then consider making an analog version of it (though I don't know what you'd gain).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the comments.  Yes, it's possible that the digitizer is clamping the white levels, but on my RGB monitor, white on my FC Titler is a little bit dark, compared to RGB from my SNES, Saturn, Neo-Geo, etc.  I first was going to replace the resistors I put in the FC with something weaker, to boost the white for my RGB monitor, but when I checked the brightnesses of the other colours, I gave up, because the mid- and low tones are too bright too.
<br />
<br />I'll have to be happy with the regular output of my FC Titler, then, and just turn down the contrast knob on the monitor.
