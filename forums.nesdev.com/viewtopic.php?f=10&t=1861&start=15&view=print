<br />Then they can manually resize Nintendulator's main window to something like 100*100, instead of using the menu.

<br />My brother recently had a problem with the video card in his Pentium IV, so I lent him an old 1MB card from my old 100Mhz Pentium I, so that he houldn't be without a computer. It worked fine, Windows XP and all. Maybe this is okcomputer's case? If that's so, it should be temporary.
<br />
<br />Anyway, there are other cases when 1024x768 is not a good option. My girlfriend's PC uses a cheaper smaller monitor, that can only handle 1024x768 with a refresh rate of 60Hz. I don't know about you guys, but I find 60Hz pretty unusable, it hurts my eyes.
<br />
<br />Now, Quietust, I'm not too fond of the layout in Nintendulator's debug mode myself (can't use it at my gf's house or on a low-end notebook), but I'm not asking you to do anything about it, after all, it's your tool and you can make it however you want. Anyone can choose not to use something if they don't like it.

<br />The NES itself runs at 60 Hz. If the NES hurts your eyes, then why are you posting on a board dedicated to it?

<br />For some reason, a TV @ 60Hz is not as annoying as a PC monitor @ 60 Hz (maybe it is, if I sit too close to it). I don't know why 'cause I'm not a hardware guru, but there obviously is a difference between both technologies.
<br />
<br />Are you telling that a regular CRT monitor at 60 Hz does not bother you? Nah... forget it. I'm not in the mood for that right now.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you display mostly-white images on a TV, the flicker is more apparent. TV images usually don't have lots of really bright areas, unlike most "images" that appear on a PC monitor (that is, images of your desktop and open windows). One also usually sits closer to a PC monitor so it covers a wider field of vision, particularly the peripheral areas where there are more movement (i.e. flicker) detectors in the eye.
<br />
<br />Personally, 60 Hz is not pleasant on a CRT monitor unless the computer is displaying something that would look OK on a TV, like an emulator running full-screen.

<br />So if the debugger were white on a black background, would it be any easier on the eyes? Setting your Windows system colors appropriately and then improving Nintendulator to work with those colors instead of hardcoded colors might help.

<br />Nintendulator already uses the system default colors for the debugger and register windows, except for breakpoints and the "current instruction" lines, which it now does (using the 'highlight' foreground/background and 'window frame' colors, respectively).
