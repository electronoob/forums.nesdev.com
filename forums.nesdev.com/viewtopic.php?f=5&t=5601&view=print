		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well over a year ago I found some old NES games at my mother in law's house. Cleaned them up, and now they work great (on my own NES, which is still in great shape). Just obtained a NES from her house, too. I got a 72 pin connector, perhaps prematurely, to refurbish it. The darn thing can't even get power. The power connector itself looks very corroded. So...is this a lost case or do you think I could resuscitate it by switching out the power connector (somehow..?).  I'm considering just tearing out the hardware and turning it into an emulation PC if it really is broken.

More exact replacements can be got online, I forget the exact size. You can try to remove the rust with sos, sandpaper or whatever you might get it going that way.

<br />What would you suggest I try if I were to obtain a multimeter?
<br />
<br />The only electronics experience I have is a bit of soldering/desoldering. If I could learn a bit about how to test what component is bad, I'm pretty certain I could go from that to actually fixing this NES.

<br />1- (testable by swapping with another NES) Does the wall transformer work?

<br />I used the same AC adapter on this NES as with my working NES, so that rules out #1. It looks like if I could obtain a multimeter, I should try 2 and 3. Could you point me to a good online resource for the proper way to use a multimeter? What would I be looking for... "life?" or a specific voltage?

<br />
<br />If you look at the regulator there will be 3 pins, there's an input, ground, and output.  The output should be somewhere close to 5V DC.  Also, visually inspect the electrolytic capacitors and make sure they didn't blow up.  Though the NES seems fairly resistant to power supply problems.  It'll run with almost any AC adapter that fits the plug, AC or DC output regardless of polarity.

Also the FC clone's capacitor had suffered catastrophic failure (exploded confetti all over the inside of the case).  But those were both caused by reversed-polarity on the power supply, and the NES is protected from that.

CAREFULLY place one line on the pin farthest to the right, looking from the front (the side with all the labels and the philips screw head visible), and the other side against the heatsink (big metal thing it's screwed into).
<br />
<br />Using the ghetto method (headpoones) to test it, you'd place the tip on the far-right pin, and the base on the headsink. A speaker on the heaphones should make a scratching noise.
<br />
<br />Of couse in any testing, if you short the right pin and the heatsink directly, you pretty much fried the vreg...Thankfully they're somewhat readily available from rat shack.
