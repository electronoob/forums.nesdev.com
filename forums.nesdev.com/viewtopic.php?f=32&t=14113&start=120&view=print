As long as we're making the games and hammering out the details, I feel like we're making progress. I'd be more concerned if nobody was asking for clarifications, especially with a lot of newer users wanting to enter. (Like me! Still three months from coding for NES for a year)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From what I recall last time the requirement last compo was &lt;=64KB and compatible with mapper 28.  All category 1 entries choose to utilize NROM. I figured we'd keep with that and not limit people to NROM and CHR-ROM.  The 8-32KB of chr-ram available on the cartridge would be available to anyone who chose to make use of the available hardware.  If collectively we feel that last compo's requirements were too confusing and we are better off to strictly limit to NROM that's fine, I'm just curious If there is other logic behind that thought.<br /><br />From a multi game menu creation use of chr-ram by entries would make the multi rom creation simpler, perhaps it's not that significant though.  We would need Tepples input if from his past efforts.

Where the original game switched CHR ROM pages, the UNROM version would switch to bank 0 or 1, blank the screen, decompress one of the game's four 8K pattern table pages to CHR RAM, and switch bank to bank 2 where the code was. This effort also exposed and corrected stack overflow bugs in the movement code.<br /><br />But if a compelling CNROM game uses rapid CHR bank switching, I could add CNROM support to the builder.

It does not switch rapidly CHR-ROM with the screen on, so a CHR-RAM conversion would be possible and the game would take even less space, as there is significant repeat between the CHR-ROM banks.

I volunteered, eventually got the website up, maintain the email account, and organize the voting etc.  InfiniteNESLives volunteered his time and services with the creation of the cartridges, managing the financial aspect of the competition, and general organizing.  Tepples has combined the previous entries for the multi-carts.<br /><br />Other people have also helped in the past, in one way or another.  The unique thing about this contest is that pretty much anyone who wants to help can. There was help with label artwork/manuals, and in the first competition we had a panel of judges, and of course any and all suggestions are always considered.  For the most part people haven't had a whole lot of suggestions in the past, so having a couple of main organizers making the final decisions seemed to help.

I try my best to make organize everything based on input from the forum.  Best way I've found thus far is to post plans publicly prior to making final decisions.  Sometimes it's consensus by crickets, other times a wide spectrum of input is received and we try to appeal to the masses as best we can.  Everyone's input and comments are welcome and valued.
