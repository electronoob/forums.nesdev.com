		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd like to someone write such thing. We have plenty of ASM tuts, but every NES-specific cc65 tutorial I found usually ends on Hello World program.
<br />
<br />Now, I have nothing against SOME (by "some" I mean "very little") assembly in places where it is needed, but full assembly coding is hard for most people. No IFs, instead of using variables with simple names, we have to operate directly on registers, etc.
<br />
<br />So I ask you (especially people who did things with cc65 in the past) to write more advanced tutorial for writing game with cc65. The tutorial would cover  all aspects of game making from making gfx and sfx to displaying sprites in game and playing sounds/music. And of course will be made with more advanced library than nes.lib, I propose KNES (which author's I PM-ed about such thing, but apparently he doesn't have time for this now).
<br />
<br />So could someone make such tut? And please refrain from posts like "LEARN 6502 ASM OMFG LOL". For dummies, a.k.a. noob programmers who barely understand C and are more happy with languages like Pascal, like me it's too hard.
<br />
<br />Don't get me wrong - I want to learn and want to make NES games (even so I can tell somebody "omg I just made NES game, see?"), and while some assembly is good, it's too hard to write all things in ASM.

You could construct some basic ones with macros, though. As for operating on registers: You can just write/find a subroutine for that, and never touch it again. My game updates tiles. I just feed it the tile numbers like you'd pass arguments to a function. The register stuff is done automagically. Like what you're looking for in C. <br /><br />Am I operating directly with SDL's internal variables when I call SDL_Init( SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING );  to initialize it? <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">For dummies, a.k.a. noob programmers who barely understand C and are more happy with languages like Pascal, like me it's too hard. </div>
<br />If you wanna make games without learning how to program, there are tools for that. (Not for NES, of course) I find assembly language easier than C in nearly every way. There's a post in your previous topic from someone else saying basically the same thing. If you are a noob programmer, learning an assembly language may really help you. 6502 assembly was easier for me to learn, I understand exactly why the code works the way it does, and it helped me understand how software really works. And yet BASIC and Visual Basic totally confuse me. They're far too abstract (especially VB. It does so much for me, I can't follow it). 
<br />
<br />Shiru already did more than most would in this regard by putting together his awesome Alter Ego package. You've also mentioned thefox's KNES. But you have rejected both. I think you will have to meet someone halfway somewhere, because I propose it would be harder to put this request together for whoever does it, than it would be for you to learn assembly language. 
<br />
<br />You sound like you want to jump behind the wheel of a car without learning how to drive. How long are you willing to wait for someone to fulfill this proposal? Is your desire to make an NES game really that great if you don't want to learn all the nitty-gritty? Why not just prototype the game in C with NES (graphical) limitations in mind, and then find an assembly language programmer? Or not even find an assembly language programmer? Just keep it Retraux like Megaman 9 and 10.
<br />
<br />I bet more of us here could program whatever game you have in mind, than could make this C dream project. It'd even be easy to make a set of subroutines wrappers for dealing with the NES registers (PPU registers, reading joypad, etc.). Even if someone does create this, it may still be necessary for you to know assembly to debug the output when something goes wrong that you don't understand. 
<br />
<br />What's your real goal? Do you just want your game on NES, or do <em>you</em> actually have to be the one to make it? Because if you ask a programmer to remake a hypothetical C program of your game for NES, someone else is doing some of the work. If you ask a programmer to create a large set of tutorials and easy to use tools, someone else is doing some of the work. So why is it so important for you to have it the second way? (None of these are rhetorical questions. I'd actually like to know your goal here)
<br />
<br />As a random aside, check this out: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bataribasic.com/">http://bataribasic.com/</a><!-- m --> It may be your dream, except it's for Atari. (Never tried it, no idea if it's any good)

<br />
<br />That's x86, the most confusing and stupid assembly ever. 6502 is nothing like it, how about you try it first? It's pretty much the most straightforward assembly can be, it's nowhere near that bad. x86 is disgusting, you'll never find me doing that crap even.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually, I had an idea to write such a tutorial right after Alter Ego. I  improved the low-level library, and started to make an example, but ultimately lost motivation. That's because it is really major amount of work that only would help very few people - my methods aren't really suitable for newcomers (like, I don't use any IDEs; my tools aren't really comfortable, etc).
<br />
<br />Also, even with C and low-level library, you still need to learn assembly and NES hardware to some extent, to be able to solve all the kinds of problems that could arise in the process. I still don't think that C is easier to use than ASM on NES - it could simplify certain parts, but generally things aren't developed well enough, like, say, on PC, you can't just forget about low-level things. You can't even write in proper C for NES, you have to follow certain limitations to make resulting code faster (no local vars, for example).
<br />
<br />I think that some kind of an integer BASIC compiler actually would be better entry-level tool for NES, something like bAtari BASIC (Atari 2600) or BasiEgaXorz (Sega Genesis).
<br />
<br />
<br />By the way, you can structure your ASM code with macros, making it more readable. Like, make a macros set_score(n), add_score(n) that will contain needed code, and then you can just use these as a kind of a function.

<br />nbasic (by Bob Rost) has practically nothing to do with BASIC, except for the name. BasiEgaXorz etc are much closer to the "real" BASIC, and thus much easier to use.

<br />
<br />Regarding your joke on BASIC, I've said 'compiler'. The two I mentioned are compilers, not interpreters. So they aren't slow. And C on NES is not fast as well, compiled BASIC and C are pretty much comparable in this case.

As for setting a 16 bit value, that has to be done fairly rarely (at least for values other than 0 in my experience). One can probably write a macro for that too, but not in the assembler I use. (At least not in a way that would be preferred by you)<br /><br />I think your preconceptions are making it seem harder than it is. You can actually make assembly very easy for yourself. Let's pretend this is the only way to do things. Can you deal with it then, or will you give up? There are only 56 instructions, probably &lt;12 of which you'll use regularly. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I can always ask for help here.

<br />I also notice you answered none of my questions about why your NES game has to be done specifically this way. Give them some thought. I'm truly curious.

<br />Alot of what you learn about working with tile based graphics can then be applied in Nes C dev.

<br />Which...dare I point out...technically isn't an <strong>I</strong>DE.
<br />
<br />Seriously though...there's an IDE out there that will let you step through and symbolically debug Alter Ego or any other game written in C/Assembly.  Sure...it's not perfect...but I <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><em>know</em>:shock: the author so...if there's any suggestions on how to make it more appealing/useful, I'm sure I could convince him.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />And for the record...I created an <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nesicideproject/documents/AlterEgo.rar?attredirects=0&amp;d=1" class="postlink">Alter Ego project</a> to be used with said IDE.  For the same reason already mentioned several times in these threads...it's much easier to provide a working [in this case stellarly-so] example for people to step through than to provide countless "ok now we're going to take the cake out of the oven and add frosting" build-up tutorials.

I know it requires a certain way of thinking that is rare for even other programmers, but still when you can think that way, it becomes really straightforward and simple. IMO, if you'll take the dive and just go through the first 6502 assembly tutorials, even if you learn it you can make a more educated decision of what is right for you.
