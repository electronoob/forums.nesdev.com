i would suggest you learn the asm for what ever you are programming.  if you are writing nes emulator or game, then i would suggest 6502.<br /><br />if you are writing an application to run on an x86 cpu, then i would suggest learning x86.   you can use gcc -S with c source code to show the asm <br /><br />i would not waste my time learning DOS or bios interrupt calls, those are deprecated and have no modern use.   (might i ask why you want to learn bios routines ?    i dont think windows or linux uses those at all, and i think bsd might still use 1)<br /><br />not sure i can suggest what to learn.  depends what you want to do with it.   i would suggest 6502, x86, or arm.<br /><br />matt<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=170">mattmatteh</a> — Wed Feb 25, 2009 12:59 pm</p><hr />

I'm sort of a noob here, but I do have experience with x86 assembly language. I taught myself years ago with a book by Jeff Duntemann called "Assembly Language: Step by Step." That book was a godsend. It is one of the clearest and most enjoyable programming books I've ever read. If you can get your hands on that book, and TASM or MASM, and use it on a computer with DOS (or use DosBox perhaps), I would highly recommend that. <br /><br />*edit*<br /><br />Here is the book on amazon. I have the old copy with the black cover, but this version covers doing assembly programming on linux as well as dos (same book though so I'm sure still great):<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Assembly-Language-Step-step-Programming/dp/0471375233/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1235589776&amp;sr=8-2" class="postlink">http://www.amazon.com/Assembly-Language-Step-step-Programming/dp/0471375233/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1235589776&amp;sr=8-2</a><br /><br /><br />I haven't been doing nesdev long, but I can definitely say my prior x86 experience has made it relatively easy for me to learn some of the basics. Good luck!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Wed Feb 25, 2009 12:06 pm</p><hr />

To preface this discussion, I have very limited amounts of programming experience. Some BASIC years ago, and only a very little bit of C.<br /><br />Which microprocessor architecture would some of you recommend to someone that doesn't have much experience with assembly language? I suppose the ideal platform would be one with good tools, documentation, and emulators/simulators for testing code. Some processors off the top of my head are the Z80, x86, 6502, 6509, 6512, 68000, ARM, and TMS9900.<br /><br />I would imagine for a beginner, developing on a platform with a decent amount of BIOS routines would be helpful as well. Also, a platform is easy to learn, yet difficult to master to keep it interesting would be ideal as well.<br /><br />Would any of you share your experiences and thoughts? I'm interested in both learning and having some fun as well icon_smile.gif<br /><br />Thanks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3834">Doom5</a> — Wed Feb 25, 2009 10:42 am</p><hr />
