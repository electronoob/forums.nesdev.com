I suppose that the triangle wave is there to allow doing a (very) crude imitation of those sine waves, although in practice everybody would use the square waves anyway...

At first, NES games used CHR ROM bank switching to give a separate set of tiles to each game mode. But as ROM sizes soared and mapper ICs gained smaller windows, games started to use it for tile animation. This partly made up for the smaller video memory bandwidth associated with only being able to write about 128-160 bytes to VRAM during vertical blanking. <em>Dr. Mario</em> used CHR animation to jiggle the viruses, an effect later seen in Shiru's homebrew games. <em>Cosmic Epsilon</em> even used CHR banking as a makeshift texture mapper. But before the jiggling grass and quicksand of <em>Super Mario Bros. 2: Mario Madness</em>, did any games make extensive use of CHR animation in the background, be it CHR ROM or CHR RAM?

It seems like the NES was the only console to actually use triangle waves extensively, as other consoles that could do it (C64, Game Boy) only do so on occasion.  Many C64 games use the triangle solely for triangle kicks, while not a lot of Game Boy/Color games use the triangle wave.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whBg7IF5JUg" class="postlink">Tetris theme A</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzpZTtnkX5Y" class="postlink">Wario Land 3:  Above the Clouds (Night)</a> are the only Game Boy/Color songs (that I know of) to prominently use the triangle wave.

You have two other arbitrary channels that can each be playing a bass tone while the third is using noise on the SID. On the SMS, you don't.<br /><br />Perhaps you're referring to percussion sounds made with short bursts of noise alternating with tonal sounds? Doesn't have anything specific to do with bass, but it's a common technique on SID and AY tunes. It can be done on the NES too, if you really want to, but on the NES it's not a natural solution to a hardware problem like on these other chips.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I think that despite the SID's great versatility of waveforms, its lack of effective volume control on the channels made the music much more difficult to balance than the NES, which had fairly independent volume on most channels. A great deal of SID music is blaring and loud, and few composers for it had the skill to overcome this limitation.<br /><br />A lot of FM music is in a similar boat. FM is extremely versatile, but it's very difficult and time consuming to make patches that sound beautiful and balanced together. There are some really wonderful FM game soundtracks, but the average is really rough sounding.<br /><br />Did anyone mention the Atari Pokey used in the 7800 and other Atari 8-bit computers? I'd say this chip was almost as good as the NES APU. Four channels, 4-bit volume, variable-with pulse, noise, and some other weird waveforms available. The big limitation on this one is the frequency control is only 8-bit, but otherwise it's a really capable chip. I don't think it often got used to the extent it was capable during its commercial run though.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Sik wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Also you can get a triangle wave with additive synthesis, if your hardware supports that.</div><br />You can get any waveform with additive synthesis (though a triangle is an easier one, since it will require fewer harmonics to approximate well).

If that's the case, you could do that on the NES, it just wouldn't be very easy due to chewing up a lot of data and the comparatively miniscule RAM.  The C64 handles colors a lot differently than the NES, so color attributes can and will clash.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I think it was an important factor that the NES had graphics capabilities that were competitive for the time, but it was not really important that they be the best. The important thing was that the hardware was versatile and usable enough to make good games, and that the NES had a lot of <em>good games</em>.<br /></div><br /><br />So basically, Nintendo hit the jackpot in terms of hardware design.  They really haven't been able to do that again, but the GameCube did come close.  It just didn't have GTA, which was the be-all end-all of 6th generation games, but despite being the worst selling Nintendo home console, it had more than twice the games of the N64.  They obviously did something right.  Now Nintendo deliberately uses outdated hardware, and it has bit them with the Wii U.

In Flimbo's Quest (which has parallax scrolling unlike anything I've ever seen in any NES game) I think it's done by storing several versions of the same tiles, offset by different amounts, in addition to updating the parallax when the screen is soft scrolled on an 8 pixel boundary. NES games don't usually work like that, because software scrolling is not required, and VRAM bandwidth is limited.

Although the parallax in all those games looks good, it's still very NES-like (= CHR switching + mid-screen scroll changes), and it doesn't give quite the same feeling as a true second layer.

In Flimbo's Quest, that would be the foreground/playable area.  In Thunderbolt, it would be the background.<br /><br />And I'm honestly kinda impressed with City Connection; would it have killed them to put one sprite at the edges of the 'road' to look smother?  I mean the game flickers a lot, but only when there's like three 24-pixel wide police cars on the same line, which it does a lot.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The C64 was a pinnacle of American Engineering.  It could emulate almost any kind of sound you threw at it, when the NES needs expansion audio.  On the flipside, as Rainwarrior said, it has an obscenely loud and harsh sound, and everything just sounds crude.  Doesn't the C64 also suffer from some form of power parasitism?  One of the components starves the SID of power (or vice versa), which might explain that sound.<br /><br />Also, I read conflicting information about the Game Boy's audio.  Some sources say that it had selectable sound channels not unlike the SID (at least, channel 3 could be either triangle or sawtooth while channel 4 could be either noise or DPCM), while many others say it actually used wavetable synthesis for channel 3.  And could the original Game Boy play DPCM samples like the NES?  I know there are some GBC games that make heavy use of DPCM, but only a handful of Game Boy games used the sample channel period.  I think Pokemon Yellow is the most prominent example.
