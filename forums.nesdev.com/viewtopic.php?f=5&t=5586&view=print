<br /> Charles MacDonald and I started a coding contest for the PCE. Putting your optimization skills to the test by running the processor only in slow mode - 1.79mhz.
<br />
<br /> Anyone is welcome to enter the contest. I figured some of you guys might be interested since the CPU is a 65C02 variant and close to home <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />

<br />Hey, I'll offer up a prize to the winner.  I've got a few HuCard PCBs, how about the winner gets their program (or another entry of their choice) on a dedicated card?  I've only got a few, so they're really rare and, uh, exotic (unless I make more).  Sound interesting?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Also it's worth noting that I don't know much about PCE when I designed the card PCB (or even now), but I can say that it was able to run the game called Mesopotamia, and another "??? 2nd Bout" (Japanese) by Human, when I tested it.  Didn't seem to run a couple others I tried.  So if there's a certain setup those games uses, it'd be worth knowing about.  But the max size being 512kB fits right into the requirements. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Also for clarity on the other thread it was described as a flashcart, it uses a FlashROM but won't be reprogrammable, so better describe it in a way that won't disappoint.
<br />
<br />But yeah I'd hope that little prize at least would help to motivate someone.

<br />
<br /> I'm gonna do some promotional entries/samples. I don't plan to have my own entries judged though. And I'm hoping some NES guru's will join <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> There's plenty of time.
