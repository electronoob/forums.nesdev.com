This extends to DMA transfers via OAMDMA, since that uses writes to $2004. For emulation purposes, it is probably best to completely ignore writes during rendering.</div><br />Nintendulator (and probably a few others) do extra stuff.<br />1. If the PPU is <s>not</s> rendering, the value written becomes $FF.<br />2. If $2003 (OAM_ADDR) ANDed with 3 results 2, then the value written is ANDed with $E3.<br /><strong>Why? (edited &amp; fixed)</strong><br /><br />Next question is about the PPU register $2007. From the same source, it seems that any write outside the palette range does not take immediate effect, but &quot;delayed&quot; until the next PPU clock/operation. No, it's not about the 1st read buffer &quot;problem&quot;, but a &quot;phase state&quot;. There's <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_registers#Data_.28.242007.29_.3C.3E_read.2Fwrite" class="postlink">nothing on the wiki</a> about it.<br /><br /><strong>Does writting to $2007 take immediate effect... or not?</strong>

This is actually incorrect behavior and causes flickering sprites on <em>Famicom Mukashibanashi: Yuu Yuu Ki</em>'s title screen. Correct is to ignore OAM writes while the PPU is rendering.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If $2003 ANDed with 3 results 2, then the value written is ORed with $E3.</div>No, it is ANDed with $E3, so that the unused bits 2-4 in <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_OAM" class="postlink">each sprite's byte 2</a> read back as zero even if they had been previously set in the written value.<br /><br />As for the delayed effect of PPU register writes, that is a territory that indeed needs further study. Mesen, for example, assumes that disabling/enabling rendering via $2001 bits 3 and 4 is delayed by 1 PPU cycle, but only for <em>some</em> actions during rendering, while writing an address via $2006 is delayed by 2-3 PPU Cycles. Trying to implement both in Nintendulator slightly improves <em>Micro Machines</em> while messing up the MMC3 scanline counter and test ROM performance. Don't know about $2007.<br /><br /> I also believe that some of these delays by emulators are only necessary because at least in Mesen and Nintendulator, PPU writes are handled asynchronously, basically <em>between</em> calls to the PPU emulation's RunCycle function. A more precise emulation would put the write data and address on the emulated PPU's address and data bus and have RunCycle interpret them and propagate them throughout the device.
