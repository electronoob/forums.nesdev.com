Or maybe a dedicated RC receiver...<br /><br />But it just doesn't obviously connect to any of the player input pins; I don't really see how it could support wireless controllers.

The only real constraint is that the standard 38kHz receivers only support a bandwidth of about 1kHz, but that should still be enough to e.g. have a microcontroller continuously read the buttons, send then as 8n1 1200 baud asynchronous serial, and another microcontroller attached to the NES to decode that.<br /><br />The problem is that the old IR-using controllers still sucked. They used a lot of power and were rather sensitive to being aimed correctly at the receiver.<br /><br />You could probably get away with using something like the CC1100 series of RF-enabled microcontrollers. Zigbee or bluetooth would be better choices for this specific case.

The fact we use 60Hz PAL here, UMC and other companies developed PPU ICs capable of outputting PAL-M video directly (UA6548 or PM-02, for example).

But they have try the 72pin cartridge looking at joypads. Then when the console arrived  works perfectly. Because the cartridge works looking to the tv not the joypads.<br /><br />I buy one of these not working  with the &quot;72 pin fail&quot; for 10e. Lol.

Look at all Nintendo official cart boards, the chips are facing the back of the console/TV. Including Famicom carts.
