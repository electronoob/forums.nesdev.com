<br />
<br /> I'd have to disagree. Not that <em>some</em> people <em>don't</em> say it like that, but to say it's the <em>most</em> natural way - I think would be incorrect. I mean, there's a reason why people say eighteen-hundred instead of one-thousand-eight-hundred or even one-eight-oh-oh, when it comes to saying a number as a name (as in, constantly repeated).
<br />
<br /> People say twenty-six-hundred, eighty-eighty-six, two-eighty-size, seventy-eight-hundred, fifty-two-hundred, etc. It's been my experience in the working field, that model numbers are very much said like this (and I've worked in a few different fields). People often drop the last few digits too, when describing a series: like the sixty-five-hundred series (covers 6502, 6501, 6507, 6510, etc), sixty-eight-thousand series, etc. It's such a common occurrence for people (in the US) to group numbers, of larger numbers, to keep the flow of speech fluid. Especially if this number is going to be repeated quite often (as in a name). We even say it for a given year; eighteen-ten, nineteen-oh-nine, etc. Same for lower numbers too. There's a pattern for grouping numbers in two, right to left. 102 as one-oh-two. 116 as one-sixteen. If the number of digits is odd, one of the digits tends to get isolated. Like 80368 as eighty-three-eighty-six. Or 68020 as sixty-eight-oh-twenty. 65816 as sixty-five-eight-sixteen.
<br />
<br /> So I'd have to say, saying it's the most natural way, is incorrect. Excluding my personal preference and going by existing examples in English (US) language and experience.

<br /> I have never had a need to discuss such things in a professional setting so perhaps it can very between people having a casual conversation compared to people using the terms when it is similar to things involved in there field of work.

<br />Here in Argentina there is a famous US zipcode popularized by the series "Beverly Hills 90210"
<br />
<br />Back in the nineties I always heard and said "Ninety two ten" (Noventa dos diez) but always in spanish.
<br />
<br />Now, with the recent remake of the series, I think it's on cable channel Sony, although the channel is in spanish, the series name is pronounced in english, and it says "Nine oh two one oh".
<br />
<br />I guess maybe that grouping digits when reading numbers is something particular in Argentina or spanish-speaking communities.

<br />
<br />That leads me to another linguistic question:
<br />What do you say? "ARM" or "a-ar-em"?
<br />"NES" or "en-e-es"?
<br />I've always heard "en-e-es" from english speakers, but I always called it the "nes" pretty much as the scottish, monster-inhabited lake.

<br />
<br />As for NES, I just say "NES" pronounced like the character for Earthbound or the famous monster. Therefore I say "A NES game" Rather than "An NES game" because an would be grouped with En, but not NES. I'm not sure on the "properness" of any of that, but less syllables is a selling point for me when pronouncing stuff.

Nine-oh-two-one-oh. Has a certain sonic to the way it rolls of the tongue (see poetry &amp; sonics). I don't remember anyone saying zipcodes any other way. But then again, zipcodes aren't names like model numbers are. And almost always want to be clear when giving the zipcode for shipping info, etc. Though street address numbers can go either way, from my experience (but again, not really a model/name thing). There's an apartment complex here with the name "7700 Place". Everyone refers to it as seventy-seven-hundred-place, including the management. Just another instance where the number becomes a name and said differently.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">"NES" or "en-e-es"? </div>
<br />
<br /> Both, actually. And SNES as "snes" and es-en-e-es. But when you say "snes", almost sounds like an onomatopoeia for sneezing.

<br />Ah, thanks for making me realize I'm wrong about what I said like two minutes ago. I guess I don't always go for less syllables, since I also say es-en-e-es. I dislike the sound of SNES (rhyming with chess) as well.
