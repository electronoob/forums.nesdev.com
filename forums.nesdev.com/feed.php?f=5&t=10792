Yeah, GUI tools are fine for one-off conversions, but what if you want to tweak something at the beginning and do all the conversion steps again? Oh, and again after making another change? GUIs are about manually doing things over and over, making little errors or not doing it exactly the same each time.

Well I understand that as a user, a command prompt is not very appealing, but trust me as a programmer it is. You can make programs which are much smaller, faster and simpler than if you wanted to deal with buttons, menus and all this stuff. I made it pretty clear in the doc how to use it (and there is no need for Java any longer) so it should be simple enough for anyone.<br /><br />Also you can use brrtools to batch convert a large set of .wav files into .brr for instance. You could even make a script that search all .spc files in your disk drive and rip all samples from them. You can't do that ever with SNESSor. However, if you want to plain rip samples from a SNES ROM (not a SPC file), SNESSor does it very well, and I didn't bother to implement it because well SNESSor already does it well.<br /><br />What I was talking about is just an idea right now but I'd really like to make it true. It would not be related to famitracker in any way, exept the fact it'd allow to compose music for video game consoles. My idea is to make something much more efficient that is usable in actual games. Also it'd be based on Music Macro language (MML) and not a tracker, so you'd just edit music with Notepad and compile it with the command line in some form of binary, which can then be included with a build of a SPC, or other music format.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Dec 15, 2013 12:58 pm</p><hr />
