In this case for megaman1 i've used Farid's patch and for megaman 2 i've used Infidelity's patch.<br />Note: if i first start megaman 1, reset and start megaman 2, the game will also have audio distorsion.<br /><br />Another test: megaman 1 and 2, both with infidelity's patch. Both have audio distorsion.

Ill give a more thorough explaination when I get the chance, but what I can tell you is that rom does boot up as mmc3, but chr/mirroring are 2 major factors that I need to tackle. Im fixing them, making progress.

Castlevania works perfectly, no matter wich one i start.<br />Now i only replaced megaman 1,2 and 4 with Castlevania mmc3. Castlevania starts, but after the intro (when he enters the gate), i get a black screen, no matter wich game i select.<br />Next I replaced Megaman 1,2 and 6 with castlevania mmc3. Castlevania works perfectly, no matter wich one i start.<br />So, it's something wrong with my wiring or with the menu?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ninja Gaiden MMC3 is about 95% complete. Need to figure how to have the text for both the cutscenes and the in-game hud, to display correctly. The text shows up as whatever tiles are stored currently in the ppu, they get fetched from somewhere else in the rom. Its been a long time since ive worked with something like this. I had to rewrite how $8000-$8001 read gaiden's chr setup. But when I try to have 2 sets of routines, the in-game palette fade in gets stuck in a weird loop, and the chr routine doesnt work. This is the only issue left with this game from becoming a full MMC3 port.<br /><br />EDIT - Freak luck, I was able to get the text to appear for the cutscenes. <br /><br />Now im still trying to decypher in-game co-existences of 2 chr setups, very difficult.<br /><br />EDIT #2 - Making progress, found a workaround but it aint pretty looking code wise, but its being allowed to work and display. Hoping by tonight or tomorrow to have it finished.

FARID teste it on a famiclone, maybe doesn't work right on an original nes, or maybe i did something wrong (i checked everything many times) or maybe the blame is on the 74 chips.<br />FARID said at one moment that had in mind a ninja gaiden trilogy. That will be easyer to build because each game has only 128k chr and 128k prg, so you can use 2x 29f040, dip32.
