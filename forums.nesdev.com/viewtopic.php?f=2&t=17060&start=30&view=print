GDB has been supporting this usr-case for a long time now, and even Visual Studio can use GDBserver.</div><br />From my experience the gdb remote protocol isn't quite as generic as you'd hope it to be and often makes some target-specific assumptions. Could be troublesome if gdb/gdbserver doesn't know about 6502. It was also very prone to other kinds of compatibility problems. I have limited experience though so might be mistaken here.<br /><br />Anyway, I wouldn't make the emulator talk to VS Code directly. The VS Code protocol is very high level, so that would lead to duplicated effort in other emulators. Instead, the emulator would talk to the debug adapter (supplying register values, memory contents, etc.), and the debug adapter would talk to VS Code. Even if there are some problems, the gdb protocol might make sense for the emulator&lt;-&gt;adapter communication.

Instead it seems to trigger about 1/4 of the screen to the left of it (and similarly for the Y position, I have to go up to find the tooltip).<br />YearsBehind_shifted_tooltip.png<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<br />
	</div><br /><br /><br />Do you know what could be causing this misbehavior?<br /><br />I also had a look at how the writes in the second part of Years Behind are affected by the DPCM, and am... somewhat surprised. As they appear to be very badly out-of-sync whenever DPCM plays.<br /><br />Here's a few screenshots:<br />YearsBehind_exploder.png<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<br />
	</div><br /><br />- This is the original tune by Chibi-Tech with no DPCM playing, so all bars are almost perfectly vertical save for the 2/3 cycle/scanline oscillation, as expected.<br /><br />YearsBehind_gradius.png<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

			<span class="gensmall">YearsBehind_Gradius.png [ 145.83 KiB | Viewed 879 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div><br /><br />- This is how the demo looks while playing the &quot;Gradius&quot; cover by Memblers. The bars are no longer nicely vertical, which is expected. But the big shift to the right is not.<br /><br />YearsBehind_Hyperspace.png<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
			<a href="./download/file.php?id=11929&amp;mode=view"><img src="./download/file.php?id=11929&amp;t=1" alt="YearsBehind_Hyperspace.png" /></a><br />
			<span class="gensmall">YearsBehind_Hyperspace.png [ 149.33 KiB | Viewed 879 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div><br /><br />- This is is how it looks while playing the &quot;Hyperspace&quot; cover by Memblers. It's even worse, and besides the big shift to the right of the PPU register write debug pixels there's also corruption on the bottom part of the blue blob.<br /><br />Now, it was a long, long time since I wrote this code and memory is a bit vague in the details, so it's not impossible I did mess this approach up in the end. But I do distinctively remember spending loads of hours adjusting the fractional phase accumulator for each of the 16 sample playback rates, in order to make my set-unset-monochrome-bit debug bar look as vertical as possible even when DPCM samples were playing. I don't think I got it &quot;perfect&quot; as I was just observing a fuzzy and jittering bar, but it did look a lot more closer to vertical than what I'm now seeing in Mesen's PPU Write visualiser.<br /><br />And the demo also seems to glitch a lot more in Mesen than it does on a real PAL NES (where there is just an occasional very subtle glitch on the scroll text, about once every half a minute. And which I think will only happens if you're unlucky with the reset phase, IIRC.<br /><br />So I am wondering if Mesen could possibly have the DMA cycle steal slightly wrong for PAL machines? As I'm on vacation I can't really confirm this by trying the debug-thing on my real PAL NES. But I'll see if I can get some hacked debug code to test with other emulators tomorrow and see what they show. (and if anyone else has a PAL machine+powerpak+free time I'd be eager to find this out)

I'll take a look.<br /><br />Mesen's PAL emulation (and I'd even be tempted to say every emulator's PAL emulation) is probably not as robust as NTSC, so I wouldn't be too surprised if there are some issues.  There are few PAL test roms, and most of them only test relatively basic behavior.  Does the PAL version have any known difference in behavior vs DMC cycle stealing?  Mesen implements this as stealing 4 cycles normally, and 3 cycles if it lands on the last cycle of a write instruction ($4014-related quirks aside) - I tried tweaking it to always steal 3 cycles, but then the bars end up shifting more and more to the left (instead of the right).

I have had the 125% setting since forever though, so it's a bit of a bummer to have to revert it. But if there's no other way then I'll switch just for this cool new debugging mode <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I've hacked the Years Behind demo to replace the scroll writes in the second part with the set/unset monochrome-bit&amp;intensify-blue sequence i originally used when building the DPCM adjustment table back in 2003. And it consistently shows the same shearing in Mesen, FCEUX and Nintendulator. Which makes me suspect that maybe I'm the one who got things a bit wrong after all. But in that case, it's still a bit of a mystery as to why the glitches are so much worse in the emulators than on a real PAL NES.<br /><br />I'll make sure to run this debug version on my PAL NES when I'm back from vacation. But if anyone else with a PAL NES and flashcart wants to beat me to it, it's available <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Uxsdx6t6Y4xjdIMyRzEDelK4vlOplhYZ" class="postlink">here</a>.

And since testing requires firing up a Windows VM with higher DPI (or rebooting my computer), I don't do it that often :p<br /><br />As far as PAL goes, it's possible there might still be some quirks about the PAL NES that are not known.  As far as I know, Mesen implements all of the PAL NES' known differences vs NTSC (at least, those I am aware of), including the slightly bigger window where sprite DMA can be performed, etc.<br /><br />Both issues should be fixed in this build: <a href="https://www.mesen.ca/MesenFeb18.zip" class="postlink">download</a> <br />Let me know if you find any other issue.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Oziphantom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Having the ability to easy invoke the debugger from the main game window would be nice. </div>What do you mean by this?

I can confirm it works on my side too <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Oh, and another small issue: As Tokumaru mentioned, the ppu write visualisation can be really useful for studying the vblank write patterns as well - especially to catch the typical error of your vram writes ending up outside of vblank. <br /><br />But I noticed that Mesen currently always has the window be 262 scanlines. Could we get the full 312 scanlines for PAL?<br /><br />And thinking further, I think this kind of visualisation could be really good for other types of hardware-related events as well, such as getting those dots where the vblank NMI occurred, where the sprite#0 hit got set, and where an IRQ occurred. <br /><br />Even better if it could be slightly configured too, kind of like a generic conditional breakpoint but with it adding to the visualisation instead of interrupting your program. (Pardon the feature creep... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

(I excluded sprite DMA since it triggers a bunch of very visible $2004 writes already)<br /><br />Adding conditional expressions to mark specific points on the screen would be possible, but having to add a bunch of UI just to add/delete/edit those is kind of annoying.  I could add a fixed number of &quot;condition&quot; text fields to the window and have each condition display in a different color easily enough, though.  Keep in mind conditionals are mean on performance (esp. since in this case they would need to be evaluated on every PPU cycle, instead of every CPU cycle) - each condition will probably each drop max FPS by 5-10%.
