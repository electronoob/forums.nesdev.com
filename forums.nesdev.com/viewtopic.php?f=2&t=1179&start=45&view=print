The variability of the DMC IRQ is compensated for by repeating the 16 rows above the switch in the bottom of the second pattern table, allowing the switch to occur anywhere between scanlines 112 and 128.

<br />Quietust: This is just a tech demo, not a complete program. I've added the standard init code now and used my devcart's special test-at-reset and test-at-powerup functions to ensure it's not depending on the devcart environment. Any other peripheral issues I must know about?
<br />
<br />As for the font's compact nature, it was something I made for a Tandy 102-based word processor a while back, aimed at fitting as much text on screen as possible. It might be better to use a less-tight font.

From what I'm seeing, the text has to be hardcoded into the .nes file, right? Exactly how useful would that be?</div>
<br />
<br />If the device has a filesystem and allows reading of text files directly, there's no need for this NES-based reader. If not, there's no way the NES program could access the filesystem without writing custom software for the device, and if you're doing that, you might as well write a native text reader. If it doesn't read text files, just use a PC program to package the text with the NES ROM and then pretend that .nes files are .txt files on the device.

<br />My device play regular rom, I can take a rom on internet and play it on my PDVD. But I can't take a file on the VCD I have with the PDVD for playing on my computer, like I explain in my last post. So I don't think there is emulator limitation. 
<br />
<br />My PDVD doesn't give me information about the emulator. I know the "brain" Chip is a Sunplus SPHE 8281A. The file system doesn't show long file name, I don't know if it's important for you. 
<br />
<br />Perhaps there is .nes file for testing configuration or extract the name of the emulator or take other informations for testing ?

<br />Very good!  Anyway, francois have you run Blargg's series of NES test roms on your device?  That might give us an idea of what works and what does not on that emulator.

The timing of Tetramino's region detection was adjusted for Nintendulator 0.950, which is known to behave like an NES in 99.44% of cases. We may have to approach this not as an NES programming project but as a really-bad-famiclone programming project.

<br />Not really. In this case, "bad" could mean "forgiving", meaning it will let go on things that the real system wouldn't (bad timing, for example). So, the fact that you have a "good" emulator does not mean it will run all the stuff that runs on the "bad" emulator, simply because they are different enough for one to be called "good" and the other one "bad". And "different" is practically the opposite of "compatible".

<br />That's not exactly true. Pretty soon, I will own 6 systems that can play NES/FC games. 3 original NESes, 2 Yobo Famiclones (1 is 60 pin, and one is 72 pin), and I will soon be the owner of the original famicom. So yeah, a lot of people have NES consoles.

<br />Somebody have a lot of NES consoles. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> 
<br />
<br />So, it seem normal that an emulator play with one simple chipset can't be 100% compatible with all the parameters, variable, etc... of the NES langage. For me, it's a miracle that this device can play all the nes rom game that I find on the net.
<br />
<br />I hope that it's possible to do this usefull tool. Thank you for all
