Compare the list starting at <a href="https://github.com/cc65/cc65/blob/master/src/ca65/instr.c#L215" class="postlink">line 215 of instr.c</a> to the <a href="http://cc65.github.io/doc/ca65.html#6502X-mode" class="postlink">list in the documentation</a>. Which set do think it makes sense to highlight? Maybe the discrepancy is something to file as in issue with the cc65 project.

There is also (AFAIK) no &quot;universally agreed-upon&quot; set of mnemonics for those opcodes -- Tepples listed a couple, but there are more than just that.  But I suppose it does make sense to implement the names that ca65 uses internally (the docs being wrong should be fixed too, maybe file a ticket on that; I don't know where/how ca65 is maintained at this point as the cc65.org domain says the author gave up maintaining it in 2013 and I couldn't exactly figure out where the &quot;real&quot; home page is now).<br /><br />If you do implement the illegal instructions per ca65 naming scheme, I would politely suggest making the opcodes some different colour -- red comes to mind (or if it were me, I'd be going with white bolded text on red background).

I thought about using the &quot;Error&quot; highlight group (they are illegal after all!), but decided that's too extreme, as most people expect that to indicate actual syntax errors.<br /><br />I've also added an auto-indent plugin and a filetype plugin. Since I've now gone beyond the scope of just syntax highlighting, the github repo is now just <a href="https://github.com/maxbane/vim-asm_ca65" class="postlink">vim-asm_ca65</a> rather than vim-syntax-asm_ca65 <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />See the README.md (or github page) for the full feature list.
