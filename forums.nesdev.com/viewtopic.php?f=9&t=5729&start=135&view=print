<br />Sounds normal to me.  Maybe it's a PAL vs NTSC issue?

I transferred the USA version and it is indeed working properly. But I'm not sure if it's known but Bubble Bath Babe and Maxi-15 have their GFX all messed up.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Nintendo's NES-CNROM board supports only four 8 KiB banks of CHR ROM. Bubble Bath Babes uses a CNROM-compatible board that supports more memory. I seem to remember old PowerPak mappers not supporting more than CNROM's 32 KiB for mapper 3, but I'm under the impression that one of the later versions of PowerPak mappers emulates the other board as well. I know BNROM (mapper 34 with CHR RAM) got extended to a full 512 KiB upon my request.

<br />I have a current issue with Low G Man.  The latest MAP04.MAP here causes graphical glitches on the status bar and the game crashed at the first boss.  It also caused jumpy subscreens and level select screens in Megaman 3, so I tried the ones on this thread : <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=8337">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=8337</a><!-- m -->

<br />The second one was the only one that did not cause glitches in Low G Man or other MMC3 games, but the boss music for Low G Man sounded "warbly" compared to a real cart.

<br />I've heard that Low G Man requires WRAM enable/disable to work, the crashing in the boss thing might be related to that, but I haven't verified it. WRAM enable flag is currently disabled, I believe, in loopy's mappers (and in mine as well) to get StarTropics 1 and 2 to work. I don't think it's possible to fix this in an easy way without one of these: 1) implementing iNES 2.0 support 2) patching the ROM 3) checking ROM checksums.

<br />EDIT: WRAM protection -&gt; WRAM enable

<br />Low G Man uses TLROM, it does not have WRAM.  I heard it is an issue of emulating an open bus.  Of course, for those games that use WRAM or SRAM, a conflict may arise.

<br />Actually I said it wrong, I meant "WRAM enable" when I said "WRAM protection". Yes, Low G Man doesn't use WRAM, but it checks for its presence (or so I've heard). To be more specific, it excepts to read out open bus after disabling the WRAM. This is not true for the current mappers (WRAM is always enabled), and changing that would break StarTropics 1 and 2. The reason for this is that StarTropics 1 and 2 are often marked as MMC3 when in fact they use MMC6.

<br />
<br />I understand all that, it is a limitation of mapper 4, which lumps in virtually all MMC3/6 boards.  Any game that uses WRAM, whether battery backed or not, would break if it were not present.  This includes HKROM, TKROM and TSROM boards.  However, Low-G-Man uses TLROM, which does not have WRAM, so why would it disable the WRAM?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It disables it incase it's actually there I guess. If your board doesn't have it then you get open bus but if you do then you need to disable it to get open bus. Generally when emulating iNES 1.0 and most rom images don't really have a reliable way of identifying if they need WRAM or not unless it's always battery backed. So you usually allow WRAM even if games don't use it since normally it has no negative effect.

What needs to be done for the MAP file?  Looking at a hex editor it seems that more than just changing the file name is necessary.
