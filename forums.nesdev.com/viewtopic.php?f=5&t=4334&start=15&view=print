		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />About the starting new lines, my format would basically "connect the dots" where it takes point A and B, and draws a line between them. But after that, point B becomes point A and a new set of coords is defined for point B. So I don't have to take 4 bytes for every line, I just need 2. Like I said, it's like those "connect the dots" puzzles where you basically draw from wherever you are to the next dot. The "new line" thing basically picks up the pencil and moves to the next defined point without drawing a new line. Sorry, I'm not very good at explaining things...
<br />
<br />Also, polygon filling takes up as much CHR space as wireframe does + 3 tiles, so I don't think I'd be eating up CHR space by having a more full screen. I'm going to have to go through every frame by hand and adjust it so it doesn't use over 256 tiles, so it's just going to be tedious work. This sounds like it'd be really hard, but sometimes just shifting something 1 pixel to the left saves you a bunch of tiles.
<br />
<br />I'm actually not sure what I'm going to do... I don't really know anything about other graphics formats. If I did a bitmap, I would probably use bright pink (Or some wierd color) points to define the points that I draw lines to, but I'll have to think some more.

You know, many drawing APIs have a MoveTo command, which places the "pen" at a certain coordinate without drawing anything, and a LineTo command that draws a line from the current point to the next. Maybe something similar works for you?

Because of my level compression, there is a limited number of blocks I can use, so the converter always indicates if I'm running out of blocks. Your conversion tool could do the same thing and indicate problematic frames.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'm actually not sure what I'm going to do...

<br />You could probably have points of the same color be part of the same polygon. This would make it easier for a converter to pick up the points. The hard part would be to guess the correct order of the points.
<br />
<br />Did you check out the SVG format I told you about? I know it's another format and you are not familiar with it, but since SVG images are XML files, it means they can be read as text! Seriously, open them in notepad and you can read the whole image. Reading those files is piece of cake, you'd just have to look for the shapes you'll support (for example, there is a "&lt;rect&gt;" tag for rectangles) and convert them to your polygon type. You don't have to support it all, just the basic polygons, so you can ignore the rest. Much easier than making a vector (which your movie format is) out of a bitmap.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I suppose end polygon and new line mean the same thing... Sorry about the confusion.
<br />
<br />I've dealt with SVGs  before, but I never really looked into the actual format of it before. I'll look more into this. I'll probably figure out more about my editor's capabilities after I look more at SVG format.
<br />
<br />I'm afraid though about what I should do for drawing new frames... Since I can't use MMC3's scanline counter, I'm not sure what I'll do about blanking. Also, updating 1k of PPU data with only lda/sta absolute statements will take 8092 cycles. Obviously, I want this to be space efficient, so this isn't realistic. I figure if I used my current loop I figure it'll take about 9600 cycles, which isn't so bad for a loop considering how close it is to direct lda/sta.
<br />
<br />And even worse, I need to update 5k of PPU data, so even if I could update a whole kilobyte a frame, it would take 5 frames just for updating, which doesn't include line drawing/polygon filling. I figure it'd take 1-2 frames to draw the virtual screen, so I'm looking at 60/7 = ~8.57 FPS. This is not a great frame rate.
<br />
<br />Sorry for speaking in real time, but I just recalculated my loop length and it turns out for the name table update it'll only take 8600-8700 cycles! That's still like 76 scanlines, but if I blank around 40 scanlines on top and bottom (Though I've heard it screws things up when blanking on top), that'll get me enough time... Any ideas on how I should go about blanking? I suppose I could do a sprite 0 hit for the bottom part, and have fixed time code so it will keep the screen off and wrap around to the top and then shut it off after 40 scanlines or so have passed. Is this a bad idea?

<br />You should detect blank tiles and make them point to the same actual tiles. So if your image contains enough "blanks" areas, you could get a larger surface and still deal with the 256-tile limit.
<br />The problem is that you then have to write to name table as well, as if pattern tables aren't enough.
<br />
<br />Also, in a FMV, video, chances are that  a frame will be very similar to the frame just before that. Using this cleverly would save you a lot of trouble I guess.

<br />Yeah, we were discussing ways of taking advantage of temporal redundancy. But I think Celius wants to get the basics working, and then think of possible optimizations.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, my PSet function takes care of that. Given an X,Y pair, it fetches the tile at that set of coords from a copy of the name table in SRAM. If the tile ID is 0-3, then the tile is blank, and the next available tile in the pattern tables is put down. Though I still haven't implemented a key function: When it goes to the next tile, the next tile is going to be filled with color 0. If I check and the tile ID is #2 (Which means it's filled with color #2), and I'm filling on the opposite bit plane, it's going to set a blank color #0 tile there, and fill in what it needs to, leaving the part that would be color #2 color #0. I still get these errors, which is bad.
<br />
<br />Another problem is that this uses as many tiles as wireframe does. Say you had a line that was going straight down on the very left edge of a tile. If you filled this in, it would be a solid color tile. Though my engine sees this as a unique tile, because it was made a unique tile in the line drawing engine. I think it would take too much of my valuable time to save tile space, so I just have to deal with it.
<br />
<br />I was thinking of doing possibly layered video. For example, if there's a key item in the background that will always be there, why redefine it? Though I'll be getting the "glass" effect if I'm not careful; since my engine is layering bit planes of polygons, if I but a color #2 polygon over a color #1 polygon, it will turn to a color #3 polygon. Though this is desirable in many cases, it isn't most of the time.
<br />
<br />I suppose I could do some sort of ANDing with the layers to eliminate this effect, but that might take too much time, which I barely have any of as it is.

<br />
<br />Okay, it's really not that exciting. There's not much to this demo I know, and I still haven't come up with a movie/format for a movie. It's basically a frame changing demo. But the glass effect is oddly fun to look at. I put this off for a while after I had to do away with the Bresenham line algorithm, because it wasn't fast enough. Now I can draw about 3 pixels per scanline for each line. This is good as a new pixel is only drawn for every X. So if a line is 128 pixels tall, and 2 pixels wide, I only draw 2 pixels. XOR filling will take a little longer though.
<br />
<br />So now lines are defined with a 16-bit Y slope and an 8-bit X Run. So I have to rethink the format of movies a little more.
<br />
<br />I still have to do a little optimizing, as it's running at less than 10 FPS. The best speed it could possibly run at is 12 FPS. It takes 5 frames to update the PPU. If I could draw the virtual screen in 160 scanlines, it would. But this isn't realistic, so it'll take a little more than a frame, making the frame rate 10 FPS. Oh well, it'll still be entertaining to watch!
<br />
<br />If anyone wants to test this on a real NES, it needs 8k SRAM and 16k PRG. That's all. I'd be happy to hear if it works.
<br />
<br />Oh, and usually I don't double post, but this time, I really don't care.

<br />There is a few glitches in the leftmost 8 pixels tough. Maybe you should hide them using clipping ?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh, good point. I should have mentioned it. I'm actually not planning on showing anything in the leftmost column. The reason there are what seem to be glitches is because as I use a solid 8x8 pixel white tile to do a sprite #0 hit. I turn on clipping while I'm updating the "virtual" frame. This process will probably take longer, and if I don't turn on clipping, you'll see an ugly white tile on the side. I have to display this while updating the PPU though, as I read that sprite #0 hits only happen when the column is rendered. So it flashes in that column because clipping is turned on and off.
<br />
<br />Here's how it would look without it:

<br />Nestopia disables SRAM automatically when it sees mapper 0 that's probably why it don't work (just like my "mode7" demo).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No, for some reason it doesn't work in Nestopia. I currently have it set to MMC3, and SRAM is enabled. The program is running, and it updates the palette correctly... Maybe for some reason it still isn't using SRAM. Why would it do that? Even if I don't do any of this during blanked portions of each frame, it still loads those stripes into the pattern tables. I wish Nestopia would have a few more basic debugging features, like pattern table VIEWING.
<br />
<br />Oh, and I do clear SRAM before I write to it. I don't see what the problem would be. I'm not doing any fancy tricks or NES hardware specific features. After all, that's what I was trying to avoid. A sprite #0 hit for blanking, and I just turn on the screen again once it's done. This really shouldn't have anything to do with incorrectly resetting the scroll either, which I'm pretty sure I do as it works in FCEUXD and Nintendulator. So I think it'd be a problem with either writing to/reading from SRAM, or updating the pattern tables. It's not a problem with my algorithm, I don't think. Why wouldn't simple math work in Nestopia?
<br />
<br />But the glass effect is what you were talking about Roth.
<br />
<br />And about making movies, it would take a lot of polygons for every frame. Probably not 2! But this wouldn't cause much slow down or anything. Once virtual drawing passes the first 160 scanline mark (XOR filling takes most of this, too), it has a whole frame including Vblank more to keep updating. For the most complex of frames, it would have another. It waits until it's completely done.
<br />
<br />Oh, and Bregalad; that's a GREAT idea! I'll go see about implementing that now.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Okay, so here's something weird. I changed the mapper to MMC1, since I didn't do anything mapper specific besides access SRAM, I thought this would be okay. When I open up the file in Nintendulator, all of these updates are completely visible. But when I open it in Nestopia, it works perfectly fine. What is the deal with that?
<br />
<br />I think I might be doing something wrong MMC3 related, because it doesn't work when I use MMC3 in Nestopia.
<br />
<br />EDIT 2: Thanks so much for the suggestion Bregalad! Here's the new and improved demo:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.freewebs.com/the_bott/polygonnoclip.nes">http://www.freewebs.com/the_bott/polygonnoclip.nes</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />It looks a lot better without the flashing white line and clipping. The only thing I kind of regret is not being able to have visible borders to make it look more cinematic. But this would require a lot of work, as now I can take however long I want to draw the virtual frame. This means there is no blanking or timed code at all when that's drawn. The timing begins AFTER that. So if I were to have borders visible, they would be flashing and look bad.
<br />
<br />EDIT 3: Maybe the final edit, but I just tested it on Nestopia, and it appears that the battery backup isn't being altered at all. I can change the data in it with a hex editor, and it will be untouched by the program. This is most likely the problem. Though it says that it's acknowledging the presence of SRAM...
