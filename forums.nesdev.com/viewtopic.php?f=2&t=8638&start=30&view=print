<br />
<br />I don't think it's fair to say he has a monopoly.  There simply hasn't been anyone else who's even tried really.  And like your saying about quantity, he's making a large quantity and charging much less than it would cost an individual to make a few.  A PCB for $4 and a PCB w/CPLD for $9 is pretty cheap, you're going to spend $30-50 for 3 PCBs unless you etch it yourself.
<br />
<br />I'd like to whip up the MMC3 on a board myself, but it's just a matter of actually doing it.  That and I realize how people would like the capabilities for producing a game with MMC3 but how many games would actually get produced that would use it?  There's only a few games being developed that would make use of MMC3 to my knowledge right now.

<br />
<br />Thanks Bregalad for the hardware perspective of why the MMC1 would be like that. From the little hardware dabbling I've done, I can appreciate the value of reducing the pin count. But from software (my strong side), it just seems weird.

<br />For me, the main problem with this is not the monopoly (others are free to offer the same service in case they want to), but the possibility of something happening to bunnyboy. If he decides to change business, dies, wins the lottery and gives up working, whatever, we're screwed, because he's the only one around who's able to make new carts without cannibalizing anything from old ones.

I just used Bregalad's wording for the early pages because it was late at night and I couldn't think of a better way to explain that one. It's just that I don't remember playing a lot of NES games that change a heck of a lot of tiles in each frame. Even Super Mario Bros. 3 uses only a few tiles from its animated bank ($0800-$0FFF) in each level, like the spinning coins and the spinning ? blocks, and those could probably be blasted to CHR RAM.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Might also want to add extended mappers, like the bigger B*ROM used by Action 53 and 512KB U*ROM used by BK2.</div><br />I've tested 512 KiB B*ROM on a PowerPak but not yet 512 KiB U*ROM. The latter would need a 74377 instead of a 74161. How big does the discrete ReproPak actually go in that configuration?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I was trying to land on B*ROM (maybe it's not considering the extended version?) but it gave me friggin MMC1, which I absolutely hate!</div>
<br />It's treating B*ROM as having three PRG bank bits like AOROM, or a total of 256 KiB of PRG ROM. If you choose no IRQs and either 257-512 KiB of total data or switchable mirroring, you end up with SUROM or SKROM/SLROM.

<br />But AxROM actually uses the 4th bit for something (mirroring), unlike BxROM, so it doesn't make much sense to not use that bit to double the capacity of the mapper.

<br />Wouldn't an open sourced piece of hardware similar to that solve many problems at once?

The 161 is in the position for AxROM, but you solder the HORIZ or VERT pads instead of the ONE pads. I don't even think there's a trace for PRG A18.
<br />
<br />slobu: Say someone made a reprogrammable NES cartridge. Which mapper would this board implement? There are a lot more mappers on the NES than on any other 8-bit platform because only the NES has CHR ROM. But as I understand it, the 8T-ROM is supposed to be something like the Melody board. And once it comes out and gets emulated, remind me and I'll update the wizard. Right now the closest thing, a board reprogrammable for multiple discrete mappers, might be a PowerPak Lite with its PRG RAM replaced with flash memory.
<br />
<br />As for the CHR ROM vs. CHR RAM section, is the wording in <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/CHR-ROM_vs_CHR-RAM" class="postlink">this wiki article</a> OK?
