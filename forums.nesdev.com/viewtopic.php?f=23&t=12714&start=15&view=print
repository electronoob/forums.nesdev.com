The ColecoVision and Sega SG-1000 had a 3.6 MHz Z80 but were otherwise identical in specs to the CreatiVision, down to the same amount of RAM and the same video chip. The successor to the SG-1000, the Sega Master System, had the same 3.6 MHz Z80, which was comparable to the 1.8 MHz 6502 in the NES.<br /><br />If you want to get technical, you can see why clock speed doesn't matter. The NES and Super NES both run at 21.5 MHz. They just have a divider in front of the CPU core. The original Super Game Boy also runs at 21.5 MHz, with a different divider on its CPU core to produce 4.3 MHz for the Z80-like Game Boy CPU.

Were the 65xx series of processors abnormally good in this regard, or where the Z80 and the 68000 just bad? Another thing: I heard that in order to change clock speed, you need a higher frequency crystal or something. Now I don't know what that means and it kind of reminds me of the crystal in a light saber, but does it cost the same amount to make a 6502 faster as a Z80 in terms of clock speed?

I would imagine that they eventually managed to revise the chip to dissipate less heat at higher frequencies.<br /><br />Another limiting factor is the delays inherent in how the circuitry works, though I think this has traditionally been a smaller factor than heat. It takes time for a transistor to switch from off to on. This can also be improved with progressively refined engineering.

The Master System uses a custom extended TMS9918, and we've discussed before how the NES PPU's architecture was <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=5039" class="postlink">inspired by the TMS9918's ability to run pixel-perfect <em>Donkey Kong</em></a>.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The NES and Super NES both run at 21.5 MHz.

Transistors that switch faster cost more; compare the price of modern Intel CPUs rated for different speeds.

The SNES's CPU doesn't even have a heat sink, and they're worrying about heat? I would have loved to see stronger PPUs.</div><br /><br />That is patently false. All CPUs generate heat.<br /><br />The use of a heat sink is an engineering problem. Whether it's appropriate depends on how much difference it makes, how do you anchor it to the CPU, what's the added cost, etc. There's lots of situations where no practical heat sink is going to dissipate heat fast enough to make a worthwhile difference. You can't just add heat sinks until it's cool enough; it's not that simple.<br /><br /><br />People have overclocked all of these systems at some point. Look this up if you want to see how much faster they could adjust the clock speed before it reaches failure. It could be tempterature, it could be switching speed, or it could be other factors, but what you'll find invariably is that it can't really go <em>that</em> much faster, and is usually very limited by an overheating problem. They didn't just arbitrarily restrict the speed on you, they made it as fast as they practically could, always leaving an overhead to try to ensure it would be as reliable on a hot summer day as a cold winter night.<br /><br />The exception to this rule is if a new revision of the CPU rated for higher speeds eventually becomes cheaper, later revisions of the unit might use these but be stuck at the original specified speed. (See the progression of the Nintendo DS for the opposite example of letting the specification be revised to keep up with technology.)<br /><br />You did get to see stronger PPUs, you just had to wait for them to become practical. PS1 had a stronger one than SNES. XBox 360 had a stronger one than PS1. There's been progress in the technology. Why do you think we didn't have a PS4 in 1985? Do you really think it's just because somebody arbitrarily decided to run a CPU at 1/100th of the speed it was capable?

If you're not planning on making this into a real life cartridge, the sky is the limit. And of course on the Neo Geo, they weren't concerned about memory in the slightest...<br /><br /><img src="http://www.supergaijinultragamer.org/wp-content/gallery/neogeo-aes/neogeo-aes-cart-comparison.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />You can't always decompress graphics too, unless you want slowdown. One thing I wonder though: has there ever been a cartridge system that used vram that could be expanded in the cartridge? I know the NES has an ounce of VRAM, but it only really holds the pattern table? I just think CHR is the better option in terms of, basically anything but cost, (that's basically why every 80's-90's arcade board uses it, including the Neo Geo) and vram is only good for cost effective reasons. Again, vram wouldn't be a problem if you could expand it in any of these systems. I've talked about before how it seems that the SNES was originally supposed to have 128KB of vram, but I don't know if that's true or not.
