I have a new web site <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.jamesturner.de/">http://www.jamesturner.de/</a><!-- m --> which will eventually host WedNESday some time next year alongside other programs that I have written. At the moment there is only 1 program available for download.<br /><br />This programs deletes bad dumps of ROMs leaving only the good ones behind. I wrote this for myself but also thought that others would find it useful. The readme.txt describes how to use the program. This is the first thing that I have ever written and published so fingers crossed! You can find it under the Software section of the site but do check out other pages as well.<br /><br />If you do download it please report any bugs and let me know what you think by posting below. Please read the disclaimer before using!<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />James

Oh I bet it's just because it's less expensive or something.<br /><br />Anyway congratulations, there is not much on it right now but I know it's a though decision to have a website and maintain it. I know because I decided to take mine off since I wasn't uploading it for years anyway, but right now I am thinking about making it up again, but just thinking about the collosal work that makes (even for a tiny website) makes me delays this task forever, as it's pretty low in my &quot;todo&quot; list.<br /><br />Also there's the dilema of using my real-name vs. just using Bregalad. Both have their advantages and drawbacks. I'd still opt for my real name, but then the link between the two becomes obvious and while for most of the time I would not care, in some cases it could play very nasty tricks against me.

And since I've been living on and off in Germany it was a natural choice.<br /><br />I'm just going for a very basic web site at the moment until I can get more software up. I'll start posting screenshots of WedNESday hopefully within a week.<br /><br />Btw, did you download and use the program? If so, did it run ok etc.? I'd like to know if it actually has helped anyone. Personally, after I wrote it I couldn't live without it.
