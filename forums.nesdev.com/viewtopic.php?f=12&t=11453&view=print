		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm almost certain he programmed the FlashROM directly. You probably don't *have* to desolder the chip to do this (<a href="http://hackaday.com/2010/12/24/reading-nand-flash-chips-without-removing-them/" class="postlink">example</a>), but it probably makes it a whole lot easier if you do.<br /><br />Nintendo Power carts are not just individual games: there's a boot menu in there that also handles all the mapping for the games. If you don't copy that (and likely, modify it for the game you want to run), then the mapper doesn't set anything up and it won't work. Your best bet would be to image a real Thracia 776 NP cart and then burn that image verbatim.<br /><br />I'm glad this thread exists. I've stated that I am unwilling to collect and/or dump any flash carts (BSX/NP) because they are basically USB sticks with a weird connector and raw file system. Now I have a link to show people.<br /><br />If nintendopower pulls this off, he can flip $20 eBay NP carts for $400 Wizardry 1-2-3 carts until the market catches on and all NP carts lose all their value, if he were so inclined. We already have eBay sellers reprogramming NSS carts thanks to nocash's info, so this is inevitable I suppose.<br /><br />I say we go ahead and do it. Reflashed NP would make a nice boot loader for my serial port controller, I keep wiping the SRAM on my current devcart and having to break out the Super UFO to rewrite it. (I guess I could dual-purpose quertymodo's Cx4 devcart though too.)<br /><br />As far as reprogramming a cart through SNES code ... the actual programming of the flash chips is almost certainly the usual 0xaa55-style commands for BS-X and GBA RAM. The flash vendor interfaces are usually very similar to each other, with a few minor tweaks. But there's probably some extra catch like a &quot;write enable&quot; register/sequence that the NP reprogramming stations performed via running its own boot ROM instead of booting directly off the cart. Unlikely it's anything super complicated like special voltages applied to pins that a regular SNES console can't do, to turn on reprogramming mode, although I guess we can't rule that out.<br /><br />Best bet to learn how to do this through cart swapping + reprogramming, would be to emulate the actual NP menu and memory mapping chip. Get a good idea of the register space involved, look for gaps in the register table, and start experimenting. Use the usual GBA RAM rewrite command style on it as you brute-force any kind of enable handshake.<br /><br />But hell, it may have no enable required at all. I don't think anyone's actually tried a straight up cart swap GBA-style reprogram before.

I used simple SHVC-1AxM-xx (LoRom) or SHVC-1JxM-xx (HiRom) donor boards from sports games and the like. Programmed the EPROMS (usually 27c801 or 27c322 with a few other decoders) and replaced the original MaskROM.<br /><br />That way I have made Genjuu Ryudan, Power Lode Runner and other NP games, like the Picross series. Not for sale though!<br /><br />I never had a NP Cartridge in my hands yet but I might buy one just to see how it works. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

LoROM and HiROM are not &quot;mappers&quot;. They are terms we use for two different memory models. Nintendo refers to them as &quot;Mode ##&quot;. They are not memory mappers in the sense like NES or SA-1/SDD-1 because they aren't capable of mapping anything on the fly. They are just a static setup of how the memory is mapped.<br /><br />Take Killer Instinct for example. This game consists of only two chips on a very small PCB. One 32 Megabit MaskROM and the Lockout/CIC chip. The game is &quot;HiROM&quot;. But there is no mapper involved. The game is &quot;HiROM&quot; because of what signals on the MaskROM connect to what signals on the cartridge port.

The  cart inside has the potential of 3 16mbit flash chips but only 2 of the flash roms are installed.   So it would seem that whatever can be programmed, couldn't be any bigger than 48mbits or total more than 48mbits.   DKC3 is a 32mbit game so that completely occupies the 2 flash roms on the cart.

If that is working, then there would be apparently only one single directory (in one of the FLASH chips) (technically, that might be possible: the MX15001 chip might be able to take control of the databus during /RESET, so it might be able to read the directory info from the FLASH chip, and then map the selected game accordingly) (of course that theory won't work for bigger 4Mbyte games which come up without any menu/directory).<br />Being pessimistic, I would suspect that swapping the FLASH chips won't work, and that the whole (de)-soldering work would just result in crashing right after selecting a game from the menu. And even if it would work: It wouldn't really on learning how to reprogram the cartridges without soldering.<br />    <br />The only way to learn how to reprogram the carts is probably hacking one of the offical programming stations. As by now there seems to be little known about them. Photos of their PCBs/chipset would be nice, and one would also need dumps of their storage memory, whatever they've been using there... ROM, EPROM, FLASH, HDDs?
