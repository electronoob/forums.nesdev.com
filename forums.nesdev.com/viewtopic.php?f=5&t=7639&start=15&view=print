<br />Probably because it sounds like ROM hacking, unauthorized stuff..? Gray area.

<br />
<br />Gray area? Please no! This is 100% new code, ain't it? This project is too awesome to stop. If you find no better way of extracting the levels, I'll see if I can lend a hand with the conversion process.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actionscript is just C-like curly brace syntax.  And variables don't need declaration, they automatically become members of the class or movie clip.  Undeclared variables that haven't been used yet return "undefined".
<br />
<br />So yeah, it's messy in that there's no explicit variable declaration, but the source code could easily be changed to C++ once you add in the variable declarations.
<br />
<br />Then Actionscript 3 comes out and everything gets turned on its head, it's a whole different beast.  I haven't seen any working free decompilers for AS3.  Plenty for AS1/2 though.

<br />Lode Runner's levels were also altered subtly to fit the smaller height of the NES playfield.
<br />
<br />If you have screenshots of all the levels, I could probably write a tool to convert the screenshots into usable maps that can be re-edited to fit the design into the NES. I really want to see this NES remake continued even if only to provide some continuity from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_52" class="postlink">point A</a> to <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=8514" class="postlink">point B</a>.

<br />Loved the BC parodies of the game, still gotta see if I can beat it playing as Proffessor Tary :)

<br />I too would love to see a NES port, if only to avoid being killed multiple times by browser lag...

<br />Yeah that would be nice, not sure if I can fit the game in NROM though (not really interested in trying to optimize it for just that reason).
