		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I really need some reverse engineering help, and I didn't know where to turn except here as I really admire many people's skills here.  However it is unrelated to the NES, and for this I appologize (Memblers, I do not plan to make this a habit and hope this one thread is an okay exception to have here).
<br />
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">The story:</span>
<br />I love to reverse engineer stuff, and most of my hobby time goes to such activities.  For some reason one simple device has really gotten stuck in the back of my mind.  I'm almost ashamed to say I've spent hundreds of dollars at this point trying to figure out this device, which even when solved would have no real practical value.  It is, and I assume some here will understand completely, the challenge itself that makes it fun.  But like any puzzle that gets stuck in the back of your mind, this one is starting to gnaw at me and I really just want to "flip to the back of the book" and see the answer now.
<br />
<br />Due to the nature of this (the information can easily be abused), I would prefer to not release all details here.  So I will just word it this way, I saw an encrypted data storage device that I was pretty sure the company was lying about their security.  I found some flaws almost immediately.  Talking to the company raised all kinds of trouble, and asking even simple questions like "does your device have any security besides obscurity" led to them threatenning me.  Yeah, these guys know they are hiding something.
<br />
<br />It is this project which was always drifting in the back of my mind that actually led to me learning new techniques (for example reading ROM and circuitry  directly from IC chips, learning about the code and operations being ran by carefully watching the current a chip takes, etc.)  which has undoubtedly helped in other "real" projects.  (Yeah, this has been going on for years.)
<br />
<br />In fact I've had so much fun with some of these techniques that I got side tracked with them.  A couple months ago I returned to this project to finish up some more routine reverse engineering work on it (which I should have done in the first place) and figured out how to _completely_ bypass the security.  So in a sense I finally won.  But not really... the fun was trying to crack it, and that just side stepped the real question.
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Here is the question:</span>
<br />At one point, the device asks a 32bit challenge, and the other side must authenticate by responding with a correct 32bit response.  Due to figuring out how to bypass all this, I can get as many challenge-&gt;response pairs as I want (well, it takes on the order of a second to do... so I can't just crank out all 4 billion, and also the EEPROM starts to fail after getting about 100k responses).  But I am getting these by tricking the device into giving me the answer, and I do not know the actual algorithm.  The question is then: What is the algorithm? And the more fun rewording is How can I figure out this algorithm?
<br />
<br /><em>It is the classic black box challenge!</em>
<br />Something goes in, something else comes out ... can you craft the attempts well enough to learn what is going on in the box?
<br />
<br />There are only a couple little bits of extra information.  In addition to the 32bit challenge there are, let's just call them "channel IDs".  With a different channel ID, the response to the challenge changes.  So this algorithm must also be easily modified with some extra information.  I cannot freely change these "channel IDs", which has a 16bit "main ID", and 4bit "sub ID".  The very fact that the algorithm must be able to easily change is useful information.
<br />
<br />And finally, the device runs at 1MHz, and doesn't take all that much time to process stuff (I can try to give some numbers if you really want) and therefore this algorithm isn't anything heavy duty.  I do not know if the device CPU has a hardware multiplier or not.  This company seems to have done everything very "homebrew", as if they just asked an undergrad engineer to make up something.  So while they may have grabbed some known random number generators, or borrowed some code, they definitely didn't use the latest and greatest of any security protocal or followed any standards.
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">The public challenge / reward:</span>
<br />If anyone finds a classic black box challenge interesting, I'd love to work with people on this.
<br />
<br />Give me inputs (challenges) and I'll give you the outputs (the correct response from the algorithm).  Any ideas for strategy here would be helpful.
<br />
<br />Since I really just want to find the answer at this point, I'll gladly give a couple hundred dollar reward or buy someone a Wii or something as a prize for solving the black box if you wish (would a NES flash cart be a more appropriate prize for this board? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ).  Feel free to pass this on to other places where hardware/software knowledgeable people gather.

<br />The responses do not depend on "past information".  How the device is supposed to work in real life, it can't either.  As whoever it is doing the authentication challenge/response with this time may be someone completely different next time.  The entire "state" is given with that ID (which I can't freely change) and the 32-bit challenge.
<br />
<br />I double checked by rerunning one of those data sets above and comparing to the original... absolutely no differences.
<br />
<br />This simplifies the "black box" some.  Somethine goes in, something comes out.  And it is completely repeatible and (in principle) predictable, otherwise it would defeat the purpose which is kind of like a secret knock (one side says a challenge, and the other responds... they need to agree on the algorithm completely to know the correct answer).

<br />
<br />Here is an interesting tidbit.  If I do a fourier transform on ID00070_counting.csv, I see a comb like structure.
<br /><img src="http://www.neviksti.com/blackbox/ID00070_fourier.gif" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />
<br />I'm not sure what that means. Is that a signature of any known algorithm?
<br />
<br />If I do this for all the "counting" files, and pick off the largest frequency component (besides the dc spike), I see:
<br />ID00070  --&gt; freq=85.3295
<br />ID00071  --&gt; freq=84.9182
<br />
<br />picking off some of the larger frequencies for the 64k count file
<br />(there are peaks, and some structure in the specture, but I don't see a clear comb structure over these lengths) 
<br />ID00072  --&gt;
<br />freq=3.2
<br />freq=10023.6
<br />freq=26523.4
<br />freq=5.33334
<br />freq=18778.6
<br />freq=2.66713
<br />freq=2.66666
<br />freq=42.5895
<br />freq=50.9654
<br />
<br />
<br />However, I DO see clear structure just looking at the output itself over this much data.  Check this out:
<br /><img src="http://www.neviksti.com/blackbox/ID00072_counting.gif" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />I got one of those "blocks" in the ID00070_counting data, which may be why I got such a comb looking structure in the frequency spectrum.
<br />
<br />Any ideas people?  Are there any CS majors that recognize some of this? (There is a whole subfield of trying to get great "pseudo randomness" and testing the "quality" of such "randomness".  If any of you have a professor that may be knowledgeable in such a subfield, please do ask him/her their opinion on these structures.)

<br />Unfortunately I don't have much control over the "channel IDs".  I accidentally tricked the device into switching this once (that is how I got the ID00078 file), and that was only because the EEPROM was failing and somehow thought that "channel" was "enabled" for a split second.  Luckily it gave me the info I needed to bypass that channel's security as well.  I have not been lucky in repeating this "glitch" with other channels (actually that device died entirely, and I had to get another one ... and yes, the challenge-&gt;response pairs are constant across devices with the same "channel IDs").  The devices have a 16bit "main channel ID", and can hold data in 12 "sub channels" (the "sub ID" is 4bit, but two are "forbidden/invalid", and two are a means just to hold the device's supposedly unique "device ID"... I have also figured out how to bypass security on these last two "channels", but they both give the same challenge-&gt;response, and since they weren't actually meant to be used for data holding unlike the other "channels" I'm not sure how similar the algorithm details are for those channels and so haven't given logs for them).
<br />
<br />I've started collecting these things and a few friends have sent me some that contain other IDs.  I have a feeling they all use the same algorithm just with a different "secret key or seed" which may just be looked up in a table.
<br />
<br />If we're lucky enough maybe I'll find some challenges in different IDs which give the same response ... and then maybe it will be a bit more clear how the algorithm is modified.  Who knows.

I guess I'm giving away some more information now, but this device is used by many companies.  They don't want a person with one of these devices to be able to "get access" to another company's "systems" that this device works with.  Hmmm... that makes this device sound more important than it is.  It really isn't, I wish I could choose better words for this.<br /><br />Anyway, that is why I can't change the channel ID's.

<br />The device, besides connectors, is solely an asic with cpu, rom, and eeprom on chip.  The rom is nand rom, the kind I have not learned to stain and read directly from the diffusion layer silicon yet.  Also, there is enough rom that reading it this way would be very very painful anyway.  The eeprom just stores the data and probably other settings related to each "sub channel", and there is no access to it externally.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I've spent the last couple days running a very long string of more data.
<br />Here's a new main channel ID, with challenges $00000000-$0004FFFF.

<br />
<br />I have yet to see two challenges in the same "channel ID" give the same output.  Thus, so far, the algorithm is fairly one-to-one.
<br />
<br />However, between "channel IDs" I've found some challenges give the same response.  This may give a hint of how the algorithm is modified slightly for each "channel ID".

<br />
<br />Hi, neviksti; i'm glad to hear from you again. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I'm interested on this; indeed, you are doing what i was desiring to do with *another* encryption device, so i feel motivated to this. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />I have just read the thread, and i still have to take a look at the files and all that but , as first questions.... 
<br />is it out of the question to obtain a full (8 GiB) table for a certain ID?
<br />do you know if the challenge-response function is biyective?
<br />
<br />I will be able to say something more constructive when i take a serious look at the files.
<br />
<br />Andreas.

<br />Wow, thank you for taking a look at this! It is good to hear from you again.
<br />
<br />In answer to your questions: No, it is not feasible to obtain all 2^32 possible responses for a certain ID for two reasons. One being time, as it currently takes roughly 1 sec per transaction (although I can probably speed this up some, and I could always buy multiple devices).  The second reason is that the device rewrites some EEPROM during every access.  This limits us to ~ 1 million attempts before it starts flaking out on us.  It really wasn't meant to handle that many transactions.
<br />
<br />As for your second question, after collecting responses from 2^19 different inputs on one ID, I did not see a single repeated response.  So yes, the input-&gt;output mapping does appear to be one-to-one so far (but I cannot say so conclusively).  Because of this, and the need for the application to easily change the algorithm for different "channel IDs", we may be working with a block cipher.
<br />
<br />
<br />I am not very familiar with block ciphers, but have read up on their basic operation and some methods for cryptanalysis.  But all methods I've read so far assume the base algorithm is known ... and only the key needs to be found.  We don't even know the base algorithm (or even for certain that it is a block cipher).
<br />
<br />I measured the current the chip uses carefully while it is calculating the answer, hoping to see a loop (and let me count the number of rounds in the block cipher).  With the equipment I have, this is a big pain in the ass, and have only taken the time to measure the current readings during a full calculation once so far.  I don't see a clear loop pattern in the data. (but there are some similar structures that reappear at times)
<br />
<br />When it is I/O polling I see a very clear 10 clock cycle loop, and I can see when it is writing to EEPROM.  Using knowledge learned from this, and assuming an 8bit microcontroller, I have been able to narrow down the possible microcontrollers greatly.  But I have not been able to identify it with assurity yet, however if I do I may be able to read the code from the current readings in the future (far off goal at this point).
<br />
<br />
<br />For an estimation of the complexity of the algorithm, it appears to use about 9000 clock cycles (~ 2000 instructions).
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />Here are the remaining data files to give a full 2^19 input-&gt;output pairs for ID004D0

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah. After taking a first look at some statistics, it really seems a block cipher. I'm guessing it could be a multi-round scheme, most probably a SP network or a Feistel network with a relatively low number of rounds. If we got a full table, i could confirm o discard the second case; in our case, it won't be so easy, but i have some ideas to try.
<br />
<br />I will work with the available data by now. If i feel the need of it, i will ask you more data.
<br />
<br />Of course, it's probable i will change my mind about this a number of times in the next days, so don't take me very seriously. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
