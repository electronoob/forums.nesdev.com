I dunno, I had this problem on two occasions and in between I switched solder, so I would tend to discount that. My current solder is 0.8mm &quot;super solder wire: the best quality solder&quot; 60% stuff they sold at the local electronics shop. The previous solder was Nexxtech &quot;rosin core solder for PC work&quot;, also 60% but 1.2mm diameter. If I leave the board with rosin spatter on it, it doesn't look so nice, but the board works fine.<br /><br />Light scrubbing with 99% isopropyl alcohol messes up the board for me. Heavy prolonged scrubbing cleans it back up. The stickiness seems to come after light use of alcohol, even if I do it on a clean looking corner of the board, so I'm not really sure the rosin is even a factor here. Anyhow, more alcohol and more scrubbing take it away again so everything is fine now. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I was actually only trying more alcohol because I wanted to verify that this was happening; so I was actually scrubbing a board really hard, trying to just see if I could wear away the solder mask entirely, and that's when I noticed the stickiness went away after a bit. Maybe there's some weird residue on top of the solder mask?<br /><br />If you guys hadn't asked a few questions I wouldn't have recovered these from the trash to try this! So, thanks everyone. This has saved me a fair bit of time and money.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Thu Aug 23, 2012 12:36 am</p><hr />

Are you using some new solder or something that you're not used to?  I think my similar experiences were when I've used some cheaper solder.  I'd put my money on the rosin/flux, but who knows.

Wow, all 12 boards came back to life. This is great.<br /><br />So... my solution was just to give them a really heavy toothbrush scrubbing front and back with the same alcohol, then a brief rinse with water, a quick pat with a cloth and a dry in front of a fan.<br /><br />All of them work now after doing this. Very strange.<br /><br />A lot of sticky residue came off on my fingers while doing this. A lot of the boards felt sticky after I started scrubbing, but eventually they all seemed to come clean. Very odd; I don't know -what- exactly I'm washing off (it doesn't seem to me that rosin should be the cause... but I dunno), but I'm glad this worked.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Wed Aug 22, 2012 11:03 pm</p><hr />

Hmm, now this is very interesting. I took a few of the non-functioning boards and gave them a thorough rescrubbing with the alcohol. The stickiness seems to have scrubbed away, and the boards have come back to life (has worked on 4 boards so far).<br /><br />So, that's good news. I'm glad you guys asked enough questions to get my interested enough to try this... hopefully I can recover the others too.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Wed Aug 22, 2012 10:27 pm</p><hr />

99%....   That might have something to do with it.  50/50 is probably more appropriate.

Honestly, I don't have an explanation for it. I'm just describing what I've seen. If I use 99% isopropyl alcohol on my repropak, it becomes sticky and no longer functions. That's all I know. I'm pretty content to just move on and not put alcohol on others in the future. I'd rather not spend 20 hours getting to the bottom of this when I could spend that time making working boards with fresh parts.<br /><br />As for continuity testing, I wouldn't say I've done a thorough test. The ohmmeter doesn't update quickly anything, and there's like 150 points of contact to test, so it's not like I can try every possible combination. As for whether my flux is weird... this has happened with two different rosin-core solders from different manufacturers. I kinda doubt there's anything special about the flux, but... who knows.<br /><br />Specifically what I did was dip a toothbrush in alcohol, then scrubbed the back of the board with it. After that I waved it dry and left it under a fan for a bit.<br /><br />I was really just wondering if anyone else has had this problem. It doesn't really make much sense to me that this would damage a PCB. Sounds like it hasn't happened to anyone else, though? Maybe this only happens to me and something else is going on.<br /><br />I could take one of my working boards and start giving it the alcohol treatment progressively to see when it fails, but I don't think I would find out anything interesting and I'd rather just have one more working board.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Wed Aug 22, 2012 7:55 pm</p><hr />

My guess is the clear coat or whatever the boards are finished with dissolves in the alcohol, and dries in a day or two.  Still doesnt really make sense that it would prevent the boards from working though.  Bunnyboy has recommended &quot;Myro&quot; for PCBs in the past, not sure if that's who he uses or not but it might help the investigation.<br /><br />For some reason I think I've had similar issues with some PCBs I've ordered elsewhere.  At the time I thought it was due to the flux not dissolving well in alcohol.  They worked fine though so I never thought much of it.<br /><br />The only thing that should be conductive on those boards is the copper...  It's possible the sticky mix is conductive, but if it's not enough to pick up with your ohmmeter on the highest setting then I doubt it's the problem.  I would try replacing all the roms and chips on the board, vice just resoldering possible bad roms.<br /><br />So just now I decided to pull one of my old repropaks out and see if I can find the same problem.  I applied a LOT of alcohol several times and never saw any such stickiness.  Are you sure your applying enough alcohol to fully dissolve and remove the solder flux?  Do you have some weird solder with bad flux? You could always try an alcohol bath and see if it improves or worsens since you're considering them trash.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Wed Aug 22, 2012 7:29 pm</p><hr />

This is such a weird thing, it doesn't make any sense to me... Before considering them a loss, try contacting bunnyboy on Irc. He seem usualy pretty busy but if I was manufacturing PCB to sell to hobbyist like he is, it's something I would be damn interested in hearing! If this is the case, I wpuld write a big notice in cap on the product page and in the manual. I hardly think you are alone cleaning pcb with rubbing alcohol, I do it all the time and I'm certain many other do the same as it's one of those thing that evaporate so fast. You're saying the boards we're assembled and tested before the cleaning took place? If they stopped working right after, and won'r work after they dried up for days I think it would be worth it to investigate as I do not see any logic behind it. If for sone reason the coating react with the isopropyl alcool, how could it even create such trouble? I understand your confusion as I'm at a loss here too.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4859">SkinnyV</a> — Wed Aug 22, 2012 7:16 pm</p><hr />

If isopropyl alcohol is going to destroy the PCB from contact, that's not okay as far as the PCB design goes. I've doused (turned-off and discharged) NES and SNES motherboards in alcohol as well as liberally applied it to cartridge PCBs that were properly manufactured with no such issues... it should evaporate on its own and be as if it was never there.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5314">mikejmoffitt</a> — Wed Aug 22, 2012 7:15 pm</p><hr />
