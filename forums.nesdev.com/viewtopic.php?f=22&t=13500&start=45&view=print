My next steps will be:<br />1) make the top three rows of the field stationary (never did this is a game before, reading Nerdy Nights to see how)<br />2) figure out why the screen still temporarily tweaks out when I write to the PPU<br /><br />I thought I was following a basic principle: wait for VBlank then make writes to the PPU during Vblank. The subroutines that are causing the tweaks are DrawArrow and DrawSpeed. You can see the quick glitches by navigating the menu and making adjustments to the wind speed or wind direction. The correct background tiles are being placed but always with a quick screen tweak. It almost seems like my JSR NMIwait 's aren't doing anything.<br /><br />Why is this still happening? Thanks for the advice.

I haven't used ASM6 for a large project, but I think it would go something like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.byte ; before any .org directive, define iNES header here, or just rip out your existing 16 byte header and .incbin it<br />.org $8000<br />; code here<br />.pad $FFFA<br />;vectors here, then it overflows to the next bank<br />.org $8000<br />; next bank's code<br />.pad $FFFA<br />;next bank's vectors<br /></div><br /><br />and so on.  When you gets to the CHR data, then of course the .org doesn't matter.  Just .incbin your CHR file, and it's all good as long as it started at the right offset.  I'm not sure how you'd want to handle your unused/blank PRG banks, if it was me I'd probably just make some kind of skeleton file and .include it repeatedly for each bank.  Or you could try just using a big .pad directive, I don't know if it'll take a larger than 16-bit address though, could try it.  Maybe someone else would have a better suggestion.<br /><br />The rest of the conversion should be simple text search-and-replace.  Changing indirect [ to ( and ] to ), and for local labels, . to @

It somehow looks cooler or more &quot;official&quot; in caps, but it's hardly worth any trouble.  Actually, looking at my current project, for PIC16, it's all in C except maybe 12 lines of assembly, and it looks like I had typed those asm opcodes in caps just for looks I guess, heheh.<br /><br />I always type constant values in caps though (expressions and stuff that are defined with EQU or = and such, often used for immediate # operands), it's always good practice to distinguish those from variables.
