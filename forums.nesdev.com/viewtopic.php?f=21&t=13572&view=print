The 3ds one looks pretty good to me. Out of curiosity, I was wondering how feasible it would be to take the RGB triplets and determine if Nintendo just picked colors that looked good, or if they actually converted the NTSC to RGB using the same methods as found at <a href="http://bisqwit.iki.fi/utils/nespalette.php" class="postlink">http://bisqwit.iki.fi/utils/nespalette.php</a> and <a href="http://drag.wootest.net/misc/palgen.html" class="postlink">http://drag.wootest.net/misc/palgen.html</a>. If the latter, does anyone with more familiarity with NTSC video and the math behind the conversion know which values of Hue, Saturation, Brightness, Contrast, and Gamma they used?<br /><br />Also, going through this board, I've read that someone along the line has ripped the palettes from the Animal Crossing NES emulators. I haven't been able to find it--can someone post a link to it? Thanks!

There's lots of reasons to use it. Why would someone working on an emulator at Nintendo want to do it differently? Using iNES makes it easier for them to test and compare against other emulators, which I'm sure they do. Creating a new format would be a waste of time for zero gain.<br /><br />The iNES header is not meta-data, it is required information about the contained game (more or less). The VC does have some additional metadata, stored elsewhere (e.g. those filenames in the SMS post you linked).

If they indeed took the shortcut that's downloading illegal ROMs, because it's easier/faster than going through the process of obtaining old binaries internally, do you think they would dedicate any time to studying how to make the most accurate palette?

From the moment Nintendo starts using it in their official releases, it becomes the official way to store NES games outside of a cartridge.

That would give you an easy way to compare it against other palettes. You should see the same patterns (i.e. 4 elliptical rings, some adjustment for saturation, etc.) and it would give you a good visual idea of how you could make more detailed comparisons from there.

I don't know of this happening, but if they were to release the NES Pac-Man for example, I would not blame them for changing the orangey-yellow to a full on bright yellow. (They wouldn't bother releasing the NAMCOT home version when the arcade one is available, but it is listed as an example).

There's a good reason why whenever games get altered they usually patch the ROMs instead of modifying the source code (even if the latter would have been easier).
