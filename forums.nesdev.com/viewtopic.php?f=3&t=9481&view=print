		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yet another scrolling issue. My emu is running most games really well these days, but the one old time favorite with a nasty scroll glitch is Maniac Mansion. It almost looks exactly like what an MMC3 game that uses the IRQ for scrolling would look like if the timing was way off, but I'm not sure what an MMC1 game like Maniac Mansion would do for this effect. Here's what's happening:<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SZfAo.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/whIg0.png" alt="Image" /><br />Basically the scroll cutoff is smack in the dead center of the play area, rather than above the action items at the bottom of the screen. Everything above that line scrolls and renders as you'd expect. It's pretty consistent, once you've reached the edge of the scrolling area it syncs up.<br /><br />Thanks guys!

Apparently Maniac Mansion waits for a sprite hit to detect the end of the text area at the top, changes the scroll, then uses a timed loop during the whole gameplay area, and finally changes the scroll again for the actions and items. It's only after this last split that the game logic begins.<br /><br />If the top split (which happens after the sprite 0 hit) is correct, there must be something off about the timing of your instructions that is causing the wait loop to finish way too early.<br /><br />I found it pretty interesting that such a small portion of the screen is actually used for computing game logic, while most of the time is spent just waiting. I guess that this kind of game doesn't need that much processing, which is why the developers got away with it.

Makes sense, I've been tackling PPU timing tests to see if I can iron this out but I've been ignoring CPU timing tests. I'll start repairing those and see if it improves.

That seems terribly inefficient, especially when you consider that MM is basically a port of the LucasArts SCUMM interpreter, making it even less efficient compared to a native game.

You should also take a look at several Rare games, since they tend to rely on accurate CPU timing as well.

I've been moving through getting the CPU timing tests to pass and as I get further along I'm seeing a lot of (sometimes) improved behavior. Not really surprising this is how it scrolls though. There's what, two or three spots in the entire game that are actually timing based? I never moved past the front door so I'd expect more weird behavior if I kept playing.

All functional CPU tests pass as well. Timing on the CPU is something I've largely ignored though, spent more time fixing that on the PPU.

That's easy enough to add to my automated tests, it's been so long I forgot that count was even in there. Been testing against Blargg's cpu_timing_test6. Thanks for the reminder!
