For those suggesting to use a dual monitor PCB on a single monitor cab.  Just rewire the single edge connector pins to the female dual harness of the single cab, and swap the bios at 8T with a single monitor bios.  The rest is the same.  <br /><br />Edit:  <br /><br />Thinking about it more, the bios sizes are different...it may be okay to go dual to single, but maybe not from single to dual... i should try with one of my cabs<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4532">skforty</a> — Wed Aug 25, 2010 2:42 pm</p><hr />

Another option I've seen a lot of is people just use a small lcd screen for the secondary screen.  Or you could do what 2600 suggests.  I'm still waiting for the hardware to arrive in the mail and I've never actually seen how it works which's why the only option coming to my head is a manual switch.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4533">Drakon</a> — Thu Aug 19, 2010 4:13 pm</p><hr />

If you'd want to get expansion sound entierely with the bottom connector (without any special hardware on the cart), you'd need to acess sound registers through a serial protocol via $4016 and $4017. That'd be perfectly possible, but you'd need to implement it yourself in your favourite open source emulators, and only games that were made to use this will use it.<br />I don't think it's possible to make the bottom connector respond to other register writes, or doing so will require a modified cartridge that re-route some adress/data lines to the general purpose expansion pins, and if you're doing that you might as well add audio hardware on cartridge and use the expansion connector just as a bridge to get audio working.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Aug 19, 2010 2:57 am</p><hr />

Thanks.  I already have one, but was hoping to pick up a backup main board for a bit cheaper although I may bid on that one.  I was hoping to find someone with a PCB they robbed the PPU from.  I've got a load of PPUs and don't really need that part.  BTW, the PPU is already socketed so no need to solder in a socket.  <br /><br />EDIT: Just looked at the EBAY ad again.  It is a Dual Monitor Board not a Single Monitor Board.<br /><br />For those wondering about the gun and Duck Hunt, IIRC, the gun takes the position of player 2.  I believe there is also a check on another bit that detects if the gun is there.  If it is not, the Vs. games makes an annoying "alarm" sound.  There is what I will call a rumor that Vs. Duck Hunt also comes in a different version that uses a different PPU, but I haven't seen proof of that yet.<br /><br />Vs. Tennis requires 2 PPUs.  The Vs board has basically 2 NES systems on it and Vs. Tennis requires both NES systems to run.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3385">2600</a> — Tue Aug 17, 2010 5:46 pm</p><hr />
