Audio enhancements are pretty unimpressive imo. I got this thing as a gift, my report is the edge connectors won't last the test of time like their original counterparts. A lot of people are reporting bent pins already within 3-4 days. I built some passthrough carts so I can insert a cart one time and just put my games into the piggybacked edge connector. It's working out pretty well, I gotta do the SNES and Famicom still but other than that the NES and Genesis slots have a layer of protection from poor quality of Hyperkin's choices in the slot. Strange as they pushed the release date up to fix issues with the edge connector pins and they still seem to remain. A lot of RMAs and generally frustrated customers. The Genesis slot is particularly tight, I can see that slot being a huge source of discomfort for consumers who've not worked around this.<br /><br />The video filters are like any emulator and I find that I prefer to just keep them off as well as their enhanced audio. The colours are inaccurate, as is the sound. Licensed game compatibility is not 100% like they touted and hack games are slowly getting some support. The only use i have for this thing is really convenience on my desk. I have 17 consoles over by my entertainment centre but sometimes I just want to sit at my computer and jam in some carts, so we'll see how it works in that capacity as I begin to put this thing through some full game plays. I don't think save game importing to the cart works either though the last firmware upgrade may have fixed this.<br /><br />Also pull your games out from the side too. Pulling from the top will just add to the stress of cart extraction.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6586">K_Devel</a> — Wed Jul 02, 2014 10:21 pm</p><hr />

That's probably why I've heard that Yoshi's Island graphics are made like they are, to counter DKC graphics (also honestly it's like the only thing that would look colorful enough in mode 0, which has four scroll planes but uses 2bpp graphics).<br /><br />Has anybody tested the sound from the Retron 5? If it's anything like Mega Drive emulators, expect the sound to be way off.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4526">Sik</a> — Fri Jun 27, 2014 8:34 pm</p><hr />

Why would you test stuff on a console that can barely recognize carts? As I see it, the only advantages of the Retron 5 are the slots for different types of carts (meaning you don't need to have a bunch of retro consoles plugged in) and the HDMI output, which make it pretty convenient for playing games in your living room. Unless the cart you want to play is a homebrew, bootleg, or any other kind of obscure cart.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Jun 27, 2014 9:07 am</p><hr />

I really don't like &quot;pre-rendered&quot; (so-to-speak) 3D on 2D consoles), and the mish-mash of colours and pre-anti-aliased edges make sharpness difficult to discern.<br /><br />That said, the top picture (from your NEC) has too much red tint in comparison to the Retron 5 -- however, what Nintendo/Rare actually intended visually is what matters, so for all I know that's how it really should look.  Or your NEC is just turning up the red too much when hooked up to a native SNES + RGB cable.<br /><br />Something more amusing would be, say, blargg's palette demo for the NES/Famicom, or if there's some kind of palette test/generator ROM for the SNES/SFC (maybe the Nintendo console test ROMs?) then that'd be worth trying too.<br /><br />The one game I always use for general &quot;visual testing&quot; because it looks stunning is Actraiser, specifically the first fighting stage, or alternately Gradius 3.  I know what it looks like on a SNES/SFC with an RGB hookup + RGB monitor, and I still have my Nintendo Power magazines which show the graphics (also in RGB, and with scanlines) as well.<br /><br />IMO, that Retron 5 device looks purely, plain and simple, as a &quot;convenience&quot; device, as in &quot;it supports lots of consoles and carts, does HDMI for easily hooking up to present-day TVs&quot;, but everything I keep seeing/reading seems to indicate wonky features where the driving force of the developers/inventors was &quot;make it work on present TV sets&quot; -- almost as if the dudes who made it weren't even around in classic console days and think that visual differences (like the ones you show in pictures) are an improvement.<br /><br />And no, I don't like scanlines on non-scanline displays (i.e. LCDs); they look fine on CRTs, but the &quot;fake scanline&quot; look through software/whatever looks like total shit.<br /><br />The visual quality of the results are disappointing (to me); if the SNES/SFC looks like that then I'm totally afraid to know what the NES/Famicom output looks like.<br /><br />So yeah, I see this thing as purely a convenience device, and I think that's cool + great, but classic consoles are exactly why I own a small 13&quot; CRT Sony WEGA monitor with composite + RF hookups...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Thu Jun 26, 2014 10:27 pm</p><hr />

I've read reviews mentioning filters.
