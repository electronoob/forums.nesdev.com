<br />I think that the deadline needs to be pushed back to at least April.  With no rules, no official deadline, it wouldn't make sense to honor the originally proposed Jan 1st deadline.
<br />
<br />Dain (nintendoage.com) said he would be willing to host a website in the <a href="http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&amp;threadid=36224" class="postlink">Nintendoage</a> thread.  We still need to hash out the deatils though.  Judging is a big deal, especially if there are going to be prizes.  Does there need to be different categories? Should the entries be designed for easy multicart use?  Keep in mind, that multicart sales will provide money for next years competition (and any material costs from this year).

<br />I just like it because it is simple.  We don't have to use it, (and I hope Sivak doesn't mind) but I might as well give it a shot since I have some time today.
<br />
<br /><strong>Edit:</strong>  Seems I no longer have a place to host files.  Jeroen, did Dain set you up with anything yet?  Send me a PM if you'd like to see what I've got, or if you want to temporarily host the files.

<br />I've sent Dain a message.  We'll see what he says.  If it doesn't work out I'll let you know. 
<br />
<br />Also, if we could hash out the competition details that would be nice.  Hopefully by the end of the week we can have everything set in stone and on the website.  
<br />Specifically:
<br /><ul>Dates<br />Prizes<br />Different categories?<br />Judges/Judging points</ul>

<br />
<br />I attempted to elicit a list of people working on compo entries a few months ago, and got only a few replies.

<br />I can also help with website design/coding/hosting if needed but not too interested in polishing the rules. I think the website should/could be a single page with logo on top and rules and submission form (or e-mail address). Doesn't need to be anything fancy.

<br />That's kind of what I've been trying to do, just to get the ball rolling and some solid rules in place.
<br />
<br />The website is simple, just working out the hosting details with Dain. How does "homebrewcomp.nintendoage.com" sound?
