Also, going with what rainwarrior said, &quot;classical&quot; could be loosely defined as any song with a lasting cultural influence long after it's creation. But regardless, it's up to Jedi QuestMaster whether or not my song qualifies.

I'm surprised that nobody ever pointed out to me that my &quot;Classic Chips&quot; album doesn't actually have anything from the classical music period on it.<br /><br />Yes, Bolero is a copyright problem.<br /><br />What legal complications do you think there are in producing an NES cartridge? (I'm aware of none.)<br /><br />Even if a cartridge had a legal problem, in what way would this alleviate the copyright issue with Bolero?<br /><br /><strong>[Mod note: Potential legal complications have been split to <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=11944" class="postlink">another topic</a>.]</strong>

But there's probably enough Beethoven to go around for any game style. I encourage you to buy a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beethoven-9-Symphonies-Ludwig-van/dp/B000001GBQ" class="postlink">Herbert von Karajan's recording of Beethoven's symphonies</a> and put it on repeat on your MP3 player. You can't use the recording in your own works, but you wouldn't want to anyway on a cartridge-based platform. It's more for finding snippets to arrange for your game.

You mean &quot;Classic Chips&quot; has no classical-c music, correct?</div><br /><br />The periods only have soft dates, and they overlap with individual composers usually being put in one or the other category during overlapping years. The end of the Classical period is particularly fuzzy, especially if you consider Beethoven as transitonal to Romantic (at least <a href="http://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Classical_Style.html?id=vGdcINvz9n4C" class="postlink">one author</a> has argued that he remained Classical while his contemporaries began to pursue Romantic music). There are some broad stylistic changes that trend through these times, and of course there are figures like C.P.E. Bach who sometimes gets called &quot;proto-classical&quot;, as his post-Baroque music directly incited a lot of what became the Classical style, but it never fully takes on that form.<br /><br />Yes, I had no &quot;classical-c&quot; music in my album, though on the first page if follow the link to Brezza's Bach French Suite No. 3 you may find a different &quot;classical C&quot;.<br /><br />I'm not sure I've ever seen anyone use your &quot;classical-b&quot; definition (since the word classical is confused enough, and when speaking of copyright usually you want precision), but yes, the public domain thing is an important distinction when you want to borrow music.
