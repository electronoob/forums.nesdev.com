<br />
<br />It would be great to modify the twin famicom so you could insert a cartridge and a disk, and have a program on the cart that uses the disk hardware to format the disk and rewrite it. This sounds like it'd be hard to do tough.
<br />
<br />The other option is to also buy a device who deals with those "quick disks" and deal with it. I don't know which devices uses them tough, nor if they would accept to rewrite FDS disks.

<br />But won't those be extinct soon too? I haven't used a floppy in ages, and I'm probably on my 3rd PC that doesn't have a flopy drive. I'm not sure how long those things are going to live.

<br />Assuming the BIOS, sound and IRQ generation hardware is all on the adapter, then yes I agree. I don't know how accurately the powerpak emulate those.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Unless you can make something extremely cheap somehow, the answer will always run back to the PowerPAK. The PowerPAK isn't the cheapest device, but it's very capable. Maybe if you wanted to make an FDS-like system, you could create a very stripped down sort of PowerPAK with a fixed mapper, BIOS, and functions to load from removable flash memory. 
<br />
<br />Perhaps if you choose your features wisely enough you could make something appealing to developers while still being cheap and worthwhile for games to be released for it. But with the 135$ PowerPAK you must make whatever it is for significantly less than that or else people won't see the point. Then there is the chicken/egg issue of no one besides developers will buy it until a developer makes some worthwhile games for it. 
<br />
<br />But if you manage to create something cheap enough but still capable of some nice games maybe you'll find a market for it. I suppose you don't need a whole lot of features. Your removable media could give developers more space than they will ever need. 
<br />
<br />Still seems like alot of IFs are involved. So you might have better luck cloning the FDS RAM Adapter and drive. And perhaps you could avoid legal issues by socketing the BIOS and letting people just order it on an EPROM from somewhere else.

I just thought about releasing a FDS version people could play on their powepak with extra audio, and this IS runnin on a real hardware, but not a real FDS so the audio and IRQ generation might behave slightly differently on the powerpak than on a real FDS, and that is the problem.

<br />I remember when that came out. Sucker was $50.
<br />
<br />FDS homebrew, from a hobbyist point of view, is a novelty in the least, simply due to the rarity of actual code operation in it's native location (on an FDS disk/in a RAM cart)...on the other hand, if someone was to make some sort of device that is a sit-in clone of the FDS RAM Cart that connected to a standard floppy drive, I'd probably build/buy one, for the sake of an alternative of the hassle of actually maintaining a real one.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A simple microcontroller circuit could surely emulate the disk drive (like FDSLoadr) using a SD card/USB host for storage. It's more of an "*shrug* why bother" thing since that Loopy emulated the FDS in the PowerPak. I don't see any reason to NOT try FDS homebrew, but I wouldn't seriously consider it for a game of mine for its lack of accessibility/interest, and because well, the actual hardware really is a pain to use.
