<br />Maybe, but I think the OP also just likes to rewire cards as well ;3

<br />
<br />Anyway, it looks like PR8 is supposed to be one of those "native tools", that require you to have the means to read/write the SRAM in order to be actually useful, even though they work just fine on common carts/consoles.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I <strong>never</strong> made any secret of PR8's requirements. It's not even a case of being able to retrieve the data from SRAM - PR8 essentially treats the 32K SRAM as an extension of main RAM, hence the requirement to include the error screen as people were trying to run it on <em>platforms</em> that didn't have 32K SRAM support. And then sending me emails saying "PR8 sounds all broken!?!?"
<br />
<br />Once blargg &amp; arfink's Munchausen cart gets released there'll be another way to run PR8 (and Pulsar and NTRQ) but until then, PowerPak is your best bet. It's stated <strong>explicitly</strong> in the manual.
<br />
<br />I think it's a noble effort if you want to attempt to make it run on a donor cart but don't publicly complain when it doesn't work. Well, of course, you're free to do what you like but I'll be sat here with my "I told you so" face on.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Having a notice is perfectly desirable. It just needs to be worded a bit more clearly: replace "EMULATOR" with something more general that applies to donor carts too. Here's something I whipped up at 18 lines, 28 characters per line:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">PR8 REQUIRES 32768 BYTES OF<br />RAM BUT ONLY 8192 BYTES ARE<br />AVAILABLE.<br /><br />IF YOU ARE USING AN EMULATOR<br />THEN IT DOES NOT SEEM TO<br />SUPPORT ROMS IN NES 2.0<br />FORMAT.&nbsp; PESTER THE AUTHOR<br />OF THE EMULATOR ABOUT NES<br />2.0.&nbsp; THE MANUAL LISTS SOME<br />COMPATIBLE EMULATORS.<br /><br />IF YOU ARE USING AN NES<br />DONOR CARTRIDGE THEN YOU<br />NEED TO REPLACE THE 6264<br />SRAM ON THE CARTRIDGE PCB<br />WITH A 62256 SRAM OR GET<br />A POWERPAK INSTEAD.<br /><br /></div>
<br />
<br />Another thing: Which emulator do you recommend for use on Linux? A copy of Windows to run Nestopia or Nintendulator, the emulators mentioned in the manual, is as expensive as a PowerPak. I tried compiling someone's patch to add Linux support to Nestopia, but the compiled program just froze when running an NROM game on my laptop.

<br />Linux? There's a good question. I have very little (no) experience on that platform (I haven't even really used a Windows platform for over 8 years now but at least I have some access to XP even if it's via a virtual machine).

<br />I'm using Nestopia on Ubuntu, it works pretty darn good. (Except for the sound thing, <a href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/cleanup-audio-jumble" class="postlink">it's a mess</a>) I do recall a few snags when I compiled the source.
<br />
<br />What distro/version are you using?

<br />This might be the way to go. I've actually never tried this (for NES emulators).
<br />
<br />The problem in and linux distro for games is always sound latency. There's work arounds, but no simple, elegant solutions. And that's why I still have an xp box waiting on the sidelines.

<br />I'm really sorry.
<br />I guess I rushed into running PR8 without RTFM, I was excited about having completed my working SNROM devcart and was runnning every mapper 1 .nes I had on hand to test it. I didn't mod the cart to use PR8, but after getting NTRQ on it with limited success, I figured it wouldn't hurt to try. the whole time I didn't realize that I was offending the maker of the program by plugging it through the wrong cart HW. 
<br />
<br />I actually mainly made it to run mapper 1 versions of 6502 that I had devved myself, but didn't have on hand. I will hereby cease and desist all unauthorized use of NTRQ and PR8. I apologize to the author for any prior misuse.
