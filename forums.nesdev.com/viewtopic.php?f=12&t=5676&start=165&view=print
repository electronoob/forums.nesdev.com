<br />
<br />I just want to make sure I can have access to necessary registers to write or store files to the memory card like a little hard drive when I want to. I like to use it for both as a device to run many game roms but also like a hard drive where if I throw in some sort of PDF file and was lucky to make a PDF reader program (speaking hypothetically) for the SNES and load it from the memory card and view it accordingly. 
<br />
<br />I also see the Super Everdrive which I am also interested in. I may get both, (might not be both at once) but still.
<br />
<br />I would want some level of support for that and not be absolutely locked to specific file extensions (of course certain spots like the menus will look for .smc files or .spc files or such but if i place my own FAT file manager/explorer to open &amp; close files within an "OS" like Contiki - that there is no hw barrier in the way of doing that. 
<br />
<br />I would like to be able to see read, write, erase, modify files and directories on the memory card within whatever OS/app. Of course with the obvious of - if you erase a file, you may lose it or for example, I have Contiki and a web browser running on the SNES and dl game ROMs from the internet from websites through an ethernet module connected via the Expansion connector. From the technical specs that I have read including the SNES Developer's Manual, it would be nice to get that worked out. It does look nice. Would be nice is that one could download the game roms and store it. Including creating directories and dl them to the spot on the CF or SD. 
<br />
<br />This does not all have to be built into the menu system of the PowerPak or Super Everdrive but the hw features (such as HW registers) necessary to control the CF or SD/MMC microcontroller - when needed or wanted.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, it would be expanding the SNES beyond just a Game Console. But then the Japanese SNES called Super Famicom (shorten for Family Computer) was its intent. 
<br />
<br />Factor in keyboard and Mouse and voila and lightpen....  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> 
<br />
<br />Through the networking side, features such as IRC and other stuff would be possible and Contiki already provides that and also FTP support which in turn is giving SNES users the ability to access files from other computers and devices over the network. 
<br />
<br />Contiki is lightweight enough so it seems to be doable for an SNES. It is for a C64. Just tweak out the GUI front-end with SNES quality gfx.
<br />
<br />Emulation in my perspective is for cross-platform prototyping and emulating these carts and an RR-NET ethernet module via the expansion port (which is virtually identical to an Amiga clock port.). The rest is "dumb" circuitry and providing second power and some some sort of means to stand up the SNES about 2"-3" (stable of course) so the module can be plugged in and not interfere with anything from a "mechanical" standpoint. Nothing super crazy.
<br />
<br />I'll probably start with Super Everdrive with the Contiki project and then tackle the solution with the Super PowerPak. I see both as great tools.
