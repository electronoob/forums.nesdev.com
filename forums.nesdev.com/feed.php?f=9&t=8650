@FARID: Niiice famicom, but it looks like a snes! o_O Also it's got 3 ports in the front? Where's the famicom disk reader? <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> or do you have an external for that?<br />Data 3 and Data 4 aren't sent over expansion port afaik. In order for them to send, I'd have to modify inside my Sharp Twin Famicom, right?<br /><br />@Tepples: Thank you for the informative answer. Do you think it's possible to get either four player modes working by modifying the 4score? If it is, then I think I'm going to try to focus getting it working with the japanese 4 player in 1st case. As I don't really own any 4player games yet. super v spike ball (eu) is borrowed from a friend.<br /><br />I've got super dodge ball (fami) incoming, so I've finally got some software to try this on.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5210">Elrinth</a> — Sat Feb 25, 2012 7:31 pm</p><hr />

The Famicom expansion controllers and the NES Four Score use different protocols, as you realized.<br /><br />The NES Four Score:<br /><ul><li>$4016 D0: player 1, then player 3, then signature </li><li>$4017 D0: player 2, then player 4, then signature </li></ul>The Famicom expansion controllers:<br /><ul><li>$4016 D0: player 1 </li><li>$4017 D0: player 2 </li><li>$4016 D1: player 3 </li><li>$4017 D1: player 4 </li></ul><br />Famicom games that don't support four players ordinarily allow player 1 to use either player 1's hardwired controller or player 3's detachable controller, and likewise for players 2 and 4. This might explain your behavior of player 3 controlling player 1.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Feb 24, 2012 6:46 am</p><hr />

Hi guys!<br /><br />I've got a Sharp Twin Famicom and I've successfully modified my PAL 4-score to allow me to plug it into my extension port and into the 4score two external controllers or supposedly a zapper in port 2 (can't test because I don't own a zapper, mine was lost in space and time). However! My question is about 4-player support: If and how it's possible to modify my 4score to get it working!?<br /><br />ericj over at famicomworld told me to ask around here to see if someone knows anything about it... Here's my thread and progress so far: <a href="http://www.famicomworld.com/forum/index.php?topic=4906.msg108165" class="postlink">http://www.famicomworld.com/forum/index.php?topic=4906.msg108165</a><br /><br />Currently my only game at disposal to try 4-player is Super Spike V'Ball (PAL). I did try it, but it doesn't allow me to choose 2v2. and playing 1v1 and putting controllers into third and fourth slot will only make player 1 and player 2 move... Obviously I figured as much as I'm basically sending same signal from both.<br /><br />Having read: <a href="http://nesdev.icequake.net/ffpa.txt" class="postlink">http://nesdev.icequake.net/ffpa.txt</a><br /><br />I saw that famicom games were programmed in one way, and nes games in another way. So my question is... Will I be able to somehow shift the bits coming from p3 and p4? Because according to that txt (if I understand it correctly), all data is sent over p1 and p2. even p3 and p4, just that the data is added to p1 and p2. p1 and p3 share the same clock and p2 and p4 share the same clock. I'd like to have it working for both japanese and european games ofc, but if one of them works, it's great.<br /><br />But I can't simply connect a cable between p1 and p3 data, because I'd be sending the exact same data. Pushing right on p3 would be the same as pushing right on p1, exact same data? Right? I'm not really great with this, but there should be some way without modifiying my Sharp Twin Famicom inside to get this working, or?<br /><br />According to a guy over here (look at bottom): <a href="http://www.assemblergames.com/forums/showthread.php?p=264070" class="postlink">http://www.assemblergames.com/forums/showthread.php?p=264070</a><br />I'd need to modify famicom expansion port inside my sharp twin famicom with some IC called: 74LS368 in order to create the proper signals for port 1. o_O<br /><br /><br />Please respond here and not over there! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5210">Elrinth</a> — Thu Feb 23, 2012 4:22 pm</p><hr />
