I can't get it out of my head, it just has a nice ring to it IMO, which is all that matters. But maybe that's just me.<br /><br />I guess you'll find yourself right along the lines of other Faux-German named games, which isn't a bad thing. Rosenkreuzstilette series comes to mind, especially some of their character and boss names sound downright ridiculous to German ears :D<br /><br />Although, thinking about it some more, &quot;Gretchen Gitarre&quot; would be a perfectly valid cartoon character/hero name, and not a bad one at that (again, memorable), so you really can't fight it.

Most of my neighbors had names like Gerkin and Baumgartner.<br /><br />I only took 1 semester of German in school, so I can barely order apfelstrudel.

You can use some characteristics of her on the game's star and get some free marketing by claiming it's a tribute... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  <br />There's also <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/victornascimento/provas-de-que-a-gretchen-foi-a-dona-da-internet-em-2016?utm_term=.hjW0RLoqg#.txk0aMqne" class="postlink">some memes</a> of her on the Internet wich can make the job easier and/or funnier. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br />But if possible, please, no!!

(although I'm impressed that you have ramps, they're truly a pain to do. And maybe once the character is animated it won't feel so jerky?)

A note that touches her head just stays there, you have to jump so that the note touches her body.
