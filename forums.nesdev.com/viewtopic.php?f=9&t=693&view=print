		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm designing a simple cart dumper, which might also work to program RAM carts or Flash carts.  I know all the games have been dumped, but it's a fun project anyway.  All the old dumpers I've seen use the parallel port, which is a little long in the tooth.  My newest machine doesn't even have UART's, so I decided to go with USB.  Plus I have some experience with USB, having developed a NES controller adapter a few years ago.
<br />Anyway, there are 72 pins on the cart, of which I figure 31 of them need to be interfaced to by my dumper.  I combined the PRG and CHR address and data buses, figuring I won't need to access them simultaneously.  I found a nice PIC micro which has USB, as well as 35 IO pins.  That means I don't even need latches to do this, just the one chip.  I think that leaves the final cost at around $30.
<br />Anyway, I wanted to double check my logic.  Below are the pins on the cart edge I plan to connect to my micro.  Did I leave any out that I will need?  I'm right on the edge of running out of IO's, so if I've missed anything I need to add some serial-&gt;parallel registers to reduce pin count.
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Cart Pins - name&nbsp; | MCU pin<br />13+29 - A0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | output 1<br />12+28 - A1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | output 2<br />11+27 - A2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | output 3<br />10+26 - A3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | output 4<br />09+25 - A4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | output 5<br />08+24 - A5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | output 6<br />07+23 - A6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | output 7<br />06+59 - A7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | output 8<br />05+60 - A8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | output 9<br />04+61 - A9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | output 10<br />03+63 - A10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| output 11<br />02+62 - A11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| output 12<br />39+64 - A12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| output 13<br />40+65 - A13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| output 14<br />41&nbsp; &nbsp; - A14&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| output 15<br />49+30 - D0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | i/o 1<br />48+31 - D1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | i/o 2<br />47+32 - D2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | i/o 3<br />46+33 - D3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | i/o 4<br />45+69 - D4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | i/o 5<br />44+68 - D5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | i/o 6<br />43+67 - D6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | i/o 7<br />42+66 - D7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | i/o 8<br />14&nbsp; &nbsp; - R/W&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| output 16<br />50&nbsp; &nbsp; - /PRG&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | output 17<br />15&nbsp; &nbsp; - /IRQ&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | output 18<br />38&nbsp; &nbsp; - PHI2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | output 19<br />37&nbsp; &nbsp; - CLK&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| output 20<br />56&nbsp; &nbsp; - /W&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | output 21<br />21&nbsp; &nbsp; - /R&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | output 22<br />58&nbsp; &nbsp; - /A13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | output 23<br />57&nbsp; &nbsp; - /VCS&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | &#40;not connected&#41;<br />22&nbsp; &nbsp; - VA10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | &#40;not connected&#41;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />So I think I can pull this off with 23 outputs, and 8 i/o's.  Did I miss anything that I need to dump a cart?  Or to load code into a SRAM cart? I didn't connect any CIC or expansion port pins, but I don't think I need them.  Thanks for any input, I'll post the schematic once I get it drawn up.

<br />Thanks Memblers, that was exactly the kind of info I need.  I literally have 1 I/O pin left, which makes me very nervous because it gives me no flexibility.  As much as I hate to do it, I think I'm going to add a three 74LS registers to hold the data and address buses, which will free up about a dozen I/O's.  Then I can connect the newly available I/O's to pins like the one you suggest, which may come in handy.
<br />The flash cart you are talking about... are you laying it out yourself, or modifying an existing cart?  I'd be interested in getting a flash cart to test/use with the CopyCart once it's done.  I've been thinking about making a NROM flash cart out of a SMB1 board, but haven't really put much thought into it.

<br />I'd suggest using a Rambus-style setup as used on the N64, GBA, and Nintendo DS cart buses. It will take four 74LS161 binary counters (set up as real binary counters, not just as a quad-D like in C*/U*/A*/G*ROM) and use 12 I/O pins (D0-D7, Clock, Count enable, /Load low byte, /Load high byte). It reuses the data bus, and you might be able to get away with reusing a clock or count enable output.
<br />
<br />The 74LS161 (<a href="http://www.aleeanne.org.uk/datasheets/datasheet2/74LS161.PDF" class="postlink">data sheet</a>) has 14 signals:
<br />D0-3
<br />Q0-3
<br />Clk
<br />/Clr
<br />/Load
<br />RCO (carry output)
<br />ENP (count enable 1)
<br />ENT (count enable 2; used as ripple carry input)
<br />
<br />Now you have 56 pins:
<br />D0-D15
<br />Q0-Q15
<br />Clk0-3
<br />/Clr0-3
<br />/Load0-3
<br />RCO0-3
<br />ENP0-3
<br />ENT0-3
<br />
<br />Run Clk0, /Load0, /Load2, and ENT0 to the I/O. Q0-Q15 go to the PRG and CHR address bus.
<br />
<br />To set up ripple-carry behavior that turns these into a virtual 16-bit counter, wire RCO0 to ENT1, RCO1 to ENT2, and RCO2 to ENT3. Then wire Clk1-3 to Clk0, as you'll be clocking all four counters at once. You probably won't be needing /Clr0-3 or ENP0-3 so just wire them to VCC.
<br />
<br />To allow the address buses to be loaded from the data bus in two 8-bit chunks, wire /Load1 to /Load0, /Load2 to /Load3, D0-D7 to the data bus, and D8-D15 to D0-D7.
<br />
<br />Congratulations; you've eliminated 12 address pins.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have the first revision of the CopyCart schematic done.  It's unfortunately hosted at ImageShack for now, so it won't be there forever.  I'll put it up on my web site soon.
<br />Anyway, I'd love to get some feedback on it.  I really would like to spot any issues before I start soldering.  As you can see, I still have about half a dozen IO's left.  I can't think of a good reason to connect them to the CIC or remaining expansion port pins, but I'd love to hear ideas.
<br />A brief overview of the schematic:
<br />- 72 pin connector to plug a NES cart into is on the far left
<br />- PIC18F445X micro, with USB support is the device in the middle
<br />- 16 bit register/counter to drive the Address buses is on the far right, as suggested by tepples.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img457.imageshack.us/img457/7317/copycartv12qr.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />I'm probably going to have some PCB's made, cause I don't want to wire all those buses by hand.  If anyone is interested, drop me a note and I'll get an idea of how many to order.  Remember that the board is useless until the following things happen:
<br />1. You populate it with devices!  Should be easy, they are all large DIP packages.
<br />2. The software is written.  This is going to be a few months still.  The embedded code isn't that hard, but I need to write PC code as well.
<br />3. Unless all you want to do is dump carts, you will need a RAM or Flash cart.

<br />Yes, it' should be pretty small when it's all said and done.  The first rev of the boards is 6" x 4".  That's pretty large, but it uses all DIP parts.  I may do another pass using SMT parts that will shrink it down considerably.   I think it would neat if I can get it to fit inside a modified NES cart shell.
<br />I did received the adapters, it's exactly what I needed.  The cartridges make a pretty tight fit in the socket, but it's way better than any other solution I had.  Thanks again for those, it helped out quite a bit.
