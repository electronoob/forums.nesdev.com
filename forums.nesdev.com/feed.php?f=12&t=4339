Ok, grab "Ucon64" for Windows, and follow the instructions for installation of the parallel port drivers. After that it's simple to send and receive roms. If it's saying "Linking" then it's waiting for the PC to talk to it. That's good. It can be hard to get it setup correctly to send the roms but if you read the readme it's easy.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Tue Aug 26, 2008 8:06 pm</p><hr />

Could anyone with knowledge about TSF3 please guide me what I should do now to get this *darn* thing to work?

And I use brand new floppy disks with it of course. To be a bit more clear, I have three floppy drives to switch between, and only one makes wierd noises when plugged in. So I really don't think there's anything wrong with the other two, but I have no idea what I'm doing wrong...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=302">DropDeadLegs</a> — Tue Aug 26, 2008 3:35 pm</p><hr />

I'm having some problems that I hope you'll be able to solve for me. I bought a Game Doctor SF7 a couple of weeks ago. It boots fine but it always says "INSERT DISK PLEASE" when I try to back up a game. I have tried with several different games and bought brand new floppy disks.<br /><br />I also have an older SF7 unit that I bought about 2 years ago. That one stopped working about a year ago (the disk drive started to make a loud buzzing noise when plugging in the power cord, and it didn't boot after that). Before that, it worked very fine and I backed up a lot of games with it. So I bought a brand new disk drive for it yesterday, and now it starts up and boots fine, but the same message with "INSERT DISK PLEASE" shows up EVERYTIME I try to back up any game there as well. I have tried switching the disk drives back and forth between the two units several times just to make sure... And sometimes it says "SRAM ERROR 1", but that seems to happen when the connectors don't fully connect.<br /> <br />Any ideas why this happens all the time? I have tried for more than a week now and can't seem to get it right.<br /> <br />Thanks in advance!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=302">DropDeadLegs</a> — Mon Aug 25, 2008 2:38 pm</p><hr />
