If I make a submission, I was going to subtly put a bee in the background.

I'm not even sure i can pull off a contribution, but i'd like to try. 'Still learning asm basics' is enough of a restriction for me, and i think this is more or less representative of the position of any newbie looking for a good opportunity to get into the scene.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@tepples<br /><br />What's the point in a 7k/8k restriction, when a CHR page alone takes 8kb (and neslib takes 4kb)?<br /><br />You can't really make a fun game with any art in 3kb, including a decompressor / procedural generator for the art. At that point it's more about asm wanking than making a game, IMHO (&quot;look at what I could do&quot; - that's fine, you're skilled, but 99% chance I won't want to play that).

Being a C coder, it is not really an option to me.<br /><br />Of course you can always trim neslib and only include what you need (I do it all the time to make lots of stuff fit in 32K!), but I guess that wouldn't be enough.<br /><br />Unless the 7Kb category means &quot;7Kb of PRG-ROM&quot; with a separate CHR-ROM.

My thought was that some people wanted categories smaller than NROM, and I didn't know if there were any hold-outs for people who still wanted something like that. The thought was that the best of the little games could have it's own award, even if that's just a label on the cart.<br /><br />Really, I'd rather see my second suggestion implemented than this one. This isn't even a category that I personally would try for. Just for clarification though, my thought was more of a focus on &quot;best&quot; rather than &quot;use of space&quot;. Also to encourage more releases on the cart by having a judging category that would inspire people to make short entries over the course of a weekend or so.
