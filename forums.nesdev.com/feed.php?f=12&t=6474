It won't be the quickest, but it'd probably be the most maintainable and easiest to debug, especially if you're not working alone and others have to deal with your code.  It'd also be the most compact.  The typical SNES game was 8mbits and if it was small enough to shoe-horn into a 4mbit ROM, they'd definitely try.  Having stuff like dedicated macros for all your sprite drawing, huge tables for quick lookups, unrolled loops for building tilemaps to update with the screen would eat up space in an 8mbit or 4mbit ROM very quickly.  Although with 32mbit or even 16mbit ROMs for free (including fastrom), there's really no reason why a homebrew programmer wouldn't take advantage of those to get enormous speedups.<br /><br />Some time back (November or something) I optimised SMW's tilemap building code which was a pretty poorly written loop that ran 32 times for each layer that had to be updated.  The unrolled versions took up about 20KB of code after trimming all the fat.  It ran much, much faster than the original and with some optimal memory layout by the original game it would've run even faster by getting the DP register in there.  But if I was trying to cram everything I could into an 8mbit ROM (or 4mbit in SMW's case) I wouldn't be trying that at all.  20KB just for one part of the game and there's many more to do after that.  SMW does actually make use of unrolled loops, although it only does it for one case and it's not even stored in ROM.  They just generated the code in RAM using a small routine in ROM.<br /><br />Giant tables, unrolled loops and all of that wouldn't really work when you're pressed for ROM space.  Although with 32mbit ROMs for free, there's no reason not to go that route in modern hacks or homebrew (with 8Mbyte possible with enhancement chips).  The performance gains are huge but may or may not worth it if you're paying for every megabit.  Having a functional, but not optimally coded game with more graphics or levels etc. probably would've been more appealing to a game developer depending on how much they're willing to spend.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3295">smkd</a> — Sun Jun 13, 2010 5:29 am</p><hr />

Case in point: If the original Contra (<em>not</em> Contra Force) and Recca run on an NES, a game like Gunstar Heroes could certainly run on a Super NES with fast ROM. The lack of MMC3-style bankswitching isn't much of a problem because you can just dump a 64-tile bank in with DMA copy and still have time for OAM DMA and nametable updates. It won't handle crazy mid-frame shit like in Cosmic Epsilon, but HyperZone demonstrates that Mode 7 reduces the need for that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Jun 12, 2010 9:17 am</p><hr />
