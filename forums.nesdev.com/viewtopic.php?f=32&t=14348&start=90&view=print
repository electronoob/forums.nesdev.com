One or two times you jump to the next screen and almost instantly run into an enemy. Other times, the enemy is placed in the most annoying and inconvenient location, like on a tiny platform that you must jump on. I haven't completed either game (it's on my 'to do list').

I couldn't have created this game without all of this, and I'm really grateful.<br /><br />It really boosts me to expand the game and release it on cartridge this year (hopefully).

Playing the entries during judging was legitimately fun, and the most fun I've had with an older console in a long time! <br /><br /><br />I'll add another request for the score breakdown - I'd really love more detailed information on what people liked/disliked. It would also be cool to see what people liked about other games.<br /><br /><br />I knew I didn't have one of the best games, (and honestly with the quality of the entries, I'm happy to have lost to a lot of them!) but I have to admit, I kinda thought my raw score would be a little higher than it was. The graphics in my entry weren't great, the music was hit-and-miss at best, and the writing was garbage, but I thought the gameplay was pretty solid. I guess I want to see if others felt the same way.<br /><br /><br />If anyone has direct feedback on Waddles, I'd love to see it. (Probably in its own thread) At this point, I don't think I'll be spending much more time on the game itself. I'd rather focus on figuring out what I could do better next time to make a game people actually want to play.<br /><br />Thanks to everyone involved for some much needed fun retro gaming.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When judging there were a few criteria I was judging for that didn't have their own category and got lumped into the overall score.  For me the biggest one was replay interest, and game depth.  Those both go hand in hand often times, but not necessarily.  In my mind a multiplayer game is best when relatively simple but presents an enjoyable group experience/competition.  Similarly a relatively short single screen game can have a high replay interest if it's sufficiently addictive and rewards me for beating my previous high score in even a simple way.  <br /><br />I'm not sure if it's worth considering those or other measurements as separate categories of judging in the future or not.  But it would have helped 'explain' to the entrant more specifically what it was getting marked on instead of a blanket &quot;overall&quot;.<br /><br />One thing I didn't fully understand when entering my scores was how the different judging categories had different ranges of possible marks.  I didn't realize till after I submitted my score that was probably a means of weighting some categories higher than others.<br /><br />I do have some notes I took on each entry, they're only my own but I'm planning to seek out each entries' thread and give them my feedback.  One idea for future judging might be to allow for a free form section where judges can submit feedback to each entrant.  Doing that in the judging would make short work for the judge to easily give their feedback and help the entrant know what was most appreciated about their game and perhaps what might need work.<br /><br />EDIT: one more thing I tried to take into consideration was how easily I was able to pick up the controller and play the game.  Sometimes little to no explanation is needed.  Other times providing tutorials or help menus is rather necessary and I appreciated when the developer took the time to insert them.  When I was left to stumble and figure things out for myself and the blurb provided no help as well, it was a little frustrating and might have affected the polish and completeness score, even though the game was well polished once I managed to figure out how to play.

(Plus, I'm actively soliciting feedback right now.)

By even submitting, you've scored higher than myself and leagues of others that didn't submit.<br /><br />I really wanted to take the time to do an aesthetic critique of each entry, but I've been preoccupied illustrating all of the packaging materials for another project.<br /><br />If any submitters would be interested in reading a constructive critique of their visuals, send me a PM, and I'll make the time for it. <br /><br />Otherwise, as a passionate fan of these competitions, who hasn't yet participated in one, I want to thank everyone for the work that you've put in to share these games with us.
