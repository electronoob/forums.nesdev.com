<br />
<br />Since that message from that new user (christineb1979), it felt fishy. Small message, just say "source code" and word "nes". It could have been some beginners that doesn't know how to ask things but just by the user name... I'm sorry to be too judgmental but with such a niche group, the chance that a user called that way is serious is quite low. And usually beginners just create their own threads so they can get more attention on that specific subject. My "heuristic" didn't fail me about spammers recently.
<br />
<br />So what is the next step then to prevent link spam or any other kind of spam? Now content about the nes or code is not enough to be not classed as a spammer unless the content is quite specific about the issue (i.e. I want nes code is not specific).  It's seems such an innocent mail but now that message will be indexed in search engines and nobody would have noticed at all unless someone else posted in that thread.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The spammers in question are human beings, commonly located in India or the Philippines (read: cheap labour regions).  In the case of the referenced post, the individual came from a Philippines network.
<br />
<br />These are actual companies with employees which traverse forums and other social environments, making accounts manually and then using advertising links in their posts -- or, they sell the username/password to a highest bidder who then uses it for nefarious purposes (usually spamming).
<br />
<br />This whole "market" exists because of captchas -- it defeats their purpose entirely since the employees all speak English (which is also why/how they're able to post something that sounds "relevant" to the forum at hand).
<br />
<br />On the Moderators section of this board, we (well, I) have been gradually banning all of of the network blocks as posts like the above arise.  They have a *lot* of netblocks, solely due to the shady nature of their companies, so it takes time.
<br />
<br />The only way to solve this problem is to turn the forum into register-only mode (meaning every new account made requires a human to review the application and accept or deny/ignore it) -- you know, like effectively what was done with the Wiki.
<br />
<br />Welcome to the Internet in 2010.
