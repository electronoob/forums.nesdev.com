		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi,
<br />I wqas asked to help with Polish translation of "Fantastic Adventures of Dizzy"
<br />Everything was going smoothly until I needed to expand ROM(English text was shorter than polish translation)So I expanded game from 256kb to 512kb.
<br />Game's mapper is mapper 71,Camerica.
<br />And when I give modifed ROM to tests It was reported as not working with Nestopia.Ok..the limit for Camerica is 256kb.ROM is working perfectly on other emulators,even nintendulator.
<br />Having 256kb limit in mind I decided to change mapper.
<br />MMC3 was choosed.
<br />Ok,everything is working and...wait?
<br />It's not working under Nestopia,again. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> 
<br />"How strange" I thought....It's working under other emulators (and real hardware...)
<br />OK...I changed mapper again...this time into VRC7(Has easier bank switch code)
<br />But,As you can guess it's not working under nestopia only.
<br />Anyone has an idea why?
<br />MMC3 and VRC7 can have max 512 kb PRG...And MMC3 version works on real hardware.
<br />Normally I would just forget about it, but...Most players in poland uses Nestopia.
<br />I know this is hardly related to development,but still...help <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />

<br />But it won't work under Fceu anymore.. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> (But works on other emus)

<br />Small offtop question:
<br />If Camerica and Unrom is almost the same....
<br />And I heard(san't remember where) UNROM has no IRQ.
<br />Then why Big nose freaks out stops working(intro works,but not main game) when I remove IRQ address?
<br />(When I change last 2 bytes at end of PRG to 00)
<br />"Big nose freaks out" is Camerica mapper.
<br />Nes dev wiki and disch doc's don't say anything about Camerica IRQ's

<br />The BRK instruction causes the CPU to jump to the address pointed by the IRQ vector, so if the game uses this instruction, changing the vector may cause it to crash. This is not the case with Big Nose Freaks Out though, it appears to be using actual IRQs generated by the APU. You know, even if the mapper doesn't have IRQs, the NES itself has a couple of ways to generate IRQs, only they are not meant for graphics, but for sound.

<br />
<br />Bignose Freaks Out and Bee 52 (at least.. might be others) use DPCM IRQ's for doing screen splitting tricks.   These two games traditionally didn't work on emulators for a very long time.  So removing the IRQ vector caused it to jump to 0000h which resulted in crashination.
<br />
<br />Also as was previously mentioned, BRK uses it too.
<br />
<br />As for your other problems, how did you expand the ROM to 512K?  Since the vectors sit at the top of the ROM, it's possible that maybe they weren't switched in right,  or the emulators assume default power-on banks (which is pretty deceptive, because most real hardware mappers do not assume power-on defaults... UNROM certainly doesn't.   This is why many mappers have a fixed bank at the end of ROM.   This way, it starts up in a known good state where code can run and init the rest of the bank registers).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In short words, there's absolutely no way of "removing" the IRQ by just overwriting the vector (address) with zeroes or other value, pretty silly. Indeed, perhaps a few titles don't have an IRQ subroutine, though you're just redirecting the neutral IRQ vector to garbage, as kevtris pointed out.
<br />
<br />I wonder...
<br />Why do you use 
<br />various lines 
<br />to write?
