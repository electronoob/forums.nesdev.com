Both are available on Romhacking.net under homebrew section...<br /><br />Paint or Draw, just a simple drawing game. You can choose from any color in the NES palette, and doodle on the screen.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.romhacking.net/homebrew/69/">http://www.romhacking.net/homebrew/69/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The other game is an action platformer, with 4 levels and bosses. Pretty simple, but it was my first NES game.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.romhacking.net/homebrew/68/">http://www.romhacking.net/homebrew/68/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Also, I just wrote the music and music engine for another (currently unnamed) game, that a friend of mine is programming. It will be a vertical scrolling space shooter.<br /><br />Hey, if anyone else out there needs someone to write music for their game, send me a message.<br /><br />Oh, and I wanted to thank everyone who contributed to the informational portions of nesdev - I learned 90% of NES programming from reading stuff on this page, and from reading old threads on this forum. The other 10% was from Nerdy Nights and a few others. I couldn't have done it without you.<br />.<br />.<br /><br /><br />Edit, July 20, 2016...<br />.<br />.<br />I'm putting the Vigilante Ninja 2 links here as well, to make it easier to search for...<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/pyxuxh0e98b3fq1/Vig2_Lv1.nes">http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/pyxu ... g2_Lv1.nes</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/n6skiq0j22jbgcq/Vig2_Lv2.nes">http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/n6sk ... g2_Lv2.nes</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/zow1zuhw207annh/Vig2_Lv3.nes">http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/zow1 ... g2_Lv3.nes</a><!-- m --><br /><br />3 level demo...<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/2ipv0bgxllf1z55/Vig2-DEMO.nes">http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/2ipv ... 2-DEMO.nes</a><!-- m --><br /><br />MANUAL...<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/dw5fnwh11he26xj/VigNinjaManual4.pdf">http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/dw5f ... anual4.pdf</a><!-- m -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was going through older posts and I just wanted to say I think you should develop the Vigilante game, it's quite nice!<br /><br />If it had more detailed animation/bg etc I think it would be a really great experience. There are some internal tweaks you could make, for example when you hold down the punch or jump button the character continually jumps or punches. <br /><br />I'm not sure how exactly it works on NES, but you should check the the user input in a way where you check for the buttons being pressed and see if they are different than the previous frame, this way you can see whether the button was pressed or held.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Interesting that you mention that, because I was thinking about redoing the vigilante game with much better graphics and better physics and moving enemies and all that. It could take me a few months. I'm also working on a space-shooter with a guy from the romhacking forum, currently.<br />Once I finish writing a data compression algorithm that buffers the data on one frame, writes it to the ppu on the next loop, and stores it somewhere in the RAM as collision data (see smb) - I'll start rewriting the core game engine. Also, going to add sprite 0 collision for a split screen at the top, maybe. Lots to do.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This took me all week, but I finally have a working engine!!<br /><br />I know it doesn't look like much, and only the R button works, but this is a functioning scrolling engine that does all these things...<br /><br />-fetch and uncompress data stream<br />-load it into RAM, 2 pages reserved for 2 nametables of metatiles (like SMB)<br />-load 2 columns of metatiles, and convert to 4 columns of tiles, buffer<br />-convert 2 metatile columns to 1 attribute table column, buffer<br />-and load the buffer and attributes to the nametable at the start of the next frame (every 8 scrolls R)<br />-without glitches or slowdown!<br /><br />And I added a split screen at the top, for more a detailed status bar. I'm not sure yet how I'm going to update the status bar, except maybe freeze the frame, update it with rendering off, and then turn back on. Because, I'm completely out of V-Blank time. In fact I had to unroll the 'load buffer to nametable' loop to get it to fit. I don't know if anyone out there cares to see a VERY EARLY demo of Vigilante Ninja 2...<br /><br />(LINK REMOVED, OLD)<br /><br />Note: all the graphics are dummy graphics, just to make sure the scrolling engine works. And I think I'm going to do the jumping like Contra, where if you press down+jump you jump down, and you can jump upwards through a platform without colliding.
