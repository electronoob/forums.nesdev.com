I'm trying to figure out a way to get a real NES too, to make everything even more reliable. I have 2 60-pin clones (nice clones, not those cheap NOAC things) and 1 clone that takes both kinds of carts (also a nice clone, looks similar to a NES on the inside, from the schematics I've seen). I couldn't find controllers that work with this one, so it isn't a good dev system. The other 2 would work well, but all 60-pin carts I have are glop top ones, so, no deal. I got a 72-to-62 pin adaptor from lik-sang but that sucks.<br /><br />So I figured out I need a real system before I get any EPROM programmer or emulator. That is so sad, I get no confidence at all from the systems I got. The 2 60-pin systems are great, new and all. But the other is old, rusty and previously owned by careless kids. Since I can only use 72-pin carts, I must get a good 72-pin system.<br /><br />I'll just see if I can get a real NES. The ones I found around here were too expensive, and thare were only 2.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Feb 03, 2006 8:37 am</p><hr />

Also, about ROM sockets I thought I'd mention another option.  That's to just use 2 sockets (one to solder to the cart, and another for the ROM chip to sit in.  Then plug the sockets together.  They come apart pretty easily that way (use a screwdriver or something lightly to pry it loose).  And if a pin bends, the only thing to be damaged is the little $0.15 socket.  Like this type:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://futurlec.com/Sockets/ICS28.shtml">http://futurlec.com/Sockets/ICS28.shtml</a><!-- m --><br /><br />That's what I'm doing on Squeedo right now, swapping chips so I can work on the BIOS' self-updating part.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Feb 03, 2006 4:52 am</p><hr />

Hey guys, take a look at the cart I got today:<br /><img src="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/p_surfari.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />This is a pirate cart of the game "Thrilla's Surfari". I haven't played the cart yet but played a rom of it and it's a crappy game. However, the ROMs in there have the names of EPROMs, right? 27C1000 would be 128KB, as the ines header describes for that game (8 16k pages of PRG and 16 8k pages of CHR). Does that mean I could just swap these ROMs with EPROMs (or the flashroms you told me about) without the need for any rewiring? That would make it much easier to build a devcart!<br /><br />Also, the ines header describes this as a MMC3 game. I don't know how/if the pirates are faking the MMC3 and if I can trust this to behave the same as an actual MMC3. What do you think? Is this board a good candidate for a devcart?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Feb 01, 2006 11:52 pm</p><hr />

Sivava was just fine when I bought my programmer from them.<br /><br />There was one flashrom that looked like it'd work for NROM and CNROM.  I think it was the AT29C256.  Every other one that I know of will need some rewiring.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Jan 31, 2006 12:47 pm</p><hr />

I sent them one, like, 6 days ago and nothing so far (EDIT: I checked again and got a response a few hours ago). The programmer you recommended is that one right on the first page (Willem EPROM Programmer PCB4.5C), right?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />It looks like none of my friends are travelling to or from Brazil soon. However, I have another idea. If they charge you taxes for the total value of the item... perhaps you can send it to me. I often do this for friends in Brazil. I can repackage it and take off the prices, send it in a small box and declare the value lower. Hopefully they will charge you less for it.<br /></div><br />I appreciate the offer, but I don't think it will help us much in the end. I think that orders of up to US$50 or US$60 don't get charged for taxes here (although that may vary). The EPROM programmer is bellow that price, so there is a chance I may get away without taxes. If I sent it to you we'd have 2 shipping fees and more unnecessary complication for us both. And in the end, even if the customs charge something I bet it will all still be cheaper than buying that other one I posted.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Try flashroms instead of EPROM's. NROM &amp; CNROM's require no rewiring. UNROM was easy for me, with only some rewiring needed.<br /></div><br />What are the part numbers for the flashroms, and what sizes are avaliable? I'd like to order a few that I can use with my NROM cart as soon as the programmer arrives. So I'd like to buy them along with the programmer, and hopefully <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sivava.com">www.sivava.com</a><!-- w --> has the kind I need. I'll want to include some ZIF sockets to the order too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Search for "ZIF socket 28 pin" or 32 pin on eBay. You'll need 28 pin rom's / sockets for NROM/CNROM and some others, and 32 pin for more complex and larger games/data.<br /></div><br />Can I use a larger socket with the NROM/CNROM carts or they must be 28 pins? I was thinking about buying 2 or 3 ZIF sockets. I'll surelly use one in a NROM board, but I'll probably try more exciting stuff for the others.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I was thinking of making a tutorial for making simple devcarts - based on my reading on nesdev and my (limited) experience. Since I'm still new, I understand how it helps to have tutorials.<br /></div><br />Yes, but after we learn we end up never making those tutorials... we always seem to have more important stuff to do! =) I wish I could write some programming tutorials for the beginners too, but my teaching skills suck.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />However, I would only make a tutorial for things that I'm 100% confident with (there are enough bad tutorials on the net already).<br /></div><br />100% agreed.
