		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In my sound engine, the way I've been silencing the triangle channel is by making two very quick writes to $4015: $0B and then $0F. Basically, I quickly flip the Triangle's 'enabled' bit off and then back on. So far, this seems to work fine in emulators, but I haven't been able to test it on hardware or anything. It *seems* to work just fine in that it does silence the triangle channel, without actually turning it off, but is this behavior reliable at all?
<br />
<br />Moreover, would this technique work with the squares and the noise channel as well?

<br />I tried that technique before I went with the 4015 technique, and the problem I had with it was that it wouldn't silence the triangle channel immediately (there'd be a semirandom delay before it actually silenced the channel), and as such, it wasn't an acceptable solution for me.
<br />
<br />but the 4015 technique I mentioned, it *does* work reliably on the hardware?

<br />
<br />My sound engine uses one set of code for channels 1-4. Triangle is treated almost like the pulse channels: $4008 = $00 for off and $Bx for on, so I can treat it just like a 50% duty wave on the pulse channel, except smoother and an octave lower. Just remember that when you turn it back on, you need to rewrite the high byte of the period.

<br />Writing $80 should turn the channel off immediately. I might be wrong, but I'm like 99% sure it does that, because any write with bit 7 set will load the lenght counter with the specified value, and if that's zero, then it's zero'd and the channel silcneces. When the bit 7 is clear I believe the lenght counter load itself on $4003 writes then decrease each tick - so write $00 to $4008 will work if it's followed by any $400b write.
<br />
<br />As tepples said, it's good to consider channel equals as much as possible. That's why you should one of the many techniques available to mute the channel - as long as it works and make your code simpler.
<br />
<br />Writing 0 then 1 to any $4015 bit will silent the channel (exept DPCM). Writing 0 force all lenght counters to 0, while writing 1 will just allow them to take any value for the next $4003/7/b/f write (n.b. those counters are rather useless I find).

<br />
<br />from blargg's APU ref:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">The Linear Counter serves as a second more-accurate duration counter for the<br />triangle channel. It contains a counter and an internal halt flag.<br /><br />Register $4008 contains a control flag and reload value:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; crrr rrrr&nbsp; &nbsp;control flag, reload value<br /><br />Note that the bit position for the control flag is also mapped to a flag in the<br />Length Counter.<br /><br />When register $400B is written to, the halt flag is set.<br /><br />When clocked by the frame sequencer, the following actions occur in order:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1&#41; If halt flag is set, set counter to reload value, otherwise if counter<br />is non-zero, decrement it.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2&#41; If control flag is clear, clear halt flag.<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Note that neither $4008 or $400B writes affect the Linear Counter directly.  They just affect various flags and a reload value.  The reload value is not moved to the actual counter until the next linear clock.
<br />
<br />That's why there's a delay.  The next linear clock may not be for another 1/60th of a second.
<br />
<br />Also there's no way to set the length counter to zero without disabling it(unless you artificially clock it several times with $4017 writes).
<br />
<br />So afaik, the only way to shut off the triange <em>right now</em> is to do what Drag is doing -- killing the length counter with a $4015 write.

<br />
<br />That's why I couldn't do the $4008 method, my music engine has a command to cut notes early, adding those gaps between the notes. This was mostly for the triangle channel, so having those gaps be randomly absent was unacceptable to me.
<br />
<br />The other method was to just set the period to $000, but that has the side effect of making the triangle channel pop, and /not working at all/ on the noise channel.
<br />
<br />Ok, I'm glad to know my $4015 method will work. The main reasoning behind the disable-then-enable-immediately idea was so I didn't need to keep track of the bits.
<br />
<br />For square 2, I could write $0D $0F, and then after that, I could write $0B $0F for the triangle channel, and the noise and square 1 channels would be unaffected, while the desired silencing of square 2 and triangle would be achieved, and I used only constants.
<br />
<br />If I recall correctly, I currently only do this for the triangle channel right now, but later when I do a complete rewrite of my music engine, I intend to spread this technique to all of the channels.
<br />
<br />However, if I were to add dpcm support to my engine (ugh), I'd need to keep track of the dpcm's bit, right? There's no other way to have the dpcm idle other than to have it turned off, right? Or would the "flip off and then back on" method work?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Once you add the DMC you'll want to minimize this as much as possible.  You'll also want to have the smallest possible window between the $4015 read and $4015 write.
<br />
<br />$4015.4 is the DMC enable bit.  If it transitions from a 0-&gt;1 state, the DMC is restarted, and if you write 0, the DMC stops.  So the only way to not interrupt the DMC if it is playing is to have 1-&gt;1.
<br />
<br />The problem is, when you read $4015.4, it is 1 if the DMC is playing, and 0 if it isn't playing.   So if the DMC stops playing after your read, but before you write -- you'll end up starting the DMC all over again (2 drum kicks instead of 1).
<br />
<br />Granted... the odds of this happening would be slim, but it's one of those bugs that will pop up out of nowhere one day... and might be very hard to diagnose.  (And borderline impossible to reproduce on command -- making debugging exceptionally difficult)
<br />
<br />I wouldn't recommend the $4015 approach for this very reason.  It's hard to avoid on the Tri, but I <em>definately</em> would avoid it for Squares and Noise, since they can be very easily silenced by setting their volume to 0.
<br />
<br />
<br />Another idea would be to artifically clock the length/linear counter with a $4017 write:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; silence the triangle<br />LDA #0<br />STA $4008&nbsp; &nbsp;; clear Linear counter control flag<br /><br />LDA __whatever__<br />STA $400B&nbsp; &nbsp;; set linear counter halt flag<br /><br />LDA #$80<br />STA $4017&nbsp; &nbsp;; enter 5-step mode<br /><br />&nbsp; ; tri is now silenced immediately &#40;after 1-2 CPU cycles&#41;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />This works because entering 5-step mode with the $4017 write clocks the linear counter immediately, which triggers the linear counter reload (setting the actual counter to 0, silencing the channel).
<br />
<br />In fact -- I suspect this is why many commercial games write $80 to $4017 every frame.
<br />
<br />Pros)
<br />- doesn't require $4015 usage, and therefore avoids DMC troubles
<br />
<br />Cons)
<br />- Disrupts the natural flow of the frame sequencer.  IE:  you can't really use sweep/decay/etc units for a duration any longer than 1 frame.
<br />- Can't use frame IRQs (who cares)
<br />- Really really old or lame emus might not support it (who cares)

If 1-&gt;0-&gt;1 on 4015.4 restarts the DMC sample, then I probably shouldn't use it for silencing the channel DMC channel. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />Though, is there any reason why I'd need to disable the DMC's bit in $4015? If the DMC silences itself after the sample is done playing, then that's probably all I'd need, since my music engine would ultimately only just *trigger* the samples on the DMC.
<br />
<br />I guess being able to stop the DMC would be useful if you wanted looping samples, but like Disch said, quicky toggling the DMC's $4015 bit off then on would only restart the sample, right?
