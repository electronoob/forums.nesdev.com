And recently, Sam Smith had to settle one for &quot;Stay with Me&quot; resembling &quot;I Won't Back Down&quot;. But another member of this forum thinks the risk of being made an example of like this is <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=174937#p174937" class="postlink">not a problem</a>.<br /><br />Are there common-sense steps that composers of music for new video games should take to protect themselves from this sort of lawsuit risk?

Don't purposely copy a song.<br /><br />To have a 0% chance of ever being sued over perceived similarities? Don't compose music.<br /><br />Sorry, I've got to go with RainWarrior on this one.

Really hope that this judgment gets reversed, but…IP law's pretty broken, and the fooAAs are unlikely to let it get fixed.<br /><br />And if you find you accidentally did, then fess up and offer to put it right, either by licensing it, getting stickers put on your games, releasing a new version with a different song (which creates a funny collector opportunity, but I digress)…<br /><br />Alternately, click-through EULA with &quot;indemnify and hold harmless&quot;, arbitration, and &quot;liability limited to amount paid to creator for product&quot; provisions [IANAL and don't actually recommend this, it's kind of horrible that one can do so].

Avoid standing in an open field during an electrical storm.. but even if you did it anyways, you're probably still not going to be hit.<br /><br />I guess if someone was just so uncomfortable with the risk, no matter how small it is, one could start a limited liability company.  Sounds like absolute overkill to me, though.
