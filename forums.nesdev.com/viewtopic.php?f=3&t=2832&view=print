The patents on the NES technologies have expired, and an emulator doesn't contain any copyrighted code as the NES has no internal ROM (CIC excepted). There are hundreds of legally-distributable NES programs in the iNES format that can be run on a NES emulator.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, operating something without proper RF shielding can cause <em>actual</em> problems for other people, like interference with watching the daily mind-numbing content on television. Think of the couch potatoes!

<br />Yes, but the VCR manufacturers dont distribute them with the intention of them being used for such purposes. Take an umbrella, is it an offensive weapon? No. Modify it somehow (say sharpen the end), or carry one around with the intent to assualt, and it becomes one.

Someone needs to go through the GoodNES (PD) set and test everything against Nintendulator, Nestopia, and (if feasible) an NES devcart, and then report the results in <a href="http://nesdevwiki.ath.cx/index.php/Program_Compatibility" class="postlink">a page on Quietust's wiki</a>.

<br />Any emulator that includes a debugger, such as Nintendulator or FCEUXD, is explicitly intended for the testing of homebrew software under development. I would guess that "most" emulators (by number of projects) are hobby projects, but most actual users use one of a small number of emulators that were among the best of breed at time of installation (yes, at one point this did include Nesticle).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />But then why does every (current) emulator author struggle to get all games to run 100%? One might say that it's to make it as accurate as possible, since then it will be compatible with a very big library of software.
<br />
<br />Even then, the author is required to download hundreds of ROMs he doesn't own.
<br />
<br />I know we have to worry about the legality of what we do here so that we don't get in trouble from the simple hobby we all have here. But I have to admit that these discussions on legality can get quite ridiculous sometimes.
<br />
<br />If you don't want to get in trouble, better not talk about it at all. We all have done illegal things (related to emulation, at least) a few times, and will keep doing it, as this hobby of ours is in a sort of gray area. We of course mean no harm to Nintendo, and all we do is because we love their old system.
<br />
<br />Maybe this is a cultural thing, since many of you guys live in the US, the land where people sue the owner of a house for having tripped on a crack in their sidewalk, and you may fear that one day Nintendo decides to notice all of us.
<br />
<br />I think that trying to justify what we do as hard as some people do is a bit silly. We must admit (at least for our selves) that what we do might disagree with what the law says is right, but we're talking about a 20-year old console here, we aren't hurting anyone or making anyone loose money. The law should be worried about people that kill people, not this crap. In the end, I feel that the laws over this are silly.
<br />
<br />The internet was a major revolution on this world, and people better start getting used to it. It's not only emulation, people don't want to wait months before seeing new episodes of their favorite series, so they download the eps end give no ratings to the local network. Noone likes censored episodes either. People also don't like to wait for movies. People don't like to buy crappy games, so many download "testdrives" and if the game is not worth the money, they don't buy it.
<br />
<br />People better start thinking of new ways to do things, stop releasing products of sub-optimal quality (crappy Sonic 1 port for GBA, for example!), simultaneous releases of series and movies, if they don't want to lose money because of the internet. It's not like we live in a world where most people are rich, so most have to pick where to spend the money. It's no wonder that if one can pick a cheaper alternative, they will, unless the original offers some clear advantages, as should always be the case.
<br />
<br />Well, enough ranting. It just gets on my nerves when some keep insisting on justify what is done, in the weird way it's done here.

<br /><em>Full</em> what? o.O
<br /><em>Don't make a monkey of me.</em>
<br />
<br />Well, actually, what you call "emulator" is a PC program that runs NES2A03 (6502) software. It's NOT printed anywhere that's target for ROM downloading &amp; gameplay, but exactly the oppositive way. As blargg said, NES patents are gone and we do not use "illegal" development kits. So, even Realityman and his N64 emulator were hot topic someday... and now... is he in a jail? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Plus, the Nintendo itself is softing the blow. Just notice the ability of Wii of playing old games legally, or even the brand new Playstation3 / PSP able to play the old PSOne titles, come on! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />You can make as many copies of a book or just a part of a book you want for free, but you'll lose it's initial case. And since the photocopiers were invented the book indutry got used to it and don't have harm. It would be the same for the game industry, they just must be used that people could download games and get used to it. You cannot put everyone that uses photocopiers as criminal (and in a lot of cases it is to photocopy copyrighted content), and so you cannot put all people that play emulated games as criminals.
