		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been struggling for the past day or so trying to get a Star Fox 2 repro working on a Doom donor cart.<br /><br />I used a TSOP40 to DIP36 adapter from Buyicnow (the Type III one), and a AM29F080 I had spare to burn the game. I downloaded the rom image with the matching &quot;good&quot; MD5 as listed on the SF2 translation patch page on Romhacking.net, applied the patch, checked for a header via SNES purify, tested it in bsnes, and wired it up 1:1, since it was on an adapter board that matches the exact pinout of a normal SNES mask rom (and GSU roms, from what 3 or four sources say).<br /><br />However, it just will not flipping boot.<br /><br />I've checked the re-checked for bridges on the TSOP, replaced the TSOP, checked my solder points with a continuity tester, and nothing is bridged. The chip gets 5 Volts, and is grounded properly, /CE and /OE are tied to ground (CE originally was going to pin 20 on the GSU2 though? I tried it both ways. Neither worked.)<br /><br />I continuity tested every address and data line, and they all went to the GSU2, but the pins did not mesh with the pinout of the GSU2 mentioned here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.snescentral.com/0/0/7/0077/sf2_faq.txt">http://www.snescentral.com/0/0/7/0077/sf2_faq.txt</a><!-- m -->, so either I have a special board, or the document there is incorrect.<br />My copy of Doom even has the Korean SRAM found in Stunt Race FX, so it SHOULD be fine. (I removed it from a destroyed board)<br /><br />Regardless, when I put the game in my SNES, I get a black screen. My sony PVM says it's getting an RGB signal though.<br /><br />The board model is SHVC-1CB0N7S-01<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.snescentral.com/pcbboards.php?chip=SHVC-1CB0N7S-01">http://www.snescentral.com/pcbboards.ph ... 1CB0N7S-01</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Anyone have any suggestions?<br />Did I maybe fry the GSU2 with an errant static shock?

It boots reliably EVERY TIME.<br />So, I re-soldered the new wires on, and put a fresh TSOP, checked every pin for continuity and when I was convinced the soldering was perfect (no bridges, every pin goes either to ground, VCC, or the SuperFX2), I fixed them all in place with hot glue.<br /><br />I re-tested the wires, no bridging, and all wires have continuity from the TSOP pin to the superFX or the ground/VCC pins on the cart edge.<br /><br />I read the file off the TSOP package and, booted it in BSNES and played a vew missions. Everything SHOULD work.<br /><br />I put it in my SNES and get a black screen.<br />Great.<br /><br />Does Star Fox 2 not work on Doom, or does it not work via RGB?<br />I'm using 120ns flash roms, this should surely be fast enough for a 200ns slowrom?<br />Can someone give me the CRC32 of their patched Star Fox 2 rom that is known good and working on real hardware?<br /><br />I'm tearing out my damn hair here.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've run starfox2 on doom.  There are no issues with it or the game.    The stunt race is an easier conversion mostly because doom doesn't have the save circuitry.  And Dirt Trax doesn't have the save circuitry as well but it does have the 512k SRAM that SF2 needs.   In fact, you can get SF2 to run on any of the FX boards if you upgrade the SRAM size with a few jumpers.  I've done it.<br /><br />Here's my FX adapter.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://youtu.be/Qb99wXsS7_s">http://youtu.be/Qb99wXsS7_s</a><!-- m -->.  Go about 5 mins into the vid for the SF games.<br /><br />The smt mask rom is the same pinout as the dip mask roms except a few more power and grounds are added.  So if you wired your type 3 tsop adapter pin for pin, it should work.  Maybe you cooked your flash rom with all the soldering.   It's unlikely you damaged the FX pcb itself.  I would bet it's in your wiring or the flash rom is damaged.
