No reason to get rude there. &gt;_&gt;<br /><br />Yeah, just checked again. It's only USA and Japan releases. I'm in Europe. We don't have those boards. So I'm stuck with shell modding along with other European people who do not want to import USA games just for that to avoid shell modding.

But I want to say bootgood hasn't had all the titles I've found that use Konami boards.

This repack includes a mapper hack to BNROM, otherwise leaving the program unchanged.

Let me explain.<br /><br />For example, there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL" class="postlink">PAL standard</a>. It quietly sure describes all timings. You should keep it in mind, that CVBS transmits by serial manner. So, PAL standard describes:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Active video (D) in one line: 51.95 (+0.4/−0.1) µs<br />Vertical visible lines: 288 (576 total because of interlace)<br /></div><br />So, all devices that claim to support the PAL must comply with these rules. But we have two operating side: the signal source and the TV itself. TV also must comply with this rules, but only at CVBS input. What we see on the screen is completely depends on TV specific instance. Even if it is to similar models in same batch they can be different (by semiconductor parts, by CRT or something else). Thus, the television itself, and its final adjustment will mainly affect what you see. Since there is many of different kind TVs, TV crew invent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_area_(television)" class="postlink">Safe Area</a>.<br /><br />Back to subject. I captured CVBS from UA6538 by high speed ADC (@250MS/s) and build this picture (clickable, huge!):<br /><a href="http://hwm.us.to/famimusic/Upload/250MHz.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://savepic.ru/10170871.png" alt="Image" /></a><br />As you can see, it contains at least 3 full frames (fields). Black bar at left side is HSync. Gray level is a black level for picture (any sync must be darker that black). Also you can clearly see VSync between frames. And this picture completely comply with PAL standard.<br /><br />Conclusion. Your &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overscan" class="postlink">overscan</a>&quot; test in fact testing TV itself, because UA6538 PPU don't violate PAL standard. And you will get different result from TV to TV. The older will be the TV (or with malfunction), the less Safe Area you will see. I believe that it is fair and for NTSC.
