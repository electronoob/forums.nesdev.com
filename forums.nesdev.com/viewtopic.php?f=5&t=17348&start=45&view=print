At the low contrasts as used in this game, single-pixel-wide lines are hard to see over composite video.<br />2- The game varies its zoom; the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/0angFku.png" class="postlink">introduction</a> starts at a 10x nearest-neighbor zoom (192x108); the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/stAiavJ.png" class="postlink">first moment</a> of game play is instead a 8x nearest-neighbor zoom (240x135). The former is comparable to the resolution of the Intellivision, <strong>but</strong> the Intellivision only had a 15 color master palette, and extremely limited color coincidence. The latter is comparable to the NDS, but the field-of-view of the NDS's screen under typical play is maybe 1/4 of a TV or PC monitor. (Human vision cares about pixels per minute-of-arc, not pixels per inch)<br />3- It's not even maintaining a strict pixel grid, it's just using huge chunky pixels.<br /><br />It feels to me like trying use the &quot;retreaux&quot; aesthetic to achieve &quot;abstract&quot; but <strong>for me</strong> it falls flat, feels terribly lazy and cheapens the rest of the game. (CD quality sound but huge high color chunky pixels? FFFFFF)<br /><br />Regardless, this is extremely off-topic, so I'm not going to talk about this on this thread anymore.

I was wondering if you would be able to change their x coordinate in conjunction to their graphics pointer to eliminate this limitation.<br /></div>The graphics pointer is part of the Sprite DMA unit, not part of the sprite blitters.<br /><br />Before the active field, the sprite DMA unit fetches new values to be loaded into <a href="http://amigadev.elowar.com/read/ADCD_2.1/Hardware_Manual_guide/node00CE.html" class="postlink">SPRnCTL</a> and <a href="http://amigadev.elowar.com/read/ADCD_2.1/Hardware_Manual_guide/node00CD.html" class="postlink">SPRnPOS</a>. Before each scanline starts, sprite DMA fetches two words into <a href="http://amigadev.elowar.com/read/ADCD_2.1/Hardware_Manual_guide/node00C7.html" class="postlink">SPRnDATA and SPRnDATB</a>.<br /><br />Changing the pointer doesn't help (in the same way that changing the SNES's HDMA channels pointer during rendering doesn't help); sprite DMA still only runs once per scanline.<br /><br />To repeat a sprite within a scanline, you use the Copper to update the X/Y location in the SPRnPOS register. To update the tile graphics you have to send extra data to the SPRnDATA and SPRnDATB registers.<br /><br />And that's when you run out of bandwidth.<br /><br /><a href="http://coppershade.org/articles/AMIGA/Agnus/Copper:_Exact_WAIT_Timing/" class="postlink">This</a> gives lots of details, saying that you can get one Copper copy per 8 pixels when not colliding with other DMA, or one per 12 or 16 when colliding. Since each sprite can only cover 16 pixels, at least half of your available Copper bandwidth has to go to <strong>just</strong> uploading new values to SPRnPOS.<br /><br />The spritetapper archive shows that <a href="http://codetapper.com/amiga/sprite-tricks/brian-the-lion/" class="postlink">Brian The Lion</a> multiplexes sprite data as well as sprite X coordinate—but only 1bpp. There isn't enough time to do anything more.

It looks like Agony could have just gotten away with it instead of having to re render the background, but I guess not because sprites are used for the owl and the rain.<br /><br />Do you know of any Amiga games that actually render what could be considered an additional background layer using one bitmap (for a larger amount of colors), or is this just computationally impossible with reasonable performance (at least 25/30 fps)?

So While the 3D in the Overdrive 2 demo for the MD was good for the MD, watch some A500 demos. The line drawing and poly-filling hardware allow it to do some unique stuff. A few games let you morph your character because its actually vector. Anything that likes bitmap is going to favor the Amiga anything that works best with tiles will favor the SNES/MD. But it has the CPU as the MD, just it doesn't have a cheap char mode. Amiga invented the FMV <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> Also RAM, an A500 has at least 512K, 1MB is basically standard. 3MB is a rareish but not uncommon set up as well. <br />You can pull some fancy effects with bit-plane tricks, putting a shadow layer or colour inversion in the palette then move  single bitp-lane (shadow vectors). I would like to do the Donkey Kong Country Returns pure black foreground with colour background level idea on an Amiga. 1 bit-plane for the black, make half the palette black job done <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> Sprites for colour accents. <br /><br />It would be interesting to see what an A500 could do with a tile based video chip on the expansion bus, it would technically have the same CPU as the MD, but if you can keep full access to the RAM then it would really open up the taps, if you can genlock it with the bitmap hardware like the Picasso and Video toaster boards did, really really powerful.<br /><br />If you want better than MD and SNES then you need to go AGA so Amiga 1200 or 4000 or CD32
