		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I honestly think that's the kind of light tone that makes the better runs entertaining to watch. Some are a bit overused though, such as &quot;serious time&quot; about a boss that just requires you to sit in a corner and mash a button. It's all about execution though, I love the one at 4:28 in here <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://youtu.be/n4FmNdeP61A?t=4m28s">https://youtu.be/n4FmNdeP61A?t=4m28s</a><!-- m --> - especially how straight it's played until Blueglass points it out.

(Diablo II's run this year is outstanding for this reason, though few donations are read.) I am also impressed when a runner manages to perform amazing feats while also holding down the commentary stream the entire time (there were a few of these, but I can't recall which atm.)<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">serious time</div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_who_cried_wolf" class="postlink">Boy who Cried Wolf</a><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">&quot;serious time&quot; about a boss that just requires you to sit in a corner and mash a button.</div>Sometimes those can have something that can go Very Wrong, but if it doesn't, looks absolutely trivial. Or that it's not exactly the corner, requiring a precision setup. (Both, for instance, in one of the Bucky O'Hare bosses.)<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Often these are jokes, too (i.e., they mess something up and joke that it was intentional).</div> &quot;I meant to do that&quot; is very obviously a lie/joke.
