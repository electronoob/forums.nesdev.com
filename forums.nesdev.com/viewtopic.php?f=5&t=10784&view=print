On the left, is where you connect it to the socket.<br />On the right is where it goes 'out'. So that's where a 5V connection goes out.<br />The middle is something else completely.<br />That's if you want to plug something else into the socket, like a TV, to save space. You'll see what I mean later.<br />Pic 5 is the same, but a different angle. You can see where the fuse goes.<br /><br />On pic 6, there's a 4A fuse which is only used those 2 outputs on there. And that doesn't blow, so that's fine. That's not even used, really.<br /><br />Now, on the left, you can see the 'output' cord, where it outputs 5V 5A.<br />And on the right, &quot;AC IN 100V&quot;.<br /><br />And picture 7 and eight are is my makeshift PSU I'm using.<br /><br /><br /><br />When I bought it, it was apparently working(with a picture of it working)..<br />So I'm thinking perhaps whilst it was shipped, something could have been knocked out of place.<br /><br />Originally when I plugged it in, I didn't use a downstep converter... So that could have done something too? Perhaps blown a cap? (Very stupid thing to do, I know.)<br />Luckily it had the fuse in there, orelse the whole thing could have blown..!<br /><br /><br />I also made a makeshift PSU with a computer PSU by cutting an HDD power cable - <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://s.eeweb.com/members/extreme_circuits/blog/2013/04/24/pc-power-box-1366818559.gif">http://s.eeweb.com/members/extreme_circ ... 818559.gif</a><!-- m --> and powering the [broken] PSU straight from that, bypassing the fuse part..<br />It worked well, for the time being..

I'm not sure.<br /><br />But, I don't see any bulges in the caps. So they might be all good.<br /><br />I'm unsure as to how I can test whether it works without it being plugged into the second board, because it only turns on when I plug it in.. Perhaps you know a way to 'jump-start' it?<br /><br />EDIT: Ooo, I'm wrong. it turnson without being plugged in.<br />I'll debug it now!!<br /><br />EDIT v2: Yes, you're right.<br />When I plug it plug it all in, but don't plug the outbound transformer(red,blue,red) into the second board, it doesn't blow the fuse.<br />But when I plug it in, it does -- Even if I plug those two black cables into the plug next to the orange/black cap.
