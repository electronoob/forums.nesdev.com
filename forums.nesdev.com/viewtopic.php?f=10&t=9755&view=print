Perhaps single-threading?  A jump table?<br /><br />Are there any advantages to this technique?  I'm hoping that such a method would allow multiple games of the same cart.  Also, two separate threads could be used for split screen games wherein each player could be running a different game.

Perhaps single-threading?  A jump table?</div><br />Not sure either... A NES game would be single-threaded even without this technique, and a jump table table is just the mechanism to call the functions, but it doesn't describe the general idea at all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Are there any advantages to this technique?</div><br />Not sure. Most games already are basically a chain of different systems running one after the other, only they're executed in a hardwired order. The only advantages of shuffling the order of the tasks I can think of is completely skipping unnecessary tasks in certain parts of the game or reusing individual systems in different engines, but we can kinda do that already.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'm hoping that such a method would allow multiple games of the same cart.</div><br />I don't get it... You want to code some generic functions and chain them together in different ways in order to create different games?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also, two separate threads could be used for split screen games wherein each player could be running a different game.</div><br />I guess so, as long as you have the RAM to keep track of both games (and they were programmed to make use of relocatable variables).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's easier to store and work with an address than to store a gamestate variable. You can have substates that are also addresses, and just emulate a jsr indirect in place of say a jump table. This allows for saving of an address anywhere as well for a yield kind of functionality.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the replies, guys.  The idea is half-baked.  I'm thankful it got your attention.<br /><br />The main reason I was thinking about a list of sub-routines to jump to is not only for mini-games but RPG Maker use.  I could see storing the list in battery backed RAM.
