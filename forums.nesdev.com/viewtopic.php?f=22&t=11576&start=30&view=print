		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay. Few things I did with the free bytes that I had left from the optimized code (bank $00 in both SMB1 and SMB2J, with the exception of #2 &amp; 3.1 being in bank $02):<br /><br />1) Fixed an SFX glitch.<br /><br />2) Fixed the coin on the status bar during Victory Mode (credit for this goes to Nintendo's programmers, who had unused data present which fixes the issue)<br /><br />3.1) This is limited to SMB1 on Side A: Added more Bloopers to 9-3 to give it an even more authentic feel of FDS's Minus World (-3)<br /><br />3.2) This is for both SMB1 and SMB2J: Instead of using sunset palettes for Bonuses, I decided to revert them to original night and day ones (I left stages like 4-3 [SMB1] and 8-2 end, 8-3 &amp; A-3 [SMB2J] with sunset palettes). This has another effect; it fixes the oversight by Nintendo where they left 2-1 and C-1's Bonus as day in the original SMB2J (<a href="http://nesmaps.com/maps/SuperMarioBrothers2j/SuperMarioBros2jMap2-1.html" class="postlink">http://nesmaps.com/maps/SuperMarioBrothers2j/SuperMarioBros2jMap2-1.html</a> and <a href="http://nesmaps.com/maps/SuperMarioBrothers2j/SuperMarioBros2jMapC-1.html" class="postlink">http://nesmaps.com/maps/SuperMarioBrothers2j/SuperMarioBros2jMapC-1.html</a>). They now have their proper night palettes and the day ones have theirs. Nintendo either A) chose to make them all day because of lack of room or B) Forgot them.<br /><br />I've worked a long 40 hour week and I'm tired. So I'm releasing this in confidence that it is glitch free. Tomorrow is my day off. I plan on resting, so I will thoroughly test this by Monday. I'm releasing this early by my goodness and because I'm confident that I did everything right. --ShaneM<br /><br /><br /><br />SMB2J original ROM (65,000 bytes) CRC16 = BA55<br />My hacked SMB game CRC16 = 1E8C

This is due to incorrect data on my part. This has now been corrected.

It shows how closely I adhered to Minus World -3 of the original FDS SMB1. So you all can be confident that this is a fully stable build of BOTH games.

Since physics in my SMB1 are that of SMB2J, the demo action is off in timing. Also, when Hard Mode is initiated (after getting 8 stars) the demo would end early due to faster enemy movement. So what I did was fixed it.  I rerecorded new demo data using SMB Utility 1.08 (the newest one, since older ones were inaccurate with demo recording/timing...yep, this one supports joypads, too to ease recording/testing and yep it was recently translated into English, too: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/8564ztk" class="postlink">http://tinyurl.com/8564ztk</a>)<br /><br />Here is the new build/fix.<br /><br />SMB2J original ROM (65,000 bytes) CRC16 = BA55<br />My hacked SMB game CRC16 = 5EAE

After the midpoint there is an opportunity to get 5 lives in total if the shell would have made collision with the Piranhas. But because there isn't any, it only accumulates a total of up to two. I also find it weird that enemies such as Goombas create a static effect where them and the Piranhas blink upon contact when the Goombas go through them.<br /><br />Another level I can think of is 8-1 of SMB2J (Buzzy Beetle not colliding with an Upside Down Piranha midway, whether moving or stunned and then kicked). I'm sure there's more, just not off the top of my head. (I can look at NESmaps.com to find all.)<br /><br />EDIT: I just took a quick look and 4-1 in both games (Spiny causing static due to no collision when they go through Piranhas), 4-2 of SMB2J (shell at the end), 5-2 has both issues with the Red Troopa at the beginning and the potential kicked shell midway. Will look at SMB1 for levels, later.<br /><br />EDIT2: I still have to create a routine for collision if you all think it's a good idea, but SMB3 onward has collision and every known game after that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've further fixed collision bug with Piranha Plants as well as enemy code and enemy loading code.<br /><br />1.) Fixed Piranhas to have collision when touching enemies instead of being limited to shell collision.<br /><br />2.) Fixed bug with Piranha Plants and Upside Down Piranha Plants where they wouldn't load on many occasions. This is another Nintendo original glitch and has NOTHING to do with too many enemies being on the screen at once. Stages where this fix is most noticeable (but not limited to) are 5-1 (SMB1), 6-2 (SMB1), 8-1 (SMB2J), D-2 (SMB2J) etc.<br /><br />3.) Turns out there are actually 3 Goombas on 1-1 (SMB2J) where one never ever previously loaded (under any circumstances). This has now been corrected. Other enemy issues have been resolved, too. <br /><br />4.) I made a change to 3-1 where the end Red Koopa Troopas were previously on top of Piranha pipes. Since I added Piranha collision they would get caught in a loop. So I moved them a little after the pipes, into a &quot;Nintendo-logical&quot; place.<br /><br />This is really D-2. I just loaded it though A-1 to test it. It shows off shell to Upside Down Piranha collision. Points have been awarded for defeating them, too.<br /><img src="http://i1302.photobucket.com/albums/ag140/Shane_Mohammed/SuperMarioBros1amp2SRAMPlusJapan-Copy_001_zps2e09635e.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br /><br />Me showing off my newly-added enemy-to-Piranha collision.<br /><img src="http://i1302.photobucket.com/albums/ag140/Shane_Mohammed/SuperMarioBros1amp2SRAMPlusJapan_009_zps53fdd8f2.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://i1302.photobucket.com/albums/ag140/Shane_Mohammed/SuperMarioBros1amp2SRAMPlusJapan_005_zpsd424fb75.png" alt="Image" /> <br /><br /><br />All the enemies now load since I optimized the enemy slot buffer glitch. Here is 8-1 of SMB2J with the Upside Down Piranha Plant loading successfully for the first time!!! (Along with all enemies properly loading.)<br /><img src="http://i1302.photobucket.com/albums/ag140/Shane_Mohammed/SuperMarioBros1amp2SRAMPlusJapan_006_zpse7fbf1a6.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i1302.photobucket.com/albums/ag140/Shane_Mohammed/SuperMarioBros1amp2SRAMPlusJapan_007_zpsbfe287de.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />This is really one of the most comprehensive <em>SMB</em> hacks and most awesome *FDS* ported hack of this game. The fixes in this game are superior to any other official remake of this game including the GBC/SNES versions. This is how this is going to go down: <strong>The final deadline for this finished product is 10/12/14 for users to submit their suggestions on this game. After that, this will be a finished product. As of now, I've got nothing I can think of to make this game more sublime.</strong> (I can't add water/lava animation as I don't have enough free CHR RAM.)<br /><br />SMB2J original ROM (65,000 bytes) CRC16 = BA55<br />My hacked SMB game CRC16 = F7E4<br /><br />-<em><strong>ShaneM</strong></em>
