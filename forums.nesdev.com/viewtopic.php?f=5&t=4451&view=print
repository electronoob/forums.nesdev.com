<br />
<br />I'm one but let just say that it's quite hard to get access to any game from Japan. If you want to see one live, you have to watch it in the middle of the night and they're very selective on what they show. And during live event, they put their own commercial and doesn't stop it when the game comes back... So you can loose some important play.
<br />
<br />The easiest way it to just play video games around here <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />One year ago I was able to get them from the internet but recently I'm being too busy so I was not able to watch any, just the score.
<br />
<br />I'm a Patriots fan (duck) because I started to get interest into it recently, arround hmmm 2004 I guess?  My coworkers were footballs fan and decided one day to bring an xbox and played some Madden. 
<br />
<br />I had no interest in it but after watching them play, it seemed there was more strategy than just peoples hitting each other.  Since then, I started to watch.  
<br />
<br />When I started, it was already the finals so the first team I saw winning the super bowl was the Pat against the Eagle.
<br />
<br />I like that team but I like to watch any team play so it's not a big preference actually.  
<br />
<br />Let's see how they fare against the Chargers even thought Brad's injured.

<br />
<br />I saw that, what a nail biter. I didn't know Elam kicked for the Falcons untill that last one.
<br />
<br />I'm a 49ers fan myself and they blew a 4th quarter lead to the Eagles...I didn't get to see the game since it was blacked out. The local Cardinals beat the Cowboys, so that was a plus.

<br />LOL, lol, lol. I'd have to spread that joke arround, I'm pretty sure everyone will like it.
<br />
<br />Personally I think sports are a form of masochism, and encourage competition between individuals instead of making them friends, but I agree it's important to try to be on good health. This can be done by doing regular walking or biking and eating decent food in decent quantities, without having to rely on heavy sport treaning.

<br />
<br />But then you're not macho!   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> 
<br />
<br />I'm a former football player (REAL American football.)  Track and field, basketball, baseball, swimming (ugh!,) soccer when I was 5, and I think that's all.
<br />
<br />First born, my parents made me try everything.  Looking back it was a integral to my development because I'm very introverted.  Still am, but it forced me (aggravatingly) to be more social, learn about responsibility, hardwork, dedication.
<br />
<br />Football is the best sport.  Greatest team sport.  You are doing your assignment in order to help out all the other guys.  If one person fails, the whole play fails.  Same on defense.  The game is a war and every play is a battle.    
<br />
<br />I wouldn't be the same person if I hadn't played sports.
