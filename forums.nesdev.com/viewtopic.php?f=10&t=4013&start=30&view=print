<br />I once thought about using it too, but I ended up giving up on a few things, and settled for the MMC3. The background will not be as detailed as I'd like, and the sprites will not have as much animation, but it's still all good. The MMC5 is much more than a mapper, it is able to modify the console in so many ways, like in an attempt to make it less outdated.

<br />Well, then if you're experienced at programming CPLD/FPGA stuff (I'm not) you could implement a simpler MMC5 that is "compatible" with the real one, but that only allow scanline counter, multiply and PRG/CHR switches, but that lacks ExRAM ($5104 would always be $00) and that ignores special nametable modes ($5015 would be ANDed with $55), and also obviously lacks sound.
<br />You could also most likely run Castlevania III on such a mapper, since it doesn't use those features of the MMC5.
<br />
<br />I'm pretty sure that such a mapper would be able to emulate 99% of existing commercial games if they were proprely hacked to init the mapper proprely at reset, to have compatible IRQs and to adapt the timing on games that relies on timed mapper writes.
<br />
<br />If anyone is doing that, I'd then highly unrecommand relying on writes to registers that are implemented in the real MMC5 but unimplemented on this mini-MMC5 to not be taken, alse we'd end up with the same crap that already exists with the real MMC3 and the N109 that acts as a mini-MMC3.

I'd imagine seperating BG fetches from Sprite fetches is the hardest part.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'm pretty sure that such a mapper would be able to emulate 99% of existing commercial games if they were proprely hacked to init the mapper proprely at reset, to have compatible IRQs and to adapt the timing on games that relies on timed mapper writes.</div>
<br />
<br />I don't really see the point in hacking existing games to use a theoretical mapper (or even a real mapper, for that matter).  This kind of talk makes me think of the FFE mapper hack fiasco.
<br />
<br />I guess if you're talking about for ease of putting on a cart... but isn't that what the PowerPak is for?
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I actually wish I knew how to do this stuff.  I can't imagine that designing such a cart would be difficult... but it'd probably be expensive to build.

Oh, and nametable layout selection. I'd love this mapper, and would use it for all my projects.</div>
<br />The closest mapper to this would be Sunsoft's <a href="http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/nes_custom/NES_BTR.html" class="postlink">FME-7</a>.  It doesn't allow 8KB switching for the last PRG bank, though - but it allows ROM to be mapped to CPU $6000-$7FFF, something even MMC5 can't do.  Specifically, IRQs are triggered by CPU cycles instead of scanlines.  FME-7 appears to be supported by the PowerPak (it's marked good on the mapper table on the <a href="http://retrousb.com/index.php?productID=133" class="postlink">PowerPak website</a>).
<br />
<br />And in addition to using extended CHR banks (for the new 2nd Quest enemies), Castlevania III uses ExRAM as an extra nametable for the flooding water during stage 6B (the sunken city stage).  Akumajou Densetsu switches to horizontal mirroring (from vertical) when there's the flooding water, and clips the left side - including the status bar, which was stupid because it blanks out letters of the status bar (i.e. PLAYER becomes LAYER, SCORE becomes CORE, ENEMY becomes NEMY).  Konami took advantage of MMC5's ExRAM and managed to preserve the vertical mirroring and status bar during the flooding scenes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I did a couple mapper conversions to FME-7 and the mapper does seem quite nice. But that's again what I was talking about, a MMC3 level mapper. As it's already been said the MMC3 is like bottom of the barrel of MMC3 level mappers. Things like VRC4, FME-7, maybe Namco 106 don't have the limitations that MMC3 has. Gradius 2 was a great example of why the MMC3 sucks for its scanline counter that won't allow you to use sprites from the BG pattern table side. Yet obviously the VRC4 could do that.
<br />
<br />I think that there would be people interested in a new mapper with MMC3 level features. Even if it is just a clone of the MMC3, though because better than MMC3 would be nice. I guess just in general we can all dream up some nice features for new mappers. 
<br />
<br />One thing I had a thought about was if you have your mapper registers between $4020 and $4FFF, then you could map something to $5000 - $5FFF. More memory space is always handy. You could put extra RAM or even have a ROM swap bank there. Generally the space is just wasted. I'm sure there's some technical reason behind it.

<br />Yeah, I remember that now that you mention it. That's the only place the game use EXRAM it seems.
<br />Also, on a real TV I'm often unable to see the 'S' of Score even if it's not technically clipped, because it's hidden by the topright corner.
