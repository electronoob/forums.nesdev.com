		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Anybody know what methods assemblers compile opcodes with addressing modes and such in an assembler? Is it best to just sort it by Instruction-&gt;Addressing Modes-&gt;Value for the Opcode and Addressing mode like I was thinking of doing somehow or is best to code in the aaabbbcc encoding of the 6502 and then program for the exceptions? I'm really leaning to the 1st option, and just creating an array of all instructions, then look up if the addressing mode, then will finally lead to a byte value for the opcode. It's the easiest to extend and seems like it would just be simply the fastest way too. Oh well, just wanted to know other peoples ideas. There's more topics to come! Especially with the local labels and such.

Alternately you could get around this by using, say, MODE_ABSOLUTE for BRK, with an operand size of 1, but you'd need to handle that in the subroutine for handling MODE_ABSOLUTE.  Your call.<br /><br />You get the idea I hope.<br /><br />P.S. -- You're entering a very painful arena writing an assembler.  Prepare for massive amounts of string parsing and syntax pain.  Disassemblers = easier.  ;-)

Look into (god forbid I recommend this but...) sscanf() or if you want something better the PCRE library.<br /><br />You start by looking at the operand syntax provided and have to make some assumptions, then once you have a &quot;good idea&quot; what the mode is, you can iterate over the opcodes table (see previous post) and correlate the opcode + mode.<br /><br />I wrote what I did in my previous post with the knowledge of a disassembler in mind, and I imagine the same concept in general applies with an assembler, but you get to do a lot of string parsing, like I said.<br /><br />Alternately you could look at the source to asm6, which might blow your mind at how it does it.

That approach allows you to focus on the features instead of the parsing.<br /><br />That being said, my &quot;welcome to hell&quot; contribution would be: prepare for endless questions/complaints from users or potential users about why your assembler doesn't do things like NESASM, ASM6, CA65, WLA-DX, ...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I mean I don't think I will have that big of a hard time. You gotta look at the base contex clues to figure out the addressing modes in geenral and I don't believe that will be hard at all because I'm first going to parse the equations, pointers, etc. and then break them down to (Lets say we're working with LDA [ZPPointerVariable],Y) something like LDY [ZP],Y and then the assembler would just loop it up, and I'm honestly not worried about that anyway, I believe I can handle it and it won't be harder than writing the actual program for the assembler. I'm worried about efficiently storing and processing the addressing modes for the opcodes and then generating the byte that you need. I guess I will just be looking at the status. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />And honestly, I don't believe this will ever amount to anything amazing, I am more so a just wanting to try this to just see what it's like, and more for educational experience.
