<br />But this of course is completely pointless unless someone is actually making a game intended to run on a NES without SRAM.  Just use the RAM because emulators would gladly provide 8k of your computer's memory for your purposes.

<br />
<br />I say go for the memory expansion, depending on the game it's either 1983 style with 2kB, or 2009 style with as much as 512kB.

<br />It'll be far less of a flagrant Mario-clone than Giana Sisters. The idea is to provide a basis for development that's more legit than passing around IPS patches against SMB1.

<br />
<br />Common price for SRAM is about $1, 74HC139 maybe 0.20.  Rest of the cost is labor, inspection, stocking the parts, etc.
<br />
<br />Also, if you'd use enough boards, they should be cheaper than $4.  I've sold a lot of bare Squeedo PCBs for cheap, in larger batches though (50+).  But $4 a board, and 50 boards, is a good estimate for getting a custom layout (assuming no revisions needed).

Of course, this means you would only be able to do some minimal transfers during vblank, but I think many people seem to overlook that this can be a very usable alternative to PRG-RAM for any RAM that doesn't require frequent access.
<br />
<br />Then again, I can see Memblers point about cost of your own effort. It all comes down to why you want to keep away from PRG-RAM. To be able to sell lots of homebrews at a minimal price, or just for the challenge? :)

<br />This is a very interesting technique. However, how many mappers that actually have this feautre exists and are supported my most emulators ? Okay there is CPROM, but it has very limited PRG-ROM. I don't remember anything else, maybe some obscure famicom mapper. And using a mapper one just made up isn't really rom-hacking friendly.

<br />
<br />Most emulators are outdated, and if the goal is to get something on cart then it's irrelevant.  A hacker that can't switch emulators is probably not a very good hacker. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />When I say "SMB1 clone", I'm only talking about what I expect the engine to be capable of. I fully expect it to support other play styles. But in the following scene, notice the SMB1-style reuse of cloud tiles for bushes, and the familiar design of chimneys.

<br />Count me in too ! The last version of Nestopia makes screenshots MUCH wider than taller and the image is so distrorted it's not reconizable.
<br />And those graphics looks like they are not possible with the NES, lacking the traditionnal black common in all areas, altough I may be wrong.
<br />
<br />As long as there is pipes and coins, chances are that your game will be too close to SMB...
