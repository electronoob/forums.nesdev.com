		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />so lately when trying to make dev carts, they have all been playable, but scrambled.  I know it is not the wiring because it is happening to the NROM and CNROM games.  is it my programmer?  i have made many carts before with no problems, could it be dust getting in the programmer or something like that?  any help would be great.

<br />
<br />If it's an EPROM on the willem burner, make sure the VPP jumper is at the right voltage.  I had the wrong voltage when burning an OTP EPROM before, and the data came out with some corruption.  That was apparant as soon as it tried to verify it though.

<br />
<br />($0.02)
<br />
<br />Just a thought: have you tried swapping and programming your eeproms (use the PRG eeprom for CHR and vice-versa)  to see if its the one chip that is bad? If you get the same results, then its not a problem with the programmer.
<br />
<br />Also, (and I'm probably being dense about this) how do you know that the PRG ROM  is okay if you're getting scrambled graphics?  Maybe the PRG ROM is just a little less scambled, which would still implicate your programmer.
<br />
<br />Also, don't forget the simple stuff!  We've all seen this with standard carts in our toaster-loaders - you could just have dirty contacts on just the CHR ROM pins.

<br />
<br />Using the willem burner I think it does by default after programming (though there might be a way to disable it).  The way to check it manually is to load the data that should be in there, put the chip in the socket, then go to Action / Compare/verify.  If it verifies OK then it probably is the cart contacts or something.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i just remembered i moved my computer desk about a month ago and the programmer fell off, i wonder if that did something.  i didnt think anything of it at the time, but that might have done something.   i just cant remember if this problem started after it fell off.  but i always make sure that the eprom is verified or i dont use it.  if something was wrong with the programmer would it still verify and say it programmed the chip correctly?  i would think if something was wrong it would not work at all.  hmm, ill have to inspect the programmer to see if anything was damaged.

<br />Can you make a crc routine that reads from $2007?
