		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys. I know I made a post once about leaving and not coming back but, well I was wrong. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />Even though I finished the CPU of WedNESday a long time ago these are just a few points that I have yet to cover. The truth is that WedNESday is being absorbed into a multi-platform emulator and I want just 1 6502 core to serve all of the necessary platforms (Acorn Electron, NES etc.). So what I am developing is a generic 6502 core which has the occasional platform specific modifications (i.e. lack of BCD on NES).<br /><br />Sorry if any of these questions have been asked before on this forum or another one.<br /><br />1. What happens when the NES is powered on in terms of what the 6502 does? Is anything initialized? And does the CPU use the reset interrupt to initialise the PC?<br /><br />What I would really appreciate is if someone has already/could give me a cycle breakdown of the 6502s start sequence.<br /><br />2. MOS/Synertek/etc. all made 6502s but were there any differences between the 6502s that they made? (and I refer here to 6502 and not like the 6510's 2 zero page I/O)<br /><br />3. Are illegal opcodes the same across all 6502s or are there some instances where the opcode differed?<br /><br />4. Some people claim that the extra byte that BRK uses can be used for some purpose but like what?<br /><br />Thank you.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When the 6502 is powered on, it's just like it is being reset.  It jumps to the reset vector as if it's some kind of interrupt, so the CPU cycles are mostly the same as an interrupt.  The stack pointer is decremented 3 times (as if it's saving the return address and flags), but nothing is written to the stack.  Supposedly, all registers start at 00, so this makes the stack pointer start at FD.<br />We don't know what the initial state of the DMC channel is though.  The DMC power-on-state and PPU power-on-state vary enough to make the demo of Blades of Steel play differently every time you run it.<br /><br />Nocash warns not to use illegal instructions because some of them don't work on certain Commodore computer models.<br />But the instructions that combine the read-modify-write instructions with the ALU instructions are okay to use, since they give you additional addressing modes that otherwise are unavailable.  &quot;cmp \ dec&quot; is probably the most useful of the combined instructions, since it just basically adds '(ind),y' and 'abs,y' addressing modes to DEC.<br /><br />The extra BRK byte can be used by code that reads memory from the calling address, for situations where you are trying to reduce code size and don't care about speed.  For example, make your IRQ handler use that byte as an index to a jump table.  But don't try to use this feature if you are actually using interrupts, since the interrupt hides the BRK instruction.  This makes BRK kind of like RST on the Z80.
