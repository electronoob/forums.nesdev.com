Could be longer than that if any problems that need fixing appear.  Future hardware versions will not have any advancements like more RAM or bigger FPGA.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Pleeease release the constraints file</div>
<br />Sorry will have to wait a bit!  I will be putting out a package with one complete mapper like cnrom to show how all the config works.  Everything is built on Xilinx WebPack ISE 9.1i, which I believe is the most recent free downloadable version.  The files should also be convertable to 8.1 and possibly earlier versions.  Everything I have done is straight schematics, no HDL

<br />NSF is scheduled for the next mapper upgrade, which is just an update of the files on the CF card.  Bankswitching will be no problem, but expansion audio chips will not be supported.  There is no (simple) way to get the audio from those chips mixed into the NES audio.  Will have to wait for PowerPak FDS for that!

<br />3. High price point.
<br />4. Bugs.  I for one am waiting for the product to become more reliable.  I don't have to have this thing "right now" - I can wait, and I'll wait a year (or longer) if need be.

<br />
<br />These are very good points.  In an ideal word, this would stay off of Digg for a little while - and then hit it with an independent review detailing how incredibly cool this thing is.  If this hit dig right around the time Bunnyboy had his second batch ready to go (with any bugfixes), I imagine the digg crowd would clean him out.
<br />A quick note on the "high price point" comment.  I agree it's a little pricey for a lot of hobbyists - but it is really a steal for what it is.  I can't imagine bunnyboy's margin on these things is very much at all - and I know the development costs had to be in the $1K to $3K range, even if you count labor as free.  Milling machines don't grow on trees, and he had to do multiple passes of the PCB's, including going through a board stuffer since the parts are so small.  I spent well over $500 developing prototypes of my own multi-cart board, and it never came anywhere near completion, much less production.  Don't tell bunny, but I would gladly pay twice the price for for this item.

But it's still a lot of money to spend on a cartridge for such an old system, and that will keep some people away from the product.
