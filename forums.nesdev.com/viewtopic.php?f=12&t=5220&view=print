<br />
<br />I  have a a USB willem from mcumall.com, true USB in the since that is doesn't use the parallel port that I don't have.

<br />My version is True USB GQ-3X, but I plan to get the new one as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you get a Tototek SuperFlash cartridge the finished product will look much much nicer and it would be less work for you. And from the outside no one could tell what it is, and more importantly from the inside it will look very professional, where as if you build a cartridge with EPROMs no matter what it's going to look like a hacky mess. 
<br />
<br />Part of the issue is all the games you mentioned you want are large games which means you will require many chips making quite a mess. If you were wanting a small game where only one chip would be needed it wouldn't be so bad. But the first two games would require four 8M chips, or two 16M chips, not to mention wiring them together may require some extra effort, plus you need to find a suitable donor board. For ToP you'll need enough chips to add up to 48M plus I'm not even sure if the wiring changes or what kind of donor you need.
<br />
<br />So you should save yourself some trouble and just buy a flash cartridge. There doesn't have to be any menu or multicart stuff on it, you can flash it to be a single game.

<br />
<br />Each NHL96 new I bought cost me 5 bucks a piece delivered (I bought 20 lool, got through 4 of them so far). And Eproms kill, each 27c801 is from 5 to 8 dollars shipped depending on your eBay luck.
<br />
<br />And on top of that, if you don't have a solder or a soldering iron, check out dealextreme.com. Invest in desoldering braid, its a bit easier than a pump for first timers. Don't forget a bottle of flux (helps heat spread better by removing oxides from metal). And hit up radio shack and buy some 18 gauge wire, you can also use IDE cables, but some of them have like this crap metal that solder doesn't stick to easily and if you use one of those, you are just going to yell and scream in anger of how frustrating it is lol.
