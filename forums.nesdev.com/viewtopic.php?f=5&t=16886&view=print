		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />We're working on an NES action adventure that has a good bunch of text. And I would need a proofreader since I'm not an English native speaker.<br /><br />I need someone who is really proficient in the English language and who can spot errors or stuff that sounds strange. We don't want our game to sound like one of those poor translations.<br /><br /><br />Remember the cutscenes in &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;? That's the kind of language quality we're looking for: Clean, correct, well-sounding English.<br /><br />So, you should not only be a native speaker, but you should also know the written and spoken language very well.<br />I.e. if you ever used the words &quot;should of&quot; in a sentence, you're obviously not qualified. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><br /><br /><br />The game will still take a few months until completion, but of course we have to do things simultaneously, so I'm already looking for a proofreader now.<br /><br />Most of the main dialog is finished and I will probably send you the first version in the middle of January.<br />Apart from the main story dialog, we will also create dialogs for random non-playable characters, sidequests and all that stuff which will happen one by one and will be send to you in pieces.<br /><br />Before I send you the texts themselves, I'll send you a general outline of the story. (But that one doesn't need to be proofread, it's just for information purposes.)<br /><br /><br />You job is only to proofread our stuff and to change the words and sentences if they sound weird to a native speaker.<br />But don't worry, you don't need to create texts from scratch, so we're not looking for an author who writes the plot for us. (I.e. if the game was in German, I wouldn't need anybody for that job at all.) It's really just about the language.<br /><br /><br />In the moment, the text is about 3800 words long and consists entirely of spoken dialog.<br />I assume you could probably double this amount for all the additional texts that will still get into the game.<br />So, as you see, it's not <em>that</em> much. After all, we also have to keep the ROM space of an NES game in mind.<br /><br /><br />If you take the job and proofread all the texts that we send you, you will get the following things as a reward:<br /><br />A cartridge complete with box and manual of our first game &quot;City Trouble&quot;. (You'll get this one as soon as all the in-game texts are finished so far. Check the link in my signature to see that the game is still for sale, hence I can easily get one to you.)<br /><br />A cartridge complete with box and manual of the very game you proofread, the adventure. (You'll get this one as soon as it's for sale.)<br /><br /><br />Alright, if you want to do this, write me.<br />But please be aware: We do expect a text that is really error-free. I.e. if I show the corrected text to another native speaker, I don't want him to find 20 more language issues.<br /><br /><br /><em>Edit: Manual and box will require proofreading as well, but this comes much later.</em>
