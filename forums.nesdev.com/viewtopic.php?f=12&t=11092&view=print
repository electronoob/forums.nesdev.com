Well, I can't wait any more and I want to play my Super Metroid.  I have ressurected my boards if anyone has asking.  I had to do a few design changes but I got it pretty much tweaked, installed, tested and fully functional circuit.<br /><br />I apologize to previous people that have emailed me and contacted me about my boards and I didn't send them out.  I had some family things come up personally in my life so therefore may I re-introduce my circuit.  I also want to know if anyone else has tried it and what their results were.

Fortunately the SNES was pre-designed for future designs which allows for just a very simple 6db video amplifier.  <br /><br />On my circuit I did have another option to add a 6db buffer for the Luma (green) but, it is not necessary.

We are talking the good old Analog world and the circuit I designed is a simple standard video amplifier to bring it back up to spec so therefore you don't need a special TV or Receiver or need to worry about the resistance in the cables blah blah blah.   A company already designed the interface chip, boom, tossed it in works great.  I have heard of other people using transistors...meh...this chip was designed specifically for what we are trying to achieve.  To answer your question, NO you don't need a special TV.  I hooked this up to my projector and it works fine.  You DEFINITELY can tell the difference the picture is noticeably sharper and more vibrant.

(RGB is certainly not crap) In an easy nutshell. YCbCr is a consumer video format and this is the way HD is encoded. RGB is the traditional computer format. One is not superior to the other because each has it's own strengths and weaknesses. YCbCr is preferred because it is the native format.

I am saturating the reds a little too much because you can see a little distortion of color on the top.  Simple fix... I didn't have the exact components in surface mount than I did with through hole...I would have to order some.  The edges are much much smother around images.   The pixels are sure noticeable on a 144 inch screen.<br /><br />Bah, I will do this again for you and get a better tripod and the proper capacitors...but this is the teaser.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&gt; Actual RGB works through a SCART cable.<br /><br />Obviously. I have a Sony PVM that I output raw RGB to through a SCART adapter.<br /><br />I was inquiring about using the SNES with a component input TV.<br /><br />&gt; 240p is not standards compliant, and the vast majority of HDTVs (to the best of our knowledge) don't detect it and incorrectly try to deinterlace it.<br /><br />This, and color. I've read that most HDTVs don't accept R/G/B lines through component. They only accept Y/Pb/Pr. They are not equivalent at all. The SNES doesn't output in Y/Pb/Pr format on the MultiAV pins, which seems like a problem for directly connecting it to an HDTV.<br /><br />&gt; The BA6592F/S-ENC/S-RGB IC first converts RGB to YPrPb and then uses that to form s-video and composite.<br /><br />Ah, okay. So this chip lets you capture the raw Y/Pb/Pr before it's merged into S-video and composite? Neat.<br /><br />So with that out of the way, the only issue is finding an HDTV that definitely handles 240p properly. Kind of a shame there's not more in the way of cheap, no-latency line doublers. (you can do it, but that stuff gets so expensive ... culminating in the $500 XRGB Mini.)

If anyone wants to go deep into it Google has many solutions to creating a RGB to YPbPr converter.  For example LT has a LT1395 that will do it for you.  With your help of course, I could re-design and create the circuit, run it through my buffer and post my results...only if people enough people are interested.
