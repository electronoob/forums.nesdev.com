<br />
<br />I still think this problem is vastly overstated - it's only an issue if a mapper is intentionally exotic (like Squeedo with it's PIC - OTOH Action 52 used a PIC, and it's emulated fine <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />).  Every known board/mapper has been emulated (AFAIK), so I can't imagine any reason that wouldn't continue to be the case in the future.  And that's with extensive reverse-engineering, it sure would get easier when the design specs are 100% documented.
<br />
<br />But yeah, it's probably gonna take an FPGA or something to recreate an MMC5.  It just isn't worth what it would cost, yet (it's possible there will be a cheaper 5V compatible solution later, but maybe not real likely).  If it were somehow possible to do an ASIC mapper (which would be great), hopefully it would be something better than the MMC5.

<br />
<br />Many thanks! The main thing I'd like to add is 4-screen mirroring, which is one of the few gaps in the MMC5's repertoire. I anticipate that this will require partial redesign of the ASIC itself, with respect to how the $5104 and $5105 registers are handled. Obviously, I'll have to provide an additional 2kB of RAM for the two extra name tables, either by bumping up the existing 1kB or doing some kind of supplemental work-around like the unlicensed version of <em>Gauntlet</em>. I'd also like to explore the possibility of expanding the $5130 register to allow for unique high-bits for B/G tiles across the four name tables:
<br />
<br />d7-d6 = High bits for NT3
<br />d5-d4 = High bits for NT2
<br />d3-d2 = High bits for NT1
<br />d1-d0 = High bits for NT0 (default)
<br />
<br />If I still have time/room/sanity after all of that, I'll look into adding the extra sound channels from the VRC6 (or perhaps just the sawtooth).

<br />
<br />Yea, it gets expensive <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />And as for having a custom IC made most of the cost is in the up front tooling charges, I think.

<br />
<br />When the MMC5 was made, Nintendo was doing quite well. They sold hundreds of thousands of cartridges. For them, having the custom ASICs made of MMC5 was not a big deal and not that expensive per unit since they were made in high volume. No one now can expect to ever use that many mapper chips in those sorts of volumes. So making an ASIC clone of MMC5 would cost so much per unit that your game would be quite expensive I think. 
<br />
<br />While it would be nice, there is certainly a point to be made if someone wants MMC5 for their game, which is look at games that use discrete logic like Castlevania, Battletoads, Mega Man, Contra, as well as games that use no mapper like Super Mario Bros. You don't need all that for your game to be fun.

<br />
<br />True. But if a game concept is best realized via something like MMC5, I'd be foolish to dismiss it without a proper vetting. And when another game concept's summary is literally "<em>A celebration of what could've been</em>", I'm arguably obligated to pursue such leads.

<br />Then it's also probably well realized on a platform that does what Nintendon't: Genesis, Super NES, Windows/Linux, or Android. And if you have two successful commercial projects behind you, you can even take it to a modern console, like how Grand Theftendo became Retro City Rampage.

<br />Sure, I could take my retro graphics, shove them into a big 32-bit PNG, code the whole thing in C# and not have to worry about palette count and how much time I have to do collision detection, but it just wouldn't be as cool (or challenging), and it would not have that authentic soul.

<br />It's still something you can put in your portfolio if you're looking to land an actual job at a game company (like I am). Coding in 6502 assembly gives you a pretty big advantage that less and less people have these days (since the NES/C64 is so old and "pointless"): experience with low-level programming and hand-optimizing your routines. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />Bingo! When people ask me what "program" I'm using to make my first game, I'm never quite sure what to say? I know "Translhextion" isn't the answer they're looking for...

<br />No, we just do all the Making Stuff Happen™!
<br />
<br />In the interest of full disclosure, I'm only doing this because the idea itself has enough of a stranglehold over me that I can't *not* do it. (If that makes any sense.) There's a story about a purple angelfish that needs to be told, and I'm the only one able to tell it... There's also a unique game mechanic I'm interested in executing, not to mention the allure of an 8-bit New Jack Swing soundtrack.

<br />Thanx! Although I suspect it has more to do with me being a control freak than anything else...
<br />
<br />On the plus side, I figure this is a good way to force myself to learn all this stuff (scrolling handlers, music engines, etc.) honestly. Once I've built an entire MMC5 game from the ground-up, I'll have more solid ground upon which to pursue the MMC7 Project.
