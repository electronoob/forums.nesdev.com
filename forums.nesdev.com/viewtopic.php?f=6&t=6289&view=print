<br />
<br />My old IBM PS/1 had a headphone jack for the PC speaker.  Had a volume control, was pretty nice actually with a select few programs.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I remember wearing headphones experimenting with the square waves, not really sure of what I was doing or how certain things would effect the sound... Yeah, not a good idea! I ended up with some obnoxious tones in my ear that actually made me feel weird to listen to. After a while, I concluded there were health risks involved if I didn't take off my headphones <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.
<br />
<br />But besides that, I have listened to NSFs with headphones, and I agree they sound pretty bad. One reason NES music might sound horrible on headphones is the complete lack of bass. It seems like all songs just have no power or meaning behind them, like there's a bunch of sound missing from what's heard. And I don't know, I just feel so awkwardly embraced by mathematics when I hear NES music on headphones; it just sounds so calculated and unnatural. If that makes any sense...

<br />
<br />I also used to use a lot headphones with the GBA, of which a lot of games makes heavy use of old GB PSG channels. But now I tend to hardly use headphones anymore because of health risks.

I definitely notice a weird warbling effect if I listen to such music for a while, then stop and hear normal sounds.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't have any issues with listening to nes music with earphones. No problem with bass too. For nsf players, I always use a filter to make it sound more like a real nes. Without that, the sound is too crisp and feel less accurate to me.
<br />
<br />The only nsf I had issue with is Crystalis because of the sample used always pop or something and was annoying for the ear. 
<br />
<br />I listen to nes music almost everyday and earphone was the only way. Maybe I'm just used to it. I'm using canal earphones with seems to have an emphasis on bass so maybe this is why it's sound ok.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i think the 2a03 is capable of good bass, especially from the Triangle waveform. though even with a straight Triangle wave on its own, there's still some odd high-frequency content in there somewhere that can really grate on your ears after a while. the other channels aren't any better in their regard to outputting high frequencies, and the DPCM channel can get pretty nasty due to sample aliasing. the problem is that there's no filtering capabilities in the 2a03, which always leaves the highs blasting. 
<br />
<br />there's not much of any way around it on the hardware, but it can be fine-tuned to some degree using external EQ. as for headphones, (i'm not sure what you have now, but) you try another set with a flatter frequency response or even bass-enhancement.  
<br />
<br />the Game Boy is similar, sometimes it just starts to hurt your ears after a while.

<br />Once, while trying to figure out why I couldn't hear bass in the music engine I was writing for <a href="http://www.pineight.com/tod/" class="postlink">TOD</a>, I analyzed the frequency response of my GBA's speaker by playing a song that just turned on the noise channel. The internal speaker's response was close to a 3rd-order Butterworth band-pass filter with corners at about 800 Hz and 10000 Hz; headphones fared better.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The problem with using the triangle wave as bass is that it's almost inaudible when you start playing low pitches. But I will agree, this is what you'd want to use for bass (I always have square melodies and triangular bass lines). I guess using the DCM for bass is also an option. I've heard some pretty good bass come out of that on Nerd Tracker...

<br />
<br />well, i was talking more about a dedicated lo/band/hi-pass filter like found on the SID chip.
