		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This's something I slapped together for fun.  A friend of mine kept raving about how the snes spdif digital audio mod sounds way better than the analog from the console.  Since I don't have any spdif or digital hardware I didn't bother with the mod for a long time.  Then I heard an actual recording of the digital audio compared to the default analog and it is indeed superior sounding.<br /><br />So I went out and got the parts and did the digital audio mod.  I bought a cheap ebay spdif to analog converter to test that it works.  Everything works fine, at first I had this hissing noise but today I sat down and fixed that.  The spdif getting converted to analog using the ebay converter does indeed sound different:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=smpUQsj6Ioc" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=smpUQsj6Ioc</a><br /><br />I prefer the new audio circuit but it's really up to personal preference.  The snes by default has a lot of muffle so this's a mod that can help a little bit with that.<br /><br />Also tiido was nice enough to point out that the digital audio signals in the snes are i2s standard.  I tried using a straight i2s to analog chip to skip going to spdif and back.  It works I can hear the audio but the output is majorly distorted.  Oh well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />After I make the two recordings match stereo (one's reversed) and match phase (one's inverted) and normalize the volumes to match, I'm having the worst time actually distinguishing the two versions... I can't hear it. I can't even see it in a spectrogram.<br /><br />If I do take the original recordings, match phase to the sample, and have the two recordings cancel each other out, there's a residual that seems to be mostly from ~3kHz to ~10kHz... It's awfully subtle though.

Also I believe YouTube also applies some sort of compression (referring to dynamic range compression, the audio &quot;effect&quot;, not data compression) to the signal.

The pre-emphasis I speak of is an equalizer effect applied just before the BRR sample data is created. So one would need to replace the game's or SPC file's BRR samples with remastered samples.

Then again if you think it sound better I'm glad it worked for you.</div><br /><br />IMO, the main point in doing these mods is to get as clean a signal from the machine as possible without electrical noise from the other bits getting in the way.  For machines like the SNES, Saturn, Dreamcast and others that work with standard digital interfaces inside it's trivial to break out a clean signal before the video gets a chance to sit on it.  For machines that don't like the NES we can take the audio from as close to the source as possible and re-implement the mixing circuitry with proper shielding and isolation.  For machines like the C64, we can go one step (well ok, two steps) further and provide the hardware with its own regulated power supplies and provide isolation on the address and data lines.<br /><br />The bus noise inside the C64 is so bad sometimes that at least one demo has proven that the C64 can play music without the SID inserted: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW2XKSWUPLw" class="postlink">Vicious Sid 'No SID' Part</a>

Oh well.</div><br /><br />I did the SNES S/PDIF mod just the other day and was thinking about what you did. Instead of using a crummy eBay DAC, why not just save that step and do it yourself internally? You got distortion, but I say don't give up, keep at it and try to find a DAC that'll work. I'm willing to bet most people don't have a digital audio option, and thus don't care about S/PDIF, but if you could &quot;upgrade&quot; the DAC internally and get a noticeable improvement then I bet a lot of people would be interested in that. Perhaps try a different D/A, or keep the S/PDIF mod with the CS8406 and then find an IC that'll convert one of its standards to analog. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">SkinnyV wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">While I can understand some video mod to get better video quality without creating other issue (like those NES RGB mod erroneous palette), I have trouble understanding all those other crazy stereo/digital/whatever audio mod for retro console trying to fix non-issue IMO.

Then again if you think it sound better I'm glad it worked for you.</div><br /><br />I'm not replying to just you, SkinnyV, I'm just continuing on what you said.<br /><br />What I can't understand is why so many people hunt for the best video quality and ignore audio quality completely. I'm speaking in general, not just in the video game realm. But how many people know some one that went out a bought this huge 1080p cutting edge million refresh rate TV, but only listen to it through the TV's speakers? Most TV speakers are just complete garbage. That kind of thing boggles me. It only makes sense to balance your better video quality with better audio quality. <br /><br />Not that I'm defending the NES &quot;stereo&quot; mod. I really don't see the point of that. It's stereo in the sense that different sounds come out of the left speaker than the right, but that's not really what stereo is about. NES games aren't programmed for stereo, so you don't get actions on the left side of the screen coming out the left speaker and vise versa, panning from left to right and right to left, stereoscopic music, et cetera. What you get is something that was intended to be mono broken up into stereo, which would have a negative outcome IMO. <br /><br />But as for the SNES S/PDIF mod, I'm very happy with it. I recently got a new AV receiver with digital audio inputs, so I was eager to get digital audio from my SNES. I set it up so I could switch between analog and digital to compare. I'll admit, at first the only thing I noticed was digital was a little louder. But after listening to a few different things, the difference is definitely there. And I don't have the greatest setup in the world. Not that there was a &quot;problem&quot; with the SNES audio, but digital is just better. Everything is a little more clear. Highs and lows, especially lows, now appear to be muffled on analog. While listening to music from games, there's more separation between parts (I guess you could just say it's more clear), and overall there's better stereo separation. <br /><br />A YouTube video might not be the best way to evaluate the difference. Especially since this one converted the digital to analog before recording. Is the improvement HUGE? I think the average person wouldn't notice much difference. That's not to say I think I'm better than anyone, or I'm some huge audio nut. I've just noticed that people more easily notice improvements in video but not so much in audio. But it's definitely a decent improvement nonetheless. And at least with digital you don't have to worry about interference. <br /><br />Anyway, that's just my thoughts on the matter.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

Others have said YouTube isn't the best for audio comparisons because of compression. So those two things combined, it isn't the best thing for you to evaluate how the S/PDIF from the SNES can sound. <br /><br />I really wouldn't mind making some recordings, but I do not have S/PDIF on my PC. Hmm, well I might have S/PDIF out, but not in.<br /><br /><br />Another thing I just remembered, regarding the benefits of digital audio, is the lack of a hum. Some people get a nasty hiss with analog audio, which is completely absent with digital.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I did some playing with the system today.  Some games I can hear the difference (it isn't huge), other games sound the same.  What I really wish would be a way to remove the interpolation.<br /><br />As for audio upgrades there's a lot of possibilities out there.  Thanks to the help of ace on sega16 I learned how to tweak the low pass filter on the audio circuit of the model 1 sega genesis.  I can now set the model 1 genesis audio circuit so high I hear distortion that's normally filtered out, and I can set it so low it sounds like the music is being played through a wall.  I'm just waiting on caps to set it how I like, some games sound too muffled so it's a good thing to do.  With the famicom the upgrade kits I use from japan work, however they only sound right on the av famicom which is a bit of a shame.  Regarding the whole nes stereo separation thing it's really easy to mix the two channels together if you don't like the effect, I just set my amp to mono output on both speakers.  I've been trying to improve my gaming audio experience since I was 13 and my dad gave me his old 1979 pioneer amp (which is still what I use today).

I'm not asking in a sarcastic way, I'm just wondering if there's something I missed. Is there some kind of quality improvement if the sound channels remain separate until they hit the amp? I would think, no, there isn't. And if there is, it would just be a very, very small improvement in clarity. Or am I wrong?
