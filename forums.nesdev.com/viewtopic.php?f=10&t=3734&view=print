		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />this book seems to be a good <a href="http://www.westerndesigncenter.com/wdc/datasheets/Programmanual.pdf" class="postlink">book</a> for what i want to do, since i've always been fascinated with the SNES as well. i'm reading about the 6502 in this book at the moment, since it talks about the architechure of all the processors and their evolution.
<br />
<br />my question is, do you think that this would be a good way to learn about the chips, program for them, then come back when i'm a bit familiar with them and start using their modafied versions to program for NES and SNES?

<br />
<br />If you don't have any background in computers, I can understand why things aren't clicking together, but I know from experience that it's very possible to teach yourself with a lot of perseverance.
<br />
<br />That said, there are some building blocks that I think are EXTREMELY important to learn (actually to *know*!) in order to succeed:
<br />
<br />-Number systems (decimal vs hexadecimal vs binary)
<br />-Boolean gates (and, or, not, xor)
<br />-Address space and word size
<br />-Pointers (addresses in memory as opposed to data in memory)
<br />-Stacks
<br />-Roughly how an ALU works (especially the flags)
<br />-Signed numbers ("two's complement")
<br />
<br />They may seem like really abstract concepts right now but once you get very familiar with them, 6502 should start making more sense.

<br />A book is cheaper than a laptop computer on which to download and read the free websites that are out there. I didn't really master 6502 until I borrowed a book from the library, which I could read while away from a computer.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is true but I think most libraries won't carry 6502 books. Mine happened to, but I didn't find any of them extremely helpful since they all focused almost entirely on Apple II or C64 algorithms and not generic 6502.
<br />
<br />If you don't have internet-access or a printer at home, I would suggest using the library's computers to surf and print 6502 websites if at all possible before purchasing a book.

<br />i got the 1980 edition, should i cancel the order and go for the 82 edition?
<br />main reason i was so quick to get this one, was cause the seller is in my state so it shouldl ship quickly, but it's 2 dollars cheaper for OR. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> and 1982 edition
