What are you talking about a perfect SNES map editor? It's very easy to program a tiled map editor. I could do that in very little time. <br /><br />I see in no way how SNES's VRAM and OAM is harder. It is infact easier thanks to DMA, and I don't find it hard to understand how stuff works.<br /><br />Making a map editor for a SNES game in windows has been done by tons of people that have been hacking games like Super Mario World and Super Metroid. <br /><br />You're not going to "find" and editor for making your game, well unless you find a universal type like 'Mappy'. You'll have to program it yourself. This is not hard if you understand even alittle programming. If you can't make an editor, you need to start with the basics of programming and game development.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Wed May 07, 2008 5:23 pm</p><hr />
