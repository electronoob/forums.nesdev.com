		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm using windows 10 (my bad)  and a few years ago while going back and forth with 7 it was not so bad when running on a old pc (E8400 core 2 duo), except for the telemetry, the auto-rebooting and a few other things that made me cringe which I'm forgetting ^^;;  But now in the recent months, I don't know if it's because of the latest patch (spectre, meltdown, swiss cheese whatever) it seems to be getting slower and slower by the day.  I forgot why I went to 10, must have been an issue I had with 7 or something.<br /><br />I could go back to windows 7 (which I still prefer) but that would be quite time consuming because of all the windows update issues from a fresh sp3 and in less than 2 years the update will be over anyway.<br /><br />What I would like to know if people are seeing slow down these days, either with windows 7/10 or maybe some of my computer parts may be dying on me.  I starting to prefer linux than windows (use it at work everyday) but the kids have games and we like to play together on that old rig. The other reason to maybe go back to 7 is the driver for the gamepads for ps3 (scptoolkit) is not working any more and it seems to be caused by the latest update (driver signing issue or something, didn't find the cause yet).<br /><br />Am I the only one to see those slowdown or it now a common thing?

I moved away from Windows 7 because I was running into a lot of problems involving VC++ runtimes and .NET Frameworks, which were refusing to install because of missing updates I also couldn't install and were preventing me from running software I needed.<br /><br />I used to have a LOT of slowdown on my desktop PC (which I built in 2017) after installing Windows 10, but it turned out to be my Hard Drives that were dying (ended up losing 2 of them!) due to a bad PSU. Once I replaced the bad Hard Disks and switched to a much better PSU, everything was fine.

Is there a good way to test the health of hdd? I know that an sdd would help a lot, especially with such an old computer but it's not something I can update yet (budget doesn't allow it).

I will check them to refresh my memory. Thanks!<br /><br />@tokumaru<br /><br />I guess my message was misleading ^^;; I just meant I changed OS.  I never upgrade an OS, always do a clean install when changing OS because of all the leftovers that could causes issues. I would consider windows 10 a &quot;downgrade&quot; but I guess this is my personal opinion only <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />With windows 10, every quarter they have a new upgrade that reinstall everything and breaks X app along the way so I'm getting tired of that cycle.  Another thing is the superfetch,telemetry service, nvidia telemetry (and I guess other ones that I don't remember) that seems to like to grin my hdd to their hearts content every time I reboot it.  If it wasn't for games, old apps and just habit to always have windows installed, I don't see why I need to use it.

The only reason to even buy a new computer (laptop, anyway) at this point in time is because they're built so shotty that they'll fall apart.<br /><br />I haven't noticed any performance loss since it came out, but it's far from the most efficient OS ever, from the Photos App always catching photos in the background, to Cortana always listening for your voice, to Windows Defender scanning your computer for the nteenth time to tell you &quot;no threat was detected&quot; to all the uneccesary graphics filtration, to &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot; installing in the background... What's insulting is that Microsoft made it to where you can't (easily) get rid of most of this stuff, and in the case of all the advertisements, they get turned back on everytime you update anyway!<br /><br />Computers are powerful enough now to handle all these services, I guess, but even a Mack truck hauling just 1,000 pounds extra will be slower than one not.

Hopefully I can get one someday. <br /><br />@Fisher<br /><br />I will give it a try, thanks!  Today it seems normal so my guess is it may not be the HDD but Windows background threads mentioned above (telemetry, superfetch) that seems to start at the most inappropriate moment <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />@Dwedit<br /><br />I'm still using the HDD that I bought with the machine and I'm surprised they are still working. Even the IDE one from 2005 (that I'm not using rarely) is still spinning, somehow ^^;;  I will keep what you mentioned once I install an SDD if I see any similar slowdowns.<br /><br />@Drew Sebastino<br /><br />My retired 4 years old work computer is light and day for I/O so I hope to upgrade one of my old HDD so I can compile a lot faster.

A conventional hard disk drive (HDD) beats a solid state drive (SSD) in capacity per dollar, but SSD wins in input and output operations per second (IOPS), as its seek time for reads is near zero.
