<br />
<br />true. but I'. guessing that it still would work without the PowerPak setting up the PowerPak as I've also tested it on both Nintendulator and Nestopia.. thought you never know <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />I haven't started yet, but I'm qualified and interested.  The Xilinx webpack is pretty easy to use, and bunny has provided everything that is needed.  I was really hoping someone would organize a list of "these mappers have bugs, here's who's working on replacements".  Also, any that I do I will release the schematics for, and bunny is more than welcome to use them in any way he wants.

<br />
<br />I think I have found the root problem for the sprite glitches.  It is possible there is a software fix but it may have to be a hardware one.  In that case I will be doing a recall and instructions for those that do not want to wait for shipping.  I am still doing some testing but hope to have everything figured out this week.  I have seen some background white lines but not often enough to tell if this fix makes those right too.  If half of heads are missing in SMB3, this is the problem!
<br />
<br />Even if you are not seeing problems it is probably a good idea to do the fix.  Slight manufacturing variations in the NES systems means the board may work perfect on one system, but have major sprite problems on another system of the same kind.  My test system is one that happens to work well so I did not know the problem was so big.
<br />
<br />For those technical people, the problem appears to be a bus conflict during sprite DMA.  The PowerPak responds too quickly which corrupts the data headed from the internal RAM to the PPU.  By adding the resistors the cart will always lose the bus conflict and display correctly.  The PRG and CHR rom/ram data are unaffected, which is why none of the supported games would crash.

<br />I guess the PowerPak is just too good for the NES.

<br />
<br />Memblers:  Bananmos suggested it might be one problem and noted your experiences with the EPROM emulator too.  Kevtris said some Sachen carts can crash his CopyNES bios if they don't have the resistors.  Game Genie also uses them internally.

<br />Before i start cutting traces, i'm interested in hearing how folks make out with this mod. I'll take another look at my 'problem' images, but i feel like some of the issues would be beyond OAM DMA-related.
