If true, this invalidates some of the other tests.<br /><br />I'll probably be done with that at some point tonight, so you might as well ignore the old code for now.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Awesome - finally some conclusive results! Thanks for taking the time to do all these tests!<br /><br />Test 3 failing in this case is fine, since it was just me assuming the FDS' behavior.<br />Apparently writing $02 to $4022 will trigger an IRQ immediately if the reload value is $00 - so I guess the IRQ triggers whenever the timer is at 0, rather than when it reaches 0.  One thing left to test might be checking if turning on the irq repeat flag when the reload is 0 makes the irq fire in an infinite loop (I'm assuming it would)<br /><br />@Zepper I could be wrong, but I'm under the impression the FDSStick(?) is probably emulation the disk drive and its IRQs? (i.e the disk irqs probably can't be properly validated without actually writing the test rom to a FDS disk and loading that?)<br />I only have a vague understanding of how the disk loading &amp; its irqs work, to be honest, so I probably couldn't write a test for it even if I wanted to.

You MIGHT want to load only your test rom onto fdsstick, removing any other games. This will bypass the boot menu and load your rom directly.<br /><br />I'll leave <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=194859#p194859" class="postlink">this here</a>, it seems relevant.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hm! Very curious. I tried modifying my IRQ logging program, in particular to skip calling the BIOS reset to start the program (which normally writes to $4023). I found if I wrote $00 or $83 to $4023 once, nothing unusual happened, but if I skipped writing to it altogether, I got a variety of things happening (sirq2_no_reset.fds):<br /><br />1. Loads and runs normally.<br />2. Loads and runs, but disk activity never seems to stop. No IRQ, but the FDSstick keeps turning on the green light over and over. (Or in the plugged into USB mode, the progress bar keeps repeating from 0 to 100%.)<br />3. Hangs on black screen, disk activity never stops.<br /><br />One time I even caught one IRQ in the log but I accidentally reset and I haven't been able to reproduce it. Not sure if I caused it accidentally by pressing buttons or moving my Famicom around too much etc.<br /><br /><br />So, at least one write to $4023 after the license bypass NMI seems to be needed to reliably stop the disk access, but sometimes it stopped normally anyway? I didn't managed to get any good leads on whether this can make an IRQ...<br /><br />Anyhow, sorry this post isn't very good information but it feels like the function of $4023 is more complicated than just disable/enable? Does the BIOS really only write it twice on reset? And even then it makes a point of writing $00 before $83... is that more like a reset sequence?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That could actually explain the difference with the old version of the test - each test writes $83 to $4023 before starting to reset any changes I make to the disk enabled register in some of the tests.  Maybe that's why this one doesn't freeze up - the I flag doesn't get cleared until after that $83 write, so any disk irqs would essentially be ignored.<br /><br />I made one final version to fix the expected result for the failed test, and add 2 more tests related to the behavior when the reload value is 0.  I'm expecting these to pass on the FDS - if they do, this will probably be the last version of this for now.  Disk IRQs can be in their own separate test, if I ever get around to looking at those.<br /><br />I'll try to update the FDS page on the wiki with the information that was confirmed by these tests once I get a chance.
