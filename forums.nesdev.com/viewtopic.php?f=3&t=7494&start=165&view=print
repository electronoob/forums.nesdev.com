<br />I don't see what the big deal is about that anyway, other than the whole idea of "you may not use this decompression code to reverse engineer and reimplement the compression algorithms" meaning you're not "totally free" to do "whatever you want" with the code. Oh well, I guess other people can spend all the time they want worrying about how free they are to use whichever software to their liking, and I'll continue to use all the software I want to my liking, regardless of whatever clickthrough EULA I chose to ignore, or if the developer was enough of a jerk, immediately scrolled to the bottom of to enable the "Accept" button. Next thing you know, they'll make a license agreement page in installers which require you to page through the license at a "normal" reading pace to enable the "Accept" button.

<br />Nah, they'll make you retype the license, word for word, and they will disable copy + paste.  Evil bastards.

<br />I don't understand why people use rar anyway.  Does it have some feature set that makes it better than zip?

<br />It's not whether you paid anything for it, it's whether you're Free to do whatever you want with the source code, including reinventing the commercial-only Rar archive compression utility, which contains proprietary algorithms that the author doesn't want anyone to know about. (Because they're probably so dead simple that keeping them away from the public is the only incentive he has to get people to pay for his archiver. Not that anyone with a brain does that. There are alternatives. Such as renaming the nag dialog resource so it can't even spawn it. Or more legal alternatives, such as 7-zip.)

<br />
<br />Then tepples should have clarified what he meant.
<br />
<br />Free as in freedom is reserved for animate objects*, whereas free refers to cost for inanimate objects. Examples:
<br />
<br /><strong>Makes sense:</strong>
<br />The Libyans were finally freed from their captors.
<br />The beer was totally free, I didn't have to pay anything!
<br />
<br /><strong>Makes no sense:</strong>
<br />The Canadians are free, take as many as you like.
<br />After years of torture, the steak knife was finally set free.
<br />
<br />* our Supreme Court has not <em>yet</em> declared software to also be human beings with first amendment rights.

<br />
<br />I had Squeedo loading iNES files back in 2004, was the first thing I implemented, years before the PowerPak existed.  Just using hyperterminal, no special software needed - just a controller port RS232 adapter.  There is no possible way that could have worked if the files were zipped.  It would have to load the zip file into flash, uncompress to RAM, and write the unpacked ROM to flashrom again - not really even possible (except with ROMs much smaller than memory - assuming that unzipping on the NES is even possible).
<br />
<br />Seems like a waste of effort to make an NES program format that the NES itself can't load without taking heroic efforts.. I like other aspects of the proposal though, but it seems like iNES 2.0 addresses most of the stuff we'd need (none of these formats have everything I'd <em>want</em> - like a ROM version field and all that crap that ends up getting tacked on the filename).

<br />
<br />
<br />I meant in the first instance that ines could be easily used (read: loaded, manipulated, processed) by a stock NES, while zip files cannot since they need an elaborate uncompress program.   Barefoot ines files do not- you just load them into memory and go from there.
<br />
<br />If you support zip, you must support all the baggage that goes along with it, and essentially reproduce the entire pkunzip.exe in 6502 asm.   Sure you can SAY that only compression format XYZ can be used, but that's just a band-aid on the problem.   I envision people whining that their games only work in some places and not others due to differences in the way different things zip stuff.
<br />
<br />This also doesn't mention the speed (lack thereof) when a 6502 is decompressing anything, even if there is enough RAM for it to do its thing.  I really would be interested in seeing someone write a complete decompresser in 6502 asm that has a speed comparable to just directly loading the uncompressed version.

The license of UnRAR is "non-free" per the GNU and Debian distributions because it prohibits users from deducing the format of a RAR archive. See <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing/Unrar" class="postlink">why UnRAR cannot be included in Fedora</a>. The license term in question is as follows, with my emphasis:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The UnRAR sources may be used in any software to handle RAR archives without limitations free of charge, but <strong>cannot be used to re-create the RAR compression algorithm</strong>, which is proprietary.

<br />It's overloading, just as method names and operators can be overloaded in C++ and Python. "Free software" in the GNU sense means anybody who receives the code is free to use it, learn from it, improve it, and share it. And prior to the 1860s, the following was grammatical in U.S. English: "The negroes are free; take as many as you like."
