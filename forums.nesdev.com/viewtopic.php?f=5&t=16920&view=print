Katherine Kerr did a good job in the Daggerspell series. <br />-Just take names you kind of like and modify wovels (Game of thrones method).<br /><br />or a combo. <br /><br />Descriptive names can be effective too, to descibe something about their character or history or social caste. Some made up examples:<br />-Worrum (servant?)<br />-Hunch (court jester?)<br />-Three eyes (shaman?)<br />-Fingers (thief?)<br /><br /><br />Avoid (imo):<br />Fake elvish.<br /><br />(edit for spelling error)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Two more naming language tricks:<br /><br />If your fiction includes involves ongoing or historical contact between two cultures, try two different naming languages, one for each culture. A character's name may hint at ethnicity caste, etc.<br /><br />Another is to take names from one language, adapt them to another language's phonology, and run them through centuries of systematic sound changes. An example from Hebrew through Greek, Latin, French, and English is &quot;Yosef&quot;, &quot;Maryam&quot;, &quot;Yitzchak&quot;, and &quot;Hefziba&quot;, which get worn down to &quot;Joe&quot;, &quot;Mary&quot;, &quot;Isaac&quot;, and &quot;Hepsie&quot;.

Like when Konami thought it was a good idea to name Dracula in Castlevania Cronqvist. <br /><br />Dracula, according to this mythos, was born in the 9th century (or was tenth? don’t remember), central europe.<br />The spelling implies 17th or 18th century scandinavia<br />The name itself has a structure not existing at the point of time Dracula was human. These names (combining two short nouns; often in a nature romanticist style) were used by the rising gentry and later on the bourgeoisie to mimic the family names of nobles. Dracula was of a noble house, and a very powerful one at that.

At least for the characters. Location names might be another issue, but even there I will probably not just connect some random syllables.<br /><br />For example, our barmaid is called Alison and the warrioress is called Leyla. The king is King Henry.<br /><br />Descriptive names might be possible too, but this should make logical sense.<br />If the hero is named &quot;hero&quot; in another language and the adventurer is named &quot;adventurer&quot;, this can get pretty ridiculous since it's a pretty strange coincidence in-universe.<br />The evil overlord on the other hand can have a name that means &quot;ruler&quot; since he or his parents probably gave it to him due to his lineage.<br /><br />I like the way &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; did it where most of the names are not too outlandish:<br />Willy, Amanda, Lester, Julius, Marcie.<br /><br />But they also have some more fantasy-like names:<br />Bogart, Cibba, Davias, Watts.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Avoid (imo):<br />Fake elvish.</div><br />That won't be a problem. Since this is a fantasy world in a universe where our earth doesn't exist at all, I will not bother with pretending that they speak some foreign language.<br />They speak English. Not just for the player, but the in-universe language is English as well. For example, text signs, if they appear, will be written with regular letters, not with some made-up alphabet.<br /><br />And most of the non-enemy characters are humans, i.e. we don't have that wild mix of hobbits, dwarfes, elves and rock monsters. In this regard, we're closer to &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; than to &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, so elvishness is not an issue either.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If you want to post existing masculine names publicly or privately along with their putative meanings or in-universe origins in the fiction, I could help guide you toward how to build the feminine ones.

Just single names.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If your fiction includes involves ongoing or historical contact between two cultures, try two different naming languages, one for each culture. A character's name may hint at ethnicity caste, etc.</div><br />Yeah, we have that with the two female characters: Alison the barmaid has a pretty standard current-day name. The name for Leyla from the warrior tribe is a bit more outlandish.<br /><br />King Henry got a typical royal name.<br /><br />The adventurer should get a pretty standard name as well since he's also from that same kingdom and a normal guy.<br /><br />The hero is from another part of the world. He will be the most difficult part.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Here’s another don’t (again, imo): <br />Use existing names without taking time evaluating its realworld context at least somewhat.
