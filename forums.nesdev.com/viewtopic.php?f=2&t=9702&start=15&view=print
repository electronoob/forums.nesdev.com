Depending on the scenario, it might certainly be easier to just not allow them in, in the first place. This can be done by moving them one pixel at a time, like you were saying.<br /><br />And since my game is a platformer, with upwards of 8 enemies + projectiles on the screen at one time, it can be tricky to manage time, so moving one pixel at a time wouldn't work. But for a static screen game, it would definitely be easier.

Then again, I've never done collision detection for an object with a rotated bounding box. You might also use a square bounding box that just changes dimensions as the objects rotate, to more appropriately accommodate the object it houses.

That would've been impressive. I really don't see how this stuff in Super Castlevania 4 is way more advanced than what Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts has.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The rotating of the level in Super CV4 has very limited collision going on while the level actually rotates. There is the ground plane that you need to escape by whipping the hold. It gradually slopes and I believe eventually you'll slide off and die. Then it rotates once more where again you'll slide off the small platform and fall to your death if you don't whip the hold. There isn't a whole lot going on. I'm not sure how difficult it would be to program something to handle this. You may not need to involve the background map array at all, you could simulate these things were game objects that you don't actually see as sprites. The big swinging things in the later level are just some kind of game object platforms that behave in that swinging pattern probably. <br /><br />So I'd agree that neither game does anything completely amazing with scaling while actually navigating a level. It's just a visual effect but in practice probably only the minimal amount of effort to compute whatever needs to be done. I think you'd need a coprocessor to calculate everything if the whole level was rotating without some sort of tricks. But then again those tricks are part of the fun of figuring out how to do such effects.<br /><br />The two backgrounds at the 3:30 mark, the scrolling up part actually might be sprites. The SNES has enough sprites per line to do that. All the pieces moving up could be game objects that it tests collision with.
