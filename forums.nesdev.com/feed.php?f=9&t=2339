The capacitor you mention is the one I mention as C23.  The inductor you mention I refer to above as FC1.<br /><br />So, to return to my question 1: are the voltages on the legs of that cap proper?  Should they be 2.5 volts?  I would've thought 5 volts was the desired voltage but of course the leg that has 5v is the leg not giving sound (I'm told both legs of the capacitor should give sound when tapped).<br /><br />And question 2 - do you think the Honeybee converter + the resets it caused did this?<br /><br />Any help appreciated.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1288">Slipgate</a> — Mon Oct 23, 2006 6:10 pm</p><hr />

A third-party schematic I have sure does show a 7404 being used as an audio amplifier. CMOS gates can be used in the analog region around 2.5V, because the opposing transistors give symmetrical response (unlike TTL). In my limited knowledge, the setup looks like an inverting amplifier with negative feedback (the 47K resistor) to establish proper DC bias and to adjust slew rate. Before the 7404 is a 1 uF coupling capacitor, and after it is a 39 uH inductor.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Mon Oct 23, 2006 5:38 pm</p><hr />

Well, er, if you could point things out when I provide a photo, that would be very helpful.  I'm not actually sure what some of what you're referencing with the acronyms is.<br /><br />What I do know is based on another board where repairs are done where they pointed everything out to me (such as where the audio goes in and comes out) and it's all been legit or based on schematics so far.  I have noticed that the 7404 can reset the system (I've done it)...<br /><br />There's an inductor marked FC1 before the RF modulator that you can get already-amplified sound from (on working systems)... I've been told its the last place that the sound goes before entering the RF modulator (this from a page dealing with modding the sound).<br /><br />I'm familiar with pins 1 and 2 (R3 and R4 are connected to them) but what is the ferrite bead?  And where is the RLC output portion?<br /><br />Anyway, I'm able to intercept the audio earlier anyway (with or without amplification, depending on when I do it) but I was trying to identify which component or part of the board was in fact the source of the fault.  After about a month of back and forth, the odd voltages and the fact that the sound was there before the 7404 (it IS a pin of the 7404 that the sound goes into) and not after (I've tapped every pin of the 7404, so I know I don't have the wrong output pin by process of elimination) told me that either the cap or the 7404 was the problem, or both.  If you can tell me what the ferrite bead is, though, I can test that.  I'm pretty sure that if it's before the C23 cap that it won't tell me much, though, since the audio is still around even at the cap anyway.<br /><br />I'm told that the amplifier was the 7404.  If you know where it is *instead* I can test that.  I can tell you for sure that I get the unamplified sound but not the amplified sound.  Locating the problem or realizing where it is despite what I thought previously would be welcome.<br /><br />Anyway, I can provide photos of the board and point out what I do know on the board, if that'll help.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1288">Slipgate</a> — Mon Oct 23, 2006 3:46 pm</p><hr />

OK I looked at a NES schematic (I don't own a NES) and I see a single inverter is in PARALLEL with a resistor and cap. For now IGNORE the 7404.<br />That's right the other inverters of the 7404 are used in the CIC's oscillation and reset circuit. are you sure you're checking the right pin of the 7404 that is your inverted input? The 7404 does *NOT* amplify sound unless it's AC riding on DC which I don't think it is, it's being used as a buffer or something, CMOS stuff. Notice how the output is shorted to the input by the parallel resistor/capacitor; sound should be amplified in the RF modulator.<br /><br />Audio comes from CPU pins 1 and 2 and goes through only resistors until the ferrite bead. Audio is mixed in before it hits the ferrite bead. The ferrite bead then goes to the RLC output portion which goes to the modulator. You can intercept the audio before it hits the modulator but it will need to be amplified. The problem is probably in your amplification/modulator circuit.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Mon Oct 23, 2006 1:51 pm</p><hr />

Well, according to what I've seen, the sound will go to C23 after R7/R8/R9 (I've confirmed this since I have been able to tap the sound there) and there's a pin it's supposed to go into the 7404 on, where when it comes out it's back to the volume it should be when it goes out of the system (at that point it's travelled and become a very weak signal, requiring the volume to be up high to even barely hear it).  There IS a pin that the sound goes into, and it's been my understanding from reading about modding the sound and so on that the pin next to the one the sound goes into is the one the sound comes out of.  After that the sound can be tapped on FC1 (though my sound is already dead at that point, this is confirmed in reading about some of the stereo mods out there)... FC1 is the place it goes after the 7404, and the last stop before it goes into the little metal box where the TV and power connections are.<br /><br />As for "the buck stops" I just colloquially meant that the sound is FINE until then.  I can touch an RCA audio tip to R3, R4, R7, R8, R9, and get either the channel associated with that (for R3, R4, and the initial ends of R7 and R8) or the mixed audio at lower volume (the other end of R7 or R8 as well as either end of R9).  C23 is the next place the sound goes, and that/the 7404 is where the oddity begins.<br /><br />I'm told that the NES's 7404 deals with clock cycles for the security chip (which would seem to be fine) and sound amplification (supported by the fact that the sound does go into it).  The security chip seems fine since I'm able to play any game I want (albeit silently), whereas the sound goes in but doesn't come out.  In case the confusion was sentence order... I mean the 7404 is supposed to amplify sound, not that sound amplifies it ;).  My friend with the multimeter has the theory that the 7404 itself is fine but that the sound data is becoming crap before it gets it, although I believe I said that above.<br /><br />As for the .02 results... it was when we were testing voltages.  Everything else, the usual working stuff, was reading a normal 5v.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1288">Slipgate</a> — Mon Oct 23, 2006 1:19 pm</p><hr />

I'm very confused about what you wrote.  What do you mean by "the buck stops"? Are you talking about an inductor?<br /><br />7404 is a digital chip, a hex inverter, sound (AC) doesn't "enter" it much less get amplifed by it. I don't know what it's doing in the sound circuit unless it's being used for it's CMOS characteristics.<br /><br />0.02V sounds like either GND or an AC voltage read in the meter's DC mode.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Mon Oct 23, 2006 1:10 pm</p><hr />

Hey folks,<br /><br />I registered to ask this question.  I didn't see it on the FAQs and hopefully it's not a repetition of something here already.<br /><br />I've been having a problem with my NES where after the last time I cleaned its edge connector (I do this by opening it up and cleaning it WELL with lint-free cloths and isopropyl/water mix which I then dry off)... it worked perfectly (no odd insertions, etc.) as always after I put it back together, but the next day it exhibited silence instead of sound.<br /><br />On the inside, I've discovered that the resistors (R3 and R4) that come off the board still have the sound just fine, as do the later-on R7/R8/R9.  The last cap (C23) just before the 7404 and the 7404 itself are where the buck stops.  The unamplified sound (that the 7404 will amplify back up to normal levels) does show up on one leg of that capacitor, but not on both.  The leg the sound appears on is showing .02 volts when tested with a multimeter, while the leg that shows 5 volts is the dead one.  The unamped pin of the 7404 that the sound goes into still lets you hear the sound, but the sound doesn't come back out of the "amplified" side.  At first I thought the 7404 alone was the culprit, since the sound goes in but doesn't come back out.  However, then I saw that the capacitor had .02v on the leg that worked and 5v on the leg that didn't.  The unamped pin also shows .02v (and something DOES go in there), and the amped pin shows 5v (but nothing comes out sound-wise)... the 7404 itself "registers" as okay when tested for resistance using its ground pin and its other pin.<br /><br />I've spent a while to get to finding this much out, since I've sort of learned some stuff about voltage and resistance along the way.  My friend who actually has the multimeter suspects that the capacitor before the 7404 is not getting fully energized and the 7404 is trying to amplify a signal but that it's just too weak a signal... however, I wonder if the fact that you CAN hear something (with the volume bleedingly loud) going in means that you shouldn't at least still hear it at that volume coming out instead of losing it altogether.<br /><br />I have two specific questions.  Firstly, is the .02 voltage reading NORMAL?  The .02 (whereas working components read as 5) has me thinking that the cap, or possibly the cap and the 7404, are at fault.  I'm trying to see if one or both components are at fault by finding out if those voltage readings are normal.  One leg of the cap is .02, the other leg is 5, and the 5 leg is the one that doesn't provide sound.  The 7404 seems to be working other than sound, since there isn't anything else wrong with the system's performance.  I want to see if one or both components are rating normally or if one or both are the culprit.  I'm considering component replacement and this would be good to know.  (though I'm also considering routing the audio from R3/R4 in a sort of homebrew fix, I'd like to be able to use the system as before if possible)<br /><br />The second specific question is what may have caused this.  Naturally, I opened my NES and may have done something to it.  However, it still had sound that night.  I *was*, however, using a Honeybee converter with a Famicom cartridge of Final Mission (SCAT over here)... and it went through several reboots when I tried using that, even though the converter worked okay for other Famicom cartridges.  I'm wondering if the 5v shock that the Honeybee and other "illegit" things use to knock out the security chip might've had the effect of shorting out one or both components of these components on my NES... especially if the system was also going through rapid rebooting with said shocks.  Could this be the culprit?<br /><br />Sorry if that went long - I tried to sum up all the relevant history so far as briefly as I could.  I realize this may not be a repair forum, but if anyone here knows the answer to either of the two questions above, I would appreciate the help.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1288">Slipgate</a> — Mon Oct 23, 2006 12:49 pm</p><hr />
