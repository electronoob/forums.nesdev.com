<br />Holy Shit!  This hotel is about 2000 feet from my house.  It is in Brookfield, Wisconsin, about 20 miles west of Milwaukee.
<br />
<br />Is anyone from nesdev going to be there?  I know that there are a lot of you from Indiana.  Are any of you going to drive up?

This year I'm debating whether or not to set up a table to demo my game like I did at MAGFest.  It all depends on how much the tables are and how confident I feel spending the money on hotel room/table rental so soon after I spent boatloads at MAGFest on room/table rental/massive loads of fun stuff off the merchant floor/booze.  If you'd be interested in splitting a table with me to demo Yar's Revenge, that would be cool.  From what I remember their sizes being last year, I'm pretty confident we could fit two TV/NES combos on one table.  Let me know if you're interested.
<br />
<br />At the very least, even if I don't set up a table I think myself and my buddy I attended with last year may be going for one day like we did last year.

<br />
<br />No prob on not staying at your spot.  To be honest I didn't even think of that as an option and I completely understand your wife not being comfortable with it since we've never met.  Thanks, though.  It was nice of you to ask the Misses.
<br />
<br />I sent an email to the guy running the vendor area last week on table pricing and he said they still haven't hashed it out yet.  He told me he should know a little later this week and will email me back at that time.  So I'll keep you posted.
<br />
<br />Regarding the game demo: do you by chance have a PowerPak?  All I did at MAGFest was load my latest demo build onto my PowerPak and had people play it that way through the NES.  And if not you could always just set up a laptop (or use mine if you don' t have one) and play the ROM through an emulator.  I have a laptop and a generic controller I use to have people play stuff on an emulator when I'm demoing the game and the NES isn't handy.
<br />
<br />If any other fellow Hoosier homebrewers want to car-pool and possibly add to the homebrew table I'd definitely be up for that, as well.  I'm on the south side of Indianapolis.  I'm not sure if that works for anyone wanting to attend, but hit me up if interested.  And it goes without saying that I'd definitely be up for splitting a room.

<br />I have access to a laptop.  I have two Retrousb SNES -&gt; USB adapters that I use on my development PC for play-testing the game.  I have no problem demoing in an emulator.  I have access (via work) to a VGA projector that works well with the laptop, if the booth's lighting is conducive to this (which I doubt).  I have a 17" flat-screen CRT on my server in the basement.  I can bring that in I suppose.

<br />
<br />My name is J.D. Norman and I'm one of the organizers of the Midwest Gaming Classic, specifically for the museum wing along with Marty Goldberg.
<br />
<br />I noticed that you guys were talking about buying a table to show off your NES demos, and here's the thing... If you were trying to <strong>SELL</strong> the games at the show, then yeah, you're probably going to have to buy a table in the vendor hall.  However, if you're just interested in demoing the games without selling anything at the show, there's a very good chance we could give you a table in the game designers area free of charge.
<br />
<br />The table wouldn't come with any tickets, but it would certainly be cheaper than buying a vendor package.
<br />
<br />The exact location for the game designer area hasn't been decided quite yet, but last year it was downstairs in the VGEVO Events Room, where many of the journalists and podcasters set up shop.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you guys are interested...  I'll continue to monitor this thread, or you can PM me if you like.
<br />
<br />Later.

<br />
<br />Prices are actually set, but the big issue is whether or not we have any more space!  As I understand it, the vendors for the last several years have been quick to order space for the following year - and often more of it.  I believe they've put a few things in place to even things out and grow the area this year, but right now they're busy trying to figure out if there is any space left before selling it.
<br />
<br />That's actually one of the reasons I wanted to post here...  I wanted to give you guys some additional options in case the vending area is full.  
<br />
<br />In 2002 my duties included helping independent developers like the Dreamcast community get some much deserved exposure for their work at the show, and since then I've always been interested in giving developers a chance to show off their dev's at the show.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Damn, I haven't had a chance to look at this thread in over a day, and in that time it's exploded into twenty thousand megatons of kickass!  (Yyyyyyep!  I'm a dork.)  So much to reply to:
<br />
<br />@clueless: that's cool, those SNES-&gt;USB adapters should work well.  Then again, if memblers ends up coming, it sounds like he may be able to hook you up.  Or we could even load multiple ROMs on my PowerPak if space ends up being constrained, and take turns between the NES and laptop depending on who's doing what.  (I may duck out every now and again to attend a panel or two, if it's cool with everyone else.  And of course I'd stand guard when other people wanted to take off for a while to do some stuff).  I'm probably getting way ahead of myself here, though, as we can figure out these kinds of logistics once we know for sure who's coming/who's bringing what.  And on that point...
<br />
<br />@Memblers:  Hells yeah!!  Let's carpool!  I'm really new to the Indy area so immediately I didn't know where you were, but I just mapquested it and you're roughly five or six miles or so from me depending on where exactly you live around Beech Grove.  If you like, I just bought a Prius and I'm more than willing to drive that to save us both some money.  The thing gets awesome gas mileage, but space may be limited.  I just used it to go to MAGFest and it fit my large CRT and all my other NES gear and luggage with room to spare.  Sometime before the con we could meet up and figure out what all we can take, or if your car would be better, but I'm confident we should be able to get most, if not all, of our stuff in mine.  I do have a buddy in Chicago that's going this year, too, but he's most likely only going to want to go for one day so he'll probably drive up separately.  We haven't finalized that yet, though.
<br />
<br />@Mr. Norman: to reiterate what clueless said: yes, thank you for posting and offering your assistance.  I remember the space you're describing from last year, and it seems like it would be a great place to demo our stuff.  I don't know for sure what everyone else is planning, but I for a fact will not be selling anything.  Just demo.
<br />
<br />I've got to say I'm getting really excited about this.  It's shaping up to be a nesdev parrrrrrteeeeeee!  And I'll get to play your Yar's Revenge ROM, clueless, which will also rule.

<br />
<br />We (nesdev) should attempt to estimate how many of us would like table space so that we can let DHG Hunter know.  I propose that we, or MGC, set a deadline of when we must let MGC know how much space we would like.
<br />
<br />However, it does seem a bit early to know what we would like to ask for.  Just something to think about I guess.
