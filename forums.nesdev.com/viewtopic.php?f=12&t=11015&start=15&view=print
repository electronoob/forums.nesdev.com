		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Your understanding is correct. A address bus, B address bus, shared data bus.<br /><br />The problem here is that the expansion port only has the B address bus and data bus on it.<br /><br />If you are trying to read data out of the expansion port, you are tying up the B bus. Thus, you are reading from it. Thus, you can't write to another B address at the same time.<br /><br />The cartridge connector has both A and B on it, but that doesn't do you any good: you can't write to VRAM on the A bus, nor can you read from the expansion port on the A bus.<br /><br />So the only way to do a DMA from something into VRAM <em>directly</em> is for that something to be on the A bus, which means it has to be a cartridge chip and not an expansion port chip.

But if there's nothing to read from, or nothing to write to at that address, a peripheral could inject its own data / read from the bus at the time, regardless of what bus it's on.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah, so ... the cartridge would see a read from $50:0000 (fixed DMA from 5000000/A to 2118/B), and set the expand pin. And for each memory clock tick, the expansion port device would write data onto the shared data bus even though it's supposed to be the cartridge doing it.<br /><br />Neat. Seems like that EXPAND flag would have to be set really, really fast so you don't miss the first byte transferred.<br /><br />At any rate, the solution still requires a cartridge and expansion port device working together. So it really doesn't buy you much. You may as well put the MSU1 in the cartridge at that point. If some hardware did use this EXPAND trick, it'd certainly be a fun change to support under emulation.<br /><br />I really wanted this behavior straight out of the expansion port. Then it'd be possible to make an MSU1 base unit that could be used with any flash cart or copier device. Or even newly made cartridges. Downside there being: no support on SNES Jr or clone systems.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, there are two address busses (A and B), and one data bus (shared for both A and B). The data bus is available on both cartridge and expansion port, so both could access it. The only restriction is that expansion port doesn't have have A-bus address lines.<br /><br />So expansion hardware CAN access data bus on A-bus accesses, the only problem is that it CANNOT know WHEN it should do those accesses - unless one is doing the A-bus address decoding in the cartridge, and notifies the expansion about the decoding result via EXPAND line.<br /><br />For example, with the existing hardware: The MAD-1 decodes A-bus addresses, and does output chip selects for SRAM, ROM1 and ROM2. So one could simply wire ROM2 to EXPAND pin (that should work, except... maybe one would need to OR it with /RD signal).<br />Of course, EXPAND is only one bit wide, so the expansion wouldn't know which byte within the ROM2 region is accessed, nor if it's a /RD or /WR access. But it's enough for a simple one-way data transmission from A-bus (expansion) to B-bus registers (VRAM, OAM, WRAM, etc).<br /><br />Normally one would transfer data between snes and cartridge, or between snes and expansion. Transfer between expansion and cartridge should be working too - but I can't see what that would be good for (unless for very uncommon hardware setups), and of course such transfers would still require the snes to perform them as DMA transfers (so that the SNES CPU gets paused, and that the transferred data wouldn't collide with opcodes or other stuff on the databus).
