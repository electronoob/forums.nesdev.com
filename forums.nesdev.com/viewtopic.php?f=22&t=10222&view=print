(Only source compatibility is necessary though; not binary compatibility.)<br /><br />Another thing would be a simple music engine using MML (one more suitable to making a game than ppMCK is), compatible with expansion audio (only up to one is needed, since it is a game and not a NSF), compatible with MagicKit assembler, and can use hardware features and so on making speed up, so many of the ppMCK features can be omitted. I might write such a program.<br /><br />The feature of ENSATA to reload the ROM image would be useful to have in a NES/Famicom emulator.<br /><br />The completion of my mapper list in the wiki would be very helpful.<br /><br />A general purpose level editor/converter could also be a good idea.<br /><br />A feature of an emulator to randomize initial RAM and mapper and other things, as well as checking for bus conflicts and undefined, could help in order to check for some errors.<br /><br />Autotest feature could also be useful.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">3gengames wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1. Linux everything. Nametable editor, graphics editor, assemblers, emus, debuggers with emus, etc.</div>Software which is cross-platform would be good ideas. This is what I do; I write a C program, using the command-line mode or using SDL, in order to allow it to work cross-platform.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A social network to bring together artists, programmers, composers, and play testers.</div>Perhaps this forum, wiki, IRC, can be used? Make up some area for that if what we already have isn't suitable.<br /><br />So, in other words, there would actually be a lot of things, not just one or two.

The feature is that if you push the &quot;RELOAD&quot; menu or toolbar icon then it will restart but also reload the ROM image from the file, instead of using the copy in the emulator's RAM.

Choose the first item to reload the ROM from the file and power on.<br /><br />The other way to deal with this, the way I've tended to use on my Xubuntu laptop, is to have an emulator that either starts quickly or doesn't allow multiple instances. This way you can close the emulator, recompile, and have your makefile build the ROM and then restart the emulator.
