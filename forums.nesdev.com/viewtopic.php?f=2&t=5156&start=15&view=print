<br />Did you make sure to switch in bank 0 before reading $8000-$BFFF? It's perfectly possible to have UNROM with four banks (64 KiB PRG ROM); it's just that no commercial game was released in that configuration.

<br />Anyway, I can assume that we agree that either a new mapper or perhaps a new iNES 2.0 flag would be needed to provide the correct pattern table mirroring.

UNROM is still perfectly good if you have 16KB of PRG-ROM or less.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Did you make sure to switch in bank 0 before reading $8000-$BFFF?</div><br />It didn't matter what I did (in fact I think I only had 16KB of PRG), it refused to load the ROM. Maybe it was an old version of the emulator? I'm too lazy to test the current one, I don't have that ROM anymore.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It's perfectly possible to have UNROM with four banks (64 KiB PRG ROM); it's just that no commercial game was released in that configuration.</div><br />Yeah, I know it should be valid. But are you sure no games were released like this? I remember looking at the Zanac ROM in an hex editor and both halves looked identical. Then I cut the ROM in half and it seemed to work fine. Even in Nestopia (I just tested, it says the board is "non-standard").<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Anyway, I can assume that we agree that either a new mapper or perhaps a new iNES 2.0 flag would be needed to provide the correct pattern table mirroring.</div>
<br />Yeah, I agree.
