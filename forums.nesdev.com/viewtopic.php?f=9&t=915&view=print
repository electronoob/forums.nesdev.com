		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey everyone! This is my first post. Im from sweden so excuse my English, it isn't my first language
<br />
<br />I've been thinkning about building a nes Cartridge port to USB cart witch just really adressing and datalines (and a few more) to a USB signal and sends it to the PC and then the PC can ofcourse send signals back.
<br />
<br />Then the PC can do whatever it wants for example emulate mappers.
<br />
<br />But now to my real questions. What speeds are needed? For Example Super Mario 3. How fast does the signal need to be transfered?
<br />
<br />Edit: Read a bit more and it seems like some other people came up with simular ideas. And apparently it won't work.
<br />
<br />So if it needs 100ns isn't that only 10Kb/s witch should be possible to achive?

<br />
<br />In hardware, sure.  Software, I dunno.  You'd have to send the address/control (and data for writes) to the PC, then have the PC process that, and return the data in time.  And if you want CHR-ROM this way, then you'd have to do the same for CHR.
<br />
<br />I can't say it's impossible, but it sounds pretty difficult.  I don't know if I figured this right, but 1.789Mhz + 2.68Mhz with a memory access on every cycle I think would be 4,469,000 bytes per second.  Then maybe quadruple that to include all address and control signals.  Is that right?  That's a lot more than 10kb/s.

<br />
<br />You're off by about 3 orders of magnitude - 100ns access time would require at least 10<strong>MB</strong>/sec.

<br />That looks just what Athroh was doing in it's Flash Card project.
<br />Btw... a lot of people seems to be from Sweden here, for thoose that aren't from the united states, isn't it ? I seem to be one of the few that appears to be from neither of those.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, then i know.
<br />
<br />But i will still try my original idea witch was a NSF playback cartridge using a AVR and an SRAM. This should be no problem becouse the SRAM is the PRG ROM.
<br />
<br />So before bootup of the NES the cart is turned on and loads the playback ROM to the SRAM witch is loads from the PC trough USB.
<br />
<br />Then there will be some sort of list of all NSFs witch the host pc program provieds. When one is selected it is loaded somewere on the cart and plays.
<br />
<br />Havn't figured out really how to do this yet, but it should work. Or?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, that could work.
<br />
<br />That's similar to how an EPROM emulator works.  Except it would include a buffer between the NES and RAM, so the RAM can be taken off the bus and rewritten while it's in the system.
