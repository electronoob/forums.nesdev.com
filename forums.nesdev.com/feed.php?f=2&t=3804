I don't bash nesasm every time it's mentioned, I bash it every time it causes problems for somebody because of the weird way it handles things.  Which is, coincidentally enough, most of the time I see it mentioned.<br /><br />I can offer two very good choices over nesasm: x816 and ca65.  Why?  Because x816 doesn't have the weird habit of partitioning everything into 8k banks like nesasm does, which is only useful IF you're working with a mapper that does just that.  Not only that, it also handles 65816 code, which is perfect in case you want to migrate over to the snesdev scene.  One major disadvantage, though, is that it's apparently only available for DOS.<br /><br />ca65 is probably an even better choice, despite the fact that it spits out object files (but the linker can make binaries out of those, anyway).  It was written for a more general 6502 and 65816 crowd, and can handle not only regular and bankswitched code, but can easily handle other platforms that use 6502 or 65816 processors (perfect for me, since I also dabble with the Atari 2600 and the Commodore 64).  Not to mention the fact that it doesn't impose limits on the end user except what his/her machine can handle (and the target platform's).  And as someone pointed out earlier, it is available for many modern operating systems besides DOS.<br /><br />You're right, of course, I probably could have worded my post more tactfully.  But over the years, my tolerance for stupidity has reached an all-time low, and based on what I've heard, nesasm does a lot of stupid things, which is most likely why I went off and posted rudely.  There's just this part of me that expects things to work the way they're supposed to.  And nesasm, well...doesn't.  And this is hardly the first time I've read about somebody having problems with it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=119">doppelganger</a> — Sun Dec 30, 2007 1:15 pm</p><hr />

Well, the only reason I'm using NESASM is because I could get it to work and because it's my first program ever and the step-by-step tutorial on how to set things up was useful.<br /><br />I took an assembly class last semester and we used MASM in there, so a lot of assembly-related concepts are similar here.<br /><br />But anyway, as I had said, the issue's been resolved by using my second bank that spans from $E000-$FFF9.  I didn't know about it until talking to bunnyboy.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3374">Sivak</a> — Sun Dec 30, 2007 9:32 am</p><hr />

NESASM does everything in 8KB banks, so you just need to tell it to use more banks.  If you have a section that is too big (for example if bank 0 had 10KB) then you can skip the next bank declaration (bank 1) and it should automatically overflow into there.  I know that works for data, assume it works for code.  Be sure to change your ines header to 2x 16KB prg too.<br /><br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">  .bank 0<br />  .org $8000<br />  &#40;8KB code/data&#41;<br /><br />  .bank 1<br />  .org $A000<br />  &#40;8KB code/data&#41;<br /><br />  .bank 2<br />  .org $C000<br />  &#40;8KB code/data&#41;<br />  <br />  .bank 3<br />  .org $E000<br />  &#40;8KB code/data&#41;<br /><br />  .bank 4<br />  &#40;8KB chr graphics&#41;<br /></div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=228">bunnyboy</a> — Sat Dec 29, 2007 11:55 am</p><hr />
