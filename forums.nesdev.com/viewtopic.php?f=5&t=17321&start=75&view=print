They want a collection and the boxes all need to be the right size and the same shape and the text all lined up. Oh wait there is this silly yellow disk stuck on the end... hazah somebody has made a Box for said game and now its just like the others and its all neat and ordered and lines up and their OCD is satisfied. If you put some text on it that says &quot;This is fake&quot; that then ticks the OCD again..</div><br />Funny thing: My own OCD would be the exact opposite:<br /><br />All licensed releases need to be the right shape and size, sure.<br /><br />But a specific unlicensed release <em>has</em> to look differently. I would <em>want</em> the out-of-shape box because that's what's historically correct. That's the box that was actually sold, so it's the only one that fits into my collection.<br /><br />And when I have a &quot;Battle Kid&quot; in my collection, it <em>has</em> to be transparent green instead of opaque gray, without any kind of box because that's how the manufacturer made it in reality. A gray &quot;Battle Kid&quot; would trigger my OCD, just like a gray PRG0 revision of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;.<br /><br />And then there is an official looking &quot;F-1 Race&quot;...Wait. That's not right.<br />My OCD tells me that this shouldn't go into my list because that's not what &quot;F-1 Race&quot; looked like. It contradicts every NES game list.<br />My OCD tells me that I either have to get a Famicom cartridge or a reproduction that's labeled &quot;Reproduction&quot; to satisfy the OCD of historical correctness.<br />An unlicensed game (or a non-US game in a US shell) with a Seal of Quality on it: To me, <em>that's</em> what triggers my OCD because it doesn't &quot;fit&quot; in the sense that it contradicts my knowledge of history.

There's a standard for the box size that a lot of games do use, but there's probably at least as many that just decided to use their own.

There's a standard for the box size that a lot of games do use, but there's probably at least as many that just decided to use their own.</div><br />For my &quot;OCD&quot; this doesn't matter because historical correctness always trumps geometrical shapes. The desire to have the games as they really were produced is always more important than the desire to have them neatly ordered.<br /><br />If it's just some totally subjective thing, then I try to do it in a unified way.<br />For example, the order of my games and DVDs in my shelf are always ordered alphabetically.<br /><br />If it's something that I have actual influence over, then I also try to have it in a unified way.<br />For example, if I had found out that the artwork for my game shows Amy with a blue top and white pants, I would have immediately ordered a stop of the production of the materials. Because, as you can see in my avatar, Amy clearly has a white top and blue pants. I wouldn't have allowed the mixed-up artwork to be released.<br /><br />However, when it comes to stuff that's not my own, then historical reality always trumps general unity:<br />In &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; (USA), Mario has red pants and a blue shirt on the cover. But inside the game, he already has the new design of blue pants and a red shirt.<br />Hence, the cover is definitely incorrect.<br />But if somebody offered me a reproduction of the cartridge label where the colors are switched around, I wouldn't want it. The official cover might be canonically incorrect, but it is the cover with which the game was released, so that's the one that I want to have.<br /><br />Same with Famicom games: Different shapes and shell colors in licensed releases are simply a reality. So, my OCD would dictate me that my collection consists of different shapes and colors.
