<br />
<br />Back to topic: You still have an artifact every 30 milliseconds, though it's a lot more subtle than before. Perhaps the period divider's counter gets reset to 0 whenever you start refilling the sample buffer; the NES doesn't do that.
<br />
<br />And when code turns off the triangle channel, you're setting its output to 0. The NES doesn't do that for triangle; it just holds the wave in one position.

<br />
<br />- Just to let the things clear. There's no enigma. Tokumaru is right, I just didn't pay attention to tepples' discussion regarding the waveform from that file, and it was stupid. Since the board doesn't allow you to delete a posted message (unlike many other forums), all I can do is to delete my post and replace it with "..." for example. Plus, yes, tepples is right, it was a retraction.
<br />
<br />- Really, I don't see anything wrong in editing/erasing a bad statement. Please, don't do any early judgment of me. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />I think phpBB allows it just in case two people post at almost the same time. It appears to happen here often; see the posting and editing times for <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=68290#68290" class="postlink">this post and the one following it</a>.

<br />
<br />So, if I read you correctly...when the channel is off [true for all channels?  just the triangle?] meaning when it's length counter is zeroed [and linear counter?] the DAC value used in the amplitude calculation should be whatever it was last set to not 0?
<br />
<br />Interesting.  I'm setting my DACs to 0 when they're disabled.  I'll try *not* doing that...

<br />Goos point. Since the triangle is often used for low frequency waves, pops would be even more noticeable. The wave itself lacks (strong) higher harmonics, unlike the pulse waves, as tepples noted. It's certainly noticeable on some games which set the period to 0 how clicky it sounds. It probably would have taken just about as much hardware to zero the DAC input as on the squares, so it was intentional to have it simply stop the wave in its tracks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i've fixed the triangle resetting the position counter to 0, now it stays. there are still issues with my sound code, and i still haven't gotten around to starting the noise and DMC channel code. i decided to give the sound a rest for a while and focus on getting the main emulation bit more accurate, and fixing graphical glitches.
<br />
<br />thanks for the help. if anybody wants to have a look and run the emulator you can get it here as-is:

<br />
<br />comes with a pre-built win32 binary+sdl.dll, as well as the source code with Dev-C++ project file. i use Dev-C++ 4.9.9.2 and if you want to compile in that IDE from source you'll have to install the Dev-C++ SDL devpack found at: <a href="http://devpaks.org/details.php?devpak=200" class="postlink">http://devpaks.org/details.php?devpak=200</a>
<br />
<br />there's also a build.sh for linux, but now after opening the SDL video window in a linux build it segfaults. i don't know why, it used to work. haven't looked much into it yet. you'll need the SDL 1.2 dev libraries obviously in linux. if in a flavor of debian, just apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev
<br />
<br />the code is a bit ugly and the rendering code could use a rewrite to make much faster.
<br />
<br />i'd appreciate any feedback too. it still fails a lot of blargg's tests. one thing i'd like to get going is mapper 1, i just can't quite seem to get it right.
<br />
<br />EDIT: just want to say before reading the code makes somebody die, i know i'm missing a lot of thing still mostly in the PPU code. some pretty basic things actually like actually stopping VRAM writes when the flag is set. it will all be added soon. most games run properly though.
<br />
<br />another EDIT: since posting this, i've made it pass blargg's sprite RAM test ROM.
