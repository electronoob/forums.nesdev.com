		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />First off, New guy warning!
<br />
<br />Basically I want to make a soundtrack to an imaginary game. I intend to use a tracker, and then work on having the music play on a NES.
<br />
<br />What i want to finish with is a Cartridge, which, when you turn it on plays the music, and if possible when you press a button on a controller, changes the track.
<br />
<br />I want to work towards having a Cart with music on it, that when plugged in to the NES/Fam and turned on, works similar to an 8 track and just plays music.
<br />
<br />Like if you bought an album on Cartridge as opposed to CD or Minidisc for example.
<br />
<br />Now I need to know what are the possiblities of this, and any problems you guys can think of off the top of your heads.
<br />
<br />Since Im new to programming etc, Im in no rush and intend to spend the next few weeks just reading and maybe experimenting a bit with hex etc. Ive got quite a bit of experience with trackers, but its the software programming that is gonna catch me out....
<br />
<br />Any help!??? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A few albums have already been released this way. They included some nice sprites and things going on the screen while the music played, so that it didn't look so dull.
<br />
<br />Technically, they are not hard at all to make. If the tracker you're gonna use outputs a NSF file, it's just a matter of putting it in the ROM and calling the correct addresses at the correct times. NSFs have a "init" routine and a "play" routine. "Init" is called once to set things up and specify the song you want to play, then "play" must be called every frame.
<br />
<br />You'll need some trivial logic to have the controller change the track number and call the "init" routine with the new number whenever that happens.

<br />
<br />That's what's called a musicdisk, and they were <a href="http://pouet.net/prodlist.php?type%5B%5D=musicdisk&amp;order=&amp;x=22&amp;y=9&amp;page=1&amp;order=" class="postlink">quite common on some older computers</a>. Usually they have at least some sort of graphical interface, but you could just check for keypresses and have that change the song if you wanted to.

<br />
<br />I had a feeling it wouldnt be too difficult, but still as I'm new I felt I should ask.
<br />
<br />Ive still got some reading to do, as I want to make sure i don't get lost, but at least I know which direction to move in.
<br />
<br />I would like a graphical interface, but I guess thats what I will have to prepare for while i sort out music etc.
<br />
<br />In the mean time I need to get hold of some carts to use...
<br />
<br />Oh and thanks for the link mic_ its gonna help a lot!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> 
<br />
<br />I'll let you know how I'm getting on.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Have you seen the carts I coded for Alex Mauer? I'm pretty sure they were the first albums released on NES carts. Check them out at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.headlessbarbie.com">http://www.headlessbarbie.com</a><!-- m --> . They were some of the first NES programs I wrote and I had a ton of help the wonderful NESDEV member Tokumaru.
<br />
<br />Also, check out the new Turquoise Palace EP by Miau here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.morphcat.de/music/">http://www.morphcat.de/music/</a><!-- m --> . He has the ROM available for download.
<br />
<br />Both of these projects used NSF's exported from FamiTracker, and if I'm not mistaken someone on the NESDEV IRC channel wrote a simple app to play music back on a real NES, with the ability to change songs. I'm quite busy now but in the future I can clean up and comment some source code for you. Also, be sure to check out 2a03.org if you haven't already.
<br />
<br />Also, speaking of musicdisks, there is the totally awesome Years Behind to check out if you haven't yet: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=11918">http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=11918</a><!-- m -->

<br />Good luck!

<br />
<br />Im gonna start work on some ideas tonight and maybe work on some music ideas over the weekend also. I think if I get a few basic tracks down I can then develop my idea as I go along, then start work on coding etc.
