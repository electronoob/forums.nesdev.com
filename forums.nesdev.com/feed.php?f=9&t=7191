Actually, it was a custom part. I had them made, and they came out wrong because I mis-measured the thickness of the PCB edge. I have a retooled version lined up, but at this point, I want to get some real HW done before dumping another $5-10K into this. <br /><br />I can still order the conn and modify them for a small run if I need. I have enough tools to make it a zip, but for the final production, I will do a perfect-fit connector. One of my concerns now is height, and I don't want to pay a $5k retooling fee multiple times when the hight of the final connector is questionable. That 1mm of difference twice is ten grand. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />For example, if we use SMD components on both sides of the PCB, which seems likely, depending on the height of the components, we'll need more buffer space and thus a taller connector. I already ran into height issues with my current, modified connectors after placing all of the wires on my R0.B Vero layout. <br /><br />I also messed up a solder joint for $4016.OE somewhere along the line, or have a short, and it's causing mayhem. The next board will be a fully-realized PCB and will solve many of the present issues, but the final product needs to be ready *before* manufacturing the connectors, as otherwise, I'll not be positive about the requisite dimensions and I'll end up shelling out more and more money. <br /><br />It's one thing to break even and make it for the heck of it, but it's full another to lose ten-twenty grand to do so and I won't do the latter. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I plan to start on the R0.C PCB layout after the next rent-day; stress and design don't go hand-in-hand. I also need to create some new module entities in KiCAD to meet the needs of this project. <br /><br />When you place your order, get yourself a large sheet (8" x 8") or so of double-sided Vero with pads on both sides. You can cut it to precise fit and muck with it as needed with n wasted space. I'm not sure what you plan to make with it, but I'd like to add you to the project, as we can always use more good ideas, if you're interested.  Lastly, if you need DA-15 connectors, I have sixty+ of them, fully wired with a colour-code pinout record for easy connection.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Sat Dec 25, 2010 6:17 am</p><hr />

Thanks for the advice.  I'll have to order a couple of those next time I place an order with Mouser.<br /><br />I looked at the pics of your board and had a Homer Simpson "doh" moment.  I saw it when you originally posted some time ago, but it didn't occur to me that it was a modified ISA connector.  Remember that one guy in school who would say "I got it!" about 5 minutes after everyone else solved a problem?  That was me.   <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4242">chykn</a> — Sat Dec 25, 2010 1:50 am</p><hr />

I've done the same, modifying a connector that I had made that wasn't exactly right. If you ever want some pinout info that isn't yet in the FAQ (I haven't put it there yet, due to laziness), shoot me a PM  and if you want to involve yourself with the NESpander stuff, let me know.<br /><br />Also, as a tip, use Vero board with copper connections on both sides, as you'll need the space.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Fri Dec 24, 2010 4:20 am</p><hr />

I whipped this up tonight.  Cost around $5 in parts and 15 minutes with a Dremel to shape the connector.  Fits the expansion port like a glove, all pins have good connections.  Working on rewiring the USB keyboard adapter to run through this.<br /><br />It's an old 16-bit ISA connector.  You can either sacrifice an old motherboard or order one from one of the shops like Digikey.  Here's how I did it...<br /><br />1. Using a cutoff wheel, remove the ends so  that the length matches the port.<br />2. Very carefully cut it in half longways from the bottom.<br />3. Use a sanding wheel to reduce the thickness of the outer plastic as well as the inner plastic below the contacts.<br />4. Looking at the top of the connector, bevel the outer edges.  This way it will be easier to slide into the expansion port.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.chykn.com/nes-exp-header1-small.jpg" alt="Image" /><img src="http://www.chykn.com/nes-exp-header2-small.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.chykn.com/nes-exp-header3-small.jpg" alt="Image" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4242">chykn</a> — Wed Nov 24, 2010 12:23 am</p><hr />
