		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, hopefully this is an ok place to post this. If not, let me know!<br /><br />Over the past month or so, I've been collecting a lot of information from this forum and other websites so I could create a comprehensive tutorial that would encompass as many methods of making NES and SNES repros from donor cartridges as I could find. I tried to make it an educational tutorial as well, and tried to explain things more in-depth.<br /><br />If anyone is interested in checking it out, you can read my <a href="https://thepoorstudenthobbyist.wordpress.com/2017/06/25/how-to-make-an-nes-reproduction-cartridge/" class="postlink">NES guide here</a> and my <a href="https://thepoorstudenthobbyist.wordpress.com/2017/09/14/how-to-make-a-snes-reproduction-cartridge/" class="postlink">SNES guide here</a>.<br /><br />Any comments, criticisms, or corrections are completely welcome - I only want to make it better for people to follow and understand. I'm planning on updating the NES guide to make it a bit easier to follow - <a href="https://poorstudenthobbyist.blogspot.com/2014/10/making-your-own-nes-reproduction.html" class="postlink">I actually wrote it up about 3 years ago</a> on Blogger, there's nearly 200 comments on there from people asking questions, so I feel like it's helping at least a bit! I decided to move to Wordpress because I like their layouts better. The SNES one I just finished and I think is a lot more polished.<br /><br />(I'm not making any revenue on this, since I don't have ads through Wordpress. Just want to spread the knowledge.)
