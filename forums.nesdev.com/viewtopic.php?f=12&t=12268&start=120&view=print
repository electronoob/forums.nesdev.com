I sort of get the impression you don't understand what SpriteBuf1/SpriteBuf2 do (meaning what they're for and how the SNES uses them), but there's a 50% chance I'm completely wrong and it's just that you haven't written the rest of the code but have designed it somewhere (in which case I apologise + ignore me).  But I now understand why you want to &quot;move to 16-bit&quot; -- because the MSB (9th bit) of the Y position of a sprite is separate from the remaining 8 bits.  I now actually understand what's needed to make all of that work, but I wish I had a better idea ultimately what your goal was.</div><br />??? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" />  SpriteBuf1 has 4bytes per sprite (X and Y positions, character data, and extra) for a total of 512 bytes and Spritebuf2 has each sprites most significant X bit and sprite size selection bit, and it is 32 bytes long. SpriteBuf1 and 2 then get DMAed to OAM during VBlank.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">P.S. -- One of these days I wanna see what psychopathicteen has been working on for like the past 8 billion years.</div><br />I don't know.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@Espozo: assembler error in question is because you forgot to .exportzp the XPosition and YPosition variables within MetaspriteTest2.asm.  You have to have both .importzp (in the file where you want to use those variables) and an .exportzp (in the file where you declared them) for it to work.<br /><br />Procs (e.g. subroutines) work the same way (using .export/.import).<br /><br />Macros, however, don't work that way -- they're not procs, they're just raw code, hence why there's Macros.asm and why I put all macros in there.  And I should note that for Macros.asm, it only needs to be .include'd ONCE for the macros to be universally available, which is convenient.<br /><br />But back to variables: there is also a .globalzp ca65 directive which I didn't have time to explore or tinker with, but I wouldn't get too hung up on that right now.<br /><br />I'll use this opportunity to point out how annoying the ca65 &quot;zp&quot; stuff is, specifically because the ZEROPAGE segment is only 256 bytes long, while on the 65816 you have direct page which is up to 65536 bytes long (depending on where you place it using <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">lda/tcd</tt>).  And ca65 absolutely requires a ZEROPAGE segment (incl. in the config template).  For 6502/65c02 this works wonderfully, but for 65816 it's irritating.  Maybe tepples/thefox have some ideas on how to tweak the template to work better with it, but I simply don't.  So basically once you exhaust the ZEROPAGE segment (i.e. you exceed 256 bytes there), it's gonna start throwing errors during link-time, in which case your variables need to end up in the BSS segment (like where the SpriteBufs are).

You know psychopathic teen, have you worked on the Genesis before, because something about your art style and the fact that you are pretty much only using half of wram kind of reminds me of the Genesis. I guess the advantages to both my code that looks for tiles in vram and yours is that mine is a bit more flexible, meaning it doesn't assume every metasprite uses the same size, but I imagine is a bit more costly. (Only the sprites that are undergoing any kind of animation change are going to go through, so it shouldn't be that big of a deal.)
