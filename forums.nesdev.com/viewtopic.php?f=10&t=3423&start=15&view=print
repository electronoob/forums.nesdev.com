<br />
<br />Alrighty, if I did want to put this on real hardware (which I do), what specific steps would I take to make the rom compatible with a MMC3 mapper?  I understand the changes would be extensive, but where would I start?  Between the runtime 6502 disassembler in fcued and a hex editor I can change any pointer or value, but I really don't know where to start with changing a mapper.  Do I just change the mapper number in the header, run it, and try to fix everything that doesn't work?  
<br />
<br />Somebody said they changed mappers before - is there a tutorial on this somewhere?
<br />
<br />(I really want a hard copy of this game - pc emulation just isn't the same as the real thing)

This includes IRQ counter settings, PRG/CHR swapping, etc.  There shouldn't be all that many -- usually the game will JSR to only a handful of routines.<br />4) Decipher and document those routines and make sure you understand exactly what they are dictating the mapper do<br />5) Rewrite those routines so that they do the exact same thing, but using MMC3 instead of mapper 69.<br />6) Change the mapper number in the header.<br /><br />that's it!<br /><br />If you know your 6502 and can understand the mapper documentation, it really isn't all that hard.  Provided the mappers are compatible (which in this case... they <em>mostly</em> are, but not fully.  You might run into some problems because mapper 69 can swap each 1k page of CHR, but MMC3 can only swap 2 2k+4 1k pages.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I understand the changes would be extensive</div>
<br />
<br />Not really.  More than likely, all the routines are in the last "hardwired" page of PRG.  There's really only 2 things you have to look for:
<br />
<br />1)  mapper prep (done shortly into the reset vector)
<br />2)  swap/IRQ routines (which are JSR'd to by various points in the game)
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Also -- be sure you set up everything MMC3 needs.  <em>Including</em> enabling WRAM.  Most emus will probably let you slip by skipping that step, but the cart won't.
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT
<br />
<br />In fact... I'm kind of board right now.  I'll take a look-see to see if I can do it real quick.  I guarantee nothing, though... I get bored of romhacking very quickly.

I did this with Contra (J), and this was possible without increasing the CHR size.

<br />The European version used MMC4
<br />
<br />I changed the font, inserted the european script into the japanese rom, and retyped it using lower case letters.  It looks better, but as you can see the european translation is severely lacking in personality.  You can see in the japanese one the cat character is laughing (o-hahaha), though I still don't know what "kopyootsutsu" means.  I'm not trying to do a perfect literal translation, I just want something that captures the feel of the japanesse dialog while still being understandable and entertaining in english.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img237.imageshack.us/img237/87/showlz5.gif" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />On a side note, a few of the japanese pointers are in a different order then the european ones.  Most notably, the intro and ending sequence.  If you let the intro run it will eventually crash, so I won't be putting up a patch until I fix that.  I suppose the next item of business is getting this thing translated - I'll work on the mapper swap and gameplay hacks later.

<br />I find it less confusing to associate iNES cartridge type numbers with the <em>names</em> of cartridge circuit boards. For instance: <ul><li>0 is NROM, along with the functionally identical RROM and STROM </li><li>1 is S*ROM </li><li>2 is U*ROM </li><li>3 is CNROM </li><li>4 is T*ROM, along with HKROM aka "the StarTropics board" </li><li>5 is E*ROM aka "the CV3/Koei board" </li><li>7 is A*ROM aka "the Rare board" </li><li>9 is P*ROM aka "the Punch-Out board" </li><li>10 is F*ROM aka "the Fire Emblem board" </li><li>13 is CPROM aka "the Videomation board" </li><li>15 is "the 100-in-1 Contra board" </li><li>69 is "the Batman board" </li></ul>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Quick question:
<br />
<br />I'm working on the translation, and the intro sequence (the one that appears if you let the title screen run) is in a weird order. 
<br />
<br />This is a list of the real addresses of the text in the order it appears while the game is running, along with it's respective nes pointer in ().  There are 20 screens altogether:
<br />
<br />00: 38fe (eeb8)
<br />01: 3910 (00b9)
<br />02: 3926 (16b9)
<br />03: 3c68 (58bc)
<br />04: 3910 (00b9)
<br />05: 3932 (22b9)
<br />06: 393e (2eb9)
<br />07: 3957 (47b9)
<br />08: 3975 (65b9)
<br />09: 3993 (83b9)
<br />10: 39b8 (a8b9)
<br />11: 39d3 (c3b9)
<br />12: 3c3b (2bbc)
<br />13: 39e7 (d7b9)
<br />14: 3910 (00b9)
<br />15: 39fc (ecb9)
<br />16: 3a1b (0bba)
<br />17: 3a44 (34ba)
<br />18: 3a67 (57ba)
<br />19: 3a79 (69ba)
<br />
<br />The text at $3910 is "..........", it is repeated 3 times in the intro.  Notice that the order the text is shown when the game is running is different from the order it appears in the rom.
<br />
<br />Now here's how the pointers look in the rom (addresss $2f4f):
<br />
<br />EE B8 
<br />00 B9 
<br />16 B9 
<br />22 B9 
<br />2E B9 
<br />47 B9 
<br />65 B9 
<br />83 B9 
<br />A8 B9 
<br />C3 B9 
<br />D7 B9 
<br />EC B9 
<br />0B BA 
<br />34 BA 
<br />57 BA 
<br />69 BA
<br />
<br />All of these are in order by address.  I can't find anything in the rom's code that indicates any different order.  I tried searching for pointers to the pointers but to no avail.
<br />
<br />I'm going for a more or less accurate translation so I may not need to change the pointer order, but it would be nice to have that option.  Has anybody run into something like this before?

<br />The intro could (and probably have) been coded to something like this :
<br />Show text #5
<br />Show image #24
<br />Show text #3
<br />Show image #30
<br />etc...
<br />I just put that randomly, but the programmer just assign number to their textes and that numers are not necessary in the good order.
