		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />After the recent discussion about CHIP-8 interpreters on the NES and actual implementation of one, I couldn't help feeling a bit disappointed at how poorly designed the CHIP-8 is, mainly because of the loose speed specifications and lack of any sort of anti-flicker mechanism. The lack of interesting games to play doesn't help either.<br /><br />But the idea of simulating another machine on the NES is still pretty cool, so I was thinking if maybe there isn't an actual system out there that would be doable under the constraints of the NES.<br /><br />The first thing that came to my mind were those cheap <strong>9999 in 1 Brick Games</strong>, but unfortunately I couldn't find much technical information about them online, let alone ROM dumps. Those have a number of interesting games, and the display is dead easy to simulate.<br /><br />Another thing I thought of was the <strong>Tamagotchi and it's many clones </strong>, but each of those is only a single game, and they aren't particularly exciting to play on a TV.<br /><br />Then I started to think about more complex systems, like computers from the 70's with specs significantly lower than those of the NES, but still had a decent number of games made for them. The <strong>VIC-20</strong> immediately came to mind, because its graphics can be very charismatic, but I didn't fully understand the video hardware (the aspect ratio would be all wrong, that's for sure), and a 1MHz 6502 seems like a tall order for a 1.79MHz 2A03, unless  programs are converted via static recompilation or something.<br /><br />I couldn't help thinking about the <strong>Atari 2600</strong> too, and even though the CPU is clocked at 1.19MHz, most of the CPU time is spent on the kernel that draws the image, so if that part can be sped up somehow, maybe the game logic can run at a decent speed. Graphics are primitive, but very dynamic, and can change drastically from one frame to the next, so simulating the TIA would require a lot of tricks (including mid-screen palette changes), and the aspect ratio would be wrong no matter what. Some loss of color would occur, but the palettes are somewhat compatible.<br /><br />At this point, I'm out of ideas of what could be fun to emulate on the NES. A fun machine to implement would not only have an interesting architecture to recreate, but also software that's fun to run. None of the above candidates are ideal, for various technical reasons. Does anyone have any more ideas?

You could probably emulate a KIM-I as that probably won't need any address translation, or very little translation. Maybe an Altair 8800, PDP-11 etc. TI-99/4a yes it will be slow, but it already was <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br />If you can use hardware to help with the emulation, maybe you can put something to trap and fire an IRQ/NMI when an invalid address is requested, to give you time to translate it to something else? <br /><br />Game and Watch?

Their games were naturally quite limited. Gaming culture exploded in russia after zx spectrum got cloned.

But lots of the CPU time is spent on graphics for the ZX80, the ZX81 is a bit better I think.

Or free to do whatever you want, but compatibility is a key feature in order to be meaningful.<br /><br />I’d suggest storing and being able to edit a header along with the program file. Emulation/interpreter speed would be the most important feature. <br /><br />Back in the day i guess the few chip-8 users there were just modified programs to work with their rig. But since the NES is an absolute factor, there are more or less definitivr answers to the respective problems of each program.<br /><br />In a sense chip-8 is an intermediary step between assembly and BASIC.
