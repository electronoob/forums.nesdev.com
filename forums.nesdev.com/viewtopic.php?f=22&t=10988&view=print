Besides, creating an original game doesn't require you to use or create a suitable multicart mapper; instead, you can use an ordinary mapper.

To prepare you for this project, try reading through <a href="http://nintendoage.com/pub/faq/NA/nerdy_nights_out.html" class="postlink">Nerdy Nights</a>.<br /><br />By &quot;screenshots&quot;, I also meant in-game screenshots. Draw what each of the phases might look like, and I'll give you tips on how to respect the limits of graphics on the NES.
