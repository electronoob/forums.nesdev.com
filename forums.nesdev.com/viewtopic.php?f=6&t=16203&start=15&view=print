		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, every piece i do is meant to be either directly applied or easily converted to work with some BGM engine or another. I find it hard to motivate myself if it wouldn't be applicable.<br /><br />I don't think any of the common engine (famitone, pently) supports the fine-tune effect i'm using here, but it's easy to work around. Digression:<br /><blockquote style="margin-left: 1%; padding-left: 1%; border-left: 3px solid #555577;">
I do see *some *value in that effect as it allows me to detune/chorus independently from using an instrument vibrato &#40;making multiple vibrati instruments just with varying detunes would be size ineffective&#41;, but since vibrati tends to kick in after a while, i could in this case get away with non-vibrating detuned instruments for the short notes + gain finer control over when the detune kicks in. But it for the sake of the example file, having just one instrument for each legato/nonlegato mode was clearer.
</blockquote><br /><br />One thing i find very convenient/useful is being able to gliss x seminotes up/down over n time, but that can also be worked around, albeit uncomfortably/a bit backwards; sometime size ineffectively.<br /><br />Hi-pitch would be useful if you want percussion and/or percussive attacks on tonal notes.<br /><br />What common engines support the note off MML command? It could be used for a lot more than &quot;just&quot; simple releases

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Interesting post. It made me go in and try adding volume 0 to the beginning of some of my envelopes. I didn't like how it sounded in the context of my own music. I find that the style of attack in a volume envelope is often enough to give a punchier sound to the beginning of notes (which may or may not include a volume entry of 0 at the beginning) When I want it to sound like an instrumentalist is tonguing their clarinet or whatever I use note cuts. In other words, I don't think it necessarily makes sense to use this hammer for all nails, so to speak.<br /><br />*edit* I suddenly realized however this may be incredibly useful for fast triangle tremolo picking, so that I don't have to have different length envelopes for NTSC and PAL for instance. (thinking of a case where note cuts don't 'cut it') I'll have to try this out. Thanks for the thoughts.

For example, if the current &quot;speed&quot; is 7 frames per row (<tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">F05</tt>), <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">S05</tt> will cut it two frames early. The <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">G0x</tt> effect, on the other hand, <em>starts</em> a note x frames late. Impulse Tracker and OpenMPT have the same effects but name them <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">SCx</tt> (early cut) and <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">SDx</tt> (delay). Or you can make a volume envelope that cuts after a particular number of frames, such as <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">9 6 5 5 5 0</tt>.<br /><br />Pently has a few similar features.<br /><br /><ul><li>Pently 1 has &quot;detached&quot;, an instrument setting that cuts all notes played on that instrument one half row early. It can be heard in the cover of &quot;Leck mich im Arsch&quot; in the <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=103761#p103761" class="postlink"><em>Thwaite</em> OST</a>, as well as in several <a href="https://github.com/pinobatch/pently/blob/master/src/musicseq.pently" class="postlink">sample tracks included with the source distribution</a>.</li><li>Pently 3 (<em>Thwaite</em> and <em>Zap Ruder</em>) introduced attack envelopes in imitation of FamiTracker volume, duty, and arpeggio envelopes. If an instrument's sustain volume is 0, it will stop when the attack envelope completes. Setting <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">volume 9 6 5 5 5 0</tt> on an instrument makes all its notes 5 frames long.</li><li>Pently 4 (<em>RHDE</em>) introduced <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=128821#p128821" class="postlink">grace notes</a>, a generalization of S0x and G0x. A row's duration can be set in frames instead of fractions of a whole note using the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">1g</tt> through <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">9g</tt> durations. The following row plays for the remainder of the original row. To play a note that cuts early, use <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">f#4g r8</tt>, which plays an F# for 4 frames before cutting it and lasts a total of an eighth note. To start a note late, use <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">w4g f#8</tt>, which waits four frames and then plays an F#, taking a total of an eighth note. It's called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_note" class="postlink">grace note</a> because acciaccatura happens if you make both events notes instead of waits or rests.</li></ul>
