BTW, these emulators are far from being benchmarks of accuracy. If you want better predictions of what the real hardware might do under uncommon situations, try Nintendulator or another emulator that actually simulates the internal logic of the PPU to the letter.<br /><br />I honestly don't know what to expect visually, but there's no way this will simply work. In the best case scenario you'll get a corrupted OAM, which means garbage sprites until you rewrite the OAM properly, but I guess it could interfere with something else and end up corrupting more than just the OAM.

This extends to DMA transfers via OAMDMA, since that uses writes to $2004. For emulation purposes, it is probably best to completely ignore writes during rendering.<br /></div> (emphasis mine). You &quot;should&quot; get garbage on the scanlines during which writes happen, and otherwise nothing else visible.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Running DMA mid-frame will produce about 4 lines of glitchy effects. Not exactly useful. I've tested this on an Everdrive cart on the real hardware. Even if you disable sprites and run it, it still visibly glitch (unlike on the GameBoy). Updating DMA mid-frame can be useful, but I'm not sure of a way to do it on the NES without glitches.<br /><br />If you want to see really &quot;Bad Things&quot;, try setting your palette to $0D... gasp. Actually, I HAVE noticed this black to produce a darker black than the regular $0F black on my CRT tv. Looks quite nice... until your TV explodes.

If it's done on an area that is one tile high (8 pixels) could the palette just be quickly written to be all black before the transfer? <br /><br />If $0D looks darker than $0F, then your TV set is not tuned correctly. $0F should be true black, while $0D should be a signal that the TV would consider &quot;less than black&quot; which will upset the sync circuitry which uses negative voltages for sync information.

This is a mid 1980's Sony with contrast, saturation, and brightness. $0F is still black, I'm just saying that on my set $0D makes it even darker, in that there seems to be less glow from surrounding palettes. Probably not noticeable without the lights turned off though. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Four lines of glitchy effects, rendered with palette colors? </div><br />I recall them being black/white, but I could re-check this with different palettes.
