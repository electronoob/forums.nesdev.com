(just a guess)<br />This possibly puts the MFG date to 1989 or maybe early 1990, when famiclones were worth to be well-made just like this one.<br /><br />As an totally off-topic joke, when I was a teen I had many weird dates!<br />But I never tried to date a famiclone!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" />

I'm not certain how they would have encoded 1990, however. &quot;HH&quot; might mean august of 1998???<br /><br />The 7805 on the heatsink will likely also have a date code.<br /><br />The 26th week of the year is the last week of June. The 36th week of the year is the first week of September.

I can't see how these would have competed against all the clones flooding the market at that point.<br />Even good clones from 1993 seems cheaper versus what you're showing.
