		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, I have a question. If I would take a famicom cart connector and solder it onto a pal nes, skipping (or grounding) security and expansion pins, would such nes play famicom games? Provided of course that the lockout chip on nes would be properly disabled (grounded). 
<br />
<br />I'm looking at this pinouts as a reference:

<br />
<br />Seems like a painful way to plug in a cart though.  There are NES adapters for FC carts, though I don't know where to get one.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's nice to hear. I'm thinking about it mostly because I don't know where to _easily_ find an adapter here, and because I have a load of famiclone carts which could be fun to play on a real NES (hi quality pads with long cables, multitap).  And I have a spare NES too. Not mentioning the joy of soldering...
<br />I presume using a famiclone cart connector (and games) instead of an original japanese famicom ones is not a problem? 
<br />
<br />Looking forward to playing 999999 in 1 on a NES <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

That's the patent term. Copyrights and trademarks last longer than this: <ul><li>20 &lt; 95.

<br />eBay is way ahead of you. Its <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/importation.html" class="postlink">policy on the importation of goods</a> lists "A video game player or software that is the Japanese version of the player or game and not intended for use in the United States" as an example of a potentially infringing item.

<br />you would want one that goes the other way though, or i guess old gyromite carts or similar one have an adapter already inside them.

However, it took me a really long time to find a 60 to 72. I found it inside an old Stack-Up cart. I actually bought a Gyromite cart because I heard they came inside of those, but to my disappointment, I opened it to behold a plain old NES board with no converter.
<br />
<br />If you do find a cart with a converter inside of it, you'll have to saw these things off the sides of the converter in order to stick a famicom cart with it's case on in it. If you don't remove this things from the side, you'll have to take famicom games out of their case in order to put them into the converter.

<br />Yes, I know all about those God-forsaken infinite copyrights. That's practically all I ever read about here anymore. I <em>personally</em> think it's extremely stupid and pointless to restrict sales of adapters and games for a system that has not even been in production for 15 years (at least in the US).
<br />
<br />I guess it's a good thing I don't use eBay anymore.

<br />I've been looking for an alternative to ebay for some time. Specifically for video games and systems. Ebay seriously sucks now, and I avoid it as much as possible. If there is no alternative, its time for ebay to get some competition.

<br />They sort of hint that any device allowing play of an imported game is against their policy (the "these devices" is kind of ambiguous), but I'm pretty sure they don't blanket all devices that allow play of import games.  
<br />
<br />They sure don't seem to mind people selling crappy famiclones.  I purchased my game converters from someone on ebay, and I've seen coverters of both direction come up there once in a while.
