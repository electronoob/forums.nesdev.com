The whole idea is a place where you can find the homebrews that you would like, and no place has a proper way to do that without having to download and play EVERY homebrew, which is kind of impossible.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The problem with making it as attractive as Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Steam, or the console app stores is that this sort of visually attractive layout requires a lot of art resources to be associated with each app. I'm guessing at least these will be required: an icon, 2-5 screenshots, possibly a video or two, and a manual. Given how programmer-heavy this scene is, I'm not entirely sure all homebrew developers would have the resources to create high-quality art to promote a downloadable game, particularly one not quite as ambitious as <em>Nova the Squirrel</em>. And if they do, it's the sort of game that gets a cartridge release rather than a downloadable one.<br /><br />Creating the video in particular would require us to figure out what emulators that run on Windows, macOS, and X11/Linux can output video of acceptable quality. Wine isn't a quick answer because many emulators' video output feature works in Windows but fails in Wine.

You see a game you like then you download the demo. Then you want to buy it either in digital form or cartridge form. So on the game page there is a link to the authors website with details on how to buy the game. It's all about bringing business to the developers. <br /><br />Releasing a demo is perfectly fine and I honestly like to play it a little before I take the plunge with my wallet. There doesn't have to be promotional art or a manual to show off if the author doesn't want to. All you need are some screenshots. A youtube video would be nice and even if the author doesn't know how to make a youtube video they can always provide a link to someone else who did some gameplay and maybe a good review. <br /><br />I think this website should be for all homebrew not just NES, but all systems. It would be really nice to be able to find whatever you want all on one site.

We have many wiki articles about various homebrews too, but it's very sparse and inconsistent.<br /><br />Database features are cool, but they're not useful until you have maintainers who will put data into them. ;P
