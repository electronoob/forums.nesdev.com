		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am highly, highly impressed with this. I can't wait to see a stable build come into existence.<br />But first, a few questions I'd like to ask:<br />1) How exactly does the 3D rendering work? After watching a few videos of your emulator at work, I am curious as to how the depth works.<br />2) Does extra code need to be written for every NES game? That seems improbable because so many of them exist, but it seems a little weird to me that the code for the games themselves would have the data for such a task.<br />3) Does the emulator alter the code of the games themselves? This seems likely to me, but I'm new to programming in general, so this could be due to ignorance on my part.<br />Other than that, this looks really cool. Great work so far, my man.

In the future, in its complete form, the emu will have a set of coefficients, and we could do adjustment for a specific game by modifying this set, that's the limit. <br />3) No, the emu is a normal emulator plus a realtime 2d-&gt;3d converting engine. That's all.

And I really like that the emulator actually analyzes the images to give them proper 3D models, instead of just stretching them on the Z axis. I know it's a work in progress, but do you have a compiled version or something, that we can try out? I love experimenting with this kind of stuff and would like to see how a lot of games would look, running on this. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Good job! <br /><br />It seems the emulator now detects when a front sprite tile is covered by a background tile and changes the background tile to semi-transparent. And after a short period of time, moves that background tile to the back. I suggest changing the length of the time period based on the size of the overlapping area. So if most of the pixels of the two tiles overlap each other, then reduce the time period. I also suggest lowering the opacity of the semi-transparent background tiles so that the sprite tile covered by it will be more visible.<br /><br />I can also see that detection algorithm have problems with chr ram games because there are multiple copy of the same tile in the ram. Maybe you can check for repeated tiles by comparing the tile pixels.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks @mkwong98 <br />You got it right. This is the basic idea of z layer processing. Concerning your suggestion: <br /><br />- Overlapping area detection in detail is a costly processing. For the time being i just check two shape overlap each other or not. And things sometime are quite complicated. For example in Castlevania, the bat moves in sin wave and goes completely through the ground for a sort period of time but we can not put the ground in the far layer. <br />- About the opacity and visibility, i will recheck it all. <br />- About chr ram game, do you see problem or guess it? Because i already define tile identity by it own pixel data.
