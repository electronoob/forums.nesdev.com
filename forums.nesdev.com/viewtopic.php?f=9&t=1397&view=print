		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi guys. I have successifully completed 2 NROM devcarts so far, but that was easy because they didn't need any rewiring for use with the Flash ROMs I have.
<br />
<br />Yesterday, I tried something more difficult, and removed the ROMs of a TLROM cart. The largest chips I have around are W27E512, wich are 64KBytes and can be erased with the EPROM programmer. I figured it'd be OK, I'd be using half the capacity of the board, but that's OK.
<br />
<br />This chip's pinouts go like this:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;---_---<br />A15 - |01&nbsp; &nbsp;28| - Vcc<br />A12 - |02&nbsp; &nbsp;27| - A14<br />A7&nbsp; - |03&nbsp; &nbsp;26| - A13<br />A6&nbsp; - |04&nbsp; &nbsp;25| - A8<br />A5&nbsp; - |05&nbsp; &nbsp;24| - A9<br />A4&nbsp; - |06&nbsp; &nbsp;23| - A11<br />A3&nbsp; - |07&nbsp; &nbsp;22| - OE/Vpp<br />A2&nbsp; - |08&nbsp; &nbsp;21| - A10<br />A1&nbsp; - |09&nbsp; &nbsp;20| - CE<br />A0&nbsp; - |10&nbsp; &nbsp;19| - Q7<br />Q0&nbsp; - |11&nbsp; &nbsp;18| - Q6<br />Q1&nbsp; - |12&nbsp; &nbsp;17| - Q5<br />Q2&nbsp; - |13&nbsp; &nbsp;16| - Q4<br />GND - |14&nbsp; &nbsp;15| - Q3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-------<br /></div>
<br />I was happy, because it almost matches the NES ROM, except pin 22 is not A16, it's OE. Since I usually see OE beeing connected to GND, I did that, and left hole 22 empty.
<br />
<br />As for the CHR part, It puzzles me why Nintendo used different chips if they are the same size. Does anyone know why? Anyway, if I placed my chip on the bottom 28 pins, CE and  OE would be on the wrong place, and would have to be soldered to holes 31 and 02, respectivelly.
<br />
<br />It all seemed fine to me, except it didn't work. All I got was a grey screen. I wasn't upset or anything, 'cause I kinda expected that to happen. Do you see anything wrong with what I did? In the PRG chip, is OE supposed to be connected to GND? Does anything else need to be done?
<br />
<br />Thanks for the help again.
<br />
<br />Oh, and what does an "/" mean on these pinouts? I don't understand why there is a pin (31) in the CHR ROM labeled "/A13".

<br />
<br />But for me... I'm kinda guessing here, based on the documented rewiring, but I must have done something wrong, since I can't get it to work. Can't you point to me what I did wrong?
<br />
<br />I don't know if you have to do something about the empty holes or you can just leave them like that... I don't know exactly what to do when no CE or OE pins/holes are present... And you know, it's kind of hard for me to get new carts to modify, and I'd like to go through this without making any of them useless...

If you're putting a 28-pin ROM into a 32-pin socket, the rewiring guides probably don't cover that case.  Best thing to do would be to view your chip's datasheet/pinout and compare it to the pinout of the ROM you're replacing.
<br />
<br />At any rate, both /CE and /OE must be hooked up to something.  Two possible ways, first is to connect /OE to GND and /CE to the PRG/CE pin on the board.  Or connect /CE to GND and /OE to PRG/CE.

<br />So inverting them is a possibility? Man, I'm feeling kinda stupid. Only one pin doesn't match, this should be a simple modification.
<br />
<br />BTW, is the "/" we see in these ASCII pinouts the same as a line above the pin name, as seen in PDF datasheets?

<br />It sounds like that should've worked.  What program do you have in the chip then?  I would take a 16kB game and duplicate it until it fills the ROM up, so you'd know the mapper settings won't be able to crash a game.
<br />
<br />And yeah, Nintendo's 128kB ROMs are 28-pin, I don't know why the CHR ones are 32-pin though.

I didn't want to go through the trouble of slicing a MMC3 game down to 64k and have it still work. The repeated SMB ROM worked fine with emulators.

<br />Very weird, IMO.
<br />
<br />When I get home today I'll double check everything. Maybe I'll try this chip with the NROM cart, just to verify it works. And then when (if) I get PRG to work I'll try and figure out the problem with the CHR chip.
<br />
<br />I just thought of something: is there a possibility that Vcc for this chip is not 5V? The datasheet I have for it is very cryptic, unlike the ones I found for my Flash ROMs, wich are very clear about the 5V. EDIT: I think I found it, it seems to be 5V, so that is not a problem.

<br />
<br />I don't feel like ruining another board anytime soon, so I'm open to ideas on ways to try rewiring until I find the correct/working position of every pin and can solder the whole thing for good.
<br />
<br />How do you manege to desolder a socket anyway? With the chips I found it easy since you can heat the pins from the chip side of the board and use a solder sucker on the other side. But with the sockets there is little or no visible part of the pins to heat up on the chip side. Sucking from the same side as the soldering iron never gets all the solder out.
<br />
<br />I tried to get an iron with a sucker attached, but I didn't find anything like this here. I found some really expensive (around $400) soldering stations, but those are way out of my price range and are probably much more than what I need.

I've even taken out mapper chips and wired them to other boards and just left the PCB portion hanging loose in the plastic cartridge and it works fine. Don't throw out your "wrecked" cart.

<br />I looked so much for one of those and couldn't find any. No stores here have desoldering irons, only (de)soldering stations wich are waaaaaaaaaaay more expensive... I guess I'm stuck with the regular iron and the pump/sucker.
<br />
<br />I saw some sockets with longer legs the other day, I guess I'll buy some of those, as they'll allow me to tweak the connections more freely and test what works for a specific chip, before making permanent connections, with regular sockets.
<br />
<br />Thanks for the help.

It comes in different colours which is convenient. You can buy a wire wrap tool which makes it really easy to use. It's pretty cheap as is the wrapping tool. Both Amazon and RadioShack have cheap desoldering irons around $10-$13 USD. I don't know if they deliver to Brazil or for how much.
