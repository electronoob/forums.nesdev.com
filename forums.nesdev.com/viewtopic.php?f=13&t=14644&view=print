The spambots will always be with us unfortunately, but usually they're not as blatant.  Sometimes they just copy other people's posts and weird stuff like that, presumably to build a credible looking account, or to insert links into their signature.

In the past, I've been told that's easier because hiding the posts keeps the spammer's IP and other identifying information more readily accessible than deleting them would.<br /><br />There were three accounts posting this garbage. I b&amp; all three, and I hope that what Memblers did will keep them from coming back.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah I've been in the habit of deleting the spammer accounts and posts (been doing it since the start of the forum, though it's an unwinnable battle, the userlist is polluted).  When you delete the account and retain the posts though it gets rid of any useful identification.  Maybe I should break that habit?  By that I mean just hide the posts in the hidden spam section.  I've always been kind of assuming that most spammers are &quot;drive-by&quot; and don't come back, which is why it usually didn't seem like accumulating their &quot;fingerprints&quot; would help.

And WoahMan has done some changes as well, so hopefully we'll start to see the end of this little shit-storm.  For now.
