		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Whether the use of color $0D and/or emphasis bits is problematic varies widely from TV to TV. When I was testing voltages for the <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=159262#p159262" class="postlink">IRE test</a> for Tepples's test suite, even the combination of $0D and emphasis did not screw up the horizontal timing on the 2006-era TV I was using at the time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've seen the many different responses from TVs and capture devices I've tested with an $0D colour signal:<br /><br />1. Wobbly areas of the screen in horizontal strips. (loss of horizontal blank integrity?)<br />2. Wobbly/rolling screen in general. (loss of vertical blank integrity?)<br />3. Drops the signal entirely. (probably same as 2 but for a TV that's converting to digital)<br />4. $0D rendered at same colour as regular black.<br />5. $0D rendered slightly darker than regular black.<br />6. Introduction of $0D causes the black level to renormalize after several seconds, causing a slow transition from 4 to 5 as it becomes the &quot;new&quot; black.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I've had Everdrives for well over a year now and I finally got around to patching a ROM with these fixes. It works, but it seems that we missed one.<br /><br />First I tried these:<br />Battle screen<br />YEXNPNIE<br />0001F7B9: 0D 0F<br /><br />Title screen<br />YEKNPNIE<br />0001F7D9: 0D 0F<br /><br />Walking screen<br />YEVNPNIE<br />0001F7F9: 0D 0F<br /><br />Sprite<br />YEVNTNIE<br />0001F7FE: 0D 0F<br /><br />Just after the wizard raises his staff, the screen flashes. This consistently causes it to lose sync on one of my displays. I added the ones we were wondering about (let me know if I got the GG encoding wrong):<br />Unknown 1<br />YESNZNIE<br />0001F7EA: 0D 0F<br /><br />Unknown 2<br />YESNLNIE<br />0001F7EB: 0D 0F<br /><br />Unknown 3<br />YESNGNIE<br />0001F7EC: 0D 0F<br /><br />It still happens. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />I loaded it up into FCEUX and frame-stepped that part until the PPU viewer showed all black. Sure enough, many of the palettes show 0D when I mouse over them. I don't know how to find the offset in ROM from that though.<br /><br />Edit: Got it! I my hex editor I saw a pattern of 00 and 0D that looked very similar to what I saw when mousing over the palettes in the PPU viewer. Changed those all to 0F and now it works!
