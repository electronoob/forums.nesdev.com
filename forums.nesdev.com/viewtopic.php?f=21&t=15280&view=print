Those stalactites could use some more depth too, they look flat compared to other things that are done in the same style (like the rock outlines and the brick outlines). Other than that, all of the scenes are nice and colorful and have great detailing, very good work, I can't wait to see more. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

The new texture looks way too nonsensical for representing leaves.<br /><br />The underwater is pretty cool, I love the little shadow below the waves on the surface, it gives the water some volume. One thing I didn't like though is that platform that's only partially covered by water... It doesn't make any sense because the presence of grass indicates that the top of it is unobstructed, meaning there's nothing to hold the water where it is. It looks weird. It would be better to end the grass along with the water, IMO.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the large sandstone bricks look too wiggly; if you remove the bezel decoration on the front, they could easily pass as compacted snow-bricks. The black shadow also looks like it's too far forward, if you were going for a backlighting effect, so it ends up looking a little out of place.<br /><br />The pyramid interior could benefit from some more contrast in the palette, the shadowed color is too bright and it makes the entire scene look flat, and like with the bricks, the black shadow on the pedestals is too far forward and looks out of place; all you need to do is push it farther to the right (almost up against the edge) and it'll look fine.<br /><br />I really dig that nighttime scene; that horizon looks like it could strongly benefit from some the silhouette of some sandy hills against the gradient, not unlike the shape that's right above the water in the oasis scene. I might be wrong, but it seems like a neat thing to try out; you could also use it to hide the artifacting caused by the gradient tiles running into the diagonal sand tiles.<br /><br />The volcano environment looks neat too, but you may want to consider scrapping the purple haze, since you're going to run into more cut-out artifacting as foreground objects need to be placed overtop of it, unless you can come up with some creative way to mask it, of course.<br /><br />I hope this criticism doesn't sound too negative; I really am enjoying all of the art you're posting so far.
