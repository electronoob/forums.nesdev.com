<br />The carry flag and the overflow flag are entirely different things. In a way, the C flag can be used to detect unsigned overflow, while the V flag is used to detect signed overflows. If an addition causes a number to go past 255 and wrap back to 0 and up, that‘s an unsigned overflow, and the C flag will indicate whether this happened or not. But when a number goes past 127 and wraps back to -128 (or vice versa), that‘s a signed overflow, indicated by the V flag.

<br />I take the the unsigned number and adc the positive value of the signed number if it's positive or sbc the positive value of the signed number if it's negative. At least that's what I'm planning to do on my objects core. I think this way you can use the normal flags.

In some cases, like when comparing multi-byte signed integers, you must treat the lower bytes as unsigned, and only the most significant byte as signed (i.e., the carry flag is used to propagate overflows up until the highest byte, and only when the last byte has been calculated you can expect something meaningful in the V flag).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You can BIT any RTS to set N to 0 and V to 1.</div><br />You mean BIT an RTS ($60) instruction?

<br />The CPU doesn't know anything about "banks", so no. Pages are sections of 256 bytes. $8000 is the start of one page, $8100 is the start of the following page, for example. Some instructions take longer to execute when pages are crossed because the CPU needs more time in order to update the high byte of the address as well as the low byte.

<br />I'm sure he meant exactly what it looks like, making up for the lack of a SEV instruction by using BIT against some value of $60 sitting somewhere in the code.  RTS is $60.

<br />Ah, okay. So then, if it crosses 2 pages, does that mean it takes 2 more cycles? Are there any time-critical procedures that are must be explicitly designed not to cross page boundaries?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Questions:
<br />1) When linking, the ines header goes at $0000. To play the game on an emulator, does that mean that all the other segments must be offset by $10? That is, the zero page starts at $10 and ends at $110 instead of it's normal range?
<br />2) On starting up, what's the status of all the flags? Is it common practice to simply clear them? What about the PC/SP/AC/X/Y ?
<br />3) Somewhat unrelated, but I'll ask anyways. I have the opportunity to get my hands on a real NES, but it doesn't work. Iirc, the power cable is broken/touchy (It needed to be bent in just the right position for it to work.), and the screen will just blink/oscillate when I did manage to get the power to work. What kind of thing would cause the second problem, and how much would replacing the first cost?

<br />
<br />2) Do not depend on the flags at the time of reset. You'll usually end up clearing X, S, and half of P in the first six instructions anyway. All you can be sure of is that PC points where $FFFC-$FFFD says.

<br />
<br />3) The official NES adapter outputs 9 V AC, but it can run just as easily on the -9 V DC that a power supply for the original model Sega Genesis makes. Or you could buy a universal adapter and configure it for -9 V DC.
