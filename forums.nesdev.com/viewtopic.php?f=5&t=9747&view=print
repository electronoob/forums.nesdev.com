As is the case with the forum, the code can't differentiate between code and other text, so it highlights everything.<br /><br />--<br /><br />This is a GreaseMonkey user script that enables syntax highlighting on this forum. It also modifies the forum titles so that the post title always comes first (making tabbed browsing easier).<br /><br />In Firefox, you need the Greasemonkey add-on to use this. In Google Chrome, it should work out of the box, <strong>but only if you switch to the dev channel!</strong><br /><br />* To install in Chrome, download the file, open the extensions view (chrome&#058;//extensions/), and drag &amp; drop the file in there.<br />* To install in Firefox, download Greasemonkey, choose Manage User Scripts, and drag &amp; drop the script into the list.<br /><br />Here's the old &quot;after&quot; result, the color scheme has changed a bit since then:<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

Basically it would be just a matter of including a couple of JavaScript files, some CSS files, and adding a BBCode tag to generate a &lt;pre&gt; tag with a special class name.</div><br />I'm fine with either client-side or server-side.  The problems with client-side is that more often than not these things end up chewing/wasting CPU time in such a way where interactivity is hindered in some way; i.e. &quot;I just got back a bunch of HTML, and now I need to parse a bunch of HTML and turn it into some other HTML, so while I do this you won't be able to click on anything or adjust pulldowns&quot;.  Throw JavaScript into the mix and now it's even scarier.  Varies per browser of course, but you get my point.  The server-side solution involves figuring out the phpBB bits and if it even supports doing that, but has the added advantage that the results look the same for everyone (including search engines/crawlers) and there's no &quot;if you want it to look like this you gotta install this software/extension/script&quot; nonsense.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Dwedit wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Any chance of a userscript/greasemonkey version?</div><br />Nope, not from me, sorry.</div><br />Reason I'm quoting two things in one: because &quot;a couple of JavaScript files, some CSS, etc.&quot; is exactly what GreaseMonkey scripts would do (although for sanity you really need to keep everything in one single script).  I have some familiarity with GreaseMonkey scripts since <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/154089" class="postlink">I maintain a public one</a>.<br /><br />I don't use Chrome thus the .crx stuff does me zero good.  (I like Chrome mind you, I forced myself to use it for a week, but there were UI bits/pieces that I could not stand and I hate tabbed browsing like you wouldn't believe)

But in this case I needed to use multiple source files so this way was easier. And I wanted to learn a little bit in the process too.<br /><br />Anybody is free to take and modify the source to work with Greasemonkey though, it's all in the CRX and it's pretty short (except for the actual SyntaxHighlighter engine).
