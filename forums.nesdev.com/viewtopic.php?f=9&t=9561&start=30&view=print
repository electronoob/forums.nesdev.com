		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I like how this is basically the only project I've ever seen that attempts to achieve RGB output using a palette close to the composite palette without using full-system emulation (as opposed to the RGB PPU palette). I enjoy switching Nestopia back and forth between RGB and composite palettes, and between a soft non-artifacted output (resolution all the way up but sharpness all the way down) and the default composite artifacting. Sometimes I even do RGB palette with composite artifacts just for shiggles <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

I have an RGB modded Famicom and I have been brainstorming ideas for ways to get around the limitations of the RGB PPU when it comes to game compatibility due to emphasis, or even just the palette differences with some games. If you can get this to a point where you can provide manufactured boards that output RGB this would truly be the perfect solution! I will be following this thread hoping that day comes. Most of this is beyond my abilities or understanding, so I apologize if this is a stupid question, but do you get any sort of lag when output to vga? Again I think this is really great work and hope it develops into something more.

But a switch of some kind could be implemented that could be used to switch between different output formats.<br /><br />...<br /><br />In any case, like I said previously, it's going to take a while until I can turn this into a commercial product, because I have zero experience with custom PCBs, and I'm not too thrilled about investing a bunch of money into prototyping because of that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So what you're saying is there's a way to switch between possible video output formats?  That would be excellent.  I think people would love to have some way of being able to change the type of video format that it's outputting.  You don't need everything at once but atleast having the ability to change between s-video / rgb / component / hdmi would be excellent.  I don't mind waiting for this to get done.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From what I've been reading, this uses Nintendulator's palette settings, right? Well, a couple years back, I worked on a custom NES palette that came as close as I could possibly get it to looking like the original NTSC NES colors in games. I used both a Sony Trinitron CRT and a Sony LCD to cross reference my entire collection of over 100 NES games (including all 6 Mega Man games and every stage in each) with my front-loader's composite out jack. The result is the only palette in my opinion that actually looks like the output from my real hardware. Now of course this is still subjective even with my best efforts to make it as accurate as possible, but I've yet to find a better palette.<br /><br />Every now and then I get a request for the link, so if interested, here's the link to the palette file and the bitmap samples image:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.firebrandx.com/downloads/fbx3pal.zip" class="postlink">http://www.firebrandx.com/downloads/fbx3pal.zip</a><br /><br /><img src="http://www.firebrandx.com/downloads/fbx3pal.bmp" alt="Image" />
