If you hear someone complaining about magnetic ballast fluorescent lights, they may well be seeing stroboscopic effects or complaining about color rendering index or sound but they are unequivocally not seeings the 120Hz (US) directly.<br /><br />The other is the ability to detect phase difference, which can easily go up to this 240Hz, or more accurately, down to 4ms. Detecting phase difference is plausible is other cases, but is entirely different from what you see when you look at a CRT.</div><br />It's trickier than that still, how much the perception of light stays depends on how strong it was (and probably which color). I recall once making a game which was mostly dark but had white dots as stars, and when scrolling around they'd leave a trail. Taking into account the length of the trail and the game framerate, those dots lasted like around 1/12th of a second. There's no way a CRT has that much of a latency, so it obviously has to be the eye playing tricks there.<br /><br />In any case I never received any complaints at all about the flickering trick on a CRT (the only time I did was on an emulator and I doubt the monitor refresh rate was 60Hz), so maybe it looking horrible is specific to the NES hardware or something. The whole dot crawling thing on the NES may affect it possibly. Again, it only works fine when the two colors are relatively similar shades (e.g. not more than 25% away per component in the RGB scale) and if it's a checkerboard pattern (other patterns are just way too noticeable, especially things like stripes).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, I'm new to the site and to NES Dev in general, and I was wondering something... Could you mix the sprite layering thing with the use of meta-sprites to get even more colors? I have an example that I made of what I'm talking about. I took a sprite of link from Zelda 2 for the NES (Which I always thought could use some improvement) and adjusted it to illustrate my point. I am wondering if this could even be done. Has it been done? If so can anyone think of an example? Are there any problems that come up with doing this? If so I assume it would have something to do with sprite limits on the screen or something. It is a pretty significant increase in the number of colors. The original sprite has 3 plus transparency and the new one has 10 plus transparency. That's quite a difference, and I dare say it almost looks like SNES or GBA graphics! I also, have the sprites separated in such a way that if the palette of green were swapped out for the red one or the blue one it changes the color of his clothing. I Assume they would have used some of these techniques but at the time this game was made I bet the tech wasn't good enough or something. I'm thinking if this were at all possible it would probably require the use of some kind of memory mapper chip or something. Am I right by thinking this? Thanks all for your help and comments.

If you think you can, go ahead, but you have been warned.<br /><br />EDIT: also yes, 4 palettes of 3 colors each... for each layer. So it's four palettes for sprites and four for backgrounds (eight total). Also the transparent color acts as an extra color for background tiles.<br /><br />Reusing colors is not that hard anyway =P

That term is usually used to mean that the hardware's 8x8/8x16 sprites are combined to form bigger (meta)sprites (to coincide with the term metatiles -- combining 8x8 background tiles to form bigger (meta)tiles).<br /><br />So I fail to see what's different about &quot;LAYERED&quot; and &quot;META-SPRITE&quot; in your picture.

Aparently, some have assumed that &quot;meta-sprites&quot; means sprites drawn with background tiles, which is not what we usually mean.<br /><br />If that's indeed the idea, I don't think it's very practical. Moving that sprite will be much more difficult (because of the pattern and name table updates), and you'd have to give up on backgrounds. I see little advantage in having a few SNES-like sprites if that meanshaving dull backgrounds and few palettes available for everything else.<br /><br />IMO, sprites with a few overlayed details is the best compromise.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I believe &quot;meta sprite&quot; is referring to a sprite that does not have overlapping tiles, but gives many different tiles their own palette. Confusing terminology, but I think that's what it means.<br /><br />My only comment is that you need to have more than just Link on the screen, obviously. Sprite tiles and palettes are usually worth conserving a bit more than that. It should work fine by itself though.

You guys are great!</div><br /><br />I was thinking about this and I think it should be feasible (i.e. you could still have an actual game) if you put a limitation on the graphical style where sprites can only move within a solid color space (color 0) - this would make it much easier to render the dynamic BG tiles containing the extra colors outside of vblank, and prepare a kind of &quot;display list&quot; for the vblank routine so it could make the updates as fast as possible.  And you should limit the player's character size to 16x16.  Maaaybe 16x24.  Additionally, with a very large ROM, the horizontal-shifting part of the process could be pre-calculated, speeding the effect up dramatically.<br /><br />The solid BG color limitation would be well-suited to a game set in a cave, or underwater, or maybe a piece of copy paper. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
