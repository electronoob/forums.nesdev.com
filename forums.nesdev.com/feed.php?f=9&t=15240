I originally assigned mapper 268 for the Coolboy mapper, meaning the additional registers are at $6000, then just emulated Mindkids under the same mapper number, just having the mapper emulation respond to both $5000 and $6000. I have since come across carts for which this does not work, hence, I intend to assign mapper 268 submapper 1 to Mindkids.<br /><br />One of these is a Chinese RPG (楚留香新传, Chǔliúxiāng xīn Zhuàn) running the Mindkids board in GNROM mode while using WRAM --- since the &quot;lock&quot; bit does not work in GNROM mode, WRAM writes to $6000 would inadvertently change the mapper configuration when responding at both $5000 and $6000.<br /><br />There are Chinese RPGs from Hengedianzi that use the original Coolboy board as an oversize TNROM board (i.e. using the full eight bits of MMC3 registers 6 and 7 for 2 MiB of PRG-ROM space) with WRAM, even though the ASIC registers sit at $6000, by carefully using the WRAM Enable and Lock bits. They boot in the last 8 KiB bank of the first 512 KiB block, like a regular MMC3 would, then switch to 2 MiB mode using the following sequence that must be run from RAM at $000-$7FF:<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">   LDA   #$00<br />   STA   $A001   ; Disable WRAM, so that writing to the Coolboy ASIC does not corrupt saved game<br />   LDA   #$00<br />   STA   $6000   ; clear outer bank offset and lower mask bits<br />   LDA   #$60<br />   STA   $6001   ; Enable PRG A19-A20<br />   LDA   #$80<br />   STA   $6003   ; Lock the Coolboy ASIC registers, so that WRAM writes do not change them<br />   LDA   #$80<br />   STA   $A001   ; Enable WRAM<br />   JMP   ($FFFC)   ; Execute RESET Handler in the last 8 KiB bank, now in 2 MiB address space</div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=133">NewRisingSun</a> — Thu Dec 06, 2018 11:45 am</p><hr />

So mapper 268 on the wiki mentions the MindKids board.  Mapper 268 appears to be specifically for Coolboy.  Is the MindKids board a submapper, or will it be assigned its own mapper?<br />I've dumped my NES Wisdom Tree Collection cart, and I hacked up a version of FCEUX that works with it, so now I want to know what mapper to use add to the header permanently.  It requires a Coolboy type mapper, but the registers are at 0x5000-0x5FFF (4 registers), not 0x6000-0x6FFF.  It has work RAM that it uses at 0x6000 for game patches.<br /><br />The Noah's Ark USA release is also a MindKids board, but it runs with the same mapper as the original MMC3.  The MindKids mapper is technically more accurate, but doesn't really matter for that one from a functional point of view.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8873">GreyRogue</a> — Fri Nov 30, 2018 9:22 pm</p><hr />

So it appears I should have kept my mouth shut until I got my copy of Quest Forge at least..  A month after my purchase I messaged piko asking when I can expect my copy.  Didn't get a reply, just a refund, and no reply to my follow up message inquiring about the refund.  So I guess I'm officially black listed from playing piko released games unless I buy second hand or pirate...  Looks like there's a limited edition up on ebay now I'll have to keep my eye on.  Appears piko sells QF through ebay as well, but I assume my purchase would get immediately refunded there as well.  I just want to play the game!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">BacteriaMage wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Thanks! I wasn't clear on your answer but my question was ambiguously stated.

The console generally supplies the cart with the same supply it's running off of.  If the cartridge has problems running at the lowered voltage it may not play, but that will result in a CPU crash or graphics glitching generally.  It's not going to cause any wear damage, it just may not run.<br /><br />The worst thing that could happen though is loosing your save, and/or draining the battery for battery backed SRAM cartridges.  If the console's supply voltage isn't high enough to beat out the ~3v of the coin cell in the cart the SRAM may be operating from the battery's power instead of the console.  That would drain the battery pretty quickly.  It can also result in corrupting the save even if the battery doesn't get drained.  I've seen this first hand with a battery powered FCmobileII clone of mine playing Zelda.  I played until the console batteries were dead a few times.  And when powering up the cart afterwards all my saves had been lost.  The battery still has enough charge to hold saves, but I learned my lesson on playing games which I care about the save files with such devices.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Tue Mar 13, 2018 2:35 pm</p><hr />
