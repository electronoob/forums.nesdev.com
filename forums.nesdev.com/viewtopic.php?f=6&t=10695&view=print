		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm looking for such for my game.<br /><br />I've already evaluated Famitone, but I think it isn't for me. One of downsides of famitone is that it doesn't correct pitch when played on PAL machines, so I'm looking into some library that would take care of that. I don't want to make music &quot;by hand&quot; as I don't exactly know notes and corresponding pitches and MML is way too hard for me. I'm good with trackers though (by the way, I'm running chiptune channel on YT, search for Chip M45t3r) and best NES tracker is Famitracker AFAIK.<br /><br />Yeah, I think I *could* use Famitracker's sound engine, but I've read there are some performance-related issues with it and whole thing isn't exactly documented, so... I just want easy to setup and use alternative.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In fact, FamiTone is there just because there was no public available sound engines with ability to use FamiTracker to create music and with sound effects support. Since then only <a href="http://kkfos.aspekt.fi/projects/nes/muse/" class="postlink">MUSE</a> appeared as an alternative, but it is tied to the <a href="http://kkfos.aspekt.fi/projects/nes/tools/musetracker/" class="postlink">Musetracker</a>.<br /><br />Adding a PAL pitch table into FamiTone is not a big deal at all. It is also not too difficult to make FamiTracker-to-custom format converter, using the now-built in text export functionality.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Except even your own converter couldn't convert it into Famitone's format (&quot;no patterns&quot; or similar error even though patterns were in file, as my <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=120867#p120867" class="postlink">listing</a> has shown).<br /><br />Anyway I have no problem with learning another tracker to do it if viable alternative is shown and MUSE seems to be such.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />FamiTone was successfully used in 8 released games, so there is a slight hope it could work. Especially if you use the provided text export plugin the way it is explained in the readme, rather than built-in text exporter, which has entirely different output format.
