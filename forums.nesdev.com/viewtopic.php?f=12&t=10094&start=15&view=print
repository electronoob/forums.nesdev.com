Why you think there were a talk about overclocking it a few years ago ? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />The most complex addon chips (such as GSU, S-DD1 and SA-1) have mechanisms bundled in them or have their memory mapped arbitrarily to prevent copiers and devices such as the PAR from working properly.

There was actually a game genie v2 in the works that would support RAM writes similar to the pro action replay for the SNES but it got scrapped due to their being warehouses still full of the old game genie's and interest in the SNES declining.<br /><br />Also, here's an interesting read about the game genie's roots:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://gamehacking.org/?s=qna&amp;id=40">http://gamehacking.org/?s=qna&amp;id=40</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I suppose it's time I could share these now, I have codemasters hardware documents of other game genie versions as well (gameboy, gameboy v2, sega genesis).  I have the old hardware documents for what was going to be the game genie II that never came to fruition.  I have no idea what software this was made with, I imagine it's something codemasters or whoever was in charge of development made themselves.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/joqkmzflaptm7yf/gg2.zip">https://www.dropbox.com/s/joqkmzflaptm7yf/gg2.zip</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Here's some pictures of its prototype:<br /><br /><a href="http://imgur.com/HWmFVD3.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HWmFVD3s.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><a href="http://imgur.com/sfXjSOg.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sfXjSOgs.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><a href="http://imgur.com/EU82MJb.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EU82MJbs.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><a href="http://imgur.com/A5093Kp.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/A5093Kps.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><a href="http://imgur.com/wYwYV5j.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wYwYV5js.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />That would be really awesome if someone actually did bring this thing to life.

That's the one that i've got.</div><br />Concerning the Pro ARP MK2, both of you are right ... kind of. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><br />To clarify, there are (at least) two versions of the MK2. Being an Action Replay fan, I have both. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />The &quot;first&quot; version has a black on-screen menu background. On power-up, it says &quot;v1.1.&quot; The following S/Ns are printed on the PCB:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">DATEL FAMICOM 3<br />REF 1027<br />09/93<br /><br />LZ95F45 DATEL ACTION REPLAY 9344 B &#91;CHIP&#93;</div><br />The &quot;second&quot; version has a blue menu background, and says &quot;v2.T&quot; on power-up. PCB S/Ns are:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">REF 1057<br />07/94<br />DATEL FAMI 4.1<br /><br />LZ95G72 DATEL TURBO REPLAY 9412 B &#91;CHIP&#93;</div><br />The interesting thing is that on the &quot;first&quot; version (menu v1.1, PCB REF 1027), only pin 1 (used e.g. by Starfox) is actually connected on the PCB, although from the outside, it looks like all the spare pins are there. On the &quot;second&quot; version (menu v2.T, PCB REF 1057) however, all the spare pins are indeed connected on the PCB.<br /><br />The result is that Starfox will work on both revisions, while e.g. the Super Gameboy (which passes through its audio using two more of the spare pins) will work correctly on the &quot;second&quot; version only (Gameboy games will play without sound on the &quot;first&quot; version).
