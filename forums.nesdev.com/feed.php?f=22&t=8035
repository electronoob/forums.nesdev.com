Hi. I'm the creator of this demo. Thanks for the interesting polarized conversation and analysis. The demo is exactly as intended: when my video player just wasn't ready for the Assembly party competitions, I decided to use it as is and found really interesting emergent glitches on the real hardware, so I explored different ways of fucking up the decompression routine. Emulators are unusable in this nature as they cannot reliably reproduce the incorrect PPU behaviour. Oh, and it's coded in C.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=865">visy</a> — Wed May 09, 2012 11:00 am</p><hr />

I don't see why this would be such a shock for people, since this sort of thing already has been done on the NES before (e.g. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCzzgjdH0JU" class="postlink">glitchNES</a>).<br />It's also been done <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hGVFFiRDJ0&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=29s" class="postlink">on the Megadrive</a>. And there are mods for the DMG/GBC that allow you to achieve various glitch effects.<br /><br />Some people like this sort of stuff. It's intentional. It's not always as simple as it might look to the viewer.<br />Move on.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1181">mic_</a> — Thu Aug 11, 2011 11:10 pm</p><hr />

koitsu:  Heheh, a while back I had already passed the point where I could look back on the stuff I did a long time ago and realize how crappy most of it was, my friend Andrew and I were talking about that too, we worked on a lot of tracked music and game designs together, including such NES masterpieces as Retard Adventure, Urban Acid Zombies, and Hot Seat Harry.  A lot of the music if it had an interesting part, was usually surrounded by all sorts of weird stuff - and lots of parts left in because it sounded funny.  But I made a genre called "industrial trash music", so things were mostly coming out as expected. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I've seen other demos visy has worked on (some great ones), so I realized (well, after trying to select NTSC/PAL) that it had to be glitchy intentionally.  I thought it was cool, I didn't like the jumping screen feature much, it'd be a challenge to get more annoying than that.<br /><br />For making a glitchy demo I think the NES can do some interesting stuff.  I'm still waiting to see someone do all their graphics entirely by enabling/disabling the monochrome bit, heheh.  AFAIK Final Fantasy (when getting an orb) is the only program that did something like that (essentially making an extra transparent layer of graphics).  But it would be nearly impossible to do that in a clean-looking way.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Aug 11, 2011 7:52 pm</p><hr />

Your reading compression level is apparently not currently at an adequate enough level to generate a proper reply <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> As Shiru pointed out, see the quotes around the word art. I'm not using it as my word, but in general/broad context. And I knew exactly what the demo was about and <em>I'm</em> the retarded one? Go figure. Also, I never said it was impressive or cool. If <em>that</em> part didn't apply to me, you should've put that in a separate paragraph or added some lines of space to differentiate it to the reply of my post. Thanks for trying, though <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br /><br /> As for demos, I think <em>most</em> demos (not in the context of a "game" demo) do fall under what most consider 'art'. They're more than just a boring representation of some effects (not that some aren't). The music/sounds, the theme, colors, style, etc. The whole presentation. Whether it appeals to someone's tastes or not, is irrelevant. You can draw a personal line as to what you think is art, but that is just personal preference of skill in presentation (being it painting or drawing or whatever). Or rather, the artists skills. Poor or lacking skills doesn't mean a work of expression <em>isn'</em>t art. It just means that it's probably below your standards of enjoyment/reception/Ican'tthinkoftherightfuckingword,meh.   <br /><br /><br />  What's the whole point in finding out what the code does? Or whether it's up to snuff or not? I mean, unless you're still hooked on the whole "I'm not so sure the glitches are really intentional". The probability that the code did glitch due to bad coding *and* the programmer played it off on the spot like it was support to be that way, is pretty damn low IMO. Especially since this is a known genre/area of demo making (I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't originally inspired by the "bending" scene. The style, I mean. Then again, I remember making such demos as a kid in BASIC, in the 80's. I wasn't the only one either). There's a much higher probability that he/she/they either accidentally glitched it at some point and decided to stick with that, or they purposely glitched it in specific ways until they were happy with the end result. Both come to the same result; the persons or group entered it into the compo knowing full well what the output and presentation should look like.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3645">tomaitheous</a> — Thu Aug 11, 2011 2:31 pm</p><hr />

First off, let's try to keep it respectful.<br /><br />Second, I'll say this is impressive to me. Not from an NES / 6502 coding standpoint, but from a creative standpoint. It is sort of like authoring a Milkdrop visualization. You just keep adding random stuff until you get something interesting out of the randomization. That said I think you can accomplish the same thing by using a random ROM corrupter on the SMB1 ROM. There's no real coding skill <em>displayed</em> here other than the first few lessons of the Nerdy Nights tutorials.<br /><br />Now, with all of that said, I agree with Koitsu. You'd have to be stoned to think this was cool. Believe me, <em>I know</em>.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3706">qbradq</a> — Thu Aug 11, 2011 11:17 am</p><hr />

I guess if this demo was designed to only LOOK like it was writing past the end of vblank, it would be something else.<br />It could throw some fake stray writes on the screen, then suddenly they would persist instead of going away, and form patterns or designs.
