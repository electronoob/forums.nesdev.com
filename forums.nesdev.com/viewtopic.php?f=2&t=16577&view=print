		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm looking for a mapper configuration that has a 32kB PRG-ROM and a 8kB CHR-RAM chip. I'd like to experiment with compressing graphics into the PRG-ROM or have an algorithm that renders them and then render those into the CHR-RAM during gameplay or during loading of the game. You might be asking why, but in my game idea, there's a part where the player can draw their character and when a player wins or loses, a sprite tile with two 4x6-font digits appears which tells the score and the same tile for lives.<br /><br />Does such a mapper exist?<br /><br />Also, if it's rare, what would you recommend that I should rather use which contains CHR-RAM?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />UNROM with a line or two at startup to set the low bank would also work.<br /><br /><br />Bootgod's database lets you search by mapper, if you want to speculate about rarity:<br /><a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?ines=34" class="postlink">http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?ines=34</a><br /><br />BUT you're not even trying to build BNROM here, you're building NROM + CHR-RAM. If you're looking for a donor just use a common NROM cart. BNROM is merely an iNES mapper that's compatible with what you want.<br /><br />It's extremely easy to build on new boards though, a donor shouldn't really be necessary.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Converting UNROM would also be pretty easy, involving rewiring only PRG A14. (Assuming you are using only a 28-pin 32 KiB 'PROM and thus that pin 1 is no function)<br /><br />I would even go so far to say that it would be trivial to do so at the same time if you add a socket (since CPU A14 is easily accessible on the 74'32)

This lets you reserve, say, the first four 4 KiB sectors for storage of drawings. A sector must be erased (set to $FF) all at once, and each sector can be erased only a few thousand times, though each erased byte can be rewritten to a non-$FF value individually. So you'll usually want to append new versions of a file through something like a log-structured file system. Memblers told me that nowadays, self-flashability is expected to be cheaper than adding a battery backup circuit.

Should I use MMC3 or MMC5? I just need 4kB of save memory, 4kB of CHR-RAM (not including the drawings in the save memory. If they're separate, then I need 8kB of CHR-RAM) and 32kB of PRG-ROM.<br /><br />If it seems to be better to use CHR-RAM in combination with CHR-ROM, then 4kB of CHR-ROM would be enough alongside of 4kB of CHR-RAM for all the drawings. And in that case, I'd like to be able to switch banks so that I have half of each in the sprite part and in the background part. Also, in that case I'd like to have a separate save chip with 4kB of memory.
