Can anybody find any differences in behavior between that document and what we know about the Famicom or NES?
<br />
<br />I've already found one: the description of "Sprite 0 Hit Flag" ($2002.d6) fails to mention that it doesn't become set if the overlap happens either at x=255 or at x=0..7 (if either or both of the clipping bits of $2001 are 0).
<br />
<br />The description of MMC3 IRQs in "Cartridge IRQ Counters" might be wrong.

<br />
<br />In the document it mentions 512 cycles, no room for setting the address.

<br />Another one:

<br />
<br />nesdev should host a database of stress test ROMs.  It is typically considered a good software development practice to have a collection of regression test data/programs that you can run your piece of software against to test for common or known issues.  There are a few stress test ROMs in the GoodNES collection, but I think there are a few that have been left out.  I am sure that some stress testers haven't even been tested on a real NES, which is a problem, but even then, any emul author could pop a stress test ROM in their NES, if they have a Squeedo or EPROM programmer and dev cart.

<br />Who could afford to put together a dev cart for each of 255 iNES board class numbers (even collapsing NROM and CNROM into one class)?

<br />
<br />CHR/NAM viewer does not promote accuracy. This new emu brings information that SUPPOSELY is inaccurate, or does not match what we know about the NES/Famicom. I did a comparision with NESticle because of this. Plus, if you still love NESticle, you're evil. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
