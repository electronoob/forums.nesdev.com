<br />I'd rather have BootGod's database, as it contains much more useful information. If the game is listed in BootGod's database, you can make a repo with an iNES file in every case that I know of (This includes games like Action 52).
<br />
<br />From looking at this thread again, what I see is missing is not a new format, but rather tools that can work with the information already there. ZapFC doesn't offer anything that isn't already there (iNES + BootGod's database).

<br />
<br />3gen, and others, one point that the ZapFC pro crowd has been stating all along is that emulators are not going to DROP support for iNES files.  As a home-brew creator, I'll probably never create a game that needs some whack-ass mapper.  As a developer I will ensure that my game uses a standard mapper, like NROM (no mapper at all), MMC1 or MMC3.  My game's iNES headers will be 100% correct.  There is no need to place homebrew into the ZapFC database.  Maybe once the game is no longer being actively developed and has shipped its "final" version, then fine.
<br />
<br />I have yet to hear of an emulator that plans to adopt ZapFC and abandon iNES.  I would be suprised if an established** emulator did this.
<br />
<br />**- for an arbitrary definition of "established".  I guess that means being listed on Zophar's domain in the EMU list, and being capable of properly emulating the majority of non-whack-ass-mapper/board games.

<br />I would gladly accept (and maybe buy) "dead" NES carts, if you don't want to fix them.  All there is to do is clean the connector and/or change the battery.  Unless you're zapping it with thousands of volts of electricity or seeing corrosion, a typical NES and SNES cart will surely outlive all of us here if stored properly (and without a battery).

<br />
<br />Pasofami format (delete/ignore the .PRM file), if split PRG/CHR is what's wanted.  ucon64 supports it, IIRC the command is "ucon64 -s -paso gamename.nes".  I had made a batch file that would split a UNROM iNES file, so I could automatically assemble it to work on my UNROM dev cart (uploaded with a ROM emulator).  A similar batch file could convert all of one's iNES files into a split format.  But why someone would want to store multiple copies of their ROMs in different formats, I don't know.

<br />
<br />given how many users store multiple bad dumps of games just because they do not even know what a [b1] flag is for, I don't think it is really a problem of storing multiple copies.
<br />
<br />I think users will simply get the files which are supported by emus and easily available. so far only iNES has been both supported and easy to find, and therefore there has been no real choice. 
<br />
<br />some MESS users are helping to make split prg/chr (call it MESS format or pasofami, I don't care) a bit easier to find than it currently is, but as long as no other emu supports them, it's a bit difficult that anyone would choose it over iNES
