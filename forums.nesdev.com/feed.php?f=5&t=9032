Thank you for this information. About court decision, yes if it changes you should put it back up (perhaps before that happens, change the text on the webpage so that it says "not currently available"). When I wrote about the different countries, I did not mean you personally, I meant in general. Such as, I live in Canada, and other people in here may live in various places.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4734">zzo38</a> — Sun Jun 24, 2012 8:42 pm</p><hr />

Its lawyers contacted the government office to request a copy of the Nintendo lock-out program, claiming that the company needed it for potential litigation against Nintendo. Once obtained, it used the program to create its own chip that would unlock the NES. When Tengen launched the unlicensed versions of its games, Nintendo immediately sued Tengen for copyright and patent infringement. In the initial phases of trial, the court sided with Nintendo, but the sides settled before the matter was fully resolved.<br /></div><br /><br />They did something rather nasty, stole the lockout chip's code straight from the Copyright office.

I thought it ruled in their favor. Or is this a different lawsuit that happened later? Either way, the lockout chip was patented, which is a different beast from reverse engineering something that just has a copyright stuck to it. I'm not actually sure why I brought that up, because this is the whole point of a patent (as in, RE'd or not, you can't publish something that someone else patented, you'd need to change it enough to step around the patent). If Tetris was a <em>patented</em> concept, then The Tetris Co would have grounds to take down clones.

The only thing I can see that would be subject to any kind of law-related action is the infringement on the "Tetris" trademark. Even then, you're only infringing if you use the word Tetris.<br /><br />Is the concept of a game where you maneuver 4 solid objects arranged in a continuous shape, with the shape randomized in some fashion, with the intention of forming complete rows to delete them patented? If not, anyone is free to clone the game however they see fit, as long as "Tetris" doesn't appear anywhere within.<br /><br />Were the makers of Crazy Kong, Brush Roller, and Great Giana Sisters sued for the (sometimes blatant) similarities between DK, Pacman, and Super Mario Bros?<br /><br />Finally, Tengen got away with reverse engineering the lockout chip, didn't they? If someone reverse engineered a video game to produce a faithful clone, is it theft?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Thu Jun 21, 2012 8:22 pm</p><hr />
