I mean, even if you got only 32KB to be mapped correctly, the best you could do with that is display a message explaining that the emulator can't run the game, but the game will still not run, since it's incomplete. IMO, displaying a message (whih would be pretty much useless once the format is supported by current emulators) is not worth making the specification more complex.

Take a fairly big game like Ninja Gaiden. The whole main program and game engine exist in less than 16K. Simple bankswitching for data and the music and cinema engines gets the job done. Why exactly do you need almost 48K of linear PRG space? Unless you can implement it in hardware as simply as UxROM I hardly see the point. 
<br />
<br />I think there is a reason why UxROM is popular. It gives you plenty of space for data, code, and graphics and its operation and implementation is so simple. There is a laundry list of great games that use it, so it's no wonder it has been enough for homebrew efforts.

<br /><div class="quotetitle">On IRC today, Kev and I wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">&lt;kevtris&gt; well if it was me, I'd just directly map 4000-FFFF in the file and not dick around with worrying about cutting out pieces of it<br />&lt;tepples&gt; So as I understand it, you say the ROM would have PRG size 3: first $4000-$7FFF, then $8000-$BFFF, then $C000-$FFFF. But the way it'd have to be burned to an actual 27C512 would be $8000, then $C000, then blank, then $4000<br />&lt;kevtris&gt; yeah sounds about right. it's probably best to linearly map it in the file, then adjust to burn an eprom. you have to process the file somehow anyways (stripping headers, etc)<br />&lt;tepples&gt; True, but the objection is that the existing tools for processing the file don't include reordering. That said, tokumaru agrees with you.<br />&lt;kevtris&gt; so... write a new one. it's going to be a hack one way or another</div>
<br />This means that for mappers 0 (NROM), 3 (CNROM), 13 (CPROM), and 99 (Vs. Unisystem), if PRG size is 3 banks, the ROM image is arranged as follows:

<br />
<br />To be clear though it really doesn't matter how it's burned on the EPROM.  That could vary and be used for optimizations of the mapper and PCB etc.  So I guess in reality regardless of the situation the burner of EPROMs and designer of PCB/mapper really needs to know what they are doing anyways.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Did we reach a conclusion on the name?

<br />I just ask because earlier you stated it would help for programming in C and then later said that bankswitching is not impairing your ability to use C. When you create a UNROM board with just two 74 series chips I don't see the advantage of getting less PRG-ROM which perhaps more logic chips to decode it?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />lidnariq can you modify your test per the newly defined format?  Your PRG is 64KB and I don't know how I should cut it down to 3 banks.  I think I see the order you chose based on where the reset vectors appear to be, but I'm still left with an extra bank.  Or is the test meant to be ran as 4 banks to ensure that the first bank doesn't get enabled and conflict with other devices at that address?
<br />
<br />EDIT: I've been running all four banks although I'm assuming the first bank is useless other than filler (was actually the third bank in your .prg)
<br />
<br />I got it running but for some reason I'm having an issue with what appears to be $5000-57FF.  For the first line I'm getting HZ for the first quarter, checks for the second qtr, X's for the third qtr, and checks for last/fouth qtr.
<br />
<br />All other lines are checks.  I've never used PRG A12 as an input and that line being high is the only thing that tells my logic to enable the PRG ROM for $5000-57FF.  I'll have to do some more debugging...  I also sort of confirmed the ROM was good by enabling the PRG ROM above $4000.  I got M's for the first qtr which is where PRG ROM should be disabled everything else is checks.  So all signs point to an issue with PRG A12 for some reason.

<br />
<br />Well that makes more sense to me now, you're trying to do this to help get people without low level (6502 asm) knowledge involved by getting extra space for some sort of C programming development setup?
<br />
<br />Kind of reminds me of that NBASIC or whatever it was called. There was a demo made with it called Sack of Flour Heart of Gold I think.

<br />Ok, someone will answer "because with some shematic [....] it will ignore the first 2048 bytes". Ok, ok, but that doesn't mean all super-NROM carts would use this schematic. I'm pretty sure it's possible to decode the ROM at $4018-$ffff with a single PAL/GAL chip easily - and those aren't more expensive than 74xxx chips.
