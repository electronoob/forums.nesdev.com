I heard it's not very hard to build one, but when it comes to UV light, I don't think that's something I want to muck around with.  
<br />
<br />I once looked into alternate sources for UV, like the sun, but they say it can take upwards to a week or more for that to do it, if even then.  And fluorescent light can take ages longer.  So it looks like I'm stuck with eeproms as well.  Finding a place that doesn't stick you on shipping is the key.  I just browse Ebay till something interesting pops up.

<br />
<br />Umm, the sort of ultraviolet required to erase EPROMs can severely damage your eyes and skin (severe sunburn, instant cataracts) - not exactly the sort of stuff you want to mess around with.

<br />- save the output as a .BIN files and flash the BIOSrom with a tool like AWDflash and get that in a nescart?

<br />The only possible problems I can think of off the top of my head in regards to using the program there to do it is like a CRC check it might do to make sure you don't mess up your bios.

<br />Arrrgh! Yet another failure to think thoroughly enough before posting! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />
<br />
<br />*regains sanity* I really have to learn that negligible != 0; (I also need to be more careful about when I judge something to be negligible.) The problem was that I had that Ionic Breeze thing stuck really deep in my head, and I know that in such a device (specifically, the Ionic Breeze GP Professional Series model), the electrostatic precipitation creates far more ozone than the UV bulb. I've never done serious electronics hacking, so maybe I should stay out of this discussion.

<br /><div class="quotetitle">85cocoa wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What chemicals are present in solder fumes?</div>
<br />
<br />Specifically it's not the solder, but the fumes from the burning flux.  Usually solder has rosin flux in it (made from pine tree sap).  I also use water-soluable flux, which has a seemingly noxious chemical smell even when it's not burning.

<br />That's no problem if it's a one-time shot.
<br />if I can just flash em I should do fine.

<br />There are 2 other significant differences I ran across:
<br />1. All of the spring-boards are red, even the super-strong ones - the latter are supposed to be <strong>green</strong>.
<br />2. All of the piranha plants are green and don't come out of the pipes when you're next to them. Somewhere around world 4, they're supposed to turn <strong>red</strong> and ignore your position when coming out (unless you're standing directly on top of the pipe, I think).

<br />
<br />Oh boy. Well, I've have the chance to brick a computer (specifically the one im on right now amongst others <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ), but this isn't too difficult.
<br />
<br />First, get the target computer, rip the holo. sticker off the top of the BIOS (or the firmware revision if not somthing spiffy).
<br />
<br />Check that number that it has.
<br />
<br />common for penium 1/mmx boards is the x010 series chips, providing 128KB (1Mbit) of EEPROM. Somtimes an x020 is used, and that'd obviously provide double.
<br />
<br />If the BIOS has a window, you're SOL (27x512 and 27x256 generally are windowed and only found on 386/486 board anyways).
<br />
<br />Prep a floppy for flashing.
<br />
<br />Win9x boot disk (you had one to make sure the mobo worked in the first place, right?)
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.uniflash.org/" class="postlink">uniflash software</a> -- CHECK SUPPORTED HARDWARE/CHIPS SECTION PLEASE ---
<br />
<br />Also consult your mobo manual to check if a write-protect dip is enabled or a congruent arrangement (like a 5v/12v toggle) is present. I've seen both (and both on the same board)
<br />
<br />You'd in this case take your code and mirror across the entire chip (dos command copy /b rom.bin+rom.bin+rom.bin+rom.bin flash.bin) &lt;--Assuming 64KB (256Kbit) code size on a 256KB (1Mbit) chip.
<br />
<br />Also, if you do this, salvage your flash chips from <em>other</em> devices...It's absolutely stupid to brick a Pentium computer for the sole purpose of utilizing it's EEPROM.
<br />
<br />copy uniflash files and "flash.bin" to the boot floppy. Boot it.
<br />
<br />Uniflash is pretty straighforward, and has saved my ass several times, so I'm not really going to go into detail.
<br />
<br />&lt;/turtorial&gt;&lt;/novel&gt;
