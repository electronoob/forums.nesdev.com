I've run into a bit of a snag with a particular Steam-released game called SteamWorld Dig.  <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/252410/discussions/1/666828127002122101/" class="postlink">Many players found their joypads didn't work at all, and are being told to use nonsense like JoyToKey</a>.<br /><br />The game itself has a file called gamepads.cfg that you can edit and actually add your own joypad definition, which the game will hnour.  The file format wasn't documented, but <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/252410/discussions/1/666828127002122101/#c666828126945060301" class="postlink">the default file looked familiar to me</a>:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"># Retro NES gamepad (just for fun/example; doesn't actually have the required number of buttons)<br />79001100000000000000504944564944,USB Gamepad,a:b1,b:b2,leftx:a0,lefty:a4</div><br />After much prodding, I finally got the developers <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/252410/discussions/1/666828127002241783/#c648814395925112892" class="postlink">to explain what the heck they're doing</a>: the first two fields are something SDL 2.0 itself refers to/comes up with/can compile/generate:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GameControllerAddMapping">http://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GameControllerAddMapping</a><!-- m --><br /><br />...based on Windows USB device strings and so on.  I can tell the last hex values in the first field end in &quot;HIDVID&quot; but the rest is a bunch of SDL 2.0 API-generated abstract gobbledegook.  I've dug through the Device Manager and I can work out small bits/pieces but nothing really adds up that would match exactly what SDL 2.0 expects.<br /><br />I was wondering if there was someone here who could write me a simple Win32 application using SDL 2.0 that basically would dump all of those strings and capabilities of every joypad found:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.libsdl.org/CategoryGameController#Enumerations">http://wiki.libsdl.org/CategoryGameCont ... umerations</a><!-- m --><br /><br />...to stdout, so that I could add a proper entry into gamepads.cfg and get my USB gamepad working with the game (it's a Playstation 2-to-USB adapter but it's pure USB HID, no drivers).<br /><br />Or if someone here has familiarity with the SDL 2.0 code -- no I am not going to reverse-engineer it and spend days looking at github source or whatever else -- that can tell me how these strings are generated on Windows (i.e. how to create the string myself), that would absolutely awesome.  All I have available to me are the standard tools that come with Windows XP SP3.<br /><br />I just have little faith that the developers are really going to do anything about the issue, since they're already advocating Joy2Key (and if you think this is a solution, trust me, it isn't; try running something in windowed mode with Joy2Key using the profile for the game, then switching to a browser window and accidentally doing something like bumping a button on your joypad... yeah...).<br /><br />Thanks guys.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />SDL 1 and SDL 2 are pretty different in this regard, so I would not be surprised if SDL 1 didn't offer or do the same thing.  One would really have to look at the SDL source to know.<br /><br />Okay, so there's a Python program that does some magic.  Great -- now either I have to find someone who can compile me an .exe of that Python program (yes it's possible to do this, trust me), or I have to install Python for Windows and risk making a mess of my system.  I have a friend who compiles Python stuff like this (his workplace demands compiled Python apps on Windows because, and I quote, &quot;installing Python on Windows is painful and makes a mess&quot;), so I'll ask him if maybe he can do that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Perhaps the GUID thing is new in SDL2. There is a separate project called PySDL2, which appears to be the successor to Pygame. If I wanted to take a guess, I'd guess that the GUID is somehow formed from the VID and PID, which you might be able to find in Device Manager. The example might be VID 0x0011 and PID 0x0079 or vice versa.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In Windows, it looks like the GUID comes directly from directx; SDL doesn't synthesize it.<br /><br />I also checked the Linux code, and SDL creates a GUID starting with the bus type and then either some string literal that comes from the joystick's path, or it's created with the (16-bit) vendor code, the product code, and the version code each followed by 16 bits of 0. I'm not going to pretend I know how Linux works, so I have no idea what any of this is.<br /><br />Joystick support in PCs is such a pain in the ass due to a lack of any kind of standardization (until recently), that it feels like it's not worth the effort to do anything other than keyboard/mouse and wrap your joystick with utilities like joy2key (despite protests <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ). At least it'd always work!

But I've been <a href="https://pineight.com/mw/?title=USB_game_controller" class="postlink">thinking through this problem</a>. The autodetection that I implemented for PyFHBG is based on the name of the joystick, with no GUID stuff because SDL 1 (and hence Pygame) doesn't expose the name. Here are some tips:<br /><br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Make configuring an unknown brand of joystick idiot-proof. </li><li>Allow saving and loading controller configuration in a text file, so that configs can be copied and pasted on forums and in e-mail. </li><li>Include reasonable defaults for keyboard, Xbox 360 controllers, and the most popular HID controllers.
