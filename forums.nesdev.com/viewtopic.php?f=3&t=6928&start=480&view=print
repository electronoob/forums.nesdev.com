Is there suppose to be a special icon of any sort like when aiming with the mouse? Like a target or something? When I play light gun games I just see my normal mouse arrow over the game play. It works fine but it is kind of awkward aiming with a white arrow. Also, is there any plans to add a fast forward button? I love being about to hold the L bumper button on my Xbox gamepads to speed up unskippable intro and cut screens I have no interest in. This is a great emulator, looking forward to the next release.

Let me give you an example of this.<br />The Nintendo World Championship 1990 Cartridge/ROM.<br /><br />In real life this was a competition cartridge with three special made mini games made of Super Mario Bros./Rad Racer/Tetris and the timer was set on 6 minutes and 21 seconds and the mission was to collect 50 coins in Super Mario Bros., race to the finish in Rad Racer and get the high score in Tetris.<br /><br />I've seen in Nestopia you can change the time and if to show timer using Dipswitches.<br /><br />In puNES, I think it's set to default values of 6 minutes and 15,5 seconds, the closest it can get to 6:21 and also it's not showing the timer of how much time it's left.<br /><br />Can this be done in puNES?

Someone over at the bliss-box forum modified Nintendulaotr and Nestopia to make these buttons mappable and added the required hit/miss routine and made it work (CRT of course still required): <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://blissbox.freeforums.org/blissbox-d-i-y-help-with-some-controllers-t208-30.html">http://blissbox.freeforums.org/blissbox ... 08-30.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I'll be trying this out for myself as soon as my bliss-box adapter arrives, hopefully next week, but it would be great if I would be able to use puNES for emulation!

Coincidentally I just received the adapter, but now the modified emulators are giving me troubles (by not working under WinXP, which I am stuck with for the moment). Hopefully the developer will be able to help (or puNES will add support  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> ) or I will need to get something with W7x64 that hooks up to a TV...
