<br />
<br />Slightly off topic, but I am still curious: This being the case and after other statements made in this thread, why do you have such a problem with Sivak? He posts here about nesdev. He develops for NES, and makes legitimate games. He also happens to sell them. 
<br />
<br />I'm going to be in that boat soon. I'm making a game that I will most likely sell through some means. After that point will you make a personal promise to not help me as well? (If I ever ask a question, I haven't really done much of that.)

<br />I imagine that Bregalad doesn't have bills to pay yet, he probably still lives with his family and his primary occupation is studying. I say give him a couple of years and he will probably see things differently then.
<br />
<br />That's what happened to me at least... back when I had no obligations I used to say that my personal projects were just for fun and I would never make money from them, but now I'm in a position that in order to justify the time I want to spend on my personal projects I'll have to sell them, because I won't be using that time to work on something else to bring money home.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I totally understand the frustration, I feel it too.  What I had considered doing before (but decided against it, for now) was to make a section of the forum that's dedicated to cart/system modifications.  I guess it'd be like the newbie forum, but more specialized.
<br />
<br />Reasons I decided against it include:
<br /><ul><li>it's stuff could be addressed with a FAQ/wiki and a single thread for questions / related issues outside the scope of the original queston</li><li>concern about spreading things too thin</li><li>typically there's only way to wire it.  it works, or it doesn't.  it's boring!</li></ul>
<br />Of course if any random person wants to post about their nifty idea to modify a cart or NES, hopefully they'd feel free to do so anyways (and likely would skip over any rules if there were any).  I wouldn't expect it to to be something creative, but one can hope.  A discussion at Nintendoage about adding LEDs into an NES cart was kinda interesting.  Led me to think of a way an array of LEDs could glow at different brightnesses depending on how long the NES had a particular bank switched in during a frame.  Just a trick, but maybe useful for debugging/testing.
<br />
<br />But to the original topic, I've just been dead-set against having any kind of rules at all and have wanted to keep it that way as much as possible.  I'd enable anonymous posting like it was originally (IP address only), if not for it surely turning into spamfest-2010.  I'm sure every huge bureaucratic system started out with a good intention and one rule to enforce.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure where else a rule like this can lead other than requiring all sorts of detective work and grand inquisition as to why they're doing it.  It's too useful for developers to use it (though I think anyone wanting to using ASIC mappers and clones of such won't get the most "bang for their buck").
<br />
<br />Oh what I forgot to say in my other posts - There is at least one upside for NES developers of people buying reproductions.  That means people are using their NES's, and that they want to buy new carts for it.  And that's a pretty damn good upside, if you want to release a game.
<br />
<br />tepples: mentioning the PowerPak in a guideline wording or similar I think comes close to being an advertisement or endorsement (even though it is the only option in a lot of cases).  of course a full list of options for different situations would be better, but that's more work and maintenance (and maybe would be nice to have on the wiki, if it's not already).

<br />
<br />I disagree. The PowerPAK at $135 USD is not high in my opinion. While I would agree that this product is not cheap, good products seldom are cheap. If you consider the value of what the PowerPAK can do for you and weigh it against alternatives I think it is priced well. It would be far more expensive and less comfortable developing a game with nothing more than modified original cartridges to take EPROMs and some EPROM programmer. While you might start out cheaper your costs will eclipse the PowerPAK over time in cost of EPROMs and other boards. Plus the time consumed by reprogramming EPROMs versus overwriting a file on a CF card. 
<br />
<br />It would be nice if there was an alternative fairly capable development aimed product. But it would need to be significantly cheaper while still being reasonably capable. You might be able to sell a MMC1 USB Flash Cartridge if you could produce it cheap enough. But if you get too close to the cost of the PowerPAK then you may as well just buy one of them.

<br />
<br />I think that from seeing the final price estimate of the all-in-one NES with CF card thing that somebody else is working on, I would say that he's not making that much off each cart. Probably $25 or so, and I'm fine with that. I would think that such a thing would cost $100 to develop. I mean, look at the price of other flash carts. They're just as high. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />
<br />BOLD reply:I really think that testing on hardware is cool and all, but emulator is king. Making a cart with a debugger is not better then ones included in like FCEUDX. I love it. Not saying it would be nice to see it an option, I just view it as kind of useless as emulators in the end are probably the better option to debug code and run programs.

<br />Well, that depends... I've seen $5 soldering irons and $45 EPROM programmers... I wouldn't expect them to last long though (I had to buy a better EPROM programmer to replace my $45 one - it still works though, it's just picky about parallel ports).

For that kind of people I guess that the PowerPak is a nice thing to have.
<br />
<br />Even though I can test my software using a PowerPak or a development cartridge, I usually go with the PowerPak. My EPROM programmer is kept away (having it share the desk with my cats probably wouldn't end well), but my card reader is right here. I don't trust the PowerPak much when it comes to mappers though, so if I ever work on anything that uses more than a discrete logic mapper I'll surely double check a few times along the way.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />$130 is a great price for PowerPak, I think.  You're paying more for the variety of mapper support (which 95% of is practically useless to developers), and the convenience of using compact flash.
<br />
<br />Building a CopyNES and using the PPak Lite or something similar is another option.  But of course, that could be argued to be harder than modifying a cart.  And the USB CopyNES kit at $70, IIRC is maybe twice what kevtris sold the parallel port kit version for (parallel port can be a pain to deal with though).  CopyNES can be made to program flash carts.  So that's more convenient than an EPROM burner.
<br />
<br />An EPROM emulator is also a very good option, I spent around $200 on one a while back, and they can be bought for about the same price these days I think (with USB support, maybe battery backup).  For anyone that doesn' tknow, it's just a board with an SRAM (and a PC interface to it), and a standard IDC cable that plugs into an EPROM socket.  You just upload the memory from the PC, and it's live, no powering off the system needed.
<br />
<br />Many years ago I actually had thought about designing one (there's not much to it) and producing a ROM emulator.  But one annoyance is that you can't find DIP-32 IDC adapters anywhere (you can get 28-pin and 40-pin all day), so you have to cut down 40-pin ones.  That, and the fact that there are already lots of them around.
<br />
<br />And yeah, emulators on a PC can be used for testing and debugging, and that's just great for most of your game (like all the logic and 6502 stuff).  But when it comes to dealing with the PPU and doing timing tricks, I can only be shocked and amazed when emulators get it looking the same as an NES.  You might be OK if you stick to things that Battletoads does, or other cases that actually get tested, but other than that it's always seemed surprisingly easy to get stuff on an NES screen that looks different on emulators (often with differences between every emulators).  Until even recently, if you had written a game like NESnake 2 that uses DPCM and reads the controllers, you would have been totally screwed when you tried to play it on an NES.  I'm sure there are still other "gotchas" remaining to be found somewhere.

<br />This is great, the only real disadvantage is that one of these is not enough for an NES game that has PRG-ROM and CHR-ROM, so you'll either have to buy another device (another EPROM emulator or an EPROM programmer) or stick to CHR-RAM.

But yeah CHR-RAM is pretty easy, I made a bootloader that loaded 8kB CHR, but one could add larger CHR and use the bankswitching to the same effect.  Won't be as fast to load since there's an extra couple steps in there, though.
<br />
<br />The CHR bus is pretty much free from worries with bus conflicts, mapper conflicts, and all that.  I've been curious how CHR-Flashrom writing would work (or if it would), I haven't bothered to try it.
