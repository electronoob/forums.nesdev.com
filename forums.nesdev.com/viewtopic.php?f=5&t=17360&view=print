	</div><br />I tried to close the screen, but instead the two plastic pieces around the screen snapped apart because the screen was going down, but the hinge wasn't. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /> Where the hinge connects to the frame that surrounds the screen was apparently just thin aluminum, (top left of the image) which is really stupid because the hinges actually take a fair amount of force to close. Of course, it's past the warranty I already voided by opening it up to change the hard drive...<br /><br />I figured I'd hook it up to my TV before I do anything else, but for whatever reason, it cuts off the edges. (Like, almost the entire Start bar.) It's not the TV either; I can zoom out on the TV but then it just displays black borders. I opened up AMD Radeon settings and it has an option to change the screen size, but upon changing it at all, everything gets jerkier; I guess it's rendering it at full resolution and then scalling it, but I don't think a $550 quad core computer should have an issue with that...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A lot of TVs assume that anything coming in on HDMI is formatted to assume overscan. Because the first HDTVs were 1080i CRTs, consumer electronics HDTV signals are formatted for nominal CRT overscan. LCD HDTVs have to enlarge the image by a few percent in order to compensate for this. Check your TV's menu for a &quot;1:1&quot; or &quot;game&quot; mode.

The problem is how I do this, and it's just such a shit design that I worry it would break again. The plastic casing of the computer is really falling apart a bit; all of the ports have cracked plastic above them (because the plastic is so thin) and half of the stupid plastic tabs that partially connected the top and bottom half of the base of the laptop broke off just from opening the thing. I don't even know why they were there in the first place, because the thing already has like 12 screws holding it together.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">3gengames wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Force the screen size in your display settings if you're under Windows.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hinges have been a main point of failure for most of the laptops I've owned.<br /><br />On one where I had the hinge seize up like that, I ended up just removing it and let the laptop live out the rest of its life with only one working hinge. Was a bit floppier after that. At other times I've sent a laptop back for repair (various amounts of success, might be without the machine for a while and they might only do very minimal repair without addressing the root cause), but most of the time I'll just do something hacky to it myself so I don't have to wait, but I tend to treat mine very roughly as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What OS are you using? If it is Windows, AFAIK it has some wonky drivers for generic HDTVs (probably applies to other OSes also).<br /><br />A few months ago, my 17&quot; CRT monitor finally broke and having no replacement on hand I took out an old 32&quot; HDTV from the bedroom (which for some reasons wasn't in used for a few years) and connected my box to it via HDMI<br /><br />Initially Win10 was only able to use 1366 x 720 (or something like that), claiming it's the TV's native resolution and in actuality the result was a blurry mess, as the panel was full HD. Messing around with settings, of drivers, Nvidia's control panel, and rebooting several times, I still didn't get it to work, and occasionally I could force the mode to 1920 x 1080 but the screen went blank. Eventually after some struggles (I really didn't know what happened and what I had really done) the TV started to show something in full HD resolution, but the screen was off-centre and a bit stretched so some of the stuff were off-screen (probably the TV by default hiding some &quot;overscanned edges). After more struggles I found that in the TV that was a display option called &quot;full-scan&quot; (available from the switches between 16:9 and 4:3, etc. options in my model) and turning it on finally made the full HD screen shown pixel to pixel and I don't have any other problems since.<br /><br />I then checked, the generic HDTV driver used by WIN10 was last updated in <strong>2006</strong>(!), so they shipped a new product with a driver 10 years old, and you may need to jump through hoops to make it fully work, and that IMO <em>generic</em> HDTVs are still a recent thing, so why wouldn't they care about them?<br /><br />So, my advice is, keep trying, and probably everything will work in the end, without anyone figuring out why, but at least, it will work.
