		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not experienced with transistors, I'm getting into them so I can use one as a single NOT inverter, because I am incorporating a chip on the cartridge, a CMOS chip that uses an Active High Reset signal. Since SNES is active low RESET, I want to invert the Reset signal to the Reset pin of my new chip.<br /><br />I'm very inexperienced with all the different types of Currents, and the addition of transistors. I can understand the flow now after learning about them, I just don't understand the relationship between current at the BASE and current at the Collector, depending on when the BASE is on/off. Or what resistors I should best choose, keeping note I am using a CMOS chip. Here is a general picture of the schematic for my NOT inverter.<br /><br />Note: The input signal is only connected to the BASE, not the emitter (as it can be mistakenly interpreted). The emitter is only connected to GND, tested it myself, this circuit with an LED. All I can really say is that the LED gets less juice than the other LEDs, because I use a considerably lower resistance to VCC for this LED, and it outputs just about the same light as the other 'normal' in-circuit LEDS with higher resistances to VCC. I know that also matters that those other LEDs currents are coming from IC pins, so it matters what current those pins are sending out. <br /><br />I'm just trying to figure out how current works in the circuit, in general, and in specific to this transistor so I can know how to treat it with regard to the CMOS IC I will be incorporating. However, it would be nice to know in general if current matters at all to a logic pin whose logic level relies on voltage.<br /><br />Alright I'm out

I have more to say: <br /><br />You say &quot;as much as it asks for.&quot; I also thought this way, that a component would only suck up as much current as necessary. However, then why do transistor circuits as I am learning call for a resistor before the Base pin?? Why doesn't that base pin only use as much as it needs? They say without the resistor you frisk frying the component. I don't understand, since all the IC components I learned about I learned as only using what they need, no risk of fry. Why is this transistor different? What other components are like this? Can you explain it?
