		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I seem to get drastically different results using either the performance counter approach or the timeGetTime approach.  On my laptop my emulator runs like a rabbit no matter which timing approach.  On my desktop it crawls like a turtle.
<br />
<br />My desktop is Intel P4 3GHz hyperthreaded, 1GB DDR RAM.
<br />
<br />My laptop is Intel Core2 Duo, 2GB RAM.
<br />
<br />I'm also curious if differences in the VisualStudio environment could have anything to do with it.  The one on my laptop is probably more 'up to date' because it is a work laptop.  The one on my desktop always seems a bit slow...but I have no idea what could be different.  Perhaps I'll have to convince work that I use my desktop for work also.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /> 
<br />
<br />Also, I remember a discussion on here regarding pops and clicks in the audio stream...but I can't find it.  I remember there was lots of discussion on how to avoid/fix this.

<br />
<br />If it's just a framerate limiter and it makes your emulator lag then it sounds like something is very wrong either with that code or with the computer.
<br />
<br />The way I do it is just like this, which has worked for me on every computer I've tried it on:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;if &#40;limitFps&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;QueryPerformanceCounter&#40;&amp;perfCnt2&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;while &#40;&#40;&#40;perfCnt2.QuadPart-perfCnt1.QuadPart&#41;&lt;&lt;16&#41;/perfFreq.QuadPart &lt; frameInterval&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#123; QueryPerformanceCounter&#40;&amp;perfCnt2&#41;; &#125;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;perfCnt1 = perfCnt2;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&#125;</div>
<br />Where frameInterval = 65536/framerate.
<br />
<br />Note that this isn't the best way to implement framerate limiting since the process/thread will use 100% CPU while looping. Ideally you should first determine how close you are to the next frame, and put a "broader" loop first which Sleep()s for a few milliseconds between each iteration.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I prefer crossplatform solutions whenver possible.  Both of those are Windows-specific.  Most crossplatform libs worth using offer some sort of "get tick" funciton.
<br />
<br />If sticking to just Windows, I always just used GetTickCount().  You really don't need more than millisecond granularity, IMO.
<br />
<br />I remember hearing that timing problems on laptops are common, though I never actually tested any of my programs on a laptop.
<br />
<br />From what what you're describing it just sounds like your framerate code is just messed up.  Here's generally what I do:
<br />
<br />The idea is, you keep a var which counts the passing milliseconds.  You multiply these milliseconds by the framerate (ie:  60 on NTSC, 50 on PAL -- yes I know it's not exactly 60 -- if you want to do 60.1 you can).  When that var reaches 1000, one frame's worth of time has passed, so you do a frame, and subtract 1000.  This also has a benefit of seeing how many frames behind you are.  IE if the counter is &gt;5000 you know you're 5 frames behind.
<br />
<br />Since CPU attention may vary due to sleep times, processor availability and other factors, you NEED wiggle room.  If you start skipping frames to catch up when you're only 2 frames behind, the display will get incredibly jerky because you'll end up skipping to catching up, then sleeping too long, then skipping to catch up, then sleeping too long, etc.
<br />
<br />Because of this, you want to give yourself a window where you say "don't catch up until I'm X frames behind).  You can make this an option in the emulator if you want the user to be able to configure it.  I find that 5 frames is pretty good.
<br />
<br />It basically works like this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">DWORD ms_passed;&nbsp; // number of milliseconds passed since last iteration<br />DWORD frametimer; // timer to count when to do the next frame<br />DWORD lasttime;&nbsp; &nbsp;// record of time of last iteration<br />DWORD FPS;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // 60 &#40;NTSC&#41; or 50 &#40;PAL&#41;<br /><br />while&#40;emulator_is_running&#41;<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; // process user input<br />&nbsp; PumpMessages_ProcessInput_etc_etc&#40;&#41;;<br /><br />&nbsp; // see how many milliseconds have passed since the last iteration<br />&nbsp; ms_passed = GetTickCount&#40;&#41; - lasttime;<br /><br />&nbsp; // update 'lasttime' tracker to mark current time<br />&nbsp; lasttime += ms_passed;<br /><br />&nbsp; // accumulate time difference in our frametimer<br />&nbsp; frametimer += ms_passed * FPS;<br /><br />&nbsp; // if frametimer is &lt; 1000, we're ahead of schedule<br />&nbsp; if&#40;frametimer &lt; 1000&#41;<br />&nbsp; &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Sleep&#40;1&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; continue;<br />&nbsp; &#125;<br /><br />&nbsp; // otherwise see if we're falling WAY behind<br />&nbsp; int frames_skipped = 0;<br />&nbsp; while&#40;frametimer &gt; 1000 * FRAME_SKIP_THRESHHOLD&#41;<br />&nbsp; &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; if&#40;frames_skipped &gt; MAX_FRAMES_TO_SKIP&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ResyncFrameTimer&#40;&#41;;&nbsp; &nbsp; // give up on trying to catch up, just resync<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; continue;&nbsp; // --- this continue is pseudo-code, the intent here is to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // jump back to the while&#40;emu_is_running&#41; outer loop,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; //&nbsp; not this inner loop.&nbsp; Whoops.&nbsp; You get the idea.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &#125;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; SkipAFrame&#40;&#41;;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// emulate a frame, but don't draw it<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; frametimer -= 1000;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ++frames_skipped;<br />&nbsp; &#125;<br /><br />&nbsp; // now that too-slow and too-fast conditions are covered<br />&nbsp; //&nbsp; just do a normal frame<br />&nbsp; DoAFrame&#40;&#41;;<br />&nbsp; frametimer -= 1000;<br />&#125;<br /><br />//----------------------------------------------<br />// The ResyncFrameTimer&#40;&#41; function should be called when the user has<br />//&nbsp; exited the emulation loop for a long peroid of time.&nbsp; Like if they<br />//&nbsp; entered a menu, or if a new ROM was loaded, etc.<br /><br />void ResyncFrameTimer&#40;&#41;<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; lasttime = GetTickCount&#40;&#41;;<br />&nbsp; frametimer = 0;<br />&#125;<br /></div><br /><br />Of course ideally you'd want to sync to sound.  That can be done the same way, but instead of:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">timer += ms_passed * FPS;<br />if&#40;timer &lt; 1000&#41;&nbsp; &#123;...&#125;<br /></div><br /><br />You do:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">timer += samples_passed * FPS;<br />if&#40;timer &lt; sample_rate&#41; &#123;...&#125;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />You can find the number of sampled passed by polling your audio's CanWrite style function.  Of course this doesn't work very well if audio is output in very large chunks (*cough*SDL*cough*allegro*cough*).  For those such cases, I made a wrapper for audio which uses a millisecond timer to "simulate" audio being played back at a smoother rate.
<br />
<br />But that's another topic.
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT -- made note about continue goof

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The problem with GetTickCount is that while it returns <em>"the number of milliseconds"</em> it actually has a resolution of something like 10ms (or even worse). That's fine for a 50Hz framerate, but for 60Hz you'd be screwed.
<br />
<br />timeGetTime is a better alternative if you don't want to use the performance counter, because you can make some extra calls to adjust the resolution of timeGetTime so that you get a fair level of accuracy.

<br />
<br />Use clock_gettime() with CLOCK_MONOTONIC where available on POSIX and SUSv2 systems.
<br />
<br />Use gettimeofday() as a last resort, and have code to gracefully recover if it runs backwards, or jumps in time by too large an amount since the last call to it.
<br />
<br />You could also use ftime() as a last last resort. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />(But the same caveats for gettimeofday() apply for it as well)

<br />Some programs synchronize events to audio playback, which isn't very accurate when your sound card's crystal is really far from 44100 or 48000 Hz. I've worked on a Dell desktop PC whose onboard audio was noticeably flat.
