<br />
<br />I was introduced to Linux through work, ended up using Debian at home and have been very satisfied with it for years. However, if you want the power of Linux and the GUI simplicity of Windows, you can just get a Mac! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />One problem with a Mac is that there's a "Mac mini" but no "MacBook mini". Other companies' laptops come in small (9-10"), medium (13"), and desktop replacement (15-17"). Mac has medium (MacBook and MacBook Pro 13) and large (MacBook Pro 15 and 17). But instead of a small computer, Apple sells an appliance called the iPad, essentially an overgrown iPod Touch, which lacks features on which a lot of us rely. There <em>isn't</em> an app for that because Apple rejects entire classes of apps in the iPhone developer agreement.

<br />
<br />It's the perfect answer and I am always happy to see someone giving it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Of course anyone should use whatever suits their needs, and it's obvious that each of the three major players has that capability.
<br />
<br />Like Nessie was saying, it's heavy handed OS evangelism that is often both unhelpful and infuriating.

<br />I don't think I am allowed to switch OS's, or else I would try it, but I do want to try linux....

<br />Reading this though I think the only Linux I will want to get will be this, hopefully they simplify it!

<br />Only bad thing is that it's going to be built for people who basicly only browser the web :/.....But thats why it's linux, so we can fix it XD

<br />If you want to try Linux so hard but are not allowed to switch OS's, you still have a couple of options. A lot of Linux distros allow you to "preview" the OS without installing. You can boot from the CD/DVD and play with the OS a bit, without modifying anything on your hard drive.
<br />
<br />The other option is to use a virtual machine. VirtualBox for example is a free software that allows you to create and run virtual machines. You can create one and install Linux in it, while your real machine isn't affected in any way.

<br />It includes GCC and GNU Binutils. (The MinGW system is the Windows port of these.) On Ubuntu, you can pull these from Canonical's package repository by running this command in a terminal:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">sudo apt-get install build-essential</div>

<br />I guess this got looked over: 
<br />
<br />Just wanted to put my two cents in: If you're not to sure about using Linux (i.e. you have never used it) <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wubi-installer.org/">http://wubi-installer.org/</a><!-- m --> is a good thing to try. It installs Ubuntu just like a Windows application and you can remove it just as easily. Its really nice for someone who is new to Linux and may not want to make the commitment of formatting their HD and all.
<br />
<br />Anyway it installs exactly as a Windows application. If you want to remove it you uninstall it from the uninstall window. It allows you to dual boot your OS with Linux.
