It actually took less time to make a game.</div>Sorry I forgot to update this thread as well as the nintendoage thread.  We are still working on the judging.  Since this is a volunteer thing people have higher priorities.  Honestly the contest ended at a really bad time for me (final exams etc) so I wasn't about to put my education on hold and let this take all my priority.  On top of that there was some confusion about the judging and some people did not receive the judging criteria.  
<br />
<br />This is just meant to be fun and get some exposure on the NES homebrew community, I'm sorry that some people are upset by the way the contest is being run.  I will agree that it has been far from ideal.  Don't worry, it won't happen next time.  Lessons WELL learned.

<br />There were many problems with the compo, I just comment on this one. You is the organizer. You plan and decide when the contest ends. You probably know beforehand when you will have final exams or other time consuming things. When you choose the time when you, as organizer, have to do things that other people will expect from you, to overlap with the time when you will not be able to do these things, it is just a bad organization. That's that need to be improved for next time, because it is the reason for practically all the other problems.

<br />
<br />I sent him tepples other games and told him about MOE being a work in progress.
<br />
<br />But he'd love to do a review on homebrew gaming and would like to see any other games people are willing to share.  So let me know if you have any projects you'd like to share and possibly get some recognition for.

Looks like Shiru isn't the only one who has taken a stab at that game.
<br />
<br />Also have a little update.  We are just waiting for the last set of judging to come in and we will be able to announce the winners/distribute prizes etc!

Haven't seen this exact game and this game system, but no wonder there are similar games, considering that the <a href="http://www.bk-001x.land.ru/BK0010%28-01%29/Games/ASM/Opis/Kosilka.html" class="postlink">'original'</a> game I was inspired with was made in 1986, and probably was a clone by itself.
