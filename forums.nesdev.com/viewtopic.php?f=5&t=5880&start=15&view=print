<br />And about Aeris, I've always seen her refered as Aeris. Aerith probably come form other people that translated it from the japanese version (like on the OST titles) without caring about other languages. I might be wrong tough, and Cait Sith isn't Cait Sis.
<br />
<br />There is many other example of characters having many variants of their names in the FF series. Lydia/Ridia, Bartz/Butz, X-Death/Exdeath, Leonheart/Lionheart, etc... In fact I'd almost say half FF characters have variants of their names arround. When translating a name from japanese you probably want to fist check if it is an existing name or surname in a foreging language (such as it's the case with Seifer, Steiner or Lydia), if so then there is chances the japanese guys translated the name in japanese. Then you'd want to check if this word have a signification in another language (such as Cloud), many names originate from common words, or altered words. Of course with 2000+ lanauges in the world wich a million word in each it's kind of hard to check, but most names should mean something in Japanese, Chineese, Latin, Greek, German, Swedish, Arabic, Hebrew, or any variant of them. Then there is always chances they just made the name up randomly, in that case you couldn't claim a translation is better than another.

<br />With all "R" and "L" being equivalent, I wonder why nobody ever called the blue bomber "Lockman".

<br />Because that would sound like the Robot Master of closing offtopic and flamebait topics on forums, just like the <a href="http://pics.pineight.com/dwi/dancing_lock.gif" class="postlink">dancing lock</a>, <a href="http://pics.pineight.com/dwi/secret_bear.jpg" class="postlink">lock bear</a>, and <a href="http://pics.pineight.com/dwi/roadofloq.jpg" class="postlink">road of lock</a> I've seen on one DDR-related forum.

<br />Yeah, but it's still not a very clear message. When I read the original one, I understood it correctly. But then I realized we think as programmers. Just from looking at the number 2 we think of a counter and when that counter expires, the game is over. But a regular person could interpret they'd be forgiven twice and be kicked out on the 3rd time only.
