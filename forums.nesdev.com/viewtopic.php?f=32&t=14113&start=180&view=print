This is something that needs to be looked at before we announce the official rules. I have posted below the 2014/2011 and Ludum Dare judging criteria.  Honestly I'm leaning more towards a Ludum Dare format where each category is judged out of 5 stars, and if for some reason a category does not fit an entry, then it can be N/A and won't be counted towards the full marks for the entry.  I figure this is a good way to even the playing field if someone submits something like a test rom.  As for categories, this is something I would like some input on.</div><br />Overall should be a category on its own; it should not be the sum or average of the other categories.<br /><br />Here is the category spread I recommend:<br /><br /><ul><li>Overall</li><li>Innovation</li><li>Gameplay and Control</li><li>Graphics</li><li>Sound</li><li>Tone and Mood</li><li>Polish and Completeness</li><li>Community</li></ul>

I feel like that should instead be a consideration for the Overall category, since it's sort of a 'more than the sum of its parts' thing. Other than that I agree with Pubby's suggestion.

Look at it this way: it's like the Academy Awards. Not every Oscar-worthy movie will be in the running for Makeup, or Special Effects, or whatever, and in the same vein, not every contest entry will be in the running for Tone and Mood. But for games that do focus on tone and mood, I think it's fair to acknowledge what they attempted with a category.<br /><br />Honestly, the more categories the better. It allows more people to win that way.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">NESHomebrew wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Are you guys thinking weighted categories like previously, or the 5-star system?</div><br />5-stars per category, with &quot;overall&quot; being the only category to have monetary prizes. That's simple enough.<br /><br />I hope I'm not being too assertive on this whole judging thing.

The judging was always the hardest part of this competition.

For the last competition the entrants were all judged by their fellow competitors, with the incentive being that if you judged, you would get a full score counted towards your entry. This seemed more fair than the panel of judges from previous competitions.<br /><br />Also, depending on the amount of entries, an audience probably wouldn't have the time or patience to try every entry and compare them all.

(that still seems excessive to me, but delaying for half of that time to make the PRGE would make more sense to me)<br /><br />On a side note, I'm going to be wrapping up the rough draft of my game engine over the next few days, and I plan to spend the next month doing graphics for myself and some others. Among those projects is doing a rough draft of the NESdev Compo 2016 t-shirt. So far the only suggestion I've read is the logo. The 3d text would be doable but I'm not convinced that it would look great on a shirt. I think the &quot;NesDev&quot; font in flat text would be workable with more pop on a shirt than 3d text.<br /><br />If anybody has any more suggestions I'd be happy to hear them.<br /><br />As for judging,<br /><br />I don't know if community should be rated as part of the main category. I'd like to do a lot of stuff in the community category for my project, and that's great for the game and for the Compo, but I don't feel like it's particularly fair to group that in with judging of the quality of a game.<br /><br />There was a suggestion at one point of a &quot;best progress thread&quot; or perhaps &quot;best community involvement&quot;. I'm not sure what the prize would be. Something to increase exposure would probably be sufficient.
