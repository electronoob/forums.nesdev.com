		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Recently I have been looking at lockout defeaters and found some interesting results.  First I got a cpu 11 version nes system which I believe is the last toaster version.  Then I tested tons of third party carts to see which worked.  From the ones I have only a few from Wisdom Tree worked.  AVE and Camerica games did not work.  Opening them up showed they are Color Dreams version #3 ( see KH site <a href="http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/lockout/cdreams2.html" class="postlink">http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/lockout/cdreams2.html</a> )  Next I added switches on the lines to the lockout, which showed only the attack on the reset line was doing anything.  The protections added on the nes board prevent the data line attack from doing anything.  Then I wondered why it would take ~7 reset cycles for the defeater to work.  Instead of pulsing the defeater I connected the d2 input directly to ground.  This made the defeater work immediately with no reset cycles.  Any reason they didnt do this in the first place?
<br />
<br />Now for some analog messyness...  The defeater just puts -5v onto the reset line.  However connecting the reset line directly to the -5v on the ICL 7660 chip does not work.  The transistors must be doing some kind of amplification because both are needed.  The 74ls377 is also needed.  Connecting the defeater input directly to ground doesnt work but connecting it to ground through the 74ls377 does.  Maybe it is acting like another transistor amplifier.
<br />
<br />I like to pretend everything is digital so I dont really understand what is happening with all this analog stuff.  Anyone else have suggestions?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />More interesting stuff:  the lockout defeater works by making the lockout chip crash.  This means the reset button on the front of the NES no longer works because it goes through the chip.  It also means you can pull out the cart without the NES being reset.  Should be able to find out how much time the stun is needed so it wouldnt drain too much power on systems with no lockout chip....

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />bunny, I'm not sure I completely understand what your conclusion was regarding the best lockout defeat mechanism.  If I'm reading it right, you say that some variant of the Color Dreams #3 is working best for you?  Just curious because I'm going to be making some flash cart PCB's sometime soon, and I'd rather not have to scavenge lockout chips off of working carts.  If anyone has non-working carts they'd like to donate though...

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That is the conclusion, that the best lockout defeater will be the color dreams #3 section that attaches to cart pin 70 plus a timer.  Next step is to put a new program on the color dreams cart that figures out exactly how long and when the defeater needs to be active.  That way the defeater can be turned off before the lockout chip overheats too much.  Final design could just have a 555 timer in monostable mode activating the lockout.  The data or sync signal from the lockout in the nes could trigger the defeater for a short amount of time.  That way if there is no lockout chip, the defeater would not be sucking power.  Figuring out the lockout protocol would still be better, but that is looking pretty hard....
<br />
<br />Anyone know if the lockout pins in the top loader are unconnected or grounded?

<br />
<br />pin 7 (70 on cart edge) is connected directly to VCC, the others seem to be unconnected (except VCC/GND of course).  I checked with ohmmeter also, didn't show anything (except 330ohms between VCC and GND, weird).
