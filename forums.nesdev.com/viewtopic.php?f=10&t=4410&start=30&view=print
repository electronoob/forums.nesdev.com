<br />Most likely. You should never expect a mapper (real or emulated) to start up in any given state unless it is specifically designed to do so.

<br />
<br />And this was my issue. Thanks for confirming it. 
<br />
<br />It took me sometime to understand how it work because the wiki's information is a little bit ambiguous or the layout is not appropriate.  For example, the register modes bits explanation is given with $8001 when it should be located just under the one of $8000. So I tough that I had to write one of those flags in $8001, which is wrong. 
<br />
<br />I realized about it once I did some research on the forum.  I ended up on in an emulation thread that was talking about those register and saw again those "mode" for $8000 and not in $8001.
<br />
<br />Maybe I should update the layout on the wiki. 
<br />
<br />Now I was able to make it work because of a little bit of luck. When it was time to select my bank, I saw in the neotoxin code that he was shifting the bit left once before writing the bank number.
<br />
<br />I would like to know why is that so because the Wiki doesn't say anything about it.  I'm sure someone knows the answer to this?

<br />iNES bank numbers (16 KiB each) need to be shifted to the left once before they will work as MMC3 bank numbers (8 KiB each). Then bit 0 selects the lower half or upper half of the 16 KiB bank.

<br />
<br />I see.  Once explained that way and after re-reading the wiki, it make sense. I was just calculating banks the way iNes does and that's why I was confused. I feel a little bit stupid to have asked this but now at least I'm an educated idiot <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Thanks for the clarification Tepples.
<br />
<br />The way that you explain bit 0 is one way to see it if your banks are defined in 16k chunks.  Do most people define their banks in 16k or 8k chunks? I guess it depends on what inside.
<br />
<br />I will still think about updating the wiki regarding the registers part because this is what confused me in the first place.

<br />And on the mapper you are using. With the MMC3 it makes sense to have the banks as 8KB chunks, unless you plan on always switching them in pairs, in which case you could treat them as 16KB banks.
<br />
<br />There are many things that seem confusing at first, because of the names used, the old iNES header, and so on. Try to see past these conventions and understand what's going on. Bankswitching is just the mapper controlling the higher address lines of the chip depending on what areas of memory are being accessed. There really isn't such thing as a "bank", this is just a name to make the concept easier to grasp (but sometimes that doesn't allow people to see the whole picture).

<br />
<br />I kind of new what the concept was since long time ago under dos the same concept was used for EMS memory (I didn't had the chance to use that kind of memory at the time, didn't know much about programming yet).
<br />
<br />So I wanted to take bank N and put it at location $8000, quite a simple task. But after reading the wiki, I was more confused than anything else at first.  The wiki is more about explaining the hardware and not on how to use it in software.  And since one information was at the wrong location, I didn't understand what was the register  RRR at $8000 since the information was shown under register $8001.
<br />
<br />With all the small issues that I had one after an another, I almost feel like writing some very short tutorials on every step that I blocked and put them on the wiki. The problem right now is my time it too limited so I have to decide between writing more code or writing tutorials. For now, I feel more like coding than being a tech writer <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />It happens a lot. At the very moment we get how something works we can easily tell what's wrong with the current documentation, but never really seem to find the time to fix it. Also, since we're learning, we're not very confident to write tutorials either (the few who do become famous because of their inaccurate tutorials). Then, once we're way past that, we simply can't remember what it was to be a newbie anymore, because that perspective simply goes away with time. This means the documentation never becomes newbie-friendly.
<br />
<br />It's all a cycle my friend, and now you're becoming a part of it! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

At first my test were all CHR-ROM based but now I switched to ram.  I may experiment with both format for educational purpose only but for now my goal is to use CHR-RAM.  Many well knows game uses this format like Ninja gaiden, Bionic Commando, Castlevania, most of the mega man  etc. (I could be wrong about some, I don't remember all of them by heart) so since it's my first project and may be less intensive on the graphic, this will make things easier. And when it will be time to make the dev-cart, only 1 chip to care about.  <br /><br />Now I need to find a proper compression algorithm and find a way to store my data.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Then, once we're way past that, we simply can't remember what it was to be a newbie anymore, because that perspective simply goes away with time.

<br />
<br />That's why is seemed so important to me to write those things since I'm still in that thinking pattern. Time is my enemy and soon my way of seeing thing will change.
