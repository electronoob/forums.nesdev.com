By modern standards (Rec. 601), which specify an active scanline period equal to 280 TMS9918 pixels, this is an 80% title safe area to account for the tolerances of 1970s TVs. By the sixth generation (PS2, GameCube, Xbox), as TVs became manufactured to tighter tolerances, console makers started allowing an 85% title safe area, which in TMS9918 terms would be 238x204 pixels.

I actually redid the picture adding in red into the &quot;gray&quot; palette I already had, redesigned the springboard (the gray box with an up arrow) and redid the &quot;tower&quot; with one less shade of gray, had to use some more dithering but it doesn't look to bad IMO, but the dithering might not look as good on a real NES (this is probably true for a lot of the dithering I have used in my mockups). <br /><br />Anyway this is how it looks now, I squeezed everything together a little to still show the house but also show a little more of the tower.<br /><br />This will probably be the last update to Wonderboy III, I have done an almost complete mockup of Golden Axe Warrior which I will add real soon. <br /><br /><img src="http://driar.se/pic/nes/wonderboy3_changedpalette.png" alt="Image" />

In an NES port, if the levels were 16x13 (like in the picture), they would have only half as many blocks to work with. However, if levels were 2 nametables wide (32x13) the block count would be identical.<br /><br />One of my goals was to make it look decent for any background color from the first row (ie the darkest).<br /><br />There's still a few things I'm not quite happy about (eg. the 1-up graphic). Also, if anybody has any suggestions for a better palette for the gold, I'd gladly take it.

The player changes color when you get a new armor (same as the rings in Zelda 1) and the magic bar fills up all the way to the edge of the screen. Sure it could be shortened but I think it would be nicer if it would stay the same. The &quot;scale&quot; holds the orbs you get when finishing a castle, it's basically the triforce. On the Master System all orbs are different colors but here they would all have to look the same, no biggie.<br /><br />Here's an update to Golden Axe Warrior using palette changes, there's two scanlines of black in the beginning of the status bar, and three of the palettes are changed. <br /><br /><img src="http://driar.se/pic/nes/goldenaxewarrior_statusbar.png" alt="Image" />

This basically means it can only be used for bottom status bars.<br />It's <em>conceivable</em> that there are specific (mid-scanline) times when you could disable and re-enable rendering such that it would not damage sprites (during the time that OAMADDR is 0), but it would produce an irregular edges on the relevant scanline.</div><br /><br />I have no idea if any games actually did this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It might not be on par for the thread (this asks for mockups of non-NES games on NES hardware), but this is something I wanted to do.  I tried my best to 'dissect' the infamous <a href="http://greatgatsbygame.com/" class="postlink">Great Gatsby &quot;NES Prototype&quot;</a>, and come up with a palette that it might've used as an NES game.  I apologize beforehand for the large image.<br /><br /><img src="http://i59.tinypic.com/2v3kjy8.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The game uses some very odd graphics placement, and it seems to be able to lay down a background attribute to a space as small as 8*8.  If this were an MMC5 game, it would be feasible, but using a mapper as advanced and expensive as the MMC5 for a game with only four levels is quite a waste.  Not to mention, I haven't actually tried making up an NES mockup of the graphics, and the palette seems to be based on an MSPaint estimate of the palette.  The game runs at 240p as opposed to 224 for NTSC regions, so the playfield would have to be shrunken down a little.  There's also some discrepancies with the colors, most importantly the chandelier; you could probably get away with layering the sprites, but they fall down, and would cause a LOT of flicker when they do.<br /><br />So what do you think?
