		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Bah, I'm getting pretty annoyed trying to design mappers with PowerPak. Anyone else out there working on mappers with it? Anyone wanna finish off my MMC1 and MMC3? 
<br />
<br />My MMC1's shift register doesn't work (I'm sure the logic is right), it seems to need a delay and I have no idea how to use the FPGA's "delay locked loop." Unfortunately you can't just add a bunch of buffers together because they're optimized out. I'm going to try using the falling edge of Phi2 for the job but if that doesn't work, I'm out of ideas.
<br />
<br />My MMC3's scanline counter doesn't work (looks like propagation issues or we don't have the logic quite right) and I'm not sure if the switch static banks feature works since I can't get Mario 3 started.
<br />
<br />For both problems I don't wanna hack it with the 20 MHz clock, it should be doable without it since the FPGA is &lt;30ns!

<br />
<br />My shift reg is LSB first, I dunno what I could have possibly done wrong with it. I took your suggestion though and am now using a stock 4-bit shift reg with the outputs reversed.
<br />
<br />The counter could very well be the problem but looking at the datasheet everything is OK. The state resets to 0 and counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2...

<br />I've uploaded my project files (modified bunnyboy's CNROM) in case someone wants another more elaborate example. If someone does fix it, please show how!

<br />May I be so bold as to ask or rather make a request for a mapper. Ive always wanted to play Buzz and Waldog on a real NES instead of an EMU.
<br />
<br />If possible thank you in advance.

<br />Seen as I have no idea on how to implement my own I was looking forward to some of the members of this forum creating more.
<br />
<br />Still I hope one day someone can get around mapper 156 (Buzz and Waldog).
<br />
<br />I appreciate all the efforts that have been put forth so far.
<br />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've quickly become bored and frustrated with it; some of my designs which work on a CPLD board do not work with the PowerPak and I can't figure out why. I have also made some designs using Xilinx primitives which Foundation refused to fit because of the crappy fitter, not the FPGA size. I also haven't resolved WRAM problems, I've tried disabling WRAM every way I can think of but it's still there and breaks many older Famicom games which would work otherwise.
<br />
<br />When motivation comes around I'll do common mappers with the ability to get back to the menu with a controller instead of the reset button and a cheat toggle hotkey but that'll probably be it from me unless I can get all my broken FC mappers working.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />FWIW, I think it may be easier for some (including myself) to do a mapper primarily in an HDL (Verilog or VHDL), rather than using only schematics.  Maybe for disabling WRAM, you could fake it by emulating open bus for reads of disabled WRAM - detect the high address byte of the read and force that into the CPU data bus input.  But I'm assuming none of this hasn't been done yet.
