		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'll disagree that the two BK games have copy pasted engines. Sivak has at least said in his play through commentary that he implemented proper trigonometry tables, and variable rate timers. Which is a huge difference in how things move. I say the 2nd game sometimes feels like running through literal clockwork.<br /><br />but to get back on topic, what's going good for the Mystic Searches team is the focus of designing the whole game, not just programing it. It is a good thing to not be concerned with state of the art programing practices, so that things actually get done. I know, because I've practiced the antithesis, perfectionism, for so long.

Don't forget, lots of games are made using the same game engine or the same libraries, which is no different from what you're complaining about.<br /><br />(this is the only post I'll make on this matter, because derailing)

If I took a sound engine, took my okay animation/display engine, then just made a generic core engine, that is simple, could have a game out in 3 months if needed. But perfection, and real development takes time, like the year they give themselves on this title, although I'm sure it'll use generic tools too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Don't a lot of NES games reuse engines and assets whenever possible?  I remember Kasumi mentioning that something as arbitrary as a text dialogue box takes an absurd amount of time to design and implement (in an NES game), so it'd be fair to reuse something that took a long time to make.  I also noticed that Mega Man's sprite, especially in 3 onwards, looked incredibly archaic in contrast to the newer design cues in, say, 6, and Capcom are the masters of reusing assets for as long as possible.<br /><br />Speaking of reusing assets, didn't some early NES games share similar voice samples and sound?  For example, Defender II has the same sounds and music as Punch-Out, and Kung Fu Heroes uses the 1-up sound from Mario and the voice samples from Kung-Fu, completely unrelated games.

(Bosses still often get drawn from SotN.)<br /><br />Also surprised you didn't point at MM9 or 10.<br /><br />edit: They do mention on the KS page that it's a &quot;work of passion&quot; or &quot;labor of love&quot; so yes, they know they're not really paying themselves, but still...I agree that it's quite something to do a documentary, two connected games with a hardware issue (and a third for $10k)...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I didn't mention 9 and 10 because they are not NES games.  NES programming is <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">much</span></em></strong> less approachable than anything modern, which would justify asset reuse.  As mentioned before, something that people take for granted like a text box takes weeks to develop, and about a month or two for it to be implemented.<br /><br />Also, Adventure Island 3 is almost a literal rehash of Adventure Island 2.  In fact, I dare say AI3 is a glorified level hack of AI2.  They reuse much of the same graphical assets, the music, sound effects, mechanics, and levels.  Only thing different is that the pointless &quot;choose an egg&quot; room has been removed, which speeds the game up considerably.
