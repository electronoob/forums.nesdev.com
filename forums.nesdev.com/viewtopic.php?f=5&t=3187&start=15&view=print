<br />
<br />And again, I'm really hoping someone will actually start making believable NWC fakes as was discussed earlier on this board. Preferably so identical to the real ones that you'd need a chemist's lab to dismiss it as a fake. Then at least the collector species would have to get somewhat educated in NES hardware.

This is a good thing to have protected because it means that cheapie imitators can't just blatantly use your work for their own profit without your permission and any strings attached to that permission (royalties, etc.) This doesn't always stop them, but it does give the creator legal recourse in the event of naked rip-offs. Because IP is protected, artists/musicians/programmers have an incentive to put real effort into their work, knowing that it will remain theirs and theirs alone. So, no, blargg, I don't find the concept absurd at all.
<br />
<br />Now I will agree that intellectual property/copyright laws are in need of reform.

<br />Except for diamonds, there is an end in sight: the patents on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultured_diamond#Synthetic_gems" class="postlink">cultured diamond production methods</a> will expire in the 2020s. Unfortunately, Sonny Bono and friends screwed up that line of thinking for carts. This is another reason why people should avoid using the vague term "intellectual property" to refer to both 20-year and 95-year grants of exclusive rights.

<br />That is so true ! As a gamer, I love games, regardless if they were released in 2007 or in 1983. The main reason old systems interestes me it's because it's a lot easier to understand technically, so I prefer knowing a lot of things about a console released in 1983 than knowing fake suff for a console released recently. And they know a lot of fake stuff for both old and new machines. And they say the love old games by rasing their price ridiculously and make them eat dust.
<br />
<br />And about the intellectual propriety : This remember me that page by Nintendo against emulation, they didn't stop to say "this is a horrid intellectual propriety infrigement to Nintendo", etc, etc... This just have few meaning, the actual meaning of this is that they want to sell a lot of NES games on Wii's virtual console instead of having them downloaded for free.

I only have one single game for collection purposes - Just Breed. I already finished the game in emulation and the game is hardly playable in japanese (at least for me).

<br />Well you can have mine when you pry it from my cold dead fingers ... seriously I had that and DH for 11 months before i got a new game I played the crap out of that game ... just wish my ROB hadnt broken.
<br />
<br />As a Gamer ... I cant stand the people that collect to make money ... the collector that collects for the love of the games or the memories that the collection brings back is fine by me.
<br />
<br />As a collector ... if i had a really rare cart I would not charge for it to be dumped per se but unless I knew the person doing the dumping IRL then I would want collataral to make sure the person did not run off with my cart.  
<br />
<br />In reguards to IP ... I have my own rules for that that does not adhear to the law
<br />
<br />1) is the company who owns  the IP actively using it to make money if so are they charging a fair price ... if yes to both ... I buy it.
<br />
<br />IMO copyright and patent term lengths are redicously long. And any company not actively making said product avaliable to the public than too bad soo sad you loose your rights to it.

<br />
<br />I hacked up an Uncharted Waters and put the translated version of Just Breed on there. I also tapped one of pins of the MMC5 (pin 1,2 or 3, I can't remember), to get the extra sound channels.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure what other MMC5 carts have battery backup. Or I suppose you could hack up a real Just Breed cart.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Uncharted Waters have 16kB SRAM while Just Breed uses only 8kB, but it will still work fine with 16kB. To have extra sound, you'd just have to add resistors and capacitors on the free slots on the PCB and then mix the sound inside the NES by modifing it somehow (I also did this, but with pin 18 instead of pin 54 wich is "officially" used by NES board).
<br />Without buying the japanese Just Breed cart, I could never have figured this stuff out.
