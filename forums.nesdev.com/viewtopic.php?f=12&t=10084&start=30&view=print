Literally a drop-in replacement.  For Pokemon, you want the <a href="http://www.ramtron.com/products/nonvolatile-memory/parallel-product.aspx?id=133" class="postlink">Ramtron (now Cypress) FM18W08</a>.  If the battery dies, you still lose the RTC, but you won't lose your save, and you can replace the battery at your leisure (or not, and just set the clock every time you start playing...).  For SNES, it requires some glue logic on the /CS line.  I've worked out a PCB that should work for the 64k and 256k RAM chips as a drop-in replacement, using the Ramtron FM18W08 (same as for the Gameboy) for 256k, or the FM16W08 for 64k, and a 74HTC00 for the /CS logic.  If you're interested, once I get PCB's in, I'll probably sell a couple, as I don't really have that many SNES games that I want to modify this way.

There are Legend of Zelda cartridge with their original batteries from the late 1980s that still retain their SRAM contents. That's pretty long term.

I found it curious that the fake DMA transfer could corrupt WRAM anyway, but apparently something was happening.</div><br />I did a test and found no corruption in the 128K DRAM after swapping a few carts in and out for about two minutes. Didn't test the first $500 bytes since the test code was there.<br /><br />I don't know whether I got corruption before. If so, it may have been because my loop-in-DMA was writing to some registers (INIDISP and MDMEN) in the loop. Er and the other 7 DMA channels were continuously writing to a PPU register. So constant /WR assertion on the bus. For the test I just did, I used a delay loop like yours without any writes.

Absolutely.  Long-term in terms of how much longer will it last?  Maybe not so much.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My point is you can backup the data and replace the battery and be good for another long term of time. Which is more simple than replacing the SRAM with a non-volatile memory like FRAM. No to mention in the case of certain games, the battery backed RAM also serves as expanded general purpose RAM which may wear out certain non-volatile replacements.

Even if the FRAM will exceed the life of one battery, it won't exceed the total repairability.<br /><br />(Counterargument: Who knows how long NES/SNES/PCBs will remain viable?)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have hope that by the time NES consoles start failing hard, there will be an open-source gate-for-gate replica of the NES and all mappers in Verilog. The Visual 2A03 and Visual 2C02 increase my faith in this, as in theory a netlist could be extracted from that. At that point it'll become easy to build an FPGA NES or (with enough up-front investment for tooling) to get a Chinese company to build a dead-on accurate NOAC.

So you could make a programmable cartridge out of it like you normally do for Flash memory? <br /><br />So then FeRAM is something different? I recall Sonic 3 using something like that, and it certainly did have a limited write cycle lifespan.

You can get 4Mbit in TSOP, but it's 16-bit wide, and only 3v.
