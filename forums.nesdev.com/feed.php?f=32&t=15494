I must have been blind.<br /><br />If you check the walkably of the pixel right beneath the player (just outside the bounding box), it doesn't matter which subpixel value the y coordinate has. It will detect the floor whenever there's one and not if the player is airborne.<br /><br />Checking when this variable changes, and then saving the respawn info, plus saving it when the player jumps as well looks like the optimal solution.<br /><br />But, as you say, saving when jumping is enough for this game.

So, is this statement correct? <em>the continous flip-flopping between &quot;is  falling&quot; and &quot;is standing&quot; while walking needs to be conditioned into a continous &quot;is standing&quot;</em>.<br /><br />For the record, i think your current checkpoint mechanism works perfectly fine for this particular game and level layout, simply because of the high and relatively stable frequency a player will trig it. Introducing more (and varying reasons for) checkpoints potentially also means opening more gateways to hard-to-foresee glitches, cheats, bugs. And the edge between &quot;is falling&quot; / &quot;is standing&quot; as a replacement for &quot;is jumping&quot; poses the possibility of placing the player in a tough spot. Just maybe. Feels like a thing that needs to be tested for a while. Probably not too bad?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Wed Feb 08, 2017 6:14 am</p><hr />

No, you misunderstood me. I don't have problems with the collision check, it's *very* lightweight, no need to translate to assembly. I have my data very well organized and calculations are few and fast. My concerns have to do with the fact that:<br /><br />- Maybe storing the safe spot *when* you are on the floor instead of just when the player jumps would be more fair to the player.<br />- Storing all the actors positions could take some time.<br />- Every Nth frame, when you are on the floor, the collision is detected. This happens because the way G affects VY and VY affects Y causes subpixel increments during a couple of frames, so collision doesn't register as it is calculated at a pixel scale. So detecting the transition of &quot;I am falling&quot; -&gt; &quot;I am on the floor&quot; happens very often while just walking.<br /><br />I don't think I'm making myself clear, sorry, I'll try to use numbers. I am using 4 bits of subpixel precision (1/16th of a pixel).<br /><br />Let's start with the player on the floor, y_pixel = 32; y = y_pixel&lt;&lt;4 = 512, vy = 0; . Player is standing on a tile (floor).<br /><br />- Frame 1, vy += G -&gt; vy = 4; y += vy -&gt; y = 516. y_pixel = 516&gt;&gt;4 = 32. No collision.<br />- Frame 2, vy += G -&gt; vy = 8; y += vy -&gt; y = 524. y_pixel = 524&gt;&gt;4 = 32. No collision.<br />- Frame 3, vy += G -&gt; vy = 12; y+= vy -&gt; y = 536. y_pixel = 536&gt;&gt;4 = 33. Collision! <br /><br />In frame 3, collision is registered in the bottom of the sprite (there's a platform there and the lower end of the bounding box is inside such platform), so vy = 0 and y is repositioned just over the floor (y_pixel = 32).<br /><br />Then back to frame 1.<br /><br />Notice how during frames 1 and 2 the player is actually falling, in a subpixel scale.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6012">na_th_an</a> — Wed Feb 08, 2017 6:00 am</p><hr />

You might get a lot more mileage out of just rewriting the collision check in assembly instead of trying to do it less?<br /><br />In my game a point collision against the background takes less than 100 cycles; it's not inappropriate or a problem to be doing 30 or 40 checks in a frame. If it was taking, e.g. 1000 cycles because it was written in C, it would be out of the question to do that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Wed Feb 08, 2017 5:04 am</p><hr />

What would happen if you change that sequence to: Attempt at adding Vy to y (the above condition check + collision goes here)? <br /><br />My reasoning: In order for the procedure to be more lightweight, something that takes down the frequency of the procedure should be plugged in somewhere, preferrably near the root of causality. If vy isn't added to y because of a check, no movement needs to happen.  Though, i think you'd need to keep upwards and downwards y alterations separate for it to work with jumping.

Well, it's *very* simple and it seems to work in the games I've implemented it, as it is a spot where you won't fall to certain death on respawn, and the timed invincibility grants no baddies will harm you, but it has its limitations:<br /><br />- As mentioned, you can't respawn on a moving platform. If you are planning for a segment in which you have to advance jumping through a series moving platforms, the respawn will place you far behind and this may seem unfair.<br />- If conveyors are implemented, maybe the respawning spot is not that safe. Imagine you jump from the edge of a conveyor in the last minute.<br />- You (as the game designer) don't really have control. It may result on unwanted / exploitable glitches, or unfair situations. Imagine you descend like 8 screens without having to jump, then get killed. Back to top! [*]<br /><br />@FrankenGraphics, I like your idea. I can detect if the jump is from a platform (in fact, I am using such detection to *not* register a &quot;safe spot&quot;). I could easily save the platform status. I could even take a snapshot of the values of every moving object on screen, and restore it alongside the player position. In fact, I think I'm going to try this on Goddess to see how it works.<br /><br />I always need to KISS (yet effective) as I'm coding in C and have to cope with the overhead.<br /><br />[*] This issue could be solved registering a safe spot everytime the player hits the ground. I could have implemented this but that would result in having to register the safe spot (much) more often, and every cycle counts. Maybe it's a fault in my engine, but usually you are registering a collision with the floor every frame as you walk.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6012">na_th_an</a> — Wed Feb 08, 2017 2:47 am</p><hr />

Correction: That's <em>ingeniously</em> simple. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> Now knowing this, i should say the omission of moving platforms are noticeable (they are percieved as longer, irregular gaps in the timeline). If you wanted to expand on that, you could check for a moving platform collision detection to be true at each jump press, in which case the init position of that platform + centering offset would be stored instead of the actual position. Some additional playtesting involved, but that's much quicker than checking every corner for side effects of altered jumping mechanisms.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Tue Feb 07, 2017 2:21 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">na_th_an wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Interesting.<br /><br />The jumping mechanism is as follows:<br /><br />- Every frame, vy is added to y. <br />- G is added to vy.<br />- When A is pressed, jumping starts. vy gets a negative boost. Such boost is applied to vy in a decreasing manner as long as time passes during a maximum of 16 frames.<br /></div><br /><br />This is why it has a strange jump curve, then. When an actor jumps, dy (or vy in your case) is generally set to an upwards (negative) value as a one-shot, and then a gravity constant is added every tick to slow this upwards acceleration until it eventually becomes downwards acceleration. To continuously boost vy upwards would drag the actor upwards, increasingly quickly. That makes sense for something bobbing to the surface under water, or if the actor has a jetpack or other propulsion apparatus, but for a jump it seems inappropriate. <br /><br />Some Virgin games for Genesis (Cool Spot, Aladdin, Earthworm Jim) jump with this same strange curve, while others (Lion King) do it in a more sensible way.<br /><br />EDIT: Argh, I'm a page late. Having an unusual jump isn't necessarily a bad thing, but getting the more typical parabolic curve might make it feel more natural to those used to other platformers. As others have written, it is a matter of whether or not it is worth changing the mechanic, then testing and adjusting the rest of the game to match.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5314">mikejmoffitt</a> — Tue Feb 07, 2017 12:51 pm</p><hr />

That model is equivalent to &quot;When A is released for the first time in each jump, multiply upward velocity by 1/4.&quot;<br /><br />Say the normal jump velocity is 1000 decreasing to 0 at the peak, and the clamp value is 250 decreasing to 0 at the peak. Then A is released when upward velocity is 600. By that time, the clamp value will be 150.<br /><br />Don't mind me; I'm just trying to golf down the size of each algorithm's required state. Here, I've reduced it to one bit: &quot;has clamp already been applied since this jump began?&quot;.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Tue Feb 07, 2017 11:46 am</p><hr />
