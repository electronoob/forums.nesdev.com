		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In my game, I'm only going to have 1 target at any time, so I just want to know whether I found a hit or not.<br /><br />If I've understood this correctly, it's not enough to just read from the zapper - it needs to be done while the frame is being drawn, because the light sensor turns off after a very short time compared to my eyes, which perceive the white area on the screen as being constantly white.<br /><br />So how do I do this? One idea was to poll $2002 for vblank to end and then have a loop that polls $2002 for vblank to start and $4017 for a hit, or that polls just $4017 while waiting for nmi... how would you more experienced people do it?<br /><br />Also, are there other light sources I could use, for debugging and such? What kind of light, specifically, does the zapper detect?

If you just want a Y coordinate (as used in ZapPing), you can leave the whole screen bright and count scanlines.<br /><br />Otherwise, darken the screen except for the targets and use the Y coordinate to narrow down which target was hit. If this Y coordinate is close to more than one target (not the case in 1 DUCK, but possible for 2 DUCKS or CLAY SHOOTING), turn each on individually. The Zap Ruder menu has two target groups: the boxes on the left and the boxes on the right. When the photodiode turns on, it darkens the groups in sequence over the course of the next two frames and moves the cursor to that group if darkening the group caused the photodiode to turn off.<br /><br />In my experience, the Zapper's photodiode will turn on reliably when the color in the target area is $10 (light gray), $20-$2C (white and bright colors), or $30-$3C (white and pale colors). It's still unclear whether or not the IC in the Zapper includes a resonator at 15.7 kHz (SDTV horizontal scan rate) to distinguish TV light from other light sources.
