Also, with a complete game out pirates will hopefully feel less tempted to dump and release a ROM of the cart version.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Dec 27, 2009 9:34 pm</p><hr />

There are two distinctions to be made: 1. what you mean by "selling" and 2. what you mean by the difference between your library and a work using your library.<br /><br /><strong>"Selling"</strong><br /><a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html" class="postlink">The GNU project's list of confusing words</a> is a bit biased toward free software, but reading through it does help clear up your thinking. One can <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#SellSoftware" class="postlink">split "selling"</a> into the steps of A. distributing copies for a fee and B. restricting further distribution with copyright. A+B is the model of the commercial video game industry, B alone is freeware, and A alone is "Linux distribution discs for people with slow Internet".<br /><br /><strong>"A product that uses it"</strong><br />Distributing a free software product that contains your codec involves distributing your codec because your codec makes up part of the product's source code.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I do think people who sell games without also providing free downloads are kinda hypocrites though.<br /></div><br />Including developers of mainstream commercial games?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I plan on selling my games one day too, but as a complement to the free download, which I expect people to buy because of the extras: cart, artwork, manual, box, and so on...<br /></div><br />Likewise, I'm planning to provide a Free demo for free download, along with a value-added proprietary commercial version that will be Freed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_pledge_system" class="postlink">once I hit the donation target</a>.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The <a href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/zlib_license.html" class="postlink">license of another widely used data compression library</a> looks right for you.<br /></div><br />Looks good enough. Do I just copy the text?</div><br />Just paste the license text as a comment at the top of each source code file.<br /><br />And as for bureauracy, it's a necessary evil in this world of Sonny Bono century-long copyright and circumvention bans. A license just determines how and how often your library will be used. Permissive licenses (like zlib and BSD), weak copyleft licenses (like MPL and LGPL), and strong copyleft licenses (like GPL) have their own associated philosophies. For one thing, they trade off freedom for developers vs. freedom for users.<br /><br />I've split off the licensing discussion from the technical discussion.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Dec 27, 2009 6:38 pm</p><hr />

I went through the trouble of reverse engineering the format, making an encoder and a decoder and in the end released all my findings and work so that others could take advantage of it as well, so the least someone who finds this useful can do is release their own work on this for others (including me) to use.

I don't often use other people's code, I at most draw some inspiration from existing code. Also, most of my programming is just personal experiences that stay on my own hard drive, so I never really had to bother about reading licenses. Since I don't release many programs, I never bothered selecting a license for the few that do get released.
