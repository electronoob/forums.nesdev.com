I don't think it's easy to find on MercadoLivre, since most of 60-72 adapters have no chip inside to make a Famicom cart playable in a NES.<br /><br />I got the F1 Race cart, but I'm unable to test it, since my famiclone has a broken reset button, and my NES doesn't run it with the adapter I have.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Many Gyromite carts with 5 screws have adapters inside. In addition to the 5 screws, the cart connector is also important for identifying adapters, as illustrated in <a href="http://www.racketboy.com/retro/hacks/gyromite-nes-import-adapter-guide" class="postlink">this page</a>.  I had to go through a few Gyromite carts before I found 2 that had adapters in them, and those were the 2 that had both characteristics: 5 screws and little lines extending from the side of the connector pins.<br /><br />Unfortunately there are very few Gyromite carts available on MercadoLivre right now, and the connectors are not visible in any of the pictures (plus, the carts are expensive as shit!).

Plug in the game genie with no game. if the NES resets itself every second like when there is no cartridge, then no, it won't work. If it stays on, then you are fine.<br /><br />I am assuming this question pertains to the presence of the lockout IC present in a standard cartridge and the gyromite-style embedded adapter (which most adapters will not have a suitable solution for).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't recommand the Gyromite adapter AT ALL.<br /><br />I had to import a Gyromite cart all the way from USA just to get the adapter, and now it's eating dust in a drawer half destroyed somewhere. Because it's really impractical, ideally you'd have to place the PCB in the NES cart, and close it again and use it as a normal NES cart, but this only works for NROM-like Famicom PCBs, not very useful. Otherwise you'll have to deal with a bare PCB and trying to insert it into your NES, which is a terribly hard and annoying thing to do for both the front loader (you don't see what you're doing) and toploader (the connector is protected by a &quot;clapet&quot; (I have no idea how this word translate in english), and is hard to access )<br /><br />So if you want to be &quot;confortable&quot; get a real adapter and forget about Gyromite. The Gyromite game is absolutely terrible by the way, so at least you don't feel bad to destroy it ^^

Famicom games won't really fit in there otherwise.<br /><br />As an adapter though I think it's good, and the board is accessible so it's easy to modify. I added an extra wire for the audio expansions.

I actually have an NES with the top permanently unscrewed, which I use more often than the other one that's in better shape and hasn't been opened.
