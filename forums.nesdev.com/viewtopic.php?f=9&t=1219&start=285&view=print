<br />
<br />From what kevtris has discussed in #nesdev, it sounds like it'll end up working as follows:
<br /><ul><li> Use the 2 spare pins to select one of 9 valid region settings (each pin can either be GND, VCC, or the PIC's data output signal).</li><li> The first N settings will hardwire the PIC to a specific region.</li><li> The last setting will put the PIC in auto-detect mode.</li><li> When in auto-detect mode, the PIC will switch regions whenever it receives a set number of I/O errors (with only one I/O error detected per reset)</li><li> Once the correct region is found, it is stored in EEPROM until another I/O error is tripped.</li></ul>
<br />
<br />Whether or not it ends up being implemented like that is up to kevtris.

<br />
<br />It stores the current region # in EEPROM.
<br />
<br />The only way it will store a new region # is if it works for more than 100 or so frames (a few seconds).  If it didn't get this far, it won't save the new region #
<br />
<br />So yeah if the user powers off, cleans, re-inserts, it will not change regions since last time the cart worked.

<br />
<br />It won't save the new region until it's successful for a period of time. If your cart connector is dirty and you're adjusting the cart, you'll likely be <em>turning off</em> the NES while adjusting the cart, which will cause it to retry the last successful region each time you turn it back on. On the other hand, if it's failing due to the wrong region, you'll just be hitting the reset button and waiting a few seconds to see if it runs.
<br />
<br />At least that's how I understand it.

<br />
<br />Yeah as Q said, the current region number is stored in a RAM location.  The EEPROM is on-chip also, so there are no other chips or parts needed to make this thing work.
<br />
<br />You just drop this 8 pin chip on a board and hook it up to the lockout pins and to power, and away you go.  There are no other parts required for operation other than a bypass cap across the power pins (which all chips need anyways).
<br />
<br />The EEPROM is good for 1 million or more writes, so writing it once when a successful region is found that differs from the stored one will be few and far between.  There probably won't be more than 10 writes to it during its lifetime.

The only problem if that if the region fail and the power is off then on again, the chip will try the same region over and over, and most people will do that when carts aren't working (regardless of if it's due to dirty connector or invalid region, since both will result in a flickering NES, heh).

<br />a) Write in the manual for the game how the end-users should operate the cartridge.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think I know a good way to use the two remaining pins on the lockout clone.  Have them serve as a status indicator of the chip, so that the ROM (through a specially mapped register) can see whether or not the current region selection is valid.  The idea would be something like this:
<br />
<br />Both outputs should start out set to zero.  The chip will set the first output to 1 right after the master CIC releases the reset condition.  If the first seed transaction fails, no other changes will be made to the outputs until the next reset.  At that time, the chip should clear both outputs until the reset condition is gone, then set the second output to 1.  On a subsequent reset, the chip will revert to setting the first output to 1, and so on.
<br />
<br />Once a successful seed transaction takes place, the chip should set both outputs to 1.  This will remain the setting of the outputs until either (1) the chip is reset or (2) a transaction fails.  At that time, behavior should revert to the one described above.
<br />
<br />A specially mapped register would be accessible to the PRG-ROM code.  On startup, it will check the status of these two bits, and if both are set assume all is well and continue normally.  If one bit is set and the other clear, then display a message indicating to the user that the NES should be reset to initialize the cartridge hardware.  By keeping track of which of the two bits was set, a game could determine how many times Reset was pressed, and if the count exceeds the number of known regions, a message will inform the user that initialization has failed and that he needs to power off and reinsert the cartridge.
<br />
<br />If neither bit is set when the register is polled, then the lockout clone must not be functioning at all.  A faulty connection error could then be displayed on the screen.
<br />
<br />Mapper hardware can be initialized from these two outputs by taking advantage of the fact that both bits become zero temporarily upon reset.  Perform an OR operation between the two outputs, and initialize the hardware on a rising edge of the result.
<br />
<br />Obviously, special mapper hardware is necessary to take advantage of these two outputs.  I figure, however, that chip will most likely be used on a custom-built cartridge rather that an existing one (which will already have a CIC), so it shouldn't be too hard to design the custom hardware to make use of these outputs.

<br />Edit: oops, I just realized thats exactly what you implied above. oh well.
<br />
<br />Also I think the conclusion was that one pin will be a mapper reset output and the other may be the same thing inverted, and i believe your custom cart could use one of those to basically determine the same thing, whether the cic is failing or passing its transation checks.
