Thanks tepples.<br /><br />After placing my test ROM on a plain cart I've verified that this has nothing to do with the PowerPak, the behaviour was the same.<br /><br />After removing the CopyNES and placing my 2A03 CPU directly into the socketed motherboard, my NES now retains RAM on reset. Success!<br /><br />So... what is the CopyNES doing on reset? I thought it was supposed to be entirely transparent if it wasn't plugged in via USB.<br /><br /><br />Edit: apparently it does indeed run code on reset by design, and there's a RAM wipe in there. So... question answered. So there is in fact at least one way that a CopyNES modded NES differs from a stock NES! Reset and power both put RAM in a consistent state, whether or not the cable is plugged in.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Fri Mar 28, 2014 8:43 am</p><hr />

<em>Edit: the cause has been identified, see below.</em><br /><br />Yes, I'm well aware that some games expect RAM retention. What I want to know is whether this has happened for anyone else. How common is the problem? Can I identify and eliminate a single factor which is causing it?<br /><br />The first two things I will try eliminating are the PowerPak (about to solder up a plain cartridge to test), and the CopyNES (will try removing this next). As I said in my post, the pattern that appeared in RAM after reset appeared to be consistent, so I strongly suspect code is running.<br /><br />1. Can anyone test the ROM I posted with a PowerPak + NES? Is your result different than mine?<br />2. Can anyone test the ROM I posted on an NES with CopyNES? Is your result different than mine?<br /><br />Does anyone know if a disconnected CopyNES is capable of running code at reset?<br /><br />Could a disconnected CIC pin 4 cause a problem like this?<br /><br />It could just be something unreliable about my NES' old hardware too, that's another reason I'm wondering if this happens to other people. If this happens to some minority of NES machines, it's something that could easily go undetected. (I have a small collection of games, maybe about 20, and I couldn't identify any that retained anything on reset, not even a high score table.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Fri Mar 28, 2014 6:59 am</p><hr />

The PowerPak is no good for power-on tests because the NES transitions from power-up state to running state while the PowerPak menu is displayed. But the menu runs at all only after a cold boot or a long reset; a short press of the reset button should put your program in warm reset state. And because it has the same effects on PPU ports $2003-$2007 as a cold boot (namely no access to video memory for one frame, and problems with a pair of sprites until a frame is fully rendered), you can even use it as a proxy for some cold boot effects.<br /><br />Only two things can change data in an SRAM: power loss and pulling /CE and /WE low. I think what they're trying to say is that if noise is on the CPU bus during a reset, the address decoder might see the noise and end up pulling /CE low, and /WE might likewise end up pulled low.<br /><br />Caution for using SMB1: The SMB1+Duck Hunt multicart does <em>not</em> preserve values across reset.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Mar 28, 2014 5:50 am</p><hr />

I want to know whether other NES machines do the same thing, or if this is specific to my NES (possibly because of the <s>use of either PowerPak or</s> the installed CopyNES). Does it happen only in some cases, and is it generally reliable outside of those cases? Are there revisions that have different behaviour here?<br /><br />Emulators appear to universally retain RAM at reset, and in my tests this behaviour agrees with my Famicom at least.<br /><br />Can you test your own hardware? (What do you mean you don't have to test it?) Your theoretical ideas don't help my problem, unless you can suggest a new approach to test.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Thu Mar 27, 2014 10:32 pm</p><hr />

I don't have to test it. The RAM in the NES is static RAM. Dynamic loses it's state without being refresh, nothing erases static RAM. It does not degrade from not being read, as long as the chip has power, the only thing that can kill should be the fluctuating bus. Which is probably what you are seeing, the other system might have hardware to avoid those problems, while the NES does not. The only RAM on the system that degrades if held in reset are sprites and palette data and PPU register data probably. That all needs read and re-written to keep it fresh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Thu Mar 27, 2014 10:17 pm</p><hr />

Any location that might be suspect on a floating bus. That means basically any value, really, since floating pins just float. That's basically it. Maybe the other CPU.

It should over reset, it doesn't use DRAM for main RAM and nametable RAM.
