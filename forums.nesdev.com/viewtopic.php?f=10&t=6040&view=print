		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Until recently, I had no idea that people were still making games for the great consoles/computers of yesteryear. I want in!
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, I have no programming knowledge whatsoever, only the desire to produce retro-styled video games. I have done some research on game development, but I'm still not sure just where to begin.
<br />
<br />That being said, I have a few questions for those in the know:
<br />
<br />-What console would be best to start out on?
<br />
<br />-What programming language should I learn first?
<br />
<br />-What tools will I need?
<br />
<br />-What do I really need to know to make a video game?
<br />
<br />Any information will be of much help, and greatly appreciated!

<br />A basic understanding of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry" class="postlink">analytic geometry</a> helps immensely, as the concept of a pixel grid derives from it.

Do you like math (or at least don't hate it)? I guess you at least have to be inclined to technical stuff, otherwise it will be really hard to grasp the concepts of console programming.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">-What console would be best to start out on?</div><br />Starting straight with consoles might be a bit hardcore, it sure is much easier to learn game programming concepts on a PC. When you start learning about a console from the ground it can easily take you months, or even over a year to make something meaningful, like a controllable character.<br /><br />However one thing that might be worth recommending is <a href="http://www.atariage.com/forums/forum/65-batari-basic/" class="postlink">batari Basic</a>. It's a BASIC-like language that can be used to make Atari 2600 games. It abstracts from the programmer all the complicated stuff about rendering graphics so you can quickly make something playable. And there are lots of sources from other people's projects that you can study.<br /><br />It's of course a limited tool, and it's not possible to make games as complex as the ones made directly in assembly language. But the good thing is that even though you'll not be messing directly with the lower-level details of the console, hopefully you'll learn something about them. And the 2600 uses the same CPU as the NES, so what you learn from it might even be useful for NES development in the future.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">-What programming language should I learn first?</div><br />Most old consoles are programmed in assembly, and each CPU has it's own assembly language (even though they all share some concepts they're still different languages). The NES uses a CPU that was also used in several other machines (such as the Atari 2600, Commodore 64, TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine...), the 6502. The Z80 is another very common CPU, it was used on the Sega Master System, Game Boy/GBC, ZX Spectrum, MSX... These 2 CPUs were probably the most used ones in the 80's, so it would be a good idea to look them up.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">-What tools will I need?</div><br />Basically an assembler for the CPU of your choice, but you'll soon need tools to draw graphics. Once you decide the machine you want to work with you can look for these specific tools.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">-What do I really need to know to make a video game?</div>
<br />You need to know some math, the hexadecimal and binary numeral systems, and analytic geometry (like tepples mentioned) should help you with the graphics side of things. That's enough to get started.

<br />
<br />I'm with Tepples on the recommendation to start out with Python programming. It's a really nice high-level language, and you'll benefit immensely from learning it when you get to the point of needing to make tools for NES coding.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, this does not mean you will have to postpone learning to code 6502 on the NES. Memblers is a good example of someone who started learning 6502 on the NES as his first programming language ever. (and had he not, maybe we wouldn't be writing you these messages right now)
<br />
<br />My recommendation is to tackle this journey from two ends: use Python to learn about programming in general, and 6502+NES to learn about low-level hardware-oriented programming. In reality, these are two rather separate fields of software engineering. But at the same time, you'll sooner or later need to start thinking about how to apply what you learn from high-level software development to NES development in order to write maintainable code.
<br />
<br />What I would not recommend you though, is learning C/C++. This could very roughly be described as sitting right in the middle of an imaginary bar with Python on one end and 6502 on the other. While it's compromise between high-level and low-level programming has made it very successful in lots of areas (game programming for one), I reckon it'll be the worst of both worlds in your case. 
<br />
<br />If you'll get to the point of having a good understanding of both low-level AND high-level programming, then you will automatically see the use (and misuse) of C/C++ when you encounter it. But for now, keep these two fields of studies (high-level vs low-level programming) separated, but enjoy the learning experience from both,

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh, and I also forgot to mention that Lua could be a good alternative here if your goal of learning programming is specifically learning to program the NES. The reason is that Lua scripting has been added to FCEU, one of the more popular NES emulators used for development. And using it to extend your NES code is a good way to add interactive debug and level editing possibilities to your NES game. And it's very fun, too. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />On the other hand, I personally consider Lua to be highly inferior to Python (though someone may differ), and actually wish that Python support had been added to FCEU instead. So which one you choose would depend on personal preference and priorities. And nothing but lack of spare time keeps you from learning both...
