It used a rotary sequence. If you figured out the length of the sequence, you could 'cheat' (that was really the intended solution), but it also had a trick up its sleeve the next time you would face it: if you had won all rounds up until the last, it would also 'cheat' by resetting its sequence to frame 0.

It's dumb, but not dumb enough to fall for the &quot;always play X&quot; strategies.<br /><br />For the Lizard Sbock variant you might try &quot;Randomly choose 2 past opponent moves, and play to beat both&quot;.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Sbock makes no sense. Maybe I need a sense of humor.</div><br /><br />Ok, well, there was a week left in the competition, and I wanted to do 2 entries. For some reason, I thought it would give me an advantage if I did a second entry. Of the 10 ideas I had, only this and a mini-piano simulator could be done in a week, and I thought this would be more fun.<br /><br />So, you get how Rock Paper Scissors works. Right? You try to guess what your opponent will choose and you choose the option that will defeat that move...but, people who play this game competitively tend to follow set patterns. Guessing those patterns is fairly easy, making the game tend to have lots of 'ties'...thus, not so fun. (according to someone, about 60-70% of each throw ended in a tie)<br /><br />By adding 2 more choices, only 20% of the throws end in a tie, and with 5 choices, it is much more difficult to guess what you opponent will choose next. Making it more interesting.<br /><br />Anyway, I thought people might have fun trying to guess what the computer was going to do next. There are hidden patterns.<br /><br />It was also featured in 'Big Bang Theory'...and I thought, would appeal to fans of that show. I see about a <s>dozen</s> 40 apps in the app store of this game, so...it seemed like people were interested.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The fun of rock paper scissors can come from the natural tendency of humans to repeat patterns and the ease of seeing such patterns on opponent's behaviour. A typical human-vs-human rock paper scissor rapidly make you think &quot;I know that he will want to go paper next, I should play scissors, but he's possibly aware of that I may play paper or rock to be sure ...&quot; And that's good, for some lecture: David Sirlin theorized a lot on that.<br /><br />With more options patterns become harder to see and control, we tend to just throw guesses as &quot;random&quot; without thinking too much. This explain the low numbers of ties, but it rapidly becomes as fun as rolling a dice. It could still be fun against an human based of emotions/reactions, but is rapidly boring against a computer that we naturally suspect to be completely random. Against that suspicion of random, maybe a difficulty level could be something great with easiest using super simple patterns, hardest being practically random.<br /><br />An other point that can help your game is another background. That's personal, but the full black all the time do not help me not to sleep.<br /><br />Anyway, for the good points, the game enjoyed me from the begining: seeing the title made me smile (I was not aware that the game existed prior to that.) And I loved the descriptions of action shown at the bottom &quot;paper disproves Sbock&quot; was excellent!
