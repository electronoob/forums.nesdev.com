<br />I have written several VCS games myself, so I could possibly help understanding concepts from that source code.

<br />
<br />I don't think this is your case, though (and a vine will look worse than a rope when flickering). There aren't many sprites on the screen (meaning you can use a good deal of them for the vine), and since the vine is mainly vertical, you won't get any flickering from sprite cycling.
<br />
<br />As for how you arrange the tiles, the easiest way would be to use circles, but that looks kinda odd for a vine. I guess that having a few line patterns in different angles would make the best impression. The vines in <em>Sonic 3</em> on the Megadrive/Genesis looks pretty good. I don't remember exactly how they do it, though...

<br />Donkey Kong Country does everything with sprites, but the SNES has a lot more sprites than the NES has.
<br />I think use several different tiles with different angles can look more or less good in function of how you use them (I think the clocks in the second level of CastleVania III looks wrong).
<br />
<br />Doing it in BG may seem harder, but it seems like a quite interesting technical challenge, and that is fun too.

<br />Nah... waaay too much trouble for that. If the background (behind the vine) was completely empty, I guess it would be an option. But since the vine waves in front of the trees, it would be too complicated, would use a lot of tiles (since you have to account for different part being overlaped) and would be hard to update on the name table (because of the irregular shape).

<br />that screen actually is one, but i used it as an example anyways.

<br />I was looking at some 2600 screenshots of Pitfall, and the vines don't start from the top of the screen as I thought they did (you probably know that, 'cause you're the one doing the port and you must have studied the original a lot!). That means that the area covered by the vines is actually pretty small, so I believe it can be represented with few sprites. I guess it would be at most some 48 pixels tall, wich would need only 6 8x8 sprites (making the vines out of 8x16 sprites would be more complicated, IMO), and that's not much at all.
<br />
<br />If you make them somewhat "pixelated", as they used to be on the 2600, you could have 4x4 "pixels" within each tile, and just a few patterns such as these:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">...o&nbsp; ...o&nbsp; ..o.&nbsp; ..o.&nbsp; .o..&nbsp; o...&nbsp; o...<br />..o.&nbsp; ..o.&nbsp; ..o.&nbsp; ..o.&nbsp; .o..&nbsp; .o..&nbsp; .o..<br />.o..&nbsp; .o..&nbsp; .o..&nbsp; ..o.&nbsp; ..o.&nbsp; ..o.&nbsp; ..o.<br />o...&nbsp; .o..&nbsp; .o..&nbsp; ..o.&nbsp; ..o.&nbsp; ..o.&nbsp; ...o</div>
<br />could be enough to make all the needed angles. One half could even use the same patterns as the other, and just flip the sprites when needed. So I guess only 4 patterns is enough.
<br />
<br />I don't know how you'd code this animation, though. I can't think of any logic that would define the correct tiles to use for each section, and how much to displace them in relation to the previous section based on the angle, so maybe this animation will have to be hard-coded... Or maybe you could have some sort of line drawing algorithm, so as you calculate the "ideal" line with it, you check how much the line dislocates within each section (4 "pixels") and you can pick the appropriate tile to use there, one that displaced just as many pixels. Just an idea.

<br />
<br />i have a variable that contains the frame index into the animation and the direction. the data for the animation is just an array of Y,T,A, and X values for each sprite of each frame.  there are five in all which are then mirrored to go the other way. seeing how i have an abundance of prg-rom, storing  5 frames of data rather than calculating it wasn't a problem.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You could go the semi-lazy route and just keep the same tile for every sprite, that being a completely straight vertical line. It'd look a little terrible, but not SO terrible. You can have some predefined path for the rope, like this:
<br />
<br />swing:
<br />.db $01,$08,$02,$07,$03,$06,$04,$05,$05,$04,$06,$03,$07,$02,$08,$01
<br />;This is for the first half of the rope swing
<br />
<br />Where each byte alternates between x and y pos additions for 1 sprite. At the beggining, it adds 1 to the X pos, and 8 to the Y pos to get the first frame of animation. Then it adds 2 to the X pos, and 7 to the Y pos for the next, and eventually you'll either have to have a routine that subtracts these values instead of adding them for the second half of the rope swing, or you'll have to add like $FE to the Y pos to get the same result as -2 to the Y pos. And for every sprite going up the rope, subtract an animation from each end. It's just an idea I whipped up. If you don't understand, and you want to understand, I can try explain it in different words if you'd like.
