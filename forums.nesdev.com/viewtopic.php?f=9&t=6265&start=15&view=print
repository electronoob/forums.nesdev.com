<br />you will be there forever trying to desolder the double sided pcb on the toaster nes.
<br />
<br />I have done many rgb mods and repairs with the heat gun.
<br />
<br />i put my pcb in a vice with the chip facing down.
<br />
<br />i then heat the back side of ic the moving the heat gun along the path
<br />of the pins. 
<br />
<br />don't go too slow or you will never heat up everything enough before burning the pcb.
<br />
<br />I normally slide a real thin wire under the ic and tug on it lightly to help the chip out.
<br />
<br />You can always shield part of the pcb a little with some foil to avoid over heating other spots. 
<br />
<br />After you are all done you can use solder wick to clean out the holes if needed.

You have to push down this pump thing so it clicks in, then you just push this button on the side so it releases the pump and it causes a split second of suction. So yeah, you have the iron coming in contact with the solder so it's hot/melted, then you really quick put the solder sucker over the melted solder and push the button. It works surprisingly well for looking like such a piece of crap. I think it was like $7.

<br />
<br />Desoldering braid was probably the first thing I ever touched with a soldering iron, I'm pretty sure it would have worked much better if I had known at the time to add just a little more solder.  It was a UNROM cart I wanted to modify, the problem was that the ROM pins' solder joints were almost flat, it's the bare minimum of solder in there.  So there was really poor heat transfer, the braid could only suck part it up because the solder wasn't hot enough to flow on both sides of the board (thus compounding the problem).  But yeah I'm sure it would work good if used right, me personally messing around with stuff on my own I used up the whole roll by the time I knew how to use the stuff properly, heheh.  The cart had 'battle damage', but it worked and I used it a lot.

My later attempts went much better.

<br />
<br />Thanks for the tip, I picked up a couple of those.  They look brand new.
<br />
<br />That makes me curious if they changed anything in the H revision, I had heard the original (no letter) revision had stronger outputs, so it could drive more chips.  That could mean the common G revision wouldn't be as good of a replacement for the VS board.
<br />
<br />I already traded one of H revisions for an original revision one, now that I have a VS board too (no adapter to run it with yet) maybe I'll find something out.  The parts on this VS board are dated 1984 and 1983, it's pretty old.  One of the original AA batteries on had tested at 1.56V !  The other one had leaked.

<br />
<br />Memblers, you said you picked up a couple 2A03's. Would you consider selling me one? Realistically you should be able to ship it via lettermail, making it probably cost around $2 at most. I consider $7-10 a much more reasonable price. 
<br />
<br />
<br />I'm also still looking for the NES PPU if anyone knows where I could possibly find that.

<br />
<br />It's much faster and cleaner than the desoldering irons, and you won't burn the logic board.

<br />What are the part numbers on the components in your Famicom clone?

<br />
<br />Yeah, I paid $17 for those 2 chips, that sure beats $20 for one.  I would have ordered more if they had them, as I recently received a bunch of NES's (minus CPU), which may be great for some compatibility tests between some board revisions.  Unfortunately though both of those are already traded away to see what's different about the H revision, so I'll be back to just having the one in my toploader.  I could have some 2A03Gs left over, $10 would be alright.  It will be a little while since I have some other stuff going on.
<br />
<br />I'll definitely have some extra PPUs.

<br />I would like as much advice as possible.  I have an open wallet for supplies and such.
<br />
<br />Im pretty worried about the procedure since i have little to no desoldering experience.  I do however grasp skills quickly.  My first soldering job was soldering a modchip into my xbox. 
<br />
<br />I have been praticing with circuit boards i have laying around the house in desoldering similar sized ICs 
<br />
<br />I tried using a 15 watt radioshack pencil and it was worthless  Just would not melt the solder even if i held it there for 20 seconds.  i changed to a brand new 30 watt radioshack and it was slightly less worthless.  i hold it on the pin and it would take 10 seconds to melt the solder.  The tip was laughably solder repellant and couldent be tinned with either my 60-40 solder or with my low melting silver bearing solder.  also even no fresh solder did not melt on immediate contact.  They both seemed to have poor heat conductance.  
<br />
<br />I changed to a 23 watt weller thats been rather mistreated.
<br />I cleaned the tip  and re tinned it.
<br />
<br />worked much better  using a spring vaccume pump it sucked much of the solder of the pin however the pins still stick to the board.  i used a prod tool underneath the ic and slowly tilted it cracking the small bits of solder.  i wasent being rough.
<br />
<br />i played with it and eventually sucessfully got the IC off the board
<br />
<br />it wasnt a bad task however it was just a single sided board   relitively easy
<br />
<br />Now i was considering getting something a little more professional 
<br />
<br />would you recomend a radioshack desoldering iron?
<br />The heated one with the rubber ball on the end? 
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2062731">http://www.radioshack.com/product/index ... Id=2062731</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Its 45 watt however wattage does not necessarely mean its hotter since the entire assembly is much larger  metal it would have a lower tempeture then a 45 watt pencil iron with a normal tip
<br />
<br />i am running out of things to remove ICs from
<br />
<br />But i still have my copy of castlequest...
<br />
<br />i saw the desoldering station in the earlier post and i would like to know what tempture you have it set at when working.  im considering picking it up.  does it have an ACTUAL vaccume on it (for on off suction) or is it a one time click and suck like a spring pump kind. 
<br />
<br />Thank you for your tips
<br />
<br />The machine im working on is the one my parents gave me 20 years ago when i went to kindergarden so its important to me.

<br />It has a built in solder sucker. So far I've found it slightly more efficient than the RadioShack one (which is also very good, but mine isn't working very well anymore). Holding it in way that you can push the button is a little awkward, but so is pressing and releasing the rubber ball on the other one.
