This meant the change would be wrong in some cases, so things that use the result (cameraposition) after this point might also be wrong because of bad input.<br /><br />Provided the output for the compare with 128 is now correct, you'd be checking a step beyond the carry. That is that the branch you take and don't take based on the state of the carry after the compare outputs the right values for cameraposition.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Ok so I'm confused now <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> My problem is that I don't know how to verify this</div><br />There are just two possible caes for this first check. 1. That ladyposition &lt; 127, in which case cameraposition should be zero. 2. That ladyposition is &gt;=128 in which case cameraposition should be ladyposition-128.<br /><br />Just looking at RAM is probably good enough in this case. Move the character. When the character is at a position between 0 and 127, is cameraposition 0? When the character is at a position from 128 to 65535, is cameraposition that value-128? If so, that's all you need.<br /><br />To verify in general, you think about the possible cases. For the compare with 128, it branches and does something, or it doesn't branch and does something else. You make sure the &quot;something&quot; and &quot;something else&quot; it does for your input are correct (give you the output from your chart. The value you expect) when you run the program.<br /><br />If you check the RAM where she's below 127 and it's always zero, and when she's above, it's always the position -128 it's probably fine. You don't have to check the full range of values between 0 and 65535. You can check just a few from both cases (below and above 128), and if you see no problems with the logic of the code itself, nor problems while running the code you've done enough.<br /><br />Edit: The hope with doing the checks at all is that you check just enough in practice to catch cases that exist that you did not think about. The old compare 128 works most of the time, looks good on paper if you're not so familiar with 16 bit stuff. But if you ran it and walked the lady a full screen to the right, it would start to do some wrong things, which you could then fix. If you don't check (or barely check) before you add more code, when something goes wrong there's a lot more to look at. Which is the difference between, &quot;There's a problem in these 80 lines of code and I don't know what it is,&quot; and &quot;There's a problem in these 20 lines and it's because the state of the carry is wrong here.&quot; You may not know WHY it's wrong, but that's cool and easier to help with.

How is my camera susposed to ever go anywhere?</div><br />It should subtract 128 from the character's position, not the camera's position. It should then use this value (character's position-128) as the camera's position. It would go somewhere besides zero when the character's position is greater than 128. (Because at this point character's position-128 is greater than 0).<br /><br />edit2: Another thing that may be getting in your way. The value of camera position before this code is run absolutely doesn't matter. It will be set correctly if the character's position is correct. This is why you do first piece math with character position and set camera position based on this. The rest of the code is focused on fixing the new value for camera position if it's wrong (out of bounds). Which is the point of the questions.<br /><br />edit:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">maybe I should combine question0 and question2?</div><br />That's probably the best way. A subtract is a compare. If you subtract 128 from the character's position to get the camera's position, the carry will tell you if it was below zero, in which case you can set it to zero, otherwise it's right. That's how the code I posted works. <br /><br />If you wait (long enough for the carry to change), you have to rely on if the high byte of camera position is negative to check for below zero. A negative high byte doesn't necessarily mean it got that way because it was below zero, it could simply be a large unsigned number. (Although that only matters if you have a level greater than 32768 pixels, which you probably won't. But it's still good practice to check for below zero directly after a subtract.)

If you don't know what you want, the computer sure won't know either. So think it over more.<br /><br />You want something. The output is the values you want. You design code to give you what you want, so it should... actually give you that. Verifying is just making sure what you get with the code is actually what you want. If it isn't, you find out why and fix it.<br /><br />1. If you want your character to accelerate by two every frame, the output is two plus the input. To verify, you make sure that's what you're getting. <br /><br />2. If you want a way to tell if two objects are colliding, that's what you want. The output is true if they are, and false if they aren't. Verifying is checking that the code you wrote works in all the cases they're colliding.<br /><br />Basically if you know what you want, you know what the output should be. The hard part is designing code to give it to you, not knowing what you want.<br /><br />Now, what you need to verify and what you want isn't necessarily a static thing. For instance, 1 above. You figured that's what you wanted. Then you actually do it, and realize wait! You want a max speed of 16 too! So then what you want changes, and the output chart changes slightly with it.<br /><br />0:2<br />1:3<br />2:4<br />etc.<br />16:16<br />17:16<br />18:16<br />19:16 <br />(etc)<br /><br />Sometimes by trying (and even succeeding) in getting what you want, you realize there are still some cases in that you don't want. And then you fix those.<br /><br />Granted, that's a fairly simple example. But even if you want a complex thing, you need to be able to break what you want into values. If you can't, you're not yet ready to tell the computer how to give you what you want because all it understands IS values. You don't even necessarily need to create a chart every time (keep it in your head), but if you find yourself REALLY stumped, it can be helpful to make one.
