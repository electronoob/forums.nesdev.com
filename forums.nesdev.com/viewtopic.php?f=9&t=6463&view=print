<br />
<br />I seem to remember seeing a picture out there of a pirate cart that did everything in TTL, is there anymore information on that out there? Schematics of the substitution, etc etc?

If you want the full mapper it'll be about 20 chips... Not the brightest thing to build... Also do you know that your game makes full use of the mapper? It could be smarter to port it to something else.

<br />Unless the game has tricky protection against modification, such as Earthbound Prototype (crashes on <a href="http://forum.starmen.net/forum/Games/Mother1/EB0-Piracy-Screen" class="postlink">copyright warning screen</a> halfway through the game), Bucky O'Hare (locks to hardest difficulty), HKO Earthworm Jim 2 (doesn't boot because its init code constructs a jump table in RAM based on hashes of ROM), or <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3030/keeping_the_pirates_at_bay.php" class="postlink">Spyro: Year of the Dragon</a> on the PS1 (doesn't spawn enough plot coupons to get the game to progress).

<br />
<br />Actually I have decided on using Verilog for my next NES board, and I have to say it's a really easy language to use.  So if you already know digital logic and can draw out a truth table of what you want, taking the step into Verilog is definitely advisable.
<br />
<br />I've seen some of those pirate boards, just filled up with 74LS chips.  That 74HC670 sounds pretty nice though, they seem to be in stock at Mouser and other places at the usual 74HCxx price range.

<br />When did it go back into production? Does anyone know?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A chip fab or two must still make them to meet a VERY small demand. NXP seems to have made them recently as Digikey has stock of HC670 and HCT670 in SSOP packages. I think if you have a big enough order (in the thousands) you can still get them made.
<br />
<br />As for CPLD, many thousands of mapper-suitable Xilinx 95144XL and Coolrunner 1 available for &lt;$6 and will only require a 3.3V regulator. Newer Coolrunner 2 are still being made but they will require TWO regulators and series resistors on all inputs. Lattice MachXO seem to still be made but will require a 3.3V regulator. Altera EPM240 are available (not sure if being made), and will require at least a 3.3V regulator, perhaps series resistors too.
