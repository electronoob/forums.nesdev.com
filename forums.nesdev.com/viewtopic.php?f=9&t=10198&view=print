		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In #nesdev, bunnyboy asked how to test the video lag of an HDTV showing an NES picture. Someone suggested rigging a photosensor to the controller port and using the NES to count the time. So I wrote an NES program that measures time-to-light in milliseconds using the photosensor in a Zapper. It works on a CRT, where I get the expected sub-15 ms depending on how low it's pointed. My cousin reported being able to get the test screens in Zap Ruder to see his 6-month-old LCD HDTV, not the position on the TV but at least the fact that it's pointed at the TV. But I can't get the Zapper to see my (older) LCD HDTV's backlight at all. Perhaps his TV's backlight somehow gets past the demodulator in the Zapper; it might be a difference between CCFL and LED backlights.<br /><br />Someone else would have to rig up a different photosensor circuit that sees any light source. Ideas?

	</div><br />It's an utterly stupid schematic, and can easily be railed. But it involves very minimal parts. I used a three AAs, two 2N3704s, a red LED, and my headphones. (LEDs can be used as photodiodes, hence why I've marked one, since I have tons of LEDs lying around. If you have a real photodiode, or a phototransistor, you could use it instead)<br />Better designs would use op amps and high-pass filters to make it more robust.<br />After, you could replace the speaker with a resistor and connect that to one of the NES's input pins.

But I see the same (lack of) response with the 1-gun Y on-off zapkernel of <a href="http://pineight.com/nes/#ruder" class="postlink">Zap Ruder</a>, which reports how long it takes for the sensor to turn on (go high voltage, or low logic level after running through the controller port's inverter) and then how long to turn off. I point it at my CRT TV and it works wonderfully. I point it at an LCD, no dice.<br /><br />Anyone willing to solder together this photodiode circuit, test it, and ship it to a U.S. address may be eligible for a reward. PM me.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the video. It's a 1/20 slow motion shot of an &quot;LCD&quot; monitor (probably a CCFL-lit LCD) followed by an &quot;LED&quot; monitor (probably an LED-lit LCD). The &quot;LCD&quot; doesn't flicker; instead, it quickly fades from one frame to the next. The &quot;LED&quot; flickers noticeably. Perhaps the reason why the Zapper can see my six-year-old TV but not my cousin's six-month-old TV is that mine is probably a CCFL-lit LCD and his may be LED-lit. Or is there a difference between the gray Zapper and the later red Zapper that might have the latter to have less filtering?

I got my red zapper to trigger reliably on light sources from 4kHz to 64kHz, and I strongly suspect it would go wider.
