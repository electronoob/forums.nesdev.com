I simply haven't had the time/energy to look into these issues, plus I lack most of the actual technical knowledge that would probably be required to fix most of these problems. If anybody actually fixes any of the issues in it though, I'd be more than happy to incorporate the fixes to the repository.<br /><br />The visual nes may be useful to trace signals and try to understand some of the master clock level timing, but anything that comes out of it should also be validated on an actual NES before making any conclusions.

What hardware is it supposed to run on, and are you requesting a test of that ROM?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For now, it simply draws triangle tiles from the first nametable on the first row of tiles. At around scanline 1, dot 256 it does a second write to 2006 and draws from the second nametable instead. If t-&gt;v happened too early, the triangles will start shaking as some writes will happen before dot 256.<br /><br />...Yes, this is very much a prototype... haha. Anyway, it's currently tuned to be 1 cpu cycle too early in nintendulator, thereby causing shaking. At this point, I should see how other emulators react. I'll also go back to bart vs the space mutants (shakes in nintendulator) and check if the write timings there are similar to the current test.<br />A real nes should have a delayed t-&gt;v transfer and not have any shaking, so if someone feel like giving the current version a try it can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/FredYeye/2nd2006" class="postlink">https://github.com/FredYeye/2nd2006</a> (2nd2006_simple.nes).<br /><br />As stated in the git readme, the timing variance is too big too determine the exact t-&gt;v delay, but it should in theory not shake on a real nes. I don't know if this is true for all cpu-ppu alignments.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">And yes, I didn't ask for HW tests earlier because it was even more prototype back then, haha.</span>

Borrowed the nmi sync loop from blargg and tinkered some with it. Currently the 2006 write instruction starts at either dot 250 or 252, alternating between the two. I'll see if I can easily adjust it tomorrow.<br /><br />Edit2: The variance is down to 1 dot. Pretty good! Let's see what's next...<br /><br />Edit3: It's now possible to toggle scanlines and dots for precise writes. Here's a cheat sheet for what cycles sta $2006 starts on in nintendulator.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">y,x<br />dot,dot+1<br />y= toggle scanline (up/down)<br />x= toggle dot*3 (left/right)<br /><br />0,0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0,1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0,2<br />240,241&nbsp; 243,244&nbsp; 246,247<br /><br />1,0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,2<br />241,242&nbsp; 244,245&nbsp; 247,248<br /><br />2,0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,2<br />242,243&nbsp; 245,246&nbsp; 248,249</div><br /><br />I guess there's still some things to do, like setting up a known start point. Right now it just wings it and works in nintendulator, unsure if alignment makes a difference.<br />Also the graphics output, which was already cryptic, makes no sense right now since it doesn't take changing scanlines into account.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's a limitation of the test I believe - every offset writes at dot X, and then X+1 the next frame (then X, X+1 etc). So if dot X is before the Y inc and dot X+1 is after, it should be flickering. There should only be one offset with flickering, at least as far as I know.<br /><br />For reference, here's one possible broken triangle, which means that t-&gt;v happened before the Y inc:<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KuAzfn0.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />A perfect staircase triangle, which means that t-&gt;v happened after the Y inc:<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/WTtM5fQ.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />(I'll change the triangle to have one color since it means nothing, btw.)<br /><br />The only way to know on which offsets it should be before, after or flickering is to compare against hardware. It *should* work on hardware, but I still want to add some init code to make the setup consistent.<br />The output isn't the greatest, I know... and there's no clear pass/fail. I'll try to improve it once I know it works as intended, and see which offset does what on hardware. Different alignments might even make offsets do different things, who knows...
