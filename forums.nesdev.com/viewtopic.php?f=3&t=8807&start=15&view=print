And Blargg's tests require that the IRQs is fired at the SAME time as the FIRST edge of CHR A12 (not M2), I know because I kept failing blargg's tests until I realized I wasn't firing the IRQ until the end of the CPU's clock cycle.  So *ASSUMING* blargg's tests pass on a real MMC3 I can't see how some other filtering is possible.  <br /><br />Now for the something like the RAMBO-1 it could be filtering some other way since it's IRQ is delayed from the first edge of CHR A12.  It might be checking for more than just that first positive edge of CHR A12.<br /><br /><br /><br />Zepper: I'm guessing you aren't having the same exact issue that I did, but it's probably worth explaining the problem I had.  You NEED to fire IRQ the instant CHR A12 goes high to pass Blargg's tests.  If you wait until the CPU finishes it's current cycle to fire the IRQ or you'll fail his scanline timing tests.  Basically the CPU must get the IRQ *BEFORE* it starts it's next cycle, that way the IRQ gets handled vice the next instruction.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">crudelios wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I have read somewhere that Kevtris information is old and inaccurate.

<br />
<br />Yeah I don't want to discredit any of the great pioneering work Kevtris did early on (or is currently doing).  I greatly appreciate how his documentation is one of the few that explains things on a hardware level.  But I have found a few mix ups here and there.  With most of this stuff it's best to check around before just relying on one source of documentation.
<br />
<br />But I haven't performed these tests myself on the real MMC3 so until I get off my rear and do, take what I'm saying with a grain of salt... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />EDIT: well, it's <strong>finally</strong> working after re-reading blargg's information. However, I get the scanline timing error, of "<em>should occur sooner when $2000=$10</em>". Is this related with cycle 324 of the previous scanline???

<br />Well I don't know how much my hardware understanding will help your emulator version Zepper.  But I'm having a hard time understanding what you were saying in your last post.  Mostly what you meant by the cycle 322/323/324 differences.  
<br />
<br />Also are you comments in Blargg's code basically saying that your IRQ is getting fired one instruction too late?

<br />
<br />Anyway, here's a recap: when $2000:$18 is $08 (BG at $0000 and SP at $1000) the IRQ is working ok. For the other setting (BG at $1000 and SP at $0000), I'm adjusting the timing. Looks like the IRQ fires at PPU clock cycle 323 on scanline 1. My diagram shows that the IRQ is firing one instruction earlier <em>when the test ROM fails</em>.
<br />
<br />I'm using the test "scanline_timing.nes".

<br />
<br />How many CPU cycles are you off by?
<br />
<br />Is there a positive edge of CHR A12 on that instruction?  If you're triggering early (by a few clock cycles not scanlines)  then it sounds like you're triggering off the wrong thing.  Unless you've got some time misalignment between your PPU and CPU.  
<br />
<br />I know I've said it before but... Your IRQ MUST come in at the exact same time as CHR A12 rises (in the middle of the CPU clock cycle etc).  If you round off to the nearest CPU clock cycle you'll end up getting it late/early depending on how you round.  Round out to next and you'll be late at times, round in to beginning of CPU cycle and you'll be early.  When the CPU and PPU are aligned the IRQ should be found by the CPU on the next cycle, because it didn't get there early enough for the current cycle.

I've even whipped up simple models to test that my code is working the way it's described in all the docs I've been able to find on MMC3 IRQs. The only way I've managed to get the desired result (IRQ occurring on the scanline before it's supposed to at dot 324) is if I start the simulation at dot 256 (bypassing all the rendering clocks).
<br />
<br />With the normal behavior I get this output from my simulation:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://i1132.photobucket.com/albums/m580/beannaich/output_regular.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />With abnormal settings:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://i1132.photobucket.com/albums/m580/beannaich/output_abnormal.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />With the hack, abnormal settings still causes an IRQ at scanline 19, 39 .. 219, 239. But the normal settings start firing IRQs at scanline 20, 40 .. 220. I don't see how the IRQ is supposed to fire on an earlier scanline without some trickery.

<br />
<br />Scan line early?  norm and alt fire IRQ at the same time.  When counter == 0 AND 'allowed' posedge of CHR A12.
<br />
<br />The only thing that is different between the two is what to do if 0 is loaded into the reload register $C000.  alt will ONLY fire once after being cleared by $C001.  Norm will fire on EVERY 'allowed' posedge of CHR A12 assuming IRQs are enabled.

<br />I should have clarified. By "normal" and "abnormal" I meant:
<br />
<br />Normal: BG at $0000, SP at $1000
<br />Abnormal: BG at $1000, SP at $0000
<br />
<br />According to Disch's mapper docs, the abnormal settings cause the IRQ to fire at dot 324 of the scanline before when it's supposed to fire. Normal settings fire at dot 260.

<br />
<br />Well if you allow clocking of the counter properly (digitally filtering CHR A12) then you shouldn't have to concern yourself with background and sprite setup.  The effect of it firing early will happen naturally just like it does in the hardware.  I'm not sure how easy it is to do in an emulator but it's dead simple in hardware.  
<br />
<br />Another way to think about it is have a 'clock allow' flag that's controlled by the CPU every clock cycle. 
<br />
<br />On rising edge of CHR A12:
<br />*If 'clock allow' flag is set decrement counter
<br />*else counter unchanged
<br />
<br />Set the 'allow clock' flag:
<br />When CHR A12 has been low for ~5 *consecutive* CPU clock cycles (or 15 PPU cycles should work but that's not what the hardware senses)  If CHR A12 goes high before 5 cycles you have to start counting again from 0 (not where you were interupted by CHR A12)
<br />
<br />Clear the 'allow clock'  flag:
<br />Any time CHR A12 is high
<br />
<br />In hardware you just have a counter that is clocked by negedges of M2.  And the counter is reset asynchronously when CHR A12 is high.
