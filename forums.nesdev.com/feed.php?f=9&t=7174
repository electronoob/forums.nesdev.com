So a solution might be something like this...<br /><br />1. NES reads byte from MCU<br />2. Read triggers MCU interrupt.  MCU starts a timer, loads next output byte to a temp variable.<br />3. Timer expiration causes a second MCU interrupt; MCU copies temp variable to output.<br /><br />If a second read occurs before the timer expires, it gets an empty value.  Instead of resetting the timer, it could increment a counter to track the number of dupe reads.  Wouldn't necessarily need that value, but it would be interesting to see how often it happens.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4242">chykn</a> — Wed Nov 24, 2010 12:02 pm</p><hr />

Yes. It also happens with CHR ROM readback in $2007. The clock pulses will be at least six CPU cycles apart for legit reads or generally two for spurious reads. It's possible to have legit reads four cycles apart (e.g. <strong>ldx $4700 lda $4700</strong>), but if it's too hard to tell legit reads from spurious reads in your code, you can specify that the program always execute some other instruction between reads from your adapter's port.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Nov 24, 2010 8:35 am</p><hr />

The instructions <strong>lda $4017 lsr a</strong> take six CPU cycles (3350 ns), setting a lower bound on the time between legitimate clock pulses. The pulse from a legitimate read and the DMA unit's spurious read are noticeably more tightly spaced than that: usually a third of that (1130 ns). So after a leading edge, you can ignore further leading edges within about 2000-2500 ns. (Yes, this reminds me of what the MMC3's scanline counter does with PA12.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Tue Nov 23, 2010 9:32 am</p><hr />

Nope, DPCM basically causes at least one extra $4016/$4017 read when it occurs at the critical moment. The external device would think your code did two normal reads, unless it ignored two reads very close together. That might be doable, given the external device would probably be doing communication in software anyway.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Mon Nov 22, 2010 10:04 pm</p><hr />

When I built the NES232 I didn't know about using pins 6 &amp; 7 to input data on the controller port.  And while I'm sure you can work around issues with DPCM, I don't want to spend the time building workarounds into both the NES and MCU side of things.  On the other hand, if I get close to the end of the project and find that 795 kbit/sec is sufficient, it would be worth going back to using the controller port for external I/O.  It would certainly make the end result more attractive to folks who don't want to crack open their NES and take a soldering iron to it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Memblers wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />A parallel port for the NES, that would really be nice to have.

The digital only pins on the PIC24FJ64GB002 are 5v tolerant, but that doesn't encompass all pins used by the PMP/PSP port.  Besides, it would be safer to make everything 3.3v coming out of the EXP Port 2 just in case you accidentally hooked something up to a 3.3v only pin.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Memblers wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The way I'm saying it though would have the signals all being 5V at the connector, I guess I'm not sure what's in the circuit you have in the NES (5V-3V translation?).<br /></div><br />The EXP Port 2 board does 3 things:<br /><ul>1. Performs high byte address decoding so you can have one peripheral use the whole $4700-$47FF range or have up to 256 peripheral addresses by using the lower address byte.<br />2. Provides a transparent buffer to the data bus so that the peripheral can't communicate out of turn.<br />3. Provides 5v-&gt;3.3v level shifting on both data and control lines.</ul><br />The board is pretty simple.  It consists of a 3.3v regulator, a 74x245 for a buffer then 74x30 &amp; 74x04 chips for decoding the high address byte.  I found that using HCT chips powered at 3.3v works well.  LCX might be a better choice, but I only have HCT chips on hand at the moment.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4242">chykn</a> — Sun Nov 21, 2010 2:15 am</p><hr />

R/W and at least a couple address lines, could be re-routed to the exp port from the cartridge, then brought out to this type of parallel port connector.  I've been reluctant to designate the unused exp pins for anything yet, but something like this is definitely looking to be a good way to go.  Easy to design in, sounds like a pain to build/wire/strain-relief in a small-sized thing, but it could be worth it (thinking beyond a keyboard peripheral, heheh).<br /><br />The way I'm saying it though would have the signals all being 5V at the connector, I guess I'm not sure what's in the circuit you have in the NES (5V-3V translation?).  I didn't look at PIC24 much before now, but since PIC32 will take 5V on most of it's I/O (partly why I jumped on it), I didn't anticipate a problem (but yeah, could be for other MCUs).  I also figured I'd use CAN bus for inter-MCU communication, and NES only talks to the main one, but that has it's own advantages/disadvantages in this case.  NES addressing stuff directly should have lower latency, for one.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat Nov 20, 2010 6:03 pm</p><hr />

USB is data, data ground, power, and power ground. To oversimplify things, the difference between NES and USB is like the difference between 240p RGB video on a JAMMA plug and 1080p RGB video on a VGA plug. USB's minimum signaling rate is far too fast for the NES to process; there has to be a USB host controller in the middle.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Nov 20, 2010 10:30 am</p><hr />

It will probably work better anyway.  To help speed up peripheral development, I'm building a board to provide external connectivity.  In a nutshell you'll have a DB25 header coming out of the back of the NES.  For now I'll call it EXP port 2.<br /><br />CE goes low if the CPU is addressing the specified range.  Parts cost is around $6 or so, but then you'd have the ability to build any device with your favorite MCU and connectors from Radio Shack.  Better yet, all signal levels are already at 3.3v.  I've tested this with a PIC24F chip.  The only hard part is cutting the hole in the back of the NES and soldering either 17 or 25 lines to the motherboard.<br /><br /><ul><span style="color: yellow"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Pins for EXP port 2</span></span><br /><span style="color: red">VDD<br />VSS<br />/CE<br />R/W<br />D0-7<br />A0-7</span><span style="color: cyan"> (optional)</span></ul><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4242">chykn</a> — Fri Nov 19, 2010 7:00 pm</p><hr />
