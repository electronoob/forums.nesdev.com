You can start the kernel with a main function but it isn't necessary. The above command also works for a binary with main function.<br /><br />The explanation of this is a valid .nes file with the right offsets to load on e.g. a NES emulator.<br /><br />This should answer you question. <br /><br />About neslisp, I am still working on it. You can even load that program in ados-nes and make a lisp machine for the nes. The problem at this time of writing however is memory area overflows because of bad code without the C keyword const. If you fix this in neslisp it should work.<br /><br />Further on I want to provide some small Smalltalk kernel inside ados-nes. FYI.<br /><br />Have fun!<br />erana

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think you would benefit from building some bootable demo rom of the OS if only because source distributions are not a great way to distribute NES software. This is mostly as a result of different ways of building NES games that don't really conform to much of a standard (assembler differences, etc). For the same reason a lot of projects tend to just include the assembler and build script with the project, even though it's not great practice.

I might be wrong though, as I am really not knowledgeable about this. I've never seen the interest of an OS in embedded applications, when you can program things straight away.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, modern OS sure looks like selection menus, but in fact they of course do a lot more work in the background.<br /><br />If you remember the &quot;good old days&quot; when you had only DOS, there was no selection menu, just a command line, yet there still was an OS (even if it was doing much less than what a modern OS does).<br /><br />One of the main uses of an OS is to allow for multiple programs to run at the same time  : For instance, you can open Firefox and Notepad++ at the same time (and in addition your OS will display what those programs does in the screen, in addition of displaying a task bar, etc...) and all these programs of them will &quot;run&quot; without seeing eachother, something not possible on a system without an OS).<br /><br />However in some embedded applications and in the good old DOS there was only a command line and a single program running (non multitasking OS) which makes me not understand why the OS is useful in the 1st place. Of course I know it is useful but I don't know why, so I can only speculate.<br /><br />My guess is that it can abstract hardware details (so you don't have to code your application for all motherboards in the world, all graphics card in the world, etc...), and it can help to recover errors (like a segfault). On the Commodore 64 (which is debatable whenever it has an OS or not), if you would do an error you'd see weird colours on the screen and the computer simply crashed, you'd have to reboot it to return it to normal. With DOS this normally wouldn't be the case any longer.<br /><br />Which leads me to the following question : What is an OS for the NES of any use ? There's no need to recover from errors, and no need to abstract hardware details as a game engine revolves around them basically. So in a normal NES game, the game engine &quot;replaces&quot; the OS.

Real mode DOS let the applications have full control of the system. You often would have to hit CTRL-ALT-DEL after the system froze. It is possible that a program could detect an error and print a message and exit properly, but that is just as possible on something like the C64.
