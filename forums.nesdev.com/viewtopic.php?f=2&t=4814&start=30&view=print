<br />In fact, rNES_sprite0hit() is exactly what you proposed:

<br />That read could just cleared the vblank bit also, and you miss it.

<br />
<br />I think there could be ways to make it work.  If I were to design it, I'd probably do something like....
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">void rNES_setnmicallback&#40; NMIProc callbackproc &#41;;<br /><br />void rNES_enablenmi&#40; int enable &#41;; // 0 disables, 1 enables NMI<br /></div><br /><br />rNES_setnmicallback would need to be called once at program startup to set the function pointer to which the program would call on NMI.  The NMI handler code in the lib could be something like<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">NMI:<br />&nbsp; PHA<br />&nbsp; TXA<br />&nbsp; PHA<br />&nbsp; TYA<br />&nbsp; PHA<br /><br />&nbsp; JSR __do_whatever_to_call_callback_proc__<br /><br />&nbsp; PLA<br />&nbsp; TAY<br />&nbsp; PLA<br />&nbsp; TAX<br />&nbsp; PLA<br /><br />&nbsp; RTI<br /></div>
<br />
<br />I think that a setup like this would clash with the idea of a waitvblank function that utilizes NMIs -- and therefore stick to my recommendation of omitting the waitvblank function from the API completely.
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT -- apparenly you would want to use char or unsigned char instead of int, though (after having read the documentation).  I always thought 'int' was to use whatever data size was fastest on the platform -- strange.
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT2 --  Here's where I read that about interrupts...  in the FAQ of all places.

<br />Well C's definition of as I recall it is that int should hold values at least between -32768 and 32767 and up to but not more than long int, whatever size the specific compiler assigns to long int.
<br />
<br />
<br />edit: When using NMI routine, do you do some sort of signaling between the rendering routine and the program's logic?

<br />Well, there. In other words, Interrupt handling in C is a pain in the ass.
<br />I don't even know if all that values stacking and all won't render the interrupt handling unusable.
<br />
<br />As for now, my library's users ( which would be like... about... just me ) will have to conform with reading $2002.

<br />
<br />Polling $2002 works for sprite #0 hit, but that's about it.  I forget the exact details, but there are times where the flag will be reset faster than it can be polled.  I remember one old demo I made with music in it, when I saw it running on a real NES for the first time, the music kept randomly speeding up because of it.
<br />
<br />I'm guessing that's why NES games do the vblank wait loop twice, because it doesn't always work.
<br />
<br />The most simple NMI routine I've ever used was just this:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">NMI:<br />&nbsp;inc nmi_count<br />&nbsp;rti<br /></div>
<br />
<br />And that works just as well as anything I normally do.

<br />I think I may have to really learn asm sometime and possibly rewrite all this to fit gamedev's needs.
<br />All this code seems to be written having in mind only writing characters to the screen, in fact it originally had all the background tile section occupied by the charset.
<br />
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />As I can see here, the zero page variable 'tickcount' is incremented each NMI, and I can use it for vblank, as Memblers suggested.
<br />I know that this variable is at offset $6B so I can access it.
<br />
<br />Do you say I use this method? waiting for $6B to become non zero?
<br />Wouldn't that be the same as reading $2002.7 ?

<br />It might work the same on any emulators (I know of) right now, but definitely won't be the same on NES (and l'd bet most clone systems too).

Also, if one wants to code a NES-like platform in C, one could just use the guts of a NES emulator and compile as a regular PC executable. It could be made virtually identical to what you'd get with cc65, except you'd have unlimited time per frame, and it wouldn't run on a NES.

<br />Not a bad plan, actually. It's only bad if you have little time to handle lots of enemies. This is actually my case, so I'll have to optimize as much as possible.
