<br />
<br />Use an 32 pin IC socket, and it sticks out a little.
<br />Bend up the pins (1,2,31,32) and put a piece of tape underneath.

You mean bend the pins without soldering them, but solder them to wires directly ? Isn't that pretty much risked electrically (noise immunity, bad contats, etc...) ?

<br />he put Heroquest on an UNROM (check out board scan).  do you think he used a socket?  the cart pic doesnt show any holes.  i opened up castlevania and it had a 28 pin PRG.  i wonder how he did it?

<br />The only differense that were is that UNROM-07 had all connecor pins present, even if not used, and that it was written "LS-32" and "LS-161", while UNROM-08 and UNROM-09 had "HC-32" and "HC-161" written on them. However, CastleVania had HC chips even if it is written LS on the board. I think LS chips would render less reliable voltage in their outputs, but they would be faster (delay is 8ns instad of 15, I did that at scrool :wink: )
<br />An alternative would be to burn it on a SGROM board with a MMC1... It would need few software modifiactions, and SGROM has room for 32 pins chips, and is perfectly compatible with UNROM, as well than ANROM, AOROM, BNROM, and UOROM. Only the software should have a few modifications. For example, to burn a UNROM board on a SGROM card :
<br />Instead of :

<br />It's not a lot of modifications, but it would just need some room in PRG ROM.
<br />AOROM would be compatible as well, but writing to $9fff would be needed to each bankswitching, because the single screen selection is merged with the rombank swlection. Also, the MMC1 should be set in 32kb bankswitching mode.
<br />CNROM and GNROM are also emulatble as well, with a SLROM MMC1 board with CHRAM.

<br />Noise isn't a problem at all, just make sure you connect any unused pins (like PRM to vdd or vcc).
