I tried moving, attacking, jumping, etc, so I think that rules out the sub-frame movement issue.<br /><br />@tokumaru, so that would explain the games on the &quot;3&quot; list on the original post? I think arkanoid is well programmed, at least it looks super clean and smooth, but it has that extra lag frame.

Only history of left/right button presses (or possibly time between last button state change) is required, waiting is not required. Only waiting for A+B for jumping is required.<br /><br />@nesrocks: They way you count frames of delay should be wrong. I am fairly sure that there is a delay for punches and kicks, but it should be a constant amount of frames. It varying randomly between 3 and 10 is unthinkable. Simple quick testing with VirtuaNES indicates me a constant 6-frame delay.<br /><br />Note that the delay between punches and kick is the reason why the game is challenging at all. If they were instantaneous (aka you press A and next frame your punch is in your opponent's face) then the game would be almost unloosable. That tiny window where the enemy can attack first is what makes the game dangerous, and as so, fun to play.<br /><br />Dragon Warrior games as well as Ultima seems to wait that the engine's frame counter is at a multiple of 16 before starting any movement, probably because their scrolling engine is awfully simplified. This provides a delay varying randomly between 1 and 16 frames when moving to a direction after stopping, but no delay when moving and changing direction. This is acceptable (but annoying) because in RPGs timing is not very important, but this would be unacceptable for any action game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not counting it wrong. Open double dragon 1 on fceux, pause the emulator, press and hold &quot;A&quot;, hit frame advance 11 times and then the character starts the punch animation. I counted 14 right now on level 4 for the elbow attack. It is inconsistent. Yes, I am including lag frames. I could get it to respond in 2 frame advances when walking (not punching) at some point, but that was the record, not the rule.<br /><br />Double dragon 2 and 3 are consistent. 6 frames.

Pressing a letter associated with the A button and then the space bar for frame advance simultaneously can get the OS confused about what to do and it is possible that the emulator does not frame advance even when you press the bar. This might be why either of us can get the count wrong (i.e. too many frames before action). At least for me counting was hard, sometimes it didn't work at all and the character wasn't punching. It's really tedious to see. Playing a &quot;video&quot; with frame advance, and pre-recorded buttons might be a better idea to do that but I don't know how to do it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm a veteran speedrunner, I know what I'm doing. The most basic thing is a frame advance... Here are my TAS: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tasvideos.org/Subs-295up.html">http://tasvideos.org/Subs-295up.html</a><!-- m --><br />My frame advance key is set to left control, so that problem is non existent. I configured it that way exactly because of that, and I do the same for every new emulator I use, so much so that if the emulator doesn't allow me to configure it like that I don't even use the emulator anymore. Besides, the keyboard ignoring keys is consistent. If A+X doesn't work that's because it won't ever work, so I couldn't be advancing just some frames. I'd be in an eternal stop if that was the problem. So no, I'm not counting it wrong.<br /><br />What emulator are you using? Is it configured to ignore lag frames? It shouldn't be. As I said in the original post lag frames are included because they are part of the experience and add to the total real response time, which is the point of the whole test. In fact,<strong><em> ignoring lag frames is a terrible idea overall for testing anything</em></strong>. Turn it off and redo your tests.<br /><br />Here's the thing, since there are lag frames:<br />walking may take 2-3 frames<br />kicking may take 5-6 frames<br />punching may take 11-12 frames<br />It all depends on when you pressed the button<br /><br />I have tested double dragon U, double dragon J and even the beta rom and all of them are like this.
