So if a store has price tags on everything, these would have to list both prices. The main thing they really can't do is have a surcharge for cards; any price difference must be framed as a discount. Apparently buyers prefer not to have cash discounts, because they believe it implies higher prices and thus shop in places that lack the discount. I love my country.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Fri Feb 26, 2010 4:07 pm</p><hr />

Truck stops around Indiana/Ohio/Michigan generally offer cash discounts, for diesel at least.  "Swifty's" gas stations has a cash discount around here, that was great when I had my Aerostar van.  But I've never seen any other place offer cash discounts.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Feb 26, 2010 2:52 pm</p><hr />

A lot of us were confused because payment cards in the United States tend to have no annual fee. Some high-end credit cards with certain kinds of rewards have an annual fee, but ordinary credit cards make money for the bank on finance charges (i.e. interest). Debit cards sold as "gift cards" have an issue fee, but debit cards linked to a checking account or (in some countries) a PayPal account make money on loans that the bank makes using the money in the account. And both kinds of cards make money on the merchant fee.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Feb 26, 2010 7:17 am</p><hr />

I was talking about the anual free. I got it free for this years when I turned 20, but I'll probably have to pay $100 per year to continue having it - which I don't want to since I only used it 2 times this year (and I'll use it a last time to order my super power pak).<br /><br />Of course I have a debit card but you can't make payments to outsider countries (or it's very complicated). But if it's possible to transfter funds directly from a bank account to PayPal then it would make the credit card even more pointless.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Feb 26, 2010 6:32 am</p><hr />

Are you talking about the yearly fee, or interest on the credit? If you don't want a credit card, get a debit card. They work equally well for online payments, and the fee is like $10/year (at least in my bank).<br /><br />Besides, PayPal now allows you to transfer funds directly from a bank account to your PayPal account.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1181">mic_</a> — Fri Feb 26, 2010 3:11 am</p><hr />
