I've been able to save until I rescue the bowwow.<br />After that, if I save and then load I see link on a white screen. If restart and load, I'm back at the last save before rescuing the bowwow (which now is at the entrance to the cave where I rescue it).<br /><br />I've tried both the fix uploaded to this thread and the one on your page.<br />Any ideas on how to fix this?<br /><br />Thanks!

So if you aren't using the fix it's looking for, it'll mention it. It was an idea I added to my menu to help warn people that might not know a particular game requires a fix. <br /><br />Anyway, I'll try to test this out again when I have the chance.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Out of curiosity's sake, has anyone come up with a way to extract the saves from specific games when there are multiple on the cartridge, even if it can't be done live on the cartridge (as in transferring the entire save to a computer, extracting/injecting into the file, and then putting it back on the cartridge)?<br /><br />Also, I think I remember reading that the menu is saved in the SRAM.  Does that mean that if you only have one game save on the cartridge and you read the SRAM, it will only be the game save, or will it have menu data in there as well?<br /><br />Lastly, is it not possible to fill up a full 32mb page?  When I try to install 32mb exactly worth of roms, I'm told that there is not enough storage space.<br /><br />Sorry, I'm still new to this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The menu has to be stored in the same space as ROMs. You cannot put 32Mbits of game roms on a page unless it is one 32Mbit game which also means you'll have no SRAM management as you have no menu.<br /><br />You can extract a single save if you want. I thought someone made a tool but you can do it manually if need be with a hex editor. SRAM is 128KB in size and can be saved from the flashing program.<br /><br />Once you save the 128KB image you just need to know which 8KB block to extract. The first 4 blocks are temporary storage. All the following blocks excluding the very last one are game storage blocks. The very last block contains menu save data which does hold a list of game titles if you need help figuring out which block is the game save you are looking for.
