		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Basically it should be possible to determine the length between the taps on the resistor and determine some relative value, and get some idea what the voltages would be on each tap, then there would also be an additional voltage drop over the pass transistors but i assume that there is not much current so it should be small except when the transistor has just turned on and current is flowing into capacitive elements.<br /><br />I guess it is the tint transistor that HardWareMan is mentioning, although there is also a transistor that grounds video out as well.<br /><br />The output levels measured by kevtris should only be an offset of those voltages caused by the voltage drop over the bipolar transistor he measured the output on. Since the color burst seems to be triangular the peak voltages on the output are most likely attenuated so the actual voltage from the taps on the resistor for color burst should be lower/higher to achieve that shape.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I hooked my pal nes up to an oscilloscope today and checked the video-out pin from the ppu, the color burst and regular color waves seem to be equally attenuated so there should be no phaseshift between them. Anyway, what i found interesting was that since the attenuation is pretty high and the waves are almost ideal triangle waves the video signal for colors are pretty far off from the peak values, color 00 resulted in a voltage of 1270 mV, 0d 448 mV and colors 0x oscillated between 576mV and 904mV, and sync was 88mV above ground. I made some quick measures on the output from the video-amplifier while connected to a tv as well, and it seems that low frequency signals retain their amplitude while high frequency signals are amplified so the end result is a pretty nice sinusoid oscillating at a higher amplitude than the triangular one from the PPU. I didn't get any good measurements done since i was running out of time for today and only held the probe agains the soldering point for the av-out video connector. I made measurements of all the voltage levels if anyone is interested about pal version of the PPU.

You might be seeing some low-pass filtering.</div><br /><br />Yes, both NTSC and PAL nes suffer low pass filtering, that's why the output are triangle waves instead of square. The PAL color burst frequency is also higher (almost 25%) than NTSC so that is why the color waves are more attenuated than for NTSC.<br /><br />The oscilloscope probe should not have any noticable effect on the measurement so it should only be the parasitic capacitances of the driver transistors in the video dac as well as the base capacitance of the emitter follower transistor that causes the low pass effect.
