<br />bah, i wouldn't have wanted the NES to sound anything like FM synthesis.  it has its own sound-- and i wouldn't change it for anything.

I personally found worse to have terrible imitation of instruments than to use just analog sound, the best by all is still to have fair imitated instruments. So that's why it's an insult to say the NES output MIDIs, not only it is an insult technically, but also the sound of MIDIs back in the time was even worse than the sound of the NES.

<br />
<br />The first widely popular video game console in the United States to use FM synthesis, which was patented by Yamaha at the time, was the Sega Genesis. (It also included a PSG identical to the one in the Sega Master System, which could output 1-bit noise and 50% square waves.) The first widely popular sound card for personal computers based on the IBM AT architecture was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdLib" class="postlink">AdLib</a>, which was also based on a Yamaha FM synth. Millions of people were exposed to Yamaha FM through AdLib cards as well as through Creative Labs' Sound Blaster cards that included a clone of the AdLib chipset, and millions of people were first exposed to standard MIDI files through Creative's MIDI driver that worked on AdLib or compatible chipsets.
<br />
<br />Therefore, among consoles that were popular in North America, it's the Genesis that "sounds like MIDI". Apparently, the Genesis is said to sound closer to the NES than to the Super NES, furthering the misconception.

<br />
<br />The Adlib can be used on any PC, whereas AT architecture implies a 16-bit ISA bus and at least a 286.  It is quite a stretch to speak of an "Adlib" chipset when speaking of the Adlib Sound Card.  The Adlib is really just a chip, the YM-3812, with an ISA interface.  The Sound Blaster may rebadge the chip, but Creative used discrete Yamaha chips until the days of the AWE32.  
<br />
<br />When one speaks of "midi sound", they associate the FM synthesis of the Adlib with the low end of that sound.  The Adlib was suited to midi because it had pre-defined instruments contained within the chip, as opposed to the NES where the sound composer had to create each sound manually.  The problem with game music was always how to keep the size of the music down while keeping the quality high.  Unfortunately, there is no quality control in the standard and to get good midi you need a good synthesizer module, which costs serious money.  Midi is one way to do that, but today sound compression techniques and larger media do its job more consistently and don't require the need for such modules.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />GameFAQ reviews are crap. Most old games' reviews are, but GameFAQs are in particular. Reviewing an old game is so much more difficult than reviewing a current one. To properly judge graphics and sound, you need to know
<br />
<br />a) what is possible on the old hardware (hardware knowledge)
<br />b) what other games of the time were like, how the game being reviewed compares to its contemporaries (market knowledge)
<br />c) how to get old games running in their correct configuration (just because it somehow runs without crashing doesn't mean that this is how it's supposed to look/sound). This is especially a problem for classic PC games; typical mistakes are not recognizing PCjr/Tandy 1000 support, CGA composite color graphics, playing back MT-32 music on a modern sound card with a bad "MT-32 emulation mode".
<br />
<br />Most reviewers know neither, writing nonsense like "well, looks like crap, but hey, it's 15 years old, so considering the age, the graphics are good blabla". If they're a real piece of work, they'll complain about "ugly bright colors" because they're using the Nesticle palette.
<br />
<br />As for MIDI: it's a way of exchanging (MIDI protocol) or storing (Standard MIDI file) song <em>performance</em> data (somewhat like sheet music), not store <em>sound</em> data. It's designed as a tool for <em>composing</em> music, not playing it back; in fact, you'll find that a lot of the music you can buy on CD has been produced in the studio using MIDI. However, if you abuse it as a consumer playback format with your so-called "high quality sound fonts" (cough, cough), it's your fault, not the format's.
<br />
<br />For classic PC games, you won't get around MIDI. Here you must be careful to play it back on the device the music was composed for. To play back classic PC game music properly, use a Roland MT-32 sound module (original, not a software emulator, not an MT-32 "soundfont") if the music has been composed for MT-32 (rule of thumb: if it doesn't support General MIDI), or a Roland SC-55 if the music has been composed for General MIDI (rule of thumb: if it supports General MID). Then it will sound right, in many cases better than a Super Nintendo or an Amiga.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">Great Hierophant wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The Adlib was suited to midi because it had pre-defined instruments contained within the chip, as opposed to the NES where the sound composer had to create each sound manually.</div>The Adlib's YM-3812 does not have pre-defined instruments within the chip. I think you're confusing this with the VRC7's YM2413 (OPLL) chip; that one had built-in instruments.

<br />And yeah, the fact that the NES produces analog sound instead of the digital sound usual to people cannot be compared to a storage format, as the MIDI is. MIDI is "supposed" to sound bad beacause the sound font playing it back will never sound like the original song, but it's a storage format where you actually store a melody and NOT a audio waveform, like in all the most popular music format. So yeah, people say that MIDI suck and that MP3 is cool, that the NES sound suck and the Playstation 2 sound is cool, and they don't even know what they're talking about.

<br />
<br />Analog and Digital in this context are nothing more than buzzwords.
<br />
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">All</span> sound (or at least all sound you hear) is analog.  It has to be... or else you wouldn't hear it.  Digital sound is nothing more than the representation of audio through 'digits' (numbers).  Of course.. you can't really listen to a big string of numbers... so the digital sound has to be converted to analog for you to actually hear it.
<br />
<br />So yes, the NES produces analog sound.  But so do CD players, PCs, TVs, and every other device on the planet.
<br />
<br />Also... before it gets converted... NES sound is also digital!  All computer generated sound is (unless you have one pretty <em>insane</em> computer... though I don't think such a computer exists).  Before those square waves get converted to analog sound, they're nothing more than a stream of 0000FFFF0000FFFF's (digital).
<br />
<br />So all audible sound is analog.  And all computer generated sound is digital <em>at one point</em>... but is eventually converted to analog when its played back.  Somewhere along the line these terms got mishmashed and 'digital' suddenly meant 'high tech' or 'high quality' or something equally nonsensical.
<br />
<br />I always thought it was strange/silly when I read in docs that the NES had "5 channels:  4 analog and 1 digital"  :P
<br />
<br />
<br />Just thought I'd pop in with that.  I'll leave now ^^'

<br />
<br />I have never heard these definitions before... and to be honest, they sound rather made up.  =P
<br />
<br />But like I said... the terms 'digital' and 'analog' got mucked up from being thrown around in this context.
<br />
<br />Somewhere along the line, people started to hear 'digital' and instictivly thought 'high quality'... and eventually 'digital' became a buzzword that no longer meant what it really means.  I can guarantee you some people think SNES sound is digital because it resembles instruments while NES sound is analog because it sounds like beeps and boops.  I've actually heard someone claim that in the past.  Your definitions are the same nonsense, just rephrased.
<br />
<br />But if you want to use digital/analog to distinguish between basic/complex waveforms... that's your call.  All I'm saying is that's not at all what the words really mean ;P
<br />
<br />
<br />I don't mean to make such a big deal out of this... it's just a pet peeve of mine.  Right along side people who say the NES has "8-bit graphics" when in fact it does not.
