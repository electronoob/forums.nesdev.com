You're saying that the MMC6 contained RAM that was optionally utilized. That will probably require a new "Mapper WRAM" field is all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">How would these soft-patches be distributed? As separate patches to prg and chr? As zipfiles containing a patch to prg and chr? As patches to a virtual file containing two or three concatenated files (a 16-byte file, "prg", and "chr" if present, in that order)? And how would soft-patches that change the board type by adding WRAM, a battery, etc. work?</div><br /><br />I would say a patch file for each rom in its own container with an extension of ".xxx.zip" with xxx being whatever the format is. Byuu kinda gave up on UPS after he realized it had some issues with expanding roms, but it's still better than IPS, mainly because it prevents you from applying to a file it wasn't designed to be applied to. That feature is less useful for NES where header ambiguity was never an issue, but it's still useful.<br /><br />Why even worry about this right now? One step at a time.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So the main file contains only games with the Official Nintendo Seal. I understand the reasoning behind this. But if we limit it to only unlicensed games commercially released in North America and Europe prior to the release of the Nintendo 64 console (Sunday Funday  yes, Battle Kid no), I don't see how an additional ZapFC_North_American_Unlicensed_(20110216).fbsv file containing Tengen, Camerica, Color Dreams, etc. would be a nightmare to maintain. There's a finite set of these companies because there's a finite set of their CIC defeat circuits.</div>
<br />
<br />So your argument is basically "a selected portion of infinity wouldn't be a nightmare to add." I'm sorry, I see exclusion rules based on release timeframes and stuff to be way too wishy washy. Distribute them in iNES until someone makes a customizable mapper file extension for ZapFC containers.

<br />The point of ZapFC is to do so for finite ROM sets, such as all NES games carrying the Official Nintendo Seal. The burden of guaranteeing proper headers for unbounded sets of homemade games is on the developers of such homemade games, and so far they've been doing a far better job than the administrators of some ROMz sitez. To make things perfectly clear: <strong>NES 2.0 isn't going away.</strong>
<br />
<br />The perceived attack on homebrew here is not unlike the angsting on Wikipedia over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability" class="postlink">its "notability" standards</a> by people who have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest" class="postlink">conflict of interest</a>.

I want a unicorn. Let me break this down for you based on merit, not popularity. There are basically 3 ways to deliver mapping:<br /><br />Emulator-side mapping cons:<br />-cannot support unlicensed games because it is not humanly feasible to add and maintain an infinite number of entries.<br /><br />Rom-side mapping (separate, customizable file) cons:<br />-cannot guarantee mapping integrity of a downloaded game because there are hundreds of different suppliers who may have out of date or messed up files.<br />-requires users to update files or download new versions of them to effectuate mapping updates and revisions.<br /><br />Rom-side mapping (header) cons:<br />-cannot guarantee mapping integrity of a downloaded game because there are hundreds of different suppliers who may have out of date or messed up files.<br />-requires users to update files or download new versions of them to effectuate mapping updates and revisions.<br />-does not allow for custom mappers to be created.<br />-must duplicate data to account for instances where the same data shipped on operationally different boards.<br /><br />The optimal method is not choosing just one, but emulator-side for licensed games and rom-side (separate, customizable file) for unlicensed. You seeing this now? And all of this is independent of how the rom data is stored. Here's that comparison:<br /><br />Header-defined container cons:<br />-requires specialty tools per system to obtain or compare simple information like prg and chr sizes and checksums. dumpers and patchers will hate you.<br />-requires emulator-side mapping to add prg and chr size fields to each database entry.<br /><br />ZIP/7z container cons:<br />-slightly more difficult to support if an author didn't already?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">There is no reason to resort to personal attacks because I raised concern about your suggested format.

<br />
<br />For licensed games, yes. Because it's the only type of game that can. ZapFC also changes the way roms are stored, which coincidentally allows for an extensible mapping format someday for unlicensed games.

<br />What benefits can a database offer me when I'm suggesting to add support for an optional header file <em>so that not all ROMs are depended on a database</em>?
<br />And how is this supposed to piss dumpers off (Assuming they for whatever reason would want to dump a game that <em>cannot be played yet</em>)? Maybe something along these lines: "Oh, gee... I'm a dumper and I can add an optional header file so that others can use this ROM without a database... I can't stand this! I'm quitting!"?... Seriously?...
<br />
<br /><em><strong>op·tion·al</strong><br />[op-shuh-nl]<br />–adjective<br />1. left to one's choice; not required or mandatory: Formal dress is optional.<br />2. leaving something to choice.</em>
<br />
<br />You, sir, have lost all my support in this file format because you have repeatedly demonstrated your complete lack on interest in the publics opinion and suggestions.  I'll say it straight out: this format is useless in its current state, and because nothing we say or do will get through to you (We're on 10 pages already and <strong>no</strong> progress has been made!), the format doomed as well. I'm sorry I have to put it this bluntly, but you insisted on bad behavior.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">-cannot support systems without a well-defined concept of "licensed", such as Atari 2600.</div><br /><br />That's not an additional cost, that falls within the same one I listed. If that means a system can't use a database because it doesn't have a manufacturer-defined library, then all its games end up using the rom-side method.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">By "per system" did you mean...</div><br /><br />Per console system. The more that there are, the more specialty tools you have to use. It's just dumb luck that weren't more systems with multi-rom games. Conceptually, it's a minus.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What library for ZIP container do you recommend for tools written in C to manipulate fc.zip? Would you recommend zlib+minizip or something else? Also, what do you recommend for unlicensed games in the ZIP/7z container without storing a frankenfile inside?</div><br /><br />I'm assuming you would just pick one? Why does this matter? And no, you can't have combined or interleaved data in a ZapFC container per the spec. And the files have to be named "prg" and "chr" so that the emulator knows what they are.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I hereby propose an extension to fc.zip to allow distributing unlicensed games in a standard container. It would act as one step (at a time) to transition unlicensed games from ad-hoc descriptions in frankenfiles to richer mapper descriptions in standard containers. Allow a third file with name "fbsv", containing the same data as one line of a board database. It is used as follows: <ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>If the checksum of "prg" and "chr" matches the checksum in the emulator's board database, ignore the "fbsv" file. Emulators' data overrides possibly outdated data in ROMs. </li><li>If the checksum in the "fbsv" file does not match that of the "prg" and "chr" files or is otherwise unparseable, fail and display a diagnostic. </li><li>Otherwise, treat the "fbsv" file as a one-line extension to the board database. </li></ol></div>
<br />
<br />I would recommend the third file be called "board" and you go all the way with it so as to allow for custom mappers. Just making it contain a database entry doesn't allow for that. Unfortunately, this is beyond my skill level and I have no idea if we could ever get people to agree on the formatting of such a file. If nobody sounds interested or they can't come to an agreement, then I like just having a database entry in there.
