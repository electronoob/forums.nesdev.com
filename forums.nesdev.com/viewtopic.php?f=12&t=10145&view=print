		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just a quick question here... I've noticed when looking at some 74LS139 chips, some of them say &quot;Dual 2 line to 4 line Decoder/Demultiplexer&quot; while some instead are called &quot;Dual 1 of 4 Decoder/Demultiplexer&quot;. But both are 74LS139s, and have the same pinouts and from what I can see the same function.<br /><br />For example:<br />T74LS139M1 chip - <a href="http://www.datasheetarchive.com/T74LS139M1-datasheet.html" class="postlink">http://www.datasheetarchive.com/T74LS139M1-datasheet.html</a><br /><br />VS<br /><br />74LS139A - <a href="http://pdf1.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/27996/TI/74LS139.html" class="postlink">http://pdf1.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/27996/TI/74LS139.html</a><br /><br />Just curious because my local store has a bunch of the T74LS139M1 that they are trying to clear out, and I've used the 2-4 line 74ls139s before and had no issues with decoding a SNES game with them.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a FF6 cart here, which uses a SN74LS139N to select between the 3 rom chips. That appears to be a 1 of 4 decoder version (according to the datasheet i Googled).<br /><br />So, for the purpose of using one of these decoders to select between 3 or 4 flash chips in a SNES cart should work regardless of whether its a 2-4 line or a 1-4 line, right?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ignore the description; look at the part number. First, remove the letters. If the remaining numbers don't match, then it probably won't work. If they do match, examine the letters in the middle of numbers, e.g. LS, HC. If they match, then it'll probably work. In some cases nonmatching letters are compatible.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A '139 chip is a decoder with 2 inputs and 4 outputs.  The 2-bit input is a binary representation (00, 01, 10, 11), while the 4-bit output is what is known as &quot;one-hot&quot; because only 1 output is ever active at once (active-low, so 1110, 1101, 1011, 0111).  Because of that, you select &quot;one of the four outputs&quot; or you could also say that the &quot;two inputs are decoded to four outputs&quot;, hence &quot;one OF four&quot; or &quot;two TO four&quot; are the same thing.<br /><br />Also, the difference between the letters in the middle (e.g. LS/HC/HCT/etc) describes the technology family (e.g. TTL/CMOS/etc.).  The SNES uses TTL logic, so the ones used in SNES carts are LS.  However, a more compatible alternative, in case you wanted to replace the ROM/RAM chips with CMOS parts, would be the HCT family, which has TTL-compatible inputs and CMOS outputs, which follows the design paradigm of permissible inputs and strict outputs.<br /><br />74**139 is a standard catalog part, 54**139 is military-grade.  I'm not really sure what the difference between CD74xxx and SN74xxx is...
