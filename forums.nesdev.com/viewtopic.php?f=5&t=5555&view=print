But as flash players and such continue to require greater resources graphics related things such as HD videos wont play very well. For this reason I need a graphics card. So what should I get? My computer don't got no fancy graphics ports so I need PCI.

<br />it dose not have a AGP slot, but its not THAT old. its a 1.5ghz celeron
<br />
<br />I would hate to blow the money but maybe Ill have to get a new computer and use this one as a file server
<br />
<br />I also have a little atom netbook I got earleyer this year and it dose better.

If you go for a cheap Dual Core it will becomes quickly obsolete as Quad Cores are getting a increasing part of the market. Altoug, it's possible that some Dual Cores are still better than some Quad Cores, you also have to take the frequency and other things in account to really see a CPU's power (and it is really a complicated science). An additional core don't double the equivalent frequency contrary to popular belief.
<br />
<br />As long as you're not a PC gamer or only play relatively old games you should rather look into a good CPU rather than a good graphic card. As long as you avoid the really low-cost crap (like Celeron stuff) you should be fine.
<br />
<br />And if you want to save money wait a year after Intel released something so that AMD release their impoved/cheaper counterpart. Don't always work tough, but often it was like that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you only do internet and watch video, my answer would be no.  Unless the applications you are using take advantage of the 4 cores, this is a waste of money and electricity.  i7 quad core is 130w on the go so you will need a good power supply depending on what's inside the machine.
<br />
<br />The dual core E8400 3.0ghz is still the best bang for the buck at the moment.  I'm more than happy with it.

<br />
<br />If you want to save money go for a AMD CPU (anything in the "Athlon X2" series should be decent) and a computer to mount yourself as opposed to an already packaged/installed one, I always did that and it was fine. (this don't apply to notebooks tough obviously).
<br />
<br />I'm getting a new notebook soon and I still don't know if I'll get rid of my old desktop PC (which is "only" 3.5 years old), I'd give it to you if it weren't really heavy to ship.

<br />But I need help picking out a motherboard to go along with it.
<br />
<br />help with that and outer advice would be appreciated.
<br />
<br />My question is an issue of compatibility the "Phenom II X2" part is confusing me there are ones that say Phenom II and Phenom II X4 and I'm wondering if all of them works with this processor.

<br />where it says "customers also bought" ,  click view all to see if people also bought the X2.  On this motherboard they have. So this one should work.
