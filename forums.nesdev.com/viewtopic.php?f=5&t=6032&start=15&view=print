FCEUX's main page says its intent is to combine all branches of FCE Ultra together, including FCEUXD.  I assumed that meant it would be the definitive version.</div>
<br />
<br />From what I can tell, the symbolic debugging feature of FCEUX does not work the same way as in FCEUXDSP 1.07. I have been in contact with the FCEUX developers about this, as it would be nice to see the feature work as well in the "combined" version as it did in the SP 1.07 version. I'm actually not certain if that is because they changed the format of the namelist files or if there is a problem, hopefully I'll find out soon.

<br />Yeah if it wouldn't be too much trouble I'd like to try it out.
<br />
<br />I tried FCEUX (whatever version was current a few months ago) and it crashed every time I loaded Legend of Zelda hacked to FME7. Also, reading the palette from vram hadn't been fixed so I just went back to FCEUDXSP (which also crashes from time to time).
<br />
<br />The Lua support looks nice for viewing game state data without having to code it into the game or viewing it  in the hex editor.

<br />
<br />[Booting]
<br />Operating system: Ubuntu 9.10
<br />
<br />[Prototyping]
<br />Music: Modplug Tracker in Wine
<br />Graphics: GIMP, occasionally graph paper
<br />Game algorithms: occasionally Python
<br />
<br />[Editors]
<br />Edit .s: Gedit
<br />Edit .png: GIMP
<br />Edit .nam: (formerly) <a href="http://www.pineight.com/pc/#ted" class="postlink">8name</a> (but now) 8name II
<br />
<br />[Build process]
<br />Convert .png to .chr: pilbmp2nes
<br />Convert .s to .o to .prg: ca65 + ld65
<br />Make lookup tables: Python
<br />Coordinate all this: GNU Make
<br />
<br />[Testing]
<br />Quick test: FCE Ultra 0.98.12 from Ubuntu repository
<br />Daily test: PowerPak
<br />
<br />8name II and pilbmp2nes are written in Python. They aren't available yet, but the first release of the Concentration Room demo will include them.

<br />Since I busted my powerpak, I'll likely go back to eproms and test carts for real hardware testing.

<br />side note: I've been attempting to develop eclipse plugins to assist with NES development,  but I dont have anything working yet.  My hope is to make use of the extensibility of their plugin system to provide a central development environment, regardless of whatever assemblers, emulators,  a person prefers.

At first I wasn't sure that it would be useful as I wasn't sure it would recognize 6502. But with the customization features available, I was able to make it recognize all the 6502 instructions, and highlight them all blue. Then comments are green, things like ".incbin" and ".include" are red... All the lines are numbered... I certainly hope there's more than 1 undo, which is something about Notepad that drove me nuts. I'm just relieved to not have to open my code and have to look at a sea indistinguishable black terminal characters. So yeah, I'd recommend downloading it if you haven't already.

<br />I would recommend that you try some of the UserDefinedLanguage for notepad++ that some of the members of this board (including me), made. 
<br />
<br />There's is a lot of things you can do with it (notepad++), so many that I cannot mention all of them. Of simple thing is highlighting all instance of the word you selected.  I'm sure that will you will be more than happy to leave notepad.  Tools are important since they will save you time in the end <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> Knows your tools and you will save more.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, it seems there are a ton of features I just have no idea about. But highlighting is probably the most simple, but it is such a significant feature for me. I'm doing a complete revision of my game engine, which shouldn't take nearly as long as I've already coded everything once and decided on formats, etc. And now with notepad++, this will be an even easier process. Oh, and I didn't even see at first that you can have multiple files open in the same instance of Notepad++, and just go to one by clicking on a tab on top. You have no idea how annoying it is when you have too many files open with Notepad and they all combine into one thing on the taskbar, so then you have to click on that one each time and select which text file you want from a menu... So I'm glad I won't have to deal with that anymore!

<br />You can disable that annoying behavior by right-clicking the taskbar, selecting "Properties" and unchecking the box that says "Group similar taskbar buttons". That's probably the first thing I do every time I install Windows XP.
<br />
<br />Anyway, maybe you'll like the double view feature in Notepad++ as well: When you have multiple opened documents you can right-click their tabs and select "Go to another view", and each view can have it's own set of tabs. I use this to compare documents, to edit different sections of the same document without having to scroll up and down all the time (you can have the same document in both views - "Clone to another view"), things like that. I find that terribly useful.
