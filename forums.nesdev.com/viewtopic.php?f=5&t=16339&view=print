		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd like to stay automatically logged on on Youtube in order to be able to have the automatic suggetions of video I'd be interested to (a real time killer...) and to see channels I've subscribed to.<br /><br />However the problem is that they use the &quot;Google +&quot; account for that. Then Google also monitors all my google search I do and I do not want them to be linked to my account. I try to use duck duck go or bing whenever possible, but let's admit it, the results of searches are shitty 60% of the time while Google more often gets what I want. Which means when I want to search the web without Google tracking me I need to:<br /><ul><li>Attempt to search with Duck Duck Go or Bing</li><li>See and at least half of the time &quot;shit, this search engine doesn't understand what I mean&quot;</li><li>Open a privacy browsing window</li><li>Google search in the privacy window and get the result I want without being logged in</li></ul><br />This tends to be tedious. But if I log out, then my Youtube is extremely shitty and generic and only show recent hits by celebrities or whathever, completely useless.<br /><br />Is there a better way to handle the problem or should I continue like this ?

I don't have a YouTube or Google account at all, so I don't log in; but as long as I don't close the browser, YouTube gives the relevant suggestions along the right edge, according to the things I watched on YouTube since the last time I opened the browser.  I mostly watch computer history, aviation, and WWII stuff.

Sounds like a major problems with memory leaks - I've experienced people who leaves a browser open and leaves the computer there for a week and then the computer is almost nonfunctional or very laggy as the memory is more than full.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I use different browsers for different tasks.</div><br />I guess it can do the trick... although it's not very different than using privacy windows for google search if I have to open a 2nd browser that don't log me in Google. Basically it's the same thing.

Great !</div><br />I'm not sure what assumptions you're making about what Chrome does, exactly, but Firefox has a very similar &quot;user profiles&quot; feature, so anything I said could apply to that instead. (Its UI for it is slightly more out of the way than Chrome's.)<br /><br />Or there's Chromium too, of course. I have no idea what browser is acceptable to you in this respect.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I guess it can do the trick... although it's not very different than using privacy windows for google search if I have to open a 2nd browser that don't log me in Google.
