The situation is not unique, PC-10 ROMs have an extra 8KB on the end of their files that emulators ignore unless they support the PC-10 (few do).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think using a NES 2.0 submapper for each combination of mapper and ADPCM chip that's verified to exist as real hardware makes more sense than adding entirely new header fields just for them. Whatever type of sound chip is used, its registers have to be mapped in a way that doesn't clash with mapper registers or with SRAM--you can't just stick a 7756 onto any arbitrary cartridge PCB--so tying them to mappers seems reasonable to me. Let's not recreate the NSF lunacy where people can and do compose &quot;NES music&quot; that uses one of every cartridge sound chip all at once.<br /><br />Once the type of ADPCM chip used by a cartridge is specified, I think it's fine to say that the ADPCM data goes after the end of the CHR data (or after the PC10 Z80 data in the entirely hypothetical case of a PC10 cartridge with an ADPCM chip) and its size is dictated by the chip type. We don't use a header field to specify the size of the EXRAM in MMC5 cartridges, after all.

The length of the file provides the minimum amount of information to include <em>just that</em>, but any further discovered data needs become extremely difficult to accommodate. Lidnariq made a comment about ordering of PC-10 data vs this hypothetical extension, which isn't specifically a problem for anybody, but it was a small representation of the kind of problems that can easily arise: multiple appended blocks are likely to require some data about their size.<br /><br />Yes, my suggestion was to build that information into the appended data, instead of putting it into the header. Yes, as an answer it was a little bit oblique to the letter of B00daW's question, if you really want to interpret it that way, but I did honestly feel it was relevant to a larger context here. Sorry, if this is not what lidnariq wanted to talk about, but his response felt bafflingly and unnecessarily hostile toward it. I didn't initially want to make a big thing about it either, but he said some things I thought were worth responding to.<br /><br />Yes also, the particular problem of these jaleco carts doesn't have this case, but I thought it was reasonable to suggest something that might ease the pain of having to renegotiate the format every time something new comes out. In particular the argument to restrict it to commercial era games only...!!! (I'm pretty certain B00daW is interested in being able to emulate new homebrew hardware ideas, and so are a lot of people.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But unless the extensibility is carefully planned out, it isn't going to be easy to support on an NES flash cart such as PowerPak or EverDrive. Is it practical to make a UNIF loader in 1K of code on a 6502? Because that's all you get for each overlay.</div><br />I wasn't advocating UNIF, or even thinking about UNIF, though looking at its format now I am reminded that it does use a chunked format.<br /><br />I don't think PowerPak's lack of support for UNIF has anything to do with the chunks. The hardest thing that would be hard to fit for code size is the insane number of unique board names instead of an iNES mapper number, but even that has feasible solutions, IMO. PowerPak doesn't have a UNIF loader because few people use it and bunnyboy or other capable people just aren't interested in it. Chunks themselves aren't hard or impractical to parse at all.<br /><br />In this case though I was only suggesting chunks for appended metadata. Not UNIF, not MAME (yes, ZIP compression is a pretty significant problem), just what to do with some extra data which has hitherto been unavailable and thus ignored by emulators. The Jaleco data seems very &quot;optional&quot; to me, and chunks are easy to optionally ignore. (The current emulator solutions seem to be simulation via a collection of WAV files in the same directory.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And as <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=149030#p149030" class="postlink">I mentioned two years ago</a>, chunked NES ROMs are going to be incredibly difficult to patch with things like IPS or xdelta3.

If you want IPS compatibility, the PRG and CHR are still where they always were. We've been discussing how inadequate IPS is for a long time, though.<br /><br />So... sure IPS wouldn't work on the appended chunks, if there's many versions of the ROM out there with different orderings (though this is not much different from the PRG variation problems we already have due to lack of a CRC check), but as a spitball idea the entire problem might also be solved with a &quot;patch&quot; chunk just appended to the file too; the patching process wouldn't need any special tool, just a simple concatenation!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Similarly, if you don't want a ROM with MP3s in it, that's no problem for you... you don't have to download that ROM!

Before May 11, 2017, including support for MP3 in an emulator would have incurred patent liability.</div><br />MP3 was just a hypothetical example for the purposes of arguing about whether wild homebrew hardware ideas should be accommodated. I don't personally feel there's a reason to decide they should never be, or that they can't necessarily be planned for in advance, and that seemed to be the argument that Lidnariq was making.<br /><br />The suggestion was really that I think it would be worthwhile to continue the iNES format in a more extensible direction if possible. Instead of having arguments about what the minimum possible amount of data we need to represent is, make it possible for users to add the things they need.<br /><br /><br />Anyhow, I'm not exactly trying to say that chunks are the only way to go, I really just wanted to float the idea while we're discussing possibilities. I do think <em>something</em> belongs somewhere in the file to indicate how much extra data follows; even reserving 1 bit in the header for &quot;has <em>something</em> appended, see mapper definition for how to interpret&quot; would be better than trying to use the length of the file itself, I think. Or if not in the header, some signature just before the appended data to verify that &quot;yes, this is the new stuff&quot;.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I owe Rainwarrior an apology.<br /><br />Not only was I horrifically rude, but I strongly suspect we were violently agreeing: NES2.0 is an inappropriate container for arbitrary extra data to be determined in the future.<br /><br />(To make it perfectly clear, I would have no problem with someone putting an MP3 player inside a Famicom cart, and then someone wanting to dump that and play it in an emulator. I just don't see any practical way to package that in a NES2.0 file.<br /><br />That's what I meant when I said &quot;I object&quot;: with only 20ish bits remaining, there isn't enough state left to describe arbitrary variable-length binary attachments. The µPD775X ROM actually includes a table-of-contents inside it, to let the decoder know where of the up-to-256 different playback entries start. Something similar would be required for anything else. I assume that some of the bytes inside the M50805 also serve a similar function.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 50%; line-height: normal">&quot;Hilariously&quot;, ogg files actually support enough internal metadata to be able to scan a file to find each of the separate audio streams inside, while MP3 doesn't.</span>)<br /><br />The entire original question then got bogged down into ... at least, <em>my</em> misunderstanding, and perhaps also Rainwarrior's.<br /><br />So: I'm sorry.

Lots of things aren't power-of-two sized, and that 1MB limit is really low. If there's a blob of data whose length is not fixed, just put that length info into the blob? For consistency, always leading that block with its total 4-byte size might be prudent, to facilitate the <em>option</em> of skipping an unknown blob, though probably some blobs wouldn't be as optional as extra audio data. (I just think it's valuable if the structure of the file is still parsable even if the meaning of the data isn't known; e.g. still being able to analyze the NES file even if you don't know anything about a new mapper's definition-- there are useful things you can do with NES files besides emulate them.)<br /><br />That's why I suggested at most 1 bit in the header to indicate its presence or non-presence, or alternatively just some kind of signature at its expected position, though a signature followed by a size is effectively a &quot;chunk&quot; ;P<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Myask wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">We could specify PRGbanks=0 to be PRGbanks=$1000, while we're at it.</div><br />I am not sure what's best to do with PRG of 0, though I do think it bigger PRG support would be a better use for some of the remaining bits than an auxiliary blob size. (Ha ha, as a silly thought you could set PRG size as 0 and have a mapper whose real PRG goes in the aux blob.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As I understand it, there are three approaches to packaging a rom in terms of popularity.  The first and most popular is the concatenated approach of iNES where you join header + prg-rom + chr-rom in one file.  The second method is the split directory/zip approach, where every rom is its own file and all the roms needed to make a game run are contained in a single directory or zip file.  This is the approach taken by MESS and higan/nSide.  The final approach is the UNIF approach where you have one file with a chunk format which structures the ROMs and configuration information in the file with defined labels.  It does seem easier to use either the second or third approach to add new data to existing ROMs, but given their relative lack of popularity, the tacking on approach of iNES will probably prevail.
