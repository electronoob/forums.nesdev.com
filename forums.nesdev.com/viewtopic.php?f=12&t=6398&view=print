If so I read its one of the known 'problem' games (Like Super Mario RPG/SA-1) which can only be played on a console with a working matching lockout chip, in this case either a US SNES or JPN Super Famicom.
<br />
<br />If you are trying to play it on a PAL SNES one option is to mod the console with ikari_01's clone lockout chip, see this thread for details:-
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=5676&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=60">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopi ... c&amp;start=60</a><!-- m -->
<br />(The first post on that page even mentions the problem with S-DD1 games)
<br />
<br />Alternatively, if you can re-enable the PAL lockout chip in the SNES console you could mod the actual game, as mentioned in a post I made over at the gamesx forums:-
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nfggames.com/forum2/index.php?topic=3507.msg24458#msg24458">http://nfggames.com/forum2/index.php?to ... 8#msg24458</a><!-- m -->
<br />Pin 82 on the S-DD1 allows you to switch the lockout chip between NTSC and PAL modes.
<br />
<br />I hope that helps <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />I tried to play the game on a Super Famicom yesterday, and on a modded PAL SNES today, both giving the same results.
<br />
<br />I don't think the malfunctioning is caused by the S-DD1's CIC. I guess that it is working just like any other CIC (in "key" mode), so if SNES CPU is not reset, it means that lock-CIC receives the valid binary sequence from S-DD1, so it should be receiving the valid one too.
<br />
<br />Maybe the cause is what <strong>kyuusaku</strong> said but... can somebody confirm it?

<br />
<br />Yes, of course I did! I was playing SO on my Super Famicom for long, and supposed I could do the same through GDSF7. I was corious to know why. Not is that I really want to play it on GDSF7, just ccuriosity.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well I don't know if anyone has researched the issue, but it's fairly safe to say somewhere between the cartridge and the console in the GDSF7 signals are not being passed or are not getting through or are not coming through as well. With Mega Man X2/X3, the Cx4 chip works through the GDSF7, but is glitchy in its behavior. For Mega Man X2 (or X3, one of them) you can't get into the game or atleast I couldn't. But the other game went in game and played with some errors but the Cx4 did function for certain tasks like putting the sprites on screen like Mega Man X.

<br />So, Star Ocean doesnt look like this?:-

<br />Thats how it looks when the games CIC disables the S-DD1 processor.
<br />
<br />The picture is from ikari_01's post in the thread I linked to previously:-

<br />
<br />Some time ago, neviksti made patches that decompress the GFX and expand the game to a 96mbit ROM, basically creating a version that doesn't require the SDD-1 chip. So you can run it on the GD7, but not from the cart.
<br />
<br />Google found the patches available here <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.racketboy.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=16943&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;start=30">http://www.racketboy.com/forum/viewtopi ... a&amp;start=30</a><!-- m --> look a few posts down on that page.

<br />Thanks for the link. I was looking for some information about how to split ROMs larger than 32 Megs in GD3 format, since my copier has 64 Megs RAM and want to play Tales of Phantasia on it.

You can also make them into 12 megabit pieces if you are using 1.6mb format disks. You may also be able to make 10 megabit or other piece sizes but I never tested it.

<br />
<br />I'm using uCON64 v2.0 to split the ROMs (and to convert them to GD3 format), but when trying to convert ROMs greater than 32 megs, it prints an error message: it says it can't convert roms greater than 32 megs....

Basically if you take the SMC non-interleaved ROM you just need to go and interleave it. Then you just need a GD3 header, which you might be able to figure out a working one for ToP by looking at the 96mbit Star Ocean hack for GD3 format. 
<br />
<br />Or a program may already exist.
