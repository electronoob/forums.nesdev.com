<br />I'll stop short of calling you horrifically dense, but you are missing something - namely the part where I said I already have CF support but I want to target a platform (TerASIC DE1) that doesn't have CF, but has SD.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />I think the point is that CF has TrueIDE mode, which makes it ideal when you have an IDE controller, or want to connect an IDE device.
<br />
<br />As for SD being "easy to work with", that is true if you're satisfied with slower transfer rates. And to be fair, that's usually the case when you're emulating retro computers. The faster parallel interface modes are a bit more involved, and the 4-bit mode is AFAIK still not open.
<br />
<br />In my case, I have an IDE controller but I want to hook up an SD card. Stupid? Perhaps. But there's a reason - I'm targeting a particular FPGA development board.

<br />
<br />I dunno, my DMA unit was pulling 200-400Kbytes/sec through the SD card using SPI mode.  I don't think that's TOO slow.   The 6502 could never hope to achieve anything close to that, probably topping out at only 10% of that.   I used a DMA unit that I could just load up with a start address and length and it would blast it at 10MHz from the card to the SDRAM.  This made loading SID tunes and things practically instant.  Hit the button and it loads and plays faster than you can blink.
<br />
<br />The biggest advantage to SD for me is size and pin count.  A CF card is the size of a small city and would've taken up 1/4th or more of my PCB realestate.  I wanted to place a normal SD slot on it, but even that was way too big.  I finally settled on microSD due to space limitations.
<br />
<br />A 16GB microSD card cost me $25 and will hold every single thing I would ever want to run just about.
<br />
<br />The number of pins on a CF card also sucks.  Granted you don't have to hook them all up of course to your FPGA or whatever, but there's still a large number of lines to connect.  It's basically hooked up like a small RAM chip.  D0-7 (or D0-15) and then 3 address lines and some control signals (/RD, /WR, CE, etc). 
<br />
<br />The SD card only has a few signals in contrast.  clock, data in, data out, chip enable and a card detect signal basically.  FPGA IOs are a very hot commodity so saving them is important, 'cause it lets you add more cool gadgets to the device.

<br />Heh, understood.
<br />
<br />My colleague started on a 1-bit SD interface (clocks faster than SPI) a while back when we were looking at working on an embedded xvid player (which we got running in a soft-core processor, but the colour-space conversion was too slow - that's another story). Anyway, I was looking at the opencores SD controller recently, but thought it was way overkill for my needs; I 'borrowed' the SD device model from it for simulating my colleague's interface. After I wasn't getting anywhere with it he took a look at it, and claims that the model is "completely broken". He made a few fixes and claims it is now intialising the card properly. I've yet to start back on it... so yeah - the point of this rant is that I know where you're coming from.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />Oh I agree completely. And I'll be hooking this up to a 4MHz Z80 and a 1.78MHz 6809 initially. So I could've gotten away with SPI, but my colleague convinced me to use his "almost working" SD interface. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> So here I am...

All expansion audio is implemented now (VRC6, VRC7, MMC5, FME7, N106, FDS, drip mapper audio).<br /><br />The entire NES+mappers+etc took almost 700K bytes of verilog code in 68 files that I banged out in the last 2 months.</div>
<br />That's really cool.  I'm not even close to where you are.  Is this all still fitting in the Cyclone I with ~12K LEs?  Or have you moved to a larger device?  It's hard for me to compare Altera devices resource wise to Xilinx (which is what I'm using) since Altera vs. Xilinx resource terminology is very different.  It looks like on your new board the Cyclone chip is a bit bigger this time around - did you move up to a Cyclone II instead?  Also, (and yes I realize this may be considered NDA/proprietary/secret so I don't actually expect an answer to this, lol) what current resource utilization are you at within the cyclone with the entire CPU+PPU+APU+mappers+etc? 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%?
<br />
<br />So from you've said it appears you've moved away from the original PIC microcontroller and replaced it with this Vinculum 2 instead.  PIC is certainly very popular whereas I've never heard of the Vinculum before.  PIC also has good IDE tools and lots of freely availble IP.  Why did you switch away from the PIC?  Was there something that you just really didn't like about it?
<br />
<br />Also, I sent you a PM regarding a very specific CPU design question.  I didn't post it here because it doesn't relate at all to this topic and don't want to get things off-track.  Mind taking a peak?

That makes 2 NES (or any other USB) controllers usable with less parts.  Indeed, with one design I'm working on with PIC32, the only thing I'm disappointed with is only having 1 USB host port (it seems there's no Microchip library for using hubs), after going through the trouble of powering it to the full specs. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />But yeah thought I'd just mention too, that I've seen and played kevtris' console at various times through it's entire development, what's always been striking is the level of detail (including many obscure and normally unused CPU/PPU features), and the bizarre behaviors of so many different mappers and NES boards that kevtris RE'd.  Playing it, the video and sound was identical to the NES, even with weirdest ROMs like Micro Machines (with it's $2003 polling).

<br />I gathered that much, but not sure where the 3MHz 6309 comes into it.
<br />
<br />The stock Coco3 has a 1.78MHz 6809. A common upgrade is the 6309 for running a special version of Nitros09, but the clock speed remains the same. The only overclocking I know of for the Coco 3 is SockMaster's 4MHz mod.
<br />
<br />So I'm a little confused by the comment?!?

<br />
<br />That's a little hopeful for companies that make the clones.  There already are accurate (precise photocopied) clones of the die (maybe not in production anymore I guess), but they'll probably go with whatever is cheapest and available.
<br />
<br />Would be cool though if those companies had the wisdom to at least ask kevtris about it, but I don't think that "giving it" would be the right way to word it.  It's a pretty huge project.
