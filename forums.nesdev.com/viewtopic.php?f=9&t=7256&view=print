Likewise, the CIC microcontroller and its clone Rabbit have been decapped in the process of making <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1219" class="postlink">CIClone</a> and <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=5676" class="postlink">Super CIClone</a>. Would it be worth it to do the same for the PPU, to help figure out the reason for other quirks such as power-up behavior or OAM refresh behavior? Or to do the same for the NES CPU, to see the details of the clock divider, DMA unit, sound unit, and the exact way that decimal mode was disabled?

If it were, it would be possible to remove the PPU from a console and drop in perhaps an FPGA board that is an exact copy of the PPU except for being able to output a higher quality signal like S-Video or RGB. And just in general it would be great if the exact NES circuitry were preserved forever.

<br />
<br />Also keep in mind that there might be slight difference between revisions, such as those weird OAM behavior.

<br />Would be interesting to look at mappers too, more out of curiosity though.  It would be interesting to compare the PPU to the TI chip in the Coleco also.

<br />
<br />If anybody is qualified to do this and will dedicate the time, I can send samples of multiple PPU &amp; CPU types and revisions (ditto on the other components that'd be useful to R-E).
<br />
<br />I can try to extract stuff out of Ricoh and Sharp, but getting docs on 30-year old HW is tough, even when they are willing to release them.
<br />
<br />I already need to wiggle some sttuff from Sharp and Mitsumi, so I'll see what I might achieve. I have some other video chip schematics from other consoles that people may want or might find interesting for private trade or gift. 
<br />
<br />I won't talk about what they are in detail in  public, to save me from both harassment and possible legal issues from exposure. If you know this stuff inside-out and want anything, send me a PM.
<br />
<br />Likewise if you want to undertake the PPU decap, PM me and we'll talk about it in detail.

The CPUs destroyed in the process came from Memblers and hyarion. I lack the resources to do the polygon drawing by myself, though.
<br />
<br />If anyone wants to send me PPUs to make die shots of, that's fine (PM me for my current address), but I cannot promise that I will find the time to do the decapping and shooting in the next few months. In any case, if I don't find the time personally, I will forward the PPUs to other people from the visual6502 project who may, but we already got a lot of other chips, so don't expect immediate results.
