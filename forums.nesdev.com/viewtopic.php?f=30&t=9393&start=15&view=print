So it sounds like this is basically a community fundraiser: the authors aren't getting any compensation (no royalties, no complimentary cartridges, etc), and the proceeds are going to fund things like the nesdev competitons.</div><br /><br />That is how I've envisioned it.  We can't have royalties if this is to be a fundraiser.  I feel like Tepples and thefox have put in an exceptional amount of effort into the selling points of this cart and I think it would be nice to reward them with a complimentary cart.  I'm curious what other people think about this though.  In the future once we have fund built up it might be nice to reward compo entries with complimentary carts for *competeled* games (hello world/pongs don't count...)  really these things are up for the community to decide.  The best answer right now is probably just no complimentary carts for sake of argument/debate...<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So who's going to be in charge of money?

And it sounds like the ROM will be released as well?</div><br /><br />The only thing I ask is to be 'in charge' of the funds until I've made the money back I've invested to produce the first 50.  I can maintain it beyond that if people would like.  Otherwise the sum or most of the money could be put into a money order or something and kept under custody of a moderator or something.  I'm open for ideas and input on this matter of maintaining funds.<br /><br />I think the easiest way to decide how to spend the funds is just have a voted thread.  Not sure what kind of limitations could be put on that (no newly created profiles etc.) to keep things from getting out of hand.<br /><br />As for the 50 number.  Under the current situation I'm willing to front the money and volunteer my time to make the first 50.  Beyond that the funds collected from the first 50 could be used to purchase supplies for more carts.  The other question beyond 50 is are we willing to pay for labor for assembly and how much.  If we'd like to leave assembly for volunteer work I'd have to ask other trusted members to lend a hand.  I understand the idea of myself making money on the labor of carts is somewhat of a conflict of interest.  So I'd rather leave that up for other people to discuss and I'll give my input if requested.<br /><br />I figure let's make these first 50 and see how it goes.  We can make decisions on how to go about producing more carts afterwards.  I'm willing to help keep them available for purchase beyond 50.<br /><br />Unfortunately it looks like the weakest link right now is CICs.  I'm working with jimscool right now trying to get this last bug figured out.  Hopefully that is resolved soon, then we'll be able to know what to expect for delivery dates and final cost.  Id like to have those details ironed out before trying to do reservations/preorders or anything.  I think contributors should have a reservation by default.<br /><br /><br /><br />Things are looking good with the rom Tepples.  Testing out in my CPLD/PCB now and everything looks to be working well. I did notice similar to what thefox was saying most games reset to the menu vice the game.  Not sure if that's expected/planned but would be nice if it were consistent.  Does stuffing several smaller  NROMs in a single slot make this a difficult?  In that case I guess having as many reset the game only would be preferable IMO.<br /><br />I wonder if we can come up with a better saying than 'make your selection now!'  something more homebrew/video game oriented? IDK, just a thought.

Actually just a list of the checksums for all 50 numbered carts would be sufficient.  I think it's crc32, I know it's the same format that bootgod uses.  It's actually less work for me to fill in the cart number by hand.  Otherwise I'd have to reload the file for each rom, not a big deal, just a bunch of clicking and not being sure of which number is currently loaded.  My programmer software appears to allow me to change the rom image by hand before flashing.  I'll have to verify this for myself though.

If I'm wrong I'm more than willing to work with people and ensure that contributors have an opportunity to purchase a cart.  If someone is more concerned about this than myself I'd suggest starting a 'wishlist' for people to sign up if they'd like to purchase a cart.  No ones responded to my proposals to the price point so I can't say how much they'll be.  Perhaps such a list of expectant buyers would help us decide on a price point.  By the looks of the rapid progress Tepples has made it sounds reasonable that I'll be able to start production before the end of the year assuming CIC issues can be resolved as well.  Worst case can use CIClones if need be, but that's $3+ per cart we loose unless they were to give us a better deal.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I can make a special build of STREEMERZ that goes back to menu when reset is pressed (I've already got reset detection code in there so it's not a big deal).</div><br />Actually that would be high unpreferred for a game like streemerz.
