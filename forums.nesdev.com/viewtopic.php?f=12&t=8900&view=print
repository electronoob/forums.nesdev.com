<br />
<br />So, I open the cart, and I'm surprised to find a a 44 pin TSOP.
<br />
<br />Does anyone have the pinout for this?

<br />
<br />That is a 16bit ROM, replaceable with a 29L3211 with a voltage stepdown to 3.3v or a 27C322 with significant rewiring needed to adapt a DIP to SOC packaging.
<br />
<br />Pretty much all of the special chip carts (except for DSPx games) use SOC ROMs.

<br />
<br />Just lift the VCC pin on the replacement chip and solder a couple of diodes in series to get a 1.4v drop?
<br />
<br />Or should I use an 85ish ohm resistor?
<br />At least I think 85 would drop the voltage.
<br />
<br />What's the amperage of the current in an SNES cart?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />it's kinda small, but I think he just wired the /WE to BYTE to either a diode or a resistor, and right into that ... voltage regulator?
<br />He may have just soldered directly to VCC. Too small to tell.
<br />
<br />I can barely read it, looks to be AMS1117, datasheets says its a 800ma low voltage dropout regulator.
<br />And it in fact switches the voltage from 5v to 3.3v
<br />
<br />tab on the back is definitely power out.
<br />
<br />so, likely, it's a simple job.
<br />lift pins 1, 23, and 33, wire the back tab of the power regulator to them, the rest is a 1:1 solder.
<br />
<br />BuyIC has a bunch of those MX29L3211 chips, I'll see if they can't burn one for me and test it out next month.

<br />
<br />As for programing the 29l3211s you can buy them for $2.5 each from BuyICNow and they can program them for you so you don't have to bother with an adapter unless of course you want to.

<br />
<br />There is a possibility they both use the same hardware setup.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Like Mottzilla is saying, they're all compatible as they use the same co-processor chip. I have made a SA1 test cart in the past and it play pretty much any SA1 game. I'm saying pretty much because the one thing that differ between cart is the RAM size and wether or not the game use battery backup save feature. You can always add battery backup though. If you take a game like the SA1 Pebble Beach game, you'll be able to play almost any game except for this one specific japanese tactical war game that use an obcene ammount of RAM.
<br />
<br />Edit: the game I was referring to is Daisenryaku Expert WWII: War in Europe

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Because you'd have to destroy a SA-1 game for every single flash cart. Secondly the SA-1 is a 128 pin surface mount IC. Removing and resoldering it onto another pcb is not easy. Next you'd have to design a new flash cart pcb with enough physical room to install a SA-1 and then add circuitry to enable and disable it as needed.
<br />
<br />It IS technically possibly to add SA-1 to a flash cart in this manner but it is not really a good idea. Technically you could make a device and include actual Super FX, Cx4, SA-1, SDD-1, SPC7110, etc. chips inside and have circuitry to use each one if someone really wanted to do so. But it would be extremely costly. It would be cheaper for you to buy all the games. 
<br />
<br />And always realize this, if it were so easy, don't you think someone would have done it already?
