Using trainer and battery together in the way I suggested may be useful if you are making a game and want to specify the initial contents of battery RAM (when copying to a cartridge, you load the first 512 bytes of battery RAM with trainer; same thing with emulators), and it also allows the game to detect if the battery is dead.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />At least in the case of Namco 163/175/340 (ines 19/210), I'm not certain what's really going on. I got a friend to <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES_Mapper_210" class="postlink">translate</a> the <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=77795#77795" class="postlink">linked writeup</a> Naruko had made. I'm a little skeptical of Nestopia's decision to collapse mapper 210 into mapper 19, but without getting a native speaker to play through all of the Namco 175/340 games I'm not certain whether that's reasonable or not.<br /><br />I'm also concerned whether the 175 and 340 don't secretly pose some kind of compatibility issue, but that's certainly solveable using submappers. It would be nice to see a commercial example that made it clear they were necessary, though. (I could clearly write test code that would detect which variant it was being emulated as)

Well, you know: &quot;battery&quot; means &quot;data at $6000-$7FFF&quot; is saved &amp; loaded there, and &quot;trainer&quot; is <em>usually</em> loaded/started at $7000. In software terms, once you load the battery data, the trainer <em>should</em> overwrites it. In my emu, I don't check for battery if there's trainer data.

Maybe someone somehow finds this useful, but I don't know. It seems to me that it would be a usable generalization of several GNROM-like mappers, but I don't know if anyone uses it.
