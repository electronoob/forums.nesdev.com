I feel like I want to know where do I put these. I can't find a word for it but...where do I set the palette? in the &quot;inturrupt vectors&quot; section? &quot;CHR-ROM bank&quot; section? (I kinda feel that one is obvious.) <br /><br />To be honest, no. I'm still trying to understand the concepts. I understand (barely) on number sytem of decimal, binary, and a little bit on hexdecimal, barely understand on the system overview, which I'm starting to forget about it, and 6502 ASM is the one I'm stuck on when writing codes...I sometimes skip that one, but I often go back to there...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yep, $200 is sprite OAM RAM. Then yes, #$FF is the number you put there. That's basically all there is to programming, moving numbers, flags, comparing them, etc.<br /><br />But there's special CPU registers in the $2000 area that are used to do stuff with graphics. The $200 page has to be pointed by $2003 (Write #$00, for start of RAM) and then the special $4014 register for the DMA. DMA just moves the data to the PPU quickly.<br /><br />The PPU also has it's own memory, from $0000 to $3FFF. $0000 to $1FFF are graphics, $2000 to $2FFF are screens, and then $3F00 to $3FFF are graphics. What you have to do is tell the PPU you want to write to the palette, at $3F00 (LDA $2002, LDA #$3F STA $2006 LDA #$00 STA $2006) and then write the data to it ($2007. The location then moves up by 1 or 32 each time, selected by $2000 register.)<br /><br />Help glue some things together? Just read the Wiki over and over to learn how the registers interact.

This would have helped greatly when I was first starting, had I known about it. I didn't understand the relationship between hex and decimal, or really anything at all for that matter in terms of programming.<br /><br />That's a good place to start reading; it doesn't assume you know very much about programming.

Please explain more about what you are trying to do. Be specific about it, not general/vague. What kind of C program do you have? Who wrote it? Where did it come from?<br /><br />Compiling a C program is not a simple matter of &quot;converting C to binary&quot;. To make your NES ROM from it you will need a specific compiler, and a specific build process. This information should be included with the C source files you have, hopefully.

Forgive me if I'm wrong but you seem to have too little knowledge and experience for it.  You need to learn what assembly is, and what compilation is, and what C is, and what the 6502 processor is.  There is also a ton to learn about the NES hardware.  It took me 2 weeks to get rolling and I'm a professional programmer.

Not the official ones for sure, because official docs are intended for experienced developers.
