Action 53 initially comes in 512 KiB volumes, but once all volumes are assembled, the final version is expected to have 2 MiB PRG ROM and 32 KiB CHR RAM. But I'll grant that most multicart mappers are one-offs and thus harder to find a donor for than games sharing a mapper with some common donor.<br /><br />3gen: Even if you have an official PAL NES or NTSC NES, it won't always run software meant for the other TV system. Demoscene productions, for instance, tend to need a PAL NES. One would need to either buy two NES consoles or buy a clone supporting the appropriate TV system.<br /><br />tokumaru: EverDrive N8 solves the clone problem but has the same 512 KiB limit as PowerPak. (Interestingly enough it claims to support the Action 53 mapper #28 but not the Action 52/Cheetahmen II mapper #228, despite Cheetahmen II being small enough.)

Better call it &quot;Homebrew Cartridge Hardware&quot; or the like. From what I've seen the &quot;repro&quot; questions are about things like how to connect an eprom to an address decoder, or a sram with battery. That isn't any secret or illegal information, if somebody wants to learn about hardware then it's just fine. That approach can be much more interesting than buying a flashcart.<br /><br />In worst case it will end up with a messy thread that doesn't solve the problem. Ideally this may end up with useful schematics that could be also used by other people; be it for illegal repros, for legit homebrew games, or just for learning about electronics. And well, if somebody is using that knowledge to create &amp; sell mass-produced pirate-carts then the copyright holder or possibly fooled customers may jump in, but that's a different thing (as long as the repros aren't sold by nesdev.com).<br /><br />I've noticed that the &quot;repro&quot; question is asked twice, once for NES, and once for SNES:<br />NES Hardware and Flash Equipment forum: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewforum.php?f=9">viewforum.php?f=9</a><!-- l --><br />SNESdev forum: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewforum.php?f=12">viewforum.php?f=12</a><!-- l --><br />I think that should be kept separated!<br /><br />For NES, the current &quot;NES Hardware and Flash Equipment&quot; board looks just fine to me.<br />It is marked &quot;Discuss hardware-related topics, such as development cartridges, CopyNES, PowerPak, EPROMs, or whatever.&quot;<br />Looks like the right place to me for people who want to make, modify, or totally destroy cartridges.<br />If necessary you could make some important dev-cart threads sticky (in case they get lost among the repro hardware hacks).<br /><br />And for SNES, there isn't <em>too</em> much activity in that board. I don't think that it's necessary to add a separate SNES Cartridge board there at the moment.

I'm not specifically pointing a finger at anyone. Really I'm not, it's just a contrived example.<br /><br />So a separate forum for homebrew carts, or remix carts, transplant carts, or whatever one would call them, would be welcome to cut down on repeat questions, to try and throw a sticky in there for &quot;how to get started&quot; and &quot;reference information&quot;.<br /><br />Then the development section can become more focused again on the software side of things, or discoveries about the hardware, etc.<br /><br /><br />I completely disagree about the precept that there's flash carts out there, go buy them-- I hate that attitude, and hate how much they cost, and how it's kind of a grey market. Please, please do tear apart your childhood toys responsibly to see how they work. That is learning by doing.

Sectioning them off would be great.<br /><br />It's not like it makes me super mad to see them; my emotional sine wave is not of great enough amplitude.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Creating a section for repros is something I've thought much about in the past.  I've got mixed feelings on it..  It's relevant enough that I wouldn't want to complain about it.  In some cases it's quite interesting.  But in my mind it just doesn't fit under the term 'development'.  Whether it's putting an old game onto a cartridge, or cloning old mappers (or the CPU/PPU for that matter), to me it seems more a way of experiencing history by reenacting it.  Can it be educational &amp; fun &amp; worthwhile - absolutely.  Is it development - I'd argue that it's not.  I'm not trying to be overly pretentious about it, I'm sure semantically that can be argued in all sorts of directions, but I think it's a different animal.  Much like when I do cover songs in a tracker, no matter how many technical tricks are involved with adapting it to the NES, I wouldn't call it songwriting.<br /><br />That being said, I'm voting yes because it would make the other forums more interesting to read.  IIRC, I'm pretty sure that's why the NESemdev section came about - all those damn ass posts about emulator programming were going to clog up the NES programming section. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I don't normally read NESemdev either, there's some brilliant stuff in there, but 95% of the time it's just not what I'm looking for.

I intentionally ignored that ridiculousness only to receive two PM's asking for explicit detail on how to complete their repro.  There is no avoiding the absurdity.  Somehow a crazy ass story of how you broke something that is coincidentally also your hobby to create is supposed to motivate us to write you a detailed instruction on how to make yet another repro.  Unfortunately the few give a bad rap for those who are more tactful.
