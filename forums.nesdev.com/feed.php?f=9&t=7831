Just wanted to point out what you probably already know, that for Flash ROM writing, you will have to relocate the mapper registers.  All the original mappers I've done put them at $5xxx.  But if you must have emulator compatibility, it should be possible to put a mapper/flash select register somewhere, to select where writes to $8000+ are going.<br /><br />CopyNES does that through one of the expansion port pins, that's how my UNROM Flash cart was writable (and I suppose the "PowerPak lite" also).  But it's a bummer to not be able to have the NES program by itself able to write to it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />How can you tell if a logic chip is "common"? And how exactly does that impact my project?<br /></div><br />I use <a href="http://findchips.com/" class="postlink">http://findchips.com/</a> and just make sure it's available at several major distributors.  Good way to see the pricing and quantity in stock too.  Of course, it only matters if you want to put it into production, if you're just making a few of them for fun then you can use whatever you want (in that case, I have some AX5202P MMC3 clones in DIP-40 package, if you're interested in wiring it up - but I don't think they're real suitable for a large production run).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Jun 09, 2011 2:04 pm</p><hr />

Thank you for your input! I have looked at using more traditional memory decoding logic, however this boolean approach just makes a lot more sense to me.<br /><br />What I am trying to accomplish with this initial design is to get a working development cart, and then port my current project over to it as a proof of concept.<br /><br />Obviously for replication a CPLD or similar would be in order. I am not terribly worried about that right now. For now I am just focusing on the bench model.<br /><br />Now I'm trying to hack in a boot ROM and making the Flash ROM writable <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />How can you tell if a logic chip is "common"?

Discreet? Hmm, I guess :P<br /><br />In most designs registers are more appropriate than latches, the time to use latches is the rare case where their transparency will save you from replicating registers to meet timing requirements. (The '161 is a "latch" only in the data-holding metaphoric sense, it's implemented via a register because latches can't implement counters without multiple clock phases.)<br /><br />I'd replace the '373 with a '374 (register). Doing that will also allow you to replace the OR and NOT gates with a '139 decoder. I would also connect D5 since there's no harm in supporting 8M ROMs, they're package compatible with 4M. Emulators probably implement the higher bits too even if the real deal doesn't have them.<br /><br />I'm quite sure you really don't need the pull-ups, but put in a SIP bussed resistor network and try it out unpopulated at first.<br /><br />The '137 and '125 is clever, but the '137 is rare, I've never even heard of it. I see it's obtainable, but I'd go with a regular register, such as the ultra common '74. I came up with this which will let you keep the '125 if you use a '74:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://img810.imageshack.us/img810/5681/mux.gif">http://img810.imageshack.us/img810/5681/mux.gif</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I think the '125 might be more elegant than a '153 if it turns out to be more available. Neither are extremely common, but the '125 has a smaller package, every gate is used and I think it might be cheaper on average.<br /><br />Are you sure the mirroring bits are correct? It looks backwards to me so I have it wired like other mappers.<br /><br />Oh lastly it would be a good idea to use one of the PRG register bits to enable/disable the WRAM by its CE2 unless you're going to put in a battery controller.<br /><br />Lastly lastly, I assume you're opposed to working with PALs, but this design would be a perfect candidate. All the logic fits into a '374 and 16L8 with two functions to spare (they can implement decoded latches).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Wed Jun 08, 2011 2:30 pm</p><hr />

It's another week, do you know what that means boys and girls? That's right, it's time for another of QBRADQ's inane mapper discussions <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />This time I'm trying to create a super UOROM board again, but this time I have an eye to emulator compatibility as well. I have implemented some of the features of the Bandai mapper (iNES #16) in discrete logic, specifically 16-KB PRG-ROM banking, fixed bank, WRAM and 4-mode mirroring select (H, V, 1A, 1B).<br /><br />I think I'll actually try to build this one into a dev cart. I've been itching to do a discrete logic project, and this seems like a good one.<br /><br />Here is the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/qbradq/hardware/ines-mapper-16-subset-in-discreet-logic" class="postlink">project page</a> which includes the combinational logic equations, theory of opperation, the schematic in PNG and Eschema formats and other <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lis.inpg.fr%2Frealise_au_lis%2Fkicad%2F&amp;ei=LLzuTYWnA6TL0QGm0qnfAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGapVOOPuqXt9o6SrbWl5WyZg62RA" class="postlink">KiCad</a> support files. The archive also contains a preliminary <a href="http://code.google.com/p/diy-layout-creator/" class="postlink">DIY Layout Creator</a> file for the perfboard prototype. I've only found this program today so I'm not quite sure how this will turn out.<br /><br />I am looking for some advice on how to connect the mapper board to the NES. My first thought was to take an NROM board, desolder the components (other than the CIC), solder wires to the pins I need, then solder those into a 60-pin ribbon cable header. I would connect that to the mapper board via a 60-pin ribbon cable. That takes care of the cart connector, and I can reuse it latter for other boards.<br /><br />What other approaches have you all seen to get prototype boards connected to the cartridge slot (other than a custom PCB)?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3706">qbradq</a> — Tue Jun 07, 2011 7:22 pm</p><hr />
