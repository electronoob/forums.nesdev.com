		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys,
<br />
<br />I took a look at the code and came the the immediate conclusion that I suck at C++.
<br />
<br />Therefore, I took somebody else's code and added it to filter a lot of stuff that causes noise. It's also able to switch between tracks without having the listener noticing much of a change in volume, as opposed to all the past versions.
<br />
<br />No idea what causes that static in that one track though... although it is only one track that's just something like what, 5 seconds long?
<br />
<br />Anyways... the latest build in forever:
<br /><a href="http://unknown.hcs64.com/pnm/notsofatso-ufmix-dll-02022008.rar" class="postlink">doink</a>
<br />
<br />Please note that VRC7 tracks only work in stereo. Yes, I am lazy.
<br />
<br />Enjoy, I guess.

I think I may have worded that wrong. And only FM channel 2 has static with Med disk VRC7 under K. Horton setting so your progress is getting better. It would also make sense not to abbreviate names like K. Horon should be Kevin Horton.

<br />There is no difference that's noticeable. What is different?

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">0.852<br />- First release by Drag! Huzzah!<br /><br />** Technical **<br />- The code is no longer being compiled with VC++. It has been ported to Dev-Cpp now.<br /><br />- All proprietary VC++ functions (VC++ has some special nonstandard functions that<br />  other compilers and libraries don't have) have been changed or rewritten to normal<br />  non-proprietary functions.<br /><br />- In a related note, Winamp was crashing whenever I tried to play a song, after I<br />  changed the code to compile with dev-cpp. Disch used __fastcall on most of the 6502<br />  emulation code, and I guess dev-cpp handles it differently and in an incompatible<br />  way compared to VC++. All instances of __fastcall have been removed, and now the<br />  plugin works again, but it MAY be using more cpu power than before as a result.<br /><br />- The filesize of the plugin is now bigger, but I'm sure that's because VC++ does<br />  some optimizations by default when compiling, and I haven't messed around with<br />  that yet.<br /><br />** Less Technical **<br />- Notes played on the triangle channel will play for too long in some engines, due<br />  to a glitch in the linear counter. Disch actually had a fix prepared for this for<br />  a long time, but he never added it. (listen to RC Pro Am, and Atlantis no Nazo for<br />  example.)<br /><br />- The hardware decay envelope wouldn't reset immediately when new notes were played,<br />  which means "bing" was more of a "wing" sometimes. This is fixed now. (listen<br />  to Spelunker, Atlantis no Nazo, Dragon Warrior 1, Mario Bros, and Donkey Kong<br />  for example.)<br /><br />- The hardware sweep unit didn't reset its period cycle when its register was written<br />  to. This is fixed, but you probably won't notice.<br /><br />- When winamp was paused, and you press play or change tracks, the position resets<br />  to the beginning, but the song remains paused until you press the pause button<br />  again. This should be fixed now.<br /></div>
<br />Minor things that overall tend to only be noticeable in certain cases.
