<br />
<br />So my question is how did you handle PPU updates and scrolling while also streaming PCM data? Somehow even though I swear the cycle counts were all even, whenever I did a bank switch to get to the next data, there was an inevitable click. Did you just hard code updates in between samples, or did you allow for code to be interrupted somehow?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />if you get a click it means you wrote the wrong value to $4011.. timing problems sound like pitch changes or weird warbling.  As long as most of the audio is played back at a constant rate, occasionally you can take a <em>little</em> extra time to do other tasks.  the graphics stuff is done during vblank as normal, but really i'm only doing a few things each vblank... I just tried to get the most visual effect out of very few writes to the PPU. 
<br />
<br />The trickiest part was actually reading the controller.. I do this between each write to $4011.  There's some branching that has to be done, but you have to make sure each branch takes the same amount of time.  at first I was getting pitch changes when you would hold down the A button but I tuned it (by ear.. it's a lot easier than counting clocks) with blocks of nops.
<br />
<br />oh, and i also used the ntsc/pal detection routine on the nesdev wiki and did some timing adjustment based on that as well.  it sounds right if you boot in either ntsc or pal mode <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />I didn't know the NES could play music with this quality, why didn't the games back in the days have this kind of music instead of the classic midi-like?
<br />I know an obvious limitation would be the memory it would take, but appart from that?

<br />It's why a modern nes clone costs 30 bucks including a huge multicart of hundreds of pirated games, while the original NES was 200 bucks and games were 50, and that's in pre-inflation dollars.
<br />
<br />That and the tune is about 16 seconds and eats up 256KB of ROM.

<br />
<br />I don't really think NES music sounds like a SW MIDI synth though.. There's a lot of music on the SNES that does (not that it can't still be really good, like in Megaman X).

<br />
<br />I seem to remember the 7-bit RAW audio in Gauntlet II not being half-bad with stuff going on onscreen...although it was probably done at a much lower bitrate.
<br />
<br />IIRC on the 2600 Pitfall II had an expansion to multiplex 3 square waves(?) and the chip would give the game code the proper value to write to the TIA. With the limited resources on a 2600 if you wanted BGM you really had to work your code around it (and Gyruss  for the 2600 does that very well).
