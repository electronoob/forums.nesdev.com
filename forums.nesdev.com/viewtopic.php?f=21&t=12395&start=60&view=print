		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, it's not an actual NES game, so there's no problem with selectable palettes at all. My game supports two players simultaneously, so each player is a different color. I decided there's no reason to not allow a person playing alone to pick either of the two colors available. It follows that ports of the game for PC or whatever will probably allow a lot more colors to choose from, because it's a stupid thing to restrict when it doesn't need to be restricted. If players want to be authentic they can always only pick the first two colors, but why not allow people who don't actually care to have some fun?<br /><br />I feel the same way about not strictly using the NES palette. He's already said he's disregarding the sprite limit/other stuff. Will you really keep dogging him on each thing he hasn't specifically said he's not honoring? For all we know, the plan could be what Yoshi's Island does (different Yoshi for every level) or whatever.<br /><br />But if there can be only oneâ„¢, my vote goes to teal. (the one on the furthest right in the walk cycles). And actual feedback, I can't get the idea that his arm is not a French baguette in the run cycle wip out of my head.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sure there are still restrictions. But they were already not NES restrictions when the sprite limit and sprites per scanline limit were disregarded. I think the topic had made its intentions pretty clear, the title is kind of a lack-of-a-better-term thing.

So the more than once is,<br />1. Your Pirates of the Caribbean joke<br />2. Selectable palettes<br />Edit: Or... does 1 not count because he actually <em>did</em> specifically say he didn't honor the palette in that? Even if it was once, I think it's a valid question. I'd be happy to rephrase it, but I think you do understand what/why I've asked.

You've eschewed some of the NES restrictions like in Shovel Knight, but taken the aesthetics of the system to a whole new level. These bigger sprites give so much more room for personality, and the higher framerate has allowed for some fantastic subpixel animation.<br /><br />With that being said, there's not much C&amp;C I could provide. The designs are great but some of your weapons look a little messy. The dark AA on the edges of the Mega Anchor won't look very good on most backgrounds.<br /><br />Also, have you considered posting your work over on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pixelart" class="postlink">r/pixelart</a>? The people over there would go nuts for it!</div><br /><br />I just wanted to say thanks for the feedback, comments like these really help me get enthusiastic to finish off difficult and time consuming parts of the game.<br />I'll be sure to do a pixelart dump in r/pixelart when theres a bit more to show, thanks for the tip.
