I don't really want to get into the nitty gritty drama of the issues I had with the second batch in public, defacing retrozone is not my goal.  So lets just say with the second batch it became apparent that if I wanted a reliable supply of cases in sizable quantities, I needed to obtain my own mold.  That said, I have had good experiences ordering things from retrozone that were listed in stock and available for immediate checkout.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Sat Dec 07, 2013 2:31 pm</p><hr />

Yeah I once thought I was going to print decent NES cases with a 3d extruding/reprap printer.  It's not reasonable for production use though.  The guy making my NES injection molds printed out a prototype with his 3d printer and it turned out plenty sturdy, but has mating issues like lidnariq brought up.

Bregalad is thinking of one of the plaster-based ones, which are what most of the moderately-cheap-but-better-than-hobbyist 3d printers use.<br /><br />Modern 3d plastic extruders work moderately well for specific shapes, but between the lower softening point of PLA and ABS, the lower strength of both the plastics, and the extrusion-based assembly, you'll have difficulty making two parts mate as cleanly as well as you might want. Works ok for a one-off, though.<br /><br />If you're actually looking to make 1000+, definitely look into getting a real injection mold made. Lost-wax casting (or in this case, lost plastic master) is possibly easier than a real CAD solution.<br /><br />For a one-off, getting someone with a CNC mill to make it using subtractive processes might be better.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Thu Dec 05, 2013 7:49 pm</p><hr />
