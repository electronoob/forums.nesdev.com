Why did the NES have so many mappers, while the GameBoy only had a handful? </div><br />Mainly because 90% of iNES mappers are chineese pirates. The other 10% contain about 7% of custom made boards (like Konami, Sunsoft, Bandai and so on), and about 3% of mapper were officially made by Nintendo. The values here are just an evaluation by me to show you the main thing, not result of any exact calculation. In other word, 95% of games uses the last 3% of mappers. I think rich developpers think it would just be better to developp their own boards and mappers, to have a wider range of available features. Why this isn't done on the Game Boy, I have no idea. However, the Game Boy has better protection than the famicom (wich actually had none at all), I think the GameBoy has a bios that deals with checksum and so to verify the game is licenced. So yeah, the Famicom had no protection and that's why chinese have created lots of custom made pirated cart, and each one with it's own circuitry, so it's own mapper.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">3.

<br />This is just one thing Nintendo chosen, I think it would be wastefull to have an area stored in both RAM and register. That would means all registers are read-buffered (a la $2007), wich would tend to be somewhat annoying. Also, I think RAM is a much more usefull use of page-zero than registers, that are acessed somewhat rarely (well, that COULD save time in VBlank, but I don't think it'd make so much difference in the long term, and Nintendo didn't care about that when developping the Famicom).

<br />Can you be more specific as to what you're looking for?
<br />
<br />A frame consists of:
<br />
<br />1 idle scanline
<br />20 (NTSC) / 70 (PAL) scanlines of VBlank
<br />1 prerender scanline
<br />240 rendered scanlines
<br />
<br />every scanline is 341 PPU cycles -- with the exception of the prerender scanline.  On every odd frame, if the PPU is on, the pre-render scanline is 340 cycles instead of 341 (NTSC only -- PAL is always 341).

<br />
<br />Lets says that I'm storing data at $3F01 (PPU), I need to run the PPU to catch up with the CPU. Let's say I use STA Absolute, the write to $2007 won't take affect until the last cycle (#4). If the PPU is rendering pixels while the CPU is running, and there are three pixels per CPU cycle, then at which part of the cycle (0/3, 1/3, 2/3) does the write take place?

<br />
<br />NTSC CPU speed is 1.78977272727MHz.
<br />PAL CPU speed is 1.662607MHz.
<br />
<br />PPU speeds can be determined by multiplying by 3 for NTSC or 3.2 for PAL.

<br />
<br />I'd guess not until the 2nd or 3rd (or possibly later?) -- though it probably varies depending on the circumstances.  I seem to recall blargg mentioning something about the NES has different startup states and the PPU syncs slightly differently with the CPU depending on which state is "chosen" at startup.
<br />
<br />But I don't really know.  I don't think the exact behavior of this is known.
<br />
<br />From an emulator standpoint, this isn't really something I'd worry about anyway.  The worst case scenario is 2 or 3 pixels which are "wrong" at a time when there will always be shaking anyway so you won't even notice that the 2 pixels are off.  (it's impossible for a game to have timed writes to rely on said behavior because the CPU is just too slow -- so any time such a thing happens, the point on the screen at which the change takes place will shake around on the scanline -- see SMB3 status bar and MM3 enemy select screen... the distortion flickers around every frame -- so you can't tell whether or not it's 1 or 2 pixels off).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />kyuusaku is right.  The entire sequence is circular so it doesn't matter as long as the sequence remains the same.
<br />
<br />I find it's easiest to start with the idle ("dead") scanline because it avoids complications with rendering (if you start with pre-render or rendered lines) and pending NMIs (if you start with VBlank).
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">WedNESday wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Also when the NES is switched on, is the PPU reset to the top of the chart?</div>
<br />
<br />Some games are sloppy with the APU Frame IRQs and don't disable them properly (Cobra Triangle and Time Lord, iirc, will lock up under the wrong startup circumstances).
<br />
<br />I've found that starting 10 scanlines <em>before</em> the end of VBlank (10 scanlines in on NTSC, 60 in on PAL) with $2002.7 high immediately will get both Cobra Triangle and Time Lord working without APU Frame IRQ hacks.
<br />
<br />As for the startup timing behavior on the actual system -- I couldn't tell you.

<br />I'd consider that a hack.
<br />
<br />Talking about the VBlank flag, is it set on the first cycle of the first VBlank scanline? The reason why I ask is Ms. Pacman can apparently experience problems with the VBlank flag being set.

The problem you're speaking of only happens if you let NMI occur always at the same time you set the flag instead of after the current CPU instruction.

<br />
<br />I suppose that depends on your definition of a hack.  I would consider a hack to be the employ of behavior you know to be wrong in order to get games which normally don't work to work.  Since the exact behavior of this isn't known -- I think of this as more of a semi-educated guess than a hack.
<br />
<br />But you don't have to take my word for it.  Trace these games (Cobra Triangle, Time Lord) for yourself to see how I came to this conclusion.  Both games use DMC IRQs, but neither disables or acknowledges Frame IRQs -- all they do is switch to 5-step mode.  Blargg has already confirmed that switching to 5-step mode when a frame IRQ is pending will <em>not</em> acknowledge the Frame IRQ, and also that the APU does indeed start in 4-step mode with IRQs enabled -- therefore the only way these games can work is if they switch to 5-step mode <em>before</em> the frame IRQ trips.
<br />
<br />If you start at the start of VBlank (or earlier), the first two $2002 read loops will cause the game to wait too long before switching modes -- and if $2002.7 isn't high right away, it'll wait even longer (over 1 full frame).  Therefore the obvious solution would be for startup time to fall somewhere in vblank.

It's about as far from hacking as possible. I'll have to double-check these things Disch mentions, because some of my notes suggested that the PPU powers up just after the end of vblank (though the VBL flag is also set).
