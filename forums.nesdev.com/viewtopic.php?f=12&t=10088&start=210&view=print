Then program as a 4MB data type on the 4MB board. The programmer software DID NOT crash, but the game did not boot...<br /><br /><strong>HOWEVER...</strong> If I take the 4.0MB expanded rom and load it on a 12MB board, it works just fine...<br /><br />I really think its the 4.0MB boards that are defective in design or the way the firmware writes HiRom games to the boards... I'm starting to think the pack of 10x4.0MB boards that I bought is a waste of money for anything other than LoRom games, which frankly aren't the games I want to play...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wondering if anybody else has ran into the same issue. Decided on a whim to load up Zelda:AST on my 12mb cart. The game works fine, the problem is the character sprite is bugged out, along with actually picking a gender. The roms work fine on emulators and I have tried multiple different versions. All lead to the character sprite being bugged out. The game otherwise works perfectly fine. Any help here?

I have FFV patched to ENG working on a 4MB board, seems to be solid.<br /><br />I've written a couple guides so far (I'm new here, where do you guys upload/post stuff?) that I was planning to share.  I'm working on a few more about padding ROMS and splitting for 6/8MB games.  <br /><br />I will also post my success/fail list here this weekend likely.  Maybe we should start another thread for that stuff?

I'm not sure if the software reads the internal rom info but in FFV RPGe they did not correct the ROM size, it still says 16mbit and not 32mbit (the next size up). This does cause issues for some copiers and flash carts. I don't know that it is needed for INL's carts. I should really try to make time to test more games. Unfortunately for me it takes awhile to program the full 4MB of flash.
