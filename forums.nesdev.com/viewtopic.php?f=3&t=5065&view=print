		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am noticing my emulator does not hide Link under the door frame when he transits through a top-of-screen or bottom-of-screen door in a dungeon.  I originally thought it was a problem with sprite priorities and some kind of sprite overlay that hides Link behind, like the effect in BlasterMaster when the vehicle moves through an arch-way.  However, I do not see any entries in OAM for sprites for this purpose.
<br />
<br />What hides Link?  I see other emulators hide him, and I know that not hiding him makes it look rather silly so is obviously wrong...
<br />
<br />I should clarify I don't mean he isn't hidden while the screen is scrolling.  I mean he isn't hidden as you walk toward the edge, so it looks like he's walking OVER the door frame instead of through the door.

<br />
<br />This wasn't possible for top and bottom doors beacause Link is made of two 8x16 sprites. This would have been possible if he was made of four 8x8 sprites.
<br />
<br />As far I know few games uses the sprite clipping trick on purpose. Castlevania (when entering the castle and falling into water + when secret items pops up from the ground), SMB3 (when items pops out of blocks) and Battletoads &amp; Double Dragon (at the screen between stages 1 and 2) are the only ones I can think of.
<br />
<br />Mega Man 2 uses it accidentally each other frame in Air Man stage if you jump into the life bar.

<br />
<br />I don't believe that is the case. In my emulator sprite priority is implemented and so is sprite masking as used by games like Castlevania and SMB3, but the 8 sprites per line limit is not. When I tested Zelda, traveling left and right through dungeon doors does mask Link like he is going under the tile. This does not happen when going up or down through doors.
<br />
<br />EDit: Nevermind, confusion.

The OAM attribute changes from 40h to 60h when moving through the left door.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">This wasn't possible for top and bottom doors beacause Link is made of two 8x16 sprites.

<br />
<br />I had implemented the emulation of setting the PPUSTATUS overflow bit but not the behavior of NOT showing more than 8 sprites.  Now that I have implemented that Link walks THROUGH doors instead of over them.
<br />
<br />Thanks!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />These tricks are interesting for homebrew development too. Has anyone collected a few of these tricks as examples/guides or at least lists a few games and what tricks they use? While I don't object to disassembling a ROM to find out bits of what it does, my capacity to do that with more than a handful of games in a few months is limited.
<br />If they're secret bits that nobody wants to share, I understand, but from the comments on this thread it seems somewhat common knowledge.
<br />I especially like tricks that don't require an MMC5 or other sophisticated mappers. Mostly because I am only targeting UNROM and CNROM (edit: I think I mean ANROM, the one with just RAM and PRG that doesn't suck) type carts, and partially because I think it's better to know what a NES can do on its own before trying to dig into the complexities of a "modern" mapper.

<br />And there is the big difference that AxROM uses 32KB PRG banks, while UxROM uses 16KB banks and has the last one hardwired to $C000-$FFFF, so they are more different than they are alike.
