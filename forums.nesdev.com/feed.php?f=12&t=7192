<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I always wondered why SNES's reverb always sounded kind've tiny compared to reverb you would hear in trance music.<br /></div><br />This is because they use actual reverb with multiple echo buffers in trance music, while the SNES only have a single echo buffer. So this "infinite" reverb effect is lacking. I know the therm is bad, but on the SNES you can clearly hear repetitions of the original sound at a constant distance.<br /><br />On a more modern reverb, the sounds seems to have an infinity of repetitions that comes everywhere and you can' hear spearate repetitions of the original sound. I guess it's made with 2 or more echo buffers, each one echoing the others buffer, effectively creating an "infinity" of echo repetitions.<br /><br />And I fully agree about the SNES's lacking the ability to reproduce square waves. Music on the GBA which mix samples and square waves is awesome !<br />However, I think it should be possible to reproduce a square wave by doing a fourrier transform, shifting the phases, and re-fourrier transform it to get a different wave, without discontinuities, that sounds like a Square wave to the human ear. Maybe it would compress better into BRR. Maybe not, who knowns.<br /><br />Also "perfect" square waves could be done by filling the echo buffer with sofware writes (instead of enabling the echo normally) but you'd need CRAZY optimized code in order to do it in time, since you only get 32 cycles per outpu sample (the SPC is clocked at 1.024 MHz and the output is 32 kHz).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Nov 28, 2010 3:11 pm</p><hr />

I always wondered why SNES's reverb always sounded kind've tiny compared to reverb you would hear in trance music.<br /><br />I know a lot of people like the SNES characteristic sound quality, but for me it tends to fall in the "uncanny valley" where it isn't horribly bad, but not particularly good either.  I'm surprised neither of the two main competing 16-bit systems had a tradition upgrade from the NES sound chip.  The TurboGrafx was the only 16-bit system capable of replicating the nostalgic NES sound while improving upon it.<br /><br />In another thread, we were talking about how you have to use really long samples just to make a good sounding square wave, because of it's interpolation.  A perfect square wave would only take 2 samples on a traditional PCM chip.  The same thing with a sawtooth wave.  It just doesn't come out as pure and vibrant with all this extra stuff.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4383">psycopathicteen</a> — Sun Nov 28, 2010 3:04 pm</p><hr />

Well as far as I know, reverb is multiple echo buffers with different delay/feedback values. SNES has only one echo buffer, which is why it is called echo and not reverb.<br />The effect is less realistic, but in some case can be just as impressive, as seen in caves of Secret of Mana.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Which brings me to another question: How much memory do games typically use for their echo buffers?<br /></div><br />Definte "typically". Some game such as Castlevania IV uses nothing, Final Fantasy 4-5-6 uses an EDL of 5, Chrono Trigger have it varying in function of the song played, but it uses the maximum EDL = 15 for the 100AD overworld theme.<br /><br />Personally I think very short echo buffer (1-3) sounds really bad as the buffer is short enough to be in the audible range - it can lead to interesting effect, but overall if you're going to use echo at all you want EDL to be at least 5.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Nov 28, 2010 10:46 am</p><hr />
