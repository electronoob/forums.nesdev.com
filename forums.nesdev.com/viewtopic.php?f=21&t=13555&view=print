		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was drawing out some NES art when I started noticing some discrepencies between the palette I was using and the colors being used in various NES images I was sampling.<br /><br />For example, comparing this image:<br /><img src="http://drag.wootest.net/misc/nespalette.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />to this one:<br /><img src="http://dev.bowdenweb.com/nes/a/i/nes-color-palette.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The one on the top has the 0 row much darker and the 3 row much lighter, compared to the one one the bottom.<br />On a good monitor, the difference is negligible.  But on many monitors the difference is much more stark.  On one of my screens the 0 row is barely visible.<br />I'm having a hard time defining my colors because one palette might be to extreme and another might show too little difference.  The exact shade of green I'm looking for could be 1A or 2A; the differences are so strong that I can't even tell which color I would want to use.<br /><br />This has led me to wonder what exact color palette I should use to best emulate an NES display.<br /><br />Now, I do understand that the NES didn't actually operate in RGB colorspace, so there's not quite going to be a single exact answer.  Hell, as I understand it the hardware directly created an analog signal, so even the hardware itself wasn't *quite* exact.<br /><br />But even so, people use a lot of emulators.  Even Nintendo uses emulators.  So, there ought to be some kind of standard available.  What is typically the most common?  What is typically most accepted?  What have people found to look the best on monitors today?  What most faithfully emulates the look the had on the old CRT screens?<br />Something along those lines ought to produce an answer as to what palette I ought to use.

From what I understand, the conversation from YPbPr to RGB color just really doesn't work. So instead, I found a palette that just looked nice on computer monitors and I've been using that since.<br /><br /><img src="http://orig02.deviantart.net/37c9/f/2015/332/d/c/nes_palette_by_dragondeplatino-d9iaf9r.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />This was generated using bisqwit's <a href="http://bisqwit.iki.fi/utils/nespalette.php" class="postlink">NTSC palette generator</a> with the saturation set to 2.0 and everything else left alone. It's a great palette because there's a lot of contrast, it's very vibrant and the red is actually red (not some weird tint of orange or magenta). The only downsides are that the greens don't have a lot of contrast and the yellow is a little dirty. I've found the orange to work as a nice substitute, though.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.spriters-resource.com/resources/sheets/62/65469.png" class="postlink">Here</a> and <a href="http://pixeljoint.com/files/icons/full/mariones.png" class="postlink">here</a> are some examples of it in action.

The palette attached was born.</span>

Otherwise, later games that use shading like Ninja Gaiden 2 and 3, the later Mega Man's and the Final Fantasy's are going to look terrible. Examples of palettes that fail this test are Nesticle palette and the RGB PPU used in the Playchoice 10 etc. (Indeed I suspect the the palettes in Nesticle and other early emulators were based on box and magazine screenshots, which tended to be taken from RGB hardware)<br /><br />Look at the monsters on the poster that came with Final Fantasy (which were clearly screenshotted from an RGB unit) The intended shading on monsters like the Giant and Ogre is completely lost.

In other words, for $00 with red emphasis, the red value would stay the same (101), and green and blue each would be reduced to 76; for 'yellow' emphasis (red + green), the RGB value would be 101,101,76. Having all the color emphasis bits enabled would change it to 76,76,76.<br /><br />This is interesting, though mayhap I have very little knowledge of how color emphasis/de-emphasis works. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Maybe an NES would be more uniform.<br /><br />Hmm, color $16 with emphasis 001 makes a good red...and color $36 with emphasis 011 makes a good yellow. And I really like the dark gray of $2d with all bits set. Maybe I should learn to use color emphasis more.<br /><br />And, apparently (looking at Rainwarriors Palette Tool) you can change $2001 (color emphasis) mid-frame with no problems. So it's possible to use the standard color for one part of the screen, and a color emphasis on a lower part of the screen...doubling your color options.
