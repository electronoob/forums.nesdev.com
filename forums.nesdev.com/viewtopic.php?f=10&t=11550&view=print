		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Implementing DPCM *could* be the easiest thing to do if it wasn't for the controller port/PPU data reading bugs introduced (of which you probably only need to worry about the former)<br />But playing a DPCM sample by itself is incredibly easy. <br />First I advise turning it off by writing $0F to $4015 <br />You simply need to target the starting point with the register $4012. The starting points are aligned to a 64 byte grid, and you can only play samples from CPU address $C000-$FFFF (which is usually the last 16k or PRG ROM) <br /><br />This means you can only start a sample from $C000, $C040, $C080...<br /><br />Then you specify the length of the sample in 16 byte increments by writing a value to $4013<br />You also need to choose a playback pitch by writing $00-$0F to $4010.<br />Then you re-enable the channel to start the automated playback by writing $1F to $4015.<br /><br />You may optionally include a write to $4011 to set the DC offset to a known value, but this makes a pop (in famitracker this is basically a Zxx)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just to confirm I understand:<br /><br />If I write the value $03 to $4012, what that will do is instruct the DPCM channel to start reading at $C0B0 (is this correct?). It won't actually play the sounds until I enable the DPCM channel by setting the bit4 to 1 in $4015, which can be accomplished by writing the value $1F to $4015 hence enabling all five sound channels. If I wish to have the DPCM channel play a sound sample that is, say, 32 bytes long, then I would write the value $02 to $4013. (or would i write the value $01 to $4013?) Then I would write between $00-$0F to 4010 for the pitch adjustment.<br /><br />I take it that the maximum length for a DPCM sample is 4096 bytes?<br /><br />NEW QUESTIONS:<br />1) How do I convert a .wav file into a series of bytes that the program will read?<br />2) Once converted to a series of bytes, do I introduce them into the program as a database like this?<br />Song:<br />  .db $5F, $00, $37, $3B, etc.<br />Would I really have to type into my program up to 4096 bytes per sample all by hand?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello again,<br /><br />Here is my new set of DPCM questions:<br /><br />After importing .wav files in FamiTracker for use as DPCM samples, I implemented them into my FamiTracker song and I am now trying to implement them into my NES game. In Files &gt; Export Text of FamiTracker, it exports a .txt file that has byte information regarding my song. The .txt file I posted here is modified to show a single sample's byte information. I was told that somehow I could incorporate this byte information into my game using some .incbin method which I am absolutely unfamiliar with. I am using NESASM3 as my assembler not ca65.<br /><br />Question 1: How do I use the byte information as attached in the .txt file into my program?<br /><br />Question 2: What is the complete process that you do to take a .wav file and implement it into your game under the DPCM channel? The only conversion of a .wav file I know of is through FamiTracker. The program from the link to the conversion tool provided earlier did not run for me.<br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A long time ago, I made such a conversion tool.</div><br /><br />Question 3: As for pitch adjustment (writing $00 - $0F to $4010), what write keeps the .wav file the same pitch? Can the pitch be adjusted both up and down?<br /><br />I believe it would be possible and very very unnecessarily time consuming to manually type into my program my DPCM byte information for all of my samples by .db but I don't want to do that for a few reasons. First, it would take forever considering each sample could be as long as 4096 bytes. Second, when writing the location of the sample to $4012, that location may change if I otherwise alter my program and hence anytime I make a change to the program, I would have to observe the new location of the start of each sample and obviously that is not the most efficient way to do things.<br /><br />Thanks everybody.<br />-Ray

Does the assembler know from the file extension that the .chr is CHR info and .dmc is sample info?

Since you are using NESASM, this is done by typing <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">bank</tt> and then the bank number, in terms of 8K banks. The iNES header is in terms of 16K PRG banks and 8K CHR banks, so the first CHR bank will be twice the number of PRG banks (so for NROM-256, use <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">bank 4</tt> for CHR ROM).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The assembler does not know anything about CHR or DPCM data. The .incbin directive merely <strong>inc</strong>ludes a <strong>bin</strong>ary file directly into the assembled code, meaning every byte that is in the file gets dumped into your assembled binary at that point you wrote .incbin. The file extension is irrelevant; you can .incbin any file type.<br /><br />If you put proper DPCM data at the right location, and tell the NES to play it correctly, it will play. If you put CHR data at the right location, the NES will render it. The assembler is merely placing data in a file for you.

Let me know if I have this right: If a person has this in their code:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.bank 0<br />.org $C000</div><br />then the following code in the program will be stored there until another one is typed later on:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.bank 1<br />.org $E000</div><br />then the code from that point on will be stored there?<br /><br />QUESTION 2:<br />In my code, at the very end is written:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.bank 2<br />.org $0000<br />.incbin &quot;tiles.chr&quot;</div><br />which successfully implements the 8K of tiles into the game by saving the binary information into the PPU. The question I have is: how come in my .bank 0 and .bank 1 examples, the assembler knows to save the code into the respective locations in the CPU but in the .bank 2 example the assembler knows to save the data in the PPU?<br /><br />QUESTION 3:<br />Can I write any address after .org or must it be some multiple of $1000?<br /><br />QUESTION 4:<br />Why must the .bank part be there? Is that something I'll utilize when it's time to do some bank switching?<br /><br />Another thing: Here is my NESASM3 beginning config I've been using just in case it's important.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; .inesprg 1&nbsp; &nbsp;; 1x 16KB PRG code<br />&nbsp; .ineschr 1&nbsp; &nbsp;; 1x&nbsp; 8KB CHR data<br />&nbsp; .inesmap 119</div>
