You'll have to pay to replace those, which can prove difficult if you are still in school or if the job market in your area is in the toilet.
<br />
<br />Yes, there exist <a href="http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/news.php?show_news=1" class="postlink">emulators that can run DOS apps</a>, an <a href="http://www.winehq.org/" class="postlink">"emulator" that can run Windows apps</a>, and even <a href="http://www.vmware.com/" class="postlink">emulators that can emulate a whole PC</a>. The CC65 toolchain runs natively under Linux, and some of the Windows-based NES emulators run inside Wine.

<br />i had to keep a winxp installation because most PC games are only available for windows (notable exception is id Software titles), or just will not run under an emulator. this seems to be becoming less of an issue as i've seen more and more titles with a linux offering.

<br />For about 6 straight years, I exclusively used Linux.  I ditched Windows cold turkey.  About 10 months ago, I got a new laptop that has Windows on it.  So now I know what it is like to go from Windows to Linux... and then many years later, from Linux to Windows.  I am writing this from one of my Linux computers.  I use Linux 90% of the time.  I use Windows to play games that do not have official Linux ports.
<br />
<br />Regardless of what the zealots say, Linux is not superior to Windows.  Similarly, Windows is not superior to Linux.  Both are crap... but then again, what other choice is there?  A Mac?  It is probably just as crappy as Linux and Windows.
<br />
<br />If you need to run several Windows applications, do not try to switch to Linux because emulation of Windows is a huge pain in the ass.  However, many applications that people think that they need when switching over to Linux, are not needed because there usually are suitable alternative applications.

I'd put XP, Vista or ReactOS on here, but it's a small 60GB HDD (I really should upgrade it...), &amp; I constantly fill it up w/ anime or Doctor Who, burn it to DVD, then do the same again...

<br />Right, but Mac OS is crappy for the same reason Linux is crappy: it's not Windows. IMO Mac OSX supersedes Linux, but unlike most Linux boxes, Macs are not cheap.
<br />
<br />It all really depends on your priorities. Here is my opinion:
<br />
<br />Money - Linux &gt; Windows &gt; Mac
<br />Software selection - Windows &gt; Mac &gt; Linux
<br />Stability - Mac &gt; Linux &gt; Windows
<br />Aesthetics - Mac &gt; Windows &gt; Linux
<br />Peripherals - Windows &gt; Mac &gt; Linux
<br />Performance - Linux &gt; Windows &gt; Mac
<br />Power user options - Linux &gt; Windows &gt; Mac
<br />Intuitiveness - Windows &gt; Mac &gt; Linux
<br />
<br />
<br />Linux is ugly and clunky, but it has huge potential if more people were willing to adopt it and it's users were sometimes willing to pay for software. It's just not there yet, and won't be for a long time, if ever. 
<br />
<br />Windows is slow, bloated and crashy and it's only getting worse since MS wants everyone adopt C# and .NET. Windows however has the best programs under the sun.
<br />
<br />Mac OSX is sickenly user-friendly and graphically frivolous, which is Apple  overcompensating for poor 3rd party support. Since OSX is based on BSD, you should be able to use a lot of POSIX software with it however.
<br />
<br />-----------------
<br />
<br />As far as game development, there is no alternative to Windows IMO if you're interfacing with hardware such as CopyNES.
<br />
<br />Good console emulators are available for Linux/Mac, but the selection is weaker than Windows and Windows releases are usually given priority.
<br />
<br />If you need an OS for a secondary PC which will primarily be used for web browsing, by all means go Linux; it's free and you don't have to worry about spyware. Linux also great as a dedicated server OS. But otherwise do you want to have to always find opensource programs or write your own?
<br />
<br />Probably the only other redeeming quality of Linux is that it's great at keeping other people in your household from using your computer.

<br />Yes I've heard how ugly Linux could be, and in fact I love ugly looking computer, and I cannot stand nicely animated buttons, etc... I love computing, I don't like have a coputer thinks he have to tell me what I do with it.
<br />Since I mainly use emulators, hex editors, graphics editors, and don't want to investigate ridiculous cash just for a computer, I will most proably never have a mac. In fact I'm fine with Windows, my main beef with it is that it takes a long time to boot and to shut down, and that it sometimes has glitches (altrough by far not as often as some linux hardcore people seems to say, W2k is much stabler than all other Windows I ever tried). I'm just interested in trying something else. But yes I have learn how hard it may be to have Linux support your hardware (graphic cards, etc...) and how painfull it can be to learn to use it (but I heard it improved a lot those years).
<br />
<br />All those different distributions and graphics core are confusing me a lot, but I guess I will have to try that Unbutu thing in a while (as long as I can try install it without ruining the Windows part of my PC).
