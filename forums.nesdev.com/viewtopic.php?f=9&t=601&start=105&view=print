<br />everything seems to work great.  Most of my problems seem to have been from bad connections.
<br />at this point I would say this is a universal fix for any front loading NES with a RGB mod to enable powerpak compatibility
<br />
<br />I tried a duo ppu mod Rgb/composite+RF.
<br />For the most part I piggy backed both PPUs then I select the ppu I want by supplying it with 5V from a switch.
<br />I was also going to use a rgb led for the power led.  If I am in rgb mode it will light up blue and red for composite video mode.
<br />I Had everything working but it added more vertical lines/noise.
<br />I went back just used the RGB PPU to minimize the vertical lines. 
<br />
<br />A funny /dangerous /stupid thing I did was piggy back both with PPUs to see what would happen.
<br />I got no video but the sound would still play but it was playing very fast.
<br />
<br />After playing around I noticed older v4 NES systems have more vertical line noise in the image than the ver 7 NES.
<br />this is something to consider when RGB modding a NES. 
<br />Games run from the powerpak display vertical lines more intensely.

<br />I took a pair of needle-nose piles and was able to remove the screws, Then, I took my dremel and cut them to turn them into standard screws.

<br />Do I have to cut the video because I may still want to use the RF in the future, (even if it still has bad video.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello, I have successful did this mod on my NES2 with perfect results.  I also did the Stereo mod at the same time and mange to get every thing to fit really nice.  I have written a very detailed guide using “Autoplay Media Studio” It’s a AIO program that is very easy to use just download and open.  Then follow the instructions on your screen. I have included lots and lots of very detailed pictures and a parts and tool list of every thing you need to do this.  Tips and detailed instruction for every step in this mod.  I tried to make the guide Idiot Proof.  This guide is written more for the amateur / beginner.  This guide has everything from harvesting the Need component parts from the NES 1 toaster to building the Video Amp board and even mounting the RCA or 3.5 Jack.
<br />
<br />It is 7.51 MB file size mainly due to the Detailed Pictures taking up that space.
<br />Download here: Removed because no one used it and it expired!! Use the NON AIO link instea its still good 
<br />
<br /><strong>BOTH FILES ARE SAFE AND ARE THE SAME JUST ONE ISN"T A AIO</strong>
<br />
<br />Due to some False Antivirus reports because its a self contained encrypted archive .exe. I have now released a NON AIO version you can (Just download it&gt; Unzip it&gt; Open folder&gt; And open autorun.exe. 
<br />
<br />DOWNLOAD NON AIO HERE: <a href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/k21bpm" class="postlink">http://www.sendspace.com/file/k21bpm</a>
<br />
<br /><strong>BOTH PROGRAMS DO THE SAME THING AND ARE BOTH SAFE</strong>
<br />Sample Pictures below of this guide:

<br />
<br />Thanks dmt, this is a very cool contribution.  I purchased my NES2 on ebay a few years back at quite a premium, so I have been hesitant to modify it.  But you've got me curious, I hate the vertical stripes!
<br />
<br />Edit: Just downloaded, and Clamwin is claiming the .exe is infected with "Trojan.Qhost-165".  I'm suspicious of anything delivered in executable format, I'll run it on my Linux box where things are safe.
<br />
<br />Edit 2: Ran it under Wine without any issues, the material looks good.  Maybe Clamwin is being over-protective.  I would prefer a more standard format, like the wiki, but thank you for your contribution.

<br />RE: Trojan Qhost-165:
<br />
<br />I wrote this program using AutoPlay Media Studio 6 It compress the data in a AIO (All in one file self contaied.exe) and encrypted it.  Many anti virus softwares are being over protected of their user and trowing a false report simple because it can't be for sure Is just being predigest towards my file.  I wrote it on my PC and I asure you there is NO VIRUS OR SPYWARE.  How ever Check my post I will update with a second link for a NON AIO and maybee that will fix the false report.  Thanks for your Help on this mater.
<br />
<br />UPDATE I just tested the NON AIO with "Clamwin" and it did throw the "Trojan Qhost-165" Bogus waring so I built the NON AIO and it scanned free with "Clamwin".  Might if I get time post this info on a website or wiki.

<br />
<br />Well, if and when I get time I might do a page on Wiki .  The .exe work as well to ya know and its complete safe and 100% compatible to run on any system.    If you truely dont trust me or my program download <a href="http://www.sandboxie.com" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com</a> and run it in there.....but wait its a .exe file too........oh no.   I rereleased a NON Compressed non encrypted  AIO file that has passed Clamwin and every other Antivirus program please use that one.  I assure you both programs are safe.

<br />
<br />Interesting mod instructions.
<br />
<br />I assume that FC2 is a small Ferrite Core/Bead (FC = Ferrite Core?), I can buy these at an electronics supplier for approximately $0.20c, they look identical to your picture.
<br />
<br />Do you have the part number of the transistor Q1? (Q = Transistor).
<br />
<br />If that can be sourced, an original model NES would not need to be sacrificed for the sake of one component.
<br />
<br />Regards.

<br />I don't know if you can find a sub for Q1 or not.  I am not a expert at electronics like the others on here are Im just a beginner- novice who was able to do this great mod with the help of the user on here and shared what worked for me in a guide.  If you find a sub for Q1 please report back and I can add it to the guide.  I bought my Losse NES 1 for only $5 bucks at my local Flea Market.  He's got a stack of them for only $5 each so it wasn't to heart breaking to rip one apart for me.  But I do understand who it could be for some.  So report back.  Thanks for your Input

<br />
<br />No, you don't need to get parts from a NES1 to do this mod.  
<br />The NES2 alredy has the 2 parts you are looking for. 
<br />
<br />The video amplification transistor, (marked as Q1 in the NES2) is a 2SA937. It is the same transistor they used in the NES1.  There is also a ferrite core in the NES2, but it is hidden by the heat sink of the voltage regulator, so most people don't know it's even there. 
<br />
<br />Additionally, you need to understand that this mod, doesn't remove all of the banding from a TV, just most of it.  Primarily because it doesn't address the underlying problems of the system.  An interference pattern whih primary frequency of about 600kHz

<br />What are these underlying problems, exactly? Just the design of the PPU and video circuitry in general? My AV Famicom even has some vertical lines, albeit much fainter than the NES2's.

<br />And have you confirmed that it will work harvesting the Q1 from the NES2 leaving the open circuit and still be able to work?

<br />As for the lines I don't see any after doing this mod it looks very clean and sharp.  I was so bugged by the old lines on my NES2 I refused to play games on it and used my NES1 untill I did this mod now the picture is very clear.  I own 2 NES 2 right now one with this mod and one that isn't moded yet.  When I get a TV capture card on my PC I will take some screen shots of before and after and post them.  I tried a Digtal camera but it didn't work to good taking picture of the screen.
<br />Thanks for your Help and Input.  As soon as you confirm that remvoing the Q1 from the NES2 and re use it on the video amp board then I will at it to my guide.

<br />
<br />The part are used for the video circuit so taking them for building an alternative video circuit is not a problem.
<br />
<br />In other word, Yes it is confirmed to work.
