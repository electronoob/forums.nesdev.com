<br />One of the circuit boards allows loading SNES ROMs from an SD card onto a real SNES.  It is the board labeled "SNES Romulator".

<br />
<br />-power on to the BIOS, register to switch to emulation RAM and unmap the following registers
<br />-decode the emulation SRAMs, register for SRAM limiting
<br />-decode save RAM, register to select Lo/HiROM map
<br />-register to shift A15-A21 to A16-A22 for LoROM
<br />-registers for SD interface
<br />
<br />The hard part is getting SD interfacing information and writing the FAT code.

<br />
<br />kyuusaku: you got it down pretty much exactly. The only detail missing is the 4MB of RAM is on a separate bus (since its 3.3v).  You are right about the schematic, its trivial compared to the CPLD and menu program.
<br />
<br />The CPLD acts in between the SNES and the RAM, allowing it to take over and write directly to the RAM while the menu program is running from flash. This is the only way to load games without being unbearably slow. Now it takes just a few seconds.
<br />
<br />SD interface is really simple, although it was difficult to find the datasheet for. Its basically an 8 bit shift register, with software sending commands and receiving data.
<br />
<br />Writing the menu program in assembly was a pain, so there is no FAT filesystem at all. I put all the ROMs in one huge file with list data in front of it.
<br />
<br />The whole thing was wayyy too much work <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />Any other questions about this? 
<br />
<br />We will be releasing a new product on MashMods soon, a SNES FLASH CART and a nice USB programmer/reader to go with it.

<br />
<br />Yes, precisely. Much, much more valuable to have a cart that takes memory cards, rather than requiring custom USB flashing software (which probably only works on older copies of Windows.)
<br />
<br />I'd be very interested in picking one up as well, assuming it is reasonably priced [~$50-120 or so]. Always looking to expand my available options for running code on real hardware.
<br />
<br />So far, I have two copiers and an awesome controller &lt;&gt; serial interface + SRAM cart from blargg. A memory-card flash cart would be great for the latter ... could make a much larger boot ROM with lots of fancy options, and no risk of SRAM loss when yanking the cart out while its running (only a ~0.1% chance now thanks to a 10-frame x ~100 DMA loop.)
<br />
<br />Would also be nice if someone sold RGB modded SNES units that can stream that data to a PC for analysis (eg to work on a pixel-level PPU emulator), but I'll keep dreaming ;)

<br />
<br />The USB programmer is really nice, and will work on any version of windows (uses an FTDI chip). Plus you can back up regular carts and their save RAM, or copy a save from an emulator to the real cart.
<br />
<br />With a flash cartridge you get an authentic retro experience <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Only one game means you will actually play it, versus 700 you will never play. You could use it for hacks of fullsize games, or translations.
<br />
<br />I haven't determined a final price, but it will be affordable. I will defiantly post a thread when its done (just have to figure out mass producing).
<br />
<br />Whats this about BIOSes and DMA?

<br />Does it use a non-generic kernel-level driver? If so, it won't work with 64-bit Windows Vista or later unless the publisher of the driver buys a $200/year code signing certificate. That's cost-prohibitive unless you're mass-producing the hardware that goes with it.

<br />
<br />Sorry, I was explaining what I'd use it for (reverse engineering); though I'm well aware I'm quite outside of the norm there.
<br />
<br />Ah well. As it stands, it sounds like a good product; but it doesn't offer anything Tototek hasn't already with their Super Flash Cart. But since they're out of stock anyway, and because we can never have too much homebrew stuff, it still has plenty of merit.
<br />
<br />Best wishes with the product!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Tepples, the DS devices stream the data off the SD card. The SNES requires it be loaded into RAM first to be fast enough, so that must be what he means.
<br />
<br />cybertron, if the RAM and extra chips wouldn't fit in a normal cartridge, why not just make the cartridge bigger? Backup devices say on the top of the SNES and were pretty big, no one seemed to mind that. Infact I think it looks cool. So you could certainly just make the cartridge taller or make something in the shape of a backup unit. 
<br />
<br />As byuu was saying, a SNES cartridge that loaded ROMs off SD or CF cards would be totally awesome. While I can see your point of people having a million roms on a card they never play and such, the idea has already been tested in the NES with the PowerPAK and the result was pure awesomeness. Such a product for SNES would be equally if not even more awesome. So you might want to consider the idea again.
<br />
<br />I do agree with byuu though that your Flash Cart will be very welcomed. While the NES is great and all, I think the SNES needs more loving. More products like this are a good thing.

<br />What DS devices? I'm talking about devices that are compatible with software for the Game Boy Advance platform. Like NES, Game Boy, Super NES, and N64 Game Paks, GBA Game Paks have a word-addressed ROM. The GBA adapters that take SD cards copy up to 32 MB from the SD card into a RAM on the adapter, just like PowerPak copies games from the CF to its RAM. CycloDS miniSD is one of these; others include SuperCard and M3. Are you thinking of SLOT-1 adapters such as R4, SuperCard DS One, M3 Real, and CycloDS Evolution, which use a block-addressed microSD card to simulate the <a href="http://pineight.com/ds/block/" class="postlink">block-addressed ROM</a> of a DS Game Card?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I checked Digikey and I can get 1Mx16 SRAM chips. So basically 2 chips instead of one flash. Plus a huge CPLD to take care of all the bus stuff. So basically I probably could fit it in a normal cartridge. It would still take a while to design, but could possibly be my next project.
<br />
<br />I checked the FTDI website, and it looks like they do have drivers for Vista x64, and linux. I love FTDI chips, they are so easy to use. It even has the oscillator built in so there are no external components.
<br />
<br />Tototek has the advantage of more then one game, but I think USB makes mine more accessible. Modern computers don't have parallel ports (that work).
<br />
<br />Right now im taking apart old sports games to steal their CIC and case. Bunnyboy made his own cases, and uses Kevtris's Ciclone. I don't know how many games I can find to take apart <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
