<br />
<br />I'm using this version: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.retrousb.com/downloads/POWERPAK132103.zip">http://www.retrousb.com/downloads/POWERPAK132103.zip</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />EDIT: Bleh, my bad, it always tries to load info if START is pressed on intro screen, any other key goes to the menu. Although I must say some of these UI choices are not to my taste. =)

<br />
<br />Full name display probably isn't happening, would need far too many boot ROM changes.
<br />
<br />Hiding the '.' folder also won't happen, and one reason has been mentioned.  It helps with the TV safe area  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Moving the cursor might be a possibility.

<br />I fully agree.
<br />Also, if the SNES PowerPak could play SPC it would be a NICE touch, and if the Power Pak NSF player would support extra audio it would be great as well (I tried the music of CV3 and Gimmick japanese by their respective sound tests).

<br />
<br />You'd have to start being like Pro Action Replay and hooking a routine like the NMI routine to do that which would break compatibility with certain games. Besides is it that hard to press the reset button?

<br />Same MMC3 has been used starting with v1.3, nothing about it was changed for the last few versions.  Is there a previous version that works for you?

MMC5 stopped working too. He didn't remember exactly what versions of the menu and mappers he was using, but he mentioned something about having used loopy's mappers at one point. Do you want me to try anything like the following procedure next time I have access to his CF card?
<br />
<br />1. Delete the /powerpak/ folder.
<br />2. Reinstall a given version of the menu and mappers.
<br />3. Photograph the screen of each affected game.

I save, then go to check in the menu screen and nothing has been saved. This is with 8 different dumps, including a known good one. Perhaps the two issues are somehow connected? Does anyone else encounter this issue?
<br />It's not an issue with saving in general, as all my other games save fine, both in game and on the Powerpak.
<br />I'm thinking something small might have been changed with this mapper release, and perhaps Crystalis does something unusual that has caused this? (or maybe it never worked at all?)
