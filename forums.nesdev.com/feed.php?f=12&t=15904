Programmable pipeline with display lists, fpu, perspective texture correction in hardware and 4MBs with fast transfer from Cart makes the N64 at lot easier to balance, just trying to pack movie and audio and games into 64MB is pain <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />But to make an N64 game you had to pay for 1 million carts before Nintendo would publish it, this acted as a quality barrier, as the company had to be confident of selling said 1 million carts. Sony wooed devs with we can do runs of 50,000 if you want. So things like Vib Ribbon could be done on PS1 but not N64, this is why the PS1 becomes a glut for shovelware, Sony would do low runs, CDs were cheap, Sony wanted devs all the devs, while Nintendo were ivory tower elitists who would tell you to get stuffed ( still are I guess )<br />Having the cheap CD format for the SNES at the end of its life with such mentality would have been interesting, but I guess it is no different from the Flash Cart system they had in Japan for the SNES but by then most had moved on. <br /><br />the PSP was mostly sane baring one strange omissions from its fixed pipeline, dest colour blend? dest stencil? and the square button <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> Oh and the 90 degrees LCDs on the 2000,3000 models that gave red and blue lines on everything... or the PSP Go with no UMD drive...... hmmm<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8250">Oziphantom</a> — Fri May 12, 2017 12:56 am</p><hr />

What the Atari Jaguar, Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64, and PlayStation 2 have in common is a separate core to run the vertex shader and feed the blitter. This is Tom for the Jaguar, the second SH-2 for the Saturn, the Reality Signal Processor (RSP) for the Nintendo 64, and the Emotion Engine's vector units (VU0 and VU1) for the PlayStation 2. Back then, a programmable vertex processor was a new and unfamiliar thing, and multicore in general had largely been used for audio, which is generally less tightly coupled than graphics. Developers at the time had an easier time wrapping their heads around the more fixed-function vertex processing in the original PlayStation's Geometry Transformation Engine (GTE).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu May 11, 2017 10:26 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Memblers wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I could be wrong, but my impression was that Nintendo ditched this design and Sony, so maybe Nintendo also realized that it sucked and intended to release a different CD-ROM system (which obviously was also cancelled).  It's a fascinating bit of history, but seems like an odd choice to want to reproduce.  Sorry I don't have a link for it, but I remember seeing Nintendo docs that were leaked about the CD-ROM system and it didn't look like the discovered Playstation at all.  Much more RAM, 21mhz 32-bit RISC CPU, 65C02.  Seemed like the doc had a decent amount of info (I think it was mostly about the CD-ROM data formats and how to load), but I was a little annoyed that it never said what that 32-bit CPU was exactly.<br /></div>The story goes, it was all done, and good to go. Then Yamaguchi reads the contract, which had a clause that says Sony gets control over what is published on the platform and all the licenses etc are approved by Sony. Basically so Sony steals the SNES. Yamaguchi flips the tea table. <br /><br />Sony then takes it, bolts on the other components and launches the PS1, as basically they wanted in on the games market. Sony's biggest worry was Yamaguchi would be so vengeful that he would use the stock piles of cash Nintendo had, to buy up the PS1s in Japan and but them in a warehouse and that would have killed Sony.
