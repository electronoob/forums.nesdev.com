Does anyone know of any 3rd party mapper updates or why RetroZone isn't supporting Powerpak updates right now?

<br />
<br />Scratch that.  It is actually stage 15, not stage 14.
<br />
<br />Yes, it is the PRG0 version.  The bug only happens in a specific area of stage 15, i.e., where you have to run to the left with knights and those flying medusa heads coming at you.  It seems as though the lockup occurs when too many things are going on at the same time.
<br />
<br />Are you sure that the PRG1 version doesn't have this bug?  I've never played through the NES Castlevania games, and I wanted to start from the beginning.  Are there Game Genie codes for starting at specific stages?  I'd prefer to just start at stage 14 so that I can knock Castlevania 1 off my list of games that I have yet to complete.

<br />Positive. I've never encountered it on my PRG1 cart.
<br />
<br />For some reason, I usually encountered the bug in the area <em>before</em> the hallway with knights and Medusa heads, after climbing the left staircase. Did the status bar disappear or shift left/right when it locked up on you?

<br />
<br />Yeah.  It doesn't happen with high probability.  I leave my NES on for days at a time, because I've yet to beat stage 15 without cheating and I only play 15 minutes or so at a time.  It seems as though after about 10 times going through that stage, a lockup will occur.

<br />
<br />That's a very serious accusation to make.  In the US, mail fraud is a federal offense.  Don't jump to conclusions.  So the questions are, did you wait long enough (how long)?  Did you get a tracking number?  And was the package insured?
<br />
<br />Clearly, most people don't seem to have problems getting their stuff.
