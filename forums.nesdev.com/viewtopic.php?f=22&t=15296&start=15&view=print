Make an object system, and have collision data as well as meta sprite data as just attributes of that object. The object itself has X/Y coords. All other X/Y positions inside the object are <em>relative </em>to the main object coords.

A mismatch between these two is what's causing the hit detection to be percieved as off/misguiding in relation to what you see on screen.

On Wednesday of last week began this crowdfunding and seven days later we already have 1. 167 € raised; a third part.<br /><br />From the retroNES Software team we could not be happier.

In addition, the doors between screens were functional, and it was even thought to develop parts both outside and inside within the same level.<br /><br />On the upper left side you will see a series of indicators in pink. The first one told us which room we were in, the second one told us how many enemies there were in the room, and the third one told us what state was the animation of the sprite of Rulo.<br /><br />As curiosity you will see the box object, that could be pushed and even interacted with the enemies.<br /><br />You can also see that at first it was thought of the way the enemies did damage, pushing Rulo to one side. Discarded by problems with the collision of walls.<br /><br />The music that sounds belongs to @dougeff game that he used in one of his many development tutorials for the NES.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUmYlvHNYCk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUmYlvHNYCk</a><!-- m -->
