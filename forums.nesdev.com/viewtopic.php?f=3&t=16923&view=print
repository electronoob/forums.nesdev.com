		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I stumbled upon a couple of FDS games that do something that seems weird while waiting for a disk to be inserted:<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">loop:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; LDA $4032&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; AND #$01&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; BEQ loop&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;if a disk is currently inserted, loop (e.g wait for eject)<br />&nbsp; LDA $4032&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; AND #$01&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; BNE loop&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;if no disk is currently inserted, loop (e.g wait for insert, but the loop goes back to the first check!)</div><br />And then others do this instead (which makes a lot more sense to me):<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">wait_eject_loop:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; LDA $4032&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; AND #$01&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; BEQ wait_eject_loop&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; LDY #$FF&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; JSR Delayms&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />wait_insert_loop:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; LDA $4032&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; AND #$01&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; BNE wait_insert_loop</div>As far as I can tell, the first version can fail to recognize the newly inserted disk pretty often (which would force the user to eject the disk and then reinsert it).  This can happen if you the &quot;drive is empty&quot; bit gets cleared while the code is in the first part of the loop (which loops until the disk is ejected).<br /><br />My 6502 assembly skills are pretty terrible, so I could be understanding this wrong, but I can actually get this behavior several times in a row in the games (Aspic, Ao no Senritsu) that use the first version (e.g doing eject disk -&gt; wait -&gt; insert disk causes the execution to go back to the first loop and the game doesn't react at all)<br /><br />The only way the first version would &quot;reliably&quot; be able to exit its loop was if the value of the &quot;drive is empty&quot; bit quickly toggled between 0 and 1 a number of times when physically ejecting or inserting a disk?

This was something that was fixed in nestopia before by martin, under better disc drive emulation. It takes multiple times to get this game to load as a lot of the time ejecting/inserting the disk does nothing.

The <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/FDS_RAM_adaptor_cable_pinout" class="postlink">Wiki's pinout</a> says it's low when &quot;media set&quot; at least when coming in to the RAM adapter.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Briefly looking around for videos of people disassembling the drive itself, I think I see a big normally-closed switch on the side with yellow wires (that is opened by inserting a disk). But the people who uploaded the videos also comment on there being multiple switches inside (there's obviously also the limit switches for seeking to end and beginning), so I'm not certain if I'm both seeing that big one correctly and if it's also the one that detects insertion.

I think in subsequent versions martin may have overwrote these fixes in fds since he obviously made many fixes to fds.cpp since then. <br /><br />Here's a snippet from the changelog for that version:<br /><br />* More accurate FDS disk drive emulation. Fixes &quot;Aspic-Majaou no Noroi&quot;, &quot;Hao Kun no Fushigina Tabi&quot; and possibly others.
