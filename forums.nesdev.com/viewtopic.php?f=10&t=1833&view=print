		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was wondering if you guys could give me some direction on updating name tables for the storyline that I want to be seen before the main title screen of the game is displayed.  Can I populate the name table, wait for the user to press A (once they've read the information), turn off the PPU, update the name table with the new information, wait for the player to press A, etc,etc.  Is that doable and a proper way of updating the name table?  What do you guys suggest.
<br />
<br />Thanks.

<br />
<br />The way you want to do it sounds fine.  I would add "wait for vblank" in there.
<br />
<br />if user presses A:
<br />wait for vblank
<br />disable PPU
<br />draw screen
<br />wait for vblank
<br />enable PPU
<br />
<br />If you don't wait before turning it on, the screen will jump.
<br />
<br />It's also kinda fun to have delays between writing the characters of the text.. I did that in an unreleased thing and it was pretty cool.  I made a little table of subtly varying delays it goes through, so it looks kinda like someone is typing it. heheh

<br />Yeah fade-ins and fade-outs do sound really cool.  I'm not sure where to start especially since I can't get my darn background to display properly <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Maybe you should use the good old "wait for VBlank" in the intro, and use NMI's in the game itself. Of course you could use the NMI for everything, just jump to the desired routine (depending on what part of the game you are - title screen, intro, in game) in the begining of it (you can use a jump table for that).
<br />
<br />As for the fade-ins and outs, I think you can mess with the high digit of each color. When the high digit is at it's maximum allowed value (3), colors are very bright, and when it's 0, the colors are very dark. For a fade-in from black, right after the black screen you can set the palette with the desired hues, but all with low brightness (high digit 0). Then, every few frames (or it'll be too fast, the NES does not have many colors), you increase the brightness of the colors until you reach the desired brightness of each one. Of course, some colors will get there first (the darkest ones), but I don't think that'll ruin the effect.

<br />It looks like he's doing it the right way (that is, he's not polling $2002).  He's just waiting for an NMI to trip and set his flag in RAM -- nothing wrong with that.

<br />I only polled $2002 @ startup (polled, cleared OAM, polled).  Everything else after I used the flag in RAM.

<br />
<br />
<br />Yes I did.  Thanks for asking.  However, using the code I posted above, my tiles show up @ the top of the screen (instead of $2140 which is where I'm setting my name table to). It acts as if I'm setting the NT to $2000. The funny thing is in nintendulator's name table viewer shows the tiles show up in the right position.  Just not in the actual execution window. It's probably something I'm overlooking ... just good to have another pair of eyes to see it.
<br />
<br />Thanks.

<br />
<br />You need to reset the $2006 register after writing also.  Set it to $0000 or $2000.  Usually I do that in the NMI code, but then you need to be careful when doing VRAM updates outside of the NMI routine (disable NMI first, or have that part of NMI skipped, so it doesn't interrupt your writing).
<br />
<br />Otherwise it draws the background starting at whatever address $2006 was left at.

Don't do it in your NMI handler unless your NMI handler is handling all the drawing.

<br />
<br />Nope.  IIRC, the vertical scroll value doesn't take effect until the 2nd $2006 write.
<br />
<br />In programs that change vertical scrolling mid-screen you'll see writes like this (ignoring loads):
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;sta $2006<br />&nbsp;sta $2005<br />&nbsp;sta $2005<br />&nbsp;sta $2006<br /></div>
