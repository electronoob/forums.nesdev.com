<br />I like his music particularly due to his ability to take pre-existing themes and twist them into bigger compositions and varieties. The only downfall is that his music was mainly featured in some pretty mediocre games. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />Back in my hayday, I was a fan of Thomas Mogensen (Drax), and a lot of the stuff Vibrants did. Thomas specifically had a pretty nice jazzy style that I identified with fairly well. Most of this was in Denmark though, so these are European composers. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> However, despite being European, I don't remember much techno-style music.

<br />But then listen to all the K.K. songs in Animal Crossing to hear how much Mr. Totaka's range can vary.

<br />
<br />What does the music in NES RPGs sound like? Are they eastern, western, or have elements of both? How are composers like Nobou Uematsu and Koichi Sugiyama organized/treated?
