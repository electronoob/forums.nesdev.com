		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Having been annoyed by Windows 10's bloatware, I've wanted to change OSes for a long time, but it dawned upon me don't really know what I should get. Many people like Linux, but I have enough Windows exclusive software that I'm not interested in switching. The obvious answer then would be Windows 7, but is there any reason for not going back to 64 bit XP if you don't care about say, Windows Aero? The concern seems to stem from Microsoft no longer doing security updates, but I always have everything backed up and use Killdisk if I get a bad virus, which almost never happens anyway, so I'm not concerned. Lack of compatibility with newer programs would probably be a far bigger issue...

So... Even though I do not enjoy much windows 10, we are stuck with it.<br /><br />If you just want windows, don't mind not connecting to the internet then I would go back to windows XP just for the performance boost but many tools I'm using wouldn't work so I'm stuck. Wouldn't mind 1 isolated xp machine though for basic stuff.

However if you want a &quot;modern XP&quot; there is ReactOS which is a free open source reinterpretation of XP and runs most XP stuff fine. Just don't expect any new tools too work for you. <br /><br />7 is not bad. <br />8.1 (the .1 is vital ) is better than 7

It really saddens me that we likely won't ever get that kind of performance from a current OS, since the bloat increases at the same rate as the hardware becomes more powerful...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's a good tip. There's the usual problem with localized names for settings. I use the english version precisely for that reason, but if i'm on an installation set to swedish, good luck to me finding anything in the settings, haha. I assume it's the same for other localizations. <br /><br />One thing that annoys me a lot occasionally with the explorer search is that &quot;view as&quot; settings for each catalog is stored separately for plain view and when in search mode. So if you've set your catalog to &quot;list&quot; or &quot;details&quot;, it will load the default value of &quot;large icons&quot; when searching, unless you've changed it manually at some point for that folder while in search mode at the same time. If anything, a search ought to be defaulted to a condensed detailed list so the result is easy to browse and sort. Or just store a unified view mode setting regardless search mode...<br /><br />There's also some UX annoyances with folders containing over some thresholds' worth of sound files, but i think that's been there for quite long.

You can filter out Windows Update, Windows Store, etc<br /><br />You can also dual boot if necessary.<br /><br />There is also Wine, although you will have to see if the programs you want are compatible. (Sometimes there are also alternative programs that can do similar thing, e.g. LibreOffice.)

Even if XP or 7 buys you a few years, eventually shit hits the fan and you're again faced with the same choice. Then it might be 10 or the current, top of the line, monthly fee-having spymaster, but I believe that you won't be able to install &quot;just 10&quot; anymore. Start weaning yourself to a Free OS.
