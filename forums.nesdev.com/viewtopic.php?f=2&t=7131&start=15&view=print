<br />
<br />
<br />And as for a destructible map, I was thinking of a clone on Miner Dig Deep on Xbox 360, how it could be done on NES with saving a huge map. You could fit a pretty large map ON NES in RAM if you use SXROM with 32K SRAM. You could also hack up the board with a couple wires to use a 1MB ROM for your program, 32K switchable SRAM and CHR-RAM for graphics. Heck, you can use a 512K ROM with 64MB SRAM if you hacked it in even more. I thought of this with MMC1, since scanline on MMC3 means nothing to me as I am not good enough to use it yet, so MMC1 is what I looked at this with. And thats pushing the MMC1 to it's limit. Now looking at SXROM right now it seems as if what I said isn't possible, but shouldn't it be possible if your used CHR-RAM in 8K mode?
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />
<br />Would this work for wiring MMC1 pins to make it 32K battery back WORKRAM, 1MBROM?
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">MMC1 PIN=====Chip Pin<br />PRG A14 =====Rom A14<br />PRG A15 =====Rom A15<br />PRG A16 =====Rom A16<br />PRG A17 =====Rom A17<br />CHR A12 =====Rom A18<br />CHR A13 =====Rom A19<br />CHR A14 =====Rom A20<br />CHR A15 =====WORK-RAM A14<br />CHR A16 =====WORK-RAM A15<br /></div>
<br />
<br />I am not good at figuring out this electornics stuff yet, but it seems to make sense? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I think this setup would be something you might want to look into. It needs a little re-wiring of boards, but it offers a TON of extra hardware, especially the 32K WRAM. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />
<br />But it's true what they say, if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.  Maybe RetroZone could and will, but I wouldn't stake my project on it.  On the PowerPak even with an FPGA, MMC3 doesn't work right..
<br />
<br />I came up with a CPLD mapper design that is better than MMC1 (maybe between MMC1 and MMC3 in terms of flexibility - great features but no IRQ counter), and uses a CPLD with half the resources that the MMC1 ReproPak uses.  It should be a bit cheaper.  I'm sure the efficiency was helped by me not cloning an existing design.  I still need to make a board for it though, just another one of my many projects.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When deciding between UNROM/UOROM and MMC1 (SNROM), the big differences are that SNROM has switchable mirroring and SRAM. The MMC1's switchable mirroring is helpful for games that scroll one direction at a time (e.g. Mega Man 2, The Legend of Zelda), and the MMC1's one-screen mode makes status bars easier to make steady in a 4-way free-scrolling game at the cost of a few attribute artifacts on the right side. SRAM is helpful if your game has more than one chapter and you want to save more than 32 bits of state from one session to the next (e.g. any RPG). Battle Kid could use UOROM because it doesn't scroll and its state fits in 32 bits.

<br />
<br />I've had issues with MMC3 games not saving WRAM (and yeah it was the iNES header).  There could be other problems, but there also different versions, I've only tried the official mapper pack, so far.
<br />
<br />IMHO, the MMC3's IRQ behavior is pretty complex for it being relatively crappy, compared to other possible IRQ methods.
<br />
<br />If you do end up needing a custom board, I can make one maybe.

Well, if you need to move lots of blocks around instead of simply destroying them, they would need far too much RAM for their coordinates, so you're better off storing the whole map in the extra 8KB of RAM.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'm pretty sure I'm going to want a status bar. But from what I understand I can use a sprite 0 hit if I don't have scanline IRQs. Is that correct?</div><br />If you don't have IRQs, status bars are much easier to make when they are at the top of the screen, rather than the bottom. If it stays at the top, showing it is just a matter of detecting the end of VBlank (which can be done by waiting for the sprite hit flag to be cleared) and then waiting for a sprite hit to indicate the end of the status bar.<br /><br />If the status bar is at the bottom however, guaranteeing a sprite hit can be hard when you also scroll vertically, because you can't be sure that a solid pixel in the sprite will hit a solid pixel in the background. Also, if by any chance your frame calculations take longer than usual (if there are too many objects on the screen for example), you might miss the sprite hit, which will cause the status bar to be drawn at the wrong place (or not at all) for a frame, so it will appear to be jumping.<br /><br />So, if you are not using IRQs, I strongly suggest you place your status bar at the top, and use 1-screen mirroring, so that one name table can be dedicated to the gameplay while the other is dedicated to the status bar. Using 1-screen mirroring will allow you to make levels taller than 2 screens while using a status bar, something that's pretty much impossible with other kinds of mirroring.<br /><br />You will have some scrolling glitches at the side(s) of the screen though, unless you mask them with sprites. I'm not aware of any way to have a status bar and glitch-free 8-way scrolling that doesn't involve one or more of the following: sprites, 4-screen mirroring, IRQs and MMC5.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Out of curiosity what mapper, and how much RAM is Battle Kid?</div><br />AFAIK, mapper 2 with 256KB of PRG-ROM, CHR-RAM, no extra RAM.

<br />I'm OK with this kind of scanline counter too. PAL compatibility is overrated, because it's not like scanline counting is the only thing in the way of region compatibility... You also have to change note tables, music tempo, delays, physics (nobody seems to go as far as changing the physics though)... So a couple of extra constants and/or tables is not such a big deal.
<br />
<br />I also like the simple approach that Memblers and tepples have suggested in the past, of firing an IRQ when a certain tile is used. This is region independent and very flexible, as you can use sprites or the background to do it. This is kinda like a "sprite 0 hit done right" IMO, because it uses IRQs instead of register polling and doesn't have that solid pixel limitation. And it can be used multiple times in the same frame.
<br />
<br />What I can't stand are the several limitations of the scanline counter of the MMC3. It forces you to give up on a feature I consider one of the best in the NES, which is being able to fetch sprite tiles from both pattern tables when using 8x16 sprites.

<br />Are you asking me? I don't like the MMC1 much, so I probably wouldn't use it, but if one wishes to publish their games through RetroZone I think it would be wise to contact them and make sure they can (and are willing to) manufacture the type of cart you need before investing your time into it.
