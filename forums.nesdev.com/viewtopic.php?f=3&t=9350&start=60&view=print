Hack an emulator or otherwise create an implementation that they can use to develop with, and finally publish a ROM that requires it before asking for a mapper allocation.<br /><br />If someone wants to directly approach maintainers of emulators and ask them to pre-emptively implement something for them, that implementer can make an evaluation about whether it's worthwhile (just like they can evaluate any part of the spec and implement it or not). It is up to the emulator author whether they would do that kind of thing. This mostly has to do with what kind of faith they might have in the person making the request, I suppose.<br /><br />My interest is that the allocation process should be clear-cut. Publish the software first, then allocate the mapper in the specification. The specification should follow existing material (i.e. this it not chicken vs. egg, the ROMs are the source and reason to implement).<br /><br />People should not be adding things to the spec in lieu of asking someone for help in hacking an emulator for their needs, or developing some kind of relationship with emulator authors. Adding your wishlist mapper to the spec is a detriment to that spec until there is some ROM that an implementer can actually run with it.

There is no way in the world to ever come up with a perfect &quot;100% all inclusive&quot; format that could account for anything ever new that showed up.   I attempted to make additions that would benefit emulator writers and for my FPGA NES.<br /><br />In fact, the spec doc I wrote is how my FPGA NES implements it.   And probably this is how it always will implement it.  I noticed on the wiki that someone came up with a whole set of extended mapper numbers for things like homebrews and hacks;  this is exactly the kind of thing I did NOT want to happen with extra mappers.  This is just another willy-nilly mapper number mess like what exists currently with the 256 we already have.<br /><br />I do not like hacks to determine what kind of mapper/ROM/etc a game is, including CRCs, ROM sizes, and other things which are not extensible to new stuff that might appear (be it more games, or homebrews, etc).   If you rely on CRCs or ROM sizes and someone hacks a game to include more levels, etc.  (or just some other kind of minor hack) it will no longer work because the ROM size changed, or the CRC changed.<br /><br />So that was the rationale for it all along- disambiguating existing stuff and with support for all the newer stuff I had ever come across up to that point.   The idea was only a few percent (say, 2-3% at most) of existing ROMs would need to be modified so they could be disambiguated.  In fact, the header was designed so if the ROM was run on a &quot;Regular&quot; emulator it'd still run as it always did.

But if the ROM size changed, then it's often supposed to go on a different board. For example, expanding a 256K SNROM game to SUROM means that at a minimum, 1. the reset code needs to be fixed carefully to clear CHR A16 if the game powers up in the second 256K, and 2. the game needs to not rely on CHR A16 disabling PRG RAM. This is why I suggested guessing SUROM, SOROM, and SXROM behavior based on memory sizes. Besides, even in &quot;submapper 0&quot;, CHR A16 is a PRG RAM disable bit only if CHR size is 8K (SNROM), not larger (SLROM).

If the header has a bad/inconsistent specification, it's just a bad ROM, and it's allowed to crash or do other stupid things.

The spec isn't telling them whether it's executing on an NES, flash cart, VM, Mac, Windows, whatever. That's entirely irrelevant to the goal of being able to specify the stuff needed to run a ROM. That's <em>their choice</em>, not mine, and not yours.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">designing things to explicitly expose pointy bits is asking for people to hurt themselves.</div><br />All of the pointy bits are put there by the implementer, not by this spec. This concern is outside the realm of what we are doing here.<br /><br /><br />Anyhow, this has gotten far too ideological. I think I have heard your argument and you have heard mine about whether MMC6 should have a submapper assignment. Argument has clearly been unconvincing for either of us. What form of authority would you suggest we defer to instead?

If there's no ROM that needs it to run, don't allocate it. This actually puts a pretty big barrier to new mapper allocation, because people aren't nearly as good at making software as they are coming up with ideas for new mappers. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> So... no allocations so far.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I guess we ought to defer to you to some extent. This is why I've tried to seek your input in #nesdev on submapper proposals.</div><br />Now that kevtris' assignments for MMC3 have been re-instated, the wiki version of the spec appears to be fully compatible with kevtris' original document, so I don't think we have a problem yet. I moved everything that was unimplementable to &quot;proposals&quot;, which cut us down to what is mostly a subset of the kevtris version.<br /><br />Here are the things we have added w.r.t. kevtris' proposal:<br /><ul><li>001:5 - fixed 32k PRG for MMC1. I haven't tested all the games yet, but it seems that in at least some cases simply initializing the PRG banks in NROM order at load is already sufficient for compatibility with submapper 0. This might even be true for all of the games?</li><li>068:1 - Sunsoft Dual Cartridge System for Nantettatte!! Baseball.</li><li>210:1 - Namco 175 specification to remove the need for heuristic detection.</li><li>210:2 - Namco 340 specification to remove the need for heuristic detection.</li></ul><br />Here are the things we have removed:<br /><ul><li>001:3 - Deprecated because this is already iNES 155.</li><li>004:2 - Not removed, but requirement for hard-wired mapping of MMC3 unclear. <em>(Any games?)</em></li><li>016:1 - Bandai FCG.</li><li>016:2 - ? <em>(No description.)</em></li><li>016:3 - ? <em>(No description.)</em></li><li>019:1 - N106 Mindseeker.</li><li>034:1 - NINA-01. <em>(Isn't Impossible Mission 2 is already compatible with 034:0?)</em></li><li>034:2 - Union Bond <em>(Does anybody know what this means?)</em></li><li>065:1 - ? <em>(Insufficient description.)</em></li><li>078:2 - Fixed vertical + WRAM. <em>(Not needed for any game? NES 2.0 lets us specify WRAM already too?)</em></li><li>080:? - Description says they were moved to mapper 207.</li><li>083:1 - Cony with 2k CHR banking.</li><li>083:2 - Cony with other modifications.</li><li>166:? - Description says it is really mapper 27.</li><li>167:1 - ? <em>(No description.)</em></li><li>188:1 - 256k PRG Karaoke ROMs.</li><li>245:1 - Flat CHR RAM.</li></ul><br />So, many of these are insufficiently described to implement. Maybe some of them can be included. By the same criteria that I outlined for allocating mappers, I think we should treat these the same.<br />1. Explain what game/ROM needs a submapper to run.<br />2. Sufficiently describe the submapper implementation.<br />3. Let someone else verify that it is needed, and the implementation works.<br />4. Allocate the submapper, and keep an eye on backward compatibility. (If kevtris already had it, don't reassign.)<br /><br />As long as we do this going forward, I don't really see a conflict with kevtris' original spec. If we don't have a known use case for one of kevtris' suggestions, there's no reason to put it in the spec (it can't be implemented until we know what it is, right?). If anybody comes up with something that needs a submapper, explain what it is and we should add it. Pretty simple.<br /><br />Anything kevtris pre-emptively added because they might be nice for homebrew can wait until that homebrew exists before we add it to the spec. The spec isn't preventing people from trying any new mapper idea they want, and it'll still be here if and when any software is made for that new mapper. The wiki is living and changing, and a central source for this, there's no need to try to guess the future here because we can easily add it when we get there.

When, not if.<br /><br />So, should we explicitly add that warning label to the submapper page?

Actually, I think this kind of stuff is a good reason to use UNIF. UNIF's goal was <em>accuracy</em> by being very specific about the hardware that it wants emulated.<br /><br />Specifying a power-on value for 32k MMC1 isn't really asking for problems at all in any practical case. There's only <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?keywords=sirom&amp;kwtype=pcb" class="postlink">two obscure games</a> that don't, and it doesn't break compatibility with them, or MMC1 games of any other size. It breaks accuracy with them in exactly the same way that emulators break accuracy with most games by initializing RAM, or a myriad of other things. This seems rather trivial and not worth specifying a submapper for. There doesn't seem to be an existing problem with running the 32k MMC1 games and the original iNES format; nobody is doing a CRC check to support them, as far as I can tell, so it seems unlikely that anyone would want to adopt that submapper to solve a problem they don't have.<br /><br />iNES' goal of compatibility rather than accuracy is actually one of its biggest strengths. It's a big reason why it was more practical to implement than UNIF. Maybe a hundred mapper implementations instead of a thousand board implementations?<br /><br />I'll put it another way, if somebody needs thorough validation tools for homebrewing, they should go ahead and build those things, but iNES is a terrible place to try and stuff all those needs. It began life as a compatibility format, and it would be a <em>colossal mess</em> to try and turn it into something that can specify every hardware quirk. You're proposing to change a format that was born for one purpose into something completely different. NES 2.0 is a compatibility patch for iNES, not a total change of direction.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The <em>default</em> implementation is not to have bus conflicts.</div><br />That is patently false. The <em>default</em> implementation DOES have bus conflicts, both in hardware, and in more recent emulators that implement these bus conflicts to keep people from hurting themselves on derivative works.</div><br />Sorry, I misstepped there. I lost track of which mappers we're talking about. For boards that have both bus-conflict and non-bus-conflict versions, no bus conflict has been the default, has it not? If all boards for a mapper had bus conflicts, then yes that is the proper default (and it should be specified in our definition/description of that mapper-- nothing to do with NES 2.0, the iNES 1 version of the mapper should do it).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">There's at least one instance documented on the wiki page for mapper 003. (as distinct from the page for CNROM)</div><br />So for mapper 3 the question should be the opposite. Are there any mapper 3 games that require <em>no</em> bus conflicts? If yes, we should propose the submapper for this. If not, we don't need it yet.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Union Bond (a developer)'s mapper seems to be oversize BNROM with PRG-RAM. I don't see why it needs a submapper.</div><br />Hmm, well if it writes values to the last 3 bytes of PRG-RAM it would conflict with the NINA-01 + BxROM mapper 34 implementation, so that could require the submapper. Anyhow, until somebody can come up with the ROM that needs it I don't think we should worry about it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, so in response to <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php?title=NES_2.0_submappers&amp;curid=852&amp;diff=11510&amp;oldid=11509" class="postlink">this change</a> allocating 3 submappers for VRC2/VRC4:<br /><ul><li>023: 8 - this one I don't understand the description of. Is this a compatibility issue for &quot;World Hero&quot;?</li><li>023: 15 - the mapper articles claim that this is already compatible with the existing PRG-RAM implementation, i.e. it's not a compatibility issue.</li><li>025: 15 - the description claims that the one extant ROM is already compatible with submapper 0. This is <em>future proofing</em> against a romhack that wants to add an IRQ? I strongly suggest that we should not do this.</li></ul>Both of 023:15 / 025:15 are clearly invalid by the criteria I think we should be using for submapper allocation, and 023: 8 has a very opaque description so I will need further clarification to understand what it is. The ROMs listed are said to be compatible already, so they're clearly not a valid test case to verify a correct submapper implementation.<br /><br />This is really digging at what I was just saying about format goals re: compatibility or accuracy. If it's not currently incompatible, it really doesn't need a submapper. We should be solving existing CRC and heuristic problems, or possibly accomodating existing romhacks. We should NOT be future proofing against potential romhacks. It's a waste of our time. (Make the romhack first! We need a test case before it's worth implementing.)<br /><br />Again, I think emulation accuracy tools for homebrewers and hackers are a wonderful thing to have and I would love to use them, but I think this is a completely different goal than NES 2.0, and should not be shoehorned into it. It seems that lidnariq and I have somewhat mutually exclusive goals here, and some consensus from others on how to proceed would be very helpful I think. I do not wish to engage in an edit war, as that will be simultaneously detrimental to both lidnariq's goals and my own.
