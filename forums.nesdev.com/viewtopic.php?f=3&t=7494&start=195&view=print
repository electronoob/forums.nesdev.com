<br />and fwiw split files (PRG+CHR) are floating around in the web since august, so it's not like there would be no way to find the correct dumps...
<br />
<br />
<br />the main differences between this new proposal and MESS approach is in the choice of separate board files vs. a central db, and in the choice of the checksums, since we only use crc32 + sha1 instead of larger hashes... (there would also be the inclusion of non-official releases, but given FitzRoy background you won't convince him to change his mind... which makes me sorry for the various Nanjing games, which are small gems despite being chinese pirates)
<br />
<br />however, I wish all the luck to FitzRoy and I hope someone will get interested in supporting proper dumps one day, no matter which format will be used <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />
<br />[1] for lack of time, I still haven't had time to add homebrew to the list (which was a common objection when I introduced the db and which has been brought up here as well), but users can manually add entries to the database by opening the nes.xml file with a text editor.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I looked at the database and have some proposals for ZapFC++:
<br />
<br />-Change (Jap) to (Jpn), the politically correct abbreviation, or better yet use Nintendo's country codes instead of languages
<br />-Remove .fc.zip from the filename field, it's implied
<br />-Use TLROM instead of HVC-TLROM-04 etc, an emulator won't necessarily have board aliases and the preservation of this data is entirely unnecessary for emulation
<br />-Remove (NTSC) and (PAL), they're implied by the region
<br />-Don't include board description strings, they're unofficial, 99% irrelevant and many of them don't even match the board/mapper in your database. The few descriptions with useful info such the Bandai SEEPROM variants should have unique boards names or a board variant column so "DRAGON BALL Z-B/24C01" for example.
<br />-Don't include CIC info (should be optional at most since it's irrelevant to NES emulation)
<br />-Don't include mirroring info, this is also implied by the board variant. Super Mario Bros would be "NROM-256/H" and games with protection diodes or other random jumpers would have their own board/board variant.
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">-Get rid of iNES mapper numbers or there's no credibility to your movement</span>, if emulators are going to hack on support they can use their own lookup table
<br />-Include a header row (in the board file too) so that the column order is flexible and can be expanded (with multiple hash types for example since people have their preferences) it also will allow unnecessary crap to be bundled in the database (and ignored)
<br />-Allow packing RAM dumps in the container so that any games with suicide data may function, and game saves may be stored/distributed analogous to a cartridge at the user's discretion
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">-Allow the use of folders as containers in addition to compressed archives</span>, this would allow ROM collections to compress better and make the format less demanding to implement on a NES itself
<br />
<br />Some big ideas I'm brewing (maybe I'll fork my own format and implementation):
<br />
<br />-Allow for arbitrary ROM filenames, the idea being that they will be named according to the silkscreen or the part/location designator. Reserve PRG and CHR for games without codes. Map board-specific ROM segments to their filenames. Hash each ROM separately. Right now your format requires joined PRG and CHR frankenfile ROMs, and not supporting arbitrary ROM loading and mapping doesn't allow for things like DSP or CIC dumps to be included or nametable ROMs.
<br />
<br />-Allow for the board file to contain multiple database rows so that multiple game revisions can packed together and revisions with the same CHR ROM for example can map to the same file.
<br />
<br />===========
<br />
<br />The format is now flexible enough to not only suit every NES game but it can suit every console and coin-operated game, all through a single auditing and management tool only understanding one format. Theoretically all platforms could use a consolidated database as well, but the DB's flatness would make it ridiculously inefficient and I/O intensive. I would use this same format for each console, only adding columns where absolutely necessary. I also propose use of the same database with CD and DVD images (each track gets its own row) creating a centralized "cuesheet" and TOC repository. For this reason I would rename the board file to &lt;insert console/disc database extension&gt;.db. Since these db fragments are exactly that, the management tool could absorb new dumps easily and dispatch delta fragments to update old databases or just run a game in an emulator which doesn't parse the database at all.

<br />
<br />replace .db with .xml, cd/dvd images with .chd format (used by MAME/MESS for CDs and DVDs) and you will get exactly what MAME/MESS is doing since almost one year. add cmpro as the single tool necessary to handle software for all the databases.
<br />
<br />I'm not saying that everyone should use the MESS xml format (<strong>there is always space for alternative approaches</strong>, as long as the info remain open so that all projects can gain from progresses done by other projects), but I really find weird seeing devs which consider as "brand new" something which has been around since last spring for most consoles, whose correspondent files are pretty widely available, and that is nothing else than the MAME approach translated into an external database (and the external database is available for MAME too since more than 5 years, if you parse the -listxml output)

<br />
<br />The ZapFC checksum is a hash of two hashes, so you still have the same problem.
<br />
<br />Anyway (and I'm reluctant to even post in this thread, considering FitzRoy's reaction to any criticism), I just don't get the point.  My emulator requires checksum-based mapping for few games.  If I'm going to implement a (complete) database, I'd much rather prefer a simpler format that accomplishes the same thing, e.g. prghash,chrhash,board (where board could be iNES mapper number+new mappings to accommodate variations).  If there's a match, indicate that it's a verified dump, if not, fall back on the iNES header.
<br />
<br />One more thing re: iNES being a custom container.  Who cares?  The data itself already requires a custom tool (the emulator) to interpret it, so what's the benefit of distributing the files in an 'standard' container?

<br />
<br />as I said, there is always space for new approaches, and better info can only improve the overall quality of all the databases (as long as info are kept public)
<br />
<br />one of the reasons we used xml in MESS was because MAME already had all the necessary code to handle it (plus the config and cheats are in xml format too, so we reduce to minimum the parsing code this way), but I can understand if other emus decide to use a different approach because e.g. expat is too large or because you consider the syntax 'bloated'
<br />
<br />anyway, whatever database approach is going to be used I'd love to see proper dumps finally used by emulators <strong>in addition</strong> to iNES2.0 and UNIF. 
<br />for this reason, feel free to exploit the info from nes.xml for all the carts which are still unconfirmed by bootgod: I have tested all of them one by one so that the basics are correct (even if you might want to keep in mind that I have always used generic NES-TLROM and NES-SLROM without MMC types for the carts not in bootgod's db). a simple python or perl script should help converting all info, except the checksum...

<br />
<br />There's a good bit of hate for XML. I wasn't fond of it until I gave it a chance. It's really great being able to extend the spec a bit without breaking the old format.
<br />
<br />As for expat, it's pretty easy to write a 99% conformant parser in ~3-8KB of code if that is your concern. But you should probably stick with expat for speed and correctness anyway.
<br />
<br />But yeah, let people use whatever they want. Conversion isn't that difficult.

<br />Ignoring incorrect header info (irrelevant with a verified checksum), I don't see how iNES prevents either of these from happening.  Granted, a .zip file is easier to modify than an iNES container.  And if the iNES header has an incorrect number of prg/chr banks, all bets are off.
<br />
<br />I get it -- iNES is not ideal.  For the vast majority of situations, though, it works fine, and the edge cases are easy to handle.
<br />
<br />On a side note, why haven't the edge cases been assigned to a new iNES mapper number already?  Isn't that a good indicator that the problem has already been adequately addressed?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />And now <a href="http://kode54.foobar2000.org/stuff.php" class="postlink">QuickNES</a> is the first NES emulator to support the ZapFC database. Currently, it supports the database raw or packed into any of the supported archive formats. (zip, gzip, rar, or 7-zip LZMA/LZMA2/PPMd) It searches the configuration folder first, then the program folder, for a file named ZapFC*.fbsv*, favoring the one with the newest modification timestamp. It also correctly supports the board file extension, although it currently allows the first three fields to be populated.
<br />
<br />The ROM packages are accepted as *.fc.&lt;archive extension&gt;.
<br />
<br />It also supports (rom name).ips.* archived split patches for ZapFC ROM packages, also in any of the supported archive formats.
<br />
<br />Oh, and because I'm lazy, and because QuickNES doesn't currently support board differentiation anyway, I use the board type as the mapper number.
<br />
<br />I also eliminated my original mapper/mirroring override table, since most of the games it contained were probably licensed games covered by this database. The rest can be fixed with proper ZapFC board files, or if the world really needs them, properly edited iNES headers. (I'm looking at you, Buzz and Waldog, being distributed with a mapper number 255 in the header, but having a CRC32 override to mapper 156 built into various emulators well before the ROM image was even released to the general public.)
<br />
<br />I also still need to work out some issues, though, such as &gt;8KB SRAM and handling different banks of SRAM being battery backed or not. At this point, QuickNES only supports 8KB of SRAM, and I'm not exactly sure which mappers support more than that, how they handle swapping it, and whether it even matters as I may not even support any of the relevant mappers.
<br />
<br />And while I'm at it, I will mention that I also attempt to match iNES ROM dumps against the database for mapper and mirroring overrides. I already found one dump that was GoodNES verified that failed this match. Maybe my original dump was old or bad, and has since been replaced?

<br />Agreed.  So if the primary goal is verifiability/preservation, then how about a zip container containing (only) prg and chr, with a simple database mapping mechanism.  No match, no go.  Homebrew, etc. stick with iNES (or iNES2 or UNIF).
