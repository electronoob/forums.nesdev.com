Maybe just flip the controls 45 degrees right like most Rare games? Or pressing both top buttons triggers the 'Up' button? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br /><br />Of course, you can just <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/1211/" class="postlink">hack</a> a game to change its controls, but that's no fun. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

The person imposing a horizontal orientation on the controller you're holding is you.<br /><br />I remember Q-Bert had a nice arcade stick that operated in a diagonal cross rather than the usual horizontal cross. There are some old Joust cabinets where the joystick only goes left or right, since up and down are unused. When your controls are built into the game, you can do some pretty elegant things with them.

I went ahead and snapped these shots just now:<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9ZES07d.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dJSaTsB.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />On that note, a Japanese-style Sanwa or Seimitsu arcade joystick has a square gate, which is already primed for diagonals (and isometric) use.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I figured Joust was just a 2-way direction stick, which would be sensible (i.e. cheaper) if you make the sticks yourself, which I presume Williams might have since they were a pinball machine manufacturer.<br /><br />If you're a hobbyist trying to build your own authentic-feeling Joust cabinet, I dunno how easy it would be to find a real 2-way stick these days. If you're scavenging used parts, I'd assume 4/8-way sticks are more common, and mechanically limiting one into a 2-way might be easiest? (I'm just speculating.)<br /><br />On a related note, does anyone remember those bizarre Defender controls? A 2-way up-down stick and then a whooooole lot of other buttons.

Once you are used to playing Joust though, it feels very wrong playing on anything with microswitches.
