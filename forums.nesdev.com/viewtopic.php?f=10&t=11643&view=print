I am using the following iNES header:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; .inesmap 4&nbsp; &nbsp;; mapper 4 = MMC3<br />&nbsp; .inesprg 8<br />&nbsp; .ineschr 8<br />&nbsp; .inesmir 3&nbsp; &nbsp;; background mirroring</div><br />I set up my MMC3 settings with the following:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDA #%01000010<br />STA $8000</div><br />this write says that I will be using two 2 KB banks at PPU $0000-$0FFF, and four 1 KB banks at PPU $1000-$1FFF which is what I want. Also, this write sets up my next write so that I am about to bank switch the 1 KB bank at PPU $1000-$13FF with whatever bank number I select to write to $8001.<br /><br />I have a single 32K .chr file I'm including for all my graphics. Also, since I have selected .inesprg 8, then I understand that banks 0 through 15 are for the CPU. I have included the file by this method:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; .bank 16<br />&nbsp; .org $0000<br />&nbsp; .incbin &quot;tiles.chr&quot;</div><br />Question: Under the settings I have, what bank numbers represent which sections of my tiles.chr? For example, how could I take the information at $4000-$43FF of my tiles.chr and bank switch that into the PPU at say, PPU $1000-$13FF?

I can't tell for sure, since I don't use this assembler, so hopefully someone else will confirm this.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">raydempsey wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Question: Under the settings I have, what bank numbers represent which sections of my tiles.chr? For example, how could I take the information at $4000-$43FF of my tiles.chr and bank switch that into the PPU at say, PPU $1000-$13FF?</div><br />You select the target location for the tiles by writing to $8000. If your goal is to map the tiles to $1000-$13FF, that would mean that you have the second pattern table broken up in 4 1KB chunks, and you should set the lower 3 bits of the $8000 write to 010 (2), to tell the mapper you'll be mapping tiles into the first 1Kb slot. Then simply write the bank index to $8001. Since you want the bank located $4000 bytes into the CHR file, and each bank is 1KB ($400 bytes) large, the bank number is $4000 / $400 = $10, or 16 in decimal. When bankswitching 2KB CHR banks, the lower bit of the bank index is ignored. This means that to select the third 2KB bank, you'll not be writing 3 to $8001, you'll write 6, because the banks are twice as large as the 1KB ones.<br /><br />All of this is written in the wiki page, be sure to check it out if you haven't already: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC3">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC3</a><!-- m -->

It's kind of quirky because NESASM allows overwriting data in existing banks. I guess that feature also makes it impossible to report bank overflows.

It's kind of quirky because NESASM allows overwriting data in existing banks. I guess that feature also makes it impossible to report bank overflows.</div><br />I just double checked that. NESASM reports happen for the code and for byte\word declarations like .db  or .dw. There is no reports for .incbin where included binary file is bigger than space left in the current bank.<br />The overwriting data in existing banks is not completly correct. The included binary file will be included as a whole if there is no next bank declaration.<br />For example, our &quot;example.bin&quot; is 16kb in size.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.bank 0<br />&nbsp;.org $8000<br />&nbsp;.incbin &quot;example.bin&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;.bank 2<br />&nbsp;.org $C000<br />;anything in here<br /><br />&nbsp;.bank 3<br />&nbsp;.org $E000<br />;anything in here<br /></div><br />In example above, the example.bin will be included, first half will be in bank 0, the other one in bank 1.<br /><br />But if you declare bank 1 existance...<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.bank 0<br />&nbsp;.org $8000<br />&nbsp;.incbin &quot;example.bin&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;.bank 1<br />&nbsp;.org $A000<br />;anything in here<br /><br />&nbsp;.bank 2<br />&nbsp;.org $C000<br />;anything in here<br /><br />&nbsp;.bank 3<br />&nbsp;.org $E000<br />;anything in here<br /></div><br />Then only first 8kb will be included , the other half of the &quot;example.bin&quot; will be cut and removed. There will be no report of the overflow as well :\
