<br />
<br />Good fucking lord MySQL has way too many places to change character set encoding / translation.
<br />
<br />I think there's still some leftover crap dealing with UTF-8 migration.  The database and tables were converted to UTF-8 long ago like I mentioned, but I believe the character set encoding used between the MySQL client (i.e. the webserver) and the MySQL server (on another box) is still latin1.
<br />
<br />According to one of the user comments on this MySQL documentation page, the client/server encoding can screw up UTF-8 as well:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/charset-connection.html" class="postlink">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/charset-connection.html</a>
<br />
<br />While using the nesdev_phpbb database, SHOW VARIABLES returns the following (I'm using the standard mysql client on the webserver, which I don't have set to use utf8):
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">| character_set_client&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | latin1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />| character_set_connection&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | latin1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />| character_set_database&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | utf8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />| character_set_results&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| latin1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />| character_set_server&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | latin1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />| character_set_system&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | utf8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|</div><br /><br />I think part-of the solution is to add these queries to the MySQL connection code in phpbb.  I think the CHARACTER_SET one is already being used (I think I added this myself), but the NAMES one I don't think I'm using:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">SET NAMES utf8;<br />SET CHARACTER_SET utf8;</div>

<br />Looks like db/mysql4.php got overwritten to deal with some changes back in November (Memblers mentioned this).  mysql4.php was one of the scripts I had to change to explicitly request a different character set when initiating a mysql connection.
<br />
<br />I made a backup of the original, renaming it to mysql4.php__not_utf8_do_not_use:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">-rw-r--r--&nbsp; 1 memblers&nbsp; users&nbsp; 6066 Nov 16 18:56 mysql.php<br />-rw-r--r--&nbsp; 1 memblers&nbsp; users&nbsp; 6486 Nov 16 18:56 mysql4.php<br />-rw-------&nbsp; 1 memblers&nbsp; users&nbsp; 6482 Jul 17&nbsp; 2004 mysql4.php__not_utf8_do_not_use<br /></div><br /><br />However, a diff between the original non-utf8 and the currently used one (mysql4.php) shows absolutely no character set encoding requests or anything (meaning my changes got wiped out):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">--- mysql4.php&nbsp; Wed Nov 16 18:56:14 2005<br />+++ mysql4.php__not_utf8_do_not_use&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sat Jul 17 08:58:20 2004<br />@@ -6,7 +6,7 @@<br />&nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp;copyright&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : &#40;C&#41; 2001 The phpBB Group<br />&nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp;email&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : supportphpbb.com<br />&nbsp; *<br />- *&nbsp; &nbsp;$Id: mysql4.php,v 1.5.2.1 2005/09/18 16:17:20 acydburn Exp $<br />+ *&nbsp; &nbsp;$Id: mysql4.php,v 1.5 2002/04/02 21:13:47 the_systech Exp $<br />&nbsp; *<br />&nbsp; ***************************************************************************/<br /><br />@@ -271,7 +271,7 @@<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if&#40; $this-&gt;rowset&#91;$query_id&#93; &#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#123;<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$result = $this-&gt;rowset&#91;$query_id&#93;&#91;0&#93;&#91;$field&#93;;<br />+&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$result = $this-&gt;rowset&#91;$query_id&#93;&#91;$field&#93;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#125;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; else if&#40; $this-&gt;row&#91;$query_id&#93; &#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#123;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />So, my guess is that this is what's causing the problem.
<br />
<br />I'll edit mysql4.php momentarily to put the UTF-8 stuff back in.  Argh.  :-)

Sounds great, I know, but the problem is that if I remove that clause the client&lt;-&gt;server model communicates everything in latin1 (even though the actual encoding type of the content is utf8).  I believe there's translation that goes on (i.e. utf8 characters being coallated into latin1 for the MySQL connection then being coallated back into utf8 when the actual data is stored into the database).<br /><br />SET NAMES 'utf8' basically does this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">mysql&gt; SET character_set_client = utf8;<br />mysql&gt; SET character_set_results = utf8;<br />mysql&gt; SET character_set_connection = utf8;</div>
<br />
<br />I'll leave this one up to Quietust to decide.

<br />Personally, I think it's best to just leave the database with <em>no encoding</em> at all - just let it store the data as if it were binary. Let the software running on the site (phpBB, the wiki, etc.) and the users (namely, their browsers) decide how to interpret it.

Maybe ALTER can do it, but I'm still not sure how to accomplish that.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Personally, I think it's best to just leave the database with <em>no encoding</em> at all - just let it store the data as if it were binary.

<br />
<br />It doesn't seem to work that way.  There's a lot of pieces to the puzzle:
<br />
<br />* Database character encoding
<br />* Table character encoding
<br />* Column character encoding (not used in this case though)
<br />* Client-server character encoding
<br />* Coallation for all of the above (i.e. utf8 converted to latin1, etc.)
<br />* Browser character encoding
<br />* The character encoding type specified in the HTTP header
<br />
<br />What a mess.
<br />
<br />At this point, anything that relies on MySQL requires that you set the character encoding.  All of this was introduced in 4.0, and now that 5.0 is the official stable release, I expect to see it even more prominently used.
<br />
<br />My personal view is that people (i.e. forum software authors) need to stop mucking around with "support for multiple languages" (by having absurd "packages" for different languages/character sets, etc.).  They need to just use utf8 and solve the problem in one swoop.

<br />I can see the encoding difference between SET NAMES vs. without SET NAMES, and without SET NAMES the characters look to be the same as they were when we lacked SET CHARACTER_SET.

<br />True.  I didn't think about that.
<br />
<br />Though, admittedly, maintaining a multi-language interface is something everyone's already done (by this I mean the code/framework + all the necessary files are there).  The problem is that all of the data is written in a non-Unicode character set, so it wouldn't end up displaying right under utf8 anyways.
<br />
<br />Apache has modules for handling stuff like this: mod_negotiation (and the Multiviews directive).  Based on browser preferences and some HTTP headers, you can determine what language someone prefers.  Compare this to, say, a forum which has a dropdown for what "language" they want the interface in.
<br />
<br />Not everyone uses Apache, but this would provide what people want for the most part.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The biggest oxy-moron in the phpBB Language Pack system is that while each language specifies a <strong>different</strong> character set, the forum allows <strong>multiple</strong> language packs to be installed at once, which results in horrible conflicts when messages get posted.
<br />
<br />The obvious solutions would be to either restrict the forum to only allow one language pack at once (which is rather stupid) OR force them all to use the same character set (i.e. Unicode, preferably UTF-8). The phpBB Team is aware of this problem, and it looks like they <em>might</em> fix it in the next major release, but I'm not holding my breath.

<br />Done.

<br />I'll corollate with you on IRC (Freenode) in regards to the post editing stuff and the like.
