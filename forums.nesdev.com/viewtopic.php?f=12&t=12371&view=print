		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Currently, the 12F629 PIC is used as a CIC replacement.  <br />On the PIC IC, pins 2,5,6,7 are used as I/O's.<br />Is there a way that the pins can be reconfigured so that data from pin2 of the PIC is changed to pin 4?<br />I ask this because if that pin change is able to take place, I can program/reprogram it in circuit through the cart edge connector.  I shouldn't even have to open the case (in theory anyways) to program it.<br />The programming pins are  4,6 and 7.  4 is unused currently in CIC usage.<br /><br />So if this is possible, could I trouble someone to help me with this?<br /><br />Thanks

It's remotely plausible (if /MCLR is disabled) that you might be able to permanently connect pins 2 and 4 together, though. Of course ... then you can't use high-voltage programming without damaging the PIC by exposing pin 2 to high voltage :/<br /><br />You could disable /MCLR and add a 12V-tolerant inverter or buffer from pin 4 to pin 2. That should get you both worlds...

I'd prefer not to damage the device in programming (unless a diode could be used to protect pin 2 maybe?).<br /><br />Edit:  how would I disable the MCLR?<br /><br />Edit2:  I'm just needing a pathway to the PIC's pin 4.  Could I use the IRQ pathway on the cart edge?  all standard carts don't have that pin connected to anything.  Of course, if I did make the IRQ pin connect to the PIC pin4, would that mess-up the console or just ignored by both console and PIC?

The '629 is rated to a maximum of 20mA of clamp current, so any resistor strictly greater than (12V-5V)÷(20mA)=350Ω should keep it from dying. (I'd go up by an order of magnitude for safety's sake). The only question is whether the ≈4MHz clock source from the SNES can pass through that resistor.<br /><br /><br />All this said, it looks like it might be possible to port the supercic to the 10f322, which is a 6-pin part, and all four non-power pins from the PIC would necessarily then be brought to the cartridge edge.

This is for future designs as my current stuff is already set in stone (so to speak).   Would porting it just require renaming the GIO pin names to match the new PIC's pins?
