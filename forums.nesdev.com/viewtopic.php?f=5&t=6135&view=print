<br />Yeah, I was gonna ask you guys about that. The first time I heard an american saying it I was surprised, but then I realized everyone pronounced it "N", "E", "S". But in this video I heard someone pronouncing it like "NES" for the first time.
<br />
<br />Saying it letter by letter is much more common than saying "NES" in the US, right?
<br />
<br />Here in Brazil nobody calls it "N", "E", "S", few people call it "NES", but the majority calls it "Nintendinho", the diminutive of "Nintendo". I guess it's because the official NES was only released after the SNES (usually called "Super Nintendo") here, so people tried to make it clear that the NES was the little brother. Also, many people don't know what an NES is, they know the various clones we had, like the Phantom System, without even realizing they were NES clones.

<br />When I heard american people saying "Nintendo" I always wondered if they really meant the NES or just the "console manufactured by Nintendo", because in movies and such it was also common to hear people saying they'd play "SEGA", even though SEGA doesn't have a console named "SEGA", so they were actually talking about the Genesis or the Saturn.

Here people most often call it (mitakingly) "Super Nintendo" as many people don't make any distinction between both systems anymore. It used to be refered (confusingly) to plain "Nintendo", so to avoid confusion with the company now people refer it to "the old 8-bit Nintendo" or something like that.
<br />
<br />With the raise of Internet communality calling it "NES" or calls it plain "NES" (pronounced ness).

<br />This reminds me a bit of this Sonic the Hedgehog retrospective, which I find very interesting:

<br />
<br />Although it's game-specific, it contains quite a bit of video game history, like the NES video. So even if you are not a Sonic fan it might still be interesting.

<br />Often depends on the area someone's from.  Most I've heard (here out west) pronounce NES and SNES as a single word ("ness" and "super ness").  Folks I know from the midwest tend to emphasise each letter ("enn eee ess" and "super enn eee ess"), and east coast seems to be either-or.  Those from the south tend to pronounce it "gyuh-hyuk, youz gotz a purdy mouf".
<br />
<br />The first time I heard someone pronounce it "enn eee ess" it came as somewhat of a shock but you get over it pretty quick.  Less talk, more gaming.  ;D

<br />I just want you to know that whenever you post stuff like this, it's like my brain gets smashed into a brick wall at 900km/h.  Harold and the PURPLE CRAYON.  Wh... b... a... *cries himself to sleep*
<br />
<br />Edit: I meant that in a nice way... mostly.  :)  It's just so crazy/random that I can't stop laughing while my brain tries to process it and fails.  Every time.
