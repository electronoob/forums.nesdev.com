Ranking Mega Man games is like asking for my favorite craft beer.  It's a hard question because they're all different flavors of good!  Trying to pick a favorite probably depends on the given day and my particular mood at the moment you ask me.<br /><br />I'm surprised by all the love that Mega man 2 has gotten over the last several years as one of the greatest NES games ever.  I loved it as a kid because it was the easiest.  Honestly I don't think it's aged as well as MM3 or MM6.  The &quot;rock paper scissors&quot; mechanic is flawed because several Robot Masters can easily be beaten with the standard gun, and the rest are cake once you get Metal Blade.<br /><br />MM3 seems to be the best overall, and certainly the longest one to beat.  The Rock Paper Scissors mechanic isa lot better, creating a pretty logical sequence in which you beat the bosses (every Robot Master has one weapon they're really vulnerable to.)  The Rush adapters and slide move added a lot to the Mega Man series.  It's important to keep in mind that even though MM1 &amp; 3 are held up as the &quot;hardest&quot; Mega Man games, the MM games were considerably easier than the sadistic difficulty level in many popular NES games of the era.  MM3 feels like a cakewalk compared to Battletoads!<br /><br />As far as the other NES games go, MM1 seems like a rough draft of the original Mega Man vision.  Maybe it's because elements like the corridors filled with shooting enemies before a boss battle were dropped by MM2, and all the other games largely stuck to the MM2 formula.  MM4 seemed like more of the same after MM3, with the charge shot and Eddie not adding that much to the MM formula.  Same goes for MM5 and the addition of Beat.<br /><br />After the formulaic nature of MM4 &amp; 5, MM6 was a breath of fresh air for the series.  The new Rush adapters made for some new gameplay mechanics, the graphics were top-notch, the music was 8-bit perfection, and alternate branches in certain levels certainly added to the replay value.<br /><br />So if you put a gun to my head and asked for my favorite Mega Man games, I'd say 3,2,6,1,4,5.  Also worth a mention is Mega Man 8.  Seeing Mega Man rendered in beautiful cartoony animation with anime cut-scenes was a dream come true (despite the annoying voice acting.)  Memory cards finally eliminated the tedium of writing passwords down.  And the game was pretty darn fun to play, even if the snowboard sequences were stolen from Donkey Kong Country.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6573">impossiblescissors</a> — Sun Jun 22, 2014 5:21 pm</p><hr />

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Mega Man for NES</strong></span><br /><br />1. The original Mega Man is the second best game, but I rank it 1st because it was the beginning of ALL. I love some dramatic tunes there. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> No energy tanks, spikes are always insta-kill. Bosses are hard, unless you do a trick with the P weapon and a good timing. The Iceman' stage is the hardest one.<br /><br />2. Mega Man IV is my best. It brings the original feeling in a few moments (like the boss chosen music) and vibrato in various tunes. An improved version if compared with all the others. No idea why people complains about the Mega Buster here, by saying &quot;the best buster is in MMV&quot;. Oh well... <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> The music uses some kind of &quot;echoes&quot;, making even nicer than ever. It's also hard, a patterned sequence must be followed in order to kill Ringman, for example. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />3. Mega Man VI is my third game. I got my cartridge after my Super NES. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> They've resized the M.Buster and... his shot sound was overlapped by the single shot sound, aww! Anyway, nice tunes and balanced difficulty, I'd say Flameman' stage is one of the hardest in the game. Nice tunes and a few MM2 elements too. The boss chosen screen was overloaded with boss information, kinda crap. Difficulty level is medium.<br /><br />4. Mega Man II is the next one. First time I played it (in 1990), I was &quot;shocked&quot; because it hadn't a score! At anyway, it was a classic. A very good game, starring the password system and E tanks (max. of 4), nice tunes and colors. Bosses are medium-to-hard, I'd say Quickman and Crashman are the hardest ones. Dramatic ending and tune! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />5. Mega Man III is also the &quot;incomplete game&quot;. In his release, it was very cool to listen the new sound effects and the new music style, less dramatic. Rush Jet was unfinished, so you can fly around freely. Bosses are picky, specially Needleman. It has classic tunes, but in another style. It's the first longest MM game - after beating the 8 bosses, you revisit 4 revamped stages and bosses from MM2! Ay anyway, average only.<br /><br />6. Mega Man V is the last one on my list. A poor weapon system, a few MM3 elements... nice graphics, but not so fun like the others. Music is just ok. People say this version has the best M.Buster, bigger and cooler. The castle bosses are pretty poor. New elements include smaller boss doors, Beat bird (you need to collect medals M,E,G,A,M,A,N,V in the game to unlock it), new M.Buster, Charge Kick is activated by sliding.<br /><br />7. Mega Man VII (Super NES) is, in short words, a toy-like game. Game elements were oversized - Mega Man is too big, everything was increased. Springman' stage is like a toy paradise. Weird. Good because &quot;it's a MM game&quot; - just don't take it true for MMX7, ok? <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">MY MM LIFE</span></strong><br /><br />- I'm sure that I played Rockman 1 around 1989, thanks to a neighbor boy that has the cart and we trade them for a few days. Next was Ducktales, then Rambo. Thanks to him, I could play classic NES games. I got Rockman 2 a few months later in a supermarket. All the games weren't originals, but made by NTDEC for a NES close console named &quot;Top Game&quot;, most of them were japanese copies. Yup, a couple of other NES clone consoles were popping up with the time! As I said, when I played Rockman 2 for the first time, I wonder about the missing score system. I did a big &quot;MEH&quot;, but later... a lot of fun! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> The other MM games were got thanks to school boys. We bought magazines (no internet that time), we rent pirated copies (heh), I played with friends in their houses... and found Super Pitfall, another &quot;bad, but classic&quot; game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=39">Zepper</a> — Sat Jun 21, 2014 2:45 pm</p><hr />

Mega Man 1 Is definitely one of the good Mega Man games of the series. But also one of the hardest. It's not hard to beat the normal stages unless you the order BombMan, Gutsman, Cutman, Elecman, Iceman, Fireman. After that you head for Wily's Castle. Now it's hard. <br /><br />Mega Man 3 is easy you just continue giving yourself Energy Pods in the password screen.<br /><br />Mega Man 2 is one of the best ones out there. Not too hard. Not to easy. But very fun.<br /><br />I haven't got Mega Man 4,5,6 Yet. I'm not good with money.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />But I would say the hardest is MM1<br />The most popular is MM2<br />The best? Everyone has an opinion. I say MM2.<br />But that's my opinion.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6571">TetrisMaster1989</a> — Fri Jun 20, 2014 5:46 pm</p><hr />

I always liked mega man 1 better than 2. Mega man 2 has the best music and maybe the best graphics of the series, but there was always something a bit better about the first one for me. I haven't really played past 3 and didn't ever play it as much as the first two. The series kind of loses me after that, with the increasing ridiculous bosses especially.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4680">Movax12</a> — Fri Jun 20, 2014 4:48 pm</p><hr />

So, it looks like 2 is generally regarded as the easiest and the most popular one.<br /><br />Why is the yellow devil in MM1 considered so hard? I haven't played against him myself yet, but as far as I see in the videos on YouTube, isn't this just about evading his body parts? I cannot imagine that <em>this</em> is the hardest thing of all MM1, 2 and 3.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6156">DRW</a> — Fri Jun 20, 2014 12:08 pm</p><hr />

Am I the only one who thinks 4 is way harder than 1-2-3 together ?<br /><br />In most stages, the enemies needs to take a LOT of damage before they die, are you are supposed to use your mega buster, but doing so is slow and annoying. In 1-2-3 the enemies dies after one or two shots. There is those extremely annoying flying enemies everywhere and there is nothing comarable in 1-2-3.<br /><br />Most bosses of 4 can't be beaten without their weakness as their attacks are fast as lightning and impossible to avoid, so your only hope is to kamikaze and kill them before they kill you using their weakness. Except for some exceptions (such as Needle Man, Shadow Man or Elec Man), most bosses of 1-2-3 can be beaten with the Mega Buster if you're prepared enough.<br /><br />And the wily stages of 4 are even more hard than the normal stages, especially the bosses which are multi part and it's hard to find their weak point. The last battle is simply ridiculous, you only see Wily for 1 frame and he's invisible 99% of the time, and you can only hit him with one of the weapons. Without save states that one battle alone is plain I-M-P-O-S-S-I-B-L-E.<br /><br />I think 4 is definitely the hardest one, far harder than 7 which is already extremely hard in the Wily stages (but normally hard for the normal stages).<br />And it's true the yellow devil in 1 is insanely hard, but the rest of the game is relatively easy (except that part in Ice Man's stage where there is no ground), and you can overcome it easily with the pause trick.<br /><br />2 and 3 are definitely very easy, as you can have plenty of E-Tanks so if you're in trouble you can always refill health.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Jun 19, 2014 12:56 am</p><hr />

Hardest<br />I think all three first games are almost equally hard. 1 is hard at times but short, 2 is really only hard in some stages of the Wily Castle, and 3 would be the hardest of them (especially since you need to fight two Doc robots per stage later on) if it wouldn't be for the super easy Wily Castle stages. I haven't played enough of the other games to say for sure but they seem to be about medium hard. 7 is very hard at the end but I guess only NES games count.<br /><br />Most popular<br />Yeah 2 is definitely the most popular one. It was the first game for many people.<br /><br />Best<br />My personal favourite is 3. Cubeboy pretty much nails it. I like the slide move, Rush adapters, even though exploiting the Rush Jet almost feels like cheating, and Doc robots that uses old robots' programming. The music is great, but so is the music for 1 and 2. I would rank them 3, 1, 2, 6, 4/5. I'm not sure which is better of 4 and 5.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6013">Pokun</a> — Thu Jun 19, 2014 12:46 am</p><hr />

1. Which one is the hardest? Mega Man 1. Two words... Yellow Devil. The Yellow Devil is hard enough, add in those moving shooting platforms above instant spike death... that's a hair pulling nightmare.<br />2. Which one was the most popular? Mega Man 2 for sure. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that once you get the metal blade, the game becomes a lot easier. <br />3. Which one is the best? Mega Man 3 personally. Something about 3 feels right to me. It's a good balance of new ideas, and old themes tied into one. The sound track for 3 is also very good. And I LOVE that the Mega Man 2 bosses make a come back.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6248">cubeboy</a> — Wed Jun 18, 2014 9:29 pm</p><hr />

I agree with his points 3 and 4 definitely, and it's true music in MM1 is good but it's even better in MM2. The score however just gets in the way and has no purpose I don't see why you would want them by any extent.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Jun 12, 2014 11:31 pm</p><hr />

I prefer the scores when they don't do anything.<br /><br />And I consider the pause trick is probably a bug, if it does that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4734">zzo38</a> — Thu Jun 12, 2014 6:30 pm</p><hr />
