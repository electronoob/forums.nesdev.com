So I guess there might be something wrong with palette writes, too (although I would have to test the palette writes on the visual 2C02 to make sure this isn't a bug specific to my code)

Sorry for the wording of this paragraph.  :)<br /><br />As for the rest of the PPU RAM values: I'm fairly certain PPU palette mirroring plays a role here (with regards to what values you end up seeing in PPU RAM).  Can't really help with the &quot;internal behaviour&quot; aspect.

The 2A03 had no significant change (all node definitions are unchanged as far as I could tell). The 2C02 had some changes to node definitions, apparently related to sprite position, but that wouldn't explain the DMA bug (since it's a 2A03 issue). Maybe the bug has always been there?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />One somewhat important thing to consider is that the Visual 2A03 and Visual 2C02 use <strong>slightly different versions</strong> of ChipSim - I believe Visual 2A03 uses the same version as Visual 6502, but Visual 2C02 uses different logic to resolve groups of &quot;floating&quot; nodes (whereby it considers the <em>area</em> of each node to determine whether the group goes high or low) to fix $2007 writes and Sprite DRAM refreshes.<br /><br />Of course, there are also several bugs in the Javascript versions of Visual 2A03/2C02 that I've simply never gotten around to fixing...

I'll keep running some in the background and try to get through most of the CPU-related tests done eventually (some take a long time to run so it may take a while).  At least that way we'll have an idea of what works and what doesn't. Not sure if that would help in actually finding and fixing bugs, though - and unfortunately, I have very little hope of being able to fix these myself.

It really does seem like the most likely culprit in this case.<br /><br />(How difficult would it be to disable the decimal mode in Visual 6502 in the same way that they disabled it in 2A03?

	</div><br />Progress?  Sort of...<br /><br />I've forced all 5 transistors mentioned above to be &quot;on&quot; at all times (this is what the link said the 2A03's modifications did) and this is what I'm getting now - the official opcodes pass, but now these unofficial ones apparently don't (I've only tried this test though, since it completes in about an hour, vs 4+ for some of the others).<br /><br />I had hacked up blargg's test before trying this to make sure the instructions were always performed with the decimal flag off, and that version of the test actually gave me the same result (I think - unfortunately did not save the result screen from that) - so I guess decimal mode is actually correctly disabled by this, but then why do these break when decimal mode is off is another story.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since the wiki says it takes 2-3 and 3-4 cpu cycles for the sequencer counter to reset, i tried to see if i could find out with visual nes. Also if half and quarter frames are delayed or not.<br />I'm not very good at using visual nes or especially operating the apu, but here goes...<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">test:<br />lda 0x0F<br />sta 0x4000 //set volume / envelope to 15 to see when it decreases<br />lda 0x80<br />sta 0x4017 //restart things<br />jmp test<br /><br /><br />Cpu cycles, starting from the write cycle in STA 0x4017:<br /><br />0: Write to 0x4017<br />1: Read<br />2: Read* (happens if write was or wasn't on an apu cycle, probably if it wasn't)<br />3: Read - cpu_frm_half and cpu_frm_quarter goes low, cpu_sq0_envt3-0 decrements<br />4: Read - cpu_'frm_/tXX' resets</div><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">If I shouldn't post random visual nes testing in this topic, tell me haha...</span><br /><br /><br />So I guess that's 2-3 cpu cycles of delay until half and quarter frames resets? The sequencer counter, if I even logged the correct thing, resets one cycle later instead of doing some kind of increment.<br />I'm incrementing the sequencer counter every cpu cycle, resetting the counter instead of / and incrementing at the same time as half &amp; quarter frames should work in that case, I think. I say &quot;instead of / and&quot; because resetting *and* incrementing makes my emulator pass blargg's apu jitter test, but that doesn't really mean much.<br /><br />I also tried &quot;asl 0x4017&quot; just because, it seems to write back 0xFF which wasn't what I was expecting (0x80?) but should work anyway. It doesn't toggle cpu_frm_half and cpu_frm_quarter. It seems to reset the counter based on the first write, which would make sense.<br /><br />---<br /><br />The download link has a typo, btw! &quot;VisualNEs.zip&quot;
