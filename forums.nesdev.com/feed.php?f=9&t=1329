Thanks for the help. I'm planning on giving it a try this weekend, but I have one more question for now: the /WR pin is pin number 56 on the cart, right? I don't heve my cart here right now, but I know it lacks some pins by the middle, where pin 56 would be. So there is a possibility that this procedure can't be done to the Spy vs Spy cart?<br /><br />I got another NROM game yesterday, though, it's Gyromite. This board is in much better shape than the Spy vs Spy one, and has all the pins, so I figured this would be my main NROM devcart, and Spy vs Spy was going to be used for experimental stuff (such as changing CHR-ROM for CHR-RAM). But if it lacks pin 56 I guess it is impossible then?<br /><br />Thanks again for the help so far.<br /><br />EDIT: OK, looking at the pinouts I think pin 56 (CHR /WR) of the cart has to be connected to pin 27 (/WE) on the 6264. Is that it? What else needs to be done? I think pin 26 on tthe 6264 needs some handling, but I'm really not sure of anything.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Apr 07, 2006 10:57 am</p><hr />

"OE" = output enable<br />"CE" = chip enable<br /><br />Virgule (/OE) or overline (O&#773;E&#773;): active low, meaning that the signal is asserted when at a logic value 0 (tied to GND).<br /><br />As for "PRG", that's short for program. I guess it has something to do with the fact that some EPROMs and EEPROMs take a higher voltage to write than to read.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Apr 06, 2006 6:44 pm</p><hr />

Could someone please give me a crash course on the meaning of the pins? I can guess "A" stands for "address" and "D" stands for "data", but that's about it. Oh, and "GND" is "ground", right? I mean... I have no idea what are the "OE", "CE", "WE" things, and have no idea why a CHR chip has pins named "PRG".

Hook the PPU /Write signal up to the VRAM's /WR pin.  You'll have to totally desolder it from the PRG stuff of course.  I've got an idea to make a WRAM-VRAM shared memory, but that's a whole other thing. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />If you get a new RAM chip for any reason, it's usually cheaper/easier to find a 62256 (32kB).<br /><br />Also, 6264 chips have both a positive and negative chip enable.  That's fine as long as the positive CE is held at 5V.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Apr 06, 2006 1:39 am</p><hr />

Is it by any chance possible to use a WRAM chip from a cart in the place of a CHR-ROM chip in an NROM board?
