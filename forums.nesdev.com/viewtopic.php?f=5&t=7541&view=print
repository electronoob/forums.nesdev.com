<br />
<br />So today I'm asking everyone on here and everywhere else I browse to change their status to
<br />
<br />"Gary Marven will win the lotto on March 5 2011, pass it on."
<br />
<br />Who knows crazier things have happened.

<br />I thank all in advance that do this.

<br />I had to do a double take to make sure that said "Jeroen" and not "Jargon". I seem to remember having encountered another user who continued to post completely unrelated things in General Stuff while ignoring warnings that "NESdev is not your blog." There's already a sticky warning at the top along the lines "NESdev is not Gen[M]ay". On the other hand, in a lot of cases, explanation as to how a particular topic relates to NES development might take more room than the topic itself. (See perhaps the worst case example of <a href="http://pics.pineight.com/dwi/BF/backstory.txt" class="postlink">how "Balloon Fever", my remix of a song from Balloon Fight, came to be</a>.)

<br />
<br />If your dream was really a prediction of the future, then it shouldn't matter if we do this or not; you ask everyone to change their status, which causes <em>enough</em> people to change their status, which means you win.

<br />
<br />Other than that video game ideas often come from dreams, no. But this could easily be a plot point in an RPG that takes place in a setting whose magic runs on the principle of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" class="postlink">clap your hands if you believe</a>. Discworld is one of those settings.
