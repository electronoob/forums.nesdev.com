<br />Recently I've tested some games on a various emulators and noticed that each emulator use it's own NES palette. When I play on my own Famiclone I'm noticed that almost all these palettes is wrong (more or less).
<br />
<br />It is have one old japanese web page where author trying to get completely accurate FC palette.
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011225205245/http://refam.virtualave.net/iro/">http://web.archive.org/web/200112252052 ... e.net/iro/</a><!-- m -->
<br />(you can get refam.pal with latest fceumm build in one arch.)
<br />
<br />I've compared some game shots from emulator with this and standatr palette (FCEU's ones of course) and noticed that refam.pal in some cases is much accurate than default, but it is have some difference with original too...
<br />
<br />It is hard to me to get normal screenshots from my TV with right color balance, so my comparinsons may be totally wrong, it is only my biassed view. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> 
<br />
<br />I not completely understand why japan palette should be accurate and how much accurate any other palettes... On which depends other's palette researching and which one can be names "most accurate"?
<br />
<br />Any real images in comparinson with emulated are welcome. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />To help solve this definitively, somebody is going to have to come up with the precise formula for the signal. This would involve looking at an NES composite video signal in an oscilloscope to see the true voltages for $x0 and $xD and confirm my hypothesis that it alternates between the two values in $x1 through $xC. (I <em>think</em> color burst is $08.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The reason nobody has come up with a correct palette is that it's <em>not possible</em>. The assumption that the color of a pixel depends only on the color index is at fault; the color of a pixel depends on the colors of neighboring pixels on the scanline, and on its alignment with regard to the PPU clock (I think there are three alignments). What I imagine is happening is that people are tuning palettes for particular combinations of neighboring pixels and alignments, so each palette matches only that subset of combinations it was tuned for. Then people go round and round, thinking they're making the palette more accurate, when they're just shifting the subset of cases it represents accurately.

<br />But a solid color screen of a given palette value <em>does</em> have a definite RGB value except at the edges (which lie mostly in overscan). Besides, it shouldn't apply at all to the PlayChoice PPU, which has an RGB output; has anybody dumped that?

<br />But at least it will look as correct as possible across as many games as possible without doing a full real-time emulation of the entire NTSC signal path. I guess we need to figure out how to make the best possible approximation of the colors on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMPTE_color_bars" class="postlink">SMPTE color bar card</a>.

<br />Note that I only <em>posted</em> it - Kevin Horton was responsible for actually extracting it. He'll also be extracting one of the "nonstandard" VS PPU palettes shortly (RP2C04-0001).

<br />Yes, it flickers; it's supposed to because some of the SMPTE reference colors lie between NES hues.

<br />
<br />Below is IMHO, the best NTSC palette thus far. I have done *very* little work to obtain these colors - as it is simply a hybrid of the hard work of AspiringSquire and FirebrandX on the ZSNES forum boards. I call this palette Trebor.pal (lol).  
<br />
<br />Using fbx.pal [Noted as FX] dated 11/22/2005 &amp; RealityB.pal [Noted as RB] dated 11/10/2005 along with NESten Palette Editor inside NESten 0.61 Beta 1:

<br />59/3B = FX 
<br />60/3C = FX 
<br />61/3D = RB 
<br />62/3E = RB 
<br />63/3F = RB 
<br />
<br />You get... tada...Trebor.pal 
<br />
<br />To explain further: 
<br />The blues, blacks, greys by AspiringSquire's RealityB.pal palette are the most accurate I have seen. 
<br />On the other hand, the reds, browns, greens in FirebrandX's fbx.pal are the most accurate I have seen as well. 
<br />Hence, the above hybrid. 
<br />My "accurate" statement is based on the following setup/equipment and observations. 
<br />
<br />1. Top Loader NES via Panasonic 27" TV. 
<br />2. Radeon 9800 Video Card connect to same television via S-Video. 
<br />3. Television screenshots of the NES from other individuals. 
<br />
<br />IMHO, the above "hybrid" of palettes is the best I have seen for NES NTSC colors. I know there's no *real* technical validity behind the palette.  Nonetheless, just thought I share and see if anyone here had any thoughts or comments.  I came across this 'latest' thread on palettes and thought it was appropriate to post here.  Accept my apologizes if this offends anybody.
<br />
<br />-Trebor
<br />
<br />UPDATE:
<br />Here's the palette:
