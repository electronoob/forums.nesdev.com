Flash works perfectly (if you don't <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=6865" class="postlink">leave one of the address pins floating</a>, that is!). To handle writing, Flash /CS goes to /CART (50 on edge connector), and /OE goes to ROM /CS from the MMC1, and of course /WE goes to /WR on the bus. This was a 512K Flash, so A18 was wired to a CHR bank output of the MMC1. Sweet Home and Zelda both ran successfully on this.<br /><br />Writing to Flash worked fine, as predicted. I selected the 16K bank at $8000 via the MMC1 PRG register, then wrote to the Flash there, repeated for each 16K bank. Programming the flash involves alternating writes with the high bit set and clear, so the MMC1 shift register gets reset and thus no registers get modified. Resetting the shift register sets bits 2 and 3 of the $8000 MMC1 register, but that's the mode I have it in, so no problem.<br /><br />The next step is to add the ability to disable the MMC1, and make CHR RAM read-only. This involves a resistor+diode pair each. That's being wired as I write this...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Wed Aug 18, 2010 12:14 pm</p><hr />

I think the NES could run sequential code directly off if it, but I don't see how that could work for random accesses like the NMI/reset vectors, branches, jumps and stuff like that.  So you still pretty much need a normal memory chip.  The rev3 Squeedo will have some extra stuff in there to tie it all together, so my design isn't really made to be inexpensive.  It definitely will be cheaper than the PowerPak though (and far more capable for development).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Aug 16, 2010 11:37 am</p><hr />

Sure, a custom design would be best, but I'm more interested in something that will actually happen, hence the incremental approach. If we get this minimal-modifications-to-existing-board working, then someone can do something like you propose, with more confidence of success and the ability to build on our software etc.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Thu Aug 05, 2010 5:49 am</p><hr />

Thanks for pointing that out Memblers. As it turns out, we haven't used Ultima Exodus, it was just the first that came to mind. Bards Tale and NES Open Tournament Golf have been ones that I have actually used, and they have the MMC1B2 and MMC1B3 inside. That should save us some trouble.<br /><br />EDIT: I just checked the bootgod database, and Ultima Exodus does, in fact, have an MMC1B chip inside, not the MMC1A. If you have a strange version with a different revision MMC1 inside, you should post that information to the bootgod database.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=450">arfink</a> — Tue Aug 03, 2010 9:13 am</p><hr />

Hm, here's an idea maybe, for modding mappers to work with flash.  If the mapper covers a $8000-$FFFF normally, maybe a 74hc139 or 138 could be used on the enable to move it to $0800-$7800.  So a latch at $8001 would show up at $0801.  It would also end up overwriting zero-page RAM and breaking compatibility, so it's kind of debatable if it's even worth it at that point (though I guess further mods could avoid that, but it's getting to be quite a lot of rewiring by now).<br /><br />Also BTW Ultima Exodus was the cart that I had modified to take an EPROM a long time ago (and haven't used it much, really since my development tests had typically been pretty small).  Before I had a ROM programmer and emulator, I had put some stuff together and had it burned but it didn't work right because of it being MMC1A and starting in a different bank than all the emulators (at that time).  Later then, on my Squeedo cart (so I can just use the highest bank for the loading code) I had put a resistor network as pullups on the address lines so it could start up properly.  I didn't think of that until now, this MMC1A random bank startup is another potential problem for a flash cartridge.  You need vectors in every bank.  The loader code could just reserve $FFF0+ in every 32kB and be OK I think, then point the NMI and IRQ vectors into RAM so user programs can put JMPs there (or rather, the load code copies the vectors there).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">They could have a whole set devcarts using different mappers.<br /></div><br />But once you have three such carts, you might as well buy a PowerPak, unless you're developing for an unsupported mapper</div><br /><br />And then you might as well buy a <a href="http://www.moates.net/product_info.php?cPath=68&amp;products_id=169" class="postlink">ROM emulator</a>, heheh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat Jul 31, 2010 8:10 pm</p><hr />

You can buy a lot of cheap donor carts for the price of a PowerPak... Of course you still have to consider the Flash memory, but at least the PC connection would be shared between all carts.<br /><br />I'm saying this because I'm not the biggest fan of the MMC1, and I think that a development solution that's limited to a single mapper (and its few subsets) is not that useful.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Jul 31, 2010 7:37 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, it adds I guess $5 or so to the cost of parts.  I don't think RS232 is as robust and universal when bit-banged, half-duplex mode is fine but the NES can't do anything else (not easily) while it's waiting for input.  Kinda harder to use from the NES side.  But oh well, either way the NES and PC software is pretty much compatible with both hardware types.  Also, I'm sure there would be a USB PIC18 in DIP package if that helps for people building it themselves.<br /><br />Would be cool to use it with older hardware too.  I think I looked it up for the Atari 8-bit and C64 and (IIRC) it was 0V-5V RS232, so no adapter is even needed for those, just connectors.<br /><br />I might make a cartridge like that, sounds kinda fun, I have a feeling it may be useful once more communication adapters are around.  These type of carts can work with CopyNES, too.  I could use DIP parts, but it's more expensive for the RAM.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Jul 30, 2010 10:13 pm</p><hr />

As far as I'm concerned, the board is interesting, but not right away. I want these so that they can be provided to people at cost, but people can also still build them for themselves. A design which uses existing carts can do that more easily, I think, than a custom PCB. But if you can build it, I'm sure people would be interested in such a thing.<br /><br />As far as using serial, I understand how ideal it would be to use a PIC, but right now we don't want to deal with writing drivers, and RS232 has the advantage of being very robust and universal across OSes. I have commented to Blargg that I'd like to use this with my Apple IIgs, even if just for kicks. Blargg mentioned this is his other thread here:<br /><br />[quote=blargg]A big benefit of using serial (even if just a USB-serial adaptor) is that the host-side drivers use a well-worn protocol. You don't have to mess with special drivers or communication models when using serial, so it's easy to port to different operating systems. That's not to say you couldn't have a microcontroller with a USB interface to the PC acting like a serial device, but giving the NES a clocked interface (maybe that was your point). If someone wants to release such a cable for the NES, please do![/quote]<br /><br />Lastly, while this cartridge is a cool idea for NES development and could have alot of potential, I think that our primary goal has not been to make a cheap cartridge with lots of cool development features, but a cheap cartridge for non-devs to use homebrew.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=450">arfink</a> — Fri Jul 30, 2010 9:03 pm</p><hr />
