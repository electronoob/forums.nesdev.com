I got alot of help/assistance from users here, in getting my custom mmc5 irq to fire up.<br /><br />in my Zelda hack, I have 2 separate irq sequences, and they work perfectly within fceux.<br /><br />Now someone tested my rom on an etrom board, and one of my irq sequences wouldn't fire up.<br /><br />I then loaded nintendulator &amp; nestopia, and I went to the 2 separate irq sequences in my game, and neither emulator fired up my irqs.<br /><br />I am completely lost now at this point...<br /><br />edit: this is strange. Nintendulators debugger. One of my irq sequences obviously isn't working. I randomly clicked the debug box, and my entire BG was gittery garbage. But when I unclicked the debug box, my irq sequence appeared and functioned the way its supposed to. Am I missing something?

Am I missing something?</div><br /><br />The PPU debugger can behave &quot;strangely&quot; with mappers like the MMC5, since it's constantly changing CHR banks as the screen is rendered and the debugger doesn't take that into account (it just looks at the currently mapped banks and uses them to preview the entire nametable). Actually requesting the CHR data through the MMC5 wouldn't work, since the mere act of reading from memory would change the mapper's internal state (just as it would with the MMC2 and MMC4).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />These were suggestions made in a PM, putting them here in case someone else wants to help in the future:<br /><br />1. You don't seem to be Initializing RAM in your reset code. Doing this would eliminate a large potential source of differences between emulators.<br /><br />2. You must always read $5204 in your IRQ routine before RTI, or it gets stuck in an infinite loop firing the IRQ over and over again (until the NMI overrides it).<br /><br />3. Write to $5203 before you turn on the scanline IRQ.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Create a trace log in FCEUX and one in Nintendulator from power on. Read them side by side, and figure out where they start to diverge. My guess, based on the last version of your ROM I saw is that they will start to diverge before the second NMI fires). Once you know what is different, you can work on fixing it so that they are both the same.<br /><br />Remember all the conditions for an IRQ to fire, and check each of them. Is the scanline set via $5023? Is the IRQ enabled via $5024? Is the IRQ inhibit flag on or off, etc. ? Also make sure all of the other IRQs are inactive.

I'm back again with my irq for mmc5.<br /><br />My romhack ive worked on, im at the very end of finishing this, but I'm running into an issue that's springing up and I don't know how to stop it from happening.<br /><br />My irq will violently fluctutate if Link shoots his sword zap, or any other type of sprite action. my split screen works properly, can be adjusted at any height with not issue.<br /><br />If I do a read breakpoint of $5204, and constantly hit run while the irq is in mid screwup, I can see the scanline #fluctuate all over the place, then once the error stops, the scanline is doing it's correct positions.<br /><br /><br />The scanline values that are correct properly within the debugger are..<br />66, near top, 106, middle, 144, near bottom<br /><br />But, if decide to shot my sword zap, then perform the read breakpoint, and click run, the scanline goes all over the place.<br /><br />Id appreciate any help, this is the only thing stopping me from finishing my project, idk if im missing something or what. Thanks for reading!<br /><br /><strong>edit</strong><br /><br />oh man....<br /><br />I just did this as a test. I froze my ram register that loads a dpcm sfx id..... My irq no longer fluctuates.... But my sword zap is a dpcm sfx which I need. As long as no dpcm is taking place, my mmc5 irq is ok....<br /><br />Now I don't know what to do. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Idk how to make the dpcm and my custom mmc5 irq coexist?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I honestly don't know. Does it have anything to do with $4010? I can't remember the dpcm register off the top of my head. The Zelda engine never had a constant split screen going on during dpcm playback, so idk if the engine is intact lacking something, or if I'm just overlooking something. The only thing I've ever messed with in regards to dpcm, is shifting the sample sfx positions and sizes.<br /><br />So I need to turn something off within dpcm?<br /><br />Hmm, I think I got it! After my cli, I added LDA #$00 $STA $4017.<br /><br />my sword zap works still, and my mmc5 scanline isn't going haywire! I'll keep trying different sprite actions to make absolute sure I got this. Thank you very much for helping with this!
