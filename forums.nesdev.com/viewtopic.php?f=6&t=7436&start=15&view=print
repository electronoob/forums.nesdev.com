<br />Good idea. I added an (untested) example of ISR-switching code to the wiki article. It reserves three bytes of RAM, changing the first to RTI while the address is half written.

<br />Personally, to solve this problem I just wait for VBlank before modifying the pointer, that way I know for sure that the process will not be interrupted. Another solution in my particular case is to temporally clear bit 7 of the high byte of the pointer (that will make the NMI know that there's no custom handler defined, so none will be called) and then set the lower byte followed by the high byte. I guess I prefer to wait for VBlank though. I have also used tepples' solution in other programs.

<br />GemVenture uses a similar system, as do my other works in progress.  Wraith also used such a system, but it was much cruder.  My understanding is that BattleToads also used something like it, although I've never looked myself so I could be wrong.
<br />
<br />IMHO, the tricky part is making sure the sound code is robust to timing conflicts, like if your 'start sound effect' routine get interrupted by an NMI.  But it was discussed earlier and I think tokumaru came up with a pretty good solution: <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=70941#70941" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=70941#70941</a>

<br />This exact problem could be avoided easily. Every sound effect channel could have a flag that shows it is 'active' (you probably have one to tell the player to not process the channel when there is no effect). Initially it reset, you also reset it when a sound effect ends and <em>starts</em> (i.e. in the very beginning of 'play effect' routine). You only set it when you have initialized the effect, so all the variables are set already. Player will not process a half-initialized effect then.

<br />
<br />I use the NMI way.  I have a generalized VRAM update buffer that gets filled with updates in the game logic.  When NMI occurs my NMI routine dumps the buffer to VRAM.  My sound driver is called in the NMI after the VRAM updates are finished.
<br />
<br />The only commercial game I have ever examined in any depth is The Guardian Legend, which I think is a pretty complex game.  They use the NMI approach too.  Here is an outline of The Guardian Legend's NMI routine:

<br />What is the point in turning off the PPU?
<br />
<br />Is the game guarding against overrunning the real vblank during updates, or is there another reason?

The same way you can have a single loop with the VBlank waiting and PPU updates at the end, you can separate the PPU updates into their own routine, but still keep them in the same file, at the exact same position. There doesn't need to be a difference in code size or organization between techniques.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Enable DMC playback every frame?

<br />I'm wondering the same thing. AFAIK, VRAM can be accessed freely during VBlank without the need to turn rendering off. Unless the updates go past the end of VBlank, like you said.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Don't really get how it could help. Usually there is no real need to have register update before VRAM magic (on NTSC NES at least), because the VRAM magic could only take relatively short time, jitter not going to be noticeable. The problem is when you have VRAM update in main 'thread', not in NMI handler, and the code could lag (take more than one frame) - the lag is the reason why you could need to have VRAM update outside of the NMI handler, and the reason why you need to have sound update in the interrupt (NMI or other).
<br />
<br />If you have VRAM update in NMI, there is no problem with sound update, you just need different project design and more complex code.
<br />
<br />Anyway, judging by what people have said in this thread, the NMI way is the correct one. Seems that other way I've thought of as the most promising one - using frame counter interrupt - will not work. It almost works, but not good enough - it misses updates, so music lags sometimes, rarely and at random places, but too noticeable to be acceptable.
