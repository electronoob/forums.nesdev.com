		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was successful in getting the game to run it's PRG-ROM properly as an MMC3 rom. The gfx are still a wip, but gameplay/music/sfx are all intact and work properly.<br /><br />I've been in the process of creating my MMC3 chr routines so that the gfx can be displayed properly, but i'm having difficulty.<br /><br />The MMC2 is able to swap the ppu consistently without any visual changes from loading 2 different pages at once within $1000-$1FFF. And it's able to do this without an irq/sprite 0 going on.<br /><br />Within MTP, PPU $1000-$1FFF is the one that gets the most attention. I'm able to get <strong>some</strong> of the gfx to properly load, but, all the games text, crowd, various icons, are within the first chr page, page 0. This is somehow loaded and stored into the PPU, so that 3 different things are being displayed. <br />     1, current chr page within $0-$FFF PPU. <br />     2, current chr page within $1000-$1FFF ppu. <br />     3, chr page 0 from $1000-$1FFF ppu.<br /><br />I have tried various different methods of trying to get a 3rd PPU set to be stored into mmc3's $8001-$8001 for display within $1000-$1FFFppu, I tried making it load 00 as either A &amp; Y, storing into $8000-1,A $8000-1,Y, but I don't get the correct desired result.<br /><br />I tried using register $1E which I believe is a frame counter, to AND 01, and load page 0 into PPU $1000-$1FFF, and if it's not AND 01, to continue displaying what was currently in $1000-$1FFF, it swaps, but it displays the 2 pages swapping on screen.<br /><br />Then, I tried creating an interrupt using $FFFE, I would force a BRK so that $FFFE would point to my LDA #$00 to store into $1000-$1FFF, but all that does is simply overtake $1000-$1FFF, meaning it's just constantly displaying page 0.<br /><br />So what I would like to know is, does MMC3 have a way to load chr tiles from other chr pages that are not currently within the ppu, <strong>without</strong> splitting the screen like in Super Mario Bros. 3?<br /><br />The only way I've ever seen this was with SMB3, but it uses an irq split to load a 3rd chr page. <br /><br />So is there any way of using an interrupt to display a 3rd chr page within $1000-$1FFF? Once I can figure this out, MTP will be finished and completed as an MMC3 conversion.<br /><br />Thank you!<br />-infidelity

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Have you been studying the behavior of MMC2? It banks on access to specific tile ranges. This type of banking is not possible in the MMC3. For one, the MMC3 does not connect the required CHR-ADDR lines needed to decode those accesses.<br /><br />I don't think there's any way to convert MTP to MMC3 without re-writing the sprite engine. And if you do that, then you'd need to do some pretty awesome character banking based on the scan-line interrupt.<br /><br />You might want to just buy a cart <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

And anything text related and various sprites are within $1000-$1FFF.<br /><br />That's why I was wondering if there was a way to use the mmc3's irq to load a 3rd chr set without a scanline.

You want an interupt without a scanline?  The MMC3 interupts are based on a counter that's decremented for each sensed scanline.  No scanlines = No IRQ's from the mapper.  Additionally the irq doesn't load chr sets.  The mapper interupts the CPU and then the CPU would be changing the chr set on the MMC3.  The MMC2 is inherently different in the fact that the CPU doesn't control bankswitching aside from what tiles it draws where for the PPU.

You may have to do some bank rearranging if more than one switch occurs during a scanline or if it draws sprites from both pattern tables.

I've been doing several attempts at doing it, looking at how other mmc3 roms do it, reading tutorials online on how to do it, but I just can't do it. I didn't think i'd run into this kind of issue with the CHR. <br /><br />Thanks for all the replies everyone.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The game could probably be converted if you got into exactly how the game is using the feature of the MMC2 and then reprogramming it to get the same effect with MMC3 scanline interrupts. But you may need to reprogram and change other things if that isn't enough. <br /><br />I don't think it would be an easy task.
