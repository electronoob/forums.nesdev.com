You're being SO much <strong>smart</strong> than I though, but you're AS annoying AS jargon was here. I don't mind if you're <em>scoring points with the mod</em>, but it seems *I* am losing points. <br /><br />Anyway, I won't go into deep details.

it's been a topic of heated contention in all gaming circles i've come in contact[heh, pun] with...why do some swear by it and others claim it destroys the cart? personally i've developped a ritual over the years of dry blowing into the cartridge, then breathing hot air along the top edge of the board, inserting it quickly, and tucking the cartridge into the rightmost position after it's down by grasping the two closest corners and shimmying it to the right until it doesn't go any further. <br /><br />i'm sorry for sharing that to those who have weak stomachs, i know it might seem perverse, I blame my backwards twisted upbringing.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3693">Roni</a> — Tue Nov 25, 2008 12:12 pm</p><hr />

The problem is NOT "who cares". It was hard to convince about jargon's annoying pattern, as "not breaking any rule" or "trolling for side discussions". If he's banned, it was expected his return under other nick, and smart to avoid ISPs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=39">Zepper</a> — Tue Nov 11, 2008 7:07 pm</p><hr />
