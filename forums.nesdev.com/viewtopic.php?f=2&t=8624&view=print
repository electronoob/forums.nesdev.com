<br />
<br />When can you change individual sprite positions during a scan line (not via dma)?  I read some PPU cycles are dedicated to backgrouns and some to sprites per scan line, but I wonder how it applies?

<br />If he had to start this topic, he probably doesn't think so. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> Also, "a lot" is a concept that varies greatly depending on what you're making.

<br />I'm getting off topic, but all that the DMA does is do 256 writes to $2004, technically. So if DMA works, direct writes to $2004 should work too ? I have never tried it as there is no advantages in doing it this way (it just takes more time), but if you perform the writes before the end of VBlank (which should be easy with an unrolled loop) then I can't see how it could fail and how it differs from DMA.
<br />
<br />Back on the topic, I think you can do odd things with $2004 <em>reading</em> during the frame. This was quite obscure as the behavior was different depending on the model of the NES/Famicom you used and the PPU revision. Most people doesn't have 20 different NESes/Famicoms to test their programs on it for exact behavior of different revisions so this is highly problematic to test.
<br />
<br />On some systems like the C64, sprite mulitplexing is common and even essential if you want to display more than 8 sprites at all. I remember writing a cool multiplexing engine for it then loosing both the source code and the compiled result <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />The C64 however is very different as VRAM is shared with RAM (it's the same memory chip, VRAM is just a part of normal RAM) and the acesses are interleaved between the video chip and the CPU, so you can write to any register anytime and it takes effect immediately. Also sprites are part of normal VRAM, there is no such thing as OAM. The price for this is a very slow CPU (1 MHz only).

<br />I remember noticing the same but didn't care to figure out the exact reason because the DMA is there and works. It may have something to do with the value that the OAM address (controlled by $2003) ends up with. You could try resetting it to $00 after writing the sprites.
<br />
<br />EDIT: typo

<br />
<br />Technically you could use almost 3/4 of the page for whatever you want, right?  Just make sure to set all the y-coord bytes to an off-screen value, then put data in the other three bytes.  Yeah you're DMAing garbage to the PPU but who cares?
<br />
<br />Oh...I suppose that might get glitchy though when the PPU hits the 8-sprite-per-sccanline limit and starts picking the wrong bytes as y-coord.  Hm.

<br />
<br />That stuff simply doesn't matter if the sprites are offscreen anyway.  It won't affect the display of visible sprites, or affect how Sprite 0 collision works.  It just means you'll get slightly different results from the ever-unreliable sprite collision flag that nobody should use anyway.
