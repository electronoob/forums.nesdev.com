Yeah but even still it don't work because CV3 japanese does clear the counter at start of VBlank and add 20 to count value (when I run CV3 japanese on my powerpak, the status bar is always invisible/glitchy because all IRQs are fired during VBlank (I think). I haven't tried the other VRC games but I think it'd be the same crap.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Feb 19, 2010 11:32 am</p><hr />

The less code, the easier it will be to figure out the cause.  Like mentioned above, your game doesn't work with Nintendulator. This is already a big issue. By reducing the code to only the title screen at first, this should help you figure out where the game fail since you only have the presentation screen to analyze. Once the title screen work, you add back the rest of the code and see if it still fail. Then you can start to debug the next part.  Just see it as iterative debugging.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Denine wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Convert mapper to VRC-6<br /></div><br />If I have to do something more than change number in header,then that's maybe a big problem  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /></div><br /><br />Unfortunately, yes you will have to do more. When you use a mapper like the VRC6, you will need to set the default state of the banks for the PRG ones and CHR one. Without that, only the fixed bank will be working right. If I can make that VRC6 sample for famitracker I will put the default bank initialization in it. That should be enough for the current state of your game.   I started a little bit yesterday to convert it but in ca65 the sample was not working properly with the sample music I included. I don't know the cause yet (driver bug or my code).  The volume of the song goes haywire after a few songs were switched. If you only use one song maybe this will not be an issue for now.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />I checked the rom and there seems to be some CHR-ROM appended to the end of the file. After tracing your code from the rom, you're trying to use mapper 2 when you don't seems to copy the data in CHR-RAM. What I did is changing the mapper number back to 0 and it's now started to work in Nintendulator.  Menu was shown but it fail in the game if not in PAL mode. So it seems that Nestopia/FCEX try to load some CHR-ROM even thought the mapper say it's RAM.<br /><br />As for the vector, only reset is defined at 8000, NMI and IRQ are not.  My guess is your game does too much writing and it spill outside VBLANK but I could be wrong. If I remember well, PAL vblank is longer so this could be the reason that it works in PAL.  You will have a lot of re-factoring to do in your game to make it work properly but this is all part of the learning experience.

I guess it must be related to the prototype you shown in the music thread.<br /><br />Since you want to use VRC music, you have to take this into consideration:<br />- You need to change the mapper for VCR-6 one in your code<br />- If you make your game on a real cart (not with powerPak), only 3 japanese carts support this mapper: Akumajou densetsu, Madara, Esper Dream 2. Those carts don't use the same port for music too.<br />- The music will only run on a famicom unless you modify your nes and adapter to make it work<br /><br />If you still go that way then the first thing to do before your game goes too far in development will be to find the cause of the bugs. Your game doesn't work well on the 2 most accurate emulators.  On Nintendulator the title screen doesn't show at all and in Nestopia it freeze after the title screen.<br /><br />There is good chances that the problems are related but trying to debug all in one shot would be hard. I would suggest to:<br /><br />- Create test rom with title code only <br />- Convert mapper to VRC-6<br />- Start to test on both emulator to see where it fail<br /><br />Good change it's something related to vblank.  Once this work, you cart start to add more of the game code and see if it's still fail.<br /><br />This is how I would approach it: convert to VRC-6, start to test title and increase the test code part by part.  If you do thing your prg-bank code is fine then first fix the display bugs before converting to VRC-6. That could be an easier path actually.<br /><br />edit:<br /><br />About the 16 banks thing, Tepples is right, make sure the vectors are defined in the last bank.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Thu Feb 18, 2010 11:26 pm</p><hr />

First make sure all your vectors (nmi, reset, and irq) point somewhere in the last bank. Otherwise, the NES doesn't know which bank to switch in at power-on to find your startup code.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Feb 18, 2010 6:19 pm</p><hr />
