		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well after working on it for a few days, I got a LOT added because of that topic that was about bad time layouts. Well, yeah, about 8 hours of work evenly distributed and I changed how the code works alot (To your disgust, everything is now done in VBlank, but I am going to probably change it as I near the end of the project) and I got eneough progress to show it to you guys. Thanks so much, guys. Without all of your help, none of this would be possible. I am putting this on a cart and testing it later, but it should work. Right now it's NROM-128 but it might change if any other games are added.
<br />

<br />
<br />Well, tell me what you think. After seeing how much space in the ROM I have, I am probably going to make 20 or so items that drop each level and increase the difficulty a little each level. The game WILL end, but trust me, no everyone will be able to do it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />
<br />Yet again.....if this forum didn't exist.....this probably would never be made. Thanks guys. Have fun messing around with this demo.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you are taking criticism, I think that the graphics need a serious upgrade. Even if you are not the greatest artist ever, at least you should make better use of what the system has to offer.
<br />
<br />The water barrels, for example, have only 2 colors, blue and brown. NES sprites have 3 colors, so why not use the third color to make the barrels look more interesting?
<br />
<br />Also, the tiny guy that throws the bombs. Why is he so tiny? It would be so cool if he had a more discernible face with different expressions depending on what was going on... I mean, even in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwrZHu-d-vY" class="postlink">Atari 2600 version</a> he is larger and more detailed than in your version. If you pay attention, games that were originally on the 2600 and were converted to more capable machines always had added detail. For example, check out these updated versions of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXItN8PLmdo" class="postlink">River Raid</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cg_zejkNco" class="postlink">Keystone Kapers</a>, where the backgrounds have been slightly improved.
<br />
<br />Drawing backgrounds on the 2600 is not easy, but on the NES there's absolutely nothing stopping you from drawing an interesting background. Add some texture to that wall (I think it's a wall, at least), clouds to the sky, things like that.

<br />
<br />
<br />Yeah, it's just a demo. Game stuff to be added after I get all the subroutines in place and stuff laid 100% out.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Tokumaru, I have one pallet left over. I can expand the main character 3 characters wide, maybe even four. Would that be better? And for the bombs, I have a color pallet and then for the paddles I have one color pallet. I have one character pallet left over. I wanted to add a santa clause hat on the guy as a joke, but I guess I could over lap another character over the top two with the water that change for when a bomb hits it and take out the light blue for the bucket hit character and add two other colors, brown and black. Would that be good? Then use the extra 6 sprites to show when water hits the buckets and have four colors of blue to show water and water hit? It will add two colors of brown/tan to show bucket detail and add three colors for water detail. And plus I could also have some water show above the bucket, like the real game.
<br />
<br />
<br />Yeah, criticism is liked, just don't say it sucks too bad. It's an early alpha. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />
<br />And yeah, I am going to add nice backgrounds later once I get the actual game mechanics done. I have lots of background stuff to play with. :3

<br />
<br /><img src="http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/9092/kaboom0.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />With the sprites arranged like that you can easily animate his hands when he drops the bombs, which should look interesting. I really think it's important that you stop drawing things so tiny... Since the basic design of this game doesn't require that many sprites be aligned horizontally, you can go crazy and use larger, more detailed objects. IMO you should even use 8x16 sprites, that way you'll be able to draw a lot of bombs without ever having to flicker anything.
<br />
<br />The background obviously needs more detail too, but I don't have the time to do more mock-ups right now. You should definitely try to add buildings and clouds to the top part of the screen, and turn the green part into a wall with missing bricks, graffiti, things like that.
<br />
<br />If you like my sprites, feel free to use them, I don't even want credit or anything. If you want to use them for inspiration when drawing yours, no problem. If you hate them, that's OK too, just forget I ever posted them. =)

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I definitely think I will use those. I'll put them into my game later and animate them later....And every sprite I use, the less bombs will go onto the screen. And that bucket picture is very great too. I am understanding now to get detail by using the same color, just in more conectration, I take it because when the user isn't focusing on it, it just looks like a gradient and not like pixelated images? Dude, I'm so using those as inspiration. I love those. And the animated hands are a great idea too. Thanks so much for those ideas.

<br />Are you talking about the dithering? Because of the way the NES outputs video, the outcome of dithered patterns is somewhat unpredictable. When dithering graphics, it's a good idea to test them on a real NES or at least using the NTSC filter present in some emulators before deciding on the final patterns. I know I had to do a lot of testing until I was satisfied with the dithering patterns I used to shade the walls in my raycaster...

<br />ALSO:

<br />I have a bug. If paddle is on the very left of the screen, hit detection goes crazy for some reason. I'll fix it later, kthxbai.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />
