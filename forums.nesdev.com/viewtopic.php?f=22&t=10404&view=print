		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />With the recent rise of reproduction topics on NESdev BBS, some people have become worried about legality, morality, and forum clutter. There have been <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=10395" class="postlink">calls to clean it up</a>. As one step toward cleaning it up, I've decided to make a list of games whose author allows everyone to reproduce and sell them. I'll start by listing NES games that I'm aware of that are free as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_Free_Software_Guidelines" class="postlink">DFSG</a>:<br /><ul><li>Concentration Room (by Damian Yerrick, GNU GPL) </li><li>Double Action Blaster Guys (by Joshua Hoffman) </li><li>Escape from Pong (by Adam Gashlin, 3-clause BSD) </li><li>LAN Master (by Shiru, CC0) </li><li>Lawn Mower (by Shiru, CC0) </li><li>NES15 (by Mathew Brenaman, 2-clause BSD) </li><li>RHDE: Furniture Fight (32K version) (by Damian Yerrick, GNU All-Permissive) </li><li>Russian Roulette (by Damian Yerrick, GNU All-Permissive) </li><li>Thwaite (by Damian Yerrick, GNU GPL) </li><li>Zap Ruder (by Damian Yerrick, GNU All-Permissive) </li><li>Zooming Secretary (by PinWizz and Shiru, CC-BY) </li><li><a href="http://nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&amp;threadid=129587" class="postlink">The 1007 Bolts</a> (by User, CC0)</li></ul><br />This list may look familiar to you. Several of the games on this list are included in a series of <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=9393" class="postlink">multicarts sold as a fundraiser</a> for future NESdev competitions. But I'm under the impression that the permission for many of the other games in that compilation is specific to that fundraiser.<br /><br />So anyway, if you've developed a playable homebrew game for NES or Super NES, and you're fine with people making carts of your game and selling them on eBay or the like, list it here. Even no-derivatives licenses (CC BY-ND) are fine for purposes of repros, as long as they don't have a non-commercial (-NC) clause.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You may list the ones with ND (and others that aren't OSI/FSF/DFSG compatible) in a separate list (although in the same message); I think this would be useful too. It might be useful also to have a link to a wiki article to specify any possible trademark issues and accepting donations and of course if you want information about the game itself such as how to download.<br /><br />For me, personally, this list can be useful for a project I intend to do in the future; I can put many or all of them (including ones for GameBoy and so on), together with emulators, and some games I might write myself (which might be emulated and/or native code), on some DVD which is included with a computer system. I may make (one-time) donations to the original authors, if I do this.<br /><br />The game I made &quot;Famicom Hangman&quot; is also free software and I allow anyone to make reproduction and sell it or whatever if they want to. However, it is untested (I do not currently own any NES or Famicom hardware), and there may be trademark issues with some of the included phrases (being able to mark them may be helpful in case you need to remove them). You might want to correct one or both of these issues in order to included it in such a list, but I don't know if it is or not.

We (including Kulor, the author of the music) aren't negotiated an exact license, so I couldn't put one on this game. However, Denis gave me right to decide whatever to do with the NES version, so making repros for personal use is fine. Porting the game to other retro platforms is fine too, but better to ask Denis first (he allows it generally). Porting it to modern platforms isn't OK, as Denis have his own commercial (extended and improved) version(s) of the game for modern platforms.
