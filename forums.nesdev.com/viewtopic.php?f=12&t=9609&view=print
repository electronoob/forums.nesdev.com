		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />hi there. i would like to make some snes repos. what type of programmer and adapter do i need to write to dip-36 eprom? all the willem programmers i see for sale have a spot for dip 32 but dont i need to write to dip 36? i really want to use tsop flash ram for obvious reasons. the tsop40 to dip 36 off buyicnow looks like what i need but i would like to know if can i write to the tsop once i have mounted it onto the dip adapter or what kind of socket adapter id need otherwise. thanks. <br /><br />ps: ive seen a lot of impatient replies scolding people for not searching/ researching enough due to multi posting. if you can find a relevant post please link me. it would be much appreciated. most of the topics i find are 7-10 years old and dont mention tsop. thanks again.<br /><br />is this all i need? <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sivava.com/EPROM_Programmer_5P4.html">http://www.sivava.com/EPROM_Programmer_5P4.html</a><!-- m -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The BuyICNow adapter board is what you want (version III).  However, the 36-pin MaskROM pinout is not standard, and you will need an adapter of some kind to rearrange the pinout to make it work with a programmer.  And yes, this has been discussed many times, basically anything referring to SNES repros with TSOPs is going to be that same chip on that same board, and will be directly relevant to your purposes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />so can i program the tsop flash chip once mounted to dip 36 type iii or do i need a tsop 40 socket adapter for my programmer to write to the tsop before mounting to the type iii converter?<br /><br />*edit* <br />Woah looks like this person is doing what i hope to. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://retrohacker.info/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=6">http://retrohacker.info/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=6</a><!-- m --> . they just got a dip 32-36 adapter and just wrote to the type iii chip adapter with the flash mounted on it. looks simple enough to me. ive seen video where someone was programming the flash with a tsop 40 to dip 32 socket adapter. those things seem to run you over $40 cad. <br /><br />any ideas where/which to buy? i just need a willem programmer and then a dip32-36 socket adapter now? i wanna order asap so i can make some super cool snes gifts for xmas. (10 days away)<br /><br />is this all i need other than the tsop chips and type iii converter? <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sivava.com/EPROM_Programmer_5P6.html">http://www.sivava.com/EPROM_Programmer_5P6.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />it comes with this thing <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sivava.com/buynow.php?pd=B11">http://www.sivava.com/buynow.php?pd=B11</a><!-- m --> will this allow it to support up to 44pin chips?<br /><br />one last thing as well. does the speed and temp matter when choosing tsop. i know not to go higher than 120ns. but what about 70ns and 90ns at 70Â°c?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />One thing to consider, some programmers won't program this adapter board with the WE line being tied low or high.  Some will, but mine won't (ARLabs.com).  Mine needs to be able to control the WE otherwise, it won't program.  I made my own adapter board as a result (and cheaper than the buyIC now ones).   I also noticed that the type 1 adapters were too big and you have to cut/dremel the plastic protrusion inside the cart that hits it for a proper fit.  I don't know if the type 3 has the same issues.
