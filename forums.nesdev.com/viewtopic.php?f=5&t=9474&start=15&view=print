I know the NES AV path has a mild lowpass filter, but when using RF output such a filter would be entirely redundant since the signal will get a very strong lowpass from the RF modulation/demodulation process. I haven't checked famicom schematics to see if there is a similar filter, but I think it's kind of inconsequential since it normally only had RF output anyway.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">In fact, NSFplug has low and high-pass pre-sets for each of the console models that fairly accurately reflect how they sound (non-modded).

I don't have a way to verify it myself unless somebody wants to provide me with good reference recordings. I am trying to keep the default setting tuned to be like an NES AV out, though from comparing recordings from different NESes I have to try to average it out, since there's a fair bit of variation.<br /><br /><br />On another note, I'm back at home now, so I tried the stuff you did in your Famicom RF video tutorial but still no luck. I don't get anything output on channels 3 or 4 by my Famicom with my NES RF adapter, no matter which what I set the switches.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the &quot;audio path&quot; is completely different on various consoles.<br />As far I know :<br />NES : Many stages of amplification, ones involving a normally digital IC inverter, some involving transistors, and many stages of filtering with passive componants.<br />NES2 (toploader) : No amplification at all, just some passive componants and the output goes straight to the RF-box (or in the case of my modded console : To the output jack). I have to pull the volume louder to compensate for this, but the sound quality is perfectly OK.<br />Famicom : A single stage of amplification with a digital IC inverter, which is also used for some logic somewhere else. Very likely this will add a lot of noise, and non-linearities, to the output signal. I have no way to confirm this exept the famicom scematics which used to be there on the NESDEV main page.<br />New Famicom : Unknown<br /><br />It makes sense the sound would be low pass filtered when carried through RF as the bandwidth for the audio is limited. I think it's not much a good thing, I like square waves to sound crisp and clear <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />When it comes to power plugs, I have literally dozens of them at my home, it's very likely at least one of them would work on the FC. It's no use to use an official one, since it was made for 100V and we have 230V in my country, this would of course blow up everything.<br />10 V with reverse polarity is definitely something rare, 9V or 12V are more common. I'd assume 9V would work too, wouldn't it ? Since it takes DC as input, very likely it's directly connected to the 7705 linear regulator, which is normally robust. I don't know if there is a 7705 in the FC like there is in the NES though, pehaps they used a crappier/cheaper powering circuit which is more likely to blow up.

I know Canada is NTSC, but do you guys have some kind of weird channel difference (frequency-wise) than we do down here?  I.e. are Canadian TVs somehow different than the ones in the US?  It just doesn't make any sense.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I'm using an old CRT monitor and you're using an LCD monitor -- not that CRT vs. LCD has anything to do with it, but maybe the RF modulator in your LCD TV is &quot;less accepting&quot; or &quot;less friendly&quot; (I dunno how on a technical level) than my TV?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There is no difference between TVs sold in the U.S. and Canada, to my knowledge. I tested this on two TVs, one of which was actually purchased in California.<br /><br />If it's a shitty RF receiver problem, it's a problem with both TVs here. I dunno, since it seems to be increasingly uncommon to use a TV as a tuner for broadcast television (everyone I know seems to have a separate device supplied by the TV service), it could be that this feature is very poorly supported by a lot of modern TVs. It seems strange to me that this would be a problem with two televisions, though. (Also they have no problem with the regular NES RF signal on both channels 3 and 4.)<br /><br />Have you considered there might be something unusual in your setup that somehow puts the signal on channel 3 and 4? I haven't actually seen anyone suggest that this could be done with a Famicom before. Most people say use an NES RF adapter and use channel 95/96.

My TV is probably 10-15 year old CRT by RCA.<br /><br />The video quality is crap (kinda fuzzy/grainy) with that setup so modding over to A/V seems the only decent solution to get something that looks okay.  I'm curious as to how yours is working exactly koitsu, do you have more than one RF switch to test with?  I wonder if there is something special with that one, or do you have some sort of multi-input selector or other filter in there that could be doing something?
