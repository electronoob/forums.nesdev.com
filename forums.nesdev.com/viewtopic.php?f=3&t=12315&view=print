		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, cfxnes is an emulator I've been working on for some time. It's written in <s>CoffeeScript</s> JavaScript (ES6) and it currently supports the following:<br /><ul><li> nrom, unrom, cnrom, aorom, mmc1, mmc3 mappers (though there are some games that are still not working, like Super Mario Bros. 3).</li><li> Rendering using WebGL (with fallback to HTML canvas rendering).</li><li> Sound emulation using Web Audio.</li><li> Configurable controls.</li><li> Zapper.</li></ul><br />Known issues:<br /><ul><li> Low performance. I guess you'll need at least 2 GHz CPU. Using Chrome is strongly recommended, but Firefox should be also working.</li><li> Graphical glitches in some games (F-1 Race, Flintstones and some others). I'm currently trying fix this using PPU test ROMs.</li><li> Sound is a little bit rough.</li></ul><br />The emulator is running at <a href="http://cfxnes.herokuapp.com" class="postlink">http://cfxnes.herokuapp.com</a>, source code can be found here <a href="https://github.com/jpikl/cfxnes" class="postlink">https://github.com/jpikl/cfxnes</a>.<br /><br />Change log:<br />0.0.1 (2015-04-26)<br />-Complete rewrite from CoffeeScript to ECMAScript 6.<br /><br />Any comments are welcome. Thanks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Running my usual list of test games:<br />-Battletoads freezes after the intro. (That game is extremely timing sensitive.)<br />-Break Time doesn't work at all (probably this is due to a mistimed APU Frame IRQ or not waiting a frame before starting to set the PPU VBlank interrupt)<br />-Driar (homebrew game) doesn't work probably due to lack of support for undocumented CPU opcodes<br />-Slalom has lines that are displaced suggesting that you're using a PPU design that draws a whole line at a time. Sadly there's no way to deal with all the raster effects that the NES can do using a line at a time renderer.<br />-Shadow of the Ninja doesn't work<br /><br />Turning off the triangle wave should leave it outputting its current value instead of resetting it to zero (this is the cause of a lot of popping sounds)<br />Similarly, changing the fine period or duty cycle on the square waves should not reset them. Changing the coarse period should reset the counters though.  <br />Higher pitches are increasingly flat. Is there an off by one error on the counters for the square waves?<br />Resizing the window causes the audio pitch to change too. I know you're probably trying to compensate for framerate drops but it sounds terrible and takes a while to recover. You should run the APU for more cycles to fill the buffer instead.

I'm adjusting sampling rate to prevent audio buffer underflow/overflow and it's causing these transitions when framerate changes.
