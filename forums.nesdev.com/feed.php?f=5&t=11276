I've done things for the Master System, Commodore 64 and Amiga.<br /><br />Unfortunately I haven't finished many of my projects except for Driar, but I managed to get a <a href="http://csdb.dk/release/?id=109539" class="postlink">C64 game complete</a> and I have been working on a more complex project for quite some time. Early video can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zbq30kKCWA" class="postlink">here</a>. Haven't really touched the code for over a year though but hoping I can get the motivation to continue working on it some time soon.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=123">jayminer</a> — Mon Jun 02, 2014 2:31 pm</p><hr />

I tried dabbling in SNES and Amiga programming when I was in uni (1998-99 or so) but could never wrap my head around the complexity of the PPU/68000/Amiga chipset.  These last 2 months, though, I finally made a simple colour-mixing demo with HDMA effects on the SNES (as well as a DSP HiRom-&gt;LoROM hack) and I'm working on learning Amiga/68000 asm right now.  Some long-term ambitions are finally coming true.  Probably for some of you here, you know that this is a good feeling.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Anyway, among my programming efforts (all in ASM), I can list <strong>NES, Turbo/PCE, SNES, Commodore-64, Game Gear, Sega Master System, and <a href="http://www.chrismcovell.com/GamePokekon/index.html#program" class="postlink">Game Pocket Computer</a></strong> (which nobody really knows about,so I know how you feel, NovaSquirrel.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=355">ccovell</a> — Mon Jun 02, 2014 5:28 am</p><hr />

My first homebrew programs before NES were for Pokemon Mini, and later I've played with DS, Genesis and Atari 2600 but haven't really made anything for any of those.<br /><br />In the Pokemon Mini's case nobody I knew had one and that was discouraging (while many people have TI-84+s and I've written quite a bit for those), and SDK changes were breaking the DS projects I was altering to learn how to do things (and Android looks more appealing now), and the 2600's video hardware feels too annoying to someone used to the PPU doing most things for you.<br /><br />What I saw of the Genesis was very nice and I could see myself returning to it to write something later on; my first project for it was too ambitious and I think my NES projects have been successful because they've been small NROM programs where the size limitations cause me to design something that's easier to finish.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3838">NovaSquirrel</a> — Wed May 28, 2014 9:19 pm</p><hr />

I've made a hello world/sprite demo for GBC, and something similar for SNES. I had a really hard time getting anywhere with the SNES, but that was a long time ago when I was very inexperienced, and there wasn't really a forum out there for SNES development. I figure after my NES projects, I'll move on to GBC and SNES; I don't really care to go anywhere beyond that, though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Wed May 28, 2014 2:25 pm</p><hr />

Yes, I've created things for probably at least 15 different video game consoles and home computers (ranging from the ColecoVision to the Wii). I tend to limit myself to relatively small projects that I know I can get up and running in a matter of weeks, and where I won't have to create a lot of assets myself (since I can't compose music, and I'm no good at drawing).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1181">mic_</a> — Tue May 27, 2014 1:24 am</p><hr />

I have projects for the NES and the Atari 2600. There are other consoles I'd like to work with, but I promised myself I wouldn't until I completed any of my current projects. I hope to someday work with the Master System and the Game Boy / GBC, and possibly others, but 16 bits is where I draw the line... I have 0 interest in developing for anything newer than the Genesis/MD and the SNES.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon May 26, 2014 11:10 pm</p><hr />

I feel have a tendency to get in over my head. It's probably part of the reason I've never finished a homebrew project x.x. Personally in addition to NES homebrew, I've also been interested in making Gameboy and Atari 2600 games. In the future, I wouldn't mind expanding into other old home computers and consoles from the 80s and 90s. If I could, I would love to make an N64 game someday :3<br /><br />Someday...I will turn out something awesome. Until then...<br /><br />*Goes back to screwing around corrupting random ROMS xD* Ahhh...t'is so much easier to just screw around <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Also, I haven't posted here in eons. I really want to get back into NES homebrew. This time, I think I'll actually get help from this forum instead of being an anti-social twerp and try to do things on my own <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4838">WillBillXP</a> — Mon May 26, 2014 10:30 pm</p><hr />
