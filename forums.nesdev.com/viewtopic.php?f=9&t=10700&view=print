		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From my understanding the NES's video output is a little odd and runs at something more like 60.1 FPS. Reasons aside, this is typically okay as a TV will synchronize properly.<br /><br />In the age of digital displays and glorified capture devices, I've noticed sometimes this can cause problems:<br /><br />1) Video recordings drifting out of sync between audio and video<br />2) Screen tearing from framerate disagreements between the captured video and the output device<br /><br /><br />I am suffering from #2 as I have just acquired a nice 36&quot; 4:3 HD CRT. The bad thing about such a display is that it is modeled just like a regular LCD TV of today - an image processor takes old analogue inputs, processes them, scales them, then displays them on a fixed resolution display. In this case it is a CRT; the television does not change its scan rate to match the content.<br /><br />For my SFC, Sega Saturn, Dreamcast, etc. running through S-video this is no problem. For my Famicom through S-video with the NESRGB board, however, I notice screen tearing on scrolling on occasion and I suspect it is from this discrepancy in refresh rate. <br /><br />Is there anything I can do to this Famicom to make it output at a more &quot;correct&quot; frequency, even if this means slightly compromising the actual execution speed slightly?

Unfortunately I don't have Battletoads. Maybe I can talk to tim about the NESRGB maybe doing a little extra work to do what battletoads does to &quot;fix&quot; this problem, as it makes Famicom all but unplayable for me.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My LCD TV skips two frames every several seconds to take up the difference between the NES framerate and its own framerate. Two frames because it is running at 30hz interlacing pairs of frames (so it's skipping 1 displayed frame, 2 received frames).<br /><br />It bothered me a lot at first because I thought I had a bug in my scrolling code. Then I found it happening in every NES game I tried and realized it was the TV and not me.

And you can't do that generically without certain other effects, which may or may not pose problems to games that don't expect it.

It causes an error of 1 in ≈200000.<br /><br />The SNES uses the exact same field timing as the NES other than the missing pixel: just how confident are you that there's no tearing on the SFC?<br /><br />Assuming there actually is tearing on the SFC: It looks like the NESRGB is using the same 21MHz master clock to generate the 3.58MHz chroma signal as it feeds the PPU. If the NESRGB <strong>isn't</strong> gating the 21MHz clock, you might be able to split it and feed the PPU a 21.42MHz clock source (instead of the 21.47MHz clock source for the rest of the system); this is the same 1/380 error as the NTSC standard 59.94 Hz is to the NES's 60.1 Hz.
