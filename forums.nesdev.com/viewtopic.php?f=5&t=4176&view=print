<br />The game lacks sprite flickering and slowdowns, but aside of that it seems pretty close to what the game could have been on the NES. Also some things they do are possible but would require insane amount of CHRROM (water in BurstMan stage). Also I wouldn't be surprised if some scenes would require more than 256 tiles, more than 4 BG palettes, more than 4 sprite palettes or colors that doesn't exist in NES palette. I might be wrong tough.

<br />
<br />I pretty much agree completely. I hate when games have a lack of control change settings. I'm pretty sure you can only choose to have Z/X be shoot/jump. Oh, you can also choose to have different number of starting lives, and there's other things that you can change. On a side note, I would strongly recommend learning Katakana Japanese characters to everyone, because those almost always spell out English words. For instance, I found "sutaato", which is "start", or "raifu", which is "life". It's quite easy to learn, and it helps A LOT even if you know no other Japanese. There's like fifty or so letters, and they're really easy to spot out.

<br />Rozner Labs also made the PC version of Mega Man X. While far superior to their previous "efforts," it is still a rather crappy port.

<br />A lot of people call Rockman and Forte/Mega Man and Bass "Rockman 9/Mega Man 9", but Capcom didn't. If there ever were a Mega Man 9, it would probably involve the creation of X and Zero (and possibly the failed Square and Triangle projects) and the death of Light and Wily in preparation for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_X_%28video_game%29" class="postlink">the number after 9</a>.

<br />
<br />Are you sure the X in "Mega Man X" stands for 10 ? I've always wondered this, and found no definite answer. It seems X would rather be a subseries, as the protagonist is named himself "Mega Man X", which was obvously inspired by "Mega Man", but it's not the same robot. Also, if X would stand for 10, would this imply that Dr.Light would have created 8 other Mega Man before sucessfully build Mega Man X ?

<br />No, but it was suspicious that Capcom stopped on 8, just as it is suspicious that Apple hasn't gone to XI after seven years of Mac OS Ten (nine years if you count Mac OS X Server). I assume that the lack of a number on Rockman and Forte would indicate that Capcom was saving the 9 for something special, such as linking the two series somehow, just as Mac OS 9 linked the Classic era to the Carbon/Cocoa era.

<br />what about  Zero in MMX, Some people seem to think that he is the orginal Megaman after various upgrades turned him into what he is now. That would also imply there are 11 differint Megamen.
<br />
<br />A decent storyline that would go along with this logic is the 9 outher Megamen were captured and reprogrammed for evil and Zero..........
