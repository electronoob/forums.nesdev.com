		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have seen some people who make battery backed ram carts for mapper 0. Does someone have schematics? Or instructions? I don't want to have to build a whole copyNES. I have heard there is one that connects to a MIDI (joystick) port somewhere. I am a noobie, so please be nice and help me out. This is my second nes project hack and my first cartridge hack. Thanks in advance guys.

<br />
<br />The cart that connects to MIDI is Midines (<a href="http://www.wayfar.net/" class="postlink">http://www.wayfar.net/</a>), it uses a version of the board I designed for my Squeedo devcart (which I'll be releasing sometime, right now cable building is an issue and also firmware development with the PIC18F chip).
<br />
<br />It depends on what you want to do with this cart, do you want to rewrite it every week or every few minutes?  And do you want it to run mapper #0 games, or you want it to run your own code?
<br />
<br />I don't know what tools and chips and stuff you already have to work with.  There's several ways to make a devcart, the best way depends on what you want to do with it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a couple of eproms that seem to work just fine in my current mapper 0 cartridge, and I have a nice retired xeltec chip programmer that my dad brought me from where he works. That is fine, but what I don't have is a UV light to erase the chips with. I am looking for something which I can rewrite frquently, but not on a constant basis like some people using CopyNES want to do. I am mostly just messing with some basic stuff, and what I really want is to have a set of development carts for common mappers. But I need to start someplace simple. If SRAM is hard to do, is there possibly some sort of EEProm I could use? My programmer probably does not support flash at all.

<br />
<br />It'd be worth finding out, on xeltec's site.  If it can write SRAM, it should be able to write flashrom too (hardware-wise at least, I dunno about the firmware/software).  Look up chips like AMD 29F040, or Atmel ones like 29C256 and 29C040.
<br />
<br />There are SRAM chips you can get with the battery built-in.  Lots of ones made by Dallas, I can't remember the part #s though.  But they look expensive and physically huge (nothing's really gonna fit in an NES cart case with a socket though anyways).  I see them on ebay a lot but don't know if I'd recommend using those.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />ok, I found out I can write flash with my device and with my software. But I thought the NROM only let you use chips that were 128 or maybe 256 kb. Also, what chips would be directly compatible? I have heard of the 29F256 being directly compatible (no rewiring) , but I really don't know. I have 27C256 chips and those work without having to be rewired in the socket. I would like to keep my sockets without rewiring, if possible. Thanks, and wish me luck!

<br />I use AT29C256's (256 kbits = 32 kbytes) without any rewiring. I also got some W27E512 (these are not Flash, they are eletrically erasable) that work without rewiring, even though they are 512 kbits (64 kbytes).
<br />
<br />I believe there are two kinds of NROM boards, NROM-128 and NROM-256, and the 128 kind can not read 256kbit chips. Well, it probably CAN read, but not all of it.
