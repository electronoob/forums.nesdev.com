		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had worked on doing Bad Apple demo as well, but for PCE. The SNES shares a similar advantage, native 2bpp tile format. Less bandwidth to transfer. But since the pixel format is planar, the compression has to be tailored as such. My approach was to use was to use a number of binary tree sets, for the compression encoding. My target size was also smaller than both MD and SNES (2.5megabytes total).<br /><br /> Here's the idea I had:<br /><img src="http://www.pcedev.net/bad_apple/BA_frame.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /> I preprocessed all frames into 3 shades; black, grey, and white. While I had technically 4 shades to work with (2bpp), 3 colors compressed much better than 4. I also separate the image into two 1bpp images. The decoder follows a variable length operation system; binary encoded. Each frame is checked for statistics, to prioritize encoding to produce the smallest length for the highest occurring instance of that operation - per frame. I encode the picture into vertical 8pixel wide strips. A simple RLE system works for long runs of vertical rows. If the rows are tiles, RLE groups of tiles. If the tile only has few sets of RLE, then a bitmask+constant compression method is used (0=fetch literal, 1=use constant). The tile rows can also be further compressed if you represent rows of pixels are left or right shifts, of the proceeding rows. These would be padded shifts (similar to a (sec, rol/ror) or (clc,rol/ror) &lt;n&gt; number of times). This last part really helped bring the number down, per pic. There were other optimizations, where parts of the 3 color image that only used black or white, only needed 1bpp plane. So unless the specific tile had grey parts, it was 1bpp.<br /><br /> Another layer of compression sits on top; 1bit mask for all 8x8 tiles (0=reuse old tile, 1= build new tile). This helps keep the vram bandwidth down (and keep the cpu from building redundant tiles). And then finally, some sort of temporal tile/tilemap compression (for statics parts over frames).<br /><br /> Anyway, that's what I came up with. I never finished it though. I hadn't got to the audio compression side yet. I wanted to see what cpu resource was left over, before tackling that.

But I guess there is some already nice solutions existing for that in conventional codec. Glad i was able to use a lossless codec for my version.<br /><br />tomaitheous&gt; Any chance you get back to it ? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> The sound compression is not a big deal, it's really not significant compared to the video itself !

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had so much on my mind I forgot about this.  I got done with the tile map decompression, now I have to decompress the tiles themselves.  This frame takes up 120 tiles, and the tile map is compressed to 137 bytes.<br /><br />I realize that it is disappointing that I only have a single frame finished.  I just want to have a working compression format first before worrying about programming a video encoder.
