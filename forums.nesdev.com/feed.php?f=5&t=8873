Right, it seems like most games make a pass for each file they access since they can't buffer the whole side in memory. When they make you wait through two passes, flip, wait through a pass, flip back and wait through a final pass it's very aggravating. Games which load between scenery changes become infuriating when either dying or getting bumped off screen by an enemy triggers two sets of loading to get back to where you want to be (I think Dracula II is an offender). Also if you get a disk error you still have to wait for the pass to complete and sometimes wait through a second pass where the read is reattempted. Great games, miserable loading.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Fri May 11, 2012 12:47 am</p><hr />

You mean if file loading was optimized enough so that it would only take one pass?, which i suppose if you were basically loading DRAM with a cartridge image from FDS disk it wouldn't have been so bad. So 16 seconds plus disk flipping time to load up a 1 meg game like Mega Man or Ghosts and Goblins and still less than a minute for a 2 Meg game like Double Dragon, that actually doesn't sound that bad. But piracy is still an issue for magnetic disks. <br /><br />I guess that isn't surprising that disk loading times were not really optimized.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Thu May 10, 2012 11:01 pm</p><hr />

Besides ROM memory falling in price dramatically and battery backed RAM on carts, another key problem with the FDS was Nintendo's strict licensing. If I recall, Nintendo got a partial copyright for any FDS games released. The profit margins may have been lower, etc. From a business perspective for developers it was a bad deal. <br /><br />So it was both business and the aging FDS versus the better cheaper technology for carts. The FDS could have been upgraded with a new RAZM adapter, but that wouldn't have solved the piracy or loading issues. Later NES games were very commonly 128K, 256K, and 512K. FDS disks hold around 128K using both sides and I think it takes over a minute to scan the whole disk. So it would take considerable time before getting to play later games if you went that route.<br /><br />And ROM was probably cheaper than a large initial investment in DRAM for a disk type system for later games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Thu May 10, 2012 9:18 pm</p><hr />

Also, the ability in saving games when battery backed RAM could be added to cartridges. The FDS had lost its advantages by then. Also, you didn't need to swap disks and wait impatiently for the loadings with games on cartridges.<br /><br />I don't think being able to bypass the license message screen is any large security breach either as it's just for the licensing and not copy protection. Besides the advantages of cartridges over disks mentioned above, the main problem was pirating. Even consumers could copy the disks easily themselves provided they have the appropriate software. Nintendo did try to counter this by making revisions to the unit, such as limiting the size of data it could write in one go, but still, most units were just modded to circumvent this (I'm not sure but I've heard that the last revision could not be (easily) modded). The irony was that not only FDS games were pirated, but the drives were used alongside game copiers such as Game Doctors and Game Converters in pirating <em>cartridge</em> games (that's why the FDS was extremely popular here, possibly even more popular than in Japan).<br /><br />Another problem was, Nintendo tried to profit from selling the bulk disks, but people quickly realised that they could convert Quickdisks for use with the FDS and later bulk disks were even manufactured cheaply in factories (and the NINTENDO indent on the disks was just a joke as protect measures). Since the FDS didn't generate much profit (FDS games were meant to be sold at prices much lower than carts and some developers were not willing to develop FDS games; the pirating of the games just didn't help) there is no wonder Nintendo eventually gave up on it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4653">Gilbert</a> — Wed May 09, 2012 7:25 pm</p><hr />

On top of that the FDS didn't last all that long. And died off way before the 16 bit systems. (You could stil get disks from nintendo til about 2003 though, but I'm talking about mainstream popularity from a dev perspective here)<br />Reason for this is that the cost of rom and ic's went down alot in following years and it became more reasonable to make a cartridge with bigger rom.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3369">Jeroen</a> — Wed May 09, 2012 1:06 pm</p><hr />

I'd argue its stil a "major" security breach. Just for a different purpose than what would typically be considerd usefull. Obviously Nintendo put that file there as a way to control who can get licensing (as mentioned this was before SEGA vs thingie) This method bypasses that and gets around it.<br /><br />Back in the day this could've been pretty major.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3369">Jeroen</a> — Mon May 07, 2012 3:17 pm</p><hr />
