That's the thing about programming, if you try to rush through it, you're bound to get stuck later on.

Most of the original Doom rendering code is x86 assember.<br /><br />Also, the SNES port was programmed by Randy Linden of Sculptured Software using their own SFX2+ development system. IIRC there was some C support in their dev kit, but again, using C for the rendering code (or anything in game, really) and get the performance of the SNES Doom port is quite unthinkable.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">ARM9 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Wikibooks wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">An open source compiler is rumored to be in development as of January 2015 to compile SuperFX programs.</div><br />Compiler, or assembler?
