		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />How to print Wikipedia articles that have math notations so article is clearly readable? I noticed a while back that Wikipedia must have changed its interface. Now, I can't print clearly any article with math notations. The equations and other math symbols get completely distorted in a slanted fashion. The article becomes so unclear as to be unreadable. If you want to learn about math, but you can't clearly read the formulas you are stuck.

<br />Should the moderators begin Googling everything that comes across the board?  Maybe I should Google "I greatly dislike this board's approach to spam......"?  Heh.  :-)  Besides, there's a nesdev forum spam quote that a bunch of us on IRC have an alias for because it's so funny:
<br />
<br />"8D Thats the way it is done do you not think so."
<br />
<br />I don't know what else you expect.  Most of the spam that comes across here now **is not** automated.  It's a manual process involving human beings who are hired in foreign (cheap) countries like India to create accounts, post, etc...  We block their netblocks as they appear on the forum, but these businesses have a lot of netblocks all over the place.
<br />
<br />By the way, things go on in the Moderators forum here semi-often.  tepples and I tend to be fairly quick about catching spammers/abusers.  In fact just recently I had to firewall off a portion of China.  *shrug*

If I could I would even remove the history but I don't know any option to do it yet.  It may be drastic but we're a small community and I try to keep the content clean.
<br />
<br />When I saw this message yesterday, it was pretty obvious: ask about print math thing of media wiki <strong>inside nes music</strong>.
<br />
<br />Why would someone post on the nesdev forum, a very niche place about that <strong>on his first mail</strong>? The person is not a regular yet. That's pretty obvious it's a bot.
<br />
<br />Then yesterday during the night you have that human spammer that wrote messages were the content value was similar to "yeah, I understand what you mean" with that Philippine call center link.  Why the mails were not removed? Why only the links? The mails had no value and that person will never come back again, it's quite obvious.
<br />
<br />If people are affraid to remove those mail or ban people because maybe, someday, that person will do some good then "let me be your spam moderator tyrant".  Then when there will be a false positive you can blame me <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />
<br />For the history removal, I found that new version of media wiki contain an option called "DeleteRevision".  I activated it and was able to remove to the public the spammed content.
<br />
<br />Now if I could find an option that only a certain group of users can add external links.. we could remove that annoying captcha. Keep on searching..

<br />For the PageRank boost. That's why I neutralized the links in the first post, so that the spammer doesn't get any PageRank from nesdev.com.

<br />
<br />Likewise I fail to see how anyone can gain anything out of mass distribution of spam mail (electronic or unsolicited snail mail ads).  But here's the kicker: people DO occasionally read the mails + click the links and buy something.  I realise it's difficult to understand/accept -- but you have to remember that the majority of the Internet and people don't think like engineers/technical folks.
<br />
<br />Let's say a company in India is creating accounts on their own behalf -- the goal being to create accounts manually (to get past captchas, etc.) and then turn around and sell those account credentials (login/pass) to a highest bidder (usually a spammer).  The winner then goes and uses the account to post spam URLs, etc. -- which someone will eventually accidentally or intentionally click.
<br />
<br />The biggest problem I have with this whole "business" is that it's a combination of sleaze and laziness.  It's a lot more effective and rewarding (personally and economically) to get an actual job working for someone doing something.  For example, Parodius is a hobby of mine -- I spend quite a bit of money (US$600/month, soon to be $700) to keep it up and running -- but I have a day (night) job that provides me with income to pay for it.  I work, therefore I get paid.  Instead, these other dudes think "How can I make money off this, have it pay for itself, and allow me to stop working for the man?" which is how/when they start turning to shady/sleazy business tactics.
<br />
<br />Capitalism is a fricking addiction, I swear.  It's like somehow making money or involving oneself with money means turning off one's morals.  *sigh*

<br />Sure, but any random people would quickly notice that it's ridiculous it wins at lottery 100 times a day without playing any lottery.
