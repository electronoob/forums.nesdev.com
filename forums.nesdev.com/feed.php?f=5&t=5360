- Wal Mart has the lowest price for a new Wii in his online shop. Man, I won't be able to buy a Wii for now... my credit card is kinda "full" and... I'd like to wait for the upcoming releases, like New SMB Wii, Mario Galaxy2 and Metroid M. ^_^;; Gold stuff!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=39">Zepper</a> — Wed Jul 01, 2009 5:32 pm</p><hr />

Doesn't team Twiizers have a key to unbrick the Wii?<br /><br />If I can get the mechanisms all worked out I'll have two Wii's.<br />One for modding and one for Playing Wii titles that I don't have to worry about updates with.<br /><br />I really Liked the Wii homebrew. Had some pretty decent emulators and software.<br /><br /><br />Hmm, I just remembered I had an extended warranty w/ wal-mart. I should get it back together and try to return it. The warranty seals seem pretty easy to reproduce. But if I do that I'll get me an updated Wii. Although that crappy Mad world game updated the IOS anyway. So crap.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3722">ironfist61</a> — Wed Jul 01, 2009 3:25 pm</p><hr />

I disassembled my Wii yesterday.<br />Couldn't get the damn thing back together. This is one compact system.<br />I bought a new Wii today but, does anyone have a link to some teardown guides? This has got to be the most complex assembly I have ever torn down. <br /><br />Also, more damage before that was caused by the update that poisoned 'Mad World'. Which rendered  most of my games. (At least the Sega ones) unplayable.<br />So I guess it's semi bricked.<br /><br />If I do manage to repair the thing, I guess I'll keep one for homebrew and the other as a Wii. That oughta work.  <br /><br />Edit: maybe this post should be a blog but, It contained questions I need answered so I'll post it here. Capieche?<br />I hope that's okay.<br /><br />Edit2: Anyway. I also would like to mention I got it together somewhat. But for some reason the disc drive doesn't work. Maybe I put the power it backwards? @.@. I really hate the optical drive. <br /><br />Another thing I'm curious about. Why does the Wii have so little memory? (yeah I don't like to say RAM these days when it's not random but is Burst. [Why not BAM?] LOL.  ) And why does it seem that many product use Samsung memory? (The Wii, Acer, Microsoft Xbox 360) Is that 'cause it's more affordable?<br />Now I'll just shut my fingers and quit rambling. Sorry.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3722">ironfist61</a> — Wed Jul 01, 2009 2:41 pm</p><hr />
