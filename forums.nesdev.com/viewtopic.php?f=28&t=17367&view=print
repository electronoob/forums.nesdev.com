		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It depends on how it's hooked up.  You can use HC outputs on LS inputs, but not LS outputs on HC inputs.  For that situation there is the HCT family, those are HC parts with TTL-level inputs.  This site has a pretty good chart of the voltage levels.<br /><a href="http://www.interfacebus.com/voltage_threshold.html" class="postlink">http://www.interfacebus.com/voltage_threshold.html</a>

The former can scale arbitrarily—each extra latch doubles the number of states—but it's asynchronous: each latch adds more propagation time through the entire stack. The twisted-ring counter only adds two new states per extra latch, but is synchronous: all bits change (or fail to change) at the same time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Er.... not really? M2 could be used as a DRAM refresh clock, but it would only hold its value while it's running. When reset is held, the clock stops, and the contents of the single bit of DRAM will be lost.<br /><br />The circuit you linked to is an S-R latch, not a JK register. On its own, it can't do a useful thing in response to a clock input, so the reset-detection circuit isn't related.<br /><br />Regardless, it's still so many passives that I can't imagine it's cheaper than something more nearly integrated.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Are there any parts other than discretes that are affordable?<br /><br />A lot of TTL 74xxx parts have the schematic of how they're made available as part of the datasheet. For example, I've attached a schematic from TI's datasheet for the SN74LS74A-<div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
			<a href="./download/file.php?id=12667&amp;mode=view"><img src="./download/file.php?id=12667&amp;t=1" alt="74ls74a-002.png" /></a><br />
			<span class="gensmall">74ls74a-002.png [ 24.52 KiB | Viewed 974 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div>You could eliminate approximately half of the transistors here in order to convert this into a &quot;T-type flip-flop&quot;, but it's still a huge number.<br /><br />But it doesn't take very much complexity before the datasheets stop showing the schematic and instead just show a logic diagram:<div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
			<img src="./download/file.php?id=12670" alt="SN7470--000.png" /><br />
			<span class="gensmall">SN7470--000.png [ 9.07 KiB | Viewed 974 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div>. While it's certainly easy enough to convert a symbol back to a bunch of transistors, it doesn't speak well for the hope of manageable size.
