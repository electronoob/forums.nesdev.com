<br />
<br />Saying the NES can't display yellow can be defended by blaming it on his tv-card (or whatever he claims to use as capture device). In fact, any shot at disproving those images/sounds can easily be defended, up to telling his DVD ROM attachment includes special graphics and sound chips to enhance those of the NES. Asking for the source code of Sonic 2 NES can be backed by telling his special compiler is generating the code for him. Asking for source code of that compiler might corner him, causing him to get upset, angry, and threatening to leave the forums. Or who knows, he might just say his harddisk suddenly crashed.
<br />
<br />In short, it's of no use trying to disprove it, other than making part of the people that believe him have doubts. It'll be enjoyable for him trying to come up with excuses.

<br />Hard to tell which is worse. I'm personally offended by this, since I'm actually coding a Sonic engine. I'm busting my ass out to recreate the engine in a way that is as fast and enjoyable as the original series, and then comes this guy and says he's "ported" it. As if it were possible...
<br />
<br />Therer are so many inconsistencies... The same graphical glitch as the Mega Drive version, the sprite count in a scanline, the yellow, the frame skipping (as if a console would "skip frames" like an emulator, as opposed to playing it all, but slowly)...
<br />
<br />They actually believe the game can simply be "ported", in spite of the machines being so different. There is no way for the code of the Mega Drive game to work, even if translated to the NES, because that exact engine will just not work. The way the level are handled, the memory requirements, difference in GFX hardware (he doesn't seem to know that there are much more particularities than the ammount of colors)...
<br />
<br />I'll post a little something there, if the moderator ever accepts me.

<br />But maybe the Famicom can. Remember that the Famicom uses NTSC-J, which warps hues to make flesh tones look "better". Also remember that the European NES uses a PAL PPU, whose hues are offset by 15 degrees from the NTSC PPU's nominal colors. Even on NTSC-M, watch for "comb filter" excuses if the code is toggling the colors from frame to frame to make them look more yellow.
<br />
<br />But those images still appear hoaxish, as the Sonic sprite has way too many colors even for the Mega Man trick (flesh tones in a separate sprite). It looks more like Sega Master System graphics if anything. If the score ever goes greater than 999, that would look hoaxish too for exceeding the limit of 8 sprite slivers per line. And what's the 224-line picture doing in a 240-line PPU? And where's the 3-line color burst alternation?
<br />
<br />Excuses about a DVD-ROM drive are inexcusable once the NES Power Pak comes out. CompactFlash and ATAPI are electrically identical.
<br />
<br />And I could make better music than that in NT2, even without DPCM.

<br />I understand this pretty much. This should be a bit frustrating. I and Celius are also getting our ass attempting to remake another recent Final Fantasy game, and even the basics are a pain in the ass to do.
<br />
<br />I'd recommend everyone to log on in the forum and start to ask lots of questions that the guy won't be able to answer to trash him down and make him pay for his impudence (like we already did for FFX before). I don't know much about sonic and so, so I don't feel too much like starting.
<br />
<br />PS : The backgrounds definitely looks pretty much NES-ish, however the sprites are so obviously not NES-ish at all.

<br />Yeah, this is a very good idea. Better than showing up and saying that the whole thing is a bunch of crap. We could indentify ourselves as NES programmers, and ask many technical questions on how he achieved some of the effects, and I'm sure he won't be able to answer. Sounds like something tepples would do! =)

<br />I'm waiting for my registration to be validated. It's taking a lot of time though.
