		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When I installed NESICIDE's dependencies and then NESICIDE, I got errors about DLLs.<br />First missing DLL was sdl.dll. I got it from a DLL downloading website.<br />Then I was bothered by mingwm10.dll, libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll, QtCore4.dll, QtGui4.dll.<br /><br />Now as I got the DLLs, I got this big error:<br />&quot;The procedure entry point _Z21qRegisterResourceDataiPKhS0_S0_ could not be located in the dynamic link library QtCore4.dll&quot;.<br />I've been trying to solve this by using different DLLs, but they'd give another error about another procedure entry point (I'm not going to search which DLL caused that because this is a pain in the!).<br /><br />So which DLLs am I supposed to download?<br />Can someone upload working DLLs from NESICIDE for me to Dropbox? (Please please please please don't use the upload services with virusy ads and offers or sites that will give me a blank screen or say &quot;I am error&quot;)

There is no way to insure getting the correct one from such a site.<br /><br />To get the correct versions of DLLs for NESICIDE, ask the author. The lack of included DLLs is something that needs to be solved by the person who made the software, not something you should attempt to cobble together on your own with incomplete information about what you need. Omission of needed DLLs from the NESICIDE package would have been a mistake and needs to be corrected by its author.

Instead, it would use the HTTP client in Windows to download the secondary installer for the dependencies from the Internet, run that installer, and then continue. It's like how the Java installer downloads the Ask toolbar, except not evil.

But it installs wherever you tell it to install to. If you tell it to install to F:, it'll put everything on F:. That is what *I* mean by &quot;portable install&quot;. Ie. &quot;I've installed this on something that I can put in my pocket...&quot;<br /><br />I'm not sure I understand all this &quot;I hate non-portable installers...&quot; An installer's an installer. If you don't want the software installed, don't install it. Hate something else...something worth hating...?
