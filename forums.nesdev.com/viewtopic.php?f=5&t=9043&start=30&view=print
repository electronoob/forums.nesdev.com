<br />
<br />The sprite CHR patterns to be displayed on the next scanline get fetched during the first half of the hblank period, and there's just not enough cycles in the second half to turn rendering off, write $2006, write $2007, then restore scrolling with $2006 and possible $2005 and finally turn rendering back on again. So you'll end up with corrupted CHR graphics for your sprites...

<br />Anyway, Dithering can't be used for background color, color0(the"invisible" color, at $3F00), can it?

<br />That looks really good!

<br />So backgrounds near the bottom use one set of palettes, and the sky color shares colors with that, then backgrounds near the middle of the screen use another set of colors, and the sky colors are shared with that, then different colors at the top of the screen.

<br />
<br />And sorry about that off top. Back to games that push limits.
<br />I actually played BattleToads(never bothered to do so before) and I'm amazed by the level where you fly on plane(Level7).
<br />The mapper is AOROM.It has no IRQ. So how did they make <a href="http://youtu.be/qMuCefynmtA?t=1m56s" class="postlink">this effect</a>?
<br />I mean those violet flames at the top of the screen.
<br />The only way that comes to my mind is to wait for the end of status bar code, then time the code carefully so it'll wait for Hblank, change Horizontal scrolling on every scanline. But that's....insanely hard to do. For me, at least.

<br />
<br />In the Turbo Tunnel, they use a sprite 0 hit that happens after the top part is done scrolling.  Then they use a simplified screen renderer if it's playing PCM samples (game paused, etc.)

<br />I doubt it. Battletoads uses the sprite zero hit in the status bar, for the separation between the status bar and the playfield. The sound driver is called after the VBlank (which is constant timed) ends and the screen is enabled (late, after the extended VBlank). The sound driver is variable-timed, so they need the sprite zero hit in the status bar to split to the playfield accuracely.
<br />
<br />I guess all other effects mentioned is simply timed code after this split. This reduces CPU usage for the game, of course. Apparently they managed it to be fast enough, even when most of the screen is taken by raster effects, which means the game engine is very fast and efficient. When playing a sound effect via $4011, they ignore this part apparently, which causes weird scrolling glitches when you punch enemies.
<br />
<br />In Battletoads &amp; DoubleDragon, they did it the other way around, the timed code continues to run, but the PCM sound effects are distorted when there is a raster effect on the screen.

<br />
<br />In other levels, sprite 0 is indeed inside the status bar.  But not the Turbo Tunnel.

<br />I must admit that's a little crazy, but after all why not ?

<br />Also the status bar is lower (and the extended VBlank bigger) for the Snake Pit and the Cylindrical Level in the NTSC version. There is still no extended VBlank in the PAL version though.
