<br />Yeah, but real life is in first-person 3D, while the games we're talking about are displayed in 2D from the side, I don't think the same rules apply.
<br />
<br />A side-view 2D game is much more similar to a camera man trying to keep track of a person. There is a certain amount of prediction when the movement gets faster, but ideally the subject is centered most of the time.

<br />I.e. split the screen when the two players get too far from each other. That would work, and would be kind of cool, but would probably limit the visibility too much for a platformer.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just use the window method. There's a column of about 32 pixels in the center of the screen in which the player can freely maneuver without the camera moving. As soon as they go beyond the edge of the area, provided the camera isn't locked in place for a certain event, the camera will only move so that the player is not outside of the edge. The player won't be centered or anything like that. It works quite nicely, as the window in the middle of the screen is really small and you don't notice that you're not exactly centered. I feel like if you were exactly centered at all times, the camera would be jerky and it would be hard to make sense of what's going on when you switch directions or make subtle movements when things are flying at you.

<br />
<br />Here's how my game handles that. (Though it hasn't been stress tested, since I only have the physics for the main characters done. No enemies, and no pit deaths are possible.)
<br />
<br />I've already said I just use the average of their positions for the camera. I likely will not ever change this for multiple players, even if I add a window in single player. 
<br />
<br />If the players are slightly less than a screen away from each other horizontally, they can't progress further away from the other character horizontally. 
<br />
<br />If the players are slightly less than a screen away vertically:
<br />It decides whether the player is higher or lower than the other player.
<br />
<br />If the player is higher and airborne, it sets the airborne player's gravity to max speed.
<br />
<br />If the player is higher and grounded, it does nothing.
<br />
<br />If the player is lower and airborne, it does nothing if the other player is airborne. (I may 0 out the low player's velocity since it's a little safer to have the scroll slightly ahead of the lowest player)
<br />
<br />If the player is lower and airborne, and the other player is grounded, it moves the lower player to the position and speeds of the other player and takes away some health. ( I may do a bubble thing instead of instantly setting the position, because this is likely a terrible idea for fast paced levels)
<br />
<br />This solves a lot of problems. It's fairly difficult (but not completely impossible) for a player to "save" one who's falling into a pit from dying. If the pit is deep enough, it might allow them to not die but just lose some health. I accept this, I really can't do better with how my game deals with collision.

<br />Why not just have some special tiles at the top of the pit, which when touched would immediately set a flag indicating that the player should die no matter what. In any case it's not a big deal, it can be considered a game play element. People like exploiting stuff like that.

<br />Yeah, Skull &amp; Crossbones (Unl) is another game that does split screen. It'd be a cool feature to have, but probably not worth all the extra effort, for me at least.

<br />One problem with four-way split-screen scrolling on the NES is that you'd need to have two independent scrolling windows, which means single-screen mirroring. There are only two common boards that support that: A*ROM (#7) and S*ROM (#1). T*SROM and E*ROM also support it but are much less common, though rewiring any T*ROM to act as T*SROM is about as simple as rewiring it to take EPROM.
