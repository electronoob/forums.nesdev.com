One of my sister's friends gave us an XBox 360 today. Guess where I went on its Internet Explorer browser first? <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 50%; line-height: normal">(It was my screenshots gallery.)</span> I must say, I'm not <em>certain</em> whether it's the XBox 360's Composite Out or the colors in my palette, but — most of the hues looked a bit off, and the colors <em>all</em> looked <em>massively</em> over-saturated.<br /><br />$x3 and $x4 looked like they'd been tint-shifted 50% to 75% toward $x4 and $x5 (respectively); $x9 looked a bit less limey than it does on the actual console, and $28 (and partially $18; possibly also $38) looked too orangey. $xC was too bright, and too cyan; it needed more blue. (I was doing a back-and-forth comparison between the XBox 360's screen and the colors on the actual NES itself; they're both hooked up to the TV simultaneously.)<br /><br /><em>But,</em> as far as $x3 and $x4 are concerned, at least: the NEStopia YUV (15º Canonical) master palette's colors were much closer to the actual thing. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> $x9 was still too far to the 'blue' side of the spectrum, though; it needed more yellow. (The NEStopia YUV (Alternate) palette, on the other hand, looked more like a NES-on-a-Chip console: it had <em>too much</em> yellow, due to the 'Yellow Boost' being turned on.) $xC looked about the same as in my palette.<br /><br />Granted, I've not hooked an actual PC up to the TV yet to look at my Definitive NES master palette on that screen 'side-by-side' with the NES's output — so I don't know if it really <em>is</em> the XBox 360 screwing up all of the colors — but at the moment I'm not inclined to try and 'perfect' my NES master palette for (my) CRT television(s). :p I'd made it for <em>computers</em> anyway, and it looks good enough on them — at least, to me. So it serves the purpose it was intended for. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><br /><br />I'll be doing up my screenshots in about a week or so using the Wii Virtual Console palette that someone 'dumped', just to see how <em>it</em> looks on my TV via the XBox 360's palette; this has got me really curious now. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">LightStruk wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle">Kizul Emeraldfire wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> But I'm not really willing to go to quite that much bother to improve this palette; in my opinion, it's already as close to 'perfect' as one can get. :p …At least, for an NTSC palette.<br /></div>Nor should you.

But, the colors on my laptop's LCD screen do seem more muted/dull in some ways compared to my PC's two CRT monitors; on the other hand, I can see color separation far more easily on my laptop's screen — probably due to the pixels being much clearer — than on my PC's CRTs, so… <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><br /><br />But yeah, I know what you mean. I still think that the colors look 'better', somehow, on my PC than on my laptop.

Unfortunately, the Gaussian Blur filter caused slight color loss as well in some screenshots: I discovered that the more times you blur with it at maximum strength, the closer it goes to #808080 gray. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /><br /><br />So… I dunno. Maybe my NES is just slightly oddball; maybe it doesn't adhere 100% to the NTSC color standards of 1950s or 1980s U.S.A./Japan. &gt;.&gt; I think the colors fluctuate between various NES Control Decks anyway, given <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=yvZEC5-lEOA#t=737" class="postlink">what I saw at Awesome Games Done Quick once</a>.

Or like the Wii's NES Virtual Console. It's also a little blurrier than the others, so possibly it's using RF instead of Composite? I dunno. ¯\(º_O)/¯)<br /><br />If I knew someone (who lived in the same town as me) who owned an oscilloscope or something, I might be able to get the palette even more accurate — maybe.

The RGB primaries and white point both changed with the 1987 standard!<br /><br />Super Mario Bros. and Zelda 2 both predate the 1987 standard. Japan used NTSC, just like North America. When the designers were making them, they would be using TVs designed and built before the 1987 standard.

I don't think humans really have much ability to remember absolute colours with any kind of precision.<br /><br />There's no way you could remember the exact hue of the SMB sky without having thought a lot about it and made direct comparisons with other potentials, etc., which is what you might be doing now that you're looking at palette possibilities. You need a framework of reference to be able to recall colours that way.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Wed Dec 30, 2015 1:30 pm</p><hr />

Something that has always seemed weird to me for as long as I've used NES emulators - was the sky in SMB1 and Zelda 2 <em>really</em> this purple? <br /><br />smb1title.png<br /><br />zelda2ruto.png<br /><br />I no longer have a real NES console or a CRT TV, so I can't check for myself. Assuming that this palette matches the behavior of correctly calibrated 1980s TVs, it strikes me as very strange that Nintendo chose such a purple hue ($22, I think) when $21 or $31 would look much better.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5978">LightStruk</a> — Wed Dec 30, 2015 1:00 pm</p><hr />

Maniac Mansion is one game I've actually never played, so I didn't know about this. ò.O<br /><br />I guess I could make one for Bee 52, and then change my main 'Definitive' one to have a $1D that's the same color as $xE/$xF.<br /><br />Thank you for letting me know! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> I'll roll that change out between twelve and eighteen hours from now<span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">*</span>, probably. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />And in screenshot gallery-related news, I was able to get NESten, FWNES, and loopynes all working on my Windows 98 PC, and so now they have pages up on <a href="http://nekomimi.cx/~kizul/nes_files/screenshot_gallery/" class="postlink">the screenshot gallery</a> as of a few minutes ago. (Sadly FWNES, loopynes, BioNES, and FCEUX all look nearly identical to each other. xD)<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">Unfortunately, I <em>did</em> end up having to use DOSBox to get a screenshot of loopynes running rainwarrior's palette.nes, because while I managed to get it to run — I was correct that it didn't seem to have a screenshot-saving option. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /></span><br /><br />Ah well! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> Now all I have left to add are just the Nintendo VC palettes, the Nestopia YUV &quot;Consumer&quot; palette, and maybe the palette of &quot;REW&quot;, an interesting emulator that played Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and NES games. And possibly JNES in there somewhere.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">*<strong>EDIT:</strong></span> <a href="http://nekomimi.cx/~kizul/nes_files/Kizuls_Definitive_NES_Palette.zip" class="postlink">aaaaaaand that's done now</a>. I decided instead to make a separate palette for Maniac Mansion; it was simpler to create a single palette that would work better for (primarily) one single game. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /><br /><br />I may look around my local used-games shops and see if I can get my hands on a copy of Maniac Mansion and rent it to see how it looks on my Control Deck; I'm curious how the blacks look on the real hardware. ò.O<br /><br />Meanwhile, I may <em>also</em> end up rooting through almost the entire NES ROM set to see how games use which blacks and where; just in the few I was testing of the games I already own, I noticed that Dragon Warrior uses $0D for the mouths of Red Slimes, and $0E for the dragon silhouette on the title screen (as well as monster shadows). Meanwhile, Dragon Warrior III (and most other NES games, it would seem) uses just $0F for black, whilst Dragon Warrior <em>IV</em> uses $0F for black — except during battles, where it uses $<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>F. (Lunar Pool also uses $3F for its main black, but the glowing Cue Ball flashes to $0E when it turns black.)<br /><br />This is <em>maddening.</em> <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /> But hey, at least some of us can agree: my palette looks a dang sight better than many <em>other</em> palettes out there! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> (Maybe not <em>all</em> of them, but <em>a lot</em> of them… <span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">In <em>my</em> opinion, at least…</span>) It would seem that about the only <em>major</em> problems my palette has lie in (some of) the blacks! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></span> And, of course, because accidentally creating dead links all the time isn't enough, I ended up accidentally getting the two palettes switched around, so the special Maniac Mansion palette was <em>still broken</em> (technically). <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /> I just fixed it, though. &gt;.&gt;<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><strong>EDIT 3:</strong></span> after much deliberation (and going through nearly the entire library of NTSC-U NES ROMs), I've decided to instead have a special palette for Bee 52, and rename the one that I'd made for Maniac Mansion so that the <em>Maniac Mansion-specific</em> palette is now the 'default' palette (and I've retroactively uploaded the Zip file into my older post). Apologies for the headaches, everyone. This will be my final edit, both to this post, and to this palette. :p<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=100">Kizul Emeraldfire</a> — Sun Dec 27, 2015 5:57 pm</p><hr />
