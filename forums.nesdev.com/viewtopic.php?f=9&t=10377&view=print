I checked the other mappers and couldn't find the combination of both CHR RAM and PRG RAM I was looking for, in a discrete mapper like NROM - I don't get why that seems to support PRG RAM and not the bankswitched discrete mappers.<br /><br />So I was wondering if anyone knew of a discrete mapper supported by ReproPak that has both CHR and PRG RAM.<br /><br />I say discrete so it could be manufactured by hand.<br /><br />Sorry if this post is retarded - I'm more of a software guy.

The <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PRG_RAM_circuit" class="postlink">wiki</a> lists out most of the options you've got for a discrete mapper anyways.<br /><br />Although you'd have to hack a repro-pak quite a bit to get that circuit and prg-ram on there...<br /><br />One possible option is to use battery backed SRAM as PRG-ROM.  You'd have to sacrafice some rom space for ram use, and be sure not to ever write to rom space.  If 32KB of combined PRG-ROM and RAM was enough then you could do it.  But for a game small enough to fit on NROM, I'd argue 2KB is enough RAM especially if you have CHR-RAM as well.

Decompress a large horizontally scrolling map (8-screen wide maximum) in one go and use 16-bit coordinates for objects.  It will have lots of advantages besides just making things easier to code though like objects being able to navigate and interact with the map + any changes the player has made to it without having to be onscreen.

Might as well make it stage-based.</div><br /><br />Well that's the point, I want to be able to see how I can maximize a large decompressed map and do beyond what 2K permits.   BTW the game idea is a top-down open world adventure with a focus on lush complex scenery (see my post in Homebrew with WIP screenshots).<br /><br />Not to mention it will be easier and quicker to code.   I'm using a lot of proprietary bytecode to code the game much more rapidly than doing it all in plain 6502 would be.  Therefore it will be better to decompress each map while PPU is off rather than trying to make it work as you scroll.  It will just be too slow to keep a smooth framerate.<br /><br />Kinda surprised the focus is on &quot;waste&quot; rather than advantages.  Besides I'd only be using 12x16x8 of it (1536)  I would like to have as much RAM as possible for other uses.  Like decompression buffers for other data, like tables.  Self-modifying code.  You could say just as easily that the address space $6000-$7fff would be wasted without the RAM! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

If you really don't have much intent on building carts yourself there isn't much benefit to discrete mapper's limitations especially if you're really looking for PRG-RAM.  Don't expect emulators to provide PRG-RAM support on discrete mappers.  Designing your game for one of these mappers will give you the most flexibility and achieve your goals.

So that you'll never need to have more than one row or column of the map in memory. Of course it'll be slower but you can't have them all.

But MMC1 has a much bigger switch penalty than, say, UNROM, and bank switching in the NMI handler is more problematic because it's not atomic.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Don't expect emulators to provide PRG-RAM support on discrete mappers.</div><br />It worked for Family BASIC, and the NES 2.0 spec appears to require it. However, &quot;don't expect any old random emulator to support NES 2.0&quot; is a valid concern.

I think no extra work is needed from you, although adding error detection (&quot;do I have RAM?&quot;) and a message would be clever. NES 2.0 headers have the advantage that they make what you want exactly clear, rather than relying on heuristics. (And, they're backwards compatible, so the only badness to including NES 2.0 headers is &quot;someone won't understand and treat it as though they don't exist&quot;)<br /><br />There's no need to use precisely zzo38's MMC5 subset; you could start with <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/User:Lidnariq/MMC3_Variants" class="postlink">any other ASIC</a> and pick some trivial subset. (Obvious choices for &quot;UNROM banking, PRG RAM, CHR RAM&quot; are VRC3 (m73) and BA-JUMP2 (m153))<br /><br />Also, 8KiB CHR-RAM is a trivial exchange for 8 KiB CHR-ROM in all contexts.
