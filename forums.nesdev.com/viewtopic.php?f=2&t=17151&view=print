		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You can verify that your ROM isn't writing the NINA registers with a breakpoint.<br /><br />I would also recommend putting a read/write breakpoint on all regions where memory access is unexpected. (e.g. $0800-1FFF, $2008-$3FFF, $4020-$7FFF)<br /><br />The behaviour of FCEUX for the &quot;open bus&quot; regions where nothing is connected is especially different from a real NES (though Nintendulator gets this stuff correct). A well behaved program wouldn't be reading or writing there, though, under normal circumstances.<br /><br />A lot of emulators will stick WRAM at $6000-7FFF at nearly all times, which can also mess with this area that's supposed to be open bus. Similarly flash carts might do something that modifies this behaviour as well.<br /><br />Oh, and put FCEUX on &quot;New PPU&quot; mode if you haven't. This is much more accurate PPU behaviour.

I haven't spent any time debugging or testing further, but just thought it would be worth noting.
