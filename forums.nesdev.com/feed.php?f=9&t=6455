So today I got a modded NES 101 from akaviolence, but it doesn't work. I contacted him an hour ago, but so far no reply. <br /><br />Maybe you guys can help me out. <br /><br />I'm using an NES 001 power supply. This system has been modded with AV, stereo (either amplified mono or simulated stereo by dividing the sound channels) and has an overclock crystal installed. The pot for the stereo/mono mix is where the RF input was and the clock speed switch is where the channel 3-4 was. <br /><br /><br />When I turn the system on, I get a black screen with very very faint gray outline of what should appear on the far right of the screen. Additionally, audio is extremely distorted and garbled. The problem occurs at either clockspeed or stereo setting. <br /><br />When the composite yellow video plug is not inserted into the system, the system won't output sound, meaning the video line carries at least part of the audio signal. Not sure if this significant or by design.<br /><br />I only have a vague knowledge of the NES 2 and this modded system is the first I've ever owned. Nevertheless I have the means to take out the security screws and take some high res pictures of the PCB. <br /><br />Maybe doing so will allow you guys to understand what is wrong and address some earlier questions in this thread about just how akaviolence does this remarkable mod. <br /><br />Even though I payed for a system that arrives not working, I don't think that it's his fault. Probably just something came loose during shipping, or so I hope. <br /><br />So anyway, anyone have any theories for what could be the problem? I'm not just getting a bad picture, I'm getting almost no picture and extremely distorted audio, like what would happen if you crossed the audio and video jacks on an NES toaster. That high pitched whine. <br /><br /><br />I'll take some pics if it helps. What should I take pics of specifically?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4236">SatoshiMatrix</a> — Mon Nov 29, 2010 4:08 pm</p><hr />

I remember hearing that the top loader is missing the 21.47727 MHz cart connector pin? Can anybody confirm that?<br /><br />E: Okay, so it's like that in top loader and Famicom.

One other snag about the tint bits is that they aren't even synchronous; they can change <em>between</em> pixels (yes, this means the NES really has more than 256 pixels across the screen). This is more noticeable on PAL, where a CPU cycle isn't an integral number of pixels wide. Here's a series of video captures from PAL where the tint write moves fractions of a pixel (1/5) each time. The three lines on top are done using normal pixels, as a reference of where pixels fall. Note how the tint-drawn line moves very smoothly horizontally, at fractions of a pixel. Presumably the tint write directly sets a latch that drives a resistive adder for the tints. Makes sense.<br /><img src="http://blargg.parodius.com/temp/nes_pal_subpixels.gif" alt="Image" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sun Jul 18, 2010 10:41 pm</p><hr />

So far it's mostly theory. Going by the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NTSC_video" class="postlink">NTSC video page</a>, we see the color phases:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">111111------<br />22222------2<br />3333------33<br />444------444<br />55------5555<br />6------66666<br />------777777<br />-----888888-<br />----999999--<br />---AAAAAA---<br />--BBBBBB----<br />-CCCCCC-----<br />PPPPPPPP &lt;-- pixel width<br /></div><br />Each pixel lasts for 8 units of this. As long as a pixel contains at least one transition, the phase can be recovered. It seems so, since each cycle lasts 12 units, thus there are transitions every 6 units. Thus, an 8-unit pixel must contain at least one. If it's gray, of course, it contains zero transitions, and you would detect that as well. I think you could even recover the tint bits, since you'd always get at least one transition of that waveform as well.<br /><br />If anyone wanted to seriously make a device to do this (it would literally just connect to the RCA video out, nothing more), we'd need to first write a simulator that generated the composite waveform, then ensured that everything could be recovered in all cases. This would be pretty straight-forward. It's just that the hardware to implement it would be costly, and unless someone stepped up to purchase it AND had the expertise to build it and write the code for the microcontroller, it's going to remain just talked about here.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sun Jul 18, 2010 8:32 pm</p><hr />
