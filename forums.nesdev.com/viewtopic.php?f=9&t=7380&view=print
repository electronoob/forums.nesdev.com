		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The audio output of my NES is super buzzy taking it from the standard audio out. It's fine for listening but very poor for recording. I am playing custom made NSFs (using FamiTracker) via my PowerPak and the problem is that the buzzing is at a pitch, producing some discords.
<br />
<br />Add to that the fact that I may need to record specific channels (meaning I have to record off it multiple times for the same song) and you have a compounding of the problem.
<br />
<br />Shiru on #nesdev suggested using a battery instead of the wallwart. This seems to have helped marginally but I think most of the noise is coming from the cartridge and somewhere within the NES audio path.
<br />
<br />Since I am using the NES for recording, it seems like I could improve this anyway. I noticed that tapping directly off the CPU audio pins is MUCH better (pin 2 has a faint buzz but it is not near as bad). I found the NES audio path (on the main nesdev site) and noticed it has some funkyness to it. I suspect part of the problem is old / bad components there or some sort of grounding problem.
<br />
<br />Long story short, does anyone have any suggestions for making my own audio path? I also have a MidiBox SID and notice that the audio path there is similar. I have also seen designs online that just make use of some resistors off the chip.
<br />
<br />The goal is not to fry my precious 2A03 first, and to have better audio as an important second. A third bonus is, if I use multiple outs (one for each pin + cart out for 3 total), I can spend less time recording stuff off the NES since I could do up to 3 channels at a time.
<br />
<br />Thoughts?

<br />
<br />I think it's my RF section because the TV picture is also a bit snowy (though that comes and goes) and I have yet to get into the section itself and replace any of the caps.
<br />
<br />I certainly won't rule out interference for sure but I tried turning off most everything in my room and still had a noticeable buzz. Note that you might not hear if unless you're looking for it. It's "soft" by listening standards if you are playing games or jamming to tunes. It's just not suitable for recording since I'm mixing other sources in with it, among other things.

See <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=43786#43786" class="postlink">my last post about this</a>. To minimize the buzz, set the background color to $0D and turn off rendering while recording.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oooh maybe! Wish I knew how it sounded though - cleaning up the sound is the biggest issue for me over just amplifying it. I don't think I really need to  have one pre-made - I can build and solder things, though it is in a nice and tidy package.
<br />
<br />The only problem is that it does not include external cartridge audio. I'll need that too, although I haven't had as many problems with noise off the cartridge pin directly, although I would like to have it be at relatively the same levels. It is sort of optional though - the PowerPak is pretty much just emulating the audio chips much like FamiTracker and I'm not sure which one is better. I sort of like the noise of the cart more but that could all just be in my head.
<br />
<br />I tried to see what was going on with the board but couldn't quite make everything out given the pictures <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Definitely something to consider! I may try my hand at setting the background color tepples suggested. I would imagine it's easy to do but I haven't really dug into what is required. Since that is a cheap(er) fix might as well try it first. Of course, if it eliminates sound, I would imagine continuing with modding my NES would still produce better sound!
<br />
<br />Haha something to ponder about...

<br />
<br />Ah that's not a bad idea. I might try that on the other NES if I can fix it (I think it might be fully dead though - it just emits a loud BUZZ as soon as power is applied :/).
<br />
<br />Bypassing the normal audio out totally though would do the same thing, though, would it not? The video out you're talking about, I assume is off the PPU?
