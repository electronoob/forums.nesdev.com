		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />After working on technical stuff like 8-way scrolling, IRQs, using mappers, bankswitching, code optimization, etc ... I started to work on a game which is a revisited RPG-style game called (for now) <em>Tattoo Apprentice</em>.<br /><br />Here's what the game should be about :<br /><br />You're a young tattoo artist, trying to become a famous one. Starting in a small country village, being an apprentice in a small tattoo shop. Classic RPG-battles are replaced by timed tattooing challenges, and you have to manage your own promotion, visiting bars, clubs, ... and manage your stock (ink, needles, tattoo guns, ...).<br /><br />For now, top-down maps, 8-way scrolling, map switching, map events, NPCs, NPC interactions, music support (no SFX yet) are implemented. Tattoo challenges are nearly complete (playable though).<br /><br />Graphics are not the definitive ones, I used free work from a guy named <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=11593" class="postlink">Surt</a>.<br /><br />For the definitive graphics, I'm currently in discussion with an illustrator which is interested in the project. Waiting for some news to see if it'll happen !<br /><br />For the musics and sound effects, I got the chance to be a friend of Matt Blatte which is the brain behind the chiptune band <a href="http://www.please-lose-battle.com" class="postlink">Please Lose Battle</a>. It's placeholder music for now, but it should be changed during summer.<br /><br />Please let me know your thoughts on this project and whether I should keep up in this direction or not.<br /><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/j-_1dciQf9s" class="postlink">2016-06-13 - Preview video</a>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Unique setting, plot, and gameplay. Seems like a win-win all around. I like the idea of bringing a dexterity-based element to what is otherwise an RPG. It reminds me a bit of Qix, or more specifically the Qix-esque reveal-a-picture arcade games.<br /><br />And yeah, something to spark up the tattooing segments, stuff that makes them physically easier to do as you level up, perhaps? Or maybe have a few different minigames (could be multiple tattooing minigames or could be for the promoting or other aspects of the game), and get a little bit of a WarioWare feel with it. Other than WarioWare, games like Bishi Bashi, Cooking Mama and Trauma Center could give some inspiration. <br /><br />Anyway, Surt's graphics seem totally fine. I hope, that if you plan to replace the graphics with someone else's, none of the work was done specifically for this project.<br /><br />Small suggestion on dialog: A colon after the speaker's name or quotes around their spoken words could differentiate what is being spoken from who is speaking it.<br /><br />Look forward to seeing more.

It's just a game; the character doesn't always have to represent the player inserted into a world. It sounds like you have a lot of technical elements already implemented, plans to make a fun game and details to flesh it out, so go for it.
