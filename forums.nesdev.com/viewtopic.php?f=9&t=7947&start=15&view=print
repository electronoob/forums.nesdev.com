<br />
<br />You'd need to change VCC of the chip to 5V since it seems they are running it on 3V also.  You can lift pin 32 and run it to 5V coming from the cartridge edge pins.  Nothing else should need to be changed I don't think.  It might be advantageous to check the datasheet for the RAM though to make sure that 3V inputs (if the mapper also runs at 3V) can drive it.

<br />
<br />As for the inputs at 3V that should be OK as long as they really are 3V. Here's what the <a href="http://www.cypress.com/?docID=26107" class="postlink">datasheet</a> has to say:
<br />
<br />Vih (Input HIGH Voltage) For VCC = 4.5 V to 5.5 V : Min=2.2 V Max=VCC + 0.5 V

<br />
<br />Yeah that's fine then.  The mapper will certainly swing between 0V and 3V (if it indeed runs on 3V) since it's CMOS.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, finally got the ram after a long delay partly caused by me ordering directly from the link posted without looking at the detail. Ended up ordering the TSOP version so I had to redo the order once I got the first one.
<br />
<br />I swapped the ram chip for the new one. Lifted pin 32 to connect it to 5v . Correct me if I'm wrong though but wasn't pin 32 already connected to 5v before doing the mod? So in any case I still lifted pin 32 and ran a wire directly to one of the 5V edge pin just in case I missed something. The result was a somewhat more readable menu  and less corrupted GFX but still corrupted. The was improvement but still doesn't make the cart working properly. I tried adding the capacitor like suggested between VCC and Ground but no improvement. I even redid the solder job a second time just to be sure (it looked very well done the first time tough) and still same result.
<br />
<br />Here is the result:

<br />As you can see there was definitely an improvement! But still not usable unfortunately.

If any of them are loose it will pick the noise from your finger and the corrupted pattern on the screen will change in response to the RAM picking the 60hz (or 50 if you're in EU or AU) from your finger. 
<br />
<br />It sure looks muuuuuch better than before. The fix could be something silly like adding an pullup on the PPU data lines.

<br />
<br />I must confess I'm a bit confused after seeing the horizontal lines pattern...
<br />
<br />It's almost like if the cartridge program was trying to write to the VRAM without waiting for the PPU to be ready to take the writes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I did test for continuity and everything seem good. As for the pattern there are not really horizontal, it really depend because the corruption can vary on the menu. As for lowering voltage I'm not really sure how to achieve that safely.  But one thing is that I managed to get an almost perfect menu yesterday so I'll see if the adapter is not responsible for the rest of the corruption as the edge pin connector of those pirate carts are really short. I might try to solder the cart directly to the adapter to rule out the bad contact theory even though I tested most of the pin for continuity and didn't see a problem.
