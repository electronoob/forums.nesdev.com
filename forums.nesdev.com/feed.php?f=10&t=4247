I will see what I can contribute then.<br /><br />I would like to add some extra section to the programming one once I find the information.  When you start to program on a new platform, you always want to know which tools you can use to achieve certain goals like, for example in the case of the nes:<br /><br />- list of available assembler/compiler<br />- graphic editor for tile<br />- map editor<br />- music editor<br />and more<br /><br />Then, once I understand more the platform, if time allows me, I want to contribute some section about the common pitfalls I had when I started to program.  I'm sure most beginner ends up with the same common problems. A list of those problems with solution could be beneficial to any aspiring new nes developer.<br /><br />And maybe, instead of adding extra comment to the reference, if they are comments from a programmer's perspective, they should be added as explanation to the reference in the programmer's section.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Thu Jul 24, 2008 7:30 pm</p><hr />

Thanks Fx3 for the reference, I will read it without fail.<br /><br />Tokumaru, thanks for the information.  So you're changing the name table to be able to address more than 256 pixels (because of 8 bit limitation in away, this is how I can visualize it).  It make sense now. So when the X/Y overflow, I need to change the name table.<br /><br />When I meant about making games, I meant making game on the nes.  I did long time ago some very simple games in dos too when I was a kid, so making a game is not an issue. My issue is how to do it on the nes.  I don't think there is any documents about that.  <br /><br />I guess the more I will experiment, the more my project will shape up.<br /><br />edit: <br />Just a personal comment about flash, I have to work on a big project (not a game) in AS2 and what I can say is : hell.  The CS3 debugger is utter rubbish.

Yeah, they call those bits "Base nametable address", which isn't wrong. Just think about the width of a screen. It's 256 pixels wide, so The X scroll register (which is 8 bits wide) can address any of those pixels. Now, when there are 2 screens/nametables in a row, the total width is 512 pixels, which means you need 1 extra bit (for a total of 9) in order to address any pixel in that area. So, you can think of this bit as a "nametable selection bit" (because it indicates if the pixel you want is at the left side or at the right side), or as a 9th bit of the scroll value, for a total of 512 pixels.<br /><br />As a programmer of scrolling games, I like to think of those bits as the 9th bits of each scroll coordinate. Authors of non-scrolling games might be more comfortable referring to them as "nametable selection bits", because they just use them to pick 1 of 4 possible nametables at a time.<br /><br />About learning how to program games, that's kinda hard... I can't really suggest someone does what I did, because I started back in the DOS days, and that's just not practical at all these days. Maybe one of those Flash Game Programming books... I recently downloaded one about ActionScript 3 games that covered many of the basic principles of a game. And Flash is really great to just get things going quickly.<br /><br />Once you have the general idea of how a game works, you might see more clearly how all of that PPU and 6502 information can be put together to form something decent.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Jul 23, 2008 10:17 pm</p><hr />

Thanks for the information, I will note it down <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />Now what I would like to know is where is this information documented?  I read nestech (which everyone say is not accurate anymore) and the nes wiki but they don't mention about those attributes this way.<br /><br />My goal is to make a game that do scroll so any information related to these registers about scrolling will be greatly appreciated. <br /><br />I knew that I was setting the others bits to 0, it just since I didn't know about the msb for scrolling, I didn't see the reason to update on every scroll the PPUCTRL register.  Once you know about that, then I see why you would want to set back the NMI + other flags + XY MSB every time on a scroll since  if you don't you will lose them.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Wed Jul 23, 2008 9:20 am</p><hr />

I'm not sure what you mean by that since the msb of the PPUCTRL ($2000) is the NMI set bit.<br /></div><br />Some of the <em>other</em> bits of PPUCTRL control the msb of the X and Y scroll position.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />How is it related to the scroll and why would you want to set it every time you scroll?  This is what I'm curious about right now.<br /></div><br />Because when you set PPUCTRL, you have to set <em>all eight bits</em> of PPUCTRL. When you set the msb of the X and Y scroll position, you also set the NMI enable bit, and vice versa.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Just for other people that may read this thread, the constants used in this example are:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">PPUCTRL   = $2000<br />PPUMASK   = $2001<br />PPUSCROLL = $2005<br /><br />PPUCTRL_NMI = %10000000<br /></div><br /></div><br />And I was talking about other bit fields in the register, like these:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">PPUCTRL_OBJ8X16  = %00100000<br />PPUCTRL_BG1000   = %00010000<br />PPUCTRL_OBJ1000  = %00001000<br />PPUCTRL_VRAMDOWN = %00000100<br />PPUCTRL_Y240     = %00000010<br />PPUCTRL_X256     = %00000001<br /></div><br />When you write to one, you have to write to them all. If you do this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda #PPUCTRL_NMI<br />sta PPUCTRL</div><br />you are setting all the other bits to 0. This is fine for games that don't scroll and only use the first 4 KiB of CHR and 8x8 pixel sprites.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Jul 23, 2008 8:34 am</p><hr />
