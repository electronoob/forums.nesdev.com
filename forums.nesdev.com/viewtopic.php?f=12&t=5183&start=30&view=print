<br />Some French guy came up with a method of dumping SA-1 games on the tototek, but the site is long gone. It used to be here:

<br />All I remember is that there were a few wires involved between the cart and the slot. Something to do with those metal things built into the shell.

<br />
<br />A real system has a lot of random state on power-on. RAM, registers, etc.
<br />Unfortunately, an emulator needs to have a fixed state for many reasons (movie playback, netplay, reproducing bugs experienced by others, ...) Copiers do the same thing, but by a different means. After the BIOS finishes loading a game, they try and "reset" the system to a consistent state. When programmers rely on that, you get broken games on real hardware.
<br />
<br />Very hard for a ROM hacker to test on true hardware, but what they can do is properly initialize everything (and I do mean <em>everything</em>) upon startup.
<br />
<br />I myself have only recently been able to run tests immediately at true power-on, thanks to a modded cart from blargg. Almost all of bsnes was based upon state from copiers, so your results shouldn't be too surprising that it works like one. That said, I'll see about introducing a dev-only option to randomize the startup state in a future release.

<br />When choosing a platform to develop homebrew apps for, one has to balance a few factors:
<br /><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>the physical size of the platform (handheld vs. notebook vs. desktop/set-top) </li><li>the extent to which the platform is documented </li><li>the popularity of the platform (e.g. Pandora vs. mainstream PDAs vs. GBA and DS) </li><li>the availability of rewritable storage media (e.g. pre-PowerPak custom-made flash carts for NES vs. mass-produced flash adapters vs. SD cards) </li><li>the resolve of the platform's maker to continue to lock out newly produced freeware (PSP and Wii: heavy; DS and classic consoles: not so much) </li><li>"interesting-ness", or the difference between the platform and current personal computers </li></ol>
<br />The relative importance of these factors varies per person; in fact, some people who like to reverse engineer may prefer a less documented system. But let's analyze a few systems that I considered.
<br />
<br /><strong>PC:</strong> &lt;&gt; Not as portable as a handheld, but plenty of people own notebook PCs, and it just got better when ASUS introduced the Eee PC and opened up the low-cost subnotebook market. + POSIX and Win32 are well-known quantities. It falls down only for peripherals that aren't yet on Linux HCLs. + Everybody's got one. + Takes floppies, CDs, USB memory cards, SD cards, etc. + Wide open on Linux. And apart from Authenticode, Microsoft doesn't want to lock out Win32 app developers. - PCs are old news; the app market is saturated.
<br />
<br /><strong>GBA:</strong> + Portable. + Became well documented. + Popular. + Flash cards were available within months of launch, culminating in the SuperCard adapter that took SD cards. + Lockout was similar to the (legally ineffective) TMSS on the Genesis, defeated in three seconds once the seek/read cart bus interface was reversed. + C on a tiles+sprites 2D graphics system was a new experience for a lot of developers.
<br />
<br /><strong>Wii:</strong> - Not portable. + Documentation is improving. + Popular. + Takes SD cards. - Still being locked down (see Wii firmware 3.3, 3.4, and 4.0). - Really close to a PC in power and programming model. So <a href="http://www.pineight.com/rant/wii/" class="postlink">no thanks</a>.
<br />
<br /><strong>NES in 2000:</strong> - Not portable. - Poorly documented; people tended to use "what Nesticle does" as the reference. + Popular. - You had to solder. - You had to solder. + Interesting.
<br />
<br /><strong>NES in 2009:</strong> - Not portable (ignoring PocketNES and portable Famiclones that suck more juice than a Game Gear). + Well documented, thanks in part to Brad Taylor, loopy, kevtris, blargg, and other dedicated reverse engineers. + Popular. + PowerPak. + CIClone. + Interesting. Now you see why there was such a flurry of activity on Tetramino (now LJ65) once I got my PowerPak.
<br />
<br /><strong>Super NES with Super FX</strong> is where the NES was in 2000.

<br />
<br />I don't think that would be a problem.  AFAIK out of the extra pins on SFX carts only one was connected and out of all the SFX carts I have opened (made myself a Starfox, Starfox Competition, Starfox2 combo cart) the trace from that pin isn't connected.  In fact, I just opened up my Winter Gold FX.  It has the extra pins but they aren't connected AT ALL!
<br />
<br />As far as I can tell the main difference between a SFX cart and a normal one is extra grounding supplied by the metal spring contacts inside the cart.

<br />Yeah, and this may do all the difference. I'm pretty sure the SuperFX draws a lot of power and put the SNES power supply to its limits. That's why the chip couldn't go as high as 21Mhz and had to stick to 10.5 MHz I belive (could be wrong).

<br />
<br />That's true, but I have only every seen that pin unused in the 'glop top' SFX carts and the only examples I have seen are Starfox and Starwing.  Every other SFX cart I have (Vortex, Doom, Winter Gold, Stunt Race &amp; Yoshi's Island) have that pin unconnected.  There doesn't seem to be any significant difference between the SFX on either type of cart because I have Starfox running perfectly on a Stunt Race cart (as far as I can tell).

<br />Im glad it came so quick! And thanks for the review.
<br />
<br />Rubber feet and offering a USB cable are good ideas.
<br />
<br />As for file formats, SWC and SMC just have a 512 byte header which it ignores.  Is SFC like this? Since I don't write these headers its just BIN.
<br />
<br />I thought about mentioning NSRT too, its just that half my games aren't in the database and it doesn't tell you the correct size from the header.

<br />
<br />I can't speak the the Super Gameboy (don't have one) but like I mentioned earlier StarFox is one of the very few (if not only) games that makes use of the extra pins for the SFX chip's clock signal.  All other SFX carts I have seen have their own clock generator circuitry on cart.  I'm also beginning to think that the extra grounding springs aren't really needed.  My reasoning for this is that the only way I can play Starfox on my PAL snes is to run it through my GDSF7 (ran fine BTW) which has all the pins but the connector (barring the pins) is completely plastic and so the spring contacts on the SFX carts don't have any metal to connect to.
