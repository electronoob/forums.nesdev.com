The ENIO is really only handling the net communications for you.  It's up to you the developer to make something awesome with it.  The other choice is wait around for someone else to develop something.<br /><br />I guess it depends on the person but I don't really see the point try and surf the net or chat on the NES aside from novelty.  Things I think would be cool is playing against each other on the net.  Something like a simultaneous coop might be hard to do live, but most multiplayer NES games are turn based which could be easily supported.  I think it'd also be cool to just have a nesdev score board or something of the likes.  After publishing coding compo carts we could then have a playing compo, or bragging rights for high score and such <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  <br /><br />If it were paired with a standardized flash cart we could have a library of homebrews that could be downloaded directly to the NES.  Although that would be more of a novelty I guess...

The power pak or any basic flash/dev cart is certainly an option.  It'd also be possible to publish a cart.  Those decisions are all really up to the author of the game.  Hopefully if it's meant to be for the community as some competition all those possibilities will be included.

Isn't it? I don't think I'd really be interested in doing online stuff on my NES, but I'm sure it would be fun for somebody. Also if we could get an ENIO emulation going in an internet-capable emulator, we might be able to get a lot more people online to try.

The possibility of giving people a taste of the ENIO without buying one.  While a flag-ship project would definitely help I think something possibly more achievable is integrating it into a compo.  Sort of a few small things by a group of us to get the ball rolling.  Even if we made up a simple way for a developer to simply communicate the high score/fastest time so the ENIO wasn't the entire focus of the compo.  Just make is a side option then have ENIO's as prizes or something for both the developer and high scoring gamer.  Not sure how well we could keep people from cheating though with emu support... Guess we'd have to be on the honor system <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

I split all the ENIO specific functions into their own files, ENIO.c &amp; ENIO.h.  As promised, these will be open source.  My original implementation of the ENIO code in FCEUX was utter crap.  This one is a bit cleaner and will hopefully be easier to roll into the emulators.<br /><br />2. I owe an apology to those who already have the CPU boards and have patiently been waiting for code updates and the most recent version of the CGP protocol.  I will try to have those provided this week.<br /><br />3. I received a full panel of (30) CPU board PCB's tonight.  Assembled and tested one, everything checked out.<br /><img src="http://www.chykn.com/ENIO-CPU-1_3-Stack.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><br />4. Once I provide the aforementioned code updates and documentation, I'll start building more CPU boards.  My goal is to have (10) built in the next week.  As they are finished they will be offered to those who already purchased EXP boards.  I said before that I would not charge more than $60 for the CPU board and that anyone who purchased both EXP &amp; CPU board would get $10 off the pair.  So if you already have an EXP board, the CPU board will be $50 + $5 shipping within the US.
