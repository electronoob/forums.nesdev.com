I recall you said that the compiler declares every function as a superfree section, so the linker could put it anywhere it fits. Is it capable to put the code across the banks, or it is limited to a single bank only? I'm asking because it seems that there is a limitation for amount of code, after some point adding an extra line of code result in a 'game.s:85: INPUT_NUMBER: Out of 16bit range.<br />game.s:85: ERROR: Couldn't parse "sbc".' error message. It is always the same, no matter where the code is added. Rearranging data in other banks and splitting large functions into smaller ones does not seem to help.</div>
<br />
<br />It's the linker (wlalink) that decides where to put the sections. The compiler just instructs the linker to put the sections wherever they fit. I've never seen a section having crossed banks in any of my code, but I can't say for sure that it can't happen.
<br />
<br />Are your functions outrageously large, or just  larger than "normal"? I have some functions in my code that are maybe 300-400 lines of C code, and I don't get any problems when building my ROM.
<br />Do you have any free banks left (with enough space to hold your function)?
<br />From the error message it sounds like the instruction is trying to access some data in another bank using absolute addressing (.w). What does the line of assembly code that fails look like? And the lines around it?

<br />The error is always points to the same line, and it is always the same - very first line of a very first function:
<br />
<br />There are no free banks, but some room in some banks that should be enough. Rearranging data to have more room in a bank does not help. Even more, when I extend the ROM to the next size (adds 8 empty banks), nothing changes - the code still does not compile.

<br />
<br />It looks like the compiler has gone berserk and tried to allocate more than 64kB for local variables / temporaries in your function. You're not declaring any large non-static arrays/structs in the function, are you?

<br />
<br />This function does not have any variables. All arrays in the whole code are global, and almost all local variables in functions are declated as static. No structs in the whole code.
<br />
<br />Another thing is why not all variables are declared as static - at some point I started to get another error while adding a local static variable. Not saved this version of code, though, so can't tell what the error it was.

<br />
<br />All similar defines for other functions are in range of ~997120 to 1020021. The only define that is different is .define __main_locals 0
<br />
<br />
<br />When I remove a function from the code, so it starts to compile, all the defines are in range 0..12, 0 for the most part. So I think the problem is not related to this particular function.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah, right. Perhaps you've run into the same bug as I did once in the past. TCC has a hard limit of 1000 local labels (the ones that look like "__local_0" etc). Since these labels aren't really local it can't reuse the same ones for each function, so the 1000 limit is for an entire C file. There's no proper bounds checking, so if you surpass the limit you'll either get a compiler crash, or it'll output garbage because you overwrote something else.
<br />
<br />If you start at the end of the assembly file and search backwards for "__local_", what's the first one you find? If it has a number &gt;=1000 then that's most likely the problem. A workaround for this would be to split your code up into more C files.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This particular bug is very easy to fix. Or at least to avoid; a proper fix would be to used a dynamically growing container (like a C++ list/vector), but increasing the limit from 1000 to 16000 or 32000 would make it very unlikely that you'd hit the limit.
<br />
<br />I guess I could supply a patched compiler for Windows (Cygwin).

<br />I think there's a bug tracker at the google code page for snes-sdk. But Ulrich (the guy that created the SDK) seems to have more or less abandoned it. It might be easier to just fork the project and upload fixes to a new repo.

<br />Edit: figured it out, the problem was with the cygwin1.dll (older or something) - got the latest, and it worked. Now my code compiles without errors, great. Thanks again.
