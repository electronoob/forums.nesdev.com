<br />
<br />I'm curious as to which NES games look better with NTSC artifacts rather than without.  In my experience, Blaster Master and the Castlevania games look better with NTSC artifacts, but most early 80's (1983 - 1987) games, the Mario games and other games with bright, simplistic graphics look slightly worse.  To me, it seems to be that games with detailed, gritty graphics look better with NTSC artifacts, while games with simplistic graphics (and earlier released games) look worse.
<br />
<br />But what are other good examples of games that look good with NTSC artifacts - and those that look worse?

<br />
<br />Final Fantasy games looks quite better without them I think, but I don't know much why.
<br />I guess games with dark graphics looks better with them, while dark with more fantasic graphics looks better without them.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Games with outlined graphics will look less different, because this lessens the impact of NTSC limitations. I've encountered this issue connecting a SNES to my TV via S-Video versus composite; games like Super Mario World, Zelda: A Link to the Past, and Super Mario Kart look great with S-Video, while things like Donkey Kong Country look poor due to the pixel perfect image, but good with composite. Like you say, attempts at gradients and texturing look better with composite, because it adds more variation and texture, while S-Video or RGB exposes the limited number of colors of the system too much.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I also noticed the Genesis version of Toy Story looks more pixelated playing on an emulator than when I played it on a TV before, something that I recall a reviewer commented on as well.  I think Toy Story is also a game that looks better with composite rather than in its pixel perfect format, since I believe it renders its graphics in pseudo-3D style similar to Donkey Kong Country.
<br />
<br />IMO, the best graphic style for composite-predominant consoles would be styles that often use dithering, but still remain clear to look at - and also colorful depending on the atmosphere.  That way, games would look fine whether with or without NTSC artifacts.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A lot of Genesis games use an odd dithering technique consisting of vertical lines, rather than the usual dot pattern, because an NTSC TV will blend the lines together (though I don't know about Toy Story, never played it). Ristar makes use of this in combination with shadow mode on the map screen, and Sonic 2 uses it in Chemical Plant Zone to simulate "transparent" tubes.

<br />In fact my opinion is that most games looks fine with or without NTSC artifacts. I don't remember any game which looked horrible on the console looks good on an emulator or the other way arround.
<br />I personally am not a big fan of dithering, althrough I still use this technique sometimes. To have good graphics, I usually avoid having a large surface all using the same color unless in some particular cases (background sky or something). If you have a large place with nothing in it, add details or shadow effects. With this you will usually end up with good graphics, with and without NTSC artifacts.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Better is subjective. Some people feel that simply because the NTSC emulation generates an image that you'd also see when capturing a real NES, that it's "better". Other people may feel that, although some games have graphics that were designed with this in mind, for the vast majority of games it really doesn't matter. Myself, I'm a wholehearted advocate of the NTSC emulation. I feel it really adds that touch of "authenticity" to the experience. Plus, even if one doesn't care whether or not the artifacts are emulated, I feel that if you use the NTSC emulation with RGB presets, that it's still preferable to not using it at all, because a real RGB signal, when captured, is vertically sharp but slightly soft horizontally, and when set to RGB preset Blargg's filters exhibit this same behavior. To me, that just makes it feel more "real" (example, try running any of the VS. games with an RGB preset, it looks really good IMO).
<br />
<br />As far as Genesis games go, yeah, I'm of the belief that more games used such dithering, pretty much every main Sonic game uses it, and I've seen it in countless other games. The famed "256-color" Eternal Champions CD even used it (because in no way does it really display 256 real colors at once). It's a very effective technique on the Genesis because, at least in NTSC regions, I would guess that maybe 1% of Genesis consoles - maybe 2% at most - are hooked up with anything better than composite/RF video.

Using just this and no luma artifacts still allows crisp pixels that some people like. "RGB" on left (bleed = -1.0), "S-Video" on right (bleed = -0.25), both with resolution = +1, sharpness = +1.

If I understand "resolution" correctly as the N/Y channel bandwidth, there is no channel limit in Composite and S-Video environments. The ONLY environment where there is a limit on N/Y channel bandwidth is a radio-frequency modulated signal; here, there is a 4.2 MHz limit on the N/Y bandwidth, which means an effective resolution of 4.2 MHz * 52+59/90 µs = 221.153... pixels, down from the NES' pixel clock of Fsc*6/4 * 52+59/90 µs = 282.824... pixels. That bandwidth limit is precisely the difference between RF and composite, after all.
<br />
<br />Right now, the composite setting looks like RF, and the S-Video setting looks like a well-comb-filtered RF signal. Better change those presets. What exactly does the "Sharpness" control do?

<br />Sharpness applies edge enhancement to the resulting image, that is, where there is a delta in luma it increases this, and compensates the nearby deltas to keep the total delta the same.

On my TV, there is indeed a sharpness control. Below center, it operates like your "resolution" (Y channel filtering, with no filtering at center), above center, it operates like your "sharpness" (edge enhancement). It might be less confusing if you combined the two in the manner I've described, and clearly indicated the center position with no filtering and no edge enhancement.

The Apple IIe in 80-column text mode and "double hi-res" mode was capable of generating a signal all the way up to 7.2 MHz for use with specialized monitors, but TVs of the time couldn't display it clearly. This is because they used a crossover circuit to separate the luma (0-3.0 MHz) from the chroma (3.0-4.2 MHz). Composite computer monitors such as the ones that filled school computer labs appear to have used a (more expensive) notch filter, along with a "monochrome" button to ignore the color burst and disable all chroma processing. The advantage of baseband over RF wasn't the ability to handle signals above 4.2 MHz as much as fewer processing steps, where each step introduces noise and filter roll-offs.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> The ONLY environment where there is a limit on N/Y channel bandwidth is a radio-frequency modulated signal; here, there is a 4.2 MHz limit on the N/Y bandwidth, which means an effective resolution of 4.2 MHz * 52+59/90 µs = 221.153... pixels</div><br /><div class="quotetitle">Harry Nyquist wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">You forgot to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem" class="postlink">double it</a>.<br /><br />Oh, and the Y is short.

<br />For a signal in monochrome mode (luma up to 4.2), the horizontal resolution is 442 pixels. With the crossover, this drops to 3.0 MHz * 2 * (52 + 2/3) µs = 316 pixels, very close to the "320x240" commonly quoted for LDTV and each field of SDTV.
<br />
<br />Some of the richness of color in games that use dithering, like Blaster Master, comes from aliasing. An isolated pixel looks different depending on where the pixel falls relative to the phase of the color subcarrier.

<br />They cannot be used <em>predictably</em>, except that they are guaranteed to differ from one 8x8 or 16x16 pixel metatile to the next. The games that use subcarrier crosstalk artifacts rely on the effect when they are used <em>unpredictably</em>.
