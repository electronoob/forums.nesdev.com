<br />
<br />The led isn't in the current version of kazzo firmware.  That's something you guys requested so I added into the hardware.  So it never actually lights up if you don't touch the firmware.  I've been playing around with the bootloader making my own simple firmware programs to do things like erase dev carts or overwrite single bytes and such.  For things like that you can easily make use of the LED and I have for simple indication/debugging purposes.  Make sure you put the LED in properly though.  If you look inside the lens of the LED the fat internal lead is the ground side.
<br />
<br />Also don't worry about any of the jumpers with the current firmware.  I need to formally put everything together this weekend about what changes I made to the circuit so someone could figure out how to make use of them with firmware upgrades or their own firmware.

<br />
<br />Seems to work somewhat OK, I got a lot of bad dumps but got good ones eventually.  The bad dumps were almost always 100% different even when I didn't touch anything between attempts.  On one bad dump, only the first 256 bytes were bad (software bug?).  I'm surprised that the connector works, but it seems to.  No shorts, even if I slide the board towards either side.
<br />
<br />Pretty cool device, but it definitely doesn't compare favorably to CopyNES (except for it being a convenient little stand-alone device).  It's virtually impossible to get a bad dump with CopyNES (you can play the game before/after dumping it - bad connections are a huge problem with NES, as we all know).  I was also a little surprised by how slow this is - it took about 19 seconds to copy 128kB of PRG-ROM, which is about 7kB/sec.  CopyNES (original version) I guess transfers around 30kB/sec, but I don't know how fast the USB CopyNES clone is.
<br />
<br />Hopefully it could get better with some software updates.

I was just too excited to assemble it that I didn't think of the space needed for the MCU:)  I just started playing with it but couldn't find my old nes cart at the moment and all I had to test was a Vegavox music album cart from Alex Mauer, Super Mario Bros. and a famicom UNROM socketed cart that I use with EPROM or flash chip. I was able to dump duck tale from the Famicom dev cart without problem. Well, except for when I carelessly put my flash chip backward and it started to overheat like crazy with the smell of burned silicon and plastic but that was my own mistake and not something that could happen with regular cart:0 Surprisingly, the chip was ok, the data was all wiped out but it was fine after cooling off and being erased by my eprom programmer. As for the Vegavox and Mario cart, I might be stupid but couldn't figure out how to dump those as I couldn't find any script for such a board.

I like the kazzo because it's cheap and isn't proprietary like the USB CopyNES.  And you don't have to hack up a NES to make it.

<br />
<br />What mapper does the Vegavox use?  Which version of SMB?  There are several different mappers SMB was built with: NROM, MHROM, MMC1 (SFROM) which one you've got would dictate which mapper script you needed and the only one on that list with a script currently written is NROM.   So we'd have to get a script together if you had anything besides the standalone SMB.

<br />
<br />OK, with InfiniteNESLives help I was able to get this working on my laptop with Win7 64-bit without issue so far. My problem was the switch was flipped to bootloader mode, um heheh.

<br />I had to go here:  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/libusb-win32/wiki" class="postlink">http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/libusb-win32/wiki</a> to get the driver working like I said above.
<br />
<br />But I was still having an issue where I was getting a device read error before the dump even starts or half way through.  If I tried over and over I could eventually get a full dump.  I don't know if it's an issue with my computer or what.  I'm running windows7 on a 64 bit machine.  I haven't had an issue once with my 32bit XP machine.

I can't seem to find the supported flash chip list though. I have a 256k winbond and 256k amic but as of now didn't managed to flash it using the kazzo. I'll continu to play with it though.

<br />
<br />What game is it?  Do you know anything about the mapper?  Are there already dumps of that game out there?  
<br />
<br />I'm not sure what you mean by research.  Does the copyNES have functions to investgate the operations of an unknown mapper?  You could conceivably do something like that with the kazzo but you'd have to write all the scripts and programs yourself and share.  There's nothing already set up like that to my knowledge.
