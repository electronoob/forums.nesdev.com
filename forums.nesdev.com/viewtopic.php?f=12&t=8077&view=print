		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />the SNES expansion port?
<br />
<br />I'm planning to learn NESasm, SNESasm, and then call a friend of mine who knows a lot about hardware, we plan to do a SNES-CD.
<br />
<br />I was thinking about using a Z80 for processor (even some people in the NESDev board said it was confusing to use) and build some devtools that could make Game Making for it as easy as eating pie.
<br />
<br />The design tool would be (or will if i can build it) the sort of thing that Game Maker is for PC. Less coding, more gaming.
<br />
<br />The extra APU would be the same the Mega Drive uses, the YM2612 (Yes, that's right. I love the meow sound of this chip)
<br />
<br />Extra GPU? YM7101.
<br />
<br />This might be just a dream, but i would like to know if it is possible...

And what needs added on that the SNES can't do by it's self? Also, it works differently from 65 chips, so you may want to see if it's even doable within X ammount of parts.

<br />
<br />I'd sorta complain about using a Z80 for that too, unless it performs notably better than the SNES CPU it doesn't seem all that interesting.  The video and sound registers might as well be mapped to the SNES directly, so it can get straight to it.  I think a better CPU would be something like the MIPS or ARM.  They should be fast enough to emulate a Z80 or 6502, if one didn't want to program in native assembly or C.
<br />
<br />Even better would be using an FPGA to recreate all those (or create new) functions in a single chip.
<br />
<br />Sure any of this stuff is possible, but just depends on what you want to do with it.
<br />
<br />There are those clone systems around that include an SNES and Genesis inside, maybe there would be some way to modify it and bridge the systems?

<br />
<br />It looks like my SNES is with a very old cart slot. I also upped an image of the obscure f-zero cart here: <img src="http://oi55.tinypic.com/14w4rh5.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Seriously, and it wasn't even criminal market. Strange enough, in Brazil our carts are similar to the American ones, and this looks European, here is the picture of it open.<img src="http://oi51.tinypic.com/29osev9.jpg" alt="Image" /> And now, we can see the cart broke. Anyone can tell me if my SNES can still be fixed? Also, the EEPROM was REALLY cheap. Doesn't F-zero uses a special chip? Forget it. I didn't find any special chip on it. just a Taiwan made EEPROM with FO written on it.
<br />
<br />Sorry for big pics!

<br />Edit/add: Interesting though the system's running on PAL-M mode, the sound is not slowed down. The APU and CPU work just fine, but the GPU's got problem.
