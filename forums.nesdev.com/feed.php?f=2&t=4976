Would an MMC3 without CHR bank switching fit?<br /><br />Take the MMC3, and fix its CHR banks to values that span 8 KiB (0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7). For example, a CHR RAM game such as MM4, MM6, or FF3 might use them this way. That frees up 48 flip-flops: 46 for the CHR bank registers and 2 for bits 2-1 of $8000. Now how many macrocells are left? Is it one macrocell for each flip-flop?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Mar 26, 2009 3:52 pm</p><hr />

Perhaps because it can't fit onto the same CPLD he's got stocked, MMC3 takes a little over 80 macrocells (need XC95108), MMC1 is just shy of 30 (need XC9536). It could also be because a true, non-hacked IRQ counter hasn't been worked out, MMC3 is still buggy on the PowerPak for me <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Thu Mar 26, 2009 2:15 pm</p><hr />

Bunnyboy, since MMC3 and FME7 mappers have been created for the PowerPAK FPGA, does that help you in being able to eventually make a reproduction board of MMC3 with a CPLD or some other device? It's pretty cool that the MMC1 board is available, but I've wondered why MMC3 hasn't followed, is there some technical limitation in the way?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Thu Mar 26, 2009 12:20 pm</p><hr />

But most people aren't looking for a super mapper, they are looking for something around MMC3 level.  While I haven't yet seen a homebrew that actually needs something that big I am sure a few people are working on games that do.  SMB shows a good game can be basic hardware, but SMB3 shows a good game can be more advanced hardware too.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=228">bunnyboy</a> — Tue Mar 24, 2009 4:47 pm</p><hr />

Building some kind of super-mapper is somehow undermining the whole point of coding for an obsolete game system, because if you want better graphics or sound, then choose a modern platform. I mean, shouldn't it be about the challenge to see what you could have done if you were a NES developer back in the day? What creative way you can come up with to deal with the limitations of this old architecture? Perhaps even design a good game while you're at it?<br /><br />Designing a good game is the hardest part of all, and no extra RAM or super mapper will help you much with that if your idea sucks. People underestimate how much work went into the design of those classic games, thinking they can surpass those efforts with additional hardware.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3760">6502freak</a> — Tue Mar 24, 2009 3:42 pm</p><hr />

If I'm not mistaking, that could select up to 256 different 8k banks, which would make the max size 2048k. Either way, 512k is possible because FF3 has it, and 512k is enough. I plan to have 256k of that data be CHR data. And I need it uncompressed because the NMI routine can update CHR data from ROM during Vblank, and if the data was compressed that wouldn't fly so well.<br /><br />The idea of a new mapper is pretty cool, but Bregalad is right in saying that you don't need a mega-mapper to make a good game. I'm not exactly using a mega mapper (though 512k of PRG data is a lot, kind of), and I hope to blow everyone away with what I come out with. Though it would be hard to make emulators support a new mapper. And there are a bunch of values for the mapper ID that aren't used, but while everyone's adding support for a new mapper for all these emulators, the NES header format should be updated because there are a lot of flaws with it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Mar 22, 2009 2:57 pm</p><hr />
