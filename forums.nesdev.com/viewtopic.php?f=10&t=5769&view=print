		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi. I'm new to all this and need some help. It's simple, I want to know if it's possible to simply burn an NES rom of my choice to two EEPROM chips (one for PRG and one for CHR) and with the correct mapper chip, soldier them into an nes board and make it run on an NES? I've looked up several websites online and have come across a program such as readnes to split the rom into a prg and chr and looked up what equipment and parts I need.
<br />
<br />Here is the ROM I want to burn, in readnes:

<br />
<br />I noticed it says:
<br />NES PRG: 40 CHR: 40 MAPPER: 10 E0
<br />Nintendo MMC1
<br />
<br />Does this mean I need two 27C040 DIP eproms or 29F040 DIP flash chips and an MMC1 mapper chip and boom it'll work?
<br />
<br />I was planning on buying one of these:

<br />
<br />and one of these:

<br />
<br />I'm sorry if all this info is completely off and/or I'm stupid for thinking that making NES carts like the one I want to make is possible. I just need to know if I'm on the right path here or if I'm completely off target with this whole thing.

<br />Yes, that's the way to do it. If you use ReproPak you simply solder the eprom/flashrom in, but if you use a board from an old game you need to do some re-wiring as the pinouts of the original mask roms don't match with eprom/flashrom (in most cases).
<br />
<br />EDIT: About that ROM of yours, I don't think ReproPak supports 1MB PRG/512KB CHR so you might have to think of an alternative solution for that.

<br />
<br />Ah I was afraid of that. What about this ROM? It's a little smaller, think the ReproPak would be able to support it?

<br />
<br />I noticed the CHR is 0 bytes though. Does this mean that this ROM only needs one eeprom for the PRG?
<br />
<br />Thanks for the help btw, yeah I was afraid those pirate carts would be a little too big  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> but was hoping I can make one because I always wanted one. After that I would move onto ROM hacks and unreleased games. I was already aware of the rewiring that would be required with boards from old NES games and was hoping I could avoid that by just buying those ReproPaks .   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

However, from <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/AxROM" class="postlink">this wiki page</a> it seems that the standard AxROM board has a maximum of 256KB of ROM, and your game needs 512KB. Maybe it's possible to modify the board a bit so that it can take large games, but one would have to debug the game in order to see how it expects the mapper to act, and this is not such a trivial thing to do.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I noticed the CHR is 0 bytes though.

<br />Games that have 0KB of CHR-ROM come from boards that have 8KB (very few games use other sizes) of CHR-RAM. When modifying a cart of this kind you only have to program and replace the PRG chip. If you use a ReproPak you'll have to solder a RAM chip on the CHR side.

And at that point, you could just write your own menu for that mapper, as I did for <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Forbidden_Four" class="postlink">Forbidden Four</a>. It appears the MMC1 ReproPak supports SUROM, so Forbidden Four could be easily ported.
