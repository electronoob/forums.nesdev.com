People who are passionate about something don't mind frequent changes, but people who just want to use something and have it be consistent are not. E-mail is boring, just give me the ability to send and receive, and stop trying to flip every paradigm on its head.<br /><br />I see the effect in all software: emulators, web browsers, instant messengers, e-mail clients, etc. At least with my software (eg desktop apps), if you hate my new direction, you can download a previous release. Write it off as unsupported, disregard bug reports, and everybody's happy.<br /><br />I pretty much only use Google for search anymore.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">in twenty years, if I want to replay a game that I had owned as a downloadable copy, but the hard drive in the xbox has gone sour, how can I possibly replay the game?

The common argument is &quot;they won't want to play it in twenty years&quot; but we still have Atari systems and Famicoms and such...</div><br /><br />A lot of these games are starting to be online only, even games that don't have any business being so (like Sim City.)<br /><br />It's serious work to RE and emulate a game server. Especially as their DRM and crypto keeps getting more and more difficult to crack. One game server tends to be its own project.<br /><br />There's no getting around it, there <em>will</em> be a gap in history where future societies will have no access to that time period's culture. In fact, we've already lost about 80% of the unique content on the Satellaview service for the SNES. If copyright and law had its way, we would have zero gaming history preserved at the moment (Pong came out in '72, copyright lasts for life of the author (average lifespan ~84 years) + 70 extra years.)<br /><br />Everyone's making noise about the Link to the Past 2 for the 3DS. Only problem is we already have LttP's sequel: Inishie no Sekiban. Nintendo was all too happy to erase it, as well as the only graphical upgrade remake of the original Zelda.

The infamous (and somewhat misunderstood) burning of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria" class="postlink">Library of Alexandria</a> is a conceptual example.<br /><br />Preservation of information requires more than a durable media, it must be curated.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&gt; Yeah, at least they don't go around removing useful features from that. Oh, wait...<br /><br />Yep. They killed Code Search, and they are trying harder and harder to hide their cache. Have to invoke the latter manually now with this URL prefix:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache">http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache</a><!-- m -->:<br /><br />&gt; Google's main product of course is ads, not these services.<br /><br />The problem is that they are trying to push their products into business environments, and to replace traditional desktop applications. Things like Google Docs. As a CIO, their actions would scare me away from their ever considering their products in my company. Why train 5,000 people on a product that can be killed off tomorrow with a three-month notice?<br /><br />&gt; Now if I search &quot;[insert random word]&quot;, pretty much all the time Google will point out to wikipedia article of [some random word]. If I wanted to search for that, I'd directly use wikipedia.<br /><br />Yeah, that one pisses me off, too. Wikipedia's notability criteria mean that shitty, popular information trumps expert knowledge. As such, most of their info is piss-poor. I keep trying to get my emulator's page deleted (lots of errors on it), but they keep recreating it.<br /><br />I'd recommend Personal Blocklist for Chrome. Should be a Firefox equivalent. You can automatically remove Google search results, so you never see crap from Wikipedia or wn.com or developerSexchange.com again.
