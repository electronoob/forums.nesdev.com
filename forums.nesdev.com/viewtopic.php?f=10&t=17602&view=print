If I make a game for the NES, will I also be able to play it on the Famicom?<br />I know that their cartridge pinouts are a bit different, but in every NES emulator I tried, famicom games also seemed to work.<br /><br />I'm extremely new to NES development. In fact, I just got interested in it today and I'm looking forward to learning a lot.<br />I have some hardware hacking/circuit design experience as a hobbyist and know some C by programming microcontrollers.<br />Nope, I never tried assembly before!<br /><br />Thanks!

It can be obscure stuff like attempting to read the primary PPU OAM (not possible on early famicoms) - stuff you hardly need or want.

So yes, they are more or less the same thing in a different case, so much that emulators don't even make a distinction.

The only one that will make a difference is a PAL nes (speed is different). But as a beginner, for now you do not need to worry about such details yet.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah Famicom and NTSC NES are pretty much the same on the inside, so the possible compatibility problems are few, but here are a few things to think about to maintain compatibility with both Famicom and NES:<br /><br />START, SELECT and the microphone on controller II.<br />Just make sure none of these inputs are required in the game. For example if player 2 may pause with START, people with red &amp; white Famicom (or Twin Famicom) will not be able to pause (and that may be fine in your game as long as player 1 always can pause). And if you use the microphone for anything, make sure it's not a requirement to proceed in the game (although some <a href="http://www.famicomworld.com/forum/index.php?topic=2355.0" class="postlink">licensed games do exactly this</a>) or else people with NES, AV Famicom and most Famiclones will not be able to play your game.<br /><br />You may want to use a controller reading routine that respects external controllers connecting to the Famicom expansion port. This way external controllers can be used besides the built-in ones.<br /><br />If your game supports 3 controllers or more, or use certain other external accessories there may be differences to think about.<br /><br />Finally you are better off not reading register $2004 to maintain compatibility with earlier PPUs, but you probably normally don't need to read it anyway.

It was more common that a region had a different look in the past either for aesthetic/taste of the region or in the case of the nes so it doesn't look like a video game system (atari), it was an &quot;entertainment system&quot;, like a vcr. whoa..

So if you make 1000 NTSC US carts, its a SKU, if you then make another 1000 NTSC US carts, it the same SKU. If you make a 1.1 version, if that is the to be a new SKU or not is probably up to you, however I would expect the 1.1 to have the same SKU, unless you want people to stock and order 1.1 or 1.0.  <br />Targeting PAL A and PAL B and US and JAPAN are all different SKUs. Although the PAL A and PAL B have no differences in the NES portion from a coding standpoint and it is just a difference CIC chip on the board. However a PAL and NTSC version are different, or at least they should be different, but some games can probably get away with just swapping the CIC chip for either A or B. But then I would also expect A and B to have different languages on the game and/or manual. <br /><br />On a system like the PS4 where their is no region locking, then there are no separate models. However on a PS3 you have NTSC-J, NTSC-U, NTSC-C and PAL, which are different releases and you can't run a J on a U or a PAL. There are small software based differences between the models and how a game should operate, but their is no physical difference in the capabilities of the machine, unlike a Famicom and an NTSC US NES.

Lots of stuff gets customized for a locale, whether or not there's a region locking mechanism to prevent it from being exported from there. (...and the PS3 did have those SD video output standards to wrangle, as I guess Oziphantom was pointing out, though much of that could be handled by the system in an automated way.)<br /><br />(I hope by the time the term &quot;stock keeping unit&quot; was uttered, OP had a good understanding that Famicom and NES are nearly identical machines.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />my point is - people see the famicom as different to a nes because it is different. Different carts, different name, different marketing, different hardware features. In that if I take a US NES game I can't use it on a Famicom, if I take a NES controller I can't use it on a Famicom.<br /><br />My Point with the PS4 is they all look the same, same controller, same hardware and yes there is no region locking. Hence it is not a fair comparison to the NES/Famicom.<br /><br />The PS3 is region locked, however 99.98% or so of games ship on region free disks. The PSN is rather locked down, to the point it has its own internal folder for each region. So if you buy a game on the UK store, but then buy the DLC on the US store. The DLC and Game can not see each other, I think save games are also in their &quot;own territory&quot; <br />If you look at this <a href="https://art.gametdb.com/ps3/coverfullHQ/US/BCUS98132.jpg?1332960012" class="postlink">https://art.gametdb.com/ps3/coverfullHQ/US/BCUS98132.jpg?1332960012</a>  notice the globe with 1 on it. On my EU and Japanese copy it has a 2 in the icon. Although I don't think HS is region locked.. can't remember if it was or not.
