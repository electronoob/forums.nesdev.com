		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello all,<br /><br />I've recently become quite interested in SNES and SNES hardware. I'm by no means an expert on the subject matter, thus I'm looking to learn as much as I can by starting up a small project. Simply put, I'm looking to drop a nice FPGA chip into a game cartridge, and using it as a learning tool. I wont go into the details but I'm looking to get a PCB board manufactured. The issue is, from my searching SNES cartridge PCB boards are 1.2mm thick, while 99% of PCB printing companies will print you 1.6mm. (Some offer 0.8mm)<br /><br />I figure a 1.6mm would damage the snes cardedge connector, while the 0.8mm would make an unreliable connection. Do you know of any companies willing to print 1.2mm boards, at a fair price?<br /><br />I've found makepcb.com will print them, but I feel that company is sketchy and has had accuracy problems. (Plus reported 8-10 week delivery time)<br />I've also found apcircuits.com however they seem to charge a heavy premium for 1.2mm boards. (Upwards of 400 bucks)<br /><br />Does anyone know of others?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Matt

Check out iTead Studios, they offer a 2-layer 10cmx10cm board for $22, no extra charge for 1.2mm thickness (thicknesses &lt;1.0mm are reasonably cheap) <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://imall.iteadstudio.com/open-pcb/pcb-prototyping/im120418002.html">http://imall.iteadstudio.com/open-pcb/p ... 18002.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Also, if you're interested, I have a PCB outline in EAGLE for all 3 of the standard board shapes (the tiny, no-RAM boards, the standard board, and the large board with the expansion wings).  I had to shave the edges down ~1mm on each side to fit within the 10cm size requirement, but they should still fit snug.  If you're interested, let me know.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I'm fine open sourcing my library.  It's a bit of a mess at the moment, so give me a bit to clean things up a little and I'll send it your way.  I'd prefer if you didn't publish the library (mostly because it's a work in progress right now), but schematics can be published without including the libraries without any issues (the only thing is that anyone who downloads the schematic without the library can't edit the footprints).  If somebody asks you for the library, I'm fine with you giving it out, I would just rather it not get posted publicly for the time being (again, only due to the current WIP status, I plan to publish it myself eventually).

They even provide Eagle DRC rules which will make my life far easier. <br /><br />Qwertymodo, I'll keep my eyes on this thread for EAGLE libraries if you would like to post your work. So far I've been using the library for SD2SNES which I pulled out of their GIT. Yours sounds like it would work better given you have explicitly designed it to fit the 10cm requirement. <br /><br />Thanks a lot for this info!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The downside of batch PCB services like iTead is the long lead time.  It easily takes a month to 6 weeks minimum before you get your order back.  But their quality is excellent.  Even though they allow traces down to 6mil, I'd suggest staying at 10 or greater.  Also, I emailed them and they said that they are capable of producing &quot;gold fingers&quot; (the fabrication name for cart edge connectors), so you're good there.  Also, depending on the features you need, check out FusionPCB SeeedStudio as well.  I believe they use the same fab house as iTead (meaning same quality), but they offer different price breakdowns for different features.  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/fusion-pcb-service-p-835.html">http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/fusion ... p-835.html</a><!-- m -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey Qwertmodo,<br /><br />Are you still willing to put up your Eagle libraries for SNES cart PCBs? I have picked up a SA-1 PCB (bought PGA Tour 96 for basically nothing at the flea market) and I figure it is a good board to try to replicate. It is fairly square, not too odd of a shape and looks like it could be made to fit the 10x10 cm iTead limit, and the 4&quot; x 3&quot; limit of the Eagle free edition. Plus, has the expansion wings. Ideally I'd like to be able to print a board that will fit inside a real cart. If this is one of the boards you have a design for that would be super, otherwise I am still interested in what you have. I could possibly hit up the flea market again looking for another dirt cheap game to fit it inside. Worst case the cart case can have a date with a dremel and superglue, or even worse case, it could be a board with no case sticking out of the SNES cart slot hehe. <br /><br />Anyways, let me know! Thanks!

I don't have any footprints for any of the special chips, so you're on your own there.  I do, however, have footprints for the D411, MAD-1, SRAM (narrow and wide, plus the narrow/wide combo footprint you see on most boards), Mask ROM (32/36pin), plus I have footprints for the SuperCIC (DIP and surface-mount) and AM29F032B.  Yes, I'm willing to share, but for now just PM me.  At some point, when I feel it's more complete, I will likely post it publicly, but for now I've just been handing it out in PM's.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have calipers.  If I remember, I can measure it.  It's definitely not a standard QFP-112, since there are 30 pins on one side and 26 on the other.  QFP-112 is square.  However, I have a feeling that the pitch is probably the same (0.65mm).  Also, note that according to the silkscreen, pin 112 is actually where you'd expect pin 1 to be (so you might check that your pinout accounts for this as well...), so as you count around the chip, you have 112,1...29|30...55|56...85|86...111, and the corner dot is actually at the corner of pin 85|86... which is weird.  I haven't actually measured it with calipers, but you can always print out the footprint and see how it looks once you're done.  With that many pins, it would be pretty obvious if you were off by even .125mm (which would be the closest standard pitch).
