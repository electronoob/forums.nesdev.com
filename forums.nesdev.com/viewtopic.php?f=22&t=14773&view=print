Now <em>that's</em> pretty awesome.<br /><br />Here's what I came up with for the 1k Series today. It's a Tron cycle style game. I made one as a bonus game on another cart I released, but really wanted to try a 1k version sometime, as I felt like I could do it. I pulled it off, but it's 2-player only. I attempted AI with it, but there just wasn't enough room to have AI or 2-player. And with 2-player, a lot of code got looped with an offset, so it just made more sense. Ask some people in #nesdev how bad the simple AI I had was hahaha It was horrible.<br /><br />But anywho, here it is. I didn't go through and optimize it as much as I usually do, but will sometime for sure.<br /><br /><a href="http://slydogstudios.org/s/The%20One%20with%20the%20Walls.zip" class="postlink">http://slydogstudios.org/s/The%20One%20with%20the%20Walls.zip</a>
