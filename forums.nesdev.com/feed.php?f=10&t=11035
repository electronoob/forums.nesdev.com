Yeah, Portopia was the other alleged RPG not to use bankswitching.  So I would guess that would make Hydlide one of a kind, huh? <br /><br />I've been looking up the MMC5 chip that Matt mentioned to get a good idea of what kind of bang developers could get for their buck, which coincidentally took me to another thread on this forum, <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=513" class="postlink">here</a>. I have to say, I'm certainly learning a lot as I go, thanks to you guys! It really gives me a new found appreciation for the considerations that went, (and still does,) into programming games for the NES.

Yeah, I can verify that Hydlide had scrolling added to it when it was ported to the MSX, so you're most likely right that this was the version the port was based off of. Additionally, it sounds like the music for the NES game came straight from Hydlide 2. Probably because, while Hidlyde had some different tracks, they were composed of nothing but short chirps and beeps.<br /><br />The points you bring up about scrolling are also very interesting. I noticed that scrolling within Hydlide was pretty awkward, but assumed that sort of scrolling was improved as devs got a better hold of the NES hardware. It's interesting that the NES had hardware based scrolling available. I wonder how much better Hydlide could have been if they had redesigned the game from the ground up for the NES?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6416">SuperDerek</a> — Fri Feb 21, 2014 1:08 pm</p><hr />

Ahh, Hydlide.  Packing an RPG game into an NROM is certainly a feat, but I agree with tokumaru.  From a technical perspective, I think that the nametable and scrolling setup is what makes this game peculiar.<br /><br />Scrolling is done fully in software, and is quite slow and choppy as a result.  In order to use hardware scrolling though, the status bar on the right would have to have been eliminated, or an MMC5 would be needed ($$$$$).<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/5QjHhcR.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Even given all that, it seems like they should have been able to improve the performance by a sort of &quot;double buffer&quot; strategy, where one nametable is on screen and one is being drawn to.  It doesn't speed things up because you can still only edit the &quot;backbuffer&quot; during vblank, but it would have eliminated the tearing that is so obvious in the game when you scroll.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5719">natt</a> — Fri Feb 21, 2014 12:05 pm</p><hr />

I have never played Hydlide, but from looking at it I see something very peculiar: it doesn't use the hardware registers for scrolling, instead it redraws the entire gameplay area to simulate scrolling. This is most likely replicated from the original version, which probably ran on a video chip that didn't have hardware scrolling.<br /><br />Software scrolling isn't common on the NES, because programs only have a small portion of a frame's time for screen updates, and that time is not enough to update an entire screen, so the effect looks very choppy, while hardware scrolling can be perfectly smooth (but can't be done with those bricks around the gameplay area).<br /><br />EDIT: Looks like I was wrong. I looked at the PC-88 version and it doesn't have scrolling at all. There's actually a pretty long black screen between screens. Maybe the NES version is based on the MSX one?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Feb 21, 2014 11:42 am</p><hr />

Is bankswitching costly? Or is this more likely related to the fact that this game is a port of an older PC-6001/8801 title, and that programming the game to utilize bankswitching would require substantial rewriting of the entire game's code?<br /><br />Thank you for your time, and any light you might be able to help shed on these questions for me.<br /><br />-Derek<br /><br /><em>Edit:<br />Looks like that bit about it being one of only 2 games that used bankswitching was completely wrong -- I misread an article which stated it was one of only 2 RPGs that used bankswitching. Big difference there, and I thank you guys for helping to clear that up! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></em><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6416">SuperDerek</a> — Fri Feb 21, 2014 10:39 am</p><hr />
