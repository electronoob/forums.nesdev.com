Thanks about the compliment on SMW and for the invite to hack Aladdin with you.<br /><br />Right now I'll have to decline it, sorry. I wish I had more free time for it - but right now I'm finishing my first video game and all my hacking projects are on hold.<br /><br />I wish all the best for your project and please keep this topic updated with images. I'm very curious too see what will happen.<br /><br />EDIT (contradicting myself completely):<br />While I can't commit to make a full (or half!) hack, I'd be more than happy to help with small tasks.

And I *personally* think it's better to sacrifice a good looking apple to put a good-looking Aladdin on screen. At least on stage 1 there are no other red objects than apple and half of Aladdin.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It seems like there's two possible ways to solve this dilemma; either stay with the default palette, or rebuild the graphical assets to have a more optimized color system, maybe switch colors out when they are no longer in use for anything, if at all possible.  The guard, for example, would suffice just being skin tone/white/black, and you could probably layer some sprites on him to give him color.  His palette could also be used for Aladdin's main body, with a sprite for his hat, waist, and shirt.  Of course, you'd have to fight flicker all the time if you chose to go this way, but the game already has very few enemies moving around at once.  In hindsight, it's almost exactly how the pirate game handles the colors, so I guess you could discount what I said.

Realistically speaking, the NES's red is already sort of brown anyway.<br /><br />Of course, we could also question the integrity of stage's palette for the buildings and backdrops compared to the SNES version. That's probably what I'll look into next.<br /><br />I know these sidequests may not be very entertaining, but, damnit, I'd like to make a good hack. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" />
