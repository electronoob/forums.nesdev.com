		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have noticed that my Yobo FamilClone (part number OT-8008). I have noticed that on some games the music goes a little askew every now and then. For instance, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. But two days ago I picked up a copy of Crystalis from a local reseller, and it sounds like absolute dirt. About every other note is *very* flat, turning the music I once loved into non-stop pain.
<br />
<br />Does anyone know what causes this? I've read in an old post that there are "duty cycle problems", and something about the duty cycles on the square waves being "swapped", but nothing too specific.
<br />
<br />And is there any way I can make my homebrew games sound decent on both the original hardware and these clone systems?

Now provided you could reprogram a cartridge you could swap the duty cycles in the software so that it sounds right on the messed up clone and wrong on the authentic hardware. 
<br />
<br />In theory homebrew could have an option to allow for swapping duty cycles so if played on a clone system it would still sound correct if the user enabled the swap. 
<br />
<br />The best solution is to just use authentic hardware. Leave the cheap clones to people that don't know better.

I used to like clones because that's all I had before I could buy a real NES. Now that I have some authentic units, I don't ever touch the clones anymore. Even if it's not easy, you should put some effort into buying the real thing, it really is worth it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Plus wouldn't support for the clones be a requirement of modern homebrew development?</div><br />I'm not sure... Just like I wouldn't want my games to be played on Nesticle I wouldn't want them to be played on inaccurate clones. As a big fan of accuracy, I'd feel kinda bad about legitimizing these cheap clones as actual NES variations.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Does anyone have details or can give a more detailed explanation of this "swapped duty cycles" thing?</div>
<br />The NES has 4 different configurations for how long the sound waves stay up and how long they stay down within their period (I'm not sure if the terminology is right here, I'm not very good with music stuff). Clones got these ratios inverted: when the waves are supposed to stay up 75% of the time and down 25% of the time, they do the opposite, 25% up and 75% down. Something like that.

<br />
<br />Hell no. Supporting incorrect clones is up to the individual author. Really no one should bother supporting it unless their target market is one that the NES or Famicom was not officially released in. Even still, the hope would be that someone would fully clone the NES <strong>correctly</strong> instead.

<br />At first, I'd recommend running Blargg's tests on clones to get some ideas for how to detect them at startup. But there are a few problems: 1. Blargg appears to have left the community for some reason, and 2. the PowerPak is said not to even boot on clones, so only someone who knows how to solder would be able to just buy one and run the existing test suites.

<br />
<br />In my opinion these clones are the future of the NES scene. Like it or not, the number of functioning NES units gets smaller and smaller every day. These clones are a new breath of life for an aging hardware platform. And with so many out in the wild now, I feel like I pretty much have to support them.
