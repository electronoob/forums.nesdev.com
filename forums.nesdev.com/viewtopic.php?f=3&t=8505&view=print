		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm trying to understand why I get random splotches of black in SMB: <a href="http://img545.imageshack.us/img545/3722/mariohasblack.png" class="postlink">image</a>
<br />
<br />I tried debugging it for a particular pixel (152,52). The relevant info for that was:
<br />
<br />nametableAddr=0x20D3
<br />mem[nametableAddr]=0x24 (i.e. tile 0x24)
<br />attributeAddr=0x23CC
<br />mem[attributeAddr]=0x55 (i.e. 1-1-1-1 for 2-bit attribute sections - I choose the bottom-right one, but they're all the same in this case.)
<br />bgPaletteIndexWithoutAttribute=0 (blue)
<br />bgPaletteIndexWithAttribute=4 (0 +(1 &lt;&lt; 2)) (black)
<br />
<br />When I compare with Nintendulator, I get all the same answers, except that I can't verify that it's using 0x23CC as the attribute. I double-checked that by hand, and it seems to be the right address given the pixel coordinate. My palette's also line up with Nintendulator's, so that shouldn't be the problem.
<br />
<br />Any clues what I might be doing wrong? The cute thing about this is invisible blocks always seem to get rendered as black, so they're easy to find. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />Thanks for the suggestions. I've already been buffering $2007 reads, but can you clarify what you mean by updating X scroll every scanline?

<br />For palette mirroring, I seem to have the same values as Nintendulator. I had originally followed some WRONG doc that stated you needed to mirror 0x3F00 every four bytes. I'm now following what the wiki states, which seems to be accurate so far: "$3F10/$3F14/$3F18/$3F1C are mirrors of $3F00/$3F04/$3F08/$3F0C".

Are you making sure that whenever you write to the first palette entry of any part of the palette, that it changes all the values in the first position? Because it looks like maybe the color is right in some of the places but not all of them so depending on which background color palette is used for each tile it is correct or wrong. 
<br />
<br />Maybe you are mirroring properly to the 3F00 location but when rendering you are still using 3F04,3F08,3F0C. Make sure you write all 4 locations when any of the four are written. Maybe that will fix it.

<br />
<br />You need to render with the color at $3F00 whenever the 2bpp from the tile data is 0, regardless of what the attribute bits are.

<br />Hallelujah! I didn't even need to try this to know it was the answer. I'm wondering if I just missed that or if it just isn't documented very well.

<br />For posterity's sake I'll point out that I mirror in resolveAddress (currently a hideous tangle of masks, if's and switches). So, for example, given 0x3F14 and 0x3F04, all reads and writes just go to 0x3F04. 0x3F14 is never written to or read from.

<br />You're not showing your $3ff0-3fff code. The same values don't mean correctness.
