<br />
<br />Only by some people who are too lazy to use the proper name.
<br />They're only called "kanji" if they're referring to their usage in Japanese - when referring to their usage in Chinese, they're called <strong>hanzi</strong>.
<br />
<br />That particular site seems to invent some other interesting terms, such as "Classifier" in place of the more common term "Radical", so I'd take the info on that site with a small grain of salt.

<br />The "Latin alphabet" is not called different things when referring to its usage in Icelandic, English, Italian, Vietnamese, etc. Neither is the "Cyrillic alphabet".

<br />The characters were not borrowed from modern Mandarin; they were borrowed from 5th century Chinese. If we think of Mandarin as the modern successor of 5th century Chinese, then Italian is so of Latin.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Out of curiosity, in your English dictionary (which apparently includes "kanji" but not "hanzi"/"hanja"), what is the definition given?
<br />
<br />Mine defines it as "a Japanese system of writing based on borrowed or modified Chinese characters" or "a character used in this system of writing", which sounds like it would exclude "simplified Chinese" characters (which are never used in Japanese). Then again, that's just one dictionary's definition.

Unfortunately, spelling dictionaries don't have definitions, and I don't know which full dictionary the kanjicom guy is talking about, so I can't help you further.
<br />
<br />It also depends. Are the mapper 74 games written in simplified Chinese (for PRC) or traditional Chinese (for Taiwan)? And should we be calling traditional Chinese by the pronunciation of the characters 漢字 in the Taiwanese dialect?

<br />
<br />For those that don't know, Taiwan and Hong Kong (whose people speak Cantonese/Yue), where the vast majority of "pirate originals" originated, both use Traditional Chinese characters, I think only ROM image published hacks are in simplified Chinese today.
<br />
<br />I think it's only fair to say kanji for Japanese (kunyomi) and *probably* onyomi if you're speaking in Japanese. If you're speaking English and describing vague characters which can be used in all 3 systems, there's nothing better than "Chinese characters". Of course if you're speaking English and are describing written Chinese, you should use hanzi. This way in addition to describing the specific character set you may also hint at the spoken language, except for Korean. Korea largely uses their own writing system, very distinguishable from Chinese characters. I don't think a Chinese or Japanese would be able to make sense of hanja written Korean, I believe it's a lot like kunyomi.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Nope. If the last part was unclear, I meant I believe Koreans use their hanja for Korean language natively just as Japanese have kunyomi, I'm not so sure however that Koreans have created their own hanja as Japanese have made up new kunyomi. I think hanja is interchangeable with hangul except it's used far less frequently.
