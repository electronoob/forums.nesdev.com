		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I always like to read (when I can find the time) different ways of programming since it helps you think differently when approaching new problems for normal programming task.
<br />
<br />Since programming an emulator is not what I would call "traditional business programming", there must be some concept or approach used that could be interesting to read or to learn from it.
<br />
<br />There as been a surge of aspiring emulator authors these days and it got me in the mood to read some code related to this but with no intention to built an emulator myself (no time for that).  Any specific emulator code that would make and interesting read? I want to see approach done procedurally or in OO, if that's can be applied for this (but cannot see how yet, one of the many reason I want to read some code).

<br />Little bit off-topic here: I tried your emu and it eats 100% CPU when running (50% on dual core of course). You probably want to look in to that. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Some game programming libraries spin-wait for vertical blank instead of releasing the CPU.

<br />
<br />For Nestopia, I did a quick peek in the code and it's quite overwhelming at first.  I don't really know C++ but know some other language that use OOP and the sheer amount of files inside makes it hard to check were to start. 
<br />
<br />The code is well write for the form but there seems to be no comment at all inside the code, just in the header files. But the no comments part seems very common to many source I saw.
<br />
<br />@kyuusaku:
<br />
<br />I will give them a look once I can find some time.
