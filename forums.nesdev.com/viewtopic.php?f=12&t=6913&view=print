<br />Also it would be nicer doing this, compared to playing NSFs because you can build an SNES version of the actual music engine and retool things a lot easier.  Then the only thing to do is copy the NES register contents (kept in RAM) over to the SPC.

<br />The NES already had one of those; <a href="http://www.killerreviews.com/forums/entry.php?47-Super-Mario-Bros-Alice-In-Wonderland-and-Hallucinogenic-Mushrooms" class="postlink">it was called Super Mario Bros.</a> But I'm not putting the idea down; a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" class="postlink">gender flip</a> is <a href="http://whatport80.com/A_Cat_Is_Fine_Too" class="postlink">fine too</a>.
<br />
<br />One word of advice: Don't make the levels too linear, or you might end up making a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSidepathsNoExplorationNoFreedom" class="postlink">game on rails</a> that could be confused for <a href="http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=alice+in+wonderland+video+game&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;cid=9819700887128063502&amp;ei=ohZ7TMuSGtOfnQff86idCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=product_catalog_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDYQ8wIwBA#" class="postlink">a Disney Interactive game</a> or <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/snes/action/pinocchio/index.html" class="postlink">two</a>. Even SMB1, with the linear constraints of the level data format and early scrolling engine (before the technique of mixing $2005 and $2006 writes was discovered), had pipes and vines.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, you have a project to create a SNES platformer, and have people of NESdev collaborate on a little everything in the game ?
<br />The idea sounds very good, however it will require quite some organization.
<br />
<br />I don't want to be pessimistic, but <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4551&amp;start=0" class="postlink">at least a previous attempt at a collaborative NESdev game</a> has gone to a deadend.
<br />
<br />That being said, it sounds like a cool project. Trance 2A03 + N106 music on the SNES ? Sounds cool, but what exacly do you mean by this ? The use of basic BRR samples to make cool music ? Would definitely be great innovation.
<br />However I think it should be properly programmed in SPC. Membler's emulator is just an emulator - it would likely draw a lot of performance in a game - and I'll mention the problem that everything sound terribly lowpass filtered.
<br />
<br />Will there be only one playable character (that ponytail girl) or will be multiple character, her being the principal one ?

<br />
<br />Not any more than it would on the NES. The music driver can be executed natively on the S-CPU as long as some RAM has been set aside for it. Then you'd have to send the updated APU register values to the S-SMP (i.e. 24 bytes per frame) and let it do the rest.

<br />
<br />main.asm is kind of a mess, but I guess most of the stuff in there you won't need at all.  The SPC stuff is in spc.asm.  I don't know how much SPC memory got used, but I doubt it's much so there should be plenty of room for more samples.  Let me know if you have any questions about WTF is going on in the source there.
