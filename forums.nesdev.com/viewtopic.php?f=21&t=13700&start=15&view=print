I was planing to go with plain colour anyway so it does not matter.<br /><br />The second problem with jumping is that it greatly increase the height of the plain colour band, and as such, greatly reduce the heigth of arena graphics (no matter if they're top or bottom). Let's say if a fighter is 10 tiles heigh and don't jump, and the status bar is 4 tiles high, and that we can't use the top/bottom 2 tiles because of overscan.<br /><br />Then the amount of tiles for arena is : 30 - 2 - 4 - 10 = 14 tiles<br /><br />But now if we have the character jump it's own heigth, then 20 tiles should be reserved for the character alone.<br /><br />The arena's heigth becomes : 30 - 2 - 4 - 20 = 4 tiles.<br /><br />Obviously that's a <strong>major </strong>problem. Basically the screen will be a narrow status bar, a narrow arena, and a huge blank area. Not very good looking.<br /><br />The only real solution is limit the height of the jump to much less than a character's own height. Or have smaller characters. Or a mix of both.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I wouldn't sweat the extra scroll split at all.

I don't know if MMC3 will be necessary, if it is, then having a bottom area for arena graphics is doable, except for the screen space problem I mentioned above.<br /><br />Since screen space will be so limited anyway, I thought I could just as well get rid of the bottom arena part, and have a few sprites doing the job of filling the very bottom of the screen. Especially considering the sprite fighter character will take only about 25 of the 64 available sprites (using 8x16 sprites).

I know it's going to limit the size of the character but I feel like the overall game might be limited less. Let's say you use all 64 sprites on the characters and somebody throws a haduken. Well, you could just render the haduken every other frame. Being that it's translucent, the flicker won't even look bad. Then you could set it up so that just the low priority sprites of the fighters flicker out, leaving the ones to define the shape. The characters would probably have to end up being smaller than a traditional fighter, but it's a trade-off.<br /><br />Something else that I feel is worth considering is the two button limitation. This is just my opinion, but I don't think anybody's ever going to be able to, for example, recreate the experience of Street Fighter II on the NES. If nothing else, the lack of buttons is really going to hinder that. So, just to throw it out there, I feel like an NES fighter needs something unique in the gameplay department. I'm not saying something complex, quite the opposite. A unique gameplay mechanic that is simplified enough to be really fun on the NES. Something that makes playing this fighting game different from any other for reasons other than just being on a lower powered system.

It would limit the technical challenge, and such, loose my personal interest for such a project.<br /><br />This would basically limit sprites to 4 tiles horizontally for the typical, not much smaller to what I have proposed.<br /><br />However the worst case has to be considered, and that is the case where both fighters lie on the ground, so their whole body lies horizontally. We could design the game so that's impossible, so only one fighter can be knocked out simultaneously. Then, we can imagine that the standing fighter is 3 tiles wide and 6 tiles high, while the knocked-out fighter is 6 tiles wide and 3 tiles high. There would be a little flickering, and the characters would be only 6x3 tiles.<br /><br />With my sprite/BG scheme, the lying character on the ground can take all 8 sprites for himself, and such the heigth limit is 8 tiles (so all what I said before about a heigth of 10 tiles is completely wrong, as I had forgotten  that detail).<br /><br />In order to keep the traditional 1:2 ratio, thet would make the characters 4x8 tiles when standing, and it's probably why I only used this size in the demo, even though it supports more.<br /><br />Annother approach would be to store the tiles for the knocked out character twice in the ROM (for both directions), and alternate the BG/sprite character on the fly, so that whether a character is knocked out, he becomes rendered by BG, and the standing one is rendered by a sprite. This also forbid a situation where both fighters are knocked out simultaneously, unless flickering becomes acceptable in this rare case. Anyway, this is required only if larger characters are desirable, and because of the vertical screen space problem we don't know if they are.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Let's say you use all 64 sprites on the characters and somebody throws a haduken.</div><br />As much as I love this move, it would be an obvious copyright infringement, so I wouldn't use anything like that in any game I'd ever program.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Something else that I feel is worth considering is the two button limitation.

I don't know how a game could be so unique though, fighter games are in general only interesting because of their characters, and still...<br /><br />I guess having such large &quot;sprites&quot; on the NES would be unique by itself, but if you forget the &quot;on the NES&quot; part then you get a very bland, generic and uninteresting game that is less fun than Street Fighter, and that lacks hadokens as well as any interesting moves. If jumps aren't allowed then it becomes even flatter/blander.<br /><br />EDIT : Yet another solution to the &quot;knocked out&quot; problem would be to completely change the approach: Instead of having the character knocked out lying horizontally like you'd traditionally except, we could make he lying vertically, so that he would be positioned along the Z axis. It would look strange, but maybe if the art is good this could work great, and get rid of all the issues I mentioned about rendering knocked out characters. Or, even simpler, make a fighting game where characters aren't knocked out during the fight, and are only &quot;dizzy&quot; no matter what happen.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just had an idea, what do you think of this:<br /><br />It kind of goes along with the thought of shifting some parts of the sprites into the background.<br /><br />What if the characters were sprites, and then instead of flickering sprites when a scanline holds more than eight, actively combine the sprites with the background tiles and update to CHR-RAM.<br /><br />If that engine could be devised, I think that might be the ultimate option. Then you could have as detailed of a background as you want and not have to store left and right facing tiles of your characters. CHR would end up becoming the limiting factor on making a game from this engine.<br /><br />Just brainstorming, the idea may be a little challenging but I think it's doable. If we don't scroll and essentially do nothing else but play music in NMI, we could even blank out a little on the top and have plenty of time to upload tiles. Like I said before, I bet calculating the collisions and damage stats will leave enough headroom to potentially prepare the tile updates.<br /><br />Drawing a tile, the program would need to analyze the sprite and replace any pixel which is color zero with the color of the BG tile underneath. The characters would most likely have to be stored in CHR to the shape of their animation, so they can be referenced and combined with a BG tile offset by X-Y position.<br /><br />We'd also have to switch CHR banks in NMI. That's quick.<br /><br />I'd say go with vertical mirroring so we can have a two screen width without having to write to nametables. Then we could slightly expand the vertical screen when characters jump by vertically spreading BG layers on scanline IRQs.<br /><br />What do you think of any of these ideas?

Even if we limit to 2 colums (that would work, but not allow any other sprites, as each character would use 4 tiles) we'd have to rewrite at least 24 tiles, and that's still too much.<br /><br />I didn't even approach the huge problem it's going to be with palettes, but it seem like a poor idea overall. Either using only sprites or using one character sprite + one character BG are the most sensible solutions.
