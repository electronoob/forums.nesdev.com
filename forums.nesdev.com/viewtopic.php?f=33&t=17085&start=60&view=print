[For anything to be generally percieved a remake], I do think there should be a substantial similarity, if not in body, then at least in theme or spirit. At the same time, the comparison seems unfair. Monkey island is a grand adventure that will keep you invested for hours and a simple cameo would pale in comparison. <em>Starevil</em> will likely have have you throw the controller on the side of the sofa before the first level is even done. There's nothing of significant value in it; it's all noisy mush in absence of active design. The other two levels don't offer anything different. Game breaks at 4th. Takes you a couple of minutes to get there. The most significant feature is the cheap trick in the beginning. New star evil captures that moment. The rest of the game captures the noisy mush in a symbolic parallelism. I dare say new star evil manages to capture what starevil is about (at least on a spiritual level) if not in full then at least by half.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">When this is entirely an argument about expectations</div><br />This is the core of the disagreement. I think it's clear that not everyone would subscribe to this framing of the subject. There's plenty of other frames in here, too.

Everyone makes poor decisions occasionally, everyone can be a dick sometimes, the important thing is to not do it intentionally and consistently enough that you're bothering people all the time.<br /><br />I say this in the most generic way possible, because I honestly haven't been following this thread for the past few pages, so I don't know how far the drama went for something that really isn't supposed to be such a big deal.<br /><br />If we're still discussing wether a deceptive game description is allowed in the compo cartridge, my vote is to let the author of the game do whatever he wants. If he feels that this is important to get players in the right mood to make the most out of the game, then that's just part of the experience of playing that game. A compilation cartridge is hardly an encyclopedia that has a strict commitment with the truth, and not everyone is required to like all of the games. If a player is sensitive enough to feel betrayed by an NES game then HE/SHE needs to work on that, because any normal person would simply avoid the game in the future.

The thing that upsets me is that <em>in my opinion</em>, the menu should appear to be a neutral arbiter, and <em>because</em> to me &quot;remake&quot; implies things that this isn't, and that in turn negatively affects the appearance of neutrality of the menu.
