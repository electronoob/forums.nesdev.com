<br />
<br />But found that the wiki suffers from the exact same problem that Loopy's original document does: lack of definition of what each variable represents.  The irony is in the fact that at the top of the Wiki it references that exact problem, but (from what I can see) does very little to address that problem.
<br />
<br />I would like to see the following variables explained/defined:
<br />
<br />d
<br />A
<br />B
<br />C
<br />D
<br />E
<br />F
<br />G
<br />H
<br />X
<br />
<br />I'm left with the impression that A through H are just letter placeholders for specific VRAM address bits, but without an explanation it's literally impossible to tell.  I can't even begin to fathom what X is.
<br />
<br />I'm not the only one who after 10+ years still finds this document completely and entirely indecipherable.  :-)
<br />
<br />I'd love if someone could really write this thing up into a coherent step-by-step (read: verbose) guide, since there are a multitude of games that (obviously) rely on this behaviour, so emulating it wrong results in hard-to-discern breakage (e.g. in some games but not others).
<br />
<br />P.S. -- And yeah, I'm aware of this, which is much more helpful but at a different level: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_scrolling">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_scrolling</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />EDIT: After reading the 2nd URL (PPU_scrolling), it's a little more clear, but not entirely.  It seems to me these two pages should probably be re-written and merged into one well-written page.  Given my history with documentation I'd be happy to do this except I do not understand how it works, hence my post here.  :-)

<br />
<br />It turns "X" into "H", but then within the PPU registers section of the document, "x" (note that it's lowercase, yet in the main part of the document something was referred to as "X" (capital)) is still labelled as "fine X scroll (3 bits)" even though I don't see any visual indication of something controlling 3 bits.
<br />
<br />Yep, still confusing.  Hehe :D
<br />
<br />EDIT: Oh, I see.  For the 1st $2005 write:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">t:........ ...HGFED = d:HGFED...<br />x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= d:.....CBA<br /></div>
<br />Okay, so that explains what "x" is, and its 3 bits.  However, now "x" isn't used anywhere further below that.
<br />
<br />I think the formatting of all of these variables could really be improved in some way, probably if the entire thing was turned into a table and then each variable (t, v, x, and d) were given their own columns, along with a description column, thus every row would indicate what was written and which of the 8-bits of d went into what.  I'll edit a sandbox page and see how it looks.

Fine X scroll is the select value of an 8-way mux on the output stage. The only thing that changes fine X scroll is the first write to $2005. When you write to $2005, the change to fine X scroll takes effect <em>immediately</em>, as of the next pixel. The rest of the write doesn't take effect until the end of the scanline.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I think the formatting of all of these variables could really be improved in some way, probably if the entire thing was turned into a table and then each variable (t, v, x, and d) were given their own columns</div>

<br />
<br />An example like, here is a game with a status bar at the top, the player has just started playing and has triggered the first pixel of horizontal movement.  Timed code has gotten us to this point, here are several variables and exactly what they contain, and here is a routine showing how to scroll 1 pixel over.
<br />
<br />I realize it's important to understand the underpinnings, but some people learn better this way.
<br />
<br />EDIT: On further review, tokumaru's code and the rest of the links (Shiru's vertical scroll question) are already very educational, but again, literally showing values being written and when to write them can also be informative.

<br />I provided a table-ised version (which IMHO is easier to read, especially given the formatting I did on it), and an example showing what v/t/x bits get changed.  I'm not sure if Wiki syntax allows it, but I could probably colour-code the individual bits from the opcode which gets "transferred" into the t variable are a certain colour thus easier to read when looking at the "Instructions" vs. "After" columns.

<br />Bare minimum, I think the Examples section would be worthwhile keeping.  Though the preceding table-ised version of the ASCII diagram took me a while to do, I'm fine with giving it up.

<br />I would also strongly advise that someone make an Example for <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=78593#78593" class="postlink">this insanity</a> (taken from PPU Scrolling) because that's one I STILL do not get/understand.

<br />That is just the order in which you have to write to the registers (and how the bits you write are supposed to be arranged) to fully reset the scroll mid-screen, considering all the rules loopy has detailed in his document.

<br />
<br />Writing an address via $2006, simply, makes the adressed tile visible on the left of the next scanline.
<br />The only tricky part is about the highest 4 bits - they are ignored (or you could say "hardwired to $2xxx", and instead the highest bits are used for fine Y scroll.
<br />To adress fine X scroll you'll have to ressort to using $2005, as usual.

<br />Looks correct. I see no reason to write anything other than the NT index on the first write though, since everything else gets overwritten. Is your purpose to show that bits do get overwritten?
