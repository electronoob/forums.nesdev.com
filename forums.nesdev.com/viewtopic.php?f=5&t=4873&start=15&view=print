<br />
<br />It's also possible to dive into assembly with really no knowledge about programming, like I did. If people are determined enough (like I was), they can learn with absolutely no prior programming experience. But it was a really rocky start, I have to admit.

<br />I mean, going from english to assembly can be a bit to harsh, while english -&gt; high level language -&gt; assembly might be easier to do, because the middle step serves as a sort of connector. At the same time the person is learning how to tell a computer what to do with simple english-like structures, they are learning about programming concepts that will be useful at a lower level.
<br />
<br />I never said that diving directly into assembly was impossible, though. People like you and Memblers have proved this is possible. I just think it can be harder (not that it will be so for everyone).

<br />
<br />Oh, this is really true. When I learned a little of QBasic, I was shocked at how straightforward everything was. Like you could just say Print "Blah Blah"
<br />and it would do exactly that. I was used to the old load-and-store loop which was a lot less intuitive I guess than higher level languages are.
<br />
<br />That's QBasic though. C for some reason is a bit harder for me to understand. Just the syntax is weird to me (e.g. "^" is a symbol for either AND,OR, or XOR, while it honestly should be "to the power of". I still don't know how to say "to the power of" in C without doing X*X*X....). And there are terms that I guess I just need to sit down and really figure out what they mean.

<br />I think there is no operator for it, but there is a "pow()" function to do that.

Early on in my job, I wrote what my boss thought was pseudocode. I double-clicked it, and he was surprised when it actually ran. It was Python.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">there is a "pow()" function </div>
<br />That's fine for floats. If you need one for ints, you can roll your own function to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring" class="postlink">square and multiply</a>, and then just stick it in your personal library.
<br />
<br />Thanks Fx3 for suggesting a split point.
