<br />
<br />Does anyone know where I can find detailed information about the physical form-factor of a NES cart's housing?
<br />
<br />I would like to make an improved design that protects the label art, but I can't find any specifications from which to build a part model.
<br />
<br />I no longer own a NES, and as such, no longer own any NES carts, so I can't just dig out a pair of calipers, like I normally would in this predicament.
<br />
<br />I know that screw locations, cartridge length/width/thickness, and the shape of the card edge port are all non-trivial, and need to be done right; are there any publicly available technical drawings or spec sheets I can draw from?

Most of the problem with NES carts was that the labels were just colored glossy paper, which gets eroded over time, and the cart ends up looking like it has leprosy.  Making the cart design a little different by insetting the label area 1.5mm, and then shimming the space with clear plastic, or clear epoxy would protect the labels, and make the cartridge art much more durable.</div>
<br />
<br />i'm pretty sure they were done using a thin gloss laminate. there's plenty of NES carts out there with perfect labels that look like they just came from the factory, it's just a matter of taking care of them (as with anything).

<br />
<br />the problem manifests when storing the carts on a shelf that is tightly packed, like storing hard cover books. (the problem is lessened by using the plastic dust sleeves, but those are hard to find these days, short of a trip to a flea market.) This causes the paper to get "scratched" as the carts are rubbed against each other, resulting in the "Leprosy" look. (then there is always the issue with smokers in the house... I am fairly sure that retrobrite would be bad news on the paper labels.)
<br />
<br />The whole issue would have been easily corrected by reducing the depth of the label area 1mm, then filling the space with a clear plastic insert after the label was put on.  Granted, then the clear plastic window would get scratched up, but that is replaceable. The label is not.

<br />
<br />NTSC or PAL? i've very sure that the NTSC SMB2 has the nice gloss label that every other cart had. i don't think i've ever seen any sort of 'paper' label on a NES cart (maybe on unlicensed games though). not sure what the 'leprosy' look is either.
<br />
<br />(ehh... i guess we've veered quite a bit off-topic with this. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> )

<br />
<br />It just means that it has a coating applied to the paper.  As for the "Leprosy" look, let me find a picture of such a label...
<br />
<br />*edit
<br />
<br />Damn people refusing to own up to having marred carts.  I can't find any except for "Extreme" cases, like where somebody tried to peel a label off. 
<br />
<br />The "leprosy" look is best imagined as to what would happen if you attacked the label with 500 grit sandpaper, and partially sanded through the color layer. (small islands of discoloration where the paper texture of the label has created raised areas that got ablated by friction.) The result is a sort of "Patchy" appearance to the sticker, and a loss of gloss.
<br />
<br />This weekend I will visit the flea market and bring my camera. (Wichita has Kansas's Larges flea market in it. It is only open on weekends though. There are at least 3 used games dealers that are regularly there.)
<br />
<br /> I'll look for some lepritic carts then. (probably buy one for up-close examination. It seems that the detailed physical information about NES carts and cartridge system boards is dead-linked in the wiki to a dead go-daddy domain. Means the information needs to be re-created. Since I am the one asking, I might as well...)
<br />
<br />In the meantime, yes-- we did derail.  (sorry everyone.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What I've used is this roll of extremely thin label-protection protection tape.  I bought it a while back off someone who was using it to make NES cart labels, I forget who.  It's thicker than what the original labels used, but from looking at it I think it's the exact same stuff.  It's polypropylene, uv resistant, and has an acid-free adhesive.  The thickness makes it look a little more shiny, but I think it would be a little more durable maybe.  It's not the easiest stuff to work with, but it looks cool.  <a href="http://www.parodius.com/~memblers/nes/squeedo/pics/testlabel-angle.jpg" class="postlink">http://www.parodius.com/~memblers/nes/squeedo/pics/testlabel-angle.jpg</a>  Of course the paper underneath is matte (and inkjet, but I think this stuff protects it enough from water if you use a safe adhesive).
<br />
<br />I know somewhere recently there was a drawing made of the NES cart board dimensions.  I thought it got put in the wiki.
<br />
<br />edit: well it was on the wiki, but the links are dead. <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_cartridge_dimensions" class="postlink">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_cartridge_dimensions</a>
