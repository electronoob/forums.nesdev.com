		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There's a distinct difference between selling poorly designed cartridges that may very well damage consoles of unknowing buyers, and doing whatever you want with your own property.<br /><br />That said, wide spread conversion/destruction of hardware that's no longer in production can and does affect others by means of prices.  Depending on your perspective that affect on price can be good, bad, or moot, but you can't easily deny it's existence.

I doubt Nintendo really has any reason to care about it (considering they don't even seem to care about people mass-producing repro carts of games that they <em>don't</em> own the rights to...)
