<br />I have not downloaded pictures from my camera to my server yet.  But I didn't take many.  Marshall took some picts.
<br />
<br />A few people played your <em>boom</em> game.  Lots of people liked Shiru's <em>LAN Master</em>.  Other games that got lots of play time were  <em>Pogo Cats</em> and <em>Mine Shaft</em>.  <em>Assimilate</em> was also a crowd favorite.  Gotta love a game with an anal probe weapon.
<br />
<br />I met the one of the two guys (Marty) that created the original <em>Atari Flashback</em>, where they ported a dozen or so Atari 2600 titles to a NOAC.
<br />
<br />Last year I saw an Apple /// in the computer history museum exhibit.  I also own an Apple ///, but mine would not power on.  So this year I brought mine in with hopes of having the computer history guys take a look at it.  Mike Lee (owns the other Apple ///) made some SOS disk images for me.  Near the end of Saturday evening I went home to take care of a few things and then returned.  When I got back, Memblers and a few others had "did-membled" my Apple /// trying to figure out why it would not boot.  We reseated all of the daughter cards, took lots of photos and re-assembled it.  That damn thing booted up!  Awesome.  So that was cool.  It was kind of funny to hook my 1981 Apple /// up to a 2011 LCD TV (composite video) as a monitor.
<br />
<br />Rizz demoed <em>Armed for Battle</em> which is coming along nicely.
<br />
<br />I picked up some more Atari 2600 carts for my collection (almost 300 unique titles and growing).
<br />
<br />big_jt wore a coconut bra.
