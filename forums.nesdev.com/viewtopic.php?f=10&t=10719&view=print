		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello.  As you can see I am new here.  I have a little experience with programming on NES.  I have been able to get an animated sprite on the screen that can move and jump using controller input; the basic stuff you all understand.  One thing I was wondering how todo is flip the sprite when I press left (the sprites I created are oriented to the right) without having to make a completely new sprite and - as a result - waste graphic space.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If your character is wider than 8 pixels, you'll have to worry about more than just the flip bits in the attribute byte though. Typically games make use of meta-sprites (group of hardware sprites that form a larger object), and the meta-sprite system is responsible for reading the sprite definitions and rendering them to OAM taking into consideration the object's position and direction.<br /><br />Some people would rather avoid the complexity (and slowness) of a routine that automatically flips sprites and define redundant meta-sprites for all directions a character/object can face.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You have to turn the X coordinate increment into a variable, like tepples said (i.e. to move to the next column of sprites you either add 8 or subtract 8, depending on whether the object is flipped), but you have also to adjust the initial coordinate, so that if the first sprite's X coordinate would be at 231 when not flipped, it would be at 231 + (ObjectWidth - 8) when flipped.<br /><br />I hope you are not using hardcoded OAM locations for your sprites and updating the coordinates of each individual sprites as your character moves, because that makes things much harder. The correct/versatile way to draw sprites is to start from the object's logical coordinate (the one you use for movement, collisions, etc.) and draw all individual sprites around that, to dynamic OAM positions (which also allows you to do sprite cycling when you need it). As long as you do it the versatile way, it's just a matter of calculating the first X coordinate and the step value based on the direction the object is facing, and use those in the loop that renders sprites.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle">Dimeback wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I am not sure what &quot;hardcoded&quot; OAM is.</div><br />Hardcoding an object to OAM locations would be to always have the same object use the same OAM slots. The OAM can hold 64 sprites, if your character is 16x32 pixels large (meaning it needs 8 8x8 sprites) and you always use $0200-$021F (assuming your OAM buffer is at $0200, like in most programs), that would be hardcoding sprites. This is bad because the same characters will always be displayed with the same priority, so if you line up a number of characters that adds up to more than 8 sprites, the ones with lower priority will disappear. This problem is solved by drawing the characters to different OAM slots every frame (meaning you can't hardcode them), so that their priorities cycle and you end up with flicker instead of invisible sprites.
