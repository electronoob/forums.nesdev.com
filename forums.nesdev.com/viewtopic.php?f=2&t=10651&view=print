		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As far as I know, both the NTSC and PAL NESes use the same 9VAC input. It seems to me that finding a new 120V-to-9V adapter is probably easier (and likely cheaper?) than buying a 120V-to-240V adapter.<br /><br />I'm a little wary of the one you were given being only rated for 400mA, though; ISTR that's very close to what the NES consumes at minimum. If you do buy a new one, I think I've heard the general consensus be &quot;at least 7V, at most 13V, and at least 3/4 A&quot;, and, due to how the NES works, you're most likely safe with either AC or DC.<br /><br />(Koitsu: ungrounded AC adapters don't have a polarity.)<br /><br />Tangentially, what are you using to display the PAL image it'll produce?

I didn't check if that will fit, it looked like it did. I read that you can do that but it was not from a reliable site like this.<br /><br />I guess the safest option is to buy a UK NES Adapter on ebay (official) and then pick up that 100w converter? Unless my US Adapter will work but I am not trying it unless someone knows for sure.<br /><br />I wound up buying a Vizio TV for my room, and it supports 576i/p 25fps. I didn't buy it for that reason but noticed my PAL DVDs were playing correctly which was hard since I had it upscaled to 1080p but it is fully PAL compatible and good price. I know it's strange as my big TV refuses to support PAL: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009IBXEE6/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009IB ...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The US NES adapter (120VAC-&gt;1.3A@9VAC) should be just fine. I remember people mentioning they've done whole-brain swaps of PAL and NTSC NESes (swapping crystal, PPU, CPU, and CIC) and had it work fine, so the adapter should be completely compatible too.<br /><br />In any case, if it asks for 9VAC at 850mA, then any power supply rated for 9VAC at roughly that amount of current will be fine.<br /><br />(Regarding the vizio TV thing: I was kinda surprised when I discovered that my Acer LCD computer monitors support 240p/60 and 288p/50. In fact, the latter is the only 50Hz mode it can parse.)

(Asterix anyone?) And a developer might want to test on a 50 Hz console in order to make a game that adapts its music and game speed to 50 Hz as Codemasters games do.

I have the &quot;NES&quot; version made by Mattel. Yes the output is correct: AC9v 1.3A and if I modded it would run fine, but I wound up ordering an UK power supply instead.<br /><br />As far as why I wanted one is that PAL games run to fast on NTSC console, and there are a handful (not many) that are exclusive, but buying a PAL NES is certainly not for everyone and not for most games as they are NTSC. Offhand I can name only two, Smurfs and Mario Bros Classic lol<br /><br />Yes I recommend the Vizio for anyone who wants both NTSC/PAL compatibility.

I think same is with LCD TVs manufactured by international corporations (it is cheaper to make TV that support all kinds of signal and ship it than to make one TV for one &quot;region&quot;). If it wouldn't switch automatically, you should be able to do it in menu of TV.
