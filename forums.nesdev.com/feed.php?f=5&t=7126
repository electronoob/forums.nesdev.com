Seems like I remember in the Game Genie codebook, there were some codes for games that would give more lives / other stuff to a specific player.  I believe it had a 'handicap' icon or something similar, for those types of codes. (which could be codes that give you LESS lives, always wondered how many people used those, heheh)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Nov 05, 2010 3:55 pm</p><hr />

Super Mario Galaxy for Wii has such a "Co-Star mode": player 2 can shoot candy at enemies with the Wii Remote. I'd like to see a hack of SMB1 to freeze bad guys by shooting coins at enemies with the Zapper.

I didn't know where else to post this. There are numerous simultaneous, cooperative 2 player games for the NES that I like to play with my wife sometimes, but usually she will quickly tire of these because of difficulty. Does anyone know of any rom hacks out there that make the second player invincible or take significantly more damage (in games in which this applies)? If not, I think I finally have motivation to do a simple rom hack of my own.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Thu Nov 04, 2010 7:19 pm</p><hr />
