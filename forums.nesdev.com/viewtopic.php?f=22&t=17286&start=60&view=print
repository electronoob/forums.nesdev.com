This happens directly after the NMI returns:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;00:9BB8: 20 C0 E3&nbsp; JSR $E3C0 ; wait for NMI<br />&gt;00:9BBB: A9 01&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA #$01 ; setup first interrupt<br />&nbsp;00:9BBD: 8D 00 E0&nbsp; STA $E000<br />&nbsp;00:9BC0: 8D 00 C0&nbsp; STA $C000<br />&nbsp;00:9BC3: A9 00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA #$00<br />&nbsp;00:9BC5: 8D 01 C0&nbsp; STA $C001<br />&nbsp;00:9BC8: A9 01&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA #$01<br />&nbsp;00:9BCA: 8D 01 E0&nbsp; STA $E001<br />&nbsp;00:9BCD: A9 00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA #$00<br />&nbsp;00:9BCF: 85 74&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;STA $74</div><br /><br />The problem is that the music routine delays when you will return from NMI. On PAL there is plenty of time for it to execute before rendering begins, but on NTSC it will overlap the beginning of the frame sometimes. If this first IRQ setup doesn't happen before scanline 0, the whole screen is thrown off. (Seems to be about 10-15 scanlines late on every other frame.)<br /><br />The solution should be to put this inside your NMI handler. See my last suggestion from my previous post, you should still add that CLI and RTI, but right there above the suggested CLI do this first IRQ setup right there, when you know you're still in vblank (i.e. before scanline 0) and you haven't yet run the music routine. This will allow that first IRQ to fire on scanline 0 (which will sometimes be within the music routine, but it is perfectly okay to interrupt that).<br /><br /><br />Alternative option is to put the music playback call in your main thread just after that STA $74. This will get your NMI handler returning earlier again.<br /><br />Ideally both of these things should be within the NMI, though. Having the IRQs set off by the NMI will prevent them from failling if your main thread ever runs too long (slowdown), and similar with music having it in the NMI makes it slowdown resitant. However, if you can guarantee the main thread will never run long it doesn't matter either way.

So if your music update happens in your NMI routine, it will overlap and block your interrupts if it takes too long, which it does on NTSC.<br /><br />Easy fix: just put a CLI in the NMI routine just before it calls the music playback (assuming it is the last thing that happens in your NMI handler). Otherwise if that's not feasible, you can just move the music playback outside of the NMI. It doesn't really matter too much where it gets called as long as it's once per frame, preferably at a consistent time (which is why NMI is usually convenient).<br /><br /><br />Edit: Actually, peeking at it in a debugger, it looks like your NMI is missing an RTI at the end? It seems to roll right into the IRQ handler after finishing. So in this case, I'd recommend putting a CLI before the music playback there, and also an RTI before the IRQ handler begins.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;03:E224: A9 00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA #$00<br />&nbsp;03:E226: 85 02&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;STA $02 = #$03<br />&nbsp;03:E228: 20 4C E8&nbsp; JSR $E84C ; music playback? place a CLI right before this line<br />&nbsp;03:E22B: 68&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PLA<br />&nbsp;03:E22C: A8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TAY<br />&nbsp;03:E22D: 68&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PLA<br />&nbsp;03:E22E: AA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TAX<br />&nbsp;03:E22F: 68&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PLA ; shouldn't an RTI follow this line?<br />&gt;03:E230: 48&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PHA ; IRQ handler starts here<br />&nbsp;03:E231: 8A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TXA<br />&nbsp;03:E232: 48&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PHA<br />&nbsp;03:E233: 98&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TYA<br />&nbsp;03:E234: 48&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PHA<br />...<br />&nbsp;03:E260: 40&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RTI</div></div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Ah, I see the problem.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, there are three things:<br /><br />1. Put the IRQ setup in your NMI handler before <strong>jsr FamitomeUpdate</strong> so that it is guaranteed to happen before the end of vblank.<br />2. Right after the IRQ setup, put <strong>cli</strong> (also before <strong>jsr FamitoneUpdate</strong>) so that if an IRQ happens during the music routine it won't be blocked.<br />3. Put <strong>rti</strong> on the end of your NMI handler (after that ...<strong>tax, pla</strong>). Without this, the code just keeps running into the IRQ handler directly below.<br /><br />The main thing I'm not entirely certain of, without looking at much more of the code, is whether it's appropriate to set up the IRQ <em>every</em> NMI or just on screens that need it. Maybe it should have a flag that turns it on and off? (When I say IRQ setup I mean that code including lines $9BBB to $9BCF in that disassembly.)<br /><br />As an alternative, just as a quick test, you could just take <strong>jsr FamitomeUpdate</strong> and move it just under the IRQ setup where it is right now. (Just after where it stores a #0 to your IRQ counter variable at $74.) That would also solve the problem you're having that this music update is happening <em>before</em> you've prepared your IRQs to fire. I wouldn't recommend this as a permanent solution, though, because it's usually appropriate to do music in the NMI handler. If it's not in the NMI handler, music will tend to skip during scene transitions, and also you would need to manually call <strong>jsr FamitoneUpdate</strong> in <em>each</em> main thread frame loop if there are more than one.

Leaving this extra $74 = 0 in there causes the splits to start over in the middle of the screen.<br /><br />Doesn't cause a problem in PAL or without music on NTSC because if NMI finishes before vblank it hasn't run any IRQs yet (resets 0 back to 0). Once you add music in, some IRQs will happen before the music is finished, and this reset ends up mid-screen.<br /><br />(If I replace that STA $74 with two NOPs it seems to run as correctly as the other modes.)<br /><br /><br />Edit: Oh, you called $74 <strong>_Scroll_Index</strong> in your IRQ code, you should use that at <strong>@skipNtsc</strong> too just in case the variable ever moves.

You can see the problem using Mesen, but it appears the same way on my PowerPak (i.e. the character sprite and moon sprite are using the wrong tiles). This isn't NTSC / PAL related, it is only about fully initializing the MMC3 (would look the same on PAL PowerPak/Mesen).<br /><br />Of the 8 bank settings on the MMC3 (selected through $8000) I see setup for: 0, 1, 6, 7 (PPU first page, and CPU banks). You are missing any setup for 2, 3, 4, 5 (PPU second page, i.e. all your sprites).<br /><br />Some emulators, and apparently the Everdrive, pre-initialize these with default values, but on the real MMC3 these are &quot;random&quot; when powered on. (You can see what <a href="https://github.com/TASVideos/fceux/blob/5be92d3ee50fcdc04ec4d727cef5201fa8fba378/src/boards/mmc3.cpp#L107" class="postlink">FCEUX uses instead of randomness</a>, for example. This seems to be a common setup pattern for emulators, Everdrive must have borrowed it.)<br /><br />Anyhow, really easy to fix, just send 4,5,6,7 to the uninitialized banks 2,3,4,5 in your startup code:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda #2<br />sta $8000<br />lda #4<br />sta $8001<br />lda #3<br />sta $8000<br />lda #5<br />sta $8001<br />lda #4<br />sta $8000<br />lda #6<br />sta $8001<br />lda #5<br />sta $8000<br />lda #7<br />sta $8001</div>

You can see the problem using Mesen, but it appears the same way on my PowerPak (i.e. the character sprite and moon sprite are using the wrong tiles). This isn't NTSC / PAL related, it is only about fully initializing the MMC3 (would look the same on PAL PowerPak/Mesen).<br /><br />Of the 8 bank settings on the MMC3 (selected through $8000) I see setup for: 0, 1, 6, 7 (PPU first page, and CPU banks). You are missing any setup for 2, 3, 4, 5 (PPU second page, i.e. all your sprites).<br /><br />Some emulators, and apparently the Everdrive, pre-initialize these with default values, but on the real MMC3 these are &quot;random&quot; when powered on. (You can see what <a href="https://github.com/TASVideos/fceux/blob/5be92d3ee50fcdc04ec4d727cef5201fa8fba378/src/boards/mmc3.cpp#L107" class="postlink">FCEUX uses instead of randomness</a>, for example. This seems to be a common setup pattern for emulators, Everdrive must have borrowed it.)<br /><br />Anyhow, really easy to fix, just send 4,5,6,7 to the uninitialized banks 2,3,4,5 in your startup code:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda #2<br />sta $8000<br />lda #4<br />sta $8001<br />lda #3<br />sta $8000<br />lda #5<br />sta $8001<br />lda #4<br />sta $8000<br />lda #6<br />sta $8001<br />lda #5<br />sta $8000<br />lda #7<br />sta $8001</div></div><br /><br />I have not understood what this really does, but I have tried to fix it.<br /><br />Is it right now?

The only emulator that seems to fail with it now is Nintendulator, but I'm not sure why that is.<br /><br />There are smaller glitches still, I'm sure you've seen, but the main stuff is working. This is good!!
