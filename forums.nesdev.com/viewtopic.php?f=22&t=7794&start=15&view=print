Not worrying about the extra channels, have you tried to see if it "locks up" with GNROM instead?  Maybe it has to do with VRC6's mapper code on the PowerPak...  Are your mapper files on your card up to date?  Do you need NTSC testers with PowerPak?

<br />I'm using the latest mappers from the retrozone website (1.34).
<br />
<br />I can't just switch VRC6 for GNROM since it doesn't use the same mapping scheme. My code relies on the fact that I can switch 16k at $8000 and 8k at $C000, and it'd be non-trivial to change that.
<br />
<br />Here's the ROM used for the latest video in case you want to try it on an NTSC console: <a href="http://jiggawatt.org/rushjet1_evilboss2.nes" class="postlink">rushjet1_evilboss2.nes</a>
<br />And here's one where the lockup is <strong>really</strong> noticeable (shortly after the intro ends): <a href="http://jiggawatt.org/tintin_vgm.nes" class="postlink">tintin_vgm.nes</a>

<br />I tested it on hardware.  It sounds exactly the same as your recording (except for my expansion channels being louder. ;P)
<br />
<br />That's good news because it seems that only the frame before NESVGM bankswitches back to the first pattern/frame/bank that it does the slight hanging as well.  It does not hang on any other frame no matter how long it loops.

<br />Edit:

<br />
<br />It skips in the VGM as well.  Not sure if you have an issue or not.
<br />
<br />I imported the VGM into MOD2PSG2 and it appears that if you look at pattern #16 that it was done purposefully.

<br />Are we talking about the same "locking up" here?

<br />Also regarding the Tintin conversion, I don't notice any sort of locking up whatsoever on my NTSC console.

<br />What's your PowerPak ROM/Card version? Mine says 1.00 / 1.34.
<br />Maybe it's a hardware issue. The weird thing is that it only happens in some songs, but it happens at the same spot in those songs all the time.

<br />Yeah, it would be nice if someone with the same PowerPak SW versions (boot ROM 1.00 and mappers 1.34) could test the tintin_vgm.nes ROM on their NES. If they don't get the problem, then at least I could rule out any software issue.

<br />A solution to this issue is that you could drop the notes' octaves by 1 to compensate and it should sound fairly accurate.
<br />
<br />Btw, do you know of a real way to pull off the 2x frequency divider for a hardware VGM player for GG/SMS?  Wouldn't the crystal have to be underclocked?  Would it be possible to lag the frequencies in the player routine?

<br />I have boot ROM 1.00 and downloaded 1.34 mappers from RetroZone website, and it worked without glitches (PAL NES).
<br />
<br />Here's a rather strange (unrelated) thing.. since I had a custom set of mappers on PowerPak prior to downloading 1.34, I renamed the directory to something like POWERPAK-custom (I also had other older versions of the mappers renamed like this) and then extracted 1.34 on the CF in POWERPAK directory... For some strange reason it was showing 1.33B1 as the version at bootup, like it was reading them from the wrong directory. I then went to add an underscore in front of all the mapper dir names and it displayed 1.34. I tried removing the underscores once again and yep, it's reading from the wrong directory again.
<br />
<br />Soo.. I guess it's only checking the first 8 characters of the filename, and uses the one which happens to come first in the file system.

<br />You could set the tone channel periods to zero to get a constant high output, and do SW-generated square waves by modifying the volume at precise intervals. But I'm sceptical about the possibility of pulling that off for 3 channels simultaneously.
