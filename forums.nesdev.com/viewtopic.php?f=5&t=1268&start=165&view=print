<br />As for MM2, nice find. I hadn't heard it was broken before. ZD says it's about 7 years old. It's probably the first rip by Scott Worley that I've ever found that actually needed to be repaired. All he forgot was to run 'Play' once before initing the song value. That inits it with Song 0, which the game does. After that, everything is identical to the original rip.

He's still got an interest in the scene, and doesn't seem too peeved about my changes to the format, but he does seem to prefer the rips being changed to work with the format, instead of the other way around.
<br />
<br />"I tested it on a few emulators and some do not play it correctly."
<br />Um...hate to break it to you, but not every GB emulator does the sound the same way. Some excel in certain areas, and fall behind in others.
<br />
<br />GBS2GB simply puts the file with the ROM-Based player. It does complicated things, but the basic operation of the .GB conversion is what you'd get by compiling it off of Scott Worley's original .ASM. I haven't seen much that would suggest the ASM file needs to be repaired in any other way, and the GBS2GB program still seems to be knocking the stuffing out of any GBS I see fit to throw at it.

<br />
<br />Here's a "fun" question for everyone.  Do you prefer NES or GB music?  I think they generally sound very similar.  A big plus for GB is the stereo capability, though not all games use it.  If you want a game that's on both systems to compare, try Duck Tales.  The sequel Duck Tales 2 is good as well.  And they are both stereo GBSs.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />One problem with stereo on Game Boy is that a channel must be panned hard left, center, or right. You can hear the limitation especially in Space Invaders when the saucer passes over the top of the screen. A lot of games, such as Super Mario Land, just pan each instrument back and forth between the channels to add gimmicky stereo. I haven't listened to DuckTales (I'm on break at work at the moment), but does it actually place each "instrument" (e.g. kick, snare, hat, horns) at a consistent position (L, C, or R) in the stereo field?

<br />
<br />
<br />It has to do with the sound inits, I'm fairly sure. The gameboy sound system sometimes makes a popping sound when certain sound features are setup for use by the game. Similar things can happen with the NES sound system. If you increase the 'Frequency' value in the NEZPlug setup file, you can decrease the effect a little. Some valid values to try:
<br />
<br />32000
<br />44100
<br />48000
<br />88200
<br />96000
<br />
<br />The best number will depend on what your sound card can handle playing back.
