		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is there any chips that are compatible with the N64 Gamepak 4K/16K EEPROMs? They seem to use only 1 data line S_DAT (doesn't specify in or out), a clock, and /reset... but most other serial eeproms have a CS, CLOCK, and a data in and out.<br /><br />And the same question is posed for the SRAM they used in games like Zelda. I'm assuming that they had some kind of latching built into the SRAM similar to the ROM to work with the multiplexed addresses, but there doesn't appear to be a pinout anywhere for that chip LH52V246A.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: Just thinking...what if some kind of AND gate was used to combine the D_IN and D_OUT on a serial EEPROM to the S_DAT pin? Would that work for a read/write function? Also, could CS be tied to /RESET on the console with an inverter to control the chip enable? If those worked, then perhaps a replacement could be possible.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the info!<br /><br />I was mainly just looking for something to tinker with during my Christmas holidays as I've got some time off of work. Wanted to see if I could increase the size of the EEPROM or the SRAM in a game without it causing issues.<br /><br />Been looking at NAND memory, and seems to have all the right pins for matching up to a Maskrom pinout. Is that what their Maskroms were using? They seem to have the same address latching function, with an ALE pin to control it (though, the Maskrom has a seperate ALE for high and low access). Something like this: <a href="http://www.spansion.com/Support/Datasheets/S34ML01G2_04G2.pdf" class="postlink">http://www.spansion.com/Support/Datasheets/S34ML01G2_04G2.pdf</a>
