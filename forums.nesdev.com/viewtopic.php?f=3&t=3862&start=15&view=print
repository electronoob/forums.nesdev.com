<br />The algorithm I use processes luma and chroma separately when you have the artifacts set to -1, so Nestopia should allow this. I made some comparisons between the three (RGB, reduced chroma resolution, reduced chroma resolution and chroma-&gt;luma artifacts):

<br />I think people have this insistence on crosstalk artifacts because the Apple II uses them. The difference is that on the Apple II, they are entirely predictable and thus can be used for effect. Not on the Famicom.
<br />
<br />As far as the bandwidth question is concerned --- while I would prefer the "composite" setting to be at maximum "resolution" as well for the reasons I outlined --- I'd rather add an RF setting for filtered Y --- we can all agree that for S-Video, "resolution" should be maximum, right?
<br />
<br />By the way, the car in Blaster Master uses color 15 in the NTSC version, but 16 in the PAL version. Apparently, Sunsoft expects a NTSC NES to have a palette that makes color 15 look more red than magenta.

The difference between these two questions shows two different paths one can take with an emulator.

<br />One reason I don't have resolution increased for composite is that this makes the chroma-&gt;luma artifacts too prominent, partly due to the part of the algorithm that ensures that solid color areas don't have any repeating patterns due to roundoff error. As for S-Video and RGB, the preset has the resolution slightly reduced since again I think that a computer monitor is sharper than a TV, and so there is some room for increase. The presets aren't magic at all, just a set of parameters to make it useful with less configuration.

<br />That's already been done:
<br /><img src="http://h1.ripway.com/blargg/temp/ntsc_waveform_emu.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />You might say that's not the "image" being sent, but the truth is, <em>there is no image</em>, just this waveform. The only image is what appears on a TV, and what appears depends on how a TV decodes it. The only other decoding method is what tepples described, where you convert the waveform back into the NES palette indicies that the PPU used to generate the signal, and end up with what an emulator has, which you can then display just the same, pixellated and without any blending.
<br />
<br />So I find this an odd standard. What else matters than what you see on the TV with a NES connected? It seems like that is the only standard to apply. Unlike with the Turing Test where intelligence is hard to define clearly, it's easy to define this. Kevtris will soon have his FPGA NES outputting the exact same signal as a NES (which isn't at all difficult), so the TV is really the difficult and variable part.

It seems like that is the only standard to apply.</div><br />I understand it's a very fine distinction that I'm making, but nonetheless it is a distinction. The reason I think what we have now is pretty much spot-on is because of the following - if you take the NTSC filter output, display it with a 15KHz video card on either an RGB or S-Video monitor, the result will be virtually indistinguishable from a real NES connected via composite (and if you connected that emulated output via composite it would still look really really close although you might have a few additional artifacts due to the two layers of composite, one emulated, one natural). To me, <strong>that's</strong> the gold standard. Besides, it's virtually impossible to truly emulate scanlines on a 31KHz+ monitor unless you're running at some insanely high resolution such that you can properly handle the soft scanline transitions that you get on a real TV - f you try to do it on a 480-line viewport then it's always going to look unnatual.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Kevtris will soon have his FPGA NES outputting the exact same signal as a NES (which isn't at all difficult), so the TV is really the difficult and variable part.</div>
<br />I understand it's not difficult, since the NES's NTSC output is pretty much fully understood now. My only question is, what more really needs to be done to the emulation except for maybe minor tweaking?

<br />Since PC video outputs use proper 180 degree colorburst phase shift every scanline, they tend to output pretty clean video. Or if you're using S-Video out, it's definitely clean. When I connected a TV via composite, the NTSC filter made the output look much closer than without it. Without it, you get something like the Wii's Virtual Console.

<br />It depends on how high quality. An NTSC separator circuit specifically designed for Nintendo consoles could sync to the pixel clock (3/2 times the frequency of the color subcarrier), find the peak and trough in each pixel, and recover a nearly pixel-perfect stream comparable in quality to PlayChoice RGB video. But such a separator would produce worse results for any signal that isn't output by an NES or Super NES, so it's not likely that any commercial TV will implement it.
