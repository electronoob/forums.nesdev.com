<br />How do you predict upcoming IRQs with that method?  It sounds like you'd have to constantly be keeping the CPU and PPU in sync (sloooooooow).

<br />
<br />That's funny, since that's exactly how Nintendulator does it. And it isn't really <em>that</em> slow - any Pentium 4 system can run it fine at full speed with zero frameskip with at least 25% CPU to spare.

Things really add up if you're polling multiple subsystems. It may not be a problem for emulating at normal speed on modern systems, but when you want to do fast-forward or run multiple emulators at once, it becomes a problem.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, PPU and CPU have to be kept in sync constantly for MMC3, but I don't think that's a big speed hit: MMC3 games on my emulator run about 5% slower than an NROM game that uses a catch-up method to keep CPU and PPU in sync.
<br />
<br />Having every read and write going through a function, instead of direct, is more of a 'problem' for speed. It allows for greater flexibility though, not just for MMC3. My whole emulator state is mostly based on a bunch of functionpointers.

<br />
<br />Eehhh..
<br />
<br />I would call Nintendulator slow.  Not that I'm trying to knock it or anything, but it's the only NES emu I can't get a steady framerate on (even with 1x scaling and sound disabled), and I can run most others ablazing with graphics filters, full sound, and speedy fastforwarding capabilities without a hitch.
<br />
<br />Granted my computer is several years old and it's not all that hot -- but I guess my point is what is considered "slow" is subjective.  I can say that in my emu, when I catch the PPU up between every CPU instruction, the hit in speed is <em>very</em> noticable.

<br />
<br />A design meant for catch-up won't be optimized for having the various subsystem emulator functions called every cycle, so it will naturally give much poorer performance than one originally intended for continuous operation (like Nintendulator). Thinking about this more, both designs require extra attention to different key areas: catch-up needs reliable prediction and precise "run until" functionality, and continuous needs heavy optimization for the code paths that run every cycle.
<br />
<br />And now I can't remember what this thread was originally about. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Same system I use, except mine's got 768MB RAM.
<br />
<br />Yes, Nintendulator doesn't even run full speed <em>on my own system</em>.
<br />This is one of the reasons why I want to upgrade. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
