		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Finally got my CopyNES assembled and tried to test it out.  When I try to dump a ls161 (cnrom 256) cart, Arkanoid in this case, it freezes on the dumping screen permanently after I enter a name and hit enter (no progress bar ever appears).  If I Alt+Tab to get out of there so I can close it (Esc won't work), restart, and select Dumping again, the QBasic code pops up and gives me a Permission Denied error. A line in the code is then highlighted referring to the mappers.dat file, which is completely undeleable without rebooting into DOS mode...not really sure why, but very annoying.
<br />
<br />I have to delete the CopyNES software and unzip it again to even get it to work again (or maybe I just have to delete the mappers.dat file, but I never tried just that alone).
<br />
<br />Parallel port is supposed to be on EPP, right?  I thought that's what I was doing wrong at first, so I switched it to EPP, and got the same problems.
<br />
<br />Thanks ahead of time if you can help!
<br />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So does it <strong>only</strong> do this with CNROM carts? That's very odd if that's the case. When I was first trying to get the QBASIC client to work, I had a similar scenario when I was trying to figure out a par port mode that worked, as in after you entered a filename, it would hang. I didn't get the access denied problem though, that's very odd in itself.
<br />
<br />Technically practically any parallel port mode <em>should</em> work, as CopyNes itself doesn't use any EPP or ECP features, but this of course is not the case. On the particular computer I first tested it out on, EPP was the only mode that fully worked.
<br />
<br />Currently, I'm running WinXP with port mode set to EPP + ECP, but this is with my own client (which hopefully I'll get finished up soon for others to try). But on this very same computer, Q's CopyNesW does <strong>not</strong> work for me. Just goes to show how touchy it is.

<br />
<br />The NES doesn't even have to be on to change between copy and play mode. For instance with my software, there is a "Test cart" button which you have to click before you can dump, it pops a dialog telling you to make sure it works, and if not, do whatever to make it work then press ok and then you can dump.
<br />
<br />Anyways what I'm trying to get at, is at this point the NES will be in copy mode. You can turn the NES on before or after you hit test and it will be in the correct mode when it's turned on. And you can turn it on and off to reseat the cart and whatnot. You could kind of think of it like, whatever mode you have the software put it in, it will always be in that mode.
<br />
<br />Eck, talk about an over-explanation huh <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> I really wish I could help you get this working. Is there anyway you can try it on some other computers? In the chance that it just doesn't work because it doesn't like you par port.
