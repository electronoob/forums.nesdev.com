		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />How do you define multiple banks in CA65?
<br />
<br />I was thinking of splitting each bank into it's own .asm file, and then compiling them individually with a batch file. After that  I was going to "glue" them together with a big "copy /b header.bin+file1.bin+file2.bin+file3.bin". 
<br />
<br />(I've done 6502 assembly before, but never across multiple source code files. I've always kept the code in one file, and then included things like constants and register addresses from another file) 
<br />
<br />However, I have discovered that that this was not going to work out. I can't seem to keep tack of everything between all the banks. 
<br />
<br />On the last bank, for example, I hard-coded a .org at $C000 and then hard-coded the vectors at the bottom. So far so good. However, I didn't know how to call other functions outside that bank without hard-coding their locations. I thought I can use the "Final Fantasy 1" way by making a jump table at the top of each bank with a list of known functions at the top, but there really wasn't a way to do this elegantly, for example, I would like to switch a bank and then call a subroutine without needing to jump to a table first. I want the compiler to "fill in" the addresses so I didn't have to keep track of them in a jump table.
<br />
<br />I then found out that the linker can keep track of everything with symbols, and even "glue" all my banks together too. I experimented with ".segment" commands and that ended in failure.  Then I found <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=6920" class="postlink">This post</a> (ca65_duped_bank_data.zip) that seemed to solve it, but I'm so lost with the code I don't understand what it's doing. I don't see any bank switching code in there at all, or any vectors, or anything.  The command "macros" seem to just share the zero page, I don't see how you can share things like work ram. Can someone break it down for me, or offer a better solution so I can just make everything compile and "glue together" in one pass and the last bank is made "aware" of the locations of the subroutines in all the banks?  Also, make all the banks "aware" of the variables in WRAM?

<br />
<br />As I understand it, you'll need 16 bytes of vectors and reset stub in all 32 banks anyway at power-on and in case the player pushes reset in the middle of something, no matter what bank mode you use.
<br />
<br />If you go with SUROM, there will be two different fixed banks at $C000, one for each half of the cart. Bank 15 will appear in $C000 if bank 0-15 is in $8000, and bank 31 will appear in $C000 if bank 16-31 is in $8000. Is there a reason you're using SUROM instead of SNROM? What needs all 512 KiB in this project? Understanding this will help me make the SUROM template more suited to your needs.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Over at Romhacking.net, we are picking apart FF7 for the NES. This game weighs in a 2MB. As for me, I've been <a href="http://wiki.qhimm.com/FF7" class="postlink">picking apart FF7 for the last 10 years</a>. The problem with the NES version is the game is massively unbalanced and the battle line-up is a mess. The more I dug into the game, the more broken the mechanics were on the inside. Everything from level growth curves to battle maths to enemy layout is just broken. I mean, it kind of *looks* like FF7, but at it's heart the engine is just all wrong.
<br />
<br />There is a design philosophy that all Final Fantasy games follow, starting with the first. The FF7 NES version follows it to a point, kind of, and then completely drops it. It wasn't because of space constraints, just a simple lack of knowledge of how the actual game does things. I want to correct that...
<br />
<br />I started with re-doing the menus. I thought it was a cute goal. But after seeing how broken the underlying engine was. I decided a rewrite would be better for it.
<br />
<br />So I need to branch out to more than just replacing one module.
<br />
<br />I'm going to try and squeeze a 2mb game into 512k. That might be difficult, however. I would like as much space as I can get because I can run a real risk of running out. (FYI, the actual PSX FF7 engine is 4MB, but that also includes some game data embedded in it.)
<br />
<br />* I can't use char-ram because I will be compressing the graphics to make things fit . I'll take the speed hit. The only snappy thing you need in FF7 is the menu, and that's only one module, and the music, which is in the kernel. 
<br />
<br />* The save ram can get a little  heavy. An actual FF7 PSX save is a touch over 4k. However there is a lot of irrelevant info in there when moving to NES-Space and can be cut in half. 
<br />
<br />* In a perfect world, I need a "kernel" sitting at the $C000-$FFFF that runs the whole show. The other parts of the  game are module based and banked in. (menu, field, battle, event, minigme). I would love to have 2MB easy just so I can optimize later, but I would hate to start the endeavor, and then smack against a hard wall and simply run out of space.
<br />
<br />That's the goal anyway.
<br />
<br />So the question is, (the same that I started in another thread of mine.) How big can I get a ROM that can play in an emulator. What is an effective muti-bank template for ca65? I'm not using the c compiler, but as I already have used da65/ca65 to do an Apple ProDOS teardown, I would like to stay with what I know..   
<br />
<br />(I would love to even take it further with cute 4-color B&amp;W full screen screenshots of the PSX FF7 game as "FMVs" by doing CHAR-RAM mid scanline bank switches, but now I dreaming. Also, just to let you know. I'm no stranger to big projects. I also did that Minecraft-Enterprise thing. Now that that's done, I'm looking for another project.)
<br />
<br />-- EDIT --
<br />
<br />To bring the conversation here, I also was recommended to use UxROM, but that doesn't seem to have any WRAM in it, or is that just a bit switch in the iNES header.

<br />
<br />
<br />And you say can't use CHR-RAM. I think you mean must. And as for that, I'd say you should consider using MMC3, or work on getting your own worked on and add it to your emulator. 8K CHR-RAM would probably need to have lots of sprites reserved for animations, unless you use multiple banks of ROM with would be CHR-RAM. Just because other games don't use it doesn't mean it's a bad iea, I myself am a fan of 16KB CHR-RAM myself, I think it'd make everything a WHOLE lot easier. You'll need to darken the screen between large tile swaps, but that's not all that bad. Do you need NES programming help besides the basic ROM/Board selection?
