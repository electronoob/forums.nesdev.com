One of those roommates has moved to Japan (and many times throughout Japan), and the other two still reside here in Silicon Valley.<br /><br />The game dev industry today operates still much like it did in the 80s: high stress environments due to deadlines and crummy managers, limited finances to actually improve the things that need improving (better artists, more play testers, better workstations or build clusters to make compiling take less time), and -- probably the most important of all -- just <span class="posthilit">a</span> general dislike of the games companies are working on.<br /><br />The place I worked at consisted of dudes who enjoyed working on their own side projects or (in one case) <span class="posthilit">a</span> fun/neat commercial game -- but at the same time they had 3 other games being developed, all at the request of bigger conglomerates.  The other 3 games were boring as hell, and every single division -- programming, art/graphics, sound/music, playtesting/usability, and some other group who I just describe as &quot;general&quot; (similar to usability) -- dreaded working on those 3 titles.  Everyone was mopey, stressed out, and just hated those games in general.  One short story involved the main sound engine coder/musician who absolutely hated working on the music engine <span class="posthilit">for</span> this one upcoming title -- it was flaky and <span class="posthilit">a</span> PITA to engineer because of <span class="posthilit">what</span> the game needed/wanted, so when he got stressed out he'd take <span class="posthilit">a</span> break <span class="posthilit">for</span> <span class="posthilit">a</span> few days (!) working on his own stuff like an Asteroid clone backed by tracks from <span class="posthilit">a</span> singer <s>whose name I can&#39;t remember &#40;quite <span class="posthilit">a</span> popular guy in past eras but pushed out really awful music, IMO&#41;</s> -- edit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBdSqk78nHw" class="postlink">Tom Jones</a> -- and at overamped volumes.<br /><br /><span class="posthilit">What</span> I'm trying to say here is that <span class="posthilit">a</span> game developers personal interest in something plays <span class="posthilit">a</span> humongous role in regards to the quality of work they <span class="posthilit">do</span>.  In <span class="posthilit">a</span> way, they're <span class="posthilit">a</span> lot like romhackers -- <span class="posthilit">you</span> have one or two guys who are passionate about <span class="posthilit">a</span> specific game, and their morale remains high because they have <span class="posthilit">a</span> personal interest in <span class="posthilit">what</span> they're doing -- but if <span class="posthilit">you</span> involve folks who don't have that same driving force or interest, they get burnt out quickly and end up disliking <span class="posthilit">what</span> they're doing.  Will they get the final product done?  Yeah, probably, but it'll be one of those &quot;okay it works, ship it&quot; games rather than <span class="posthilit">a</span> title that really makes people go &quot;wow, this is almost <span class="posthilit">a</span> work of art&quot;.<br /><br />This is why there are so many independent gamedev companies in Japan who big guys (Nintendo, etc.) often &quot;sub&quot; their work out to -- those companies <span class="posthilit">do</span> the coding/etc. and once the title is done, the contract is over and they no longer have to deal with the game.  In <span class="posthilit">a</span> manner of speaking, it means that there's always <span class="posthilit">a</span> light at the end of the tunnel no matter how bad the game (and the company can always refuse <span class="posthilit">a</span> bid).  This approach also exists in North America but I tend to find most of the American companies consisting of guys who just basically bang on keys and churn out code that's crap and then say &quot;give us the money, now go away&quot;.  I see this with smaller European (especially eastern) outfits too.</span>

The cost of <span class="posthilit">living</span> in California is fairly high (esp. San Francisco), but the lower paid jobs in the industry tend to be filled by locals who are already used to paying that high cost, and <span class="posthilit">for</span> the higher paid jobs I don't think it's as big an issue. There are also (fewer) companies in places where the cost of <span class="posthilit">living</span> is fairly low, like CD Projekt in Poland.

In fact, there was <span class="posthilit">a</span> <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/story/13/07/10/195238/india-to-overtake-us-on-number-of-developers-by-2017" class="postlink">Slashdot article</a> about this situation (well, sort of -- if <span class="posthilit">you</span> read the comments <span class="posthilit">you</span>'ll see lots of people touch base on this fact; <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3959071&amp;cid=44244409" class="postlink">great example</a> -- the key word in that example is &quot;retention&quot;).<br /><br />It's shit like this that makes me feel like I'm <span class="posthilit">a</span> dying breed of engineer: I'm not ancient and there are many guys who know way, *way* more than I <span class="posthilit">do</span> (many of whom are my own idols), but in doing <span class="posthilit">what</span> I <span class="posthilit">do</span> <span class="posthilit">for</span> over 20 years (and the time frame in which I was learning matters greatly -- 1990 to present), there are certain things <span class="posthilit">you</span> just learn as guidelines that many younger folks don't live by because they haven't experienced it yet.

There's just something about techno-involved youth today that scares me, and on <span class="posthilit">a</span> separate level, something about technology (especially today) that I <span class="posthilit">do</span> not like.  That's why the HP Lovecraft quote on my home page is so applicable to me -- I'm <span class="posthilit">a</span> technophobe who works with technology.</span>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I work <span class="posthilit">for</span> <span class="posthilit">a</span> fortune 500 company in information systems. I develop in-house software to meet our business needs. Most of the time this means being the technical lead <span class="posthilit">for</span> <span class="posthilit">a</span> group of contractors, although I <span class="posthilit">do</span> write quite <span class="posthilit">a</span> bit of code myself (it saves <span class="posthilit">a</span> lot of budget).<br /><br />My office is one of the most culturally diverse acres in the states. I work with people from dozens of countries from every continent (except Antarctica). The commonality I find is not nationality, it is that code quality increases as <span class="posthilit">you</span> have more skin in the game.<br /><br /><span class="posthilit">For</span> me, I hope to work here until I retire <span class="posthilit">a</span> dried up, penniless husk of <span class="posthilit">a</span> man. So when I'm working on <span class="posthilit">a</span> product with an expected lifespan of 15 years, I want to make sure it's <span class="posthilit">a</span> quality product. I know I'm going to have to deal with this thing <span class="posthilit">for</span> the next 15 years. <span class="posthilit">A</span> contractor who's going to be done with it the moment the ink is dry doesn't have that same motivation to ensure the product is correct, stable, robust and maintainable. Their only motivation is to pass user acceptance testing.<br /><br />We've implemented new workflows over the past few years that have really improved this however. The biggest change was that our IS division is now ran like an external software development house. Other divisions of the company pay us (in inter-corporate fun-money) <span class="posthilit">for</span> <span class="posthilit">a</span> product, and we as an external entity hire contractors to help us with the work (if it doesn't involve trade secrets that is). That way the development leadership are the ones signing off on the contractor's deliverables, not our business guys.<br /><br />Before we did it this way our business was paying the contractors fees and the IS division had technical leadership roles (or development roles in the case of trade secret or competitive advantage projects). The contractors would delver crap code, the business would test the product and see that it basically did <span class="posthilit">what</span> they want, the IS guys would howl that the code was crap and un-maintainable, the business would sign off on the contract anyway and then proceed to complain <span class="posthilit">for</span> the lifetime of the product about defects and the inability of the IS department to deliver on feature requests.<br /><br />As <span class="posthilit">a</span> final note, I write language compilers and 6502 assembly to keep my mind sharp. <span class="posthilit">What</span> I <span class="posthilit">do</span> <span class="posthilit">for</span> <span class="posthilit">a</span> <span class="posthilit">living</span> certainly does not fulfill that need, but that's not why I <span class="posthilit">do</span> it.

I'm looking toward working in real time embedded systems once I graduate (using micro-controllers, FPGA, real-time signal processing and this kind of stuff).

I wanted to become <span class="posthilit">a</span> professional musician when I was little but now I'm glad I didn't take this route because while this is cool, the competition is incredibly high and doing any art at professional level sucks anyways <span class="posthilit">for</span> many reasons.
