All I do know is what jackpkmn told me about random edit hacking. And what info I got from <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/nes/">http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/nes/</a><!-- m --> . Otherwise playing the NES and makeing broken NES work is all I know. Anything you think I should know? I have lots of random answers I can give people about stuff like computers, and the interenet, the US goverment, meaning of life ect. if you want something in return. I'm talking to much again so I'll stop now.

<br />
<br />Core is often used to refer to the main part of a device or program. Things usually have some parts that perform the main functions, and around them other parts that add minor features.
<br />
<br />An offset is a distance measure to get from one position to another, along a line. In computer science, it usually refers to the distance between two entries in an array of data. If you have an array of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, the offset from 1 to 3 is +2. If you're editing a file with a hex editor, it's treated as a series of bytes and offset refers to the number of bytes between two specific bytes, the first one often implicitly the first byte of the file. So if the file contained the bytes ABCD, A would have offset of 0 and C an offset of +2.

<br />I dont know. I just come in here looking for any information people will give me. I'm really not used to people who are actualy helpfull in any way... I guess I've been trying to make a rom out of scratch but hacking roms can be a lot of fun. I'm sorry but I'm used to this interface with people:
<br />Me: Hello
<br />forum person: Go away
<br />Me: Can I ask a question?
<br />forum person: No go away
<br />Me: why not?
<br />forum person: Becasue I dont like you
<br />forum mod: Go away topic locked
<br />Mabye I have bad people skils? Ok now I'm getting sidetracked. Theres only a few things I know about the NES and would like to know stuff about programming. The hardware itself is easy. Like fixing it and cleaning it and smashing it and blowing it up. But once you get to the software I have no clue. Also dont mind the spelling. Most the time if you look closely you can see all the letters are there ther just not in the right places. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1.- it was programmed with old and innacurate nes info. because it was programmed many years ago.
<br />
<br />2.- and for this reason, nesticle dont have the accurate internal behaviour that newer emulators .. like Quietust's NINTENDULATOR. I like disch's emu, too. and i like virtuanes, but i think virtuanes is not all accurate

<br />You have to first make sure to :
<br />- Learn 6502 assembly
<br />- Learn hom the basics of NES hardware works (PPU, APU and joypad registers)
<br />- Learn cartridge hardware and cartridge types
<br />- Try to do something with what you learned (don't exept to make an actual game immeidatly)
<br />
<br />Then, you will be able to ask questions that are more meaningfull than "how to make a NES game".

I think it's been about a year, and lots of the info for newbs you'll find linked to there is faulty or outdated. It's seems that people have all but given up on writing accurate, easy to follow tutorials, and after market nes carts are still a pipe dream as far as I know.
<br />
<br />Luckily there are all kinds of new projects for the beloved Atari 2600, with new homebrews almost matching early NES titles on graphics and gameplay, plus WIP ports of games like Metroid, Super Mario Brothers, and The Legend Of Zelda. We can all only hope the NESdev scene evolves to a comparable state.
