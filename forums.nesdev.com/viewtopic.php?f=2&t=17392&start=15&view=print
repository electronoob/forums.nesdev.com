		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You shouldn't be converting sprite coordinates into NT addresses directly, though... The &quot;correct&quot; thing to do would be to run the game logic in &quot;game world space&quot;, a space that contains all your game objects and doesn't care about sprite evaluation delays or scrolling, and convert coordinatrs from that space into sprite space or NT addresses when needed.<br /><br />Some simpler games (single screen without scrolling) do end up unifying all these spaces to simplify things, and will even set the scroll to -1 (i.e. 239 or 255) to push the background 1 pixel down so it'll align with sprite coordinates, eliminating the need to compensate for that 1 scanline delay that sprites have.

He needs to change a tile. That requires an address.<br /><br />EDIT, and I always forget about setting Y scroll to -1. I remember that Shiru's example game Chase sets the X scroll to 4 (on a transition screen) so that text is exactly lined up to the middle of the screen. Another thing I frequently forget is possible.

That requires an address.[/quote]<br />You wanna treat the ball as an object with a hitbox though; not as a sprite.<br /><br />A full-fledged metasprite system probably isn’t necessary for this game. Kikutano, you could probably get by with just having variables for the ball’s X and Y, as well as the X and Y for the hitbox. In the ball’s code you’d just update both one after the other. This way you can check for collisions on all the corners. Then after the ball’s done running, you can have a simple routine that just stores the ball’s X and Y coordinates into the OAM shadow. You can even subtract 1 from the ball’s Y position to fix the scanline offset problem people were talking about.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">DrawBall:<br />&nbsp; lda ball_x<br />&nbsp; sta $0203<br />&nbsp; lda ball_y<br />&nbsp; sec<br />&nbsp; sbc #1&nbsp; &nbsp;;account for the 1 scanline delay for sprite rendering<br />&nbsp; sta $0200<br />&nbsp; rts<br /></div><br />Directly working with OAM like this is bad practice for an actual game, but at the same time it’s good practice to separate “object code” from “drawing code”.<br /><br />Edit: BBcode isnt working for some reason. Maybe it’s something I did.

Positions, collisions, etc. should normally be processed in world space, and that's what you'd convert to other spaces (sprite, NT) as necessary.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Coordinate space translation reminds me a lot of working with OpenGL shaders.<br /><br />Anyway, for a single screen game like his, the translation matrix from world to screen space is simply [{1,0,0},{0,1,-1},{0,0,1}], ie. simply decreasing the Y coordinates of all sprites by 1 when writing the OAM table should be fine. The only relevant coord translation he should be doing right now is playfield space to/from screen space, unless he plans to add multi-screen playfields to the game which would be something incredibly stupid for Arkanoid.<br /><br />I know you guys like to go deep into discussing things and this is mostly a strength of this forum, but right now discussing metasprite systems, world coordinates, etc. will only confuse him in a simple game concept which only needs basic collision detection and video RAM writes.
