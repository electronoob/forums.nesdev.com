<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />you just need to know how to copy/paste some code<br /></div><br />I'm never encouraging anyone to copy/paste code without fully understanding it !!<br /><br />I only did that a couple of times in my life when I really had no choice, but I'd recommend any programmer to stay away of that as much as possible.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />It's complex to understand because it requires familiarity with what the underlying hardware does. Do not let anyone here tell you &quot;it's simple&quot;, because these people already have great familiarity with it -- don't be disheartened by their words.<br /></div><br />I don't have all that much understanding of how the underlying hardware work, and I disagree on saying this is complex, at least not as much as what loopy says (unless you want to know the underlying hardware).<br /><br />All you have to memorize is that the scroll can be seen as two sides of the same same coin.<br />1) The X / Y offset. This is the usual way to understand scrolling. X = [0; 511] and Y = [0; 511] (some of the range of the Y scroll are discouraged as they will display the attribute table as name table, but you probably don't want to do this - but that's another story). Registers $2005 (and lower 2 bits of $2000) view the scroll from this viewpoint.<br />2) The VRAM address. This is a single word that goes ADR = [$2000 ... $2fff]. Reigster $2006 view the scroll from this viewpoint. Note that this very logical since $2006 is used to set VRAM adresses.<br /><br />Now if you want to scroll to a certain position you can either write the X/Y scroll via $2005 or the VRAM adress via $2006, and both of those methods works.<br />HOWEVER, each of those methods have huge drawbacks :<br />$2005/2 (vertical scroll) writes only works during VBlank, so this method is problematic during the frame.<br />$2006 writes can't set the fine scroll within a tile, because you address whole tiles.<br /><br />If you change the scroll outside of VBlank, you can choose between $2005 and $2006. $2005 (and $2000) is good for changing horizontal scrolling, $2006 is good if you want to scroll whole tiles.<br />Now if you want to both change fine scrolling and vertical scrolling, you have to mix $2005 and $2006 writes in a weird way, because only $2005/1 and $2006/2 writes will be taken in account. All other writes will simply be &quot;latched&quot; and have no immediate effect. This is the only part that is &quot;complicated&quot; but it's really quite simple. Just write the values you'd write if you were only writing to $2005, and only to $2006, and it'll work perfectly. You don't have to understand what is the V and T latches or other bullshit to make this work, I can guarantee this to you.<br /><br />I hope this was clear enough to get my idea ^^<br />Everyone on NESDev has been overcomplicating this for years when I figured out that it was in reality quite simple. The only &quot;complex&quot; thing is $2005/2 and $2006/1 writes being ineffective before a $2006/2 write happens.<br /><br />EDIT : Ok I'll have a practical example. Let's say you want to set the scroll to Y = 9 and X = 12 (I just picked random values). This correspond to nametable adress $2021 (one tile left and one tile down).<br /><br />So if you were to write $20 then $21 to $2006 it'd set Y = 8 and X = 8 (in reality it'll set Y = 10 but forget this for now*).<br />If you were to write 12 then 9 to $2005 it'd set X = 9 and Y will remain unnafacted.<br />Both are not what you want.<br />But if you mix them in some way, for example :<br />$2005(/1) = 12<br />$2005(/2) = 9<br />$2005(/1) = 12<br />$2006(/2) = $21<br />it will work.<br /><br />Another alternative would be<br />$2006(/1) = $20<br />$2005(/2) = 9<br />$2005(/1) = 12<br />$2006(/2) = $21<br /><br />or why not<br />$2006(/1) = $10*<br />$2006(/2) = $21<br />$2005(/1) = 9<br /><br />All of them should work, and if they don't there is probably some other orders that will. As long as you keep writing $x0 to $2006(/1), $21 to $2006(/2), and 12 to $2005(/1) and 9 to $2005(/2), you can try any order, and many of them will work. Just trial and error. No need to understand loopy's doc.<br /><br />*) This is another thing to know is that the fine vertical scroll is given by the high nybble of the VRAM adress (normally used to differenciate pattern tables and name tables and palette), I never understood why, it's damn stange, but it's that way. Can only work for scroll values 0 to 3 unfortunately, 4-7 won't work.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> â€” Tue Aug 13, 2013 11:30 am</p><hr />

Lots of registers have sneaky little side effects, and you would expect to show up on a major listing page like this. For example, the page happily tells you how to set the PPU pointer using PPUADDR and gives you an example, but doesn't immediately make it clear that you should clean up after you do it.</div><br />It's complex to understand because it requires familiarity with what the underlying hardware does.  Do not let anyone here tell you &quot;it's simple&quot;, because these people already have great familiarity with it -- don't be disheartened by their words.  There is still to this day an immense dichotomy between the hardware-familiar people in nesdev and the software-focused people in nesdev.  Anyway, read this section:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_scrolling#What_the_registers_do">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_ ... gisters_do</a><!-- m --><br /><br />If you're anything like me, you'll probably read it the same way I have (and in some regards still do): blah blah, latch blah, Loopy_Blah, single-letter variables, internal blah blah, flip-flop blah blah, and more blah blah.  This is just the nature of the beast with the NES -- when it comes to the PPU, the registers in question are not &quot;fully independent&quot; of other features/things because of how the hardware was designed.  It's like this on even older consoles too (ex. Atari 2600), where everything was even more bare bones.  This document:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/The_skinny_on_NES_scrolling">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/The_ ... _scrolling</a><!-- m --><br /><br />...is a lot more revealing in what all goes on, but it's way too much for the &quot;standard programmer&quot; to take in -- it's overkill in a lot of ways.  But if you read it (and even if you don't understand it all) you'll see that there are continual mentions of what everyone has said -- that $2000, $2002, $2005, and $2006 all share an intricate relationship behind the scenes.<br /><br />There are other consoles where this this stuff is less of a &quot;problem&quot; (for the programmer), and it's one reason I still to this day prefer to code on those other consoles.  IMO, nothing PPU-related on the NES is simple.<br /><br />Since you offer some kind of &quot;online course in NES programming&quot;, I fully support you writing programmer-focused documentation that gradually introduces people to these nuances.  You will end up touching registers even during simple tasks that you didn't think you needed to -- and aren't obviously apparent to your students, prompting them to ask &quot;Why are you doing that?&quot;  You'll have to say &quot;For now just trust me, it's needed&quot; and cover the reason in a later chapter/section (advanced PPU operations, etc.) with references/links to the above stuff.  You can see that the PPU-related parts <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Programming_guide#Tutorials" class="postlink">of the tutorial section of the Wiki</a> are lacking (this is due to people not having the time -- documentation sucks up a lot of time, I speak from experience :P).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> â€” Tue Aug 13, 2013 9:55 am</p><hr />

I think Bregalad is saying you don't really need to understand the loopy doc, you just need to know how to copy/paste some code, or base your writes on:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">2006/1 ---- NN-- (nametable select)<br />2005/2 VV-- -vvv (upper two bits of coarse V scroll, all bits of fine V scroll)<br />2005/1 ---- -hhh (fine horizontal scrolling) (takes effect immediately)<br />2006/2 VVVH HHHH (lower three bits of coarse V scroll, all bits of coarse H scroll)<br /></div><br />( <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=78593#p78593">viewtopic.php?p=78593#p78593</a><!-- l --> )<br /><br />I have a question though. Is there any reason to NOT use this to set the scroll while in NMI/vblank? That is, instead of using using $2000/$2005 ? Then one could just leave $2000 as is and not mess with setting the nametable bits (via $2000).

<div class="quotetitle">IsharaComix wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I did some digging in the information related to scrolling and I wasn't aware that the same memory location was used for scrolling as well<br /></div><br />Minor nitpick: it's a PPU register, not a memory location. The 6502 happens to communicate with other chips by mapping their registers to specific memory locations (since it lacks input/output ports), but the actual thing being reused here is an address register.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />it's a bit unintuitive at first blush.<br /></div><br />It is, from a programmer's point of view. But if you keep in mind that these chips are designed to be as simple (and, consequently, cheap) as possible, it makes sense for the PPU to have only one register to access memory, regardless of WHO is making the access, the game program or the PPU itself for rendering purposes.<br /><br />If something looks weird to you, the game programmer, and a lot of things probably will (like registers being read/written bit by bit, values you have to write somewhere before some other task can be done, things you have to sacrifice in order to make use of some feature, etc.), there most likely is a hardware design reason behind it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> â€” Sun Aug 11, 2013 7:33 pm</p><hr />
