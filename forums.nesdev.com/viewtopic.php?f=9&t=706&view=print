<br />I know the NTSC is a 72 pin card edge, 0.098" pitch, 0.047" thick.

<br />
<br />I think famicom connector uses standard width, i made my a famicom connector by sawing-off a ISA connector, and the cart fitted perfectly.

<br />It does, but the Fami boards aren't as thick as ISA cards, so the carts will be kinda loose in the connector.  The boards are something like .043" thick or so, so it's probably better to use the connector off of a "honeybee' converter or similar if you want to get a decent connector.  Digikey sells 60 pin connectors, but again they are for .062" thick boards, and it'll be kinda loose.
<br />
<br />As for NES connectors, they are 2.5mm pitch, which is just slightly smaller than the standard .1" spacing (2.54mm).  I think nintendo did this on purpose to make life difficult or something.  The SNES connector is also 2.5mm pitch.
<br />
<br />Sometimes you can get a .1" connector to work, but it's tricky and won't be terribly reliable.  The best method as someone said is to hack up a game genie.  The NES boards are also .043" thick or so.

<br />
<br />It's strange but my cart isn't loose at all, i never had any difficulties with my homemade fami to NES adaptor. My cart is pirated SMB lost levels (quite rare i think), maybe it uses non-nintendo thicknes?
