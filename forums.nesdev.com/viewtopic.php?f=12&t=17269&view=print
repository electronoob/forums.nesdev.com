To which I have functions that I suspect are decoding data to WRAM to then be sent to VRAM as a batch. Which I would like to look at and test. <br /><br />The use case you mention is also a really really handy thing to have that would be nice for when I get to doing it my self as well <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Another feature that would be super nice, is the ability to set OAM settings from a place in VRAM. I.e normally you update a mirror then DMA blat it to PPU. Being able to say &quot;This data here is Sprites x,y etc etc&quot; and then see it rendered, so you can track the code that moves the sprites and see it update as it moves rather than wait for the final updates to be DMA'd would be nice as well.

Is there something else I need as well? I looked up the source for it on the web and it has a &quot;how to build on windows&quot; -&gt; takes you to an empty non-existant page. Looking at the dependencies on Ubuntu, YACC/Bison those and windows don't get on, I know from VICE, basically VICE just puts in the magic files that it would build on linux for the windows build. Sadly they stopped doing it. <br /><br />Is the QWebEngine in a specific version that has been depreciated and renamed?? I'm using QT 5.10.1<br /><br />What do you use it for even?

I’d love to drop in a leaner solution that can make its way upstream... The reason I needed it fast and threaded is that I have some optional logging done during game play, and the standard views completely ruins performance.<br /><br />EDIT: And to answer your question, it is the Chromium based QtWebEngine that is used. A lean, mean, 300 megs or so library...
