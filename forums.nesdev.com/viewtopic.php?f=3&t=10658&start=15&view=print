		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The MM2 triangle popping is really easy to hear in Crash Man's stage: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20047039/poppycrash.mp3">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/200 ... ycrash.mp3</a><!-- m -->. Here's a version with the triangle isolated: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20047039/trianglepops.mp3">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/200 ... lepops.mp3</a><!-- m -->. The period is set to 0 to &quot;silence&quot; the triangle.<br /><br />Those samples are using band-limited resampling via blip_buf btw, so that alone won't fix the problem. Pretty sure I've heard it in a playthrough done on a real NES as well.<br /><br />I silence (halt) the triangle when the period is less than two, corresponding to the ultrasonic frequencies (0 =&gt; ~56 KHz, 1 =&gt; ~28 KHz). I also silence it when the period is greater than 0x7FD after a tip from Kevtris, as some games apparently &quot;disable&quot; the triangle channel by setting the period to 0x7FF/0x7FE. Not sure how that would sound with overtones from the stepiness and all, but he indicated it probably wouldn't be deliberate.<br /><br />You could use a LUT for the triangle steps and premultiply the values for non-linear mixing as a microoptimization btw. The code still comes out pretty obvious.

The prominent 31st and 33rd harmonics of a low-pitch triangle add a noticeable metallic character to the intro. Later in the song, it gets silenced properly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Bullet Proof's Tetris uses the triangle at a pitch of $686 as a low fill or something, kinda unclear how it's supposed to work musically (though it's an appropriate bass note C, kinda). It wouldn't be caught by silencing $7FF though.<br /><br />In the high frequency case silencing the top notes is a compromise that produces a more accurate sound (despite less accurate underlying emulation) due to the limitations of your resampling process.<br /><br />In the low frequency case you're not getting more accurate emulation OR sound, so both of those goals are defeated. Maybe it sounds nicer though for games that do it. What games are these, btw? I haven't run into that problem yet.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What you <em>should</em> be doing is checking whether the period of the channel generates a waveform that completes a full oscillation in less than 2 samples. So in other words, if you're emulating the sound and outputting at 44100hz, then a triangle wave (or <em>any</em> wave, really) that is higher pitched than 22050hz should be ignored (and optionally, you can output the DC bias of the waveform instead, since that's basically what the output would turn into at super-high frequencies).<br /><br />This is the technically &quot;correct&quot; way to handle this kind of problem, but simply checking whether the period setting is low enough seems to be good enough for most games.

As far as I've understood, the triangle pops in e.g. MM2 happen on the real thing too, so getting rid of them is not just a fix for emulators but also an improvement over the baseline (if you prioritize &quot;nice&quot; over &quot;accurate&quot; in that case).<br /><br />The motivation for stopping the triangle instead of e.g. setting the output level to 0 was to avoid jumps in the output level. One downside is that it changes the phase of the triangle. Not sure how much of a problem that is in practice.<br /><br />This might be a stupid idea, but what if you let the triangle run until its level matches the DC bias and then halt it? That way you'd get both the correct volume level with non-linear mixing (I think) and also no jumps in the output level.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, the DC bias is the technically correct output, since a filter just removes all the frequencies above Nyquist, leaving the 0Hz DC alone, which is equivalent to 7.5 on the DAC.<br /><br />As for enhancing the output to reduce clicks, you could do a quick cross-fade between the triangle still playing and the DC bias. Experiment with the duration, as too quick will still have some high-frequency content that's noticeable. Or simpler, just put an IIR low-pass filter that your turn on when stopping the triangle, which smoothly moves the amplitude to the DC bias level. e.g. level = current DAC, then for each sample, level = (level * 0.95) + (dc_bias * 0.05)
