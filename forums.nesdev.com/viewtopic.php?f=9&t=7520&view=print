<br />
<br />I have written (quite some time ago actually) software to transfer iNES roms from PC over the controller port serial cable to PowerPak without the need to swap the CF card every time. The software is based on blargg's (not yet released) NRPC library/bootloader concept and currently is available for Windows only but the source uses boost and is cross platform. I'll release the source after blargg releases NRPC (which might take a while since blargg hasn't been very active lately).
<br />
<br />So far I've only tested it on my PAL NES. Is there anybody out there with the serial cable and a PowerPak that could test it on NTSC NES for me? More PAL testers would also be helpful to verify it works reliably.
<br />

<br />Yeah you'd have to solder, I don't think anybody sells them at the moment. AFAIK arfink might start selling them if/when Munchausen (the MMC1 flash cart) is ready. For my cable I used <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/Cables/USBTTLSerial.htm#TTL-232R-5V" class="postlink">FTDI TTL-232R-5V-WE</a> so soldering was easy.

The closest I can find <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=65293#65293" class="postlink">is this</a>, but I have no idea if that's the correct diagram or not (I'm also not sure what upload vs. download means in that specific context).
<br />
<br />Basically I need:
<br />
<br />1) A diagram that shows me what on the TTL-232R-5V-WE cable (specifically GND, CTS, VCC, TXD, RXD, and RTS) connects to on the NES controller port,
<br />2) Exactly what parts are needed (I see some resistors in the diagram that may or may not be accurate),
<br />3) Some place that sells NES controller plugs (the male end) to either raw wires or solder-friendly terminals.  <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Controller_port_pinout" class="postlink">This</a> will come in handy I'm sure, but the Wiki doesn't appear to list any vendors who sell controller port connectors (male or female).  Worst-case scenario I can find someone selling an old NES controller, but I imagine I'll get gouged on shipping.
<br />
<br />I should note that with regards to #3, I do have a <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=21&amp;products_id=28" class="postlink">RetroUSB NES adapter</a> if that could be used (I do not wish to destroy it, however).
<br />
<br />(Also, what the heck is with that "KHAN strikes again" crap at the top of RetroUSB?  It almost looks like someone hacked the site but it could be bunnyboy having fun.  ;-) )

<br />
<br />Sorry to add a second reply, but I wanted to mention that there's some speculation as far as why he's not around any more.  I actually have blargg's contact info (since he's a Parodius user); if people start getting worried, let me know and I can send him personal Email and/or give him a call.

<br />Oh!  *laugh* I hadn't been to their Homebrew section in a while.  It would probably do bunnyboy good to turn the text into a link to the product item then.  :-)  I wonder if the Khan reference is in direct relation to the character in Sneak 'n Peek looking like Spock...

<br />Hilmarf: I bought some USB cables like that (not that exact model, but a different clone of that clone probably, identifies as a Prolific chip but I forget the model), but haven't been able to get it to work with my setup yet.  The TTL part is 3V and not 5V, which could be the problem maybe.  I put a series resistor on the output from NES and hoped it would take the 5V, but it doesn't seem to like it.
<br />
<br />However I was driving it from a 5V PIC, not from the NES controller port exactly, not sure if that'll make a difference though.
