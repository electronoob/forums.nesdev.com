<br />
<br />Good question. If I can find the bit to open them I could confirm most of the japanese one and even post pictures.

<br />Sure, it has the particularity of being the largest (licenced) NES game ever released, but aside of that it's not really a video game it's more an interactive book so I wouldn't feel bad about making a devcart out of it (but I'd ask myself if he uses ELROM, EKROM or something else to handle the special 512kb CHRROM).
<br />
<br />I guess Uchuu Kebatai should be ELROM but this isn't confirmed until someone opens the cart.
<br />
<br />MMC5 has 100 pins, MMC3 44 pins and MMC1 24 pins. Why that question ?

<br />
<br />The implication being that one can recognize an MMC5 by sheer pin count.

<br />Right, so are all the Koei games too, I don't know how I came up with that. White are the exception, only Just Breed and Metal Slader Glory. 
<br />
<br />Also I just noticed that some earlier MMC1 Koei games use the MMC5 case but have "Nintendo" in place of "FAMICOM" and additionally some of the later MMC1 games use the "FAMICOM" like MMC5 so this isn't a perfect way to detect MMC5.

<br />
<br />Sometime since it's on my way to work. The only issue is that they opens late and close early. So it's not easy to shop.  Other place I go is Hard off for the junk (same thing as book off except for hardware). When I go on vacation to see my family, I go to a small store in Kyushu that sometime have deals. 
<br />
<br />For the price, I checked the superpotato website and usually their price is very close to the retro potato store in Akihabara (and usually they are the one charging the highest too).  But it changed a lot in Akihabara since the first time I came to Japan around 2003.
