Maybe you're just not looking as closely at it because you're aware ROM City Rampage does work on NES. <br /><br />Count the sprite palettes in this screenshot.<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/l7RhGEk.png" alt="Image" /><br />I'll give you a hint. It's not 4. It's not 5. It's not 6. It's not 7! And maybe you could argue it's less than 8 due to sprite overlays, but it's still impossible to have as many colors as it does on screen. It may even be possible to get a screenshot with more palettes, I didn't play for more than a minute to get this. I never really checked background palettes in game, but judging by the palettized city map Brian uploaded a while ago, I'm sure it's pretty easy to find too many palettes on screen for the background too. You see that bus in the screenshot? How many sprites is that? Why, it's 15 assuming 8x8 sprites. Just because things in this game are small, doesn't mean it doesn't DESTROY the sprite limit on the regular. It's even over in that screenshot with almost nothing going on, assuming 8x8 sprites. And before you say it could be 8x16, know that ROM City Rampage is 8x8. 8x16 sprites would mean fewer different kinds of objects are possible. And in ROM City Rampage, which uses 8x8 sprites, there are already only two types of cars (cop car and regular car) and very few NPCs. Retro City Rampage especially blows through the limitation no one ever thinks about, which is the sprite tile limit. <br /><br />edit: I should note it's possible my sprite counts are off due to scaling. For instance, the bus is 17 pixels wide. Maybe it's actually supposed to be like that, maybe it gained some width when scaled. Still there are way more sprites on that totally passive screen than you'd think.<br /><br />tl;dr: Retro City Rampage breaks all kinds of things EVERYWHERE. You may think it has a better style, but it's not due to being close to the limitations. I'm not saying your beef with Shovel Knight is unfounded, but man. Don't give RCR a pass, then. REALLY look at it. You'll clearly be very surprised. And that screen shot has the rudimentary things like shadows turned off.<br /><br />(For the record I think Retro City Rampage became a better game by discarding the limitations. I don't take issue with it taking liberties, I just think it's interesting no one notices just how many liberties it's actually taking. For what it's worth, I also think you could make a watered down Shovel Knight on NES much like ROM City Rampage. But ROM City Rampage existing is not a testament to how close Retro City Rampage is to NES. It's incredibly watered down.)

But there are even parts with PSX style parallax (way beyond Genesis). It's a weird mixture of 8bit and 16bit aesthetics: gameplay that's somewhere in between the two (but closer to 16bit), art that looks 8bit-ish, graphic effects that look 16bit-ish, 8bit music, etc.

Five palette sets, assuming you could use overlaying.  You could homogenize purple and brown to be one palette instead of two distinct ones.  Some of the color differences would be subtle at best, like the arrow next to Paramour not matching any of the previously mentioned colors.  On the background colors front, I see precisely four; gray/white/beige (building, trailer), dark green/green/yellow (signs), brown/orange/yellow (brick wall, dirt), and green/blue/light blue (sidewalk, pavement), with a master BG color of black.  The menu bar looks a little different, but just like the sprites, those colors could be merged without a serious loss in quality.  The color palette seems to use optical illusions to give the impression there's more color, such as the &quot;shadow&quot; near the buildings making the sidewalk darker.<br /><br />Sure, there's more than the NES allowed, but they're still LEAGUES closer than what Shovel Knight tried to do.  And RCR, as you said, exists in NES format, albeit severely compromised.  Shovel Knight probably wouldn't without extreme reworking.  Plus, didn't RCR start as a homebrew port of GTA3?  Brian chose the overhead style because, if such a game could ever be made, it would work the best on the NES.  Plus, RCR already has dozens of sprites onscreen anyway, well above the NES' limitations allow.  It also looks exceptionally cluttered with all those sprites, your screenshot is what I would assume the &quot;max&quot; would be on the hypothetical NES version.

That's why this is such an interesting situation to me.<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7yGRYg8.png" alt="Image" /><br />Here it is with the sprite colors crudely scribbled in. See it now?

There's more to the NES than graphical limitations. There's like... a slow CPU. ROM City Rampage exists. If you've ever played it outside the built in emulator of Retro City Rampage, you'd know it runs at half-half frame rate mostly. (It seems like it's designed to run at 30 FPS, not 60 FPS. But mostly runs even slower.) It's probably possible to do better than that, but the essence of Shovel Knight's gameplay wouldn't be hard to do at all. And your problem with its large sprites is an easily solved one. Both of these games run at resolutions larger than 256x240 scaled up. So the bosses in Shovel Knight could be scaled down to fit on that (with everything else scaled proportionally) and you're in business.<br /><br />The problem with Retro City Rampage that no one seems to notice is that it uses STUPID AMOUNTS of tiles, which is actually much harder to work around than making enemies smaller. Is it still as interesting a game with only 6 different NPCs? 2 different cars? Retro City Rampage doesn't even have the luxury of it being possible to make smaller, everything is already super tiny.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Plus, RCR already has dozens of sprites onscreen anyway, well above the NES' limitations allow.  It also looks exceptionally cluttered with all those sprites, your screenshot is what I would assume the &quot;max&quot; would be on the hypothetical NES version.</div><br />Right I said that. The sprite limit would kill a lot of tense moments that were had in RCR.<br /><br />Shovel Knight has big stuff. That could be shrunk.<br />Shovel Knight has multilayer parallaxes. They could be made single layer parallaxes or left out.<br />Shovel Knight may have gimmicks I'm not thinking about right now.<br /><br />Retro City Rampage uses boatloads of sprites. That's uh... a big one for this game, sure could still use less but less action then. <br />Retro City Rampage uses boatloads of sprite TILES on screen at one time. That's the biggest one. I keep mentioning the literally two cars in ROM City Rampage. Potentially could make them have 8 directions instead of 16, though.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">DragonDePlatino wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Sigh...Everyone here is missing the point. If your <em>average gamer</em> is playing your game, they're not going to think to themselves &quot;Oh, this screen exceeded the limit of four sprite palettes, and it looks a lot worse because if it.&quot;</div><br />That's why I defend Shovel Knight. I said earlier Retro City Rampage is a better game for playing fast and loose with the restrictions. Shovel Knight probably is too, specifically because of the parallaxes everyone harps on it for. I'm making an NES platformer myself, and man it's hard to have background decorations that are clearly separate from the foreground. I can even think of one place in Shovel Knight they didn't have a parallax background this and I immediately jumped off and killed myself thinking it was a platform. Heh.<br /><br />tl;dr: There's more to NES than graphical stuff. I'd have a much easier time making Shovel Knight interesting on NES than Retro City Rampage. I'd probably even have an easier time just getting Shovel Knight's graphics in.

And I don't see a single sprite where they have brown/orange/yellow, but I see dark brown/light orange/yellow.  Just like the first palette, those two could be homogenized and no one would be none the wiser, since the differences are rather subtle.  The two sets of brown and the purple palettes would be the issue here.

I've been following the development of that project on his Twitter for months, now.<br /><br />I even gave him a shout-out, with a 16-bit mock-up for Cat Quest. Using his palette.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My complaint with &quot;retro&quot; graphics is when people take that as an excuse to draw blocky 4x-sized stick figures with unlimited colors against really crazy 4x-sized background art at 1080p with no respect to the pixel grid created by the 4x sizing, bonus points for shaders and 32-bit color effects overtop of the retro graphics. It's in the same league as having really crazy chiptune-plus-real-drums-and-synths music with sfxr overtop of it. Maybe it's a decent game, but it's always going to be &quot;that indie shit style&quot; in my book.<br /><br />I'm not offended by Shovel Knight's selective adherence to NES-style limitations. The game looks good, I could care less that they cheated and added colors to the NES palette. VRC6 is definitely wanked a lot and by a lot of people, but it really does sound good, and adds a lot to the NES's APU. I'm just glad they didn't ruin it by adding reverb and pads and other nonsense like having 4 triangle channels or something.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">DragonDePlatino wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">As a matter of fact, the average person's conception of what is &quot;8-bit&quot; is something like <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2013/01/151-pokemon-transported-back-in-time-to-1986/" class="postlink">this</a>.</div><br /><div class="quotetitle">That page wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">a super-pixelated style, showing us what the pocket monsters would have looked like if they’d been released on the NES.

Yes, please shit on all of us, Kotaku. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> Not that this person's art is bad or anything, I'm just tired of people saying this is what 8-bit graphics look like, when they really mean &quot;that indie shit style&quot;. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
