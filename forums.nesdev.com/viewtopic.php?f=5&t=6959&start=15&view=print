<br />It's not hard to understand. It's like watching a bunch of back-to-back infomercials (or any TV really; I haven't watched in a decade) and expecting it to be something other than advertising, or looking in the garbage can for something good. Wrong place is all.

<br />There, fixed that for you. You are radio/TV's product: ears/eyeballs that are sold to advertisers.

The same is true for TV---intelligent people search for good programming and find it somehow, via youtube, netflix, or other internet-enabled means. What remains then on public radio and cheap cable and TV broadcasting is programming for the rest of the public---people who do not think, do not dream, etc. The unfortunate result of this is that, unless you dig around on the internet, one would think we are living in a cultural dark age. Which, we are, unless you're wise enough to look for something better.

<br />There are big differences between music and video. For one thing, watching video is a foreground task. Otherwise, you have a talk show or a radio drama with pictures. For another, music is a lot easier to copy. Ramifications:
<br /><ul><li>Much of the United States is obsessed with automobiles, preferring them to public transit. You can't watch TV and drive at once. Therefore, there's more of an interest in music on the go than video, and currently FM radio is by far the cheapest way to get music into a car. </li><li>People set aside time to watch TV and are more likely to put effort into setting aside time to find good TV. Music, on the other hand, is something that can be ignored because you're already spending time doing something else. </li><li>The United States Congress banned rentals of records due to rampant copying, but rentals of VHS tapes continued once someone figured out how to confuse VCRs without confusing TVs and started the company now called Rovi. So with video, people can pay for one performance on demand, while with audio, people have to pay more for a copy that can be played whenever, even if they turn out not to want to listen more than once. </li></ul>

The amount of compression and auto-tune on people's "voices" has now crossed from tasteless into tactless. Yes; it's actually insulting to me personally. I feel like telling producers, "do you really think I'm that stupid?" because they try and fool me in to thinking someone is just amazing at singing when their voice has pretty much been processed into a square wave. There is absolutely no musical integrity or authenticity in what you hear.

<br />
<br />Afaik, radio stations (or mastering studios, which I doubt) over-compress songs (or radio edits) because for broadcasting the signals. The longer the distance from the station to your audio device is, the weaker the signal becomes -&gt; too quiet. I agree, it sounds bad, little to no dynamic at all. But I don't listen to radio anyway, since they'll never play the stuff I like.

<br />I'm aware of this stupid trend. That's why I avoid re-mastered albums like plague. I &lt;3 old CD's / vinyls (before ~2000). Sounds awesome.
