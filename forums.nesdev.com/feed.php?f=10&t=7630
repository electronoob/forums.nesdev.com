I think the proper way, or one of them, to put sprites off-screen is to set the Y value to $F0. Alternatively you could just write $F0 to all of Sprite RAM. Atleast I seem to recall alot of games doing this. I guess that $F0 and up would all hide it. You don't want to put them horizontally off screen and not also vertically since the sprites would still count torward the 8 sprite scanline limit.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Wed Apr 06, 2011 7:16 pm</p><hr />

Hello,<br />I've been looking around on this board for quite a while now, but I didn't really write anything yet.<br />Well, to get started:<br />I'm working on a small game similar to Arkanoid or Breakout that will include some puzzle elements.<br />It is actually in a VERY early stage of development and there is not much to show yet...<br /><br />But for my question there is probably no real need for that anyways.<br /><br />I was looking for a table with some information about the screen positions of sprites.<br />I know that $FE and $FF are off-screen and how to get sprites in the middle, but sometimes I want to do more complicated positions and I end up trying to guess where to put them and then moving them in little steps and looking at the results in an emulator until they're in the right position.<br />Well, it's a huge waste of time...<br />Maybe it's just me and I don't see yet how the positions are actually arranged and why $FE and $FF are off-screen.<br />So, I was looking for a table or graph for the screen positions, maybe with some explanations on it, but I couldn't find anything on the wiki or here on the board and Google wasn't that helpful either.(Maybe, I didn't have the right search words...I'm really not sure how one would describe such a graph in English. I'm German btw. It says Canada on my profile, because right now I'm living here as an international student)<br /><br />To get back to my problem and (finally) to my question:<br />Is there such a graph  somewhere out there and if there is, where can I find it?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Grums<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4824">Grumskiz</a> — Wed Apr 06, 2011 3:41 pm</p><hr />
