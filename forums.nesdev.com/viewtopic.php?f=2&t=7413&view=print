<br />Yes,sorry about confusion.
<br />Having 16 384 tiles at one sounds insane.
<br />But there's must be some kind of down side.Does game slow down,or something? Maybe scrolling is harder to make?
<br />What about VRC7?
<br />I'm just curious.
<br />It's very handy to have so knowledge guys like you. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />Just the same way as usual, write the bank number to the register.  But instead of having 16 banks, you would have 256 banks.

<br />Not "difficult", just "different". Both the nametable and the ExGrafix attributes have to be updated at the same time, much as on the Game Boy Color. The part of the screen using ExGrafix usually has to be one-screen mirrored, as the ExGrafix attributes (tile bank in D5-D0 and palette in D7-D6) are applied to all nametables. I imagine that one common setup is to run the gameplay area in ExGrafix, with the left 8 pixels hidden, and put the status bar in the other nametable with ExGrafix turned off.

<br />
<br />The downside is that you need the MMC5 chip, which isn't cheap.  In practice what you do is write to another table of RAM (in the MMC5 chip) that contains the upper bits for your nametable.  So yeah that means more work for the code, but it's for an impressive result.

With that many tiles you can fill 17 screens without repeating a single one! Compare that to the usual 256, which can't even fill a single screen...<br /><br />Another great thing the MMC5 can do is give you more tiles for sprites... Since the background tiles come from those 16384, all 512 tiles of both pattern tables are available for sprites, if you use the 8x16 mode.

<br />One downside is that since there's only extra memory enough to "upgrade" a single name table, you are kinda forced to use single-screen mirroring. The other is that updating the background will take longer, since each tile is now defined by 16 bits instead of 8 1/2 (since 2 attribute bits control the colors of 4 tiles, the average is 1/2 a bit per tile) in the usual mode.
<br />
<br />Like Memblers said, the need for the actual MMC5 chip is the biggest downside. Very few games use it, and nobody so far has been able to make replicas of it, so making carts for MMC5 software will be very hard/expensive.

<br />So I can use 8x16 sprites+16384 tiles for BG?
<br />
<br />This interested me.
<br />I mean-CHR ROM can be swapped even in Mid Scanline.
<br />Thanks to that it's really easy to make animated BG.
<br />But if you use ExAttr mode-It's still possible?
<br />To be honest-I don't think it is.
<br />MAYBE it is,but it's hard...

<br />It is kinda possible, because there is a register that lets you to select which 256KB section of the CHR will be used for the background. Since it supports up to 4 of those chunks (for a total of 1MB of CHR), you can have background animations with at most 4 frames, but you might have to mirror a lot of tiles (the ones that don't animate).

<br />The MMC3 supports selecting from up to 256 CHR banks. In the case of mapper 119, banks 64-127 and 192-255 are hidden by a RAM. In the case of mapper 192, this applies only to banks 8-11.
