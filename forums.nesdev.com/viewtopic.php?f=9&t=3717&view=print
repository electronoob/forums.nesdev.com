<br />
<br />Now just answer me something about SUROM: It uses the highest CHR address line (since it's not used for CHR) to control the highest PRG address line, right? With that you select which 256KB half of the 512KB chip you see, right? That's not perfect, but could work for my game. One of the 256KB halves could contain mostly graphics, and maybe music.
<br />
<br />If I'm gonna use it, I'd like to have a devcart... Is there any other more common MMC1 cart that could be transformed into SUROM, minus the battery? Can anyone list games that use the SUROM board (or boards that could possibly be turned into SUROM)? The "boardtable.txt" file doesn't seem to list any...
<br />
<br />From what I've seen, SJROM and SNROM seem close enough to what I want, I'd just have to do the 512KB trick. I thinkI *might* have a SNROM at home. I'll check next time I go there.

<br />The only USA games that used SUROM are Dragon Warrior 3 and Dragon Warrior 4.  <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/" class="postlink">Bootgods awesome site</a> is much more complete (and correct) than the boardtable.txt.  You should be able to take the SNROM board, reroute the unused CHR A16 to the PRG A18.  A18 is likely tied to gnd on the pcb so you can bend that pin up or cut the trace.  Battery isn't required so cut it off or just leave it there.  
<br />
<br />Also make sure in your code to set the CHR A16 of BOTH banks to the correct value, or the PRG could be switched while rendering.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />- You said you hate the MMC1, but it's just a slightly enhanced UNROM like mapper if you look it that way. If you managed to avoid bus conflicts on UOROM, I don't see why you couldn't just make 5 switches to writes to the mapper. Just make a routine that does this for you (like you probably already did to avoid bus conflicts on UOROM) so this really is simple. The only difference is that you will have to manage more registers. Yes, 4KB bankswitching is poor (depending on the usage) but it doesn't matter if you use CHRRAM. Just write $0e/$0f (UxROM mode) to the control register and $00 to both CHR bankswitching registers at reset and you're done. In the case of SUROM, you'll want to bankswitch the main 2 sides of the ROM with the first CHR bankswitching register. The NESdev wiki says all there is to say about it.
<br />
<br />- It's not hard to make a 512 kB mapper 2 ROM run in any emulator. However, what is hard, is to reproduce it in hardware, you'll need one more '161 and one more '32 in order to make it work. You certainly cannot do this by simply modifying a existing UNROM board.
<br />
<br />- While only DW3 and DW4 uses SUROM in the United States (and a couple of more games in japan), any SNROM board can be converted to SUROM by changing ONE wire, wich is less than the number of wires you should change to make a SNROM board accept regular EPROMs. Just tie A18 to CHR A16 (the pin is originally on PRG R/W for some reason, SNROM have 2 pins connected to it). I guess Nintendo could have mande only SUROM boards and used them for all SNROM games as well, but for some reason they did just not do that.
<br />
<br />- I don't know if you will be able to sell repros if your game is labelled Sonic, so I don't think you will want to avoid MMC3 just for that. I may be wrong tough.
<br />
<br />- If you already made complex routines with CHRRAM, think again before to switch to (usually more limited) CHRROM. That doesn't mean you should avoid this, if you feel like doing this, do it but be sure of what you're doing.

Each swap will require at least 30 CPU cycles worth of code. That's just too much when you need a lot of bankswitching. I have however been able to think of a way to cut down on the ammount of bankswitching during the processing of the frame by rearranging some of the data in the ROM and by copying some data to WRAM. I'm not a big fan of the 4KB CHR bankswitching either, but that will not matter as long as I use CHR-RAM.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- While only DW3 and DW4 uses SUROM in the United States (and a couple of more games in japan), any SNROM board can be converted to SUROM by changing ONE wire, wich is less than the number of wires you should change to make a SNROM board accept regular EPROMs. Just tie A18 to CHR A16 (the pin is originally on PRG R/W for some reason, SNROM have 2 pins connected to it).</div><br />I'll do this to my Hatris cart.

<br />If I use the MMC1 I'll sure stick to CHR-RAM. I have almost made my mind. The final product will be closer to the original design if I do it like this.

Can you tell me if I can just undo this connection and use it for PRG A18? Or is the MMC1 providing this /CE to the WRAM chip? I'm lost with this one, can anyone help me out?
<br />
<br />EDIT: I'm finding very weird the fact that this pin is connected to WRAM /CE. Does that mean you can enable or disable the WRAM chip using the bit that would otherwise be CHR A16? I have never heard of this, because the MMC1 has other means of enabling and disabling WRAM, right? And if I do cut this connection and connect the pin to PRG A18, what should I do about the WRAM /CE? Connect it to GND?
<br />
<br />EDIT 2: Can a mod split this thread? We've been talking about the MMC1 for a while... so the title could be something like "Converting SNROM board into SUROM". Thanks.

The only difference between SNROM and SUROM is that PRG A18 uses MMC1's CHR A16, and that the pin used for PRG A18 is connected to PRG R/W (or PRG /CE) on the MMC1 (just like the true PRG /CE pin).
<br />A doccument by drk141 already doccuments this. I have no real SUROM board to test details, however it's not hard figuring out how it is.
<br />
<br />And also, everything is on the wiki when it comes to adding/removing the battery in a clean way, and there is starts of ROM pinouts, so you should be able to convert SNROM -&gt; SUROM yourself.

<br />
<br />I trought the pin 11 of MMC1 was called CHR A16 / WRAM /CE because it is the /CE of the WRAM on SOROM board (because this bit selects between two RAM chips), but maybe this is wrong, because this should be CHR A15 (I have no SOROM board to verify). The WRAM is normally enabled only by CE (pin 6), and the negative chip enable is unused (so I guess it's grounded). Maybe that's not the case on SNROM, tough, I haven't checked. If so setting this bit will disable SRAM, wich is weird. Maybe only older or newer board have this ? Because on SKROM, you just KNOW this bit can only be used to bankswitch the CHRROM, but things may be different on SAROM, SJROM (smaller CHR sizes), and SNROM (CHR RAM). I think the inverted /CE is used to chose the active RAM chip on SOROM.
