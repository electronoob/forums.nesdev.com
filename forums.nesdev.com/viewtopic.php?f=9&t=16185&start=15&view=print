		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Would some kind of IRQ be of any use? Or is that too much easier to just build into the cartridge?<br /><br /><br />I'm reminded that the RetroAVS has a <a href="http://nintendoage.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=Scoreboard.Home" class="postlink">scoreboard</a> feature built into it, so that's maybe an example of a permanent extension already in use.<br /><br />Maybe an expansion port adapter could connect to lots of stuff, but if there were to be one &quot;pack in&quot; device that comes with it I can't see it being anything other than an ethernet adapter of some sort. Aside from the RetroAVS' scoreboard, there have been other instances like the <a href="http://www.nobadmemories.com/connectednes/" class="postlink">ConnectedNES</a> demonstration, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBSdktDG_tk" class="postlink">ENIO</a>, etc.<br /><br />If it had a cable that plugged into the expansion adapter it could be easily swapped for something else, if there was some other device people wanted to use, but that's really the only thing I've noticed multiple people wanting to do. It also kind of covers the requests for real time clock, additional storage, etc.<br /><br />Maybe just thinking about what pins on the expansion port only have a single feature, and which have many... some of the audio and joystick ports seem like they only really have one allocation to me:<br /><ul><li>Audio expansion: already a given.</li><li>Famicom microphone: though personally I don't think there's much interesting use of it in games it's <em>probably</em> a marketable hardware feature.</li><li>Famicom multitap: more obscure than the microphpone (and I can't remember if the &quot;multitap&quot; famicom games even work properly).</li></ul><br />Aside from the CPU data pins, and the remaining EXP pins, there's still a few joystick ones left too. I guess you could make a connector that takes these out to the &quot;prime&quot; device, which might be ethernet (or ethernet + keyboard like the ENIO was trying to do), and any other new peripherals might just swap cables to replace it, or it could even be a breakout box device that you can plug more things into? Depends on how fancy you want it.<br /><br />The problem of ethernet and/or keyboard is doable through a controller port of course, but after tepples mentioned second-controller conflicts I started to think of how attractive a &quot;permanently attached&quot; device that is otherwise out of the way could be. A nice package of wifi NES + expansion audio + demo software all in one box? If it had a Famicom expansion port alternative version even the RetroAVS could use it, maybe?<br /><br />It'd be a <em>great</em> theme for an NESDev compo too. (A compo cart bundle with very viable self-flashing DLC?? Or even just WRAM you could download &quot;NESDev BASIC&quot; programs to? This is almost PICO-8 territory.)<br /><br /><br />Sorry if that's getting out of the way of the original question but I'm beginning to really see the appeal of this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually it's making me think that an &quot;NESDev BASIC&quot; might be a fun project for me to enter in the next compo, whether or not there can be hardware support (easy to add incrementally later on).<br /><br />I guess the most compatible thing would be just using controller 2 D3/D4, allowing connection via NES or Famicom expansion ports or directly through NES controller 2 port. Bandwidth wouldn't be optimal, but should be enough to fill up a 16k block in a few seconds anyway?<br /><br />Doing that wouldn't make the expansion adapter so &quot;essential&quot; but it could still help get the foot in the door. The expansion port adapter itself would probably be a low cost part in this equation anyway, but a good piggyback.

So would <em>Thwaite</em> or <em>Operation Wolf</em> or anything else that's point and click. Heck, so would <em>Marble Madness</em>, using the tablet as a trackpad to replace the arcade game's trackball.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Re rainwarriors' idea: Something like a game patcher for homebrew could definitely have some value. Throw a patch at an app icon, and done. <br /><br />Would a screenshot extractor be possible w/o too much hardware?<br /><br /><br />Re: Tepples: Right! Then there's shadowgate, maniac mansion, etc (provided an adapter is hacked in), + that game m-tee has shown teasers of. It'd also work well for my little submarine periscope project. <br /><br />On the subject of peripherals, how about an endless rotary encoder? It measuring change cw/ccw rather than a position should make it straightforward to interface. Any game or app that could benefit from precise movement or adjustment could also benefit from it. For games like marble madness, a graphics tablet/trackpad/trackball is better, but pinching an encoder knob would be more precise for 1d-aiming/adjusting/positioning/steering/delta-velocity types of games.

This isn't an actual PPU capture. You can send whatever information you think is necessary to re-synthesize the &quot;screenshot&quot; on the other end.<br /><br />I'm reminded of an <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=12879" class="postlink">older thread</a> where an &quot;NES video codec&quot; was being proposed as a way to compactly store NES video information. (An idea I liked, but didn't think would fly.)<br /><br />As for the utility of it, the current generation of consoles all have a screenshot button right on the controller. People <em>do</em> seem to like posting screenshots to the internet.

I was just pointing out that a generic solution wouldn't work for all cases.

But, since the mass, intertia and friction will be different between manufacturers and even models, it is precarious to make software which is overly dependent on this feature. It can be done, but risk being inconsistent. Unless it's a limited run cabinet/kiosk, which is what i sometimes <a href="https://i1.wp.com/frankengraphics.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/unnamed-2.jpg?w=268&amp;h=268&amp;crop=1&amp;ssl=1" class="postlink">do</a>, but touch screens have largely replaced trackballs in this field as they're a more direct medium for info/experience/browsing type of apps and come cheap. Else the &quot;spin&quot; could be used to move quickly through a large assortment of items in this field; something the swipe has replaced. <br /><br />If one can accept that results regarding free spin will vary in a more or less decentralized production model of a new controller including a trackball, it'd be a fun thing to take advantage of. I've experienced something similar live on an old soviet arcade machine where the steering wheel of a racer game was very heavy and freespinning, meaning the spin had some force/weight to it. It really enhanced the fun beyond the software's simple premise: avoid smashing into other things until the stage is clear.  <br /><br />Trackball HW (on Mouser, for example) often come with an optional encoder-to-usb-mouse pcb, complete with pins for normally up to three switches (read as mouse buttons).   <br /><br />If human interaction peripherals don't require the expansion port, though, maybe a branch is in order, if there's enough interest to continue the subtopic.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">great hierophant wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A graphics tablet only needs to give 8-bits of data for X and Y.</div><br />You might want subpixel precision, though.

This inertial behavior is also familiar to users of Android and iOS, who expect scrolling to slow gradually after lifting a moving finger. I guess this makes a trackpad a better match to a trackball than a mouse is in some ways.
