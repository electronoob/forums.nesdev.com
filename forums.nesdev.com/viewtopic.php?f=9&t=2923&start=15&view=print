<br />
<br />You really need to study the datasheet a bit to use this burner.  There's a reason more advanced burners make you select the specific chip/manufacturer, while Willem just has you select a generic type.. it's because you need to know what the chip wants and play around with the VCC jumpers.  And like leonk was saying, you can't use USB power.
<br />
<br />If that info doesn't help, my mailing address will be in your PM box and I could try burning one.

<br />You probably got them from the same person I did (cant remember his name)
<br />
<br />Are they AMD chips?  None of mine would work or erase either.  Then wanted to CHARGE me to replace them.

Never did get them to work.  They swore that they were good on their end but they replaced them for me anyway.  The also sent me some other brand eproms in the original batch that worked great.
<br />
<br />I used other amd eproms and have never had an issue so I don't know what to make of it.  I don't think it was a power issue with my larger programmer.

<br />
<br />Yes, if you look at the included jumper sheet you should see the jumpers listed on opposite side of the parallel port connection.

<br />I have the chips but my DC adapter's tip is loaned to someone who's out of town.. I'll get it back soon.  I'm kinda needing it for other stuff too.
<br />
<br />But most of the jumpers are labeled.  The one to select USB or DC power is right next to the USB and DC jacks and is labeled.  At least on my board, I dunno which one you have.
<br />
<br />That jumper and the VCC voltage one are the only 2 I've ever needed to change, IIRC.
