		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, FF7 has really good pre-rendered backgrounds, but thankfully the 3D graphics in that game are simple enough where they're still somewhat appealing. That was toward when the PS1 was first coming out, so there wasn't a whole lot of detail on the polygons. But then FF8 came out, and it was a total blur of crap textures, though the CG cutscenes were amazing, and FAR superior to FF7's. That's a different story though, I guess.
<br />
<br />A similar comparison would be comparing Wild Arms 1 and Wild Arms 2, both on the PS1. Wild Arms 1 had REALLY simple 3D models in the battles, and was 2D outside of the battles. But it was cool, because the characters were all 3D in battle, but it was basically a 3D model of their sprite (Imagine turning the sprites from FF1-6 into 3D models, so they still have the big eyes and no mouths). With those models, you could still tell what was going on, but there wasn't a lot of detail on them, so it was fine that way. When Wild Arms 2 came out, they tried to add a bunch of detail to the in-battle models, and it looked like complete crap, and you couldn't even tell what was going on. Adding so much detail made the graphics crappy, and thus lowered the quality of the experience. At least it did for me.
