Technically speaking, VRAM/CHR RAM/Sprite RAM would also be the same right?  It sounded like palette ram has fixed values that vary from one unit to the other, though?<br /><br />My main worry is saved RAM though - I just tested Zelda 2 with random saved ram values when no battery file exists, and it seems to work as expected.<br />Would save ram really be in a random state on a cartridge after putting in a battery, though?  (I am mostly clueless about the hardware side of things)<br />If so, I imagine most games try to read a specific signature inside the saved RAM to ensure the rest of the data is valid?

Hit pause.<br />2. Cold reset.<br />3. Debug &gt; hex editor<br />4. Type or paste whatever you want in there.<br /><br />There's no load file option, but you can paste hex data from the clipboard. (A load from file feature might be nice, though...)<br /><br />If you want to initialize <em>battery backed</em> RAM, that's pretty simple with a lot of emulators. Just make the 8k save-RAM file and replace the one that gets automatically saved/loaded.
