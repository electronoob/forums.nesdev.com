<br />Okay, much aprecciated. That would be great. :)
<br />I've managed with Geocities, but everyone hates it anyway,
<br />so i guess i better take the opportunity.
<br />
<br />Anyway, there will definately be a bugfix version of NeSnake 2. There still seems to be some bugs that comes once in a hour, also im experimenting with the new collision detection.

<br />Are you testing it on a real NES?  If not, make sure to get a few guys to test it out on a real NES.  I don't have a ROM programmer, but hopefully I will get my hands on a CopyNES and Squeedo soon <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />The font was originally without borders, but it looked bad on the display
<br />when testing on my NES. Adding border to the font helped on my NES, but.
<br />I'll try to do another solution with the font palettes or the font itself.

<br />That would requires :
<br />- 1 factory made board, that's surely a lot expensive (not much any idea, but let's say arround $50)
<br />- 2 PROMs (hum, well, let's go for $5)
<br />- 1 capacity (not sure that's needed, but all NES games have one) ($0.01)
<br />- 1 lockout chip defeater (this is possible to do it with several capacity, resistors and transistors to the security lines) ($0.15)
<br />- 1 plastic packadge that fits in any NES (I'm really put this randomly, but let's say $20)
<br />
<br />So the main cost is 50+5+0.01+0.15+20 = $75.16
<br />If you want to take any benefit from it, you'll have to sell them $80. Plus you have to sell this, and this is another story. Who would buy a such game for the old nes $80 ??? Well, I say all the prize values more or less randomly, if someone could put others values with more knowledge behind that, that would be interessting.

<br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">See also <a href="http://www.nesreproductions.com/" class="postlink">nesreproductions.com</a>.</div>
<br />Interessting, however the man uses real nes cards, to remove the original game and burn another one (he don't say that to the custommer, but I think so). I'm pretty much able to do that myself, I've build my own FF2 card, and I also made a false-label for it, but on normal paper and I just glue it on the original Zelad card, and it looks just fine. I've ever written NES-FY-FRA on it like it would on a real card (I've burn a french translation).
<br />However, I was surprised of how similar from emulation it was. The <span class="posthilit">graphics</span> are a little better, and playing trough the controller is a little more confortable, however it's not THAT different.
<br />
<br />If I need a board that can be found only in the U.S. like EKROM, EWROM or something (for example to play Just Breed, wich I doesn't need scince I've played the whole game trough emulation exept the last few battles, and I've been very happy even in emulation), this would be interessting.

<br />
<br />Lockout defeaters aren't reliable enough IMHO.  I'd like to see one that could be.  Nintendo revised the NES to make things difficult.  I believe some unlicensed companies eventually had to start including sheets with info on how to disable the lockout.  Even using the original chips really sucks a big one, when it comes to exporting carts to another region.  I've put some effort into RE'ing the CIC based on electron microscope images of it's ROM (thanks to neviksti).  It's possible to create a replacement, but not easily.  That won't stop me from trying. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" />
<br />
<br />Anyways, I've been making my own carts for a few months now, both to gain some practical experience and to raise funds for building Squeedo.  I've posted very little about it here though.
<br />
<br />Here's one I sold on ebay, a lot of pics there:
<br /><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;rd=1&amp;item=8207551746" class="postlink">http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;rd=1&amp;item=8207551746</a>
<br />And the main thread about it (reg. requred):
<br /><a href="http://www.nesworld.com/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=sell;action=display;num=1109963922;start=0" class="postlink">http://www.nesworld.com/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=sell;action=display;num=1109963922;start=0</a>
<br />
<br />After I get stuff going sufficiently with Squeedo, I'll be looking into producing Garage Cart #2.

I don't know if it just converts a signal from a Famicom CIC to a PAL CIC or if it just disables the PAL CIC, trough (does the Famicom have a CIC in it ?).<br />I belive it just has several capacitor, resistors and transistors. I can try to see their value and where they're connected if you want, but it's for a PAL NES so no guarantee that will work on a USA system.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Anyways, I've been making my own carts for a few months now, both to gain some practical experience and to raise funds for building Squeedo.

<br />Lol ! Did you really destroy 24 cartidges like that ?? Or did you just send the board's shematic to a factory, to eventually disolver CIC from you games, that you don't need because you disabled the CIC of your system ? In that case, why is the think copyrighted by Nintendo ? What is NES-MHROM ? Does the M stand for Memblers ?
<br />
<br />I hope for you that nobody will notice how plain is Hot Seat Harry before buying the card (or did you do a better revison ? The original one wasn't rally descent, as I remember (ooops... I hope you won't be scared...)).
<br />Do you really think that people would be suceptible to buy that ? Personally, I would found this offer very suspicious if I didn't know what it is.
