		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You might be thinking about FeRAM which is used in some EverDrive cartridges for SRAM. FeRAM has a limited number of write cycles (not read cycles) and will wear out. The developer said when monitoring SRAM use he saw games generally don't do things that would wear out the memory that fast. 
<br />
<br />SRAM is just "Static RAM" which has no limit of reads or writes. Atleast, no more or less than a CPU has a limit of cycles it can execute. 
<br />
<br />FeRAM and Flash, and EEPROM are types of memory with a finite number of write cycles. Usually the number is high enough that most users won't be affected by the eventual failure.

<br />Maybe on the Genesis, but NES games use SRAM as regular RAM quite often.

<br />If by juice you mean current from the battery, frequent writes/reads actually uses less because when the cart is in console and powered on the current comes from the console, not the battery. Note that this isn't significant however because the batteries are not rechargeable.

<br />
<br />Right, I was specifically talking about the EverDrive products for Genesis and SNES. Apparently most SNES games do not make rapid use of SRAM but I think you would expect that with its massive 128K of RAM.

There's literally no penalty to using on-cart SRAM, which is real RAM. Without having to double buffer memory your game will be faster and without waiting to flush data to the cart RAM a user has a better chance of their save surviving a random power loss.
