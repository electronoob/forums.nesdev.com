I wonder whether patent licensing only applies to commercial products incorporating FAT32, and whether unofficial, non-commercial software such as mine would be affected at all ...?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Markfrizb wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">That would make the powerpak very awesome.   My last contact with bunny boy -- I asked him about this and he said that he has someone working on it..... Would that be you or someone else?</div><br />It can't be me. The only ever reply I got from him dates from July 2012, when he said he'd put the firmware source code up on his server. Whatever I've done messing around with the PowerPak since then, I've been doing completely on my own and without bunnyboy ever showing evidence that he's even aware of it.<br /><br />Anyway, here's a current WIP screenshot of the new SPC player:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.manuloewe.de/snestuff/powerpak/v3_mufasa/mufasa_WIP_131207_TV.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Took me quite some time to get it done properly, as I had to both expand the tilemaps for a text buffer backup and implement some more HDMA tricks so the vertical scrolling offset doesn't get messed up. As you might guess from the picture, pressing B will take you back to the filebrowser instantly. While I was at it, I added some HDMA color math to fill the player &quot;window&quot;, and spent time drawing the frame, and joypad button sprites.<br /><br />More to come! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

An optimist would hope that this is because they're afraid of having the patent invalidated if they did sue the Linux Foundation; a cynic would say that Microsoft is more interested in extracting money than in keeping people from using the patented techniques.<br /><br />An obvious workaround for the powerpak is to create the SRM from the shortname. The ugliness is even mostly hidden now that you have a separate SAVES directory.<br />Additionally, maybe store the longnames in a non-VFAT manner, such as in a separate file like the umsdos overlay filesystem. If you wanted to be <em>really</em> silly, you could store this database as a <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.bat</tt> file that would rename the shortnames to the longname when the CF card was back in a windows machine.<br /><br />There isn't usually a 'commercial' vs 'not' criterion with patent law.

Whatever the cause of your issue might be, I suspect that a firmware downgrade (if possible at all) likely won't fix it. Regardless, I got your PM and will send you a reply with instructions.
