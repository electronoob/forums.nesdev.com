<br />
<br />I've added an "Autofix region" option. If you turn it on, the menu will scan the entire game while loading it, looking for code sequences where the game is checking bit 4 of $213F (the PPU PAL/NTSC bit) and patching those pieces of code to work on the console you're running the game on. This option is turned off by default since it makes game loading about twice as slow.
<br />
<br />A cheat database has also been added. Press Select at the main menu screen to go to the cheat database screen. If the currently highlighted game is found in the database (only a very small number of games are included so far) you'll be presented with a list of cheats that you can pick from without having to enter any codes manually.
<br />
<br />Here's a video where I'm showing these new features that I just described: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx4Xia4Bbdc" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx4Xia4Bbdc</a>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Personally I don't see any of those as vital/important additions to the PowerPAK. Game Genie codes can still be added to a ROM manually if you need them. I don't see any great need for AR codes especially since there would be no switch to enable/disable them as desired. That's also a potential issue with Game Genie codes I believe as the real deal had a switch. 
<br />
<br />The SPC issues are probably related to how it's very hard/impossible to totally restore the state of the hardware unlike in emulation.
<br />
<br />Open source is not very appealing either as we don't need cheap quality clones or other general misdirection. Things are pretty good and certainly improvements and additions would be nice but nothing mentioned recently is vital.
<br />
<br />By the way, I'm assuming that the Neo Myth SNES cartridge actually doesn't support any coprocessor chips via the FPGA like people were speculating? I know people got excited over a Super Mario RPG screenshot.

<br />Genuinely curious here, but I dont understand how releasing the SNES PowerPak menu/mappers as open source would cause a risk of "cheap quality clones"? I thought the key part was the FPGA firmware, which wouldnt need to be open source.
<br />
<br />The Neo Team have only released the source code for the NEO SNES Myth Cart menu:-

<br />The FPGA firmware has not been released, which makes a clone pretty unlikely.
<br />
<br />I just dont see why the SNES PowerPak can't be just as much 'open source' as the NEO SNES Myth Cart <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />They must have changed the logic for availability, like all their products are static and CPLD sized. Anyways, ProASIC are about as in-system programmable as a CPLD (they also use Flash), and in this case since the board doesn't have any bootstrap logic, it's not even possible for the SNES to reconfigure the FPGA (much less do so with a parallel-slave mode like PowerPak's Spartans).

<br />
<br />As for AR and GG code toggles if the PowerPAK for SNES could somehow manage a button combo that would be nice. 
<br />
<br />Link83, I'm not aware of details like that for the PowerPAK. The subject was brought up before about certain things being more open which for some things is nice and works well but for other things being closed is just fine. Any import features or fixes should eventually make it in anyway if they are requested by a large amount of the userbase I would imagine.
