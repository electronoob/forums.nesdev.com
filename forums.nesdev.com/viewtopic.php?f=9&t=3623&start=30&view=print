Yobo only cares about cost.  They will do what they can to save a couple cents.  Paying $1-2 per good NOAC is not an option when they are currently paying $0.10-0.20.  Messiah doesn't care because they are planning to use the extra graphics features of the broken NOAC.  To fix MMC5 they would have to remove those features.<br /><br /></div>
<br />
<br />Thanks for the other stuff your wrote, but I'm not so sure about a couple things here.  For one, Yobo doesn't do anything but distribute the systems and put their name on it, the systems are made by Gametech (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nesplayer.com/pirates/neofami.htm">http://www.nesplayer.com/pirates/neofami.htm</a><!-- m -->  and also see  <a href="http://64.233.179.104/translate_c?hl=en&amp;u=http://www.gametech.co.jp/products/catalog/2226/2226_1.html&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dgametech.co.jp%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26sa%3DG" class="postlink">extra WIIIIIIIIDE machine translated URL</a> and if anyone can read the original Japanese compatability list I would be grateful) and therefore are designed to be Famicoms, the Yobo systems are just Neo Famis with a 72 pin inserted instead.  Elsewhere on this forum ( <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=3492&amp;highlight=yobo">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopi ... light=yobo</a><!-- m --> ) 
<br />
<br />"As we all know, Yobo's Famiclones are not 100% compatible, even though the underlying NES-on-a-chip is reasonably sound. Among the reasons for this is thaty the Yobo devices do not bring the /CIRAM line to the cartridge edge. Games that manipulate this line, usually for 4-screen mirroring or MMC5 games, will not work right on their NES and Famiclones. "
<br />
<br />Now, whether this comes from being designed to work strictly with 60 pin Famicom games or just hasty workmanship on the part of Yobo and Messiah I cannot be sure.  To me it seems that the NOAC should really be called FOAC for Famicom-on-a-chip because whether or not they play NES games they were designed for a Famicom marketplace and thus probably didn't have the US or PAL market in mind since until the past couple years were technically illegal and couldn't be sold here (officially anyway).  There are probably only a small handful of people with the necessary tools and experience to know if this /CIRAM line can be attached or not since from what I understand the circuitry of the NOAC is basically microscopic, but to me it would be nice to know if the wiring or the NOAC itself is to blame for this incompatability.

<br />
<br />On the NOAC datasheet I have (sorry not public) there isn't even a CIRAM /CE pin on the die.  Even dissolving the epoxy glob and soldering micro wires you wouldn't be able to add it.  This breaks all four screen and MMC5 games.  Both the 72 pin and 60 pin connectors have the CIRAM /CE pin, so it is not a NES/Famicom connector problem.  It likely isn't Yobo/Gametech/Messiah/etc being lazy with wiring, it is the original NOAC makers like Novatek/Sino Wealth/Trojan missing something fairly basic.  
<br />
<br />However Messiah makes it even worse by using that pin to detect if a NES cart is plugged in.  Games like Rad Racer 2 which use the pin will cause an electrical short and the system will not turn on.  It is possible that could break components, worst case (not likely) would be a fire.  I don't know if that is from laziness by not testing before production, or not understanding the system, or just because they farmed out the electronics to a Chinese company that didn't care or didn't know.
<br />
<br />Quick edit:  The NOAC pinout on kevs page shows a CIRAM /CE pin, so it still could be bad wiring inside the clones.  Will have to open them up again...

<br />
<br />Hmm are you sure there's no CIRAM enable?  Let me check real quick.  I think there is, they just call it something else.  Yeah you're right, the Trojan part doesn't have an enable input... strange.
<br />
<br />And yah, the NES on a chip that I pinned ages ago DOES have it.  I am not sure who made that chip, but it is not one of the current manufacturers.  I believe it was fabbed by UMC (united microelectronics corp).  They made the NES on a chip that is in the Game Axe, and it is an actual REAL chip... the only NOAC I have seen other than the one in the Dr PC Jr. that is not a glop-top.  Both use the same part which is marked:
<br />
<br />UMC / UM6561CF-1 / 9711A (made 11th week of 1997) / M51601 (lot number / wafer number)
<br />
<br />It is an 80 pin QFP, 24*16 pins (X/Y)
<br />
<br />Sooo, UMC apparently calls this a 6561CF which is kinda neat.  The Trojan part number is 6168C.  
<br />
<br />Does the game axe run MMC5 carts?  I think it does;  I honestly don't remember now.  And speaking of that, MMC5 famicom carts exist all day long.  Think all those Koei titles and Just Breed of course.   The only difference between a famicom and NES at the cart level is the pinouts are slightly different, and the NES added 12 useless pins-  10 useless expansion port pins, and 4 were used for the lockout chip (2 from the extra 12, and two for the extra sound passthru).
<br />
<br />Both have the exact same nametable RAM setups though.   Interestingly, the chip I pinned awhile back is designed to be a famicom on a chip, because CHR A11 is moved compared to the NES pinout.   Other than that, the pinout of the two are "straight through" pretty much.   The NES on a chip products usually have the connections in "connector order" so you can wire it all up without using vias.

Is more info like this posted on a regular URL versus a forum where I can read it?  Since apparently there is more info on this than some have acknowledged I'd like to do further reading on the matter without having to bug all of you about it.

<br />Many of the games that do not run correctly on the Yobo/NEX are great games.  Did you ever consider that maybe you aren't very familiar with the NES/Famicom?

<br />
<br />well yeah, it says "made in china" on the controllers and console, so yes, they are made in china.  Almost every company nowadays has their product made by a company in china, its a matter that Gametech is the company responsible for designing it, or at least commissioning its design and Yobo just put their name/logo on the USA versions.  Almost no company really "makes" their own products, they just design them and have them made at a facility that may make hundreds of different products, its way too expensive for all but the biggest of corporations to really have their own factories.

<br />do I need to do a play by play?
<br />according to wikipedia for the FC Twin (for some reason the FC isn't listed but I believe its the same underlying circuitry for the NES portion)
<br />
<br />Bandit Kings of Ancient China -&gt;crap
<br />Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse -&gt;I liked the first one better
<br />Dragon Warrior II-&gt;crap
<br />L'Empereur-&gt;crap
<br />Rad Racer II-&gt;just play Rad Racer 1, its better
<br />Paper Boy (Disputed.)-&gt;decent, but I can easily live without it
<br />Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project-&gt;probably the one I would like to play the most, but I'm not even 100% sure this one is really incompatible since it isn't on the NEX's list as incompatible, so I don't know
<br />
<br />granted these are my opinions, but on the other hand you have SOOO many great titles that play just fine (perhaps sounding a little different) like Super Mario 3, Ninja Gaiden, Contra &amp; sequels, Mega Man 1-6, Rush N Attack (I am sooo addicted to this game lately), Monster in My Pocket, Bionic Commando, RC Pro Am, Super Spy Hunter, Duck Tales and other Disney games made by Capcom, Excitebike, Tennis (play it, trust me, you will be a believer) and the list goes on.  There are so many good games that will work on the Famiclones that the loss of Castlevania III and TMNT III pales in comparison to the addition of a reliable pin connector and the fact that you have a new system that hasn't been abused for 20 years (assuming you buy an NES used) all for ~$25.  I don't want this to turn into a debate of NES vs. Clone as thats just going to have 2 stubborn sides of which is the best buy, but I for one am interested in these consoles and enjoy learning about them and the ins and outs of why some things don't work right.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh yeah, another thing I would like to ask since this is my "Annoy NesDev with my endless Yobo FC questions" thread:  I noticed that when I switch on the Yobo FC, the picture doesn't actually "load" (I guess I should say) until I switch it to Video 2 (the A/V input channel its connected to).  To describe better, whenever the system is turned on, it first shows kind of vague outlines of the current game screen, then slowly colors them in.  I say slowly when it takes like 2~3 seconds max, but I noticed if I turn the system on and then switch over to video 2 that process doesn't occur until I actually am on video 2, so if I wait a minute it will load the picture and colors during a game demo rather than the title screen.  On the other hand, if I have already let it load and then switch back to the TV with the Yobo still on and then go to Video 2, it remains loaded and fully colored and doesn't need to reload.  I find it strange that the CPU runs the game data but doesn't output an image until I actually have it switched to the correct input channel, what on earth causes it to do this? (I hope I made this clear enough, it sounds confusing even to me, but hopefully anyone that owns one of these will know what I'm talking about)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The main problem is those "compatibility" lists gloss over graphics corruption in games that boot.  Good examples are the world map in Zelda and the menu system in River City Ransom on the Yobo (and possibly FC Twin and NEX?).  Those would be listed as fully compatible because they run, but they aren't close to correct.
<br />
<br />I don't know Famicom games but you would be missing out on Just Breed, one of the most impressive NES/Famicom games.  
<br />
<br />For the input it may just be your TV having trouble picking up on the Yobo video signal.  The Yobo might be slowly increasing the output voltage so the TV has to decide when it is noise and when it is actually a signal.

<br />
<br />So this is a fairly uncommon occurence?  I haven't tried it on any other TVs so it very well could just be something with this one.  None of my other video game systems do this including NES, SNES, PS2, Wii, N64.
<br />
<br />As for the glitches in Zelda and River City Ransom, I was never a fan of either one, if I want to play a brawler its TMNT 4: Turtles in Time or Streets of Rage 2 for me, I can barely to stand to play any others after playing those two perfect examples of the genre.  So yeah, I can see why people would complain since alot of people do like those games, but its still about on par with backwards compatability of first party systems (PS2 wasn't 100% compatible with PSX, etc.)  Even taking glitched games into account, that still leaves somewhere between 90%~95% that run flawlessly (except audio), still not bad.

<br />
<br />In other words, since the widely acclaimed classics The Legend of Zelda, River City Ransom, Castlevania III, and Dragon Warrior II do not run correctly on the Yobo and NEX, they aren't worth playing.  What about these games, are they worth playing?

<br />By the way, I have an HD-TV that I can sell you for the same price as other HD-TVs.  The only channels that properly work on it are old school analog channels, but all of the channels that are exclusively available in HD aren't worth watching... and those that are available in both look just as good in analog as they do in HD.

<br />
<br />But this isn't "next gen" or "backwards compatibility".  It is same gen, same architecture, not software emulation.  It would be like the slim PS2 not playing 5-10% of the PS2 games library, while changing every color and many sounds on all the other games.  You personally may not notice or care about those changes, but I am only looking at the technical not the opinion.  When the entire screen is different, that is not flawless.
