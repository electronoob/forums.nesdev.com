My biggest concern would be whether or not MFF implements a three-set hitbox system, with three vulnerable boxes, one body box, and attack boxes that can correlate to each frame of animation. <br /><br />I guess it would be down to how MFF is implemented and how adaptable it all is. Personally I think MFF's sprites and proportions would be terrible for this, as the hitbox data from SF2 wouldn't make sense on them, even scaled down. At least the sprites in Pocket Fighter or Capcom vs SNK for NGPC are a little more shapely. <br /><br />Also, since animation would likely have less frames than the arcade game, it's still important that the hitboxes behind them match to the arcade one more or less. For example, a 3-frame hitting animation that gets cut down to 2 frames graphically should still go through 3 &quot;frames&quot; of hitboxes such that the action is not disturbed by this omission.

But I tought if somebody is going to make a chibi version of the game anyway (i.e. not using scaled-down versions of the real sprites, but using cute cartoon-like sprites), arcade-correctness isn't that important anymore.<br /><br />So, yeah, when using &quot;Mighty Final Fight&quot; as a basis, you wouldn't need to bother with &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;'s hitbox system anymore or the frames. <em>This</em> game would indeed not play like the arcade game, but it would play like &quot;Mighty Final Fight&quot; without the ability to move up and down, but with the ability to do two attacks (punch and kick) instead of a predetermined one and with the ability to do special moves at will instead of following a combo pattern.<br /><br />Gameplay-wise, it wouldn't be a conversion of the arcade game. (So, unlike with the Super Nintendo version, you couldn't use it for training and then use the same techniques in the arcade.) But it would nevertheless be a neat little fast-paced game. And the game already provides the functions to include most of the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; techniques. They would feel different, but they would be there: Punches and kicks are doable. Jump punches and jump kicks also. Blocks and throws are already implemented. You can throw knives, so fireballs shouldn't be a problem either. And the fighters already know moves that look like a Dragon Punch, a Flash Kick or a Hundred Hand Slap. So, I guess every special move from the game could be implemented. OK, Zangief's Spinning Piledriver might be a problem. And Vega's wall jump stuff.<br /><br />But other than that, what do you say: Apart from drawing the sprites and the backgrounds and from programming the AI, would this be a mundane task for an experienced NES programmer or something really difficult?<br />Please remember: This one is <em>not</em> about making it arcade-like, but about making it play as a &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; equivalent of the already existing &quot;Mighty Final Fight&quot;.

I don't think it is fair to call such a project an analogue to Mighty Final Fight, as a very simple beat 'em up is much simpler than a complex and very technical fighting game. Mighty Final Fight is more of a sequel, anyway; it's a bit of a better game than that turd Final Fight (had to be said!)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />While the GameBoy might be a good source, it still remains to be seen how well the NES PPU would do displaying two fighters which use more than 3 colors. If you look at Mega Man, he uses more than 3 colors but it is done with his face being an overlay sprite. And i believe it's just 1 sprite large. Looking at Blanka as you colored him he would need quite a lot. Ken would need some but not as much. <br /><br />If you lose some color definition or carefully try to color things you could reduce the number of sprites required. Flicker some of the time will be unavoidable. Although here would be a fun thing to try. Imagine doing like arcade games did, and rotate your TV 90 degrees. It would create vertical scanlines that have a limit of 8 per line, but horizontally you'd have no limit per line other than the max sprites. Sure the aspect would be different, but you could have these bigger more defined characters.

I try to be accurate doing my mockups - but I'm never really sure if they are really faithful to NES' limitations. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />I suggested fighters made of 2 sprite palettes each because Street Fighter 3 (pirate game from early 1990s) also did this.<br /><br /><img src="http://hn.trochoiviet.com/games/modules/Nintendo/thumbs/iRgXgQDu.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />And this SF3 runs fine (probably at 60 frames per second).

It was mentioned sometime ago as a joke ( <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=9590">viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=9590</a><!-- l --> ) but I'm a big fan of these crazy concepts.

Since most characters need skin tones, one of the fixed palettes could be composed of 2 skin tones and some other useful color, and the other fixed palette could be used for all effects and attacks (blue, red and white seems good, enough to represent energy blasts and fire).
