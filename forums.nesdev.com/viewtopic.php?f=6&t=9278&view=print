		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I get the idea that you hate trackers for a personal reason. However, your arguments about limitations and using keyboard aren't correct. The first is obvious and proved by many thousands of incredible songs out there, the second - MIDI input support in trackers exists as long as the Space bar thing, and is very widespread, but in fact it is way less comfortable than just using the PC keyboard.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, the words 'hate' and 'limited' were poorly choose.<br /><br />What I really meant is that I tried many times to do something with trackers (not restricted famitracker) and that I always gave up after a few hours because I was getting nowhere, and could not do what I wanted. It's hard to describe but when I want to transcribe a melody in those lines, I feel like a disabled person which has huge trouble doing something that is in appearance extremely simple.<br /><br />Maybe someday I'll eventually get into trackers, but so far all my attempts have failed.<br /><br />As for limited : It's true it's not <em>huge</em> limitations, but :<br />- All tracks have to have the same tempo<br />- All tracks have to loop synchronously<br />- Triplets are apparently possible, but extremely tedious to make<br />- Only one effect at a time, and they hardly ever sound like I'd have liked to<br />- My keyboard has 'Z' and 'Y' swapped in comparison with English keyboards (we German keyboards in Switzerland) which makes using keys for tracking even more difficult. Thank god we don't use French keyboards which have almost all keys placed completely elsewhere.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There are many people who don't like or don't get trackers, that's perfectly normal. You don't have to like everything/something/etc and don't have to use it if there are alternatives that you like. For example, composers with classic musical training or education often has a lot of difficulties with trackers - the trackers are designed by programmers who happen to be hobbyist musicians, so this is different kind of abstraction.<br /><br />As for limitations you are listed:<br /><br />- There is no problem to make a tracker with different tempo per channel, it just wasn't popular (I'm sure there are trackers like that) because it wouldn't be any convinent.<br />- There are trackers that allow async loops, I can recall Raster Music Tracker off top of the head.<br />- Occasional triplets require extra work, but there are few ways to do that, so it isn't exactly 'extremely' tedious. Maybe just tedious. There are modern trackers without strict rows, more resembling a vertical piano roll interface (see <a href="http://www.aodix.com/pageaodixv4.html" class="postlink">Aodix</a>) - triplets aren't tedious there, but so far this approach didn't get popular.<br />- Modern trackers allow more than one effect per note, including FamiTracker.<br />- Modern trackers often has either fully customizeable keyboard layouts, or switchable national layouts at least. The problem with different key layouts on isn't actually a problem related to trackers only, you'll face it in any modern DAW, for example.

Everything is an async loop, and the &quot;conductor track&quot; (counterpart to trackers' &quot;order table&quot;) has row resolution for when to start a loop.

You have to use FamiTracker player to play it, it is availalbe in the Downloads section on the website (NSF driver source). Compiles with CA65, does not support sound effects, so it is not quite useful for games 'as is' (but could be modified).<br /><br />FamiTone is a different story. It is way less advanced than FamiTracker native player, but it is a bit smaller, a bit faster (good for games) and provides sound effects support. You have to use a special export plugin to get its data from FamiTracker.
