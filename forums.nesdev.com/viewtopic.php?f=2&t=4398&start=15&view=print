<br />I guess my preference for register names just comes from my GBA background, where there are about an order of magnitude more PPU registers, some of them organized into arrays of registers. It's common in C on the GBA or DS to, say, write a huge OR expression with a half-dozen flags and assign it to one of the four BGCTRL registers (which roughly correspond to PPUCTRL on the NES, one for each layer).

But how many time do you change all 8 flags in one shot?  Maybe not often.

I almost based mine on yours (I think you were using them in Tetramino, am I correct?) but I just wanted to make then more verbose.<br /><br />I'm sure that BG_ON could be verbose enough but if I'm a new programmer, BG_ON for what?  That's why I put PPU_CTRL_BG_ON in front of it.  Maybe I'm overdoing it, quite possible, I'm just trying to find a way that I'm comfortable with.  <br /><br />But one of my goal is to define some constants that could be useful for beginners. This kind of information is useful and often lacking when you start to program and I would have loved to have them when I started. I hope I can find a way to make them more "user friendly" and contribute them back to the community.<br /><br />But I'm still learning how to program for the 6502 so I'm testing all kind of possibilities and try to find out which one works best for me.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Roth wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> Man, this is the kind of thing that can change the way I code haha I might have to ease myself into it so I don't get carried away : P</div>
<br />
<br />Do get carried away <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> This is how you will learn what works best for you.   If you don't like it after, you just drop it and try something new. At least you will know how much it brought to your project and made you think differently on how to approach your code.

<br />The meaning of the NT bits in $2000 change according to how the mirroring is set physically in the cart.
<br />
<br />The thing is that Nintendo uses a different terminology than the iNES header. What iNES calls vertical mirroring, is represented by an "H" in NES boards, and vice versa. iNES refers to what is mirrored, and Nintendo to what isn't.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Just noticed you said "bit 2 of $2000", which has nothing to do with mirroring. Did you mean bit 1?

<br />It's a bit confusing that the iNES header is like that, but thanks for clearing it up Tokumaru. See, the thing that was confusing is this:
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">'H' solder pad is for screen arranged horizontally and mirrored vertically. </div>
<br />
<br />Which is how it was on the board, but I had to move the solder to the 'V' to get the credits screen to behave properly. Weird stuff hehe
