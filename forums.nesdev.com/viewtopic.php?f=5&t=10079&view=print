I do know that the one in <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Classics" class="postlink">Sonic Classics</a> isn't. What's worse is that because of some addressing problems (i.e. the game being in a different address than in the standalone cart caused some pointers to malfunction) there are some palette issues present in this version.<br /><br />EDIT: In <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yuyJQwAmNs" class="postlink">this video</a> it's clear that the 6-Pak uses the old ROM. Just wait for Green Hill Zone to start, if the clouds aren't moving, it's the old version.

Sega appeared to have some sort of aversion to using mappers in anything that isn't Super Street Fighter II.

The console is interesting but I own 3 Sega Genesis systems already. Though the mods are nice. Then there is the other obvious flaw being that this is &quot;nesdev&quot; you can bet there are less people interested in Sega consoles and games than at other forums. <br /><br />I'm sure you'll find someone either on a forum or ebay that'll pay a fair amount of money for that lot of stuff.
