Okay, so I think that's all I'm going to aim for at the moment.  I know for a fact that I have bugs in my CPU/PPU so I don't want to go chasing bugs that are the result of other bugs in my core design.  I think my MMC3 mapper implementation is probably correct at this point but the CPU/PPU bugs are making Blargg's test fail.<br /><br />But I am so glad that I got passed Blargg's test #1, error code #2.  That was bothering the crap outta me.  I knew my mapper/emu could at least do better than that!  I'm pleased with what I have now, especially since my original intention was only to be able to play a few more games so that I could have a better sound/music selection when developing my APU. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":-P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />In other news, the fixes that I've made to my MMC3 have fixed the Mega Man 3 boss-selection screen.  And SMB3 boots correctly every single time now - before it sometimes used to freeze.  Not only that, but many of my MMC3 games actually play just fine, no freezing/glitching.  Which is very cool.  Anyway, I think this is as close as I can possibly get until I fix my CPU/PPU problems.<br /><br />Thanks so much everyone for all your help. I really appreciate it.<br /><br />Pz!<br /><br />Jonathon <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3962">jwdonal</a> — Sat Jun 05, 2010 3:04 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Disch wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I'm not sure if this is the problem... but I don't think you're doing $C001 right.<br /></div><br />I believe $C001 is correct.  I think this is a language barrier issue from looking at the code you've provided.  Which is completely understandable.  HDL is dramatically different than say C/C++.  For example, in HDL, assignments to registers (or variables if you prefer) all happen in parallel rather than sequentially like in C.  So in the 'always' block I've provided only one of those assignments will ever take effect during a single 'i_clk_nes' cycle.<br /><br />Also, it is good HDL programming style to only assign a single register/vector (variable) per 'always' block.  You are only seeing one of _many_ 'always' blocks that are in my mapper code. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />To answer you question about the "i_rst" signal specfically, that is simply the reset signal to the entire system which will cause all 8 flip-flops in the irq_cntr register to be reset to zero.  This is useful at power-up or if I push a button on my board, or software controlled.  Every single one of my always blocks has this signal so that the system will always reset to a known state.<br /><br />As far as the bug goes, here's what I've discovered. I looked at Blargg's test code and realized what was wrong with my design.  Somehow, somewhere (I've been trying to find it because I swear I read it somewhere) I got the idea in my head that writing to $C001 is only supposed to prevent the IRQ from reaching the CPU.  In other words, "gating" an internal IRQ register with the ext_irq_enabled flag that I mentioned in an earlier post.  So as soon as the user wrote to $E001 (and if they did not first write to $E000), then any pending internal IRQ would be asserted to the CPU.  So now I know that writing to $E000 is literally supposed to prevent an IRQ from being generated - *period*.<br /><br />In fact, I just rebuilt my design with this fix and tested it and now I get error #7.  Progress!<br /><br />Damn, that was one helluva nasty bug.  Now it's on to fix error #7 ("counter should be clocked 241 times in a PPU frame").....<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3962">jwdonal</a> — Sat Jun 05, 2010 12:09 am</p><hr />

Okay, so these new MMC3 tests are working better.<br /><br />I pass tests #1, #3, and #5.  But I still fail test #2 with error code #3 ("counter should run even when IRQ is disabled").  Here is my code. I don't understand how the counter could not be clocking when the IRQ is disabled:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">always @&#40;posedge i_clk_nes&#41;<br />begin<br />  if &#40;i_rst&#41; begin<br />    irq_cntr &lt;= 0;<br />  end else begin<br /><br />    if &#40;<br />        ppu_addr_12_rise &amp;&amp;<br />        &#40;irq_cntr == 0 || irq_cntr_rst_req&#41;<br />       &#41;<br />      irq_cntr &lt;= irq_cntr_rv;<br />    else if &#40;ppu_addr_12_rise&#41;<br />      irq_cntr &lt;= irq_cntr - 1;<br />      <br />  end<br />end</div><br /><br />If A12 rises, then I decrement the counter (unless it's 0 or a reset has been requested by $C001.  There is no gating of the counter with the IRQ-disable flag at all.  So I'm not seeing how I could possibly fail that test.  Blargg, can you provide any specific details on how you test for error condition #3 in test #2? Hopefully I can look at your code myself and figure something out....<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3962">jwdonal</a> — Fri Jun 04, 2010 11:09 pm</p><hr />

I've also got those MMC3 tests <a href="http://blargg.parodius.com/nes-tests/mmc3_test.zip" class="postlink">slightly updated and improved</a>, and just tested with each run at reset (which I couldn't do in the past).

You do realize that the IRQ line is level-sensitive, not edge-sensitive, right? Just because it was asserted a while back, doesn't mean you should do an IRQ when the CPU finally does a CLI. You only do an IRQ (one instruction) after a CLI if the IRQ line is actually asserted during the instruction after the CLI.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Fri Jun 04, 2010 7:56 pm</p><hr />

I'm sure it will be very useful (just like all your other tests).<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />So I'm obviously doing something completely idiotic with either the assertion of the IRQ or the A12 counting.  No matter what I do I can't get Blargg's first MMC3 IRQ test to do anything but report error #2 (i.e. "counter/IRQ/A12 clocking isn't working at all").  I've tried debugging it and I just don't see what I'm doing wrong.  Regardless of any minor CPU/PPU rendering bugs I should at least be able to get better than error #2! Haha.<br /><br />Blargg's test writes to $E000, then to $E001, then a little later he toggles the A12 bit (via $2006), which causes my IRQ counter to reload to a value of $01, then he toggles A12 again, which then causes my IRQ counter to decrement to $00 and the interrupt output asserts to the CPU. Then you see the CPU jump to the IRQ interrupt vector. It all seems fine. But I always get a #2 error.  I must be misunderstanding something totally basic about how this is all suppose to work.  I have posted a link to a logic analyzer waveform diagram of the test running in hardware. It's essentially just a bunch of images of shorter time segments all concatenated together (which is why the image is so wide).<br /><br />Some notes on the wave diagram:<br /><br />- I triggered on the rising edge of the ext_irq_enabled flag which is set high on a write to $E001<br />- The "i_" and "o_" prefixes simply tell you if the signal is an input to the mapper or an output of the mapper<br />- The numbers across the top represent the number of NES master clock (21.47727M) cycles<br />- i_clk_en_cpu is the div-by-12 CPU clock enable<br />- irq_disable_write asserts on writes to $E000<br />- irq_enable_write asserts on writes to $E001<br />- irq_cntr_reloaded asserts when the IRQ counter reloads<br />- cpu_irq_n_int is the internal (i.e. internal to the mapper) version of the IRQ output<br />- ext_irq_enabled is the "gate" that cpu_irq_n_int must pass through before it will be asserted to the CPU<br />- o_cpu_irq_n is the actual IRQ "pin" on the mapper<br />- irq_cntr_rv is the count latch (reload value) register which is updated on every write to $C000 - in this case, Blargg has written a $01 to this register (not shown in the wave diagram).<br />- irq_cntr is the IRQ counter that is decremented/reloaded on each rising edge of A12<br />- i_cpu_r_w_n is the CPU's R/W flag<br />- i_cpu_addr is the CPU's 16-bit address bus<br />- i_cpu_do is the data output from the CPU to the mapper<br />- i_ppu_addr is the PPU's 14-bit address bus<br />- q_i_ppu_addr_12 is the value of PPU A12 from the _previous_ NES master clock cycle (this is what I use to detect a rising edge of A12<br />- ppu_addr_12_rise asserts whenever A12 rises and is used to know when to decrement the IRQ counter<br />- As of right now I'm not concerned with ignoring too many A12 rises close together. I'm just trying to fix Blargg's #2 error.<br /><br /><a href="http://rm-rfroot.net/files/courses/2010_06_04_wave.JPG" class="postlink">Wave Diagram (2MB)</a><br /><br />I could actually upload the original VCD file if anyone is interested (you could then use the free GTKwave to view the real waveform diagrams). Just let me know.<br /><br />Any help is appreciated. I'm pretty much out of ideas on how I can get Blargg's first test beyond error #2.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Jonathon<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3962">jwdonal</a> — Fri Jun 04, 2010 5:37 pm</p><hr />
