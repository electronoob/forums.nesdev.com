<br />
<br /><img src="http://oi54.tinypic.com/6nwm10.jpg" alt="Image" /> <img src="http://oi55.tinypic.com/2e2fscl.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />It is an implementation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteen_puzzle" class="postlink">Fifteen Puzzle</a> for the NES. It even includes an auto-solver you can watch solve the puzzle for you.
<br />
<br />Until I can come up with a better hosting solution, the game can be found <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mbrenaman/" class="postlink">here</a>. The source code is released under a simple BSD-style license and is included with the game. Please see the 'README' and 'LICENSE' files for more details. Comments and questions are very much welcome.

<br />I have been working on a similar project with Game Maker for PC, and I'd be willing to share some of my plans that I think could be implemented in an NES version.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sweet! You know, oddly enough, when I started NESDev, I was planning on making this game, but never actually got around to it (and actually, forgot about it).
<br />
<br />It's funny, the puzzles I usually solve leave the blank space in the top-left corner. I was trying to solve it forever that way, and kept ending up with two switched peices, which actually brings me to a question. Is it possible to solve one of these no matter how the peices are arranged? Or are there some impossible starting layouts?

<br />
<br />No, it is not possible to solve for any given random arrange of pieces.  IIRC, 50% of random arrangements are solvable and 50% are not.  I forget the proof, but it deals with an even and odd acid test.

<br />
<br />I forgot to include links to various websites about the puzzle in the README file unfortunately... However, I found the explanation about solvability  <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mdr/teaching/modules04/java2/TilesSolvability.html" class="postlink">here</a> to be rather readable if you are interested.

You don't need a cursor - there is always only one tile for one direction on the field, so it is enough to just move a tile when a direction pressed. Much faster and optimal to play (less keypresses), also less code work.
<br />
<br />Also, I would prefer to solve a puzzle with nice picture instead of boring numbers, but this is not easy technically, so numbers are OK.

<br />Either that or do like the FF1 version : allow to move multiple aligned pads in a single moves.

<br />
<br />Interesting. That is probably why even after 4000 moves, I could not solve the puzzle with the top-left space left blank!
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />
<br />Just bested my previous score: 124!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It is very nicely done.  I like the cursor movement also, but I do agree with what Shiru's point about the controls being more complicated than needed.  On the plus side, now anyone can look into the source code and see what you did to move the cursor like that.
<br />
<br />The sound and the AI solver is pretty nice too.  It's a pretty simple game by design, but it feels like it's finished, which isn't extremely common around here, heheh.

<br />Click on 9 to move both 15 and 9 up.

<br />However, this game doesn't implement that behaviour. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Anyways, nicely polished game, hope the bug keeps biting!
