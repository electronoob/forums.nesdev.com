<br />I was looking for information on how to create a simple BASIC to ASM conversion tool, and stumbled across someone who had disassembled Microsoft's BASIC for various 6502 processors.  Obviously some modifications to the source would have to be made to run it on a nes, but it would be pretty cool to see it running.
<br />
<br />Too bad the NES has no keyboard, but it still might be cool to create basic apps which could be stored in memory and run.  It's also useful to see how certain things are pulled off 
<br />
<br />anyways, check it out <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />The famicom got a keyboard with a basic cartridge too.  Never had the chance to use it but saw a few times in japan.

<br />I had an atari 400 when I was super young that my uncle gave me.. it had a keyboard and a BASIC cart as well, but I had no idea what it was for.  I always though it was the worst game LOL

<br />
<br />This is a good question.  Since I never tried the real thing I cannot say.  I may acquire one someday since they had a few near my in laws house.  The price was not so bad. In Tokyo... too expensive.

It was a long time ago though.  It seemed obscure, I think the emulator might've been NNNesterJ but I could be remembering wrong.  Certainly it was an emulator that was written or modified by some Japanese folks.
<br />
<br />All I found out was that it was based on HuBASIC by Hudson, I found the list of token words in the ROM file, and also I remembered that I was not a big fan of BASIC programming (but I liked it's MML type of MUSIC command).

<br />lol.. yeah.. I learned to program with QBasic and GWBasic, but now when I look at BASIC code i cringe
