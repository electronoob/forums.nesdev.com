Since it is public domain if someone else make, and in case I never manage to do so, I may buy it from you, too.<br /><br />PAL version could also be possible, which might omit some features listed above if there are any not suitable for PAL, but it would include both 60-pins and 72-pins, with CIC lockout to detect NTSC/PAL cartridge (with PAL as first preference, in case of multi-region CIC); if you insert 60-pins cartridges or 72-pins NTSC, then it use Dendy mode, if using PAL cartridge, it can use NES mode.

But in case someone does make a mapper using that area, it may still be possible to work by adding a switch to turn it on/off. What precisely is this going to do anyways? Can you give more details please? If it is use only for homebrew and not for other cartridges, it could be something in the development cartridge. Otherwise it could be included in the console too if you need it running while other cartridges is inserted too. However, some things to experiment with mappers of other cartridges (even dumping other cartridges) may be possible with internal PRG ROM, to load a program into RAM and then the other cartridge can be inserted. However this might not work perfectly in case of soft reset detect by cartridges.

Based on CopyNES idea, but more powerfull because it is not based on standard PCB but using custom one instead. Indeed, CPU internal registers are inside $4000-$401F region.

Much easier cut $4000-$401F one piece. But, this will cause a conflict with FDC, so I just use RAM and PPU mirrors in my CopyFamiClone, leave $4000-$FFFF untouched like in original map. So, full map is: $0000-$3FFB solid RAM piece, 3FFC-3FFF service registers, $2000-$200F - PPU, $2020-$3FFF - additional solid piece of RAM. FLASH and cartrige are connected together with some shadow technique. And there 2 16bit switchable registers for NMI/IRQ vectors, RESET vector is always $8000. That is all.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, you can always use a custom-made motherboard, but I'm sure very few users would be actually capable of assembling it.<br /><br />On a stock NES/Famicom motherboard, you'll need to intercept the address on the CPU pins before it gets to the motherboard, which is hard as NES motherboards aren't the best ones and they may get easily damaged when desoldering the CPU.<br /><br />And definately it'll be impossible on a Famiclone, due to the RAM being internally decoded.<br /><br />Using the 4018-401F is easier. As that area is not used, you don't need to intercept the CPU addresses. You can implement it as modchip, as a GameGenie-like cartridge, or even add it directly inside the development cartridge. It is thus compatible with modified and stock motherboards, and even Famiclones.
