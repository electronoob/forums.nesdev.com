Now here is an evidence created by Eugene.S and HardWareMan. I think it is a good thing to have certain information about this posted on the forum, so if someone else became interested in this in the future, he'll be able to find it.
<br />
<br />The bug is observed on UA6527P, HA6527P and some other early 2A03 clones, except for TA-03NP1-6527P. I often heard that the bug is common for newer clones, but in fact these chips are found in really old ones, newer were all-SoC (a glop or integrated CPU+PPU T1818P and UM6561) and didn't have the bug.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?k2bs7us5kc5taly" class="postlink">Here is a recording</a> (53MB, FLAC) of songs from Bucky O'Hare and first level of Batman. It was done from a clone with one of the buggy chips, with good audio output, and SB X-Fi soundcard on PC, without any additional processing.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?php3khmi2pf7a28" class="postlink">Here is a test program and recordings</a> (8MB) that were made with 6 different chips.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, it's pretty interesting to have an evidence, I already heard about the duty cycle swapping bug, but hearing tracks with swapped duty cycles is definitely more interesting.
<br />
<br />Apparently, duty cycle 0 (87.5%) is emulated right, while 1 sounds like 2 (50%) and 2 sounds like 1 (75%), and 3 sounds like 1 anyways so you don't care if it's 25% or 75% (WHY Nindendo ?? They could have added one more duty cycle instead and it would increase the musical possibilities of the console !! Oh well...)
<br />
<br />So yeah it's fun to hear the music with duty cycles swapped.
<br />Is there an emulator that can optionally enable duty cycle swapping ?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, in many games this swap is surprisingly unnoticeable. Many modern NES games switch duty cycles quickly during notes anyways, so this make the swap less noticeable than in old games where the just use plain notes of the same duty cycle for a whole song.
<br />
<br />Where the swap the most noticeable is in Mega Man games and Mario games. In Mega Man games I find it actually makes sound effects better.

<br />
<br />Do you just swap bits 7 and 6 on $4000 and $4004?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's too bad. For fun though I added an option to my own emulator to swap duty cycles on the fly. As I remember with the HandiFamiEight clone I had, SMB1 has odd sound effects with swapped duty cycles. I really don't understand how anyone could have missed that mistake. Maybe they knew it but didn't bother to fix it. It's a shame since I've heard the clones are basically exact clones otherwise.

<br />It's not like this changed gameplay, or even music, significantly. The more noticeable part is sound effects in SMB and Mega Man as I've said.

<br />It'd be possible to "say it loud" more literally. Make a 1-bit PCM sample (not the same as 1-bit DPCM). Play it back with zeroes alternating rapidly between 50% (1/3) and 12.5% (2/3) and ones at 25%. If you can hear it, you're on a problematic clone. I'd make a demo myself, but the clones that have this problem also tend not to work with a PowerPak.
