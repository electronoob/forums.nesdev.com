<br />Not really - ONLY NESTOPIA DON'T SUPPORT IT. Nestopia isn't "some emulators". And it doesn't support NROM with PRG-RAM either. It's kinda dumb if you ask me - it's not because no commercial games used one configuration that this said configuration doesn't exist.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's the new emulators that try to simulate actual boards, vs the ones that emulate the Mapper numbers.
<br />For instance, QuickNES seems to cap CNROM at 32k, but Nestopia does not.  For a while, FCEUX was capping CNROM to 32k as well, but that restriction was later relaxed.
<br />
<br />Many newer emulators do not allow WRAM to exist on boards where it did not traditionally exist.  So mapper 0 may no longer have WRAM, along with mapper 2, mapper 3, etc.  Some other emulators always emulate WRAM regardless of which mapper it is.
<br />
<br />The newest versions of FCEUX force "bus conflicts" by comparing the value written to ROM with the value there, this breaks some ROM hacks, such as "Mario vs Air Man".

<br />
<br />But for a good prize, maybe I'd consider it. If it would be a powerpak, I for one would suggest a cash equivalent to prize's price (and then you save on shipping) for those who already have one. I have a feeling at least a few of the people here who'd enter do. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Also I'm confused. I realize chr RAM would be allowed now, but is it still NROM only? 
<br />
<br />Luckily my current project is still NROM, but I don't think I'd enter it in a competition at the moment. I'd have to do something new.

<br />That, and the byte budget helps contestants set realistic goals for their entries. If you think you can make something as ambitious as SMB1 in the time limit, go ahead.
<br />
<br />As for taking away 8 KiB, there are a bunch of game designs that require placement of large numbers of background objects at granularity smaller than 8px: Qix, Hatris, and Blockout. The programmer can gain some of that data back using tokumaru's codec.

Would that be cool? But each winner getting a card would probably be a little.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If we set it to NROM only, we could be able to add each game to a bank of PRG-ROM on MMC1 or some othr maper, Make a program that runs from RAM from the title screen/ROM to switch to the right bank, then jump to the games program. That would be cool <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Great idea about selling copies on NA. Gbadev.org did that too, though it was easier on GBA because of the fairly easy availability of commercial Chinese-made flash carts. A collection of the top six entries would work if you can find a supply of cheap SGROM donors (see <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Board_table" class="postlink">list</a>), and you could sell a PocketNES version on the side to reach customers who have a GBA SP or DS Lite but lack a working NES.

<br />And I've already made a prototype of the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Forbidden_Four" class="postlink">MMC1 multicart menu</a> that I'll let you use. It just needs to be fixed to run from power-on instead of relying on Zelda.

<br />
<br />
<br />Yeah well that is possible right? Have a MMC1 switch program ROM from the menu to the NROM game right? If so I could program it although I haven't used mappers yet....
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />
<br />I'm sure RetroUSB has enough parts for our needs. And ROM's can be gotten offline for cheap if we buy all 40 in one lot I'm sure that'd be like $30 for the ROM'S, $9 for the board, $4 for the case, and $4 for a ciclone, and $3/label. Add $4 for the shipping of parts from RetroUSB and that equals about $23 per cart. That isn't bad. We would need to get quotes to actually get a price though....
