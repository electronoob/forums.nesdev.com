<br />
<br />- I remember of an old NES emulator with such feature, named PCNES. However, it's what Dwedit said: just take the game binary bundled with the emulator.

<br />In fact, HLEing the music would be a nice idea. The emulator's build config file could tell the emulator to patch the ROM not to play the music through the APU. Instead, it would write to a register that tells the emu to start an included .s3m, .xm, or .ogg file based on the value in A when it hits the song init code. I seem to remember a Mega Man 2-specific emu that did this, as did CD ports of cart games for the TG16 and Genesis.

<br />Yeah, I remember Bananmos and I had talked about something like that a really long time ago too.  I had forgotten about that, I also didn't know there was an emulator that does that for MM2.  It would be kinda cool if it was standardized.
