PAL specifies color recovery by using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_delay_line" class="postlink">delay line</a> of precise length and using the additive and subtractive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_%28wave_propagation%29" class="postlink">interference</a> between the current and delayed color signals, while NTSC specifies color recovery by using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop" class="postlink">PLL</a> to demodulate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation" class="postlink">QAM</a> and different bandwidths for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YIQ" class="postlink">orange-vs-blue and green-vs-purple</a> axes.<br /><br />A few modern NTSC sets add a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comb_filter" class="postlink">comb filter</a> to attempt to exchange some vertical color resolution in exchange for horizontal, but the results are harder to predict, vary more from set to set, and may sometimes be disabled for sufficiently non-standards-compliant inputs (such as from a NES). TVs that use a &quot;3d&quot; comb filter would be ludicrously difficult to drive in a predictive fashion, especially given the NES's limited palette.

There are some rare color combinations that the CRT and HDTV don't seem to agree on, IIRC one of them produced a greyish tone on my HDTV, but some actual color on my CRT. Probably a detail of how the filter is implemented.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Does anybody have a good idea how the chroma merging could be simulated in AviSynth? I guess it should be something like 1) convert to YUV (or YCbCr, strictly speaking) 2) separate the Y, U and V planes 3) scale the U and V planes by 0.5, and blend them with a shifted version of themselves 4) combine back to YUV.

	</div>Is this consistent with what you see?<br /><br />I'd also tried using a diagonal delay (the NES's scanline is too long), but I didn't really notice an appreciable difference. I guess any difference probably requires that it operate on the modulated chroma signal, not the baseband components.

That'd fix background flashing, but sprites would still have the same issue unless you locked their (display) Y position to increments of 2 as well. I don't think this would have a HUGE effect on gameplay.
