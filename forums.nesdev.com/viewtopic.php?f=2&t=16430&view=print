I bet that eats most of the 64-sprite bandwidth already (maybe they use 8x16 sprites).<br /><br />I think apart from favouring the SFC version over it, another possible reason for it not being released is manufacture cost. It's (almost) certain that the cart contains extra RAM (probably with battery backed-up portion for saving too) as the internal 2kb work RAM couldn't be enough for its random <s>destructible</s> constructible terrace. It's just not a good commercial deal to release something like this near the end of the console's life.

They did a really good job on the interface. <br /><br />The minimap/lookaround solution seems unique/visionary, even if it is derived from the problem of porting the game to a console with a feature set not designed with this type of game in mind.<br /><br />It would have fared better if flashROM had been a commercially viable thing for the NES. Apparently it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory" class="postlink">invented by a toshiba employee</a> in 1980 and made available in 1984, but must've cost a lot.

I got some very rough separation of tones and noise, and it could try to identify chords etc. but I think there's a ton of refinement work on how to detect/select/separate tones that needs to be done before it's past the basic proof of concept stage. Even Melodyne isn't really as good as the cherry-picked examples in its ads makes it look, but I was quite impressed with how far beyond it was from the basic stuff I was doing.<br /><br />Dunno if anyone's tried to make the GIMP equivalent of Melodyne yet, though it's on my list of projects that may someday become interesting enough to me to take priority again.

The MMC5 supports 2x32k (64k) at maximum.<br /><br />So I think lidnariq is either presuming this maximum 64k of WRAM (2x32k), or presuming 32k WRAM and 32k CHR-RAM (could do pattern RAM banking). I'm not sure which.<br /><br /><br /><s>SNES SimCity had 256k RAM inside it, for comparison, which could save two cities, so that might put an assumption for 64k WRAM being necessary into perspective.</s><br /><em>Edit:</em> never mind, it was 256 kilo<em>bit</em>, so 32k.

Since ETROM comes by default with 2x8K RAM, the only reason to socket them would be if they needed at least one larger RAM.<br /><br />(The picture also shows a UVEPROM for CHR-ROM)<br /><br />—<br /><br />The original DOS SimCity saves its cities in a consistently and exactly 27248 bytes, ending with the map itself stored as a 100x120 array of uint16s. Obviously they could have shrunk the world for the NES release, but ...<br /><br />I guess it they could possibly have landed on &quot;just&quot; needing 40K... but without having actually looked at the Micropolis source code, I suspect they might double-buffer the world state. And the picture shows an extremely similar SRAM in both sockets.
