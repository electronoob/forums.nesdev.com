		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />On the topic of palette swaps. I've read a few documents and came to know that palette swapping between an HUD (as long as it doesn't contain sprites) and the game portion is possible and not too hard. If minor graphical glitches are tolerated, then it won't consume too much time either.<br />However it becomes very problematic if one wants to do a palette swap within the game region e.g. splitting the game region into two blocks and use different palettes for them.<br /><br />The specific case is, I have a few blank scanlines to spend, but the protagonist's sprites still need to display correctly on these scanlines.<br />So:<br />&gt; Is it possible at all?<br />&gt; If not, any alternative solutions to make it involve least noticable graphical glitches?

A scanline IRQ (e.g. MMC3) would probably help a lot here.

Disabling rendering at the wrong time will break sprites for the rest of the field.<br /><br />Each scanline has 85px that aren't used for blitting pixels to the display; of those, 64 pixels (the eight sprite fetch periods) can be stolen without breaking background rendering. If the left or right edges of the screen are just the backdrop color you can steal a little more time.<br /><br />64px is only 21cy; if all the values you're writing can fit in A, X, and Y without loading new values, then you have exactly the amount of time to update one palette entry (6 writes * 4 cycles/write - 3 cycles for the first write being loaded in)<br /><br />—<br /><div class="quotetitle">w7n wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">a few blank scanlines to spend, but the protagonist's sprites still need to display correctly on these scanlines.<br />So:<br />&gt; Is it possible at all?<br /></div>In summary: No. But you could use a horizontal stripe of background tiles that are equivalent to your protagonist's sprite, and set the background scroll appropriately.

(Also, depending on your TV, parts of that 64-pixel &quot;blank&quot; area might actually be visible.)<br /><br />This leaves the PPU address pointing at the next background colour slot, too, so you can leave it there across the next visible scanline without any funny colours showing. ...and of course you're going to want a blank scanline after it to give you an opportunity to reload the scroll and put the renderer back in order.<br /><br />I do this in my palette display ROM: <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=13264" class="postlink">thread</a>
