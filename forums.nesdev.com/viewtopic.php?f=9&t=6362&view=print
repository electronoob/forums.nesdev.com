<br />
<br />I know a few people here have RGB modded their NES with PPU's from Playchoice PCBs.  I was wondering if anyone had a Playchoice PCB leftover without the PPU for sale?  I'm looking for the Single Monitor Version Playchoice PCB.  The Single Monitor Version has 2 edge connectors on the PCB.  If you have one you'd like to get rid of send me a PM please.  Don't need the CPU either if that is an issue as well.

I'd be more than happy to sell it to a collector who'd play it in a cab.  I'd even be willing to solder a 40 pin ic socket onto where the ppu goes.  However if you're only interested in the single moniter version all I can do is with you the best of luck.

<br />
<br />Yeah, they do. In fact, they differ from each-other, as I recall, so that game vendors couldn't burn new ROMs to upodate cabinets when a new game came out. 
<br />
<br />That is, Vs. SMB has a different colour palatte to Vs. Ie Climber and the like. There may be a Vs. game that shares the colour palatte with the NES PPU, however I am unsure about this.

<br />Vs. Duck Hunt uses a palette very close to the NES one. I guess requiring Zapper light guns was enough copy protection.

<br />according to this tennis uses the same ppu as duck hunt.  Unless tennis uses a custom controller I don't think your theory applies

<br />
<br />I'd bet the control panel is wired differently when the gun is installed, I'm not sure though.  You definitely couldn't have a lightgun and 2 controllers at the same time, at least not using the "usual" way that the NES system uses.
<br />
<br />The Duck Hunt kit obviously had to include a wiring harness of some type for the gun.

<br />if you're outside of the US try contacting the seller and seeing if he/she would be willing to ship outside of the states

<br />however like most pc pcbs I come across it's listed as "untested" so you'd be taking a slight risk

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks.  I already have one, but was hoping to pick up a backup main board for a bit cheaper although I may bid on that one.  I was hoping to find someone with a PCB they robbed the PPU from.  I've got a load of PPUs and don't really need that part.  BTW, the PPU is already socketed so no need to solder in a socket.  
<br />
<br />EDIT: Just looked at the EBAY ad again.  It is a Dual Monitor Board not a Single Monitor Board.
<br />
<br />For those wondering about the gun and Duck Hunt, IIRC, the gun takes the position of player 2.  I believe there is also a check on another bit that detects if the gun is there.  If it is not, the Vs. games makes an annoying "alarm" sound.  There is what I will call a rumor that Vs. Duck Hunt also comes in a different version that uses a different PPU, but I haven't seen proof of that yet.
<br />
<br />Vs. Tennis requires 2 PPUs.  The Vs board has basically 2 NES systems on it and Vs. Tennis requires both NES systems to run.

<br />
<br />Hmm... Actually, I've seen that before: The Famicombox, which is based on the NES hardware, has two controllers and the Zapper wired at one time. 
<br />
<br />Somehow I figure that Tennis <em>was its own </em>copy-protection. 
<br />
<br />I thought that Vs. Duck Hunt was in the lot of PPUs that can be used in the NES with minimum colour shifting, but I wasn't certain... Good to know that Tennis is as well, as it's probably a very cheap board.

<br />
<br />Would it be possible to bridge both monitor signals into one wiring harness to connect to one CRT from a dual-monitor board?
<br />
<br />There is a great PC-10 system loaded with games on ebay now for $300... I'd love to buy it, but it is local pickup only in Indiana.
