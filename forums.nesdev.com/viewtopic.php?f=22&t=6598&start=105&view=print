If it happens to come downloadable in future (even if not when it is first released) then I may download it but believe me I don't mind paying the normal price for the game. But I don't want a cartridge I want a .NES file which can be played on the computer.
<br />
<br />Perhaps that is what you can do, you can sell the computer file too (in addition to the cartridge) after the game has been sold already for a while, after some amount of time?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There's actually a cheaper option which I forgot to mention, and Memblers promotes it whenever it comes up: using the PRG or CHR EEPROM itself for save games. Cost: free if CHR, 6Â¢ for a 741g14 if PRG (unless you find one where nWR overrides nRD). Downsides: screwing it up damages or bricks the game; an EEPROM with sector erase is required; EEPROM isn't available for reading during erase or write so if PRG, save game writing routine must be copied to internal RAM first and if CHR, video must be disabled during erase.

<br />You really can do it? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> 
<br />Wow, would be great. But..I'm not sure about it. To be honest, in countries like mine, I'm not sure if the game sells very well. I'll buy it, but piracy is often more choosen option. I don't want bunnyboy or you to lose money on making cart that won't sell.
<br />About compabibility, I'v never heard about not working famicom game with pegasus. And my famicom games(Kirby, SMB3, Rockman3 and few more) are working perfectly.

<br />
<br />Personally, I think a ROM release that can be purchased via paypal would be more effective at getting it into the hands of people that want to pay for it than another physical release in an even more obscure format, but... well, I'm sure Sivak has thought hard about how he wants to release his game already.

<br />
<br />And you only need to buy one adapter to play <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/index.php?cPath=30" class="postlink">all these</a>. This includes Nomolos and both Battle Kids.

<br />
<br />I strongly recommend the more traditional approach:
<br />Start:  brings up the menu
<br />Select:  does a straight up pause
<br />(a la, Zelda)
<br />
<br />
<br />Unless you have other plans for Select in-game...
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Also the character art is amazing.  A big improvement from BK1.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I like it, like the options and everything in it, but don't like how you can't leave the options menu with the start button. When you get into a menu with a button, you need to exit with that button to keep a logical flow of button assignments to the person playing the game. Bad design, but it's not too much of a game killer. That 1 pixel wide font on the other hand, is. I know I've commented on it a ton, but it's nearly impossible to read on a TV.

<br />
<br />What's the LE version?  I'm guessing Limited Edition to some degree?  Any word on what to expect for differences?
<br />
<br />Finally got a chance to check out the updated demo, the characters are pretty BA.  Too bad Timmy hasn't gotten a hair cut since the last game. Kids these days...
<br />
<br />Unfortunately I'd have to agree the start-&gt;select-&gt;B-&gt;start button combo to get in and out of the menu does throw me off a bit.  That said, I'm still racking my brain over the MM3 menu system.
<br />
<br />In any event like everyone else I'll be here waiting with bated breath for the release.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The LE version is a special edition that has a numbered cart, ROM, and case.  May or may not do numbered manuals this time.  They mainly go out to significant contributors or friends, but those that are left over are put into a pool where folks can enter and if their name is drawn, they are admitted, but they still have to pay for the thing.
<br />
<br />I guess regarding the menu system...  I had some difficulties when programming it and the paused method was just more convenient to do.  I'm not going to attempt a rewrite at this phase.  All I can say is you will get used it and players won't likely use it a whole lot.  It's not like Mega Man where you switch weapons constantly.  That's about all I can really say about it...
