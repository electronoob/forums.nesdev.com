I know it can be frustrating looking into something else if what you really want is to make NES games. But a person will hardly be able to program a complete game without any previous programming experience. The documents out there will explain how the hardware works, and also some small pieces of code, but that's just 1% of what making a game is.<br /><br />I know what I know about game logic today because I started writing crappy QBasic games back in 1996. QBasic was a very simple way to make a game, it was simple to experiment with, while 6502 ASM and the NES sure are not.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I'm not saying 6502 is a good starting point, I'm just saying it's a plus if you're planning to be a better programmer...<br /></div><br />I agree that every programmer should have some contact with some form of assembly language, even if just to understand better how computers work.<br /><br />But working with high level languages greatly improve your programming skills, because you learn to program by obeying rules and making much better structured programs. Object-oriented programming is also a great concept for games. And those concepts can sure be applied to assembly programs, so that they're more well structured too.<br /><br />So yeah, everyone can try. And I'm very happy to hear the stories of you guys that were able to get into programming with the NES, you prove that it's possible.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Nov 21, 2007 9:47 pm</p><hr />
