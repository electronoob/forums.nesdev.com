<br />
<br />What version of the software are you using?
<br />
<br />Did you set the jumpers and switches correctly (using the sheet that came with the programmer and the information os screen)?
<br />
<br />Did you select your chip in the software?
<br />
<br />Does the software read back the chip and verifies that the data was programmed successfully? Mine does this after every write.
<br />
<br />I'd guess it's not programming correctly. Please tell us how you set everything up and how you're using the software.
<br />
<br />Now, if the software verifies the chip and it programmed OK, the problem is in the cart.
<br />
<br />In order for us to debug this, you have to tell us exactly what you're doing.

<br />Nrom board 128
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I am using EPROM35 program

<br />I  choosed Eprom 27c256 in the menu
<br />
<br />I hit load (chr ) or (prg)
<br />then hit program chip then it goes to 100% &amp; verifys...
<br />this is what i did
<br />
<br />The Schema for the DIP are in the software i did place them like in the Image
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />but i did try to ''burn it several time after it didn't work.....'' but each time it says it's ok .... (but isn't there a stop in a number of time i can burn it?..........)
<br />seems like i can burn it for ever.

<br />I don't think this is enough to make sure that the cart is ok.
<br />
<br />What happened to the original excitebike? Did you damage the chips that bad that you can't try to use them somehow? At least the PRG chip, because even if the graphics are wrong, you'll be able to see that the game is running. Don't you have any other NROM cart you're willing to remove the chips? Just to test, and if you're careful, you can even return the chip later.
<br />
<br />You gotta be patient to identify where the problem is. If you have no means of checking the contacts on the cart (one by one with a multimeter, or with some original game chips) it will be hard to tell where the problem is.
<br />
<br />Maybe you could try posting a few screenshots of what you're doing with the software...?

<br />
<br />I know how to make work a nes in 1 shot normally all my games work in 1 try....

<br />
<br />then i retryed puttin the Excitebike chips onto it's board i just pulled them from without soldering.........
<br />Get the same grey Screen.........HUh?...
<br />Even if they are not soldered the contact is suposed to be 'done''
<br />
<br />I am somewhat confused....
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />On my Dev cart i did damage 2 pin when i badly soldered the wire to the bad pin when unsoldered
<br />the GOLD color Turned into Silver ''metal like color''
<br />but i don't think it would cut the transmission?
<br />Gold to silver = not working?... i really dunno...
<br />
<br />
<br />besides that my socket legs aren't soldered together so no bridge or interference there....

<br />With the chip pluged in, check for contact of each leg with the correspondent pin on the cart edge. Use that diagram of the NES connector and check if all the address and data lines are successfully connected to the chip. But really, check the chip itself, not the socket or the ball of solder under the board.
<br />
<br />If each leg successfully reaches the cart edge, I can't see what's wrong. If any doesn't, you'll find where the problem is. Take some time to verify all the pins.

<br />with the pcb...

<br />&amp; also near where the socket legs are coming out the ''top part doesn't have any trace at all
<br />the bottom is the most carefull since you have the trace that goes to the pins... wich i taped all around so i didn't get any suprise this time....
<br />
<br />I really dunno what i did wrong..
<br />
<br />Maybe it's a lack of solder......
<br />but that wouldn't make sens since they are in socket &amp; it's hard as steel &amp; the chips are pushed like to the point of never coming out (figure of speech)

<br />
<br />Im gonna post pics of my work ..
<br />
<br />PS:
<br />i found out that my Socket legs doesn't have all ''solder to the circle some do some dont like the solder didn't pass from the bottom to Up ....
<br />
<br />i don't know if it would affect it .. if yes tomorrow i will Put more solder until it fills the Complete hole... up the the socket...
