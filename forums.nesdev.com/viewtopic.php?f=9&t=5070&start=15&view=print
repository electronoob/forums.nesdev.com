This happens on my console with UA6561!<br />The bugs on title screen of Battle Toads and Double Dragon are also true.<br /><br />In the contrary, the Asterix game, which is really buggy on NES works pefect on PEGASUS.</div>
<br />
<br />Can you clarify which Dizzy game you're talking about?  There's three Dizzy games on the NES: "Fantastic Adventures of Dizzy", "Dizzy the Adventurer" and Quattro Adventure's "Treasure Island Dizzy".  Sounds like you're most likely referring to "Fantastic Adventures of Dizzy".
<br />
<br />Codemasters put region detection into their games, so when the game is run on an official NTSC or PAL NES, it detects which model it is, and adjusts the timed code appropriately.  But this fails on clone hardware that doesn't use the same timing, so it might think it's running on an original PAL NES when it isn't.
<br />
<br />When I try the Dizzy games on Nintendulator in Dendy mode, they use the wrong timing (they think they're running on a PAL NES), but seem to work well enough.  They don't crash when you pause or die.
<br />And Asterix fails in Nintendulator when running in Dendy mode.  Since Dendy Mode is simulating a long pre-vblank time, and a short vblank time.  Asterix still thinks it's running on a PAL NES, and does all its long graphics transfers during the short vblank time, which fails.
<br />So if the clone console runs Asterix correctly, it has completely different rules regarding Vblank time than the Dendy.  I'm not sure whether it counts as a Dendy clone or not.
<br />
<br />I could probably guess what the timing rules are from screenshots or videos showing some glitches.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think I've seen one these hybrid consoles here.<br /><br />UA6527 is a NTSC CPU chip which needs 21Mhz to work properly. A console using it combined with a PAL PPU will need two crystals, one for each part. Because I needed the one I had here to be NTSC (well I wanted it to be PAL-M but that's an 60hz PAL system).<br /><br />I had the UA6538 chip replaced with a UA6548 (The UMC chip which is specific for 60Hz PAL-M TV system used in Brazil) and removed the 26mhz oscillator. I kept the UA6527 chip and had both chips run from 21Mhz. That effectively made it into a NTSC like clone.<br /><br /><br />Sadly it's been more than 10 years now I've done that I don't remember the details.

UA6527 uses 26MHz as masterclock and internal divider by 15 (not 12 as in pure NTSC chip).</div><br /><br />Funny I have a lot of them here (from asian clones) and they used UA6527 + UA6528. These run from 21mhz clock and behave as Famicom (duty cycle bug apply and DPCM sucks if the chip is made before 1990) ...<br /><br />Here, UMC chips were more common than the Korean TA-02/TA-03 pair of chips.<br />I don't have a working camera atm but I am 100000% sure the UA6527 is a NTSC chip and requires 21mhz to operate.<br /><br />After writing half of this post I looked on the internet and found this picture which was enlightening :<br /><img src="http://blog-imgs-34.fc2.com/g/x/e/gxemu/bit70-06.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Notice the &quot;P&quot; after the code of the chip. Perhaps that's why we were so strong on our arguments ? I never ever seen a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">UA6527P</span></strong> chip here. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />My chips look exactly like that but they're missing the &quot;P&quot; from their code. And the only PAL &quot;Dendy-like&quot; PPU I have here (UMC 2A02E) has the newer &quot;UMC&quot; logo in it (similar to the logo on the NOAC QFP chip) the PAL &quot;Dendy-like&quot; CPU (2A03E) has &quot;USC&quot; printed on it but is obviously an UMC part as well.<br /><br />The PAL UMC chips I have are exactly what you described, by the way.

It has 8bit CD port (Color Data?). The result dot color index goes from CD port to SECAM coder UM6559. Notice that PPU in DIP48 in order to have enough pins. And this clone has pallete issues. For example look at Spiderman screenshots (SECAM on left):<br /><a href="http://savepic.net/2117765.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://savepic.net/2117765m.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><a href="http://savepic.net/2112661.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://savepic.net/2112661m.png" alt="Image" /></a>
