<br />
<br />I'm only having one little issue and that's with saving my game.  I have two folders on the SD card.  One is ED64 and it seems to contain the save files in a subfolder of it.  The second folder I have contains my actual games.  I can see in the saves folder that savefiles have been created for games like Ocarina of Time, but when I load up the game my save data does not appear to be present.
<br />
<br />Perhaps I have my saves in the wrong folder?  I tried pressing RESET after saving as someone suggested, but no dice.  I'm sure this is a very simple procedure but I'm not having much luck.  Any tips?
<br />
<br />Thanks a lot, guys!  I really appreciate how helpful folks are here  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />There isn't any more to it, save in the game and then press reset once, wait for the menu to appear and then either play something else or close the console...

<br />are you sure that you are actually saving? don't get me wrong but in Zelda it's not enough to enter your name, you need to actually save afterwards in game... maybe when testing you did not save afterwards?

<br />
<br />Zelda: Ocarina of Time, however, saves as an sra file (SRAM).  It creates the file just fine but doesn't appear to save anything to it or be able to load from it.  I can force it to save as another save type, but then the game glitches after Link leaves his house for the first time.
<br />
<br />I'd really like to know how to get around this issue so I can save my progress  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />
<br />I'll keep trying later, for now I need a break from the unskippable intro  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> 
<br />
<br />To double check, what save type is your file in?  Mine tries SRAM.  Is that what yours is?  Also, is there something I need to do at game startup to select the save file?  The other games I have tried work fine, but none of them are sra saves, they are all eep.

<br />you enter your name, see the long intro  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />  and then pressing start you bring up the game's menu and you save... reset the console and presto!
<br />Then all you have to do when you load the game again is to select your character's save from the 3 that the game lets you and it works... 
<br />
<br />the cart creates a 32kb .sra file located here for me:
<br />/ED64/SAVE/Legend of Zelda, The - Ocarina of Time (U) (V1.2) [!].sra
<br />
<br />maybe you can test with another FAT32 formatted SD card? it could be some rare incompatibility bug or something...

<br />I seem to having the same issue with ANY game that uses sram to save.  Weird.  Anyone else come across this or know a fix?  Maybe I need some sort of dummy sram file first like I do with my PowerPak?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello!  You've been very helpful in my quest to get Zelda saving.  Thank you!  I'm still having issues no matter what I try.  I was able to get a gold of the rom you mentioned and the issue still repeats itself.  It may be helpful if we exchange different info.
<br />
<br />I am using a SanDisk 4gb 30mb/s class 10 SDHC card.  I also bring up the following info on the ED64 main menu when I pull the Z trigger to get info:
<br />
<br />Firmware 2.2.3
<br />OS 1.2.7
<br />SD interface 4 bit
<br />System Type NTSC
<br />Assembly date 9.7.2012
<br />
<br />If my info matches yours (other than assembly date) it might be an issue for the creator of the cart to address.  I've tried two different cards, both re-formatted to FAT32.
<br />
<br />I hope this info helps!  Thanks again!
