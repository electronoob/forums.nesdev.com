<br />Actually, I would suggest you check this up. Both Memblers's EPROM emulator and the one I built myself have had weird electrical problems giving garbage sprites on an NTSC system. (mine still does) So even if the chance of anything screwing up is insignificant, it's better to be safe than sorry.
<br />
<br />And needless to say, you can sign me up on the waiting list as well. :)

The NTSC PPU runs slightly faster than the PAL one (5.37 MHz vs. 5.32 MHz).
<br />
<br />That said, I do agree that PAL testing should be done before selling internationally, if possible.  There are a number of things that can potentially go wrong due to hardware differences (make sure the flash card is still read properly, make sure PPU rendering remains accurate and that IRQ's are triggered as they should, make sure the Ciclones work as advertised, and so forth).

<br />If there would be minor IRQ and/or Ciclones problems on a PAL console, I'd definitely buy anyway. But if there would be significant problems, that would sucks very badly.
<br />
<br />About the battery backup, this means that you have to save normally, then leave your sit, press reset, then the menu will be able to backup the WRAM to the flash card ? That's decent I think, but how do you detect resets ? Does the FPGA check for M2 being tree-states, and enable the BIOS back if it is ?

You save within the game, press Reset, then tell the PowerPak to save WRAM to the flash card.  The WRAM isn't battery backed, so you have to save to the flash card or else lose the saved data.
<br />
<br />There are a couple of different ways to detect resets.  You can monitor Phi-2, or you can monitor PRG A0 (I remember hearing about a cart that used this technique - it works because during CPU execution A0 never stays constant for more than a few cycles).  I might point out that a number of mappers require certain registers to be re-initialized upon reset, so even if the BIOS weren't swapped back in, the FPGA would still need to know when a reset occurs for those mappers.

<br />Nintendo mappers initialize their internal registers when they detect the supply voltage is rising on power-up, but my undestanding is that they are not affected by hardware resets at all I'm talking about the Nintendo's MMC chips. I don't know about the other ASICs.

Yes I will post to this forum first.  May have to release in smaller batches so it isn't super backed up.
<br />
<br />Reset is detected by watching M2 compared to an on board clock.  Can't watch for reset vector because starting the game needs that too, and some games will read that location when its bank swapped to something else.
<br />
<br />Just to keep the hoax going, here is an obviously photoshopped photo of the final plastics:  <a href="http://www.nespowerpak.com/redpowerpak.jpg" class="postlink">http://www.nespowerpak.com/redpowerpak.jpg</a> (yes it is real)  The CF slot is cnc milled, doesn't look like hand held dremel.  Don't have final labels yet but the test ones are very water resistant, acid free, etc.  Rubbing while under faucet did nothing  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Don't have final manuals yet either, still testing color laser paper.  Both the high quality labels and manuals will be on all my future products so contact me if you want your homebrew game produced.

<br />I'm fairly sure the MMC5 detects resets.  Its upper ROM bank, according to the info I have, is mapped to the last bank of ROM on power-up AND on reset, even though the bank is switchable.  It's also my understanding that the MMC5 (and possibly the MMC3/MMC6) will disable WRAM upon reset.  The Nintendo World Championship cart also detects reset, but I believe it gets its reset signal from the lockout chip.
<br />
<br />There are also some pirate mappers that use a reset trigger to select which game to play (i.e. you get a different game each time you hit reset).  I do not know if these games can be supported on the PowerPak, nor do I care since they are pirated games in the first place.

<br />Actually they disable it on power-up, because I see no reason for the WRAM to be corrupted when the system is reseting itself, but I do for when the power goes up and down.
<br />
<br />For the MMC5, mabe you're right, I have no idea about it.
