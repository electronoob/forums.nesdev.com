<br />Perhaps the closest comparison I can think of is a Z80 (lots of general-purpose registers, lots of Internal Operation cycles). The eight 16-bit registers can be thought of as four accumulators, X, Y, S, and PC. (Yes, PC is one of the numbered general-purpose registers, just as on ARM.)

I have never seen one in person (I don't think it was even sold here officially), and from what I've seen online the games are not particularly interesting. I mean, it's interesting just for being a game console, but not "I want to code for it" interesting.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">3gengames wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Just from reading these posts it seems like some people want to program a 6809/6309 or even 68000 microprocessor.</div>
<br />The Genesis/MD does interest me a lot, so yeah, I do want to program for the 68000 some day. And from what I understand you can even use the 68000 for music (like we use the CPU for music on the NES), you're not required to use the Z80. I would like to practice more Z80 though.

<br />
<br />I guess this is what you have to do to set some bits in memory:
<br />
<br />load register from memory
<br />load other register with precomplemented mask
<br />AND data register with mask register
<br />complement mask register
<br />XOR data register with mask register
<br />store register to memory
<br />
<br />considering each one of those instructions is 6-10 cycles, that's REALLY slow. The 6502 at the same clock rate should be faster for just about any algorithm.
<br />
<br />
<br />The 68k is easy to program, and powerful, but after trying to emulate it, I'm just not much of a fan. It has really obnoxious instruction encoding, and I was a little let down due to its reputation as being so elegant.

<br />Neo Geo primarily, but the plan is for it to become multi-system like MAME/MESS (+computers).

<br />
<br />The 68000 only takes 8 cycles to load a VDP register with a value!
<br />
<br />MOVE.W registerthatjustsohappenstohavetheneededvalue, (addressregsiterthatjustsohappenstohavetheneededdestinationaddress)

<br />
<br />sta $2007 ; A happens to hold the value, instruction encodes the address to write to PPU
<br />
<br />or also 8 for the 8086 when the VDP is port mapped:
<br />
<br />out dx, ax ; AX happens to hold the value, DX happens to hold the port
<br />
<br />One cool thing about the 68K is how easily you can maintain multiple stacks with the (A#)+ and -(A#) addressing modes. I kind of like the CP1610's approach better though forcing the SP to predecrement/postincrement on indirect writes/reads.
