On machines that only output composite video, it's partly because composite video is equivalent to phone-quality audio, whereas RCA can be equivalent to between S-Video and RGB quality (significant video noise on audio is due to design quality, not an inherent limitation of RCA audio). On RF-only machines, people have done more audio mods to get line out.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> I'll admit, at first the only thing I noticed was digital was a little louder. But after listening to a few different things, the difference is definitely there. And I don't have the greatest setup in the world. Not that there was a &quot;problem&quot; with the SNES audio, but digital is just better. Everything is a little more clear. Highs and lows, especially lows, now appear to be muffled on analog. While listening to music from games, there's more separation between parts (I guess you could just say it's more clear), and overall there's better stereo separation. </div><br />Could you have achieved the same with an equalizer, upping the sliders on the low and high end? I bet if you put one in, you could make this digital signal sound even better. I'm skeptical about better stereo separation.

So not hearing it as sounding better isn't an indication of poor hearing skills, it's just an indication of different subjective preference.

It's an actual improvement. The highs and lows are not simply louder. I don't know a great deal about this stuff, but it is my understanding that signal degradation and inference will cause the highest and lowest frequencies to be effected first and possibly lost. The digital audio output will remain intact, at least from the SNES to the receiver, so it wont suffer from signal loss and interference like analog will. For that reason, the highs and lows are just better quality. And possibly, the highest highs and lowest lows are present whereas they are missing in analog. If you boosted the highs and lows on the analog output, it would probably sound worse. Being that the high and lows are effected by interference, boosting them will just be boosting the frequencies most effected by interference. Furthermore, boosting just the highs and lows gives you that generic &quot;club&quot; smiley face EQ that I don't care for at all. It's not the way anything should be EQ'ed IMO.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">blargg wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The digital audio isn't objectively better; it's different, which some people prefer. So not hearing it as sounding better isn't an indication of poor hearing skills, it's just an indication of different subjective preference.</div><br /><br />Well again, SkinnyV was listening to Drakon's samples, where the digital audio was converted to analog before the recording. It's not at all a true test of what the digital audio sounds like. <br /><br />I would argue that the SNES digital audio <em>is</em> better, and not just different. Now I almost wanna get an S/PDIF input for my PC. If I had one, I could record samples of both and analyze them for a true evaluation.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The only difference I've heard between the two Youtube videos is that the &quot;stock&quot; circuit sounds like it has some kind of filter on higher frequenices (maybe a low-pass filter?) -- the result is that the audio sounds &quot;dampened&quot;.  The new/modded circuit appears to have none of that -- or if it does, it's configured/tuned to be less severe.  But this is not an effective way for me to conclude anything, because the audio on Youtube is highly compressed (regardless if 480p, 720p, or 1080p) and lossy.<br /><br />There are also folks here on this forum who have written audio emulation libraries and are quite familiar with waveform analysis who can provide a full explanation of what's truly different, but only if good, clean, lossless recordings are given.<br /><br />So again, politely, please stop using Youtube for this -- give us 44kHz 16-bit stereo .WAV files (you can compress them with zip/rar, which are lossless), preferably of a game that has good range and that folks are familiar with and can compare against existing games (I mentioned Actraiser for a reason).  You can upload them here on the forum as long as they're smaller than 4MBytes.  If you can upload audio to Youtube, then you obviously have the audio in a digital format (I do not care if it's &quot;recorded onto an analog device&quot; or &quot;going through analog cables&quot; (i.e. RCA or 1/8&quot; stereo jacks) as long as both the &quot;stock&quot; output AND the new/modded circuit output are recorded via the same cables/means).  So please provide what you have!  :/

I would think, no, there isn't. And if there is, it would just be a very, very small improvement in clarity. Or am I wrong?</div><br />It's nice to have them separated because a lot of people out there like it that way.  I personally don't use it but all my clients always say how happy they are with it.<br /><br />The reason why I prefer this new analog circuit is because I hear a little more range of audio that used to be muffled out.  With the snes going to spdif and then back to analog you can hear more highs (and probably more lows), there's just less muffle, it could be better but any improvement makes me happy.  The whole point of doing this was to prove that even converting the digital audio back into analog using a cheap ebay converter and then filtered through youtube still sounds better than the regular analog.<br /><br />As for high quality recordings I'm not sure this mod is a big enough improvement to bother putting it under that large of a microscope.  Also the spc players on my snes powerpak doesn't like the actraiser spc files.
