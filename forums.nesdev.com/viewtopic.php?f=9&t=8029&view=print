		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is there any method to the first character of board names? I know the first character specifies the mapper, and the second generally specifies the expected size of ROM or RAM. A few make a bit of sense: 'C' for CHR switch (CNROM or CPROM), 'P' for Punch-Out!!, and 'F' for Fire Emblem. But what about the rest?
<br />'U' for 16 KiB PRG switch, 'B' for 32 KiB PRG switch, 'A' for 32 KiB PRG switch and 1-screen mirroring, 'S' for MMC1, 'T' for MMC3, 'E' for MMC5, 'H' for MMC6...
<br />
<br /><a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=711" class="postlink">Spot is SNROM</a>. I thought it'd be UNROM seeing as it's about <a href="http://www.retrojunk.com/details_commercial/1480/" class="postlink">the Uncola</a>. But I guess it needs the PRG RAM for something.

<br />
<br />You mean 2nd letter? The 1st letter always gives away what hardware mapper it uses. The 2nd for each varies and just tells of the extra stuff the board has. I believe SNROM would be TKROM in MMC3, with 8K WRAM [I hope] on both. Kinda weird, I with the 2nd letters meant something for all, but remembering them all isn't that hard anyway.

<br />
<br />No I realize the first letter means what mapper of course.  He was asking more about where the letter came from.  Like how Punchout is PNROM.  I was just guessing there isn't much to the choice of which letter to use.  
<br />
<br />They "needed" to pick a letter.  They could have needed a letter for MMC1 and they thought of it as "super" at the time, so they picked "S" for lack of a better reason.

<br />SNROM has CHR RAM and PRG RAM. TNROM (Famicom only) also has CHR RAM and PRG RAM. <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/TxROM" class="postlink">TKROM has PRG ROM</a>.

<br />
<br />Ahh, okay, I was a little off. So I guess the 2nd letter also keeps more together through variants than I thought.

<br />I guess we already went multiple times to the conclusion there was absolutely no sense behind those names, and if there is any it's impossible for us to tell.
<br />
<br />I doubt there is any relation between the 'F' of Fire Emblem and FKROM, this is pure coincidence.
<br />Even the game's codes does not make sense according to the game's name half of the time.
<br />I mean NES-XU for Mega Man 3 ??
