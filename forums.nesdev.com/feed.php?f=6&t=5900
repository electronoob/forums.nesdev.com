I'd assume it's that one, cause it's the one i find most confusing.)<br /></div><br /><br />This is guaranteed to be a rambling post, so be warned...<br /><br />I said random, but it's not *truly* random because it creates a sequence that will eventually repeat. That repetition is what gives the NES and Atari "pitched" noise sounds. As the shift register gets longer so does the sequence, until a long enough sequence sounds like pure white noise. <br /><br />The thing is, current synthesis is all resource-intensive DSP. When arcades needed soundchips, they didn't have all the memory and processing power available that we do now. These days it is about optimizing software methods for sound generation. Back then, it was about getting the most mileage out of simple logic circuits and transistors. Even though the circuits are "digital" in the sense of being logic-based, there are things going on that can't be copied directly in the modern software world. <br /><br />I noticed from another post that you seem to be trying to emulate 2A03 sounds in software. One of the main issues you will run into, if you haven't already, is that you will have all kinds of aliasing problems if you generate these waveforms the naive way. <br /><br />Say you want to make a square wave. The naive way would be to make something that switches between high and low values instantly, making a pattern like this with the samples (values are arbitrary):<br /><br />-500<br />1000<br />-500<br />1000<br />...<br /><br />or an octave lower:<br />-500<br />-500<br />1000<br />1000<br />-500<br />-500<br />1000<br />1000<br /><br />There are two big problems with this right away. First, the frequency will only be accurate when it is an integer division of the sample rate. If that's not the case then jitter will occur.<br /><br />Suppose that's good enough, though, and non-integer-division frequencies are lame anyway. That naive square wave is easy to code and will look perfect on the screen, but it will not sound good compared to an actual 2A03 square wave. The problem is that instantaneous switching requires an *infinite* frequency response. If you look up the frequency spectrum of a square wave, you'll see a fundamental frequency plus harmonics that extend far off into the distance. That is what you get in the hardware world, though the very high frequency harmonics will roll off because circuits can only change so quickly...<br /><br />Back in the software domain, though, we don't have infinite frequency response. We know that whatever our sample rate is, no frequencies greater than half that will be recreated properly. In fact, any frequencies higher will fold back down as new erroneous frequencies! By creating a square wave with the "naive" method, that is exactly what happens. All the harmonics of the square wave that occur naturally will become errors if they are greater than half the sample rate. What's even worse, since we are in the pristine digital domain, we get as many harmonics as mathematically possible! Even though higher and higher harmonics are eventually rolled off enough to be below the noise floor, there will be a whole lot of garbage piling up until then. <br /><br />We really want a square wave that is 100% accurate as far as the frequency response of the digital system can get us. So how can we make a square wave with only frequencies less than half the sample rate? <br /><br />This is where band-limited impulse trains (BLIT) work wonders. They use very simple signals (mainly a sinc function) and some relatively simple calculus concepts to create square waves (among other waves) that don't alias. If you're looking to emulate hardware, this is really the place to start. <br /><br />Hopefully I'm somewhat correct in guessing what you are trying to do. If not, the rambling was still fun.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3470">skrasms</a> — Sun Jan 10, 2010 1:50 am</p><hr />

Given how you asked your question, it sounds like you're thinking in terms of PCM audio. It's a little bit different when talking about what the 2A03 does.<br /><br />Take the triangle wave, for example. It does not have a constant sample rate. It has a constant set of values that get read back at different sample rates to produce different pitches. A modern digital synthesizer would have a constant sample rate and "resample" the triangle wave data instead (or use entirely different methods). <br /><br />As a more confusing example, the noise generator is only 1 bit. However, it goes through a 4-bit DAC to allow amplitude adjustment. So the quietest noise wave will switch between 0 and 1, while the loudest will switch between 0 and 15. The 1-bit sequence comes from a linear feedback shift register, which was (and still is) a simple way of random number generation in hardware. <br /><br />Then there's the DMC channel. The sample rate here depends on if you are using DPCM or PCM. Direct writes to the 7-bit DAC can be done through register $4011,  meaning the sample rate will depend entirely on how quickly your code handles those writes. On the other hand, using DPCM there are preset sample rates. I seem to remember DPCM only exercising 6 actual bits from the DAC here, but I could be incorrect. <br /><br />Then of course it all the channels add together in a non-linear way. There's a lot of reading to do if you really want all the details.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3470">skrasms</a> — Sat Jan 09, 2010 7:05 pm</p><hr />

hello can someone please tell me the bit-depth and sample-rates of each individual channel? thanks. oh also, since it all comes out on the same output, would that mean it's all output and the same depth and rate anyway? well if it were at a lower rate and depth it would still keep its characteristics, so it's still important to know, right?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3406">Laserbeak43</a> — Sun Jan 03, 2010 4:44 pm</p><hr />
