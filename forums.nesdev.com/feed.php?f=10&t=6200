Hi! Welcome to this forum! People here are all kind and surely you'll find lots of help in your projects!<br /><br />I feel exactly like you. I'm very interested in learn about NES programming, and have a project for a game in my mind, but I really don't know if  I can. I have no knowledge in programming, and don't have enough time to spend on the amazing tutos here. I hope to learn it in homeophatic levels, but I know it'll take time...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Orsi wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Well to wrap it up now, I've been absolutely seduced by the prospect of writing little NES games for myself. For the past week I've been devouring any tutorial I can get my hands on to learn how to understand 6502, Assembly, the NES architecture, the PPU and iNES headers. The real motivation though is knowing that making a NES game is actually <em>possible</em>. When I see Pong, or Tetris, or even Super Mario Bros I think, "man, with a little time and energy, I could probably make a game that looks and plays just as good." No more over-inflated expectations about making the 'perfect' game with crazy graphics, beautiful orchestrated soundtrack, complicated plot and intricate skill systems. Sometimes the simplest games are the funnest to play.<br /></div><br /><br />That's my goal too. I started a thread right below, in order for people to indicate the best way of learning the think from scratch.<br /><br />Good luck for us! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=136">NES virus</a> — Mon Mar 22, 2010 8:19 pm</p><hr />

Welcome to the forum! This is quite easily one of the best hobby programming forums in the world. I've participated on other forums in the past, and most of them were just riddled with bad behavior. You get the occasional bad apple here but it is very rare. Most people here are extremely knowledgeable, helpful and polite.<br /><br />For me, I started with game boy, then got a super nintendo, and then finally got a NES, I think somewhere between '93 and '95, brand new from KB Toy and Hobby. I guess they still had a few after the system went out of production. I only ever got 6 games for it, but it and the Super NES were my favorite consoles.<br /><br />Later on I learned a little programming in BASIC, C, and x86, then went to college, and now I somehow have a job as a programmer. Now that I don't have to do homework anymore, I got back into hobby programming. A little over a year ago it just hit me that modern games are terrible, and I started collecting NES games and playing them.  Then a co worker told me about Bob Rost and the class he had taught at CMU about making NES games and I found my way here, either from there or via google I forget which.<br /><br />But yeah, old games are amazing. Particularly the music, and the challenge.I love music, too, and writing music, and there's such a wealth of amazing music for the NES. Plus, it is the only console for which homebrew is possible that has such a nice music editor, famitracker, available. *edit*...that I know of....<br /><br />@Motzilla: What's wrong with the famitracker driver?

Hello!<br /><br />The NES has always been my favorite console; As a kid, I used to draw up levels and "design games" for it.  I found this site a long while ago, but it was a little too hardcore for me, at the time, so I fooled around with some atari stuff, made a little demo for the dreamcast that I never released and then promptly forgot about programming.<br /><br />Then, for some reason, I ended up finding this site again.  Now, especially with the wiki, programming a NES game seems pretty doable for me, so I'm diving in head first.  I've even got some stuff running (on a real NES!).  I'm working on some tools right now, so I can make an empty level and work on the physics and control so they are perfect.<br /><br />I <em>am</em> a pretty crappy programmer, though, so I don't know how much I'll be able to help other people.  Maybe so they don't repeat my mistakes?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4250">Ian A</a> — Mon Mar 22, 2010 6:22 am</p><hr />
