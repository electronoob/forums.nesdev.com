<br />
<br />Pulling chips from existing carts will likely be the cheapest/best for a while because you get the case too.  Once there are enough good games to produce then fabricating cases might be reasonable like Atari homebrew.  Quick estimate would be ~$5-10k for the mold, then  ~$0.50 per case with 3k minimum.  Thats a lot of cases to break even....
<br />
<br />With the CIC cracked you could likely use a $0.50 pic chip to replace it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />With the Tengen chip looking custom and not standard motorola core as hoped, I think comparing the different nintendo region chips would be best.  The hardware should be the same, with very small differences in the rom.  Comparing those might give hints on where the data and where the code might be.  I think I supplied neviksti with ~5 different chips, including the two usa versions.  I also have an snes cic (d411?) that should again be the same hardware with a possibly different rom.  Can anyone confirm that the N64 uses the same cic again?
<br />
<br />For those that can understand the gate arrangement, figuring out the rom address/data decoders would be helpful for figuring out the possible instruction set.   Also might be interesting to look at the pins that arent used to see if they go anywhere useful.

I agree, let's forget about the Tengen for now, and I'll start on those other chips that you sent.  I'm not sure what to expect, but I really hope for small changes in the ROM.<br /><br />For the people that looked at the data sequences with a logic analyzer (or equivalent homebrew):<br />Did you look at different region CICs?  It would be great to have a yeah/neah on whether or not we can expect at least the startup sequence to be the same (ie the begining code to be the same) across all regions.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">bunnyboy wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I also have an snes cic (d411?) that should again be the same hardware with a possibly different rom.  Can anyone confirm that the N64 uses the same cic again?</div><br />Yeah, I looked at a D411 chip.  It is the same hardware.  I also dumped the ROM and it looked very different to me.  <br /><br />As for the N64, I keep getting requests to look at those.  I'm curious, but backlogged at the moment.  So maybe down the road we can check into it, but for now I'll try to get the ROM from those other chips (I appologize that this is going so slow).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">bunnyboy wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">For those that can understand the gate arrangement, figuring out the rom address/data decoders would be helpful for figuring out the possible instruction set.</div>
<br />I can't see how to identify the high address lines from the low address lines just by looking at them.  So trying to 100% identify the bit order from the pictures will not be easy (but if we're even considering tracing the logic in the first place, I agree that would be a good place to start).
<br />
<br />If I get some good pictures of all the layers, how many feel they would like to help with identifying the logic?  If we each choose a section (program counter, instruction decoder, etc) it could go much quicker.

<br />I'd be interested in helping.  I have a solid electrical and logic background (EE).  I'll have to pick up the VLSI needed as we go.
