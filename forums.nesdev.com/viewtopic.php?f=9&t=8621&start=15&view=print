<br />That is not what I discovered from my own personal observations in fixing dozens of these bad reproductions.
<br />
<br />From the reproductions I saw that failed, they all had 30 gauge wire.

<br />As far as soldering goes, I always tin all my wires before making a connection.  I guess old habits; it doesn't add that much more time to the process, and I find the connections to be much better w/o future failure.

<br />Well I am not a native english speaking person, perhaps I expressed myself badly. I really meant you kept the wires you were already using.
<br />
<br />I find amusing when for example I show pictures of things I assemble with enamel coated wires and people start to complain about how I am using non insulated wire on the circuit. It's the fact that the wire is coated with enamel makes it insulated, but it surely does look like an naked copper wire.
<br />
<br />That's aways fun.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

<br />
<br />There could be so many things that can cause this:
<br />
<br />- bad ROM removal (causing shorts between pins - installing new CHR-RAM made the problem clear away due to 2nd cleaning)
<br />- bad soldering (when soldering, make sure solder flows through hole and catches pin on both sides)
<br />- wire stripped to much, to the point where tip actually touches 2 adjacent pins
<br />
<br />What about the CHR enable? Are you using a cart with all pins, or are you faking it by adding metallic tape?
<br />
<br />I have never ran into an SRAM chip that didn't work!  And I've made A LOT of these games.
<br />
<br />All reproduction failures I fixed were due to bad wire.  When I replaced the wire, reproduction started to boot.

<br />
<br />The new IDE cable will not work.  When they introduced speeds of &gt;66mb/s they switched cable design.  You need to use the older style (i.e. floppy drive cable)

<br />
<br />These are made of rigid copper core, which is not a bad thing, but with conductors coated with plastic, it's possible that you might overlook an eventual crack on the conductor.
<br />
<br />With enamel coated wires, should the wire break the coating is thin enough to break just along with the wire and that you can see it broke. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

It resists cross talk better, and you can run it for longer lengths.<br /><br />The problem with the CHR-RAM chip is the CHR enable wire.  It's the longest wire in any reproduction (pin 56 on connector) and picks up a lot of noise, and feeds it into the CHR-RAM chip.<br /><br />Sorry for the rant.. tired of fixing bad eBay reproductions.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

<br />
<br />And the rats step out of the of the gutters .. welcome.
<br />
<br />When you have reproduced next to 5,000 games in over a decade, then maybe I'll believe a word you say.  Reading something in a book and doing it in real life are 2 different things.
<br />
<br />I didn't believe it either, until I discovered it in person over the years. Continuity tests on 30ga wire shows perfect connections; removing the eproms and dumping them verified 100%.  Replacing the wire caused the games to boot.  Common sense would say it can't be so, but my experience showed otherwise.

But then we're talking about gigabytes per second of transfer rates. At 1.75mhz crosstalk is a non issue, to be very honest.
<br />
<br />If crosstalk was a issue, the "horrible" things I assemble would either not work at all or glitch a lot.
<br />
<br />I'm not defending either sides, just citing that what was observed by leon could be something else, such as poor soldering (it's actually harder to solder properly single core conductors as the contact surface for the solder is smaller than that of a multi core conductor).
<br />
<br />And 80 wire ATA cables do use single core conductors.
