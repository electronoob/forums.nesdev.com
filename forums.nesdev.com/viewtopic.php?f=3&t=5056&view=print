When this happened to me I just looked into it on a game-by-game basis, since I did not buy a PowerPak to put my entire pirate ROM collection in it. If you are planning on putting a huge amount of games on your CF card, it'd be much faster to let a tool fix your headers for you.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">anyone know the bad about this product and good</div>
<br />GOOD:

<br />
<br />This is all I can thing of right now.

All I did was File...edit iNES header... then open your .nes rom, then don't do anything in the dialog box. Just hit Save As...once you have hit "ok" to save, a box will pop up saying do you want to fix the header (or something like that, forget the message). Just hit yes. For all my roms that had said: 'Bad File Header" in Powerpak, they now work fine!

I've done that enough with chips+sockets, it gets old.  Also I'm really surprised to hear that MMC3's scanline counting doesn't work.
<br />
<br />The good thing would be putting a lot of stuff on the cart and just leaving it in the NES.  And having an FPGA to play around with, if you're into that sort of thing.

<br />Well, you don't typically do that so often. I needed some 6 or so tests to fine tune my latest scrolling-glitch-hiding technique, which was somewhat annoying, but usually I have a few days, or even weeks between tests on hardware. I do most of the work with emulators.
<br />
<br />I guess that once you have the basic framework ready (video and audio), the rest is just logic, and since CPU emulation is much more accurate than PPU or APU emulation, emulators should be enough for the task.

<br />
<br />Yeah that's usually true.
<br />
<br />I've taken the opposite approach, usually when I was making the most progress I used my ROM emulator.  Then I can just hit F9, reset the NES after a second or 2, and not even have to leave the code editor.  Saves time.  I also found it motivating to see/hear it running on the system, and of course the screen looks very different from emulators.  NEStopia's tv mode seems closer to it.  It also allowed me to eventually use my own boards that aren't emulated.

<br />That's pretty cool! But there's the fact that you have zero debugging capabilities on a real NES. I mean, other than those you've programmed into the game yourself, but it's still much easier to look at FCEUXD's hex editor than writing a subroutine to display numbers somewhere on the screen. And there are kinds of debugging that I don't think are even possible with just the real console (CPU tracing, watching name tables, things like that).

<br />
<br />I have a PowerPak and I like it.  The latest version of <a href="http://www.allgoodthings.us/mambo/index.php?option=com_simpleboard&amp;Itemid=42&amp;func=view&amp;id=33&amp;catid=4" class="postlink">GoodNES (version 3.14)</a> has a "fixnes" option that automatically fixes all of your ROM headers with a single command.  I recommend using this technique as opposed to using Nesoptia because the Nestopia method requires manual work for each ROM.
