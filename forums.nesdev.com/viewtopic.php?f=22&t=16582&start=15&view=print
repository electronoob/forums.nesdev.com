I might need him again in the future <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Great point on the one tile units. Once I have a working AI I will create more unit types I will try it out. I like the idea of flying units with a shadow.  It also depends on how much memory I've left to keep track of them. <br /><br />btw if you press select in the title screen you can see the animation of the unit types (b toggles types, a makes them move). <br /><br />On the subject of AI, this is going to be my logic: <br /><br />  ; 1 select the most attractive player controlled target<br />  ;   consider all player units<br />  ;   lowest score wins:<br />  ;   (100-ranged attack hit probability) + target hp + distance<br />  ;<br />  ; 2 determine available options<br />  ; - ranged attack 1 on target<br />  ; - ranged attack 2 on target<br />  ; - close combat on target<br />  ; - charge target<br />  ; - move / pivot towards attack position on target (this is complex)<br />  ; - cool down<br />  ; - move towards defensive position (this is complex)<br />  ;<br />  ; 3 score all available options<br />  ; - based on relevant factors (AP, HP, expected DMG etc)<br />  ;<br />  ; 4 some randomness: pick best option 70%, second best 20%, third best 10%<br /><br />The challenge is to minimize the number of times that you need expensive subroutines such as calculating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm" class="postlink">shortest path</a> and calculating if there is line of sight.<br /><br />So for example, once the AI decides that the best available action is to move to an offensive position, the AI will need to find a grid node that puts the AI controlled unit close enough to the target that it's within its range, has line of sight to the target and is reachable from the AI units current position. <br /><br />Would appreciate any insights folks have to offer

An extra half-second of processing during an enemy's turn is an eternity in terms of processing time, but wouldn't impact the game much at all.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's a really good point. With a little luck/effort, you may be able to silently perform the calculation all while signing the turn transition to the player. I'd just recommend keeping the transition as short as needed be and let the calculation spill over if it needs to. That would appear as the enemy thinking/deciding. I imagine that should be less jarring than dragging out the transition sequence visually/functionally.<br /><br />(Old) chess games will often make you wait while the computer is thinking. Playing some of these oldies in emulation might help get a feel for how long is too long. Besides the fact that i could never beat a particular game when set at its hardest difficulty, i also avoided that setting because the cell phone in question took way too long.

How do you hide sprites that are touching the HUD? The only way I can think of is putting 8 empty sprites at the row of the HUD. Is there another way? Disabling sprites in PPUMASK at the correct y-pos, maybe?</div><br />I briefly suggested a couple of possibilities in my <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=206121#p206121" class="postlink">earlier post</a> but here's some more explicit explanations:<br /><ul><li> Using an IRQ to enable sprites via $2001 at the correct scanline is probably the easiest way. This game in particular seems to be using mapper 25, so IRQ might be an option?</li><li> Manually remove sprites coarsely above the split point, and then put 8 hidden sprites on the bottom row to more finely block sprites that overlap there.</li><li> Write a cycle-timed NMI routine and just create a timed wait until the split point to enable sprites.</li><li> Just move the HUD to the bottom and continue to use sprite 0 hit.</li><li> Just don't bother solving the problem.</li></ul><br />TBH, in this particular game the main problem I am seeing is that the sprites disappear before the should be hidden by the edge at both the top and bottom; on both sides this creates situations where it can look like nobody's standing there on cells at the top of the bottom of the screen-- bad information if you're trying to make a tactical decision! The same thing happens at the left and right edges too, actually.<br /><br />Hiding them above the hud is just something I'd probably pursue for visual consistency but it's not really a gameplay issue? There's another visual issue at the left and right edges too, i.e. if a mech moves from offscreen they will appear briefly at the wrong side while moving across the edge, but at this point I'm assuming it's all subject to change/revision anyway. The left and right edges tend to be tricky on the NES, as I'm sure everyone's aware. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><br />Actually, on the subject of things happening at the edges it might be important to note that a lot of TVs, especially older ones, will cut off some of the edge. Everything at it is currently seems to go right to the edges, like the pilot's face, and this could be a problem. Nintendo and other console publishers have always given guidelines about keeping anything important (especially text) away from the edges of the screen by a small margin, and they still do so even now in the HDTV era.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for putting in the time to help me rain warrior. I very much appreciate it.<br /><br />Yep, mapper 25. I started with mapper 23 but that didn't work on my powerpak.<br /><br />You are right that its all subject to change at this point. To keep up the momentum I tend to leave features in a &quot;good enough&quot; state and then move on to the next thing. Perfecting and refactoring things takes forever <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />I will try to use the IRQ solution. I still have to familiarize myself wit the workings, but it sounds promising. That will take care of the top/bottom cut off. <br /><br />Currently the game does  a very crude cut-off based on the screen coordinates of the grid position (iow not even sprite coordinates) and only for the mechs.  I will have to bring it down the the sprite level anyway, because most of the effects (including the new waypoints for movement) completely ignore the left/right. Shame on me!<br /><br />As for tactical decisions, you are right that its key to know where the other units are. And probably not only the ones that are right on the edge. I have thought about how to inform the player of the location of other units on the field (without having to scroll over the map). One of the things I intend to try is markers at the edges of the screen, but until now that has gone into the category 'perfecting things' <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />.<br /><br />It is possible to hold B to scroll the map while choosing a facing direction. At least that way you know from which direction you can expect the enemy to show up. <br /><br />Thanks for the link. I think I did come across it some time ago (I spent a serious number of hours on the wiki and this forum before before I got my code to work to do ... well ... anything ). The challenge is that there is so much information that needs to go into the HUD, while trying to keep the three sections clearly defined (player - action - target). I expect I could make the &quot;action&quot; section less wide have some margin on the edges.

I have not incorporated all the factors that I would like the AI to consider, but I've started on the framework and I think it will do nicely. Turns out that computation time is not really an issue at all. The AI will skip some frames while deciding on the next move, but I think it is hardly noticeable (as some folks had already suggested in an earlier post). It starts to feel slightly more like a game now <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

Up to 16 units, to be exact.<br />- Added missile attack animation (wpn 2)<br />- Worked on the map tiles<br />- Worked on the AI and game mechanics<br />- New object model <br /><br />the link is in the original post<br /><br />all feedback is very much appreciated!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the encouragement SoleGoose, I appreciate it!<br /><br />I've been working on a roster screen that allows the player to assemble a team of 3 mechs, being able to choose the mech type, the pilot and 2 equipment slots. It works, but I still need to implement selection restrictions, e.g a pilot should can only be assigned once and unique equipment.<br /><br />I've also included a JUMP action for the lightest mech available (GEIST) allowing to move over obstacles and gaps. Additionally, a unit that jumped will be better at evading attacks until its next turn, at the expense of generating a heat point and reducing its own accuracy<br /><br />I have also revised many of the rules around damage / to hit percentages. I took inspiration from the table top game ALPHA STRIKE, i.e., instead of having several weapons that you'd need to toggle and figure out (= not fun), the game now uses the a single damage profile per unit indicating how much damage it can inflict at different ranges. <br /><br />The damage profile of a unit can be improved by equipping it with items or weapons, e.g., adding a ‘machine gun’ weapon to your unit improves damage to targets that are positioned 2 or 3 hexes from the attacking unit.<br /><br />This allows for different units with specialized roles, like close combat mechs vs long range fire support, while keeping the complexity towards the player at bay. I also like that it makes movement far more relevant.<br /><br />Next I will be improving the AI’s actions and many other loose ends, before moving on to the meta game – which involves moving from one mission to the next, XP points, gaining of items and all of that.
