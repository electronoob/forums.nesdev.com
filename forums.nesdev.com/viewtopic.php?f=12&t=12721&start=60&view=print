Releasing 32-bit compatibility builds and 64-bit accuracy builds was just an arbitrary choice that byuu made. The build I use on my own Linux machine is 64-bit compatibility.

I think most people at this point would be best-suited by the 64-bit compatibility build, whereas a 32-bit accuracy build would be too underperforming to be worth it (and I doubt many potential users still need the performance profile <em>that</em> much...)<br /><br />I personally did not even own a 64-bit machine until fairly recently, which is one of the reasons I didn't publish 64-bit builds until now (the other being the aforementioned lack of official 64-bit Qt binaries for Windows). But both of those aren't issues for me anymore, and I can keep producing 32-bit builds with the same toolchain, so I'll likely continue to do so until it stops being feasible.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I gave up on 32-bit builds, myself.<br /><br />For whatever reason, the 32-bit MinGW project ships with headers from Windows 98. They don't even have headers for <em>DirectDraw</em>. I used to have to dig out the DirectX SDK from November 2008, pull out its headers to drop into MinGW, and then go find glext.h from opengl.org, just to get stuff compiling. I'm tired of doing all the extra work.<br /><br />I haven't heard a single complaint from anyone for not having the 32-bit builds anymore. And I usually average around 60,000 downloads a release (it was a 2:1 split on 64-bit vs 32-bit when I released both), so I don't think it's really a big issue anymore.<br /><br />And as much as I want to drop the performance profile, the bottom-tier computers (Zotac Zbox BI-320, Intel NUC5CPYH, etc) still require it to run at full speed. The 10% speedup for 64-bit mode is quite nice here. Even with that, I still dip to around ~55fps during the Yoshi's Island title screen, but the games themselves are all playable.<br /><br />Another nice ~10% speedup is to use profile-guided optimizations. But like the 32-bit builds, I just couldn't keep up with all the extra work they require (it was seriously taking me 4-6 hours to put together new release builds at one point), so I stopped doing it.

Now that I use mingw-w64, I can just make both 64- and 32-bit builds with the same stock toolchain in about 30 seconds total. (I do plan to eventually commit some makefile additions to streamline it a bit for other people, but it definitely beats having to scavenge for fixes to an out-of-date compiler distribution.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&gt; Have you tried MinGW-W64? Despite its name, it can make 32-bit builds.<br /><br />Yes, -m32 produces binaries with miscompiled instructions. This causes lots of weird glitches and outright crashes depending upon what you do. It's probably fine for simple projects, but doesn't work for something as complicated as higan. The NES core seems especially prone to problems.<br /><br />I guess the SNES core is stable enough for Revenant, so that's good at least.

The compatibility profile caches the BG scroll registers so the message and HUD both end up stationary. And a long time ago with v073 accuracy, the timing was wrong so the effect didn't work right. It's fixed in since probably v078 or so, but ... yeah. I get that I change the internals too much for you to be able to do much besides attempt back-porting fixes. Especially for your specific case where you can't just use the relatively stable Emulator::Interface, but have to tap into all the internal state for the debugger. We're in kind of a lose-lose situation here with all these forks, unfortunately :(<br /><br />The ASP devs definitely enjoyed toying with the PPUs.

I know ASP has been well-known for doing some rather uncommon stuff with the PPU, but I didn't realize the BG scrolling trickery behind that text (or whatever it is) until I tried it for myself. Doing a comparison of the accuracy PPUs in higan and bsnes-plus didn't reveal anything obviously relevant to me, but I'm certainly not all that familiar with the details of either one.<br /><br />I did backport the fix you recently made for ATX2, and I know AWJ made some other changes to the PPU a while back, but do you think there are any other potential accuracy issues still worth checking on?
