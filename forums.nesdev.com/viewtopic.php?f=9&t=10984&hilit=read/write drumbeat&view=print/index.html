Falling edges of M2/phi2 defines the end of one cycle and beginning of the next.<br /><br />The mmc1 basically keeps track of what the last cycle was,  if it was a write cycle, then it doesnt allow writes to the shift register.  It only allows writes if the last cycle was a read cycle.  That's why the garbage writes of RMW instructions is the one that gets latched, and the actual write that follows is ignored.

Not sure how to be more clear than that.  <br /><br />I really don't know what an odd vs even CPU cycle is...  Are you defining odd vs even based on the program counter (PC) being odd/even?  If so, my answer is still no.  I think it's safe to say mappers never know if it's an even/odd CPU cycle.<br /><br />Perhaps the even/odd confusion is coming from the '2' in M2 (aka phi2).  The '2' doesn't mean even.  '2' is just a label.  phi1 is some other clock that I can't recall off hand.
