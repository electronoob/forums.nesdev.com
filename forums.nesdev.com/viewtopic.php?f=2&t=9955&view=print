	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm getting some odd results when I reset 10-Yard Fight, Xevious, or Ikari Warriors via power button (not the reset button).  10-Yard Fight's title screen scrambles a little but displays normally after that, and Xevious and Ikari Warriors aren't booting, but resetting with the reset button allows the games to load properly.  However, after a 10-second period of the system being off, the games will load properly.  Kinda weird.  The system and all carts were extensively and properly cleaned prior to this discovery.  Also, this is the first time I've had a NES in literally years so I can't say I'm the expert on knowing this kind of hardware.<br /><br />I'm sure it isn't a big deal, but I need to be sure if this behavior is normal.  I haven't found a problem with the rest of my carts.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Dry or dead capacitors is possible I think. I have a Golf cartridge that seemed to not want to work on power up but would work after hitting reset. Remember the caps in your carts are *really* old now. I think the caps in the cartridges are for smoothing out your power to components so maybe if they aren't working the CPU crashes because of the PRG-ROM not being accessed correctly from power dipping. Someone else may have a better idea.

I still think it's a cap issue since it's only *some* carts. The lockout chip would seem like it would affect all carts. You could try finding a replacement for the capacitor in one of your 3 carts and see if that fixes it. Worst case is it gets a new cap but still has the issue.
