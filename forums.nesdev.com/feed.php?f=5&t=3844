The palette is more or less the same on PAL/NTSC sytems, it only slightly differs, nothing to worry much about. In fact the difference between one NTSC TV and another NTSC TV may be quite big as far I've heard - <strong>n</strong>ever <strong>t</strong>wice the <strong>s</strong>ame <strong>c</strong>olor.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Jan 18, 2008 3:04 pm</p><hr />

Oh, allright. Usually 'HVC' is for japan, 'NES' for america and 'PAL' for PAL territories, but when Nintendo re-used the ROM from a previous release they didn't change it's name.<br /><br />You are right the american version of SMB has all 'HVC' chips as the whole thing is untouched from japan, in fact only the cartridge case change but the ROM is exactly the same.<br />Seems they released early PAL carts with a different case and lockout chip (meaning cart themselves cannot be interchanged), but with the exact same ROMs than japanese and american version. Because PAL hardware is different, it runs a 50Hz, meaning the whole game runs at 5/6th of the normal speed, and that the music is about one tone lower. Since SMB doesn't use raster effects, it runs fine on PAL even if it is slower so they didn't need to change anything. However for some reason they decided to addapt SMB to PAL region, fasting up the ROM and corrected the music pitch so that the result on a PAL console is similar to the result on a NTSC console. This cart is not a prototype, it's just an unrevised cart wich is most likely rarer than revised carts. Feel free to submit it to <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/home.php" class="postlink">bootgod's database</a> if you want, the database currently only have revised SMB carts.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Jan 18, 2008 3:03 am</p><hr />

Hey guys,<br /><br />I have a few different carts of Super Mario Bros. (All PAL). Anyway, I grab a random one to play and stick it into my machine. Im playing it and something isn't right, then it hits me, it's playing slow. The gameplay, the music and the sound effects are all running slow. Noticably slow to someone who is familiar to SMB.<br /><br />So I stick in my other carts of SMB and they all run at the normal speed.<br /><br />So I get curious.<br /><br /><br />Exterior, the slow version has 2 Nintendo seals of approval (one in english and another in what looks like some kind of european language.). They are gold and black and read "This seal is your assurance that Nintendo has approved the qality of the product."<br />There are also two stars visible near the two seals.<br /><br /><img src="http://i259.photobucket.com/albums/hh297/master_jawa/slowfront.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />On the back is a caution sticker witten only in english.<br />There are also 5 screw holes.<br />These are also flat head screws holding it together instead of the security screws. <br /><br /><img src="http://i259.photobucket.com/albums/hh297/master_jawa/slowback.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />Internally, the pins run all the way across the board.<br />The board contains three big black things with pins comming out of them (sorry, i dont know what they are called.)<br />This slow cart has a resistor.<br /><br /><img src="http://i259.photobucket.com/albums/hh297/master_jawa/slowboard2.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i259.photobucket.com/albums/hh297/master_jawa/slowboard1.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br /><br />Now for the normal speed cart.<br /><br /><br />Externally, the normal speed version had one seal of approval. It is gold and white reading "Official Nintendo Seal of Quality".<br />There are no stars visable, just black.<br /><br /><img src="http://i259.photobucket.com/albums/hh297/master_jawa/normalfront.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />On the back is a caution sticker written in both English and whaappears to be a european language.<br />There are three screw holes.<br /><br /><img src="http://i259.photobucket.com/albums/hh297/master_jawa/normalback.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Internally the normal speed board has pins running across the board with a gap in the middle where there are no pins.<br />The three big black things are still on the board.<br />The resistor is much smaller and is in a different location on the board to the slow cart.<br />There is also a capacitor on this normal speed board. (I'm pretty sure it's  a capacitor, been years since I did electronics in school.)<br /><br /><img src="http://i259.photobucket.com/albums/hh297/master_jawa/normalboard2.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i259.photobucket.com/albums/hh297/master_jawa/normalboard1.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />I have been told that both are PAL B aswell if that makes a difference.<br /><br />Has anyone seen something like this before. Or can it be explained?[/img]<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3474">master_jawa</a> — Fri Jan 18, 2008 1:12 am</p><hr />
