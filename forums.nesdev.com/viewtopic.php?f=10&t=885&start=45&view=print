<br />Except as I understand it, the "fixed" bank normally present at $C000-$FFFF also gets bankswitched. Either you need to use identical "fixed" banks or you need to do some jump table stuff to move between the banks safely.

<br />So, the SUROM has some 32kb switching aspects... I mean the main PRGROM bank have to be swapped. Two options are to do everything with 32kb switching.
<br />The option I'd do is to copy NMI, IRQ and very important routine in both main banks. Then, the non-important routines that are affilated with the first 256kb of data would come in bank 15 and the routines affilated with the second 256kb of data would code in bank 31.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />SUROM looks a lot like a multicart mapper. In fact, the <em>Final Fantasy</em> multicart for Famicom used the same technique. So if you have two nearly separate game engines, stick them in separate banks. I don't know what Celius's demo is supposed to do, but in an RPG, you could stick all the battle related stuff in one bank and all the map related stuff in the other bank.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Great trick, tepples. Since your battle and menu routine would have nothing in common, not even the NMI routine, I think that really is a great idea. I'd stuck "rest" such as title screen and menus with battle, beacuse battle data is most probably getting a bit smaller than playfield data.
<br />
<br />However, most FF1 and FF2 engine is the same. All the engine that move characters and playfield arround is the exact same in both games.
<br />Only menu, music, intro and ending really differs (in an engine point of view, of course).

The 15th bank of PRG in the first 256k, and then the 15th bank in the second 256k? But I'm hearing about $C000-$FFFF being switched as well. Why would you do that? Why couldn't you just switch $8000-$BFFF, leaving $C000-$FFFF fixed to the 15th bank of whatever 256k your in? I don't think you have to be switching $C000-$FFFF. I see no reason why it would have to be switched.
<br />
<br />My DEMO doesn't really require SUROM. My GAME requires SUROM. Many banks full of maps, like, MANY banks full of maps. And it also requires many banks full of graphics, and many banks full of enemy data. Don't forget text, and event data as well.

<br />The reason is that the MMC1 does the OR logic needed for that on it's PRG outputs, but not on its CHR outputs. Since PRG A18 is wirted to CHR A16, CHR A16 won't be ORed with PRG A14, which is the only way to have a hardwired bank (in other word, when the programm counter is above $c000, so bit 14 set, all bankswitching lines are forced to be one with the OR logic internal to MMC1 to have the last bank acceded).
<br />
<br />I'd say to first code your game as a normal SNROM game. The day you'll run out of space (wich isn't probably today), you'll have to think about more complex SUROM bankswitching, and splitting your "hardwired" space in two banks. Since WLA has a special option to keep two track of the same code in two banks, it won't cause problem to duplicat some essencial code, such as the Reset code.

<br />Is it possible to keep track of the Program Counter? Because I want to switch banks, and then jump back to the same place. Is it possible? Hey, Memblers, you were saying about jsring to banks. I said it wasn't neccissary. I lied. How do you do such a thing?

<br />When you execute a JSR command the PC is stored on the stack. You could JSR to a routine that will pull that and use as you want. AFAIK, the only way to read the PC is getting it from the stack.

<br />
<br />What helped for me was having a byte in RAM that keeps track of your current selected bank.  There's a couple JSR's needed (so the routine can be called from anywhere).  Pretty much like this, with music code for example:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;jsr playmusic&nbsp; &nbsp;; .org anywhere<br /><br />playmusic:&nbsp; &nbsp; ; .org in fixed bank, RAM or manually mirrored PRG for 32kB pages<br />&nbsp;lda current_bank<br />&nbsp;pha<br />&nbsp;lda #NSF_play_banknumber<br />&nbsp;sta current_bank<br />&nbsp;sta $8000 ; mapper write<br />&nbsp;jsr NSF_play <br />&nbsp;pla<br />&nbsp;sta $8000 ; insert mapper write here<br />&nbsp;rts<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Whenever you bankswitch, then update the current_bank at the same time.  Pushing it on the stack like that makes it recursive, so you could JSR between several banks within that routine and still return to the original (if you really wanted to).  But it complicates the code a bit, it could be simplified if you don't need to do anything really fancy.
