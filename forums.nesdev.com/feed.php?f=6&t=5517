I'm working on something similar on my AVR chip: each quarter note is divided by 96 ( so it's 96 Pulses Per Quarter, or 96 PPQ ) so the tempo is just the number of PPQ per frame, and that number is in the format 8.8 (16 bit fixed point). Of course, you get uneven note lenghts, but that's fine because it will be unnoticeable.

I know with NT2 for example, it's native to PAL mode (and doesn't have these fancy fixed-point tempo controls), so when playing in NTSC it just skips every 6th frame!  At least one NT2 user, Chibi-Tech, hacked the replay engine to be NTSC-native (no frame skipping).  So his tunes actually play slower in the tracker.  So I just don't see a way around it, either limiting the tempos to certain speeds, or just living with timing oddities.  All my songs have this timing discrepancy throughout the whole thing, but did anyone ever notice?<br /><br />BTW, the $55 overflow trick is what I use for scanline timing to get the coveted .666 cycles (combined with a "branch to nowhere").<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Aug 21, 2009 12:32 am</p><hr />

Unless you want to use scanline IRQs to trigger new notes mid-frame to be able to actually have notes that are (almost) 3.33333... frames long I don't see how you would get around this. Some notes will have to be one frame longer than the others, depending on the tempo used. And besides, even on a PAL machine 1 frame is only 20ms, so it's not a big issue IMO, even for 32nd notes.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1181">mic_</a> — Fri Aug 21, 2009 12:12 am</p><hr />

In my engine, $55 will clock the song every 3 frames, but what ends up happening is this:<br />55 -&gt; AA -&gt; FF -&gt; 54 -&gt; A9 -&gt; FE -&gt; 53 -&gt; ...<br /><br />Until this happens:<br />... -&gt; 02 -&gt; 57 -&gt; AC -&gt; 01 -&gt; 56 -&gt; AB -&gt; 00 -&gt; 55 -&gt; AA -&gt; FF -&gt; 54<br /><br />You see it takes 3 additions to overflow the counter, until it rolls over to $00, in which it takes 4 to overflow the counter, then it goes back to 3.<br /><br />If anyone could suggest a better way to handle tempos, Sivak and I would greatly appreciate it. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Thu Aug 20, 2009 11:54 pm</p><hr />

I use fixed point for the note delays. So if I wanted a tempo of 140 bpm on a PAL machine, that would make each quarter note 21.42857 frames, or 5485 in 16.8 fixed point.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1181">mic_</a> — Thu Aug 20, 2009 10:31 pm</p><hr />

Well, I had been noticing that the music with the music engine I have has been doing things like having notes be delayed at random intervals.  I found that this was due to the tempo not being a power of 2...<br /><br />The best example I can give is a 150 tempo song, which ended up translating into this with the engine:<br />Tempo of $55 and 32 beats = one measure...<br /><br />These songs would skip fairly often and it was annoying, so I went ahead and made these changes:<br />Tempo of $80 and 48 beats = one measure.  This has no skipping, and that's great.  These settings also have the desired tempo of 150.<br /><br />My problem lies with having both tempo control and skipping avoidance...   I can use weird numbers for the tempo control and hope no one notices TOO MUCH, but I'm wondering if there's a better way...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3374">Sivak</a> — Thu Aug 20, 2009 8:35 pm</p><hr />
