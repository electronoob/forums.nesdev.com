		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was trying hard not to listen to the negative things I had read about retrousb.com's awful customer service, but they're turning out in my case to be true.  As some of you may remember, I fed them over 300 dollars in a single night.  I placed an order for an NES PowerPak and an SNES PowerPak.  The NES one is phenomenal and was worth every penny.  The SNES one wound up making a pretty paperweight.  I tried to give retrousb the benefit of the doubt and special ordered the best cf card I could find.  I even managed to get the site owner to respond to one or two of my e-mails.  But the thing still wasn't working so I sent it back.  Their FAQ claims that anything returned within a certain amount of time is good for a refund.
<br />
<br />USPS delivery confirmation proves my package arrived back to its source over a week ago.  After several days I contacted support, asking what the usual window for a return might be.  I did get a reply after my second attempt at this question.  I was told it varies because returns has a backlog of returns to process.  That should have tipped me off right there.  They have so many returns to check that they can't be bothered to open my return just to see that I sent them everything they had sent me?
<br />
<br />I replied to that message and reminded the site owner I was not interested in repair or replacement, only a refund as the FAQ promises.  A few days later he replied and said that he could see if they could check it out sooner if I was in a rush.  Apparently my slew of e-mails on the subject didn't convince him that I was serious.  I asked him to please ask them to simply check my package as it is being returned for a refund only and support has to do nothing else but verify I sent the right item back.  Apparently, this is a complicated procedure as I am still waiting for confirmation not only that they have the return but that the refund is even close to being processed.
<br />
<br />Bottom line, ordering from them seems to be a gamble.  The NEW PowerPak works great and seems to have gotten a lot of positive reviews.  The SNES counterpart is finicky as all get out and your chances of a non-functional unit are high.  Customer service from the main site is slow to respond and will not process your return in any sort of timely manner.  Be warned, if they're so backed up that even after 7 days they haven't had a chance to peek at my return, there's something wrong.
<br />
<br />To those of you who have a working SNES PP, I am happy for you.  To everyone else, save your money.  Throw in the extra 35 bucks and get an SD2SNES.

And it isn't as simple as just opening a box and seeing that something is there. He has to actually examine things. Now ofcourse it is unfortunate because no one likes to wait around, particularly if they had big money involved.
<br />
<br />Your SNES PowerPAK probably was fine. I didn't see if you posted any threads asking for help so I'm not sure how much you tried to get it to work. Mine has always worked fine. I've heard sometimes people try different CF cards, sometimes different SNES consoles. I'm not sure what the issue may have been. I hope you can get it worked out. The SD2SNES seems nice but it is quite expensive, and it isn't as available as other devices. KRIKzz makes them now but there seems to be a backlog of demand not yet settled. The Super EverDrive is another choice, unless you absolutely have to be able to play something like 12 more games for 100$ more.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you for your reply.  I did post several times asking for help here as well as at nintendoage.  I tried several different CF cards, several ROM dumps, as well as programs designed to fix bad headers.  I really wanted this device to work and fiddled with it for a week.
<br />
<br />The way the gentleman spoke to me via e-mail did not make it sound like he was also the tech support team.  He mentioned having to ask "them" if they'd be willing to bump up my order for checking.  I respect that he's a busy man, but when you're selling niche pricey items a little customer service goes a long way.
<br />
<br />"Sometimes our tech team gets very backed up there, and tend to take a bit
<br />of time getting to returns.  If it is really important that you get your
<br />refund ASAP, I'll really push them to get to your stuff" seems to imply it's not just one man.

<br />Have tried several cards and failed, I managed to get the same DANE ELEC card from eBay for ~10GBP and the SNES powerpak worked fine and as expected. Never had a problem with it TBH....
<br />They did take about a week to reply (says so in their website) but they did in a polite manner and offered advice on what to look out when buying another CF (no high speed or ???x speed cards)
<br />
<br />In fact I am so happy with it that I am not letting it go even though I just got a sd2snes ... sorry to hear about your problems I_Am_Error  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

It really is a beautiful piece of equipment and I tried everything I could to get it working.  The craftsmanship is very nice and it's flat-out just a great looking cart.  The e-mails I have gotten have been very professional, I just wish they had a larger staff  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />   I think the main reason I got so frustrated was because I was very excited about this purchase and it just didn't work out at all.  I can imagine, though, if someone has a working one that it's a great device.  My NES PowerPak is wonderful and I'm thrilled with its performance.  Some folks criticize that you have to hit RESET when saving, but I look at is an a nice nod to the original NES where you had to do the same thing  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />I seem to remember (maybe I'm wrong), that OP had the CF shipped to him by RetroUSB together with the PowerPak. So trying a different CF card is basically pointless (unless the CF card itself was faulty, which is 1) unlikely 2) easily identifiable by putting the card in a CF card reader).

<br />
<br />I would bet your problem was related to the CF card and not the PowerPAK itself. Again, sorry that it did not work out.

I remember the super powerpak that had a simple DIP DSP-1 look like it was soldered in by somebody who didn't know how to solder. The CF problems not so bad, hopefully he figures that out, but then just so many bad carts shipped. I've heard this same story probably from at minimum 5 different people about how it just arrived dead with all different symptoms.
<br />
<br />And doesn't bunny have a helper or something working with him sometimes? The one that goes around NA (Errr, did) posting about retrousb's help.

It was ugly and I felt that I was entitled to have a new looking product after shelling out over 150$ + almost 30$ custom fee. I originally got a reply but then It took retrousb months before getting another reply from them. I only got it when I posted a comment about it on a thread about powerpak here. He did fix the issue by sending me a new label after about 4 months but he also made it clear that it will never happen again and that he really didn't feel my issue was a valid one. At least I got a solution in the end.

<br />
<br />I wonder if my bank would be able to help me out in any way.  I have USPS proof that my return was delivered over 9 days ago and my checking account reflects that the seller has made no effort to process the refund.  Perhaps they can do something?  I know PayPal helps in similar situations, but this was a credit card purchase.
<br />
<br />On a positive note, I got my first order from Retrogate today and it seems to work just fine!  It's an Everdrive64 cart but 'm having issues loading my save data.  Can any ED64 owners guide me through this?  I have the saves in the default ED64 folder and I see that the save files DO exist, but when I load up a game the files aren't accessed.  I'm not sure how to fiddle with the load settings so that the game knows where to look for the file.  Thanks!
