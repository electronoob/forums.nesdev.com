Are there a lot of those units around??<br /><br />I don't know if the SFCB uses a cic or not, I can check.   I WISH I had a translated English version -- the menu system.   The game roms are same as regular Snes roms.  I've already changed my roms to English versions.  It is possible to add many more games per cart.  The menu system is expandable.  But I don't know anything about how to do do that .  <br /><br />Mark

Another learning moment.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />I bought a cheap serial USB programmer off eBay and it was so easy, it's almost embarrassing. Thanks to all who made this possible.  Question: does the super cic have a pal feature and how is it enabled if so?<br /><br />Edit: The reason I had the confusion/problems early on was my programmer can only burn binary files.  <br />Which brings me to my next question.   Does the hex file send a read protect fuse command?<br />It appears it doesn't as I can rewrite a pic but I can't seem to get a binary read from a programmed pic. <br /><br />Thanks again!<br />Mark<br /><br />Don't suppose you have a mad1 replacement in the works???

I'm mostly curious whether or not the SNES key connects all of the ISP pins (1, 5, 6, 7, for the SOIC-8 Attiny13) to cart-edge pins or not.  If they are, I'll probably rework my project <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=112374#p112374" class="postlink">here</a> for your Attiny-based CIC and replace the PICkit header with an AVR-ISP one instead, which would be really nice...
