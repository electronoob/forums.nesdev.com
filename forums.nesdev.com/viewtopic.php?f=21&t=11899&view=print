For an ENTIRE game.<br /><br />I now want to program this into a working ROM. So I have been brushing up on ASM, and doing general research.<br /><br />How exactly do BG tiles work on the NES? I have read that sprites can be flipped, both horizontally and vertically, while BG tiles cannot be flipped.<br /><br />If this is the case, do BG tiles NEED to be 16x16, or can 16x16 metatiles be defined with pre-flipped versions of the 8x8 tiles? I am unsure about this, and my reading has not gotten me any futher in the last 5 hours.<br /><br />I am willing to expand the tileset as needed.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8ghrfSk.png" alt="Image" />

I have read that sprites can be flipped, both horizontally and vertically, while BG tiles cannot be flipped.</div><br />That's correct.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If this is the case, do BG tiles NEED to be 16x16, or can 16x16 metatiles be defined with pre-flipped versions of the 8x8 tiles?</div><br />The default palette boundaries for the background are 16x16 (so only one background palette can be used per 16x16 pixel area), but this does not affect which BG tiles can be placed where at all. BG tiles are 8x8. A 16x16 area can be any 4 BG tiles, even if all 4 are the same. It's worth planning out your tiles based around the palette boundaries, but that's all. <br /><br />Since a horizontally flipped BG tile takes up an extra tile regardless of if it is identical to another except flipped, you may as well make a &quot;flipped&quot; tile asymmetrical. Edit: I guess the exception to this is if you're using CHR RAM and want to save PRG space. Still, the flipped tile will take an extra tile in CHR memory.<br /><br />So what you're doing with a lot of stuff won't work using just one set of 256 tiles for both sprites and the background. For instance, in the mockup you have a tree drawn with a separate tile for top left and top right, but only the top left of the tree exists in the set. You would also need a top right tile to draw it because BG tiles can't be flipped. <br /><br />Alternate (more detailed/technical) answer: BG tiles can't be flipped by the HARDWARE the way sprites can. BG tiles can be flipped in software, and as long as your entire &quot;set&quot; (where each flipped tile still takes away from the total number of tiles) is less than 256 tiles. Even if you flip them in software, you still need copies of flipped tiles in the set in memory basically.<br /><br />There are 256 BG tiles in memory. You can just store flipped copies in ROM, each flip counts an extra tile of the 256. You can flip in software, each flip still counts as an extra tile of the 256. Same result, different process basically.<br /><br />Edit: What you're planning on doing with the text window has potential to mess with the level palettes. As stated above, the default background palette boundaries are 16x16. Your textbox is 3 tiles tall. (Top of textbox, row with text, bottom of textbox.) This means the row of tiles either directly above or directly below the textbox will become the textbox palette. (Or the textbox will be drawn as the level palette.)<br /><br />Here's an image I made demonstrating this (Note. The image is scaled 200%): <br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1b0aCGI.gif" alt="Image" /><br />If the textbox isn't alligned exactly with the 16x16 pixel palette boundaries, either part of the textbox will be drawn with the level palette, or part of the level will be drawn with the textbox palette.<br /><br />In the gif, the top of the textbox is always 8 pixels below a boundary, so every time it crosses into a new 16x16 boundary by growing left or right, the top part of that 16x16 boundary ends up with the textbox's palette. <br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I am willing to expand the tileset as needed.</div><br />You may as well expand both things. 256 separate 8x8 tiles for sprites, 256 separate 8x8 tiles for the background. This is what Super Mario Bros./Donkey Kong use and they both use no mapper. (That is, their cartridge does not allow them to access more data than NES supports by default.)<br /><br />Edit: Optimization of Cat<br />If you move two of the right facing sprites up, they're now identical to the first right facing tiles and can be removed. Then all front facing tiles that are flipped are removed.<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aGfvi8c.gif" alt="Image" /><br />The moving of the sprite tiles up to make them match wouldn't affect gameplay at all. You'd just draw those animation frames offset down.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, that all works. Again, it's worth making the flipped tiles asymmetrical for that sweet extra mile.<br /><br />Edit: Your sand is clever.  <img src="./images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" /> <br /><br />Small things: <br />1. Your 0(zero) and O(Letter O) are identical. So... you only need one.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br />2. You only need one sprite tile for what I assume will indicate current location on the minimap. Sprites can be placed arbitrarily, and the two you've got are identical beyond the spacing.<br /><br />One last thing to note. You probably know, better to say than not if you don't, though.<br /><br />You get 4 background palettes/4 sprite palettes on screen at one time, but there are no limits beyond that. So if you wanna make every dungeon a different set of colors, you totally can. Or you can make the spiders Red on some screens or whatever.<br /><br />All in all, would be a pretty graphically impressive NROM (no cartridge to extend NES capabilities) game especially with the many enemies you now have graphical room for.

While that means more sprite pixels on screen, it also means your ability to reuse sprite tiles is reduced, so think carefully before deciding on which sprite size you'll use.<br /><br />Also keep in mind that you can change which pattern tables are used for which purpose (background or sprites) at any time, even during rendering. This means you could, for example, use a sprite 0 hit after the status bar and change which pattern table is used for the background, in case you want to put tiles for another kind of environment in the pattern table that's currently only being used for sprites. It's true that having text in the middle of the screen makes this harder, because you need the alphabet available at all times. Anyway, I'm just saying this so you keep all the possibilities in mind.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The 16x16 palette rules, is why the water is green below those platforms.</div><br />That actually worked out quite well, because it looks like transparency, and you can still see the platforms a little bit before the water gets too deep.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Auuaaagh!

Of course graphics data has little bearing on a game's length, I'm talking about PRG space being sufficient enough.<br /><br />I'd love to see this on the next Action 53 multicart, perhaps as the highlight game.

In fact, a lot of Nintendo's earlier titles didn't look very good, I don't think their art got better until, I think, Doki Doki Panic.  I wonder what was responsible for everything looking blocky, possibly the fact they didn't have proper art software?  I do remember reading that in the earlier days, people had to use LED panels to make up sprites, and some used graphing paper.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The only criticism I have is that the dungeon graphics are really busy looking, so I have some suggestions:<br /><strong>Edit: Disregard this, check my later posts</strong><br /><br /><img src="http://drag.wootest.net/pixel/catquest_suggestions.png" alt="Image" /><br />This scene in particular was the busiest looking; there's just a lot of contrast and details everywhere.<br /><br />The first thing I did was remove the highlight on the wall bricks, which toned the contrast down a bit.<br />Next, I changed the water to be more of a solid color. The water's really nice looking, so maybe changing the palette to replace the black with a blue would help, instead of wiping out the details like I did.<br />The floor bricks really stuck out to me in other screenshots too. I removed the green highlight, which made those orb objects stick out a lot more, but the blue of the bricks touched the blue of the revised water too significantly, so I shortened the brick height by one. However, without the highlight, the bricks looked too flat, so I played with the shadows a bit to bring the 3d look back. Even though a pixel of blue touches the water, there's still enough of a line left to separate the two tiles.<br /><br />These are just suggestions, so take them or leave them how you see fit. The rest of your graphics look good.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree that this scene in particular looks kinda busy, but if he just removes details like you suggested the game will end up looking as dull as many existing NROM games. Maybe attenuating the highlights by messing with the palette will help, but flat out removing all the details like that doesn't do any good.
