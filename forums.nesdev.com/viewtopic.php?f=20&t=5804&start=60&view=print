<br />
<br />Hoot!  I see you
<br />have read the   
<br />relief...  While
<br />it does say the 
<br />island is but a 
<br />dream of the    
<br />Wind Fish, no   
<br />one is really   
<br />sure...  Just as
<br />you cannot know 
<br />if a chest holds
<br />treasure until  
<br />you open it, so 
<br />you cannot tell 
<br />if this is a    
<br />dream until you 
<br />awaken...  The  
<br />only one who    
<br />knows for sure  
<br />is the Wind     
<br />Fish...  Trust  
<br />your feelings...
<br />Someday you will
<br />know for sure...
<br />
<br />
<br />If I save and quit after this, this time I get a scrambled save select screen. If I turn off and on again, the game wasn't saved.

If I turn off and on, the save isn't lost and I appear again outside the Southern Shrine where I saved last time. I go inside, I read that stone, I go outside, the owl appears and again the game isn't saved.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello,
<br />
<br />I've been some months without looking this forum and I completely forgot to send the savefile. I finished Zelda Awakening by using the same savefile on the DX version and everything worked fine. Then I started playing Oracle of Seasons and then I continued with Oracle of Ages. Now I write again here because the game gets suddently locked (frozen screen) during the ending scenes, just before the credits. Luckily I could import the battery file in VisualBoy emulator and continue watching the ending scene and get the Heroe Secret.
<br />
<br />If you're interested, as a challenge, I'm sending you that Zelda Awakening savefile and this Oracle of Ages savefile, so that you can try to investigate and learn how to fix these issues.
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=JBHYZ9C0">http://www.megaupload.com/?d=JBHYZ9C0</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Note: both savefiles are for the EUR version and the bugs appear only with the GB SMART CART
<br />
<br />Thanks for your contribution!
<br />Regards,
<br />Josep M.

<br />
<br />I'm afraid I'm crazy busy these days (working full-time has that effect), so there's no way I could tackle the other Zelda games. I've never much cared for the Oracle games anyway, heh <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I also don't have a GBC, only a Pocket, so there's no way I could test on hardware at all.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Dear adam_smasher,
<br />
<br />Thanks for your efforts despite your busy work. About testing it on real hardware, I can do it for you to confirm patches work. If you use my savefile for Oracle of Ages, you load it, you walk ahead and the final scene starts. Soon after it freezes. I could play the entire game without any problem (but I couldn't see the ending). I guess it's some kind of protection maybe. I had to see the ending with an emulator. By the way, Oracle series are great!
<br />
<br />Josep M.
