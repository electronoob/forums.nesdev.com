I don't want to spend lots of money on something like this, if I did I would just take one out of a regula famicom or a famiclone, or go on a wild goose hunt tearing apart various old NROM games looking for an official converter. This would be for a special project I am working on.
<br />
<br />Of course, I could do a little poking around at parts sites online, but I don't know that the pitch of the connector is or how many pins it has or how thick the PCB is supposed to be.
<br />
<br />BTW, in case you haven't guessed, I am a bit of a noob when it comes to FC. Done a fair amount with the NES though... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />You want a 60 pin connector, .1" pitch pins, and for a board thickness of .043" or so.  A connector for .062" boards will work, but it will be loose and wobble about.
<br />
<br />I suggest buying the cheapest cart-accepting famiclone possible on ebay to get a reasonable connector.  I don't know how easily buyable connectors for this board thickness is.  .062" connectors are available all day long from everyone, but not the ones for thinner boards.
<br />
<br />One possible thing would be to bend the pins on a .062" connector outwards to grab the board tighter.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, one problem is that Famiclones are banned on ebay, only the Famiclones that are NES compatible with 72 pin slots are being sold (ie, yobo) I did manage to find a guy on the Benheck.com forums who had a leftover 60 pin slot from a famiclone that he tore apart to make a handheld unit, so I will be getting that from him for a very low price, about $15 cheaper than the cheapest famiclone I know of.
<br />
<br />Thanks for the help though <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Citation please. I thought Famiclones without a bundled pirate multicart became OK once Nintendo's NES patents ran out.

Maybe if someone has more time they can dig deeper.
