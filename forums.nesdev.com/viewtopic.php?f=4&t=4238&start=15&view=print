<br />Tetramino uses CHR ROM. But a lot of multicarts such as 100-in-1 Contra Function 16 and <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=3087" class="postlink">Double Crossing: The Forbidden Four</a> can run games that expect CHR ROM: they copy (or decompress) pattern tables into CHR RAM, put a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trampoline_%28computers%29" class="postlink">trampoline</a> in PRG RAM, and then jump to the game's reset vector. The CHR data and PRG data don't have to sit in the same bank.

It even has some CNROM and MMC1 games on it, all of which will freeze for a few seconds (without turning the APU off -_-) to reload CHR RAM at points where the originals would have swapped CHR ROM banks. It's a pretty impressive feat of engineering by pirate standards. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />It's not in the GoodNES set, although "150-in-1 (Mapper 43)" and "260-in-1" are exactly the same, with differing amounts of unique games and clones. It's worth checking out for the menu alone. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm using CHR-RAM right now, but I should've mentioned before that if anyone is using CHR-ROM, it's no problem to stick to it.  I'll be compressing any/all tiles as possible, probably with simple RLE.  Bankswitching is fine, but mid-frame (instant) CHR paging won't be doable on GC#2 (GC#1 actually did have 16kB of CHR-RAM, used on the titlescreen, but needlessly).
<br />
<br />I can make an IRQ counter, but I'll have to use up the parts I have first.  So it'll be later.  I'm sure I can do it with one chip (maybe not exactly like MMC3).  With all these interesting projects associated with it, I can make it happen eventually.
<br />
<br />I remember Wraith, that was cool.

<br />
<br />It will be a lot better available, because I'll be using parts that I'll be able to source when I need more.  That was the problem with the first Garage Cart, one of the main parts is a little obscure.
<br />
<br />To sell it, I'll be building them myself at home (not in a garage anymore, but in my basement, since I live in a new place) and selling them directly to anyone.  But I still have people on a waiting list from years ago (not taking new entries currently), mostly people who bought the first one, and they'll all be getting first crack at the low serial-numbered ones.
<br />
<br />I also have had an offer from a game store chain to carry it, I guess once ordering begins I'll see if I'm in any position to afford a quantity discount.  More than likely I'll be the only source, shipping worldwide.
<br />
<br />Also you can be sure that any profits I get from it are going back into my NESdev savings account.

<br />I included a copyright and name at the bottom of the title screen. I also dithered the white blocks that made up the title, just as a last-minute touch up. Please put THAT version on the cart, if you put it on =).

<br />EDIT: Any idea on what the cost will be for one of these?

<br />
<br />It's not very fun how the ship starts of in the middle of the screen and the blink/invincible time isn't very long.  The ship is also pretty sluggish.  Aside from those and there not being any music, it's pretty nice.  Also, the title logo could use a revamp.
<br />
<br />Not at all disrespecting your game, but just wondering what you all think?

<br />
<br />It is a cool game, it has a nice finished feel to it, complete with levels, little animations and stuff.  The sound effects work, but without music there's a kind of an eerie silence.  I would offer to do a soundtrack for it (heh, I already have songs I wrote for a non-existent space shooter), it would change the atmosphere of the game in a huge way and probably make it really weird.
