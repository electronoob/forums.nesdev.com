<br />That sounds like an idle threat. I'll have to discuss this with Memblers; if he agrees, we might just decide to ban you anyways.
<br />Because, you know, threatening the admins is a really <em>really <strong>really stupid</strong></em> thing to do.

<br />Yeah, I seriously doubt that... If that was a spam-attack threat, forget it. I can tell you how it will turn out: Not the way you were hoping.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, well personally I wouldn't have banned donknotts.  I was gonna tell him to combine his random-ish posts into one or a few threads (and maybe not reply to really old threads unless there's something substantial to add), before I noticed he was banned and reregistered and banned again already.  I might unban him, if he answers some questions I have (yeah, he emailed me).
<br />
<br />I wouldn't even think he's British btw, his IP addess resolves to an ISP in New York.  Unless there's some weird networking reason that would cause that to be the case.
<br />
<br />But as for this general forum, it really is intended for anyone to post anything (including game-related topics) and I like it that way.  I re-edit the forum index description to it's original state.  It doesn't mean I want the place to fill up with joke topics though.  As long as someone is interested in NES development (playing the games/demos/music, or following the developments at least) they should be ok to post anything.  On the old forums years ago I even posted a protest against the US Feds invading Iraq.  Though about everyone then seemed to agree that politics are a bad topic. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

On this site, that happens to be stuff related to video games (which pretty much everything in the forum was, until your friend donknotts came along).<br />That limit has now been clarified in the forum index.</div>
<br />I totally agree. General stuff is for anything, at long as the topic has chances to interest at least a small part of the user of the boards. This can be gaming, question about life, polls, or why not about mondial politics (while this can lead people to hate themselves just for political reasons, and not for social reasons that would be a shame). Speaking about something that interest noone is spam. Donknotss or whatever was his name is a human spammer, wich is even more anoying than automated spammers, because the barrier between spam and nonspam is harder to see.
<br />
<br />I think this guy is good only banned. He posted stuff from horrible spam (the worse surely is the topic with a recipe where he's the only stupid one to have answere himself) to mid-decent posts that are aking mid-decent questions and that are mid-related to NESdev, but I really don't think he asked anything interesting and he don't contribute to NESdev anyway, and he probably will never do.
<br />Finally, the fact that his bad attitude didn't change over warning, and that he created a second account definitely proof that he shouldn't be forgoven, at least not from a long, long, time (two or three years). His horrible posts were and still are confusing everyone. What I like on the NESdev boards, additionnaly to the fact that people are talking about NESdev, is that everyone is kind and there isn't annoying and unfriendly rules check everywhere, unlike places such as ZSnes forums.
<br />For the first time, people are disputing on NESdev forums since their creation, just because of HIM !! That's really more than enough to keep him banned. Unban him or even continue to speak about him will bring considerable evil to the forums.
