<br />That's exactly what I thought.  The problem is nobody takes me seriously as a homebrewer.  I say I could do one thing, somebody posts a link from some interview and say something like "no you idiot, do your research, the Snes can't do that because this guy says it can't."  I try to explain to them how advertising works, and how just because somebody programmed a game doesn't mean they always tell the truth, but they never beleive me.  I have to go out of my way just to make a freaking demo just to back up my argument, while other people could back up their argument just by posting a link.

<br />Some people aren't even swayed by a demo. Wikipedia editors, for one, will trust inaccurate information spread by the mainstream media over a first-hand account that debunks it simply because mainstream media are more widely believed reliable.

If somebody upset you because they trust a magazine over you, that's not our concern.  Frankly I'd say you should laugh it off.<br /><br />Stop arguing with people who have no idea what they're talking about, because even if you produce something to contradict them they likely won't believe it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Wikipedia editors, for one, will trust inaccurate information spread by the mainstream media over a first-hand account that debunks it simply because mainstream media are more widely believed reliable.

<br />Even so, I do think it's a necessary policy, given the nature of free editing on a wiki.  How else could they dispute incorrect information?  I could claim to be the White House cook and I know for a fact that Obama's marriage is falling apart.  As original research, who could dispute this?  I suppose it could be refuted by another user who claims they're the president's limo driver.

<br />
<br />The OP is otherwise known as "dragonboy".  Some who browses smwcentral.net or sega16 will know this guy for all the wrong reasons hah.  I remember browsing sega16 and seeing alot of rageposting from him over this very topic so it's just another attempt at seeking validation from elsewhere after being banned from said forum.  So yes actually, your quote actually summarises the topic quite well.

<br />Why do you care what other people believe is possible with the SNES? Do these people make up what you consider a potential audience for your game? If so, all that matters is whether they'll play it; if not, then they are by definition not an audience.

<br />I can't find an audience for action games on Super Nintendo.  The people who like Super Nintendo hate action games and the people who like action games hate the Super Nintendo.

Almost all SNES fans are familiar with these and the former is easily a personal favourite.  On hard mode, it's quite challenging and requires decent precision to get through unharmed.  Those are just two popular ones (in the platform shooter category), SNES fans are in no way strangers to action games.
