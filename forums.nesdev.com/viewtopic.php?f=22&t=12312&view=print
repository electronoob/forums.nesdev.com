I know this is NES Dev and not a blog or something like that, but has anyone ever made or considered making a topic where you can give a background about yourself? I'm not particularly interesting, put some of the other people here, to me, seem to be. This would go under general discussion, obviously.

On Wikipedia a lot of folks there use their User page for that purpose.  If you aren't sure what I'm referring to as examples (and these are on Wikipedia) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Damian_Yerrick" class="postlink">here's Tepples'</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dukandricka" class="postlink">here's mine</a>.  Currently I use <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/User:Koitsu" class="postlink">my Nesdev wiki User page</a> for a document I'm writing about all the things Microsoft broke/changed in Windows 7 (and will never repair, 100% certain of that) compared to XP and why that keeps me on XP.  (I should note I'm going to HAVE to move to Windows 7 due to hardware reasons (vendors aren't making XP drivers for newer hardware any more), but I'm putting that off as long as I possibly can)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This has nothing to do with the original thread, but I agree the decrease of customisation for Windows' GUI is awful. And every time someone sees me on Win7 they scream and believes I'm still using windows 98, because I use the &quot;Windows Classic&quot; theme, and apparently <em>most people didn't even go to the customisation screen since XP (and 7) to see that there is a fallback mode available.</em><br /><br />It's sad but it seems 90% of the people just use the default is available to them and don't even look for options and customisation. And needless to say I do not like most of the changes that has been made recently to desktops, no matter if it is Windows, Gnome or KDE. Completely bloated, why didn't just keep them simple like they were before ? Even LDXE, the supposedly &quot;lightweight&quot; desktop for Linux is bloated, as windows comes with so many buttons in the top bar I don't know what is their purpose, and defaults to 4 desktops, which I don't need, 1 is enough, thanks. I still think the &quot;Windows 95&quot; style is the best desktop you could ever get, and I also regret to the absence of pre-made colouring theme in &quot;Windows Classic&quot; mode, but I still use it as I never liked XP, and W2k is way too old to support new hardware.<br /><br />This has hardly anything to do with Nesdev except maybe the &quot;nostalgia&quot; thing, which may in fact have a bit influence on out opinion about desktops.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm in Ontario, Canaada, near Toronto. (Until recently was living in Toronto.)<br /><br /><br />As for desktop customization, I mostly tend to try to stick with defaults unless it's something that actually bothers me. That way if I ever use someone else's computer I will be familiar with the way it will most likely be set up. I'd like to be ready to drop-in on any computer I see, rather than sit down and be frustrated by the lack of customizations/extensions that I am so used to using constantly... For the most part I really just want the OS GUI to get out of my way and just let me run programs; I don't really care too much how it does this as long as it works okay. (Windows 8 is the first OS in a long while that I thought actually had something wrong with it in this respect.)<br /><br />My pet peeve in this respect is antialiased fonts. It is hell trying to disable cleartype on Windows; and for some reason it's the hardest to get rid of with Microsoft-made software that somehow overrides the user setting for it. It usually takes me a week to figure out how to disable (almost) all of it when I get a new computer. (It's still on my start bar... the last holdout...)<br /><br />I love KDE's 4 desktop setup. I wish Windows had it too (but I'm not willing to replace explorer to get it, see above). Having extra pages to organize open programs is great.

I still to this day prefer &quot;pixel-precise&quot; fonts.  I really cannot stand the anti-aliased or ClearType/subpixel-rendered look; I find it blurry and very hard to read (and my vision isn't that great either!), not to mention I find the text drawing in the OS much slower when this garbage is turned on.<br /><br />The only exception to this (for me) is when reading documentation that predominantly uses vectors (i.e. PDFs), where I find if done right it looks generally okay.  Oh, and it tends to look somewhat decent on smartphones, and that's solely because the physical screen sizes are so small combined with insanely high resolutions; on computers, for example, Apple's Retina displays look mindblowing and I can see it being more useful there.
