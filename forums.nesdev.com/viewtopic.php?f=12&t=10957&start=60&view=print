You can use 128 8x8 sprites without the need of dealing with the extra 32 bytes, and you don't need to use 16-bit mode or use more than a single bank.<br /><br />Also, is HLL a standard language that Nintendo uses, or does it refer to any high level language in general assuming that is what HLL stands for.

If the use of the dinky samples from Super Mario World are comparable to Mario's direct likeness, then something is wrong here. I've come across dozens of POS systems in small stores and gas stations that use the ring, drowning, and goalpost sound effects ripped straight out of Sonic the Hedgehog. Surprise surprise, nobody's upset! Those are <em>actual recognizable sounds</em>. Using an instrument sample from a SNES game will get nobody in trouble, especially since the game likely is not being sold. If someone uses a Mario sprite to teach themselves how to manipulate sprites for a demo, that's absolutely fine. A single sample of an instrument used in a part of one particular game is not going to tangle anyone's undergarments. <br /><br />If needed, take the sample, mar it up a bit until it's a little different, and use it. <br /><br />I don't see why the issue of &quot;THERE COULD BE A LAWSUIT&quot; is so often an issue that gets <em>excitedly</em> brought up.

He was seriously confused by all these steps.<br /><br />EDIT:  I have an idea.  Why don't we take the famous snes initiation code, and add the addition of a default color palette, default sprite and bg pattern table and default vram memory arrangement settings.<br /><br />How's this as a default setting:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">sprites: 8x8 and 16x16<br />bg mode: 1, with high priority bg3<br /><br />vram layout:<br />$0000 sprite patterns<br />$2000 bg1 map (64x64)<br />$3000 bg2 map (64x64)<br />$4000 bg1 &amp; bg2 patterns<br />$6c00 bg3 map (32x32)<br />$7000 bg3 patterns<br /><br /></div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'll look into the code.<br /><br />I want to know how you are assembling the code.  Is it just a bunch of .asm files being assembled to a ROM individually, or are they using &quot;includes.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Here's a question for others on this website.  Is there a &quot;correct&quot; way to use NMI interrupts?  In the last couple of projects I've been using an IRQ interrupt in the place of an NMI, because NMI interrupts could trigger late when the CPU is busy, causing a black bar to appear at the top of the screen, instead of the usual slowdown.  If you keep the NMI interrupt flag set, it can interrupt the CPU while it's not finished with a frame, causing glitches, unless you reserve a byte of memory to signal if the frame is finished or not.<br /><br />EDIT:  Your code RTL after it clears wram.  That would cause crashing, due to the stack being swiped out.

Graphics should be stored in the $81xxxx and $82xxxx ROM banks, since each ROM bank is 32kB, it takes 2 banks to fill up 64kB of vram.  I use xkas, if anyone has issues with wla or another assembler.  If anyone finds a mistake, please tell me, and I'll fix it.<br /><br />EDIT:  No wonder nobody responded.  I made two mistakes.  The first is setting $2100 to $1f instead of $8f, the second is dma-ing both banks to address $0000 in VRAM.  I'll post a correct version when I get home.<br /><br />EDIT 2: Uploaded the corrected version.  Hope people find this useful.
