		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Which video format would be "better" for posting updates to my emulator site?  I have two best options right now that work best with the VGA frame grabber that I'm using.  WMV format using Windows media encoder.  Or an XVID-based AVI format using the software that came with my frame grabber.
<br />
<br />Is one a much better option than the other or doesn't it really matter?  I think both formats are pretty popular/common myself but I'm wondering what everyone else thinks.
<br />
<br />If someone wants to suggest another format/codec that's fine but I can't promise that I will be able to generate it.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":-P" title="Razz" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Lossless H.264 is a good intermediate format, and can be encoded using ffdshow/ffvfw, but that's probably not supported by your frame grabber software.
<br />
<br />While XviD, or MPEG-4 ASP, is probably more widely supported, H.264 does produce higher quality encodes for similar bitrate, or lower bitrate for similar quality. Although if you do decide to go with H.264, do not use the Flash Media Encoder to compress it, the included H.264 encoder is absolute crap.
<br />
<br />The recommended encoder for H.264 is x264, and I also recommend sticking with the default encoding profile of "medium" and only adjusting the target bitrate, or even just using a quantizer quality level instead. Higher quality presets can take anywhere from 2x to 50x as long to encode, and probably for an unnoticeable improvement in quality.

<br />I don't think YouTube videos look particularly good, but if the general public is anything like me, they won't download AVI or WMV files of something they're not sure is interesting, but if you embed a YouTube video most of them would click the PLAY button.
<br />
<br />So I'm saying that whatever CODEC you use (and I've heard that H.264 uploaded to YouTube works great for games), make sure you make it available at YouTube as well, or anything else that requires just a click to watch.

<br />"From what I can see the main objection to Theora is the submarine patent issue. Theora is not 'patent-free'. Rather all known patents relating to it have been released to the public. Submarine patents are those which are unknown. They refer to the practice of keeping quiet about a patent on a technology until some company with a large amount of money implements it. Then the patent holder surfaces and attempts to get large amounts of money for it." - <a href="http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/2007/12/video-element-and-ogg-theora.html" class="postlink">BLUISH CODER</a>

You snooze, you lose.</div><br /><br />I was just clarifying the patent issue with Theora, as many people are unaware On2 did not own all the patents on VP3. There are at least two known companies that have patents that never released their patents and heaven knows how many submarine ones are out there (Although this is true and a risk with any software). I think I read somewhere that the xiph foundation is/was trying to secure any/all possible patents that they do not own. I have no link for that info so I could be remembering it wrong. BTW it would not be the web browser companies at main risk but companies selling/releasing videos in the specified video format. If major companies released movies and such in Theora we could easily get widespread adoption, but the problem is that they have no guarantees that they would not get in trouble down the road. Personally I think it is just pointless paranoid fears, but of course it is not like I am putting my money on the line. Good thing about Dirac is that it has already had some adoption in terms of major HD broadcasting (Beijing Olympics), which to my knowledge has not happened with Theora. Companies are more likely to back Dirac if it is used more in broadcasting. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">"tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Comparison shows that Dirac is not there yet.

<br />
<br />Unfortunately all current wavelet video encoders <a href="http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/?p=317#more-317" class="postlink">suck</a> compared to DTCs, but at least Dirac has the most promise, if fully implemented in a well done encoder. It maybe able to even compete realistically with x264, but I might be way too optimistic here. Theora/VP3 will never be able to realistically compete with a well done H 264 encoder in terms of quality over compression, although it can beat crappy encoders like apple's easily (But so can Xvid). Google recently brought On2, so maybe if they open VP8 like was done to VP3 (many speculate that this was Google's plan to begin with), we might get a free/open video format that is a realistic rival to H.264. Widespread adoption would also be easy as Google owns youtube and can just release all videos as VP8s <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is all pretty interesting stuff.
<br />
<br />Is there any particular format that lends itself better to being able to to insert little title screens in between captures?  Can someone suggest a software package?
<br />
<br />For example, I want to record the output (audio and video) from my NES-FPGA using my frame grabber and my sound card.  I would record the output of one ROM, pause capture, swap ROMs, record the output the new ROM, pause capture, and so on...to make one single file.
<br />
<br />Then I would like to be able to insert just a few second title screen in between each ROM capture that has a short little description of which ROM it is and what it tests (or something like that).  If I can figure out what tools to use and how to do this I think I will pretty much have everything I need for all of my NES progress updates from here on out! Can someone point me in the right direction?  I don't need anything fancy.  A free option is of course the nicest option, but I'm willing to pay as well.
<br />
<br />Thanks for all the info guys!
<br />

<br />
<br />Pretty much anything can do this. Heck, you can tell ffmpeg, a command-line video transcoder, to cut images &amp; video with enough CLI variables.
<br />
<br />My personal recommendation would be one of the "top dogs" in video editing, like Adobe Premiere or Sony Vegas, where they do have basic splicing &amp; overlays built in, but can be taken further if needed down the road.
<br />
<br />If you're looking for a free solution, Windows has a movie maker built in that can do that (and gets a pretty bad rep because of how it 'works').
<br />
<br />If you are looking for a free solution other than WMM I've had some sucess with a little program called avidemux in the past for basic copy pasta stuff.
<br />
<br />There's of course better free tools, but just for splicing titles I've found it's best to keep it as basic as possible, without limiting yourself too much.
