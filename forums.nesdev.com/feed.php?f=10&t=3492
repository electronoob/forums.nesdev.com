<title type="html"><![CDATA[Yobo Strikes Again!]]></title>

As we all know, Yobo's Famiclones are not 100% compatible, even though the underlying NES-on-a-chip is reasonably sound.  Among the reasons for this is thaty the Yobo devices do not bring the /CIRAM line to the cartridge edge.  Games that manipulate this line, usually for 4-screen mirroring or MMC5 games, will not work right on their NES and Famiclones.  <br /><br />Well, guess what.  I bought a 72-60 pin cartridge converter off ebay recently and got it today.  Turns out it was a Yobo brand converter, obviously for use in their Famiclones.  THose games that don't work in the Famiclone will not work with this converter.  It seems Yobo decided to tie the /CIRAM pin with the /CHR WR pin, as is the case on most cartridges.  While I like the converter, the pins to the Famicom are too small and too close to other traces to perform a solder wiring fix.  I suppose its the Yobo motto: "If it won't work in our machines, it won't work in anybody else's either."<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> â€” Tue Jul 17, 2007 2:31 pm</p><hr />
