Yeah, for now, that's the only way I'm aware that's completely safe. That's a hard thing to guarantee in my programs though (i.e. that sprites won't be at the place where rendering is disabled), so I'd rather not do it at all.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Jul 02, 2011 4:11 pm</p><hr />

I think the main tip was, don't have any sprites where you're going to disable ppu rendering. The exact specifics of the bug are up for debate.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Sat Jul 02, 2011 3:43 pm</p><hr />

Alright, I'll have to look into it then. I have an older copy of FCEUX, which only has the scanline counter, no pixel counter.<br /><br />In the meantime, I think StarTropics II wouldn't be affected by the glitch as terribly, because it turns rendering <em>back on</em> for the status bar (duh! Why didn't I think of it before?), and even though the status bar has sprites on it, they're the first six sprites, which are supposedly the only ones that cause the glitch in the first place. If they're stationary, ALWAYS under the blanked out region, then the glitch is averted.<br /><br />This is assuming that it's only the first six sprites that cause the oam glitch. Blargg only mentioned it in a post about him testing whether the corrupted sprites can be predicted, so I don't know if it's ONLY the first six sprites that can ever cause the glitch, or if it was only just because of that specific test.<br /><br />Also, I don't know if anyone knows what this is, but has anyone noticed SMB occasionally spits out a garbage scanline? I've noticed this on my actual cart, and so has Acmlm (who even caught a screenshot of it with his capture card device gizmo doodle), but no emulators will do this. Yesterday, I was playing Kid Icarus, and when I got to the horizontally scrolling stages (2-1 through 2-3), I was seeing weird scanlines a lot, which is strange because I've never seen them in Kid Icarus before, nor have I seen them in Goonies 1 or 2, which are also horizontally scrolling games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Sat Jul 02, 2011 1:29 pm</p><hr />

Ok, so about the sprite glitch, I've gone over the thread again and again.<br /><br />You need to disable rendering between pixels 64-255, and when you disable, you'll cause a strange hardware bug that corrupts a pair of sprites, but only if one of the first six sprites (so sprites 0-5) overlaps the scanline <em>after</em> the one you disable rendering on.<br /><br />The effect is a seemingly random section of 8 bytes will be overwritten with whatever section of 8 bytes 2003 is pointing to.<br /><br />I went to my old standby, Startropics II, because the dungeon sections feature PPU render disabling in order to upload new colors for the status bar. Mike never overlaps the section of the status bar that's blanked, his entire sprite disappears when he's about to. The same thing with any sprites that reach that part of the screen, they disappear right before they're about to overlap. I guess this is how this game avoids the bug. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to determine which pixel the scanline is disabled on, since fceux doesn't have a PPU cycle counter.<br /><br />Another game to check would be Krusty's Fun House. If I remember correctly, it disables rendering mid-frame, and sprites are allowed to overlap the blanked section.<br /><br />The 2007 scrolling quirk, that may be just be down to playing around with test roms to figure it out. For now though, I'll just assume it'll increment fine h/v scrolling depending on the status of the 1/32 byte increment bit of $2000.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Fri Jul 01, 2011 8:06 pm</p><hr />

Disabling sprite rendering while leaving background rendering enabled, or disabling background rendering while leaving sprite rendering enabled, has no effect on the operation of the PPU's rendering.

There are two new quirks with the ppu that I don't understand.<br /><br />First is the sprite oam glitch when you turn off rendering early. I'm under the impression that you cannot disable rendering on a scanline that has sprites on it, unless you turn it off sometime after ppu cycle 64 and before hblank. Otherwise, you risk corrupting one of the sprites on the next frame. Is this correct? Also, does the glitch still occur if you turn off sprites, and then turn off the bg on the next scanline?<br /><br />Second is the young indiana jones discovery. Reading $2007 during rendering will increment fine H or fine V counters, depending on whether 1 byte or 32 byte increment is set? I don't care about how to implement this on an emulator (and thus don't feel like contending with the original thread), I want to make sure I understand the basic principle behind it, since I'm not even sure why the hardware behaves like this.<br /><br />If anyone could clarify these things for me, I'd greatly appreciate it and add it to the wiki.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Wed Jun 22, 2011 9:49 am</p><hr />
