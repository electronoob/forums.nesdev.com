Some day, I need to port QuickNES to DOS to see if it can compete with Nesticle in the speed department. My current Windows build requires Windows 2000 (only because it's a Unicode build) and at least MMX for the NTSC filter.<br /><br />I could try building a bare version of the library with a benchmark application to see the minimum frame rate it would achieve on a given system.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=139">kode54</a> — Mon Oct 05, 2009 4:39 pm</p><hr />

I remember an older version of loopynes being even faster than NESticle, especially after an unplanned migration from a 66mhz 486/dx2 to 25mhz 486/sx.  Maybe that was before good scrolling emulation.<br /><br />I didn't stop using DOS until '00 or '01.

Well you get a pretty high end if you got a X2 in 2005, it was just out or something. Glad it worked well for you. I don't remember why I picked a regular Athlon in 2006, maybe I took it because it was cheap and I was pretty broke back then ? Before that I used to have a VERY old PC like a pentium 1 - class I don't really remember it was baretly able to do very slow SNES emulation. Heh it's fun I should do a list of all PCs I've used with their specs and all so when I'll be old I'll look at the long list and see how stuff have evolued and say myself "oh my god".<br /><br />And yeah Celius it's weird GBA emulation would slow down if you upgraded your video card. You'd think at worst it wouldn't change a thing. I'm not sure if GBA games takes advantage of a GPU or not, however PS1 &amp; PS2 emulation DOES take advantage of a powerfull graphic card to speed up things, probably why it didn't work on my old PC which had a "passive" silent graphic cards (and a *very* noisy CPU fan, which make no sense at all, but hey it's over now). <br /><br /><br />I'm really surprised to see how much people were able to emulate PS1 for a long time. I really remember it was a pain configuring the graphic plug-in, there were a LOT of glitches, and slowdowns. Even the sound FX were off, but now it seems fixed, either because of my better PC, or because they updated the plugins, or both. <br /><br />About MSNA, it doesn't make sense. Microsoft licence their software for free to their students. They can't force them to only use it for academic stuff, if they think students will use a PC for assiting them in their studies and another for personal hobbies stuff with a different copy of Windows, they're just completely off. <br /><br />@Celius : Even my old 486 PC can do NES emulation with Nesticle (it does frame skip tough). That's kinda fun to think I *actually* used to play NES games like that back then.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Oct 05, 2009 8:28 am</p><hr />

What I was told by my school was that you can get the software when your a student, and you can keep it after you're done, but you won't receive any updates or anything like that. It's pretty much like you were saying, I guess. It's supposed to be used for academic purposes, but I don't see how MS could enforce that either. It would inconvenience them too much to check each student's saved work, and contact the school to talk to them about it. Still, the MSDNAA membership is very nice to have for free, as I was told it was a thousand dollars or something that the school had to pay for it for each student.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />My old PC was 3.5 years old, and had :<br />- Little slowdown with GBA, but major slowdown when VRAM viewer was enabled with auto refresh<br />- Major slowdown with DS emulation (no game were playable)<br />- Major graphic issues with PSX emulation, and much slow down too.<br />- I haven't tried PS2 emulations, but seeing how it's really on the edge with my new PC, I guess it wouldn't have worked at all.<br /></div><br /><br />I actually had some strange problems with my last PC (it isn't currently working, but I think it's fixable still) in terms of emulation. PSX emulation was pretty much flawless for me. There was never any slow-down or anything, and that PC was from 2004. DS and GBA emulation, however, were terrible. For a while I was able to run some games on the GBA emulator, but then I changed my graphics card and it was being very slow (which is weird, seeing that my new graphics card was an improvement from the previous one). DS games I could never play, and PS2 games were basically slide shows. I think I had either 1 or 2 GB of RAM (For some reason, I'm thinking 1). Actually, PS2 games crashed my PC lots of times, I think because it tried to use too much RAM.<br /><br />The current computer I am using could not run any of the things mentioned, and sound doesn't even work on it. I'm surprised it can run a NES emulator, haha.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Oct 04, 2009 5:54 pm</p><hr />

For now, Windows 7 reacts very quickly to everything, as Microsoft adwised it to. With the auto windows update I was able to get some drivers, so I'm almost definitely stucking to Windows 7. Even if it's ture it's ridiculous it uses 800 MB or RAM when Windows 2k I've used for the last 7 years uses only 80 MB, but hey that's called technology improvement. Honnestly, as much as I like retro stuff and all, I think it would really suck if computer didn't evolve, and I'm glad we get new very powerful technologies. Not counting it matains many great jobs for companies such as Intel, AMD, ATI, Microsoft, ..... Honestly it should be cool to work in order to create technology that is always surpassing the current trend in order to get more and more powerfull computers.<br /><br />For tokumary, how slow an OS is when it comes to booting, shutting down and launching programms mostly due to it's hard drive's slowness, and have few to do with CPU power and RAM amount. CPU power and RAM amount is significant if your games lag or something like that.<br /><br />It your OS makes about a minue to boot, it's because it have to load megabyte of stuff from the slow hard drive to the fast RAM before using it. So if you have some spare $400 you could get a SSD for your computer and theorically it will be very fast, launch programms in a matter of miliseconds, and as a plus consumes less power. IMHO, in a couple of years, SSDs will be much less expensive, regular hard drives will be considered old pieces of obsolete crap and all new computers will be equiped with SSDs, which will be a great thing.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Oct 02, 2009 3:17 am</p><hr />

The start menu was one of the few things I liked about vista, and now 7. I like the fact that it scrolls your list of programs up and down rather than filling your screen with them. I find it compact and more efficient.<br /></div><br /><br />Compact, yes, I agree. But since I was always ordering all my shortcuts (and still doing it in win7), it never covered completely my screen like some horror I saw in some customers computer while doing tech support.<br /><br />One of my issue is the fact it's so slllooowww to react. If there is a way to make it snappy, I guess I would like it more. For winxp, if you use tweakui, you can even tweak the time the menu react to make it faster.  Maybe I should check if there is something for that menu. I would like to mouse over the folder and it open fast.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Fri Oct 02, 2009 1:22 am</p><hr />

The cost of PC133 + Labor to install isn't worth the value of the computer. I don't even think I can find a local source to sell me PC133.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=493">Super-Hampster</a> — Thu Oct 01, 2009 6:42 pm</p><hr />
