If you're not scrolling though, or scrolling in only one direction, you could just as easily use H/V mirroring and still have the possibility of borrowing name table bytes for extra patterns.

That's basically what I meant by &quot;abusing the mirroring&quot;.<br /><br />BTW, do you have a version of your emulator up for download that supports the single chip cart?

To get it emulated, the game needs to be declared as &quot;mapper 218&quot;, with the mirroring selected via the iNES H/V bit and the 4-screen bit misused as 1-screen bit (sorry, I know that not everybody liked that definition, but then there haven't been too many people favoring other options (*), so I've did stick with that definition).<br />(*) aside from the NROM/AOROM solution... that was actually favored by many people... but I really-really wanted an own mapper number for it, sorry there.<br /><br />Oh, and I've updated the <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/magicflr.htm">http://nocash.emubase.de/magicflr.htm</a><!-- m --> demo game, the ROM-image is now marked as mapper 218, so no$nes v1.1 will handle it as such (which, for that game, basically means that you can see the special NT/CHR mirrorings in the VRAM viewer).

You display them individually by using different palettes.  The trick is using the 'extra' color when a pixel appears in both tiles, so your NES tile usage is such: transparent, tile1color, tile2color, tile1&amp;2color.  While the actual palette you send to the PPU would look like:<br />set 1 - BG, color1, BG, color1<br />set 2 - BG, BG, color2, color2.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Shiru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Just a random thought. Isn't an ATMega MCU fast enough and has enough pins to emulate a ROM for NES, i.e. put requested data from internal ROM on data bus pins as fast as needed? It probably can also act as CIC.<br /><br />ATMega64 could be enough for this application (32K for PRG, 32K for AVR code), and its price is under $10, which is a bit less than thousands.</div><br /><br />I actually previously thought of doing that with the Propeller MCU (with 8 32-bit cores, it's an odd one).. I coded a small part of it it (never built the hardware) and it would have been fast enough for PRG, but unfortunately was a little too slow for CHR.  CIC was not possible because that MCU must always bootload (it's RAM based), so you have to wait 500msec on powerup.  I mostly wanted it for CHR, PRG wasn't interesting enough, so I ditched it.  But if the Prop2 is ever produced (and is faster), it could become a potentially very powerful CHR-RAM.  Those CPUs can have zero latency for this because instead of needing to poll or have an interrupt, you just have a dedicated CPU core run a &quot;wait until input equals&quot; instruction.  But imagine your CHR RAM having multiple 6502 cores (emulated) inside it.. why not move metatile rendering into it, or have entire level data in it and have the NES write scroll values to it, or perhaps another core could handle hit detection if you sent it object coordinates.  Instead of dual-port, it's like octo-port memory.  I better leave something for the NES to do, hehe.<br /><br />I'm not familiar with ATMega at all, but with the PIC32 I believe if you're willing to write branch-less code (just a string of LDA #xx / STA $2007 can be useful), it should be possible for PIC32 to feed code/data directly to the NES via DMA transfers to it's parallel port, which would free up the PIC32 CPU for other tasks.  Perhaps that could work on chykyn's ENIO CPU board.

Only problem is the worst limitation that cannot be circumvented, the 13 color limit and attributes <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Would be interesting on a SNES though in mode 7.  Use a cart based MCU to do whatever you want and just write the result to the mode 7 linear frame buffer straight to VRAM via B bus.  Console itself just acting as a display DAC and input processor really.
