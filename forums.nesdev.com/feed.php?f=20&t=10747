I'm a little wary of just providing you a solution if this is for your degree work; surely you should be proving you know how to design something here?<br /><br />Anyway, here's a hint:<br />Use a 74'138. Connect /RD and /WR to A and B, and connect CPU A15..A13 (and optionally A12) to the other four inputs to be active when reading or writing from 0xA000 through (0xAFFF or 0xBFFF). Only two of the outputs will be useful.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Tue Dec 03, 2013 3:59 pm</p><hr />

The gameboy doesn't have the ability (unlike the GBA in ARM mode) to use the address bus as anything other than an 16-bit-address 8-bit-data bus, all the time.<br /><br />Also, in your board, you <em>really</em> should connect <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">GB /RD</tt> to <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">ROM /OE</tt>, and <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">GB A15</tt> to <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">ROM /CE</tt>.

You should be able to add some number of 74'161 or 74'377 (or similar) to get up to 23 different GPIO lines, by connecting /WR and A15 to the latch IC's &quot;CP&quot; and &quot;/E&quot; or &quot;/PE&quot;, and any 4 or more lines of A0..A14 D0..D7 to the latch IC's D0..D7. This would let your software write a value to anywhere in the lower 32KiB of memory to put some digital values on the latch outputs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Tue Dec 03, 2013 12:52 pm</p><hr />

When you read or write an address that ends in 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, C, or D, A1 becomes 0. When you read or write an address that ends in 2, 3, 6, 7, A, B, E, or F, A1 becomes 1.<br /><br />But if you're trying to control a peripheral based on the address lines alone, remember that all low-order address lines will fluctuate based on reads from ROM and reads from and writes to RAM. You have to decode addresses by matching the values of several address lines at once.

Hi there,<br />my friend and I are currently on a project for school. I don't want to get too much into details, but it's about a GPS and air pressure sensor module which sends the data to the gameboy. <br />Currently we have a simple circuit board, just an EPROM connected to the pins on the Gameboy (can be viewed on attachement).<br />We already coded some programs (simple games, color text, etc) with the Gameboy Code Editor and the GBDK and transferred it to the EPROM - worked like a charm. <br />Now comes the tricky part:<br />For our project, we need to access to the Address Bus (A0 - A15) via the program on the EPROM. That means, we have to be able to set a certain Address line (e.g. A1) to either 1 or 0.<br />We have been looking for hours, but still couldn't find some commands or hints. We would be very grateful if anyone could provide us some information  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br />Many thanks in advance<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6282">Monster704</a> — Tue Dec 03, 2013 12:25 pm</p><hr />
