I have attached a LA trace from when the SNES was doing the garbage video output.  I suspect that the sound module (that the CPU seems to fail to get a response from) is causing it to crash in such a way as to leave weird stuff in the video ram.  I know the sound module works fine because I have tested it in another working SNES.

Is it possible that the CPURD and CPURW lines transition faster then the SYSCK line preventing my LA from picking them up?  I have attached the LA trace from when it does the garbage colored blocks that you see in the video.  I am starting to suspect that one of the chips is in latchup on the outputs or inputs.

I don't know if this idea would work but could I use a Arduino and some shift registers to simulate the CPU and try to get the PPU chips to do something?  Or would this not work due to the clock signals as well as other signals that I would not be able to easily replicate with this setup?  I was thinking of just controlling the address and data lines with the setup and holding the SNES CPU in reset.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have found an interesting discovery in that if I disconnect resistor R74 that allows the PPU to reset the CPU, cart and sound module and trigger my LA off the XIN clock instead of the SYSCK I get the CPURD and CPUWR lines to show up again.  The heading SYSCK1 in the attached LA traces is actually SYSCK on the SNES.  In the first trace the PPUs are not in reset and in the second one they are.  The tests were done with the Super Mario All-Stars cart and the sound module installed.  Also I have just realized that the PPUs have just a 8bit address bus and a 8bit data bus as well as a read and write control lines as well as HBLANK, VBLANK, and EXTLATCH.  I am wondering how I would convert the 0x2100 to 0x213f registers into a 8bit value that the PPUs would understand?  I think these are the values that the CPU is expecting on the address &quot;A&quot; bus but what comes out on the &quot;PA&quot; bus?  Would I be correct in thinking that the &quot;B&quot; address bus is what is labeled in the color SNES schematic as CA16 to CA23?  Also can I ignore the HBLANK, VBLANK, and EXTLATCH on PPU2 for now?  I know some Arduino programming and would be able to probably get this to work if I could figure out what hex or binary values I would need to send to the PPUs for them to work.  I am more of a hardware kind of guy not a software one but will learn the software bit if I have to.  Also I am a beginner at SNES programing so I am sorry if some of my questions come across as stupid.  I am also still learning how to best use my LA as well as I have only been using it for a few weeks and have had no formal training on how to properly use one (except from what I read from the users manual that was somewhat hard to understand).

I have had a ton of luck with old NES consoles, but SNES... no luck.<br /><br />I get the same problem as you: black screen of death.  The system powers up just fine.  I have replaced all caps, same thing.  Switched around sound cards and other pieces from working systems, and nothing has helped.<br /><br />I will follow this conversation.  I really hope to solve this problem... I have thrown away quite a few boards in frustration due to not being able to fix them.  I still have a couple that I have hope for though...<br /><br />Good luck.

Will take a look at the controller test program and also capture what is being sent to the PPUs when I get that blocky flashy screen so that I can try to replicate that.  I am just not sure if the Arduino is going to be fast enough or if the speed of the data going in doesn't mater as long as it is correct and is in the VRAM.
