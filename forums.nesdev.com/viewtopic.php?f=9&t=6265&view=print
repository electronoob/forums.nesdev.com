		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have an old Famiclone from 1990 that is a complete hardware clone of a Famicom and not a NOAC. 
<br />
<br />I opened it up recently and noticed that has socketed connectors for its CPU and PPU. Since its chips it uses are clones and not as good as the real thing, I want to drop in the chips I have on an NES that has a dead power supply. 
<br />
<br />Is there a way to easily remove the NES CPU and PPU? I think I've heard there are tools designed to do this. Can anyone shed some light on this? The more info the better. Thanks.

And there's unpowered spring-loaded ones around, I haven't used one but they are cheaper.
<br />
<br />One thing the wikipedia article didn't mention is that often to desolder through-hole, you have to add more solder.  No matter what tool, you won't be taking anything off if there's not enough solder for it to flow properly and completely (and there rarely is for professionally assembled stuff).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If there's no power, have you checked if the regulator is bad?  It's part 7805, a 3-pin IC which is screwed to a heatsink.  If that's the problem, it will cost less than a dollar to replace and you can remove that with a soldering iron because you can heat all 3 pins at the same time.
<br />
<br />I have spare PPUs, but AFAIK a CPU will cost as much as the whole system.
<br />
<br />On another thread I mentioned the website digchip.com.  There are resellers on there that claim to have CPUs and PPUs in stock, but I have no idea what they want for them, and until you ask for a quote you have no idea who you're dealing with and if you're even getting real chips rather than ones dug out of the trash from the IC foundry or whatnot.
<br />
<br />If you try what peppers said, you may want to practice on a cartridge or something else besides the CPU.  Desoldering braid doesn't have enough suction to easily pull the solder (it has to remove all the solder from both sides of the board and completely surrounding the pin).
<br />
<br />The manual desoldering pump might be about $20 or so at Radio Shack.  I've seen some where you squeeze a rubber bulb to pump air, and others with a spring-loaded mechanism that you just trigger.

<br />
<br />Super-Hampster is right, just plugging in the chips to your clone wont necessarily work, there is a good chance they have different pin-outs.

<br />I was thinking about that too. Before dropping the Nintendo ICs there I would follow some traces to figure out the pinouts of the cloned ICs, because if they differ you might end up frying something.

<br />
<br />I like the spring action pumps, but you have to clean them and use some vaseline to maintain maximum suction. I just clean and lube it when I'm done for the day so it's ready for the next time. The trigger is nice for me because I can desolder without three hands then.

<br />if you want something maybe faster on the cheap I remember reading about how some people have made a hot air device out of a desoldering iron and aquarium pumps/tubing, you'll have to find it though and I can not vouch for how well it works

<br />
<br />Oh, and Memblers, get your NES CPUs from Mike's Arcade for $5 US. They're 2A03H from suposedly the last ever batch.
