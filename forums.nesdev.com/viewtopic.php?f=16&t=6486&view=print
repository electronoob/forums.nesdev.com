<br />
<br />Current users (spammers excluded) have already been promoted to trusted. 
<br />
<br />You can now create a account but it gives you no rights at all, not even posting in your talk page (you could still post spam there, I'm that strict). Once your account is created, you must ask on this forum to be promoted. 
<br />It may be strict but now the bright side is: no more annoying capcha.
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />I found the user in the list, my mistake. Etabeta is now promoted to trusted user.
<br />
<br />If you find any issue with the wiki because of the new rights, please let us know.

<br />
<br />Like Blargg said, they will have to go to the trouble of coming here and create an account and then ask to be promoted to be able to write spam that we will remove right away. I guess that's quite a waste of time from a spammer point of view.
<br />
<br />The only thing I should keep the re-capatcha thought is for account creation... The "Mark2web" that was just created just feel like a bot created one. Maybe the captcha is useful at the least for this case.  
<br />
<br />I will re-activate it for account creation next week since I cannot have access to the server this weekend.

Should use of the nesdevWiki forum as the counterpart to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Edit_protected" class="postlink">Wikipedia's {{edit protected}} template</a> be encouraged or discouraged?
<br />
<br />Should we set out a step-by-step procedure for applying for 'trusted' status? We'd have to set out guidelines for two things: <ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Procedure to verify that a BBS user should in fact be trusted on the wiki, for which I'd recommend counting on-topic posts in the user's posting history on the BBS. </li><li>Procedure to verify that a recently created wiki user account is the same person as a BBS user and not a spammer who created wiki accounts with the same name as all high-post-count BBS users. </li></ol>

If someone has been active here for a few weeks and would like wiki access, create his account. If that doesn't work, we can work something else out, like having him PM for the password to his new account.

<br />
<br />We should just make clear the procedure to get trusted:
<br />
<br />- update the wiki main page to explain to whom you should send the PM for being trusted
<br />- put a sticky in the wiki thread about how to create an account
<br />
<br />There was a message on the top page in the new section but it seems nobody read it. It said to post on the nesdev bbs regarding how to be trusted. Every time there was a new user, I was posting them PM personally to confirm it was really them that wanted to create that account. I don't mind to do that since spam was removed completely. And with the rate of new account, this is not an issue.
<br />
<br />Just make the procedure clearer, this is the only thing required. Don't add some kind of automation thingy, that's going overboard.

<br />
<br />- Create your account on the wiki
<br />- send a PM to Tepples, Memblers or me about the account
<br />- once PM received, your account will be put in the trusted group
