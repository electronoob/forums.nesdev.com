<br />Not anything to do with TQROM. Actually, I think there should be a "standard" assignation with mappers wich nonstandard configuration, as long as the iNES 2.0 header exists.
<br />iNES 2.0 can technically have a game with MMC3 + 8k CHRRAM + 32k batteried RPGRAM or something like that, but since no commercial games ever had that, there is no official way to emulate it either.
<br />I think there should be a standard sytem that should improve this situation, based on what the few Famicom and NES games using standard mappers with nonstandard configuration does. This system should in no way break the compatibitily with any existing game (at least any commercial one).
<br />The system would tell wich adress lines would be used for any combination of more RPGROM (a.ka. SUROM, SXROM), more PRG RAM (a.k.a. SOROM, SXROM), more CHR RAM (no known board), and/or CHR ROM + CHR RAM (TQROM).
<br />I think when more CHR RAM is present, it should be banked like normal (i.e. CHRROM), exept it's RAM instead. When more PRG ROM or PRG RAM are present, they should be banked with some of the higher adress bits. When a 74HC32 (or similar logic) is used to select a CHR ROM or a CHR RAM, another higher CHR adress bit should be used. Wich bits are used when is a hot subject, however I think "hypotetical" boards shouldn't be rejected as opposed to "real" boards, as long as credible backward compatibility with "real" boards is fully assured.

<br />If you are interested, here's a really cool interview I did that kind of kickstarted this whole process:

The info I have on the NWC doesn't show 6:21 as a possible DIP setting.  If the switches are set to 0100, the time is 6:15, and if they're set to 0101 the time is 6:34.

<br />I was confused about that too, but just guessed they measure from a different starting point.  The official contest time is marked as 6:15 on the gray cart, typically quoted at 6:21, and takes 6:22 stopwatch time from hitting the start button to the time over screen appearing.

I (finally) found the ROM today (don't nobody ask aboit it!!), and I have yet to get around to testing or looking at it.  If the timer doesn't begin ticking until ~6 seconds after the start button is pressed, then that would explain everything.

<br />
<br />The times on the cartridge are only approximate.  I'm guessing that the programmers made the timer based on clock cycles of the system...maybe the formula they used was off by a bit over a span of minutes...like about 1 second per minute, a small amount of time.  The label time is simply incorrect.  In fact, the timer at the real competition started at 6:21 and counted down.
