<br />
<br />If you want clarification of what's shown in the videos or need some help translating/understanding things, just post a reply and I'll try to get an explanation up.
<br />
<br />P.S. -- The video with Rockman 2 in it (oldest video, 5:55 mark) -- because I'm sure someone will bring it up -- uses an optical illusion.  Using sprites for the building windows and ledges, the sprites are moved downward on their Y-axis (incremented) while the actual background is panned vertically at a slower rate.  The result = optical illusion of panning upwards.  :-)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />With today's emulators, which include so many debugging features, it's pretty easy to figure out how these effects are pulled off. You can disable/enable sprites, look at the unmodified tilemap, look at the patterns to see if they are being modified, and step through the code that manipulates everything.
<br />
<br />Still, it would be nice if there was a sort of "guide" for these kinds of effects, with screenshots/videos and detailed explanations about how they work (I'm not really sure what these videos contain, I can't watch them). That would be a wonderful addition to our wiki. I would certainly want to contribute with some info on games I have personally researched, like <em>Bucky O'Hare</em>.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm a little surprised the videos didn't have sprite priority "stuff" shown, like at the very start of CV1 (main castle doorway), and the "swamp" of CV2.  A lot of emulators got those wrong, resulting in Simon walking into the castle wall (literally) in CV1, and the lower half of his body being visible in CV2.
<br />
<br />So yeah, it would be neat to compile all the tricks into a page where it might give upcoming programmers ideas.

<br />Well if there is anything really interesting and new, please tell us. I already knew about the MM2 trick and I admit it's really impressive. By the way I think it should be possible to actually do something similar with one BG layer with really narrow $2006 writes midscanline. You'd need a "black zone" to compensate the CPU/PPU alignment jittering though.

<br />Video sites often leave a .flv or .mp4 file in your temporary internet files folder if you use IE. If the video really contains anything new or interesting (as opposed to just a raw capture of the game's video), you guys who managed to register could re-upload the video for the rest of us to watch.

<br />Battletoads used a similar technique to get parallax scrolling in certain stages (like the cave level).
<br />
<br />Same with Metal Storm, except Metal Storm did it with CHR bankswitching instead of CHR-RAM!

<br />
<br />They discuss raster effect "stuff" (e.g. changing video modes mid-scanline, and a bunch of other things) in the later (more recent) videos (mainly covering Megadrive, SFC, and PCE).  It greatly depends on the console.  The NES/FC videos didn't discuss any raster stuff.
