		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Congratulations! Well done, i love the fluid animation. <img src="./images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" /> <br /><br /><br />Some thoughts on possible changes:<br /><br />-Maybe add a unique &quot;egg in belly&quot; tile for when it was swallowed right in a 90 degree turn?<br />-The music is a good start, but gets grating after a short while since the loop is so short.<br />-When the snake has gotten very long, if you die, it takes quite a while for the retry message to appear <br />-Maybe a countdown on eggs until next level rather than amount of eggs swallowed would be more informative + slightly nerve wracking. Especially with that delay between swallowing and being extended. <br />-Maybe introduce the &quot;cherry&quot; to vary gameplay. The exact mechanics are up to you, but it could disappear after some timer runs out or if you take the egg first. Normally, a cherry would grant points, but there are no points except a record on how long you got the snake. It could count towards that score/goal without elongating the snake? Sounds like a suitable reward for risking your life for a time-limited bonus.<br />-Maybe one of the action buttons could speed up the snake a bit? (use at own risk).

The head and tails are (for technical reasons) movable shapes, and I'm a bit short of OAM shapes!<br /><br /><img src="http://www.chateau31.com/yvar/movables.bmp" alt="Image" /><br /><br />However, running my shape deduplicator on it, with detection of mirror and flip, shows that 36 of the 256 shapes are (indirectly) duplicates...<br /><br /><img src="http://www.chateau31.com/yvar/uniques.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />So as soon as I have those deduplicated, I can start to add more animation... <br />To be more specific, I can add 1 animation sequence for 4 directions (32 shapes i.e. 8 steps * 4 directions), and then I keep 4 movable shapes for things like cherries, baskets, ect...<br /><br />So what do you prefer? An sequence where the snake's head opens its mouth to eat an egg? Or maybe something else?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Pretty cool, although the sound could use a bit of work. It sounds really basic to me.<br /><br />On that note, here's a test to see if I could get DevSound (my own Game Boy music system) to work in your game. I mostly succeeded, although there are a few issues. First of all, DevSound expects to have full control over the sound chip, so it ends up corrupting the sound effects. Secondly, the music no longer increases in speed when the game does. Deliberately slowing down the call rate for music playback (which is what your sound code did) is not sufficient as DevSound needs to be called on <em>every</em> frame in order for the music to sound correct. Finally, the music constantly pauses. I tried to fix the latter issue, but I wasn't able to due to not wanting to spend too much time.<br /><br />By the way, I noticed that you're following your halts with nops. This isn't necessary; the assembler will automatically insert a nop after each halt opcode.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Nice tune! <br />I first thought a simple game wouldn't be very demanding on the matter of sound, but indeed that is pretty cool  <img src="./images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" /> .<br /><br />To make the sound effects work, one simple solution would be to simply disable channel 4 in the music engine since all sound effects are made to work with channel 4. The sound effects are very plain ones, with no real code behind, but I don't know how the SFX works in your music engine. I will try to set up 1 unified sound effect trigger routine once I get home, that would make things a bit easier.<br /><br />For the speedup, <span style="color: #008800">[v_speed]</span> contains the current speed of the game; if I would know where the current song speed is stored I would be able to just modify that... or how does DevSound store the rythm speed of the tune? Can you invoque for example <span style="color: #008800">[$89 - SetSpeed]</span> from within the game code?<br /><br />By the way, is it an idea to make 8 different tunes for the 8 maps  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> ? I have no real talent for music so I didn't get past 1 boring old loop...  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br /><br />(edit) By the way, why did you remove the halt in the waitKey routine? Did that cause problems with the music engine? If it is the emulator that hangs (which happened to one of my emulators) than you can use the waitKeyOld routine...
