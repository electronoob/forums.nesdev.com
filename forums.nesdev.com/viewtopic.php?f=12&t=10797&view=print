		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've reached the final stage of the Cx4 dev cart I've been playing around with on and off the last few months, but I've hit a wall right at the end that has me completely stumped.  Reading works fine, but trying to write to the ROM via the cart edge doesn't seem to be working.  First of all, the ROM /CE line is not asserted low for writes to the ROM address space, but I've determined that pin 51 appears to be a /WR output from the Cx4 (it tracks the cart edge /WR signal in all of my tests, including writes to the ROM address space, but I haven't checked it out with an oscilloscope to know any better than that).  So, to handle that, I cut the /CE signal to the ROM, and am decoding it as /WR_OUT AND /CE_OUT (the pin on the Cx4 that it was previously connected to), which maintains read functionality, but still doesn't work for writes.  I hooked up my logic analyzer, and everything looks like it's working.  I've attached screenshots of the logic analyzer output.  I'm limited to 8 channels, so I ran the same operation 3 times so I could display the control lines as well as A[3:0], D[3:0], and D[7:4], respectively.  The only strange behavior is the short high spike on the data lines immediately following the control lines going low, but that shouldn't be a problem, since the only time that the data lines need to be valid is during the *rising* edge of /CE or /WE, whichever comes first (the order doesn't matter).  Timing looks well within spec, I really don't understand what's going on... any ideas?<br /><br /><a href="https://www.micron.com/~/media/documents/products/data%20sheet/nor%20flash/m29fxxft%20fb.pdf" class="postlink">Here's the chip datasheet</a><br /><br />The operation shown in the screenshots is an attempt to execute the erase command (datasheet page 47):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ROMWriteByte(0xAAA, 0xAA);<br />ROMWriteByte(0x555, 0x55);<br />ROMWriteByte(0xAAA, 0x80);<br />ROMWriteByte(0xAAA, 0xAA);<br />ROMWriteByte(0x555, 0x55);<br />ROMWriteByte(0xAAA, 0x10);<br />while(ROMReadByte(0x0000) != 0xFF);</div><br /><br />All of the signals in the logic analyzer screenshots are directly tapped from pins on the ROM, except for /CS_OUT, which is pin 52 on the Cx4.  To my eye, the write cycles look good... not really sure what's going on <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just realized I cropped out the time scale on the original screenshots, my bad.  The datasheet specifies the time period between /CE low and /CE high as 30ns minimum, setup time is 20ns from valid data to /CE high, and hold time after /CE high is 0ns, so even without super high resolution, setup and hold times should not be an issue, seeing as my period from /CE low to /CE high is just shy of 8us, so nearly an order of magnitude slower than the chip maximum specs, and the data lines stabilize ~100ns after /CE low, tons of headroom on the setup time.  Here's a zoomed-in shot of a single write cycle (data value 0xAA).

Especially as you've said that the data is fetched on /CE rising edge. Mind that the real signals won't have perfect square edges (it may take a moment until /CE goes high, and might also take a moment until the ROM chip has realized that it went high - so things will could wrong if you have already disabled the databus at the time when the ROM sees the /CE rising edge).

I most likely did not properly verify &quot;known&quot; pins on the RMX3 (1-ROM) PCB, and only checked for pins that weren't connected on the RMX2 board, like ROM A20.  I need to go back and double-check it, but I actually think the pinout is still correct, the error was in my note about /CE1 being /CE for single ROM boards (instead, for RMX3, the ROM's /OE pin is connected to Gnd, and the Cx4 /OE signal is connected to the ROM /CE pin, and neither /CE signal from the Cx4 is used).<br /><br />Basically, this whole problem occurred because my adapter board follows the pinout of the original MaskROM, and I didn't pay attention to what the PCB was doing to the /OE and /CE pins, and I made the mistake of assuming that the ROM /CE pin was receiving a /CE signal and that the ROM's /OE pin was receiving an /OE signal.  I had a sudden burst of productivity in the last week or so as a result of my term at school finishing up, and I didn't take the time to go back and double-check things that I hadn't looked at in a couple of months.  Once I took a step back and realized what was going on, it was a simple matter of connecting the correct signals to the correct pins.  It is now 100% working, without any decoding logic.  I simply hooked up Cx4 pin 27 to ROM /CE, cut the /OE signal trace on Cx4 pin 52 and connected it to ROM /OE (I had to lift the ROM pin since it was connected to Gnd), and Cx4 pin 51 to ROM /WE, and I'm able to read the full ROM space, erase the ROM, and write it, all from the cart edge.  I've run 3 complete erase/program/read/verify on the full 2MB chip with randomly generated data each time, and it verified each time.  I also programmed an actual MMX3 ROM to it and played through a few levels without any problems.<br /><br />Now that I have my PC&lt;-&gt;cart interface back in working condition, I plan to do some more logic analysis on the Cx4 signals in an attempt to figure out the last few unknown signals (hopefully, one of those is the SRAM /CE signal...), and I'll be updating my pinout accordingly.  Now that I have the dev cart running, I'll probably move on to tracing the unknown signals in the next day or 2.  AFAIK, that pinout is currently published in 4 places, my <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=10291" class="postlink">thread</a> here on nesdev, my <a href="http://board.byuu.org/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;t=4071" class="postlink">thread</a> on byuu's forums (which I'm unable to edit because byuu locks posts from being edited after 24 hours), the <a href="http://wiki.superfamicom.org/snes/show/Capcom+Cx4+-+Hitachi+HG51B169" class="postlink">superfamicom.org wiki</a>, and nocash's documents.  I'll edit my post here and the superfamicom.org wiki.  nocash, you can get the updated info from here for your docs, and I'll ask byuu if he's able and willing to do admin edits to my post on his board.  If the info needs to be edited anywhere else, let me know so I can pass along any updates I come up with.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, so I re-did the continuity tracing on both RMX2 and RMX3, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtmkcXhEAawFdGNOeDRBOW9CSnFDTVI3Y1M1WmxCMmc&amp;usp=sharing" class="postlink">here's what I came up with</a>.  The pin numbers are what I actually traced out on the PCB, the signal names are inferred from the pin numbers.  So, the only error in the original pinout was that /RCE1 and /RCE2 were swapped... so I already knew pin 51 was /OE... that's what I get for not reading my own dang pinout. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  Though, in my defense, it was a fair assumption to believe that the ROM's original /CE pin was, in fact, connected to the /CE signal.  Anyway, it's late and I have work tomorrow, so I'm gonna call it a night.  I'll dig into the last 3 unknown pins tomorrow, though my strong suspicion is that pin 25 is SRAM /CE, and pins 74 and 75 are inputs, and if I'm right, the inputs will be a lot trickier to understand.  Maybe one of them is a Hi/LoROM switch like pin 10 on the MAD-1.  The other, maybe a battery input like pin 7 on the MAD-1?<br /><br />In any case, I'll post any further updates in the original pinout thread, since this one is basically done now.
