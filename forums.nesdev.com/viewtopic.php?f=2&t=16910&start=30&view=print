Too bad SMT ceramic capacitors often don't mark their capacitance. Doing my best to analyze how the spectrum of the square wave's been modified, it looks like it might work out to a lowpass at 3kHz? <br /><br />Both the 2A03 and 163 should be subject to the same corner frequency, because of Th√©venin equivalent circuits.

The others were <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php?title=NES_2.0_submappers&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=5363" class="postlink">sort of floated by lidnariq</a> a long while back, but we had less information, and he seems to have deliberately left them &quot;hidden&quot;. Aside from submapper 1, which Kevtris may have implemented somewhere, the rest are no more than proposals, and most of those very iffy. (I'm not even sure why <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php?title=NES_2.0_submappers/Proposals&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=11477" class="postlink">I unhid them</a>... probably because I thought there was no need to hide stuff that was then relegated to the proposals page.)<br /><br />As far as deprecating a redundancy caused by Kevtris, <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0_submappers#001:_MMC1" class="postlink">this has come up before</a>. Maybe not a big deal to keep this one?<br /><br />I know in the other thread <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=221824#p221824" class="postlink">lidnariq pointed out that Kevtris had made some comments about later changes to the spec</a>, but I might point out that at that point when he said that the &quot;proposals&quot; had not been separated from the actually implementable stuff on the Wiki and it was a <em>huge mess</em>, so I think he was basically very correct in his assessment at that moment. That argument was part of what led to it getting cleaned up and separated like this.<br /><br />The submapper 9 thing is a bit of a unicorn. Someone found it once in one game and I don't think it's been seen again. That same game has also been seen with more &quot;normal&quot; N163 chips in it. Leave it in the proposals, maybe one day some useful information about it will surface.

I just think a handful of deprecated entries is probably a better situation than incompatible forks of the spec.)<br /><br />Is what it specifies really unclear? Doesn't it just mean to battery back the internal mapper RAM? The situation seems very similar to the MMC1 redundancy cases which were left deprecated as well.

I doubt kevtris would be able to explain off-hand why this game and not any of the other Namco games requires this submapper to work correctly on his FPGA console.<br /><br />Totally unrelated, but I measured 21.8Kohms across pins 45 &amp; 46 of my Rolling Thunder cart, the only Namco 163 game I own.  I'd record my original Akumajou Densetsu cartridge using this program but it has to go through my Famicom's the RF modulator first, then the VCR.

The only time that the internal work RAM is not specified is when there is both internal work RAM and 8 KiB of WRAM and both or neither are battery-backed, to prevent the non-power of two size from having to round up. For all these games, such as Megami Tensei 2, it's also possible to denote the 128 byte of work RAM as non-battery-backed (since the games will not use it for save game data but for sound or not at all, which I verified with every single game), and the 8 KiB of WRAM as battery-backed.

No WRAM, battery backed N163.<br /><br />A (battery, 0 unsaved, 0 saved, submapper 1) or B (battery, 0 unsaved, 128b saved, submapper irrelevant) ?<br /><br />I assume this was the case targeted by Kevtris' submapper 1, and A seems consistent with the wiki to me. B is how I'd interpret NewRisingSun's statement.<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=3344" class="postlink">Battle Fleet</a></li><li><a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=1602" class="postlink">Famista '90</a></li><li><a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=1599" class="postlink">Kaijuu Monogatari</a></li><li><a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=3842" class="postlink">Mindseeker</a></li><li><em><a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=3838" class="postlink">Hydlide 3</a></em></li></ul><br />3.

Battery backed WRAM, battery backed N163.<br /><br />A (battery, 0 unsaved, 8k saved, submapper 1?) or B ? (battery, 0 unsaved, 8k saved, submapper irrelevant) ?<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=3839" class="postlink">King of Kings</a>*</li></ul><br /><br />So...<br /><br />A. My wiki interpretation seems to be that the header specified PRG-RAM is only for external RAM on N163, and submapper 1 is used to designate that battery backing also applies to internal N163 RAM. This seems to cover everything except King of Kings. Not sure if King of Kings actually needs the N163 saved, so it might be totally moot, but worst case seems to be that this game needs its own submapper for audio + battery N163. (Adding audio submappers should also imply that submapper 1 is no-audio?) This also seems consistent with <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php?title=NES_2.0&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=14330" class="postlink">the immediately following edit</a> suggesting that flash games should specify battery save, but 0 PRG-RAM.<br /><br />B. NewRisingSun instead appears to want to specify that 128b in the RAM fields as often as possible. King of Kings becomes a special case again, but this time because the 128b bytes as &quot;unlisted&quot; is being used to imply that it should be saved? Have I got this correct?<br /><br />Thankfully, except for King of Kings the games using audio expansion don't seem to fall on the stickier cases.
