If only all carts were this easy <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />
<br />
<br />The question i wanted to ask was for 16mbit games can i split and stack 2 eproms on the board or do i need an encoder?
<br />
<br />And while im on the topic of type 00 carts, i want to also make myself a Bs zelda. It says under snes9x that it is high rom with 256kb ram + bat BUT ive seen pics of one on the net done on the small type 00 with out any ram or even a battery. Was the pic wrong or was it Snes9x ?

However if the board has 2 rom sockets then the decoding for that is already there for those two chip sizes. 
<br />
<br />BS-Zelda is a very buggy game. Making a cartridge of it is somewhat silly. No version exists that is free of bugs. Many don't even run outside of older emulators like ZSNES and SNES9X. I will tell you that it is HiROM, no mistake there. I'm not sure if it will run without RAM on cartridge but I think it will. But depending on the version it may be required.

<br />
<br />Uh, I am that guy. 
<br />
<br />There are two versions of my "real hardware" patch. Actually probably three. One without a Title Screen intro, one with, one with as well as unfinished save support. All are playable beginning to end on real hardware with a minor bug or two, and no actual "ending" screen.

<br />I remember talking to someone a few years ago about the possibility of putting BS-Zelda on a cartridge. The version I sent him apparently had a heap of bugs in the title screen which was added - is this still true with these new ere patches or is it actually able to be put on a cartridge and played through apart from the few minor bugs?

I even tried it on a hi rom cart with 256k ram and no good <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />As for my original question im guessing its probably easiest to just borrow a mad-1 from another cart and use that hey?
<br />
<br />And just one more question while were on the topic of decoders, what do i use for a 3Mbit game using 3 1Mbit eproms? I know i could just expand the rom onto 4 eproms and do it that way but it seems like a waste.

<br />
<br />Yes it's true that somewhere in Roto's code there are bugs that prevent the game from functioning on real hardware and every big version of BSZ is based apon it besides mine.
<br />
<br />For a 3mbit game, use a 4mbit eprom. It's not a waste and it simplifies wiring. Just copy the first 1mbit to appear at the last 4mbit and the game will have no idea it's on a chip larger than normal.

<br />Some good news. I got Bs zelda working, bad news was that it was on one of my very limited Hi rom 64k + bat carts. I want to save that for something else and have a sh*t tonne of type 00 lorom carts SO, can and how would i convert those to hi rom?
<br />
<br />Id still also like to make some 3mb carts and would love to know which encoder i need  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

For a 3 MegaByte ROM you will probably needed a decoder and three 27C801 EPROMs. And I suppose properly you'd enable the first ROM also as a "4th" ROM to properly mirror but I doubt any game would rely on this but it's possible.

<br />
<br />Yeah, my bad i meant 3mb or 24mbit. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />  So your saying if i connect the first eprom to line one and 4 on the encoder it should work? Awesome. I though i was going to have to expand it to 4mb or 32mbits and put it across 4 27c801's.
<br />
<br />As for lo to hi rom conversion is it doable? i cant imagine it being that hard. Especially on a type 00 cart.

<br />ATM it involves soldering to the cart connector pins which isn't good as it eventualy warps the pins in the snes cart slot, so i will change that in the next one i do by soldering to the proper pads instead.
