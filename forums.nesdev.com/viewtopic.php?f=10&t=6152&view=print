The very first thing you need to do is implement the PPU's registers ($2000 - $2007). You will need to keep track of the CPU and PPU to figure out when certain important events happen which early on the main one is $2002 will need to know when VBlank occurs. This will also be in relation to when to trigger NMI interrupts. Based on register $2000 the game can choose if NMI interrupts occur on VBLANK, which happens after the last scanline is rendered. 
<br />
<br />You'll probably write and rewrite your graphics emulation code in the future so for now if you just want quick results here is a basic idea. Have a counter that counts the amount of CPU cycles executed. Each time a CPU opcode is executed you add the cycle time to this counter. When the counter exceeds 27280 (thats 113.6 the amount of cpu cycles per scanline for NTSC) you've had 240 scanlines drawn. You should mark a flag for this loop related to a check that checks after each opcode if 240 lines have passed by. If the flag isn't set, then you set it and set the VBLANK flag in $2002 as well as check $2000 if you need to trigger a NMI interrupt. Then when 262 lines have passed by, you reset that flag, and subtract 29780 from the counter which is approx 262 scanlines. This will have you setup on a loop to trigger VBLANK flags, NMIs, and games will execute more of their program code than before. 
<br />
<br />Then you could add some video emulation just by drawing the NameTable to the screen at the same time you are setting the VBL flag and checking to see if you need to trigger a NMI. After drawing the NameTable to the screen you could add drawing the sprites, add drawing the nametables with scrolling in effect. 
<br />
<br />Now if you have a specific sticking point on what you don't understand I'm sure you can get an answer.

<br />
<br />There is no algorithm or magic piece of code that does it. I can explain how graphics rendering works on NES but there are enough documents on it already. Again, if you have a specific question, we can help. But it's not possible to just post graphics code you can snap into your emulator. If you want to see complete NES graphics emulation code you could download the source to many open source NES emulators. But I don't think that will help you much. It's better to understand it and write your own code than to try to plug in someone else's code.

<br />ok, i think this algorithm you wrote may be helpful.
<br />
<br />let's start with step 1: fetch a name table entry.
<br />
<br />first of all, i have to read wich is written in $2000 to fetch the information about the address of the name table wich is gonna be used (bits 0 and 1) and the sprite pattern table and background pattern table wich are gonna be used (bits 3 and 4, respectively). that's easy. but what do you mean with "name table entry"? is it a write to $2004 or $2006 or any write to an address between the name table space?
<br />also i have another question about this. as i read, $2003 is used to write the 8-bit address in SPR-RAM to access via $2004. i.e.:
<br />
<br />(extracted from GbaGuy demo)
<br />
<br />	lda #$00   ; these lines tell $2003
<br />	sta $2003  ; to tell
<br />	lda #$00   ; $2004 to start
<br />	sta $2003  ; at $0000.
<br />
<br />when i'm handling a routine like that, do i have to store the first write to $2003 (the first "sta $2003") in some variable in order to later assemble it with the value written in the second write? because if i don't, at the second write i'll miss the value written in first time. in that case, why its says it's a 8-bit address if it's a 16-bits address (2 bytes written to $2003 = 16-bits address)?
<br />does all the addresses in a name table work like this? (i.e.: $2014 -&gt; the address register, $2015 -&gt; I/O register)

<br />The first write to $2003 is IGNORED because it's only an 8-bit register. It DOES NOT use the latch that $2005 and $2006 use.

<br />look at this simply code:

<br />now the question is: how do i fetch the corresponding pattern table entry?

<br />thanks for your answer tepples, but what that "Y" stands for?
<br />i'm assuming that "Reg2000_PatternTableBase" holds the value of the bit of Register 2000 wich indicates the pattern table address (sprite or background). is that right?
