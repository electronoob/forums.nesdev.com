		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When I reset the ROM in FCEU, the title screen jumps downward by several dozen scanlines* for about one or two frames.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img530.imageshack.us/img530/8511/titlescreenjumpbr3.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />The image on the left shows how the title screen usually looks. The image on the right shows what happens for the first frame or so after resetting the ROM. Note that the metallic highlights (which are sprites) are not affected.
<br />
<br />As a workaround, on reset I blank the screen by setting every palette entry to the background color, then wait for a few frames before switching to the real palette.
<br />
<br />The workaround is effective, and it seems like many commercial NES games do the same thing; however, I was wondering if somebody could give a technical explanation of why the jump might be occurring. If there's a proper way to prevent it, that's what I'd prefer to do, since clearing the palette feels like a kludge.
<br />
<br />* In case it helps, the image above shows a jump of exactly 57 scanlines.

<br />What Celius suggested will probably fix it. Wait for VBlank before enabling rendering.
<br />
<br />In fact this is the exact same problem we were started discussing <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=39355#39355" class="postlink">here</a>. I suggested a pretty clen fix at the end of <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=39361#39361" class="postlink">this</a> post.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From what I've worked on recently, it seems to me that Nestopia has been becoming the most accurate, but I have to always set it to Above Normal priority just to make it run well on my system :/  So, I usually use Nintendulator for most of my preliminary tests. I also use FCEUXD SP when I need to use a hex viewer while it runs. After I've got it how I want it to run on Nintendulator, I usually test against Nestopia after that, since I tire of setting the priority everytime I boot it up.

<br />With all of the branches that it's had, you'd think someone would come along to try making one that improves the accuracy, while keeping all of the debugging features.

<br />
<br />I see your point, but mostly for basic debugging is what I meant, not for really hardware specific things. Nintendulator would be the next best option to debug with, but it's ease of use doesn't compare to FCEUXD's. And if you're going to try debug with Nestopia, you might as well try and debug on an actual NES; it has about just as much debugging capabilities.
<br />
<br />On a side note, I don't meant to sound like a dick when I say this, but you really don't have to use ";)" with every post. It starts to lose it's meaning after a while.

It also seems to have a very obscure input bug that will sometimes cause a button to stick for several frames. IIRC, I found only one mention of it on the forums, and it was pretty much shrugged off... -_-

<br />
<br />For debugging, nothing beats FCEUXD. Nintendlator's debugger is very unfriendly, and those hardcoded levels of debugging are a pain... Why can't you pick the individual windows you need like in FCEUXD? So I usually end up using Nintendulator only for testing, because it's accuracy used to be legendary (but I don't even know if this is the case anymore, as Nestopia is getting pretty damn accurate too).
<br />
<br />When developing, I always keep these 3 emulators open. I use Nestopia the most though, with every build of the game. I use the others occasionally, and to track down bugs.

<br />Same here. Nestopia was slow on my PC 3 years ago before I switched, tough.
<br />
<br />And like tokumary said I also use mostly Nestopia and also Virtua NES. Virtua NES isn't very accurate but it's damn fast and you can get a lot of features using only one keyboad key without having to deal with menus and all, that's why I love that emulator to debug things as quickly as possible.
