		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've tried loading unlaunch.dsi as bootthis.dsi a few more times. It doesn't completely hang for me. But there's something murky: Sometimes loading takes about 2-4 seconds longer than it should, and the installer is then randomly complaining about camera ID's being all FFh's, or the console being running in NDS mode, and/or the power-button-auto-reset not being working.<br /><br />The problem seems to occur mostly when trying to install a different version than already installed (even if there are only a few bytes of code changed, but it works as soon as those same changes are applied to both the installer &amp; already installed version). So it looks as if the loaded data is ignored, or as if cache isn't updated - ending up with newly loaded code mixed with old code in memory.<br /><br />I haven't yet figured out what is wrong there. But unlaunch v1.2 seems to be quite unstable.<br />I've added a &quot;don't use!&quot; warning for that version on the webpage.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Apache Thunder wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">As for my DS-X. I did post the rom image for it in a previous reply. You must have missed it.</div><br />Ah, the &quot;_SD_TF_NDS_ASMA00.zip&quot; file. Yup, I tried that... in no$gba it says something like &quot;Loading...&quot;<br />I guess that means that it tries to load data from the flashcart's (unemulated) internal sd-card storage.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">edo9300 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Yeah, i too was suspecting it was an hardware issue, now i'm asking myself if it's because of damaged components or some different chips of the ds. As for the firmware, i didn't do nothing of those things, i only installed unlaunch via flipnote and that's all, i didn't modify my nand in other ways. I could send pics of my console if needed</div><br />At the moment I suspect that I've screwed up something - so better wait before you try to desolder/repair your chips, they are probably all fine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ugh, I think I've tracked down the unstable part: nds/dsi titles are started with cache disabled, and unlaunch is also doing that before starting other titles - the problem is that the disabled cache does still seem to hold old data even when in disabled state, and that old data will 'mysteriously' reappear once when the loaded title (re-)enables the cache. Instead of just disabling the cache, correct way to disable+kill the cache content should be:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">- clean data cache (writeback any write-buffered data from cache to actual memory)<br />- disable cache (while doing this, a few more bytes might get newly loaded into code+data caches)<br />- invalidate data+code caches (forget all cached data+code)<br /></div><br />Without that, any kind of weird and not-so-funny effects can happen. One of the weirdest was arm9 hanging for about 10 minutes in a small memfill function (and then resuming normal execution after that 10 minutes). And the nastiest effects were those cases where everything seemed to work fine (making me think to have solved the issue a bunch of times - only to see the problem to reappear after making a few more unrelated code changes).<br /><br />So, well, I hope I've now really fixed it. Will do a few more tests, and (if it keeps working), upload next version soon.

I thought it would ignore the incoming list and instead create a device list on its own.<br />If v1.3 is working stable, then plans for next version would be adding some bootmenu to select different titles, without manually needing to rename titles to bootthis.dsi and then storing them on SD card (or SD-card image) in order to test them. That will make it easier to test/fix issues with launcher (or other titles).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Robz8 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I believe all homebrew have this issue, including HiyaCFW (settings menu), DSiMenu++, and nesDS, which we're tested.</div><br />Hmmm, that seem to be all available only from those open source sites that are available only via https. I could try downloading them on another PC and then transfer them to my own computer... or is the power-button problem already fixed in v1.3?

I didn't knew that program. I thought Opera 10.53 was the newest browser working on win9x, but that's about 8-10 years old. Hmmm, downloading RetroZilla without https seems to be impossible ; ) okay, downloaded it on a laptop, and moved the installer to my PC...<br />It can access https gbatemp, but with the gbatemp java script adverts, it's endless slow, and the browser seems to have no option for disabling java script for certain webpages (it can only disable it for <em>all</em> webpages).<br />As for other https sites: Sourceforge bugs saying that the webpage is empty. And github uses a &quot;not enabled&quot; https security protocol (I am using the latest RetroZilla version from 2017, which is itself being hosted on github - meaning that RetroZilla is unable to browse to its own homepage).<br />RetroZilla doesn't seem to be of too much use at the moment : / but thanks for mentioning it! Maybe it'll be useful for some other webpage someday (or maybe it gets updated and works better in next version).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">edo9300 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Weirdly enough...
