		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am interested in returning to reverse engineering the CIC chips.  The fact that we know the Tengen algorithm, and have a working replacement for the other regions, is great ... but it is frustrating to me that we never figured out the CPU opcodes of the actual CIC.  In particular, doing so should give us the SNES CIC (which appears to use the same CPU) and possibly even the N64 security chips (I haven't verified this myself).
<br />
<br />We have the nintendo CIC roms ... so it seems like we already have a "Rosetta stone" and just need some keen thinking to figure it out.
<br />
<br />I wanted to decap and read out a 3193 chip (CIC for USA region), so I could compare it to the later chip ROM we already have as well as the 3195 rom we already have.  I figure this will give us the interleaving part ... and hopefully Tengen was quite ernest in their copying, and we can match up the rom with the tengen algorithm to figure out the opcodes.
<br />
<br />
<br />Bleh, I began babbling again.
<br />My question is this:  
<br />What cartridge can I buy which will have a 3193A cic chip?
<br />
<br />The only 3193A chip I had I got from a Golf cart (due to this list <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NES_games" class="postlink">here</a> which shows it as an older game, and because it is not a popular game so it is cheap).  I got some of the ROM off it, but I accidentally cracked it and I need to start over. Since then I've ordered two more Golf carts.  One was a 6113A, and the other was a 6113B1.
<br />
<br />Seriously, what the heck?  That game was issued enough times that it has all three generations of the USA CIC chip?
<br />
<br />Any cart suggestions people? (Or would anyone be willing to donate a couple 3193A chips?)  A couple more tries and I'm pretty sure I can get the last of that data.

<br />The rom addressing of the nes and snes cics that were decapped (and had 64x64 rom arrays) may be done using an LFSR, as that takes less die space than a linear program counter.
<br />
<br />Did you ever get high-res pictures of the address and data lines for the cic rom? That may be able to shed some light on the per-word addressing and bit order.

<br />The problem is that you can't really tell what the circuitry is from the pictures (unless I can somehow pull off that feat with the Tengen chip again where I just remove a couple layers and take more pictures).  In the microscope however (maybe because of the stereo-vision) you can see more than the pictures and usually can figure out the circuitry.  I stared at it for quite awhile once, and the row and bit line decoders acted quite reasonably.  However trying to follow where these lines came from got really hairy.  The address lines seemed to go back to something with a series of logic cells which did have feedback into each other ... I thought they may be a counter, but there appeared to be other strange stuff going on as well ... I had trouble following all of it, and was never really convinced of what I was looking at.

<br />I hope you can pull it off again, if you're doing more decapping.  Those were invaluable for figuring out the Tengen chip logic.

<br />As you know I have my own interests in mind making flash cartridges for the SNES, so this is what I was planning on doing:
<br />
<br />1) Get die photos from a company
<br />2) Write CAD type program to  reverse engineer circuit
<br />3) Simulate circuit to reverse engineer the functionality
<br />4) Write AVR clone.
<br />
<br />My understanding is that most ICs are all made using a set of standard cells or gates that can be easily identified. You can then trace their connections and create a verilog model

I felt very uncomfortable with what they were claiming and collecting donations ... I tried to ask several straight-foreward questions and was only told probing was included if necessary and basically "trust me".<br /><br />Because I have never figured out how to stain NAND ion implant ROM, I have contacted companies about using their services.  A couple were willing to do decapping and imaging for about or less than $1k or even down to ~ $200.  Please understand though how painfully simple this is for them.  That is a lot of money (I understand though that they need to make money, just keep in mind here) for the effort extended.  To get anything more, care actually has to be taken.  Removing just some oxide but not that last 100 nm or whatever ... or doing special reactions to stain but not destroy a sample ... etc.  Quickly you are now talking on the _order_ of $10k, and with rom read-out two sources estimated $50k-$70k.<br /><br /><br />With the equipment they have, it isn't too difficult, but you'd need to find an insider willing to use company equipment on their own time for basically moonlighting.  If this is the case, costs could come crashing down and be worthwhile.  And I'd understand they want to "protect their source", but they can tell us this without revealing their source.  If instead all they will get is decapping + images ... and hoping for those rare cases where you can read the ROM directly without post-processing (if the rom is encoded in the metal connect layer) ... I feel they are misleading the public in asking donations.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">cybertron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Also the photos will be high quality, so I won't go blind.

<br />When do you plan on doing this?
<br />If you are doing your step #1 soon, then I guess I don't really need to try doing it (especially since professional photos will look much nicer).
<br />
<br />As for the rest there, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I think you are being a bit naive.  In CMOS there are "only" n-FET and p-FET transistors, but if you look at an IC you don't see many repeats of two types of images.  Take a look at the pictures we have from the Tengen chip to get a better idea of what is realistic here.

<br />
<br />If I had to use fuming nitric acid, I would charge a lot! How do you dissolve the oxide layer to get to the polysilicon? Maybe HF <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />
<br />
<br />My understanding is the Tengen chip has a fixed number of cells, like a NAND gate, XOR, a register, etc. Even if this is not true for the real CIC, my idea was to create a program that lets you identify such cells and give them a function, then create a netlist by how they are joined together. And a slider so you can go between layers. I still am oversimplifying things a bit tho <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />So if we get high quality shots of the 2 layers, we are set! You have already read the ROM contents right? So its doesn't need any staining. As a bonus you get the circuit for the NES CIC as well.
<br />
<br />This is currently one of those crazy ideas I keep thinking about but take me forever to do. I should get a quote soon tho, it still sounds like it might be too expensive

<br />So just ignoring the staining, you'd still need:
<br />1) decap 
<br />2) photograph 
<br />3) delayer to polysilicon 
<br />4) photograph 
<br />
<br />I'd estimate around $5k-$10k.  If they consider delayering as easy as decapping, you may get lucky and it is much cheaper.
<br />
<br />Hopefully I'm wrong with the price.  Let us know, for if it turns out to be too expensive for you, then I'll give the delayering a try myself.  I haven't figured out how to get this replacement camera for the microscope working with the computer yet though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can't get the camera to work on the microscope at the moment. However I have some good news, the 6113A is readible enough that I think it is possible to read the circuitry without any delayering.   For photos with a microscope to be readable, I will probably also need to get a picture of the bare silicon (hardest to read layer currently) which is easy.
<br />
<br />I also have a friend here helping with looking at the circuitry.
<br />
<br />Anyway, things we've noticed so far:
<br />-strangely enough, the ROM doesn't seem to be addressed "normally".  Somehow each quadrant of the rom (upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right as seen in the stained rom picture), is treated slightly differently.  I haven't figured out the details yet.
<br />
<br />-I haven't figured out the details of the program counter yet, but know where it is.  My friend found a path that allows it to update with data from the ROM.  I haven't double checked this yet, but if correct all 8 rom bits are used ... which means the instructions can be (or always are) multi-word.
<br />
<br />- next to the program counter is a structure for latching/storing it.  This appears to be 40 flip-flops, arranged as 4x10bit.  Maybe this is a hardware stack.  Why would they need something like that for a project so simple though?  The Tengen didn't use anything like that.
<br />
<br />
<br />I wish I could share pictures.  My current plan is to figure out the program counter (so we know how the rom is arranged), and then figure out the jump command (see what causes the program counter to be updated with rom).  If indeed the cpu core was used elsewhere, this should help us quickly test that idea.  Also, once the rom arrangement is known, we can hopefully "rosetta stone" the rest using the Tengen code.
<br />
<br />Any thoughts/comments?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It is very hard to read this damn thing, as it frequently doesn't use complementary logic.  I've finally resigned myself to the fact that the stack, when being read out, if left in that state too long will become undefined.  Even worse is the "program counter" which is literally missing all of the complementary logic (its as if it is NMOS, but missing the pull up resistor ... it needs to  be frequently reset (once per cycle) to work correctly ... and depends on the inherent capacitance in the system as well).
<br />
<br />Another thing confusing me is the diffusion layers don't make sense to me from a processing stand-point.  My current theory is that they are using n-type bulk, which I have not seen before.  It isn't affecting the read out of the circuitry, but still makes me curious how some of the seemingly strange power connections all work (I'm sure I could figure it out eventually, it is just a limitation that I only see the surface and cannot identify with certainty how the dopant layers are done vertically).

<br />Also, I was trying to follow the reset pin.  Is the chip reset when that pin is high or low?
<br />
<br />To follow the smk idea, do have a more detailed document that explains the instruction cycles and such (or at the very least gives instruction cycle counts for the opcodes)?
<br />
<br />While it was probably mentioned years ago when we first looked at this, the 6113A says "CK1GL" on the silicon.  It doesn't mean anything to me, but maybe it does to you?

I've finally resigned myself to the fact that the stack, when being read out, if left in that state too long will become undefined.  Even worse is the "program counter" which is literally missing all of the complementary logic (its as if it is NMOS, but missing the pull up resistor ... it needs to  be frequently reset (once per cycle) to work correctly ... and depends on the inherent capacitance in the system as well).<br /><br />Another thing confusing me is the diffusion layers don't make sense to me from a processing stand-point.  My current theory is that they are using n-type bulk, which I have not seen before.  It isn't affecting the read out of the circuitry, but still makes me curious how some of the seemingly strange power connections all work (I'm sure I could figure it out eventually, it is just a limitation that I only see the surface and cannot identify with certainty how the dopant layers are done vertically).<br /><br /><br />Also, I was trying to follow the reset pin.

<br />That's correct.  I noticed during my CIC RE that if you left the thing unclocked for long enough, it would crash and required a reset.  The chip is reset when reset is HIGH.  Reset connects to 5V thru a capacitor, so it will be pulled high on reset, then I assume the chip has a pulldown on it, which causes the cap to charge and then it sees a low during operation.
<br />
<br />Also another thing, the CIC processor is used on the ROB too... I'm 99.99999% sure of this.  It has an identical pinout with respect to reset, power, and clock.  It also uses both clock pins with a ceramic resonator.  The CIC has the two clock pins but they just drive Xin instead of using a resonator or crystal.    Obviously, code is different.
<br />
<br />Also, this CPU is used in the coin timer on the famicombox and has a part number of 3199.   I obviously am not going to send that for decapping since I only have one, and unfortunately I don't have a ROB any more to heist the chip from.
<br />
<br />I checked my FDS with the "protection CPU" and it seems to be 20 pins or so instead of 16 (from what I recall) so it most likely isn't the same CPU.
