<br />Because some published NES games depend on quirks that the pocket famiclones don't implement correctly. Do the MMC2, MMC4, and MMC5 games run properly? What about <em>Bee 52</em> and <em>Micro Machines</em>? If you're not concerned about accuracy, then get a used GBA SP, a GBA Movie Player, a cheap CF card, and the PocketNES emulator.

<br />No, the port into the SNES is alot bigger than the one into the NES. Plus the SNES plug has an extra pin type thing in the center. I just wish the SNES and the NES had a more convinient figure, like I wish the NES was a little flatter that it is. I think the expansion port makes like an extra inch or so, and it's completely useless. Do any of you keep that damn metal dust shield on the bottom of the NES's motherboard? I threw it in the trash, because when I took my NES apart, I had to remove the dust shield to get to the motherboard, and I could NOT put it back on.

<br />Still sounds much harder (and expensive) than just buying a Pokefami. I honestly haven't tried those games you mentioned, 'cause I don't have any of them. If I ever have the chance I'll try.

<br />Something curious happened today... I was at the place I usually buy my NES games and those exact 2 carts were there. Bought them for 10 bucks (US$) each.
<br />
<br />I havent tested them on any of my famiclones yet, but I can tell they don't work on my NES. Well, I can only see the "Code Masters" logo forming in the middle of the screen, an then the system resets and shows that again, over and over and over. Puting the cart's switch in another position didn't work.
<br />
<br />Both games worked perfectly on the famiclone at the place I bought them, I didn't see any gliches. I have one of the same brand at home, it's not the same model, though. I'm guessing they will work fine, as the problem seems to be lockout chip-related.

<br />Maybe not the american NES and SNES, but for me, my european NES and SNES have the exact same video port and power adaptator. I use the same, and I just plug in and out the jacks when I alternate between playing my NES and my SNES.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was thinking that. The American NES RFU and the SNES RFU are the same, but not for AV. I really wish that the power was the same as well. I actually bought an SNES/Genisis/NES adapter, and it had to cords on it, one for the NES, and one for the SNES. It would have been a handy, space-saving device, but I cut the cord off of the NES part, and used it for the 9V battery idea.

<br />
<br />Just remove it and throw it away.  That's what I do <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />   I hate those damn shields.  They don't do anything really other than increase the weight of the system, and keep the FCC happy.

<br />
<br />Super Mario Brothers 3 runs nicely off battery and so do all my other games, no idea why that mario runs slow on all my NES's :\
<br />
<br />Btw, will the battery have more power sucked from it if it runs through the power circuit rather than just hooking it up to the 7805?
