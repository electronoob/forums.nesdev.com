		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Now I know that some SNES games were released in different versions over time (1.0/1.1/1.2) but what about NES/PlayStation games?
<br />
<br />I'm asking because I've dug out my old PSX CD's and started to play them, and the thought just came to me, (am I playing the most recent version of FF7? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />). I thought about checking the CD's in my PC against a checksum on the web but I can't seem to find any. Does anyone know of a site I could check?
<br />
<br />With NES games, I'd imagine RPG's needing a re-release more than some simple shooter. It could have been a nice 'byte' inside of the iNES header <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />.
<br />
<br />Did companies release their products only to abandon them straight away and move on to other games? If this is the case, then I doubt very much all that would be different are spelling and grammar etc.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />About the Playstation, a friend and I were playing one of the FF games (FF9 maybe), the only one I'd ever tried after the SNES ones though.  But something happened to where one of the disks got lost or broken.  So he bought the game again (used).  But then it wouldn't load the save, it said it was the wrong version!  Seriously, why would they change the save data format?  What a rip-off experience, after playing most of the way through the game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I heard somewhere that they actually fixed the Aeris/Aerith confusion for the english release of FF7 later on. When I played it when it first came out, there was a character named "Aeris" (for those of you who don't care about/haven't played FF7). However, in other countries and later games/movies with her character, she was referred to as "Aerith". I, personally, find "Aeris" to be a much cooler name, so I always refer to her as "Aeris". 
<br />
<br />But this glitch makes sense, I suppose. In the Japanese version, her name was "Earisu", which is as close as you can get to spelling "Aerith" in Japanese. Turning names into English from Japanese is always tricky unless they're familiar names. Because in "Earisu", we're not sure of a couple things: a. is the "u" supposed to be part of the name (in Japanese, when writing names and foreign words that end in a consonant other than "n", it must be followed by a "u"), b. is the "r" a substitute for an "l", c. is the "s" an "s" or a "th". So for all we know, that name could really be "Ealithu" or something like that. Actually, now that I think of it, if it were supposed to end with an "oo" sound, there'd be two u's at the end. Anyways, I'm sure that's where there was confusion in the translation department. But I heard they fixed the English release to say "Aerith" now.

<br />Well I wouldn't reject the name "Aerith" because if you see all the effort square has made in naming her "Aerith" in everything else, you can tell that's what it's meant to be. Unfortunately, it's not as cool as their mistake, "Aeris". Actually, I'm pretty sure "Aerith" sounds stupid. Maybe I wouldn't think so if I didn't previously know her as "Aeris". Anyways, I suppose that's not what this thread is about!
