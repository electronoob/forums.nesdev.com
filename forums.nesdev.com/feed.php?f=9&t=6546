If you'd rather use windows, you could look into "arcade frontends" or something similar (more often used for the MAME emulator, but most of them support other emulators).<br /><br />It took a little bit of tweaking stuff (and edits in the registry as well), but I installed TinyXP and a front-end called MALA on my old PC that I put into an arcade cabinet.  It boots very fast, looks great in the menu (using a skin someone made, I forget what it's called), and other than the BIOS screen at power-up (which I guess could be hide-able too on most mainboards) you can't even tell it's in windows PC unless you exit the front-end program.  And it's all controllable with a joystick and a few buttons.  Usually the only problem is the (highly annoying) requirement of having to press alt+F4 to exit most windows programs.  So you need a way to map a button (or combination of buttons) to that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Jun 30, 2010 9:52 am</p><hr />

Plus I would need to come up with a way to make loading the emulator and games easy.  I could just have the emulator boot on startup, but the emulators I have used have had a somewhat clunky interface, but that was all a while ago and I didn't really get into it to much, so there may be better ones out there.  Also since I will be entering car shows I want to keep things as legal as possible, and I don't know if the software falls under abandonware or what.  I'm sure I won't have any issues so this isn't a big concern to me really. The nice thing with a tiny PC is that it is probably the easiest to integrate into the car, no need to cut slots for cartridges, just a power button and some USB ports for the interface.<br /><br />Definately need to think about it some more, but I just want to explore my options.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4440">cd36</a> — Wed Jun 30, 2010 6:16 am</p><hr />

The NES connector is metric, it's 2.5mm.  The pins will get shorted in a .1" (2.54mm) connector.  A game genie sounds like the way to go.  Another source of connectors would be a cheap clone that takes NES carts.<br /><br />The Famicom connector, however is .1" pitch (2.54mm).<br /><br />As for wireless, there was a company called Messiah a while back, that had released some wireless controllers.  The receiver shouldn't need power (the NES controller port supplies +5V).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Jun 29, 2010 8:41 pm</p><hr />

So I'm not sure if this is the correct forum to be posting this in, but in a few of my Google searches this forum would come up, so I figured I would register and at least throw my question out there.<br /><br />I have a 2006 Chrysler 300C, it has a rear seat DVD player with RCA inputs, and I am converting it to the newer MyGig head unit (Built in HDD with Nav, Touchscreen, plus can control 2 video sources and one video out).<br /><br />Now since I have 2 RCA in's when I convert to the MyGig system, I'm thinking one will be used for an NES thats been integrated into my car.<br /><br />I haven't done much digging around yet, but I'll find an empty place where I can mount the mainboard, then I would remotely mount the 72 pin edge card loader, controller ports, and power/reset buttons.  I can't remember what voltage the NES"s PSU converts to, but I'm sure I can either use straight 12VDC or find a way to make it work.  Worst case I wire in a power inverter and use the NES"s PSU to do the conversion. Not to concerned.<br /><br />The part I can see myself having trouble with is mounting the 72 pin edge card connector remotely from the board.  I started looking around digikey, and with my little knowledge on edge cards could get something close, but I don't know if it will work.  I ended up as far as:<br /><br />Card Type: Duel Edge(?)<br />Gender: Female<br />Number of positions: 72<br />Pitch: 2.54 (seen it listed as straight 2.5 though, so this may be an issue)<br />Number of rows: 2 (assuming that either side of the edge card is counted as a row)<br /><br />And thats about it.  Has anyone successfully ordered something similar off of digikey?  Do you have the exact part that works, or is it all proprietary spacing that doesn't quite fit anything standard?  And this is only taking into account the cartridge side, I still need to get specs on the mainboard side of the edgecard, so I'm not sure if what I am trying to do is possible.<br /><br />I have seen recommendations as well to use a game genie, and take out the board and just put in wire's to extend the connection, this is probably my easiest chance of making it work, as I can just leave the U connector on the NES, then use the Game Genie to extend to where I want to load the games to.<br /><br />Also, I have seen mention some places of wireless NES controllers, I don't know if they mean they are modified to work on the Wii or if there is actually wireless controllers for the NES (assuming the receivers would probably need external power).  So do such a thing exist?  I see mention of it, but nowhere actually sells them that I can find.  The less plugs I have to cut into my car the better, I want to maintain a fairly stock look.<br /><br />Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4440">cd36</a> — Tue Jun 29, 2010 7:41 pm</p><hr />
