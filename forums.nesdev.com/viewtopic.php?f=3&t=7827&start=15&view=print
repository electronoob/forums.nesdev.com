<br />
<br />Maybe it is related to the Power-Up state of your emulator? Try randomizing WRAM on power-up (not reset) rather than possibly zeroing all of RAM. Maybe be mindful of initial register states? Just some ideas.

<br />"Super Mario Bros" stores some of it's titlescreen data in CHRROM so if your PPU-reading code is broken, this is a good title to verify that. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Most rows "Ok". Palette readback is "DPjr", but once I managed to get it to say "Error".

<br />All Ok

<br />On the controller test screens, player 2's controller doesn't respond.
<br />On the second, only up, down, left, and right work, not Se, St, B, or A.
<br />I haven't tried it with a Four Score because I don't own one.
<br />
<br />On the menus, sometimes pressing and holding select results in glitching, as if the TV momentarily loses sync.
<br />
<br />But I'd take this result with a grain of salt. The controller test screen somehow causes writes back to the PowerPak's CHR RAM, even though this tester is supposed to be using CHR ROM (that is, write-protecting CHR RAM).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have some comments and questions about the NEStress test rom. First, I have been trying it on many emulators... three of which I'm going to talk about here: Nestopia, Nintendulator, and FCEUX. Nestopia and Nintendulator performed almost exactly the same as tepples described. I enabled four-score in Nestopia and two-players in Nintendulator, they both only read from player 1. FCEUX had differences in the PPU and Controller Tests. In, the PPU, it gave Error for PPU Palette Write/Read and Ok for Sprite Collision and Sprite Limiter. For controllers with four-score enabled, it read ports 1 and 3 (which are both $4016) but not 2 and 4.
<br />
<br />Now I have some questions. First, what's with all the 4's? If you don't know what I'm talking about, run the Controller Test in one of the 3 emulators I mentioned. For the $4016 reads, you should get 4040404040404040. However, some other emulators (such as Nestreme) display all zeroes. The 0s are what change when you press the corresponding button. Also, why is this a 16-digit number instead of 8, corresponding to the 8 bits? Is it hexadecimal?
<br />
<br />The next thing I have to ask isn't specific to the NEStress ROM, but the Controller Test really makes it noticeable: Signature Bits. I have found very little information about this in the documentation on this site and wondered if anyone knew how these bits change for all the different peripherals.
<br />
<br />And some questions for tepples: What model of the NES did you run NEStress.nes on? And how did you manage to get the Palette readback to say Error?

The reason it reads as 40 instead of 00 is because the upper 2 bits of the controller registers return open bus which in this case happens to have 40 on it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">6T4 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The next thing I have to ask isn't specific to the NEStress ROM, but the Controller Test really makes it noticeable: Signature Bits.

<br />The only input device I know of where signature bits are a factor is the Four Score and the details of the bits are covered on the wiki page here <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Four_Score">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Four_Score</a><!-- m --> other input devices tend to just repeat a meaningless value over and over after the first 8 reads.

<br />* Pro Wrestling (locks when pressing start)
<br />* Rush'n Attack (locks up when pressing start)
<br />* Jackal (blank screen)
<br />
<br />I've done logs that traces the code but there's lots and lots of code executed (not just a cmp/bne loop that I was hoping for <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />) which makes it difficult to trace.
<br />My CPU core pass' the Nesstress-test, and I pass blaargs vbl_nmi_timing/framebasics-test aswell.
<br />
<br />Anyone notices anything special about these games? Konami? Mapper 2? Anything else?

<br />
<br />Is there absolutely *no* looping detectible in the log?  Perhaps you could post the tail 100 entries or so, or PM me more than that?  Then one of us could set up a breakpoint in our emulators at or around the address you're at and have at least a ballpark idea of where to start looking.  Even with that, it still might be a needle in a haystack, but the haystack right now is the size of the universe.  Narrow it down a bit, please!

<br />Ur...why?  Do you mean: "I log a single line if I detect such looping so as not to pollute my log." or "I don't log any lda $2002, bpl sequences or even an indication that it occurred."
<br />
<br />Given that that sequence is probably, what, the second-most-common way (first-most-common being bit $2002, bpl) of testing for vblank or sprite 0 hit (well i suppose that would be bvc), hopefully you're logging *something* if it occurs?
