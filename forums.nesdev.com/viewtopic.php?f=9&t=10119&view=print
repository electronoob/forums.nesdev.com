Still unsure about those _en nodes though.

Here's a picture of the right edge of OAM:<br /><br /><img src="http://s14.postimg.org/tae58nudd/oam.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />It seems to use cross-coupled inverters like the SR latch example (one side is highlighted in the picture), which according to Wikipedia would make it SRAM (DRAM uses capacitors instead). Various places on the nesdev wiki call it dynamic memory though. Is that &quot;dynamic&quot; in a different sense, or is it some special DRAM variant like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory#1T_DRAM" class="postlink">1T DRAM</a>? (The description doesn't seem to match though.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sprite RAM cells don't actually have complete inverters on them - all they have is the pulldown transistors, relying entirely on wire capacitance to keep one of the two sides of the cell high (rather than having a pull-up resistor to do that) and drive the other side low. When the chip reads from a memory cell (actually from an entire row), it precharges the bus and then connects it to the cell, so the high side gets reinforced and the low side just gets drained away.<br /><br />For more information, look up &quot;4-transistor DRAM&quot;.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm getting some rough idea of how the OAM DRAM works (for reads anyway). Does the following sound correct?<br /><br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li> During the first phase, the bitlines are charged by opening up the transistors on the right-hand side to current using pclk0. At the end of this phase, pclk0 goes low, disconnecting power, but the bitlines remain charged through capacitance.</li><li> During the second phase, the now-charged bitlines are connected to the row of memory cells holding the bits to be read by opening up the corresponding spr_rowx line. Additionally, the spr_colx line corresponding to the bits to be read is open at this point, and the value that's let through is the value returned by the read.</li></ol><br />Additionally, the charged bitlines will help charge up the memory cells on the row that was &quot;opened&quot; (connected to the bitlines), preventing them from fading. This works by charging up the side of the memory cell that was high, while current on the other side will just drain to ground (since the high side will open up a pull-down transistor for the other side).<br /><br />(Things get a bit confusing since a &quot;row&quot; in Visual 2C02 actually has vertical orientation <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />)<br /><br />Edit: Looks like the pclk0 connection on the right isn't actually used in the simulator, so that no &quot;pre-charging&quot; of the bitlines happens. Clicking on the gates shows that there's no transistors there (though the visual display when nothing is selected is as-if there would be transistors there). Then the following comments on IRC make sense:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">01:45 &lt; _Q&gt; in visual2c02, the bus precharge lines aren't actually connected<br />01:45 &lt; _Q&gt; I manually deleted all of the transistors<br />01:45 &lt; _Q&gt; in the real chip, they're necessary<br />01:45 &lt; _Q&gt; but in the simulator, they cause timing glitches that destroy the data in the DRAM</div>
