		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I had sprite 0 added to a little program I am working on, and for some reason, it just doesn't work. I am either on nametable 0 ot 1 in the program, and it switches back and forth, and when the needed info on both is done, will switch to nametable #0. With this code, it is always on nametable 0 and is just perplexing me.
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Sprite0HitTest:<br />&nbsp; LDA $2002<br />&nbsp; AND #$40<br />&nbsp; BEQ Sprite0HitTest<br />&nbsp; LDA PPUCTRL<br />&nbsp; AND #$FE<br />&nbsp; STA $2000<br />&nbsp; RTS<br /></div><br /><br />I just need it to wait for it, and then write the MSB of the main nametable to 0. It just doesn't work though. I've tried BIT $2002 then BVC to loop it first, but that didn't work. I moved my sprite up and make sure it was on the background white pixel, but that's a no-go either. So I made the sprite the same as what it went over and moved it there and it still doesn't work at all. Would me doing the write in the middle of the scanline be affecting it? I also tried writing scroll too but that didn't do anything either. It's always 0 with this little program so that's not the problem either. So I'm kinda at a loss of what is causing this. If I do just a JSR/RTS from it, it works perfectly and the nametable switches as needed, but with it, it just breaks and stays on the nametable 0. I just can't figure this out. I'd post more code, but I am confident the problem is just this routine. The program even reflects the change when grabbing the characters, this just doesn't work.<br /><br />Thanks! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Got it to work, my problem is that I assumed at NMI being flagged it cleared, but I guess not, as this new code works for anybody else having this problem: [Somewhat aken from Nerdy Nights]<br /><br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Sprite0HitTest:<br />&nbsp; BIT $2002<br />&nbsp; BVS Sprite0HitTest ;Wait for it to be cleared for some reason. That reason is because if we run this inside of vblank, it is not instantly tripped, causing the splitting scroll to never happen.<br />Sprite0HitLoop:<br />&nbsp; BIT $2002<br />&nbsp; BVC Sprite0HitLoop ;Wait for it to hit again.<br />&nbsp; LDA PPUCTRL<br />&nbsp; AND #$FE<br />&nbsp; STA $2000<br />&nbsp; RTS<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Well, for anyone else who has a problem, hope this helps, sorry for posting a topic. Of course, 30 minutes of trying and I figure it out after I post a topic, ugh. So is it cleared at the start of rendering? Is that what happens?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not sure I can contribute with a solution to the problem, but is there any reason why you are not using the overflow flag to check for the hit? Here's what I mean:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Sprite0HitTest:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bit $2002<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bvc Sprite0HitTest</div><br />You make the loop that waits for a hit as fast as possible, to reduce the jitter that might result from too much timing fluctuation. Even without using the N or V flags it could be faster (I do this for detecting a sprite overflow):<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$20<br />WaitSpriteOverflow:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bit $2002<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;beq WaitSpriteOverflow</div><br /><br />Anyway, your problem might be that you are starting the wait for the hit too early. When a sprite hit happens, the flag will be set until the start of the next frame, which means that the flag remains set during VBlank. If you finish your VBlank updates and immediately start waiting for the hit, the hit flag will be set from the last frame, causing an instant nametable switch. The trick is to first wait for the flag to be cleared, and then wait for it to be set:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">WaitHitClear:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bit $2002<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bvs WaitHitClear<br />WaitHitSet:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bit $2002<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bvc WaitHitSet</div>
<br />
<br />EDIT: Heh, don't you just LOVE when programmers write comments containing sentences like <strong>"for some reason"</strong>? It shows that they have no clue about what they're doing. This is specially lovely when found in tutorial code. No offense. But yeah, the flag remains set until the end of VBlank.

<br />Okay, flag stays set until end of vblank, that's all I really needed to find out I guess to get it working. Thanks!

<br />It's the exact opposite... If you don't wait for the flag to be cleared, the hit is instantly tripped (because the flag is set from the last frame), causing the split to happen too soon (i.e. before rendering even starts). So, technically, it's not a "split", because rendering already started with the effect applied, but the effect was indeed applied.

Of course it would be even better if the VBlank flag stayed up until the end of VBlank (like the the people that programmed Nesticle assumed) instead of being cleared when read, but that's OK.

<br />I think this happens mainly with tutorials that explain only some of the things that are going on (like why you're clearing memory but not why you're setting the I flag and clearing the D flag, or other stuff like that).  I'm not really much for tutorials myself for that very reason (that they tend to exclude some essential stuff) but to each his or her own.

I use the wiki as a reference to hardware and then tutorials if it doesn't work, but I didn't reference a tutorial for Sprite 0 until after I posted this [Because NA is blocked at my school] but it explained it there that the flag isn't cleared until rendering starts, while the wiki fails to state so.

The easiest way to do this is to place an earlier check for D6 = 0."
