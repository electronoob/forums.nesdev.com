<br />
<br />Maybe today. But for most of PC history PC gaming was abysmal. I remember playing crap EGA games on my dad's DOS PC and envying my friends... who had cheap chinese Famiclones that were the most popular gaming device here in Slovakia in the 1990s. Even the Famicom's 54 colors were like true color compared to 16 garish colors and the 4 voice sound chip sounded like HD sound to me compared with the PC Speaker.  Later, when some of my friends got Playstations, it looked like a pinnacle of gaming and graphics to me. Price was not an issue, all games, whatever it was PC or consoles, were pirated, considering the average wage at the time was below 300 dollars per month and almost total lack of official games distribution channels (at least for the Famiclones, PS1 games were sold officialy, but would take third the average wage of a person in that time to buy, so out of reach for most people). Upgrades? We had an old 1991 386 until the year 1999.
<br />
<br />Anybody who ever had a DOS or a Windows 95 PC knows these things were total crap until Voodoo graphics came along. And yes, a very hi-end PC from 2000 might run GTA:SA. That is, for cca 20x the cost of a 2000 Playstation 2.
<br />
<br />Cost by cost, consoles win totally in gaming.

<br />And people who complain about some textures badly loading on the consoles in Skyrim don't get what the TES series is about. PC gamers also blame the lack of levitation in Oblivion and Skyrim on "consoles holding teh glorious PC games down", except that the original Morrowind had levitation on both PC and the first Xbox. Ooops.

<br />
<br />Typically people will buy only 1 console of the generation, especially when they are budget constrained. And this means that even if you bought all 3 consoles it would cost only about 2/3 of my single computer. My computer rocks, but it is a 8 GB 8 core monster that I wouldn't have if my family did not have such an above average income. And it still crashes all the time and fails to run some games due to stupid driver incompatibility. Xbox360 (that has 512 MB RAM) would run the games I have just as well as my PC, just with a bit blurrier textures and not as fast framerate. So? If I hadn't had such a good PC, and if I had hands suited for a gamepad I'd buy the console. I find the graphics of many NES games nice, I wouldn't care about some texture being a tiny bit blurrier, I am not a graphics wh**e who compares tiny differences in screenshots of Skyrim on retarded fanboy Youtube vids and then proceeds to declare SKYRIM LOOKS BETTER ON MY 3000 DOLLARS PC THAN ON THOSE POORFAG CONSOLES ALL HAIL THE MASTER PC GAMING RACE.
<br />
<br />Yes, a PC can be better than a console by having 4x more cores and 16x more RAM. That is the only thing PCs were ever good at, throwing megahertz on a thing until it was solved, unlike all the 8-bits, non-PC 16-bits and the consoles that actually had to make a decent architecture instead of being a piece of shit that lags with the newest ICQ on 2 Ghz PCs even if the original ICQ version run on 486s.
<br />
<br />And bugs in the PS3 version of Skyrim are there because Bethesda is known for releasing badly buggy software sometimes (the PC-only Daggerfall was so bugged that it was actually impossible to complete without a patch).

<br />Whatever. USA is not closer to me than Japan. What matters is that it runs 3D games on 1994 hardware. It came out in Europe in 1995 too, but it is a Japanese console after all. In Nigeria, the PS2 came out in 2008, does that mean PS2 is 2008 hardware?

<br />Thanks for this explaination about how things went in your area during the 90s.
<br />I guess in the early 90s your country was very hurt because of the communism so it make sense you had Famiclones like Russia and China.
<br />It's fun how you mention you had pirated NES and PS1, but not any pirated SNES or Megadrive. Did they completely skip this generation ?
<br />
<br />I remember I also had my dad's old 486 PC up to year 2003 or so. Good old times... (or not). You bet I played very old games with it, and the only emulator fast enough for it was Nesticle.

<br />
<br />I wouldn't really blame communism that much. The situation here (from what I know from older people around me) was not like in 1980s Poland, Romania or USSR where the foreign currency deficit crisis hit the hardest. The people who came immediatly after it were much worse. For what I know from people older than me the 90s were a lot worse than the 80s. There was some gaming in the 80s too, mostly on ZX Spectrum (we had a ZX clone called Didaktik with 80 KB RAM but some people had the original ZX too), Atari XL and C64. Not many people had it through, imports were hard to get and domestic Didaktik computers were in demand by schools and other organizations. Almost everybody learned some IT at school (and of course they played games when the teacher was not paying attention or allowed them). There were also PMD-85 computers that almost every school had and was basically like ZX Spectrum, but monochrome (well, 4 colors really but most software was done in monochrome as color TVs were not much available) and using an Intel 8080 clone instead of Z80 (TESLA MHB 8080).

<br />
<br />But seeing as how the C64 is basically a console with a keyboard and some IO chips added. 
<br />
<br />I know the Amiga was originally suppose to be a game console too, but again, commodore turned it into a computer...
<br />
<br />Didn't the C64 start out as a game machine, but commodore ended up making it a computer?
