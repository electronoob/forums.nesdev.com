		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It'd probably be pretty hard to get a bunch of people to work together because of idea clash.  I think most people who have the skills to make games, or are acquiring the skills to make them,  have pretty specific ideas about what they'd like to do. 
<br />
<br /> I've had problems in the past working with friends.  It's difficult telling someone who's working for free that their graphic design isn't uniform enough, or the monster they designed not only doesn't fit the graphic style, but doesn't even fit the game at all.
<br />
<br />  That being said, if you had a good team together, and they can work well together, it would be possible to make something very amazing.

<br />I think that'd be one of the easiest steps in the process.

My goal is to try to modularize things, so my level editor just pumps out pretty basic stuff, and that my level compressor organizes it into a compact format that I can use. That way, I can work on making the level editor as intuitive and easy to use (for me) as I can make it, and if I decide to change my level compression format or someone else thinks the format sucks and wants to use there own it would be pretty simple to change it.<br /></div><br /><br />Sounds good, I hope to see that released.  Can it provide a 2nd layer for hit detection, or does it deal with that kind of stuff?  (yeah it can be just part of the metatile attribute, generally)<br /><br />What's nice with an editor is that you can hand it off to someone who isn't necessarily a programmer.  It makes it infinitely easier to collaborate with people.  I thought it was great how some early NES games even included a level editor inside the game (but they really got the shaft, since the tape drive never came out).</div>
<br />
<br />I love games with 2nd layer collision.  Its a horribly underused gameplay mechanic.
