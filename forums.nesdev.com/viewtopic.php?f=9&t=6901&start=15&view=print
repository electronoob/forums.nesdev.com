		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Great Success! That you all for your diag tips. Starting small with just watching pin 39 go high and then working up from there was a great idea! I have my bare 2A03 breadboarded and producing a 440Hz Square wave.
<br />
<br />To summarize the past week of my work:
<br />
<br />I tested a donor NES with Time Lord. It worked in good condition.
<br />Taking a page from the NESpander, I desoldered and ripped out the expansion slot. From this I broke out the Data pins and +5V and GND.
<br />
<br />I found a few vias which served well as breakout points for A0, A1, and A2, as well as R/W and M2(explained soon).
<br />
<br />After connecting the somewhat complex "ROM" provided by kevtris to this broken-out NES system, I fired up the code suggested by blargg, and after a few reconnected wires and pokes and prods, my oscope showed a high on pin 39!
<br />
<br />I moved on to the next step, which was trying out the noise channel, which also worked well.
<br />
<br />Turning to the APU basics page, I tried out the square wave, but was getting odd results. After playing with my code and making it cleaner, but still with no result, I tried probing around for a different interrupt point. So far, I've found M2 on the CPU pinout works very well. Is this pin ever used for anything else?
<br />
<br />After the square wave code was verified to be working, I ported the bare 2A03 I got from arcadecomponents to my breadboard, and reconnected the wires. Using one of the unused 74HCT04 inverters as a Pierce oscillator ( =) ) I achieved the same results as when I was using the actual NES.
<br />
<br />I've moved on to trying a triangle wave, but it doesn't seem to work well. I'm trying to mimic this from the APU Basics page:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda #&lt;139<br />sta $400A<br /><br />lda #&gt;139<br />sta $400B<br /><br />lda #%11000000<br />sta $4008<br />sta $4017<br /></div>
<br />
<br />but all my speaker is doing is sputtering and occasionally spitting out some noises. I updated the code, here is the source again:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://personal.stevens.edu/~jlupinsk/code.txt">http://personal.stevens.edu/~jlupinsk/code.txt</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Does anyone have any tips for getting the triangle wave generator to work? In the mean time I'll be designing a breadboard for both using a cartridge to make sounds (Let me know if you would be interested in an open-source MIDINes =) ), as well as a synth using the bare chip.

<br />
<br />Can you run a test where you feed $4011 an increasing byte value at a regular interval? This would give a clear indication of any bit errors, and how regular your timing is.

<br />
<br />It's really odd. If I use only

<br />$4015 - 0F 
<br />$4002 - 17
<br />$4003 - 00
<br />$4000 - BF
<br />$401F - AA
<br />
<br />I can hear a nice square wave.
<br />
<br />But if I do the whole initialization step, and then run that snippet above, nothing comes out. 
<br />
<br />I'm upgrading my processor soon (getting a 72Mhz ARM beast =3 ), so I'll try again, just in case it is a timing error, but in the mean time, does the initilization step look sound? ....hehe....sound...
<br />
<br />Edit: Oh snap I got a saw wave to come out. I realized I have to loop the instructions to get the wave XP silly me. It works without any sort of initialization.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://personal.stevens.edu/~jlupinsk/workingsawcode.txt" class="postlink">http://personal.stevens.edu/~jlupinsk/workingsawcode.txt</a>
<br />
<br />So I guess there is something wrong with the initialization step?
<br />
<br />Edit 2: Got triangle wave working. I guess following the APU Basics page's code examples are valid only if you're actually programming the NES? Writing C0 to $4017 as suggested in the APU Basics page silences the channel.

<br />
<br />As for the triangle, it's not a simple matter of "writing $C0 to $4017 silences triangle", since there's internal state involved. I suggest you move on and do some things with the other channels, and we can get the triangle issue worked out eventually. It might be due to a bug of the APU basics page (not initializing the triangle state fully). It's just not something I can mentally switch to to investigate right now.

<br />
<br />Oh nice, I just recently started on an STM32 dev board. It's the same chip. It's really powerful, especially with DMA. 
<br />
<br />I found my original code for testing channels. Since it was all very ad hoc just to make sure my CPLD interface was working, I didn't comment it very well. The register reads and writes are pretty clear, though.
<br />
<br />The first thing to note is that the 2A03 is turned on while RES is held low. If I turned the 2A03 on while reset was high or floating, resetting after the fact didn't quite seem to work. I had to hold RES low (asserted), then power on the 2A03, then wait a couple milliseconds, then release RES. After that I could read and write registers. That was the only sequence that gave me consistent results. 
<br />
<br />Before the main loop I have this:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">codeout&#40;0x1F, 0x15&#41;;<br /></div><br /><br />Then I made small tests for each channel. This was for the triangle wave:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">codeout&#40;0x00, 0x11&#41;;&nbsp; &nbsp; //max volume<br />codeout&#40;0xFF, 0x08&#41;;<br />codeout&#40;0x00, 0x0A&#41;;<br />codeout&#40;0xF1, 0x0B&#41;;<br />for&#40;n=0;n&lt;=254;n++&#41;<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; codeout&#40;n, 0x0A&#41;;<br />&nbsp; Delay_us&#40;5000&#41;;<br />&#125;<br />codeout&#40;0x00, 0x08&#41;;<br /></div><br /><br />Square wave 1:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">codeout&#40;0x7F, 0x00&#41;;<br />codeout&#40;0x00, 0x01&#41;;<br />codeout&#40;0x6F, 0x02&#41;;<br />codeout&#40;0xF8, 0x03&#41;;<br />for&#40;n=0;n&lt;=254;n++&#41;<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; codeout&#40;n, 0x02&#41;;<br />&nbsp; Delay_us&#40;3000&#41;;<br />&#125;<br />codeout&#40;0x3F, 0x00&#41;;<br />for&#40;n=0;n&lt;=254;n++&#41;<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; codeout&#40;n, 0x02&#41;;<br />&nbsp; Delay_us&#40;3000&#41;;<br />&#125;<br />codeout&#40;0x00, 0x00&#41;;<br /></div><br /><br />Square wave 2:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">codeout&#40;0x7F, 0x04&#41;;<br />codeout&#40;0x00, 0x05&#41;;<br />codeout&#40;0x6F, 0x06&#41;;<br />codeout&#40;0xF8, 0x07&#41;;<br />for&#40;n=0;n&lt;=254;n++&#41;<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; codeout&#40;n, 0x06&#41;;<br />&nbsp; Delay_us&#40;3000&#41;;<br />&#125;<br />codeout&#40;0x3F, 0x04&#41;;<br />for&#40;n=0;n&lt;=254;n++&#41;<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; codeout&#40;n, 0x06&#41;;<br />&nbsp; Delay_us&#40;3000&#41;;<br />&#125;<br />codeout&#40;0x00, 0x04&#41;;<br /></div><br /><br />Noise:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">codeout&#40;0x3F, 0x0C&#41;;<br />codeout&#40;0xF8, 0x0F&#41;;<br />for&#40;n=0;n&lt;=15;n++&#41;<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; codeout&#40;0x00 + n, 0x0E&#41;;<br />&nbsp; Delay_us&#40;10000&#41;;<br />&nbsp; for&#40;m=15;m&gt;=1;m--&#41;<br />&nbsp; &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; codeout&#40;m + 0x30, 0x0C&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Delay_us&#40;5000&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &#125;<br />&#125;<br />codeout&#40;0x30, 0x0C&#41;;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />codeout(data, address) writes data to $4000 + address. So codeout(0x3F, 0x0C) will write 3F to 0x400C. Delay_us() is a delay function in microseconds. I believe this .wav file was from that test (starting with square waves):

<br />
<br />I've been quietly following this thread in excitement! How's it going?
<br />
<br />I'm currently controlling a SID with my arduino and have a NES in front of me urging to have it's APU abused.
<br />
<br />I would love to get a hold of your schematics if possible some time. 
<br />
<br />I'm hoping to wire your circuit to a cartridge pcb like the repropak ( I'm assuming it's going to be feasible) so I can write to the apu without taking the nes apart. Leds + translucent carts = vu meters galore
<br />
<br />Good luck and look forward to hearing from you!
