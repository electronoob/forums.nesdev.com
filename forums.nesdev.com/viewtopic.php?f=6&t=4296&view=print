<br />
<br />I'd say the biggest problem with mml is not the interface (or lack thereof) but the pitiful support the format has in the states. For people to learn quickly they need to have useful examples. They need to study from the pros. I have managed to find this site that provides the nsf AND the mml used to compose the tune.

<br />Do any of you know of places like this that are a treasure trove for the mml composer?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />tutorials are nice and all but this is more in practice information rather than "how to code in mml, the guide". I mean you can learn all the stuff but what good is it if you don't know how to make good tunes? That is what this topic is geared to.
<br />
<br />While 2a03.org and the like are nice, they don't show you the mml along with the nsf. Having the mml to look at is vital, in fact it is the single best way to learn at all. Otherwise, you're just making blind guesses.

<br />In the general case, I imagine it wouldn't be any better than NSF to MIDI. Imagine what would happen if I gave it an NSF made with something other than MCK, such as NT2, Famitracker, or (gosh forbid) a commercial game's engine.

<br />Tons of Famitracker sources, only few MMLs, whatever. :/
<br />Actually FamiTracker may help to better understand MML as many of the concepts used are similar between the two (volume envelopes etc).

<br />What about a progamm that would see if a NSF uses a known revision of MCK (shares the same replay code), and if so would take data and make a MML file back from it ? I guess that would be possible, but you'd probably lose comments and some other information as well (like Java decompilers who can return java code).
<br />
<br />If anoter NSF is input the programm would just tell "No known version MML driver detected". This would be practical, as I've made MML but lost the MML file and only have the NSF back, which is quite sad.

But the player code is different, and it also differs depending on whether you've enabled any of the extra features, such as MMC5, N106, VRC6 etc.
