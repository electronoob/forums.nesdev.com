Before this heats up too far, I'll give the verdict: In some games, it's an art style decision. In others, especially when it happens inconsistently, it's a physics bug.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://pics.pineight.com/dwi/secret_bear.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />Talk to the tummy.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Feb 20, 2010 9:53 am</p><hr />

Oh, it's irrelevant, hm? Well, you know what's irrelevant too? Talking about NES games. And posting in a forum to discuss them. Actually, NES games themselves are completely irrelevant for life. Only a bunch of 0s and 1s that are represented as colored dots on a TV screen. So, please stop talking about them and please stop playing them because all that is irrelevant. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4180">JohnJohn</a> — Sat Feb 20, 2010 8:04 am</p><hr />

To be honnest I never noticed anything about characters being in the ground, it don't look weird at all to me. Even the Kirby completely in the ground don't look weird to me - it just looks a bit 3D like in Double Dragon (but to a smaller scale).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Feb 20, 2010 3:38 am</p><hr />
