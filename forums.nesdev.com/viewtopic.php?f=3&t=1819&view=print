<br />The trouble is, that adds a considerable amount of complexity to emulators, as it requires them to address PRG/CHR not only by banks, but by chips as well, making it considerably more difficult to share any code between iNES and UNIF mapper code (or even between two different UNIF boardspecs which happen to share the same basic mapper, such as the MMC3).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />well my knowledge of all the nes games is limited.  but i like the unif format better for the chunks that is has, easier to work with.  i was thinking that new chunks could be add/used instead of the board name to overcome these problems.  incase of 2 or more chunks with conflicting data then i would assume the later takes precedence or the emulator would refuse to load it.  is it possible to come up with new chunks?   if necessary have an ines, INES,  chuck with the current header information.  or have a mapper section, MMC, that would have the mappter name.  these are some of the ideas i had.  not sure if they make sence as i said earlier my knowledge fof all the games is limited.
<br />
<br />i thought boodgod was working a rom database to repair roms?  i dont have windows so i can not use goodNES and its closed source.   so the goodNES is meaningless to me.

<br />
<br />Incorrect! GoodNES is primarily a map between PRG+CHR CRC-32 checksums and game names, stored in a text file (as far as I can tell, since I don't have a Windows machine either). Anything can use this text databse; I even did a search-and-replace to convert it to a C-language array of strings and checksums so it'd be directly accessible without any parsing.

<br />That's easy: build a lookup table of all PRG bank values from 0 to 255 that map from logical banks to physical banks. In boards with a smaller ROM than the maximum the mapper can address, the higher ones would point down to the lower ones. (For a 256 KB PRG in an MMC3, the table would be 0..31 repeated 8 times.) In multi-chip boards, all the bank values on the missing chip 2 would point to the corresponding locations in chip 3 or wherever.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I hate to necro this thread, but recently Tennessee Carmel-Veilleux has asked that I become the maintainer of UNIF (since I created the first implementation of UNIF in libunif found at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://code.google.com/p/libunif/">http://code.google.com/p/libunif/</a><!-- m -->). So, I just wanted to let everyone know that I will be hosting the latest version of the standard at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://codef00.com/unif_cur.txt">http://codef00.com/unif_cur.txt</a><!-- m --> for as long as I own the domain.
<br />
<br />Likewise, while I know that iNES 2.0 is probably the goto ROM standard for NES, since I will be maintaining UNIF, I am happy to discuss any improvements that can be made to the UNIF standard.
<br />
<br />Thanks
