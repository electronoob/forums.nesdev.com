		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a bunch of famicom sachen multi's and have been having fun taking them apart tonight.
<br />
<br />Most have eproms for the chr and the prg and the mapper is always a glop top.  Some have prg glop tops--but they're always on a little glop top to dip 32 converter...  Then a few have all glop tops.
<br />
<br />It doesn't seem to matter how many games are on the multies, they mostly use the same circuit board (marked tc-30-3).  Most of the different boards seem to be versions of the same  (found ones marked marked tc-30 and tc-30-2 so far--tc-30 is also marked SAV1212 and looks different than the other two).  Poker III is the only one not marked tc-30 and has sa-630.
<br />
<br />Did sachen use more than one multi mapper or are they all the same mapper?
<br />
<br />The few individule sachen roms availiable all seem to have different mappers according to their ines header.  Do they really use different mappers?  Some of those individule games are on some of these multis.  Jovial race is on one of these multi's so I don't think they can all be little nrom games.  Jovial race also seems to have it's very own mapper according to the mapper list.
<br />
<br />Is it worth my effort to try and dump some of these?  
<br />
<br />I know that there may not be answers out there, but I'm just kinda curious since I started opening these up...
