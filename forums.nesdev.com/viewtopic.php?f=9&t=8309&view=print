<br />BTW I made an offer on the CPU/PPUs a while back, but never heard if it was too low or what.  It'd be cool to get some, but I have limited time for guessing what price you'll want for them.

<br />
<br />I agree that you should post prices for things if you're going to sell them here.  If you want to run an auction (i.e. "make me an offer... but if I don't like your offer I will tell you I want more... but won't say how much more")  then use ebay.
<br />
<br />If you gotta get $5 a pop for those chips, just say so. "I'd really like to get around 5 buck each for these, but I'm open to offers"  would clear everything up.  Maybe someone will offer you 5 bucks each for all?  If not, you can always accept a lower offer.   Playing the guessing game isn't fun for anyone and is just highly annoying.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I find your attitude very irritating 80sfreak. It's true that's its annoying to have someone offer stuff but then doesn't give price or doesn't seem to want to sell. Your post about the CPU even led to believe you were offering them for free or close to free. Even more annoying is how you chose to reply to people that were trying to stay polite with you. I guess that with the kind of reply you're posting to member we really shouldn't try to stay polite with you. You might have better luck on a different board where people aren't as "sensitive" and are not trying to "get bargain" as much.

<br />Yeah, there's a similar forum I used to be on that prohibited mentioning any online store by name except in a single "retailer feedback" forum that had one topic per store.

<br />No, I don't want or need it.  I just find it annoying that you've been trying to use the forum like an auction house while implying that you're doing us a favour.  
<br />
<br />I'm not "too sensitive" or anything of the sort;  I just do not want to see this forum devolve into your personal garage sale / auction floor.
