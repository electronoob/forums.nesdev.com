Here, I'll discuss the method I developed for nemulator.<br /><br />Most emulators sync to the audio playback rate and adjust the video rate to accommodate. This results in tearing (no vsync) or stuttering when scrolling (vsync).  nemulator syncs to the video frame rate, and continuously adjusts the audio rate to match.  The result is smooth video and glitch-free audio.  Here's a block diagram of how it's done.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;audio callback -&gt; sound card<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;^<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />input -&gt; low pass -&gt; resampler -&gt; high pass -&gt; output buffer<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;^&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+---------feedback----------+<br /><br /></div><br /><br />Input is audio at its native rate (1.79MHz in the case of NES).  The input is low-pass filtered and then passed to the arbitrary rate resampler.  The output from the resampler is high pass filtered, then stored in an output buffer.  When the soundcard needs data, the callback function is invoked, pulling data from the buffer.<br /><br />Each frame, a frame's worth of audio data is processed.  When it is placed in the circular output buffer, the distance between the write and play cursors is measured.  The goal is to keep this distance consistent between frames so that the audio buffer doesn't underflow, resulting in audio glitches, and so that no blocking occurs while waiting for the buffer to drain, resulting in delayed frames/video glitches.<br /><br />The feedback block:<br />- Low pass filters the distance measurement<br />- Adds that measurement to a circular buffer containing the last 60 measurements (1 second)<br />- Computes the slope of those measurements<br />- Adjusts the resampler output rate based on how far the distance is from the target and whether it's converging on or diverging from that target<br /><br />I've created a sample SDL app that implements this system.  Source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/jslepicka/audio_sync" class="postlink">github</a>, or you can download a Windows version <a href="http://nemulator.com/files/audio_sync.exe" class="postlink">here</a> (requires <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.5-win32-x86.zip" class="postlink">sdl2.dll</a>).  I've only tested this on Windows, but it should work on other platforms.  A few notes:<br />- nemulator uses DirectSound without callbacks, which permits for more accurate measurement of the audio buffer's cursors and, thus, better synchronization<br />- Accuracy in this app is limited by the callback frequency (every 512 samples), so some tweaking may be required<br />- Pre- and post- resampler filtering is not implemented<br />- Input to the resampler should be at least 8x oversampled<br />- The green line represents the distance measurement, the red line represents the resampler output frequency<br />- If your display isn't running at 60Hz, this won't work properly<br /><br /><img src="http://nemulator.com/images/audio_sync.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />James

Like, you're offering a choice between occasional skipped frames, tearing, or audio distortion, right? Not sure which is the best of these options. (Maybe ideally you can choose!)<br /><br />One thing I might suggest, though, if you're using a sync-to-audio solution, you could slightly adjust the clock rate so that 1 frame worth of cycles = reported vsync rate. Doing this would greatly reduce the frequency of dropped frames, while detuning the output pitch just the slightest amount (at least for a 60hz monitor).

I find visual artifacts, like stuttering while scrolling, to be intolerable.  That said, the audio pitch changes made by this method are inaudble to me.  On my system, the frequency in the SDL version varies over about a 30Hz range (.06%).  The DirectSound version does even better, with a variance of only a few Hz.  Both are below the threshold of audibility (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)#Just-noticeable_difference" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)#Just-noticeable_difference</a>).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">you could slightly adjust the clock rate so that 1 frame worth of cycles = reported vsync rate</div><br />It may not have been clear, but this does rely on vsync at 60Hz*.  So this is, in effect, exactly what I'm doing.<br /><br />* Or, e.g., FreeSync and a 50Hz clock source.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In my emulator I allow the option.  If you choose to sync to video frame rate, it will produce more or less audio to match.... which can be accomplished by running audio channels for more/fewer cycles as needed without actually changing the clock rate.<br /><br />This is complicated by the DMC, which has CPU-visible side-effects (IRQs, stolen cycles).  To solve that, I run 2 separate DMC units side-by-side.  The &quot;DMCPU&quot; which is not audible but does the DMA and generates IRQs.  And a separate audible DMC which is what you actually hear.<br /><br />This results in smooth video + smooth audio playback with no pitch changes, regardless of the framerate (so it even works for something like Fast-Forward).  Only exception being raw, timed $4011 writes, which will crackle a bit due to no longer being spaced properly. But games which use those are pretty rare.

Just query it from the hardware!</s> <em>Edit: Koitsu points out that APIs for this are inadequate. Maybe just measure it and let user override manually?</em><br /><br />I don't believe drift over time is significant here. Have you really encountered this with modern monitors or sound cards? (e.g. I've never found a computer sound device to be measurably out of tune, at least not in any of the many times I've tuned a musical device to one.)<br /><br />However. I did say this was part of the &quot;sync video to audio&quot; solution where occasionally you have to display a frame twice (or skip display of a frame) to resync. If there's a small amount of mismatch for some reason this will occasionally do that to correct. I said &quot;almost never&quot; because I'd expect it to be so infrequent as to be essentially nonexistant.<br /><br />If your monitor isn't running close to the game's target refresh rate (i.e.  50 or 60hz) then you're going to be living with doubled/skipped frames anyway. Some people want NES accurate timing, too, so they also must live with that for its nonstandard 60.1hz rate. That tends to be quite noticeable though because it's a frame skipped every 10 seconds.<br /><br /><br />Edit: On the subject of drift over time this website claims to be a vsync test: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.vsynctester.com/index.html">https://www.vsynctester.com/index.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />On this laptop it thinks the real refresh rate is 60.002 Hz, so we're talking about one frame doubled every 8 minutes. Is that not insignificant? I think that's pretty good?
