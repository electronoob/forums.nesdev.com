During that time we have streamlined a process for producing original content, the Nesdev Compo. That process is soon going to leave the initial idea far behind in it's dust. So I am going to help assemble the master version of Action 53.<br /><br />What I propose is that we continue normally with producing Volume 4 and in parallel I'll work on assembling the master 16mbit cartridge. We are over 53 games already so it very possible that volume 4 will contain games and things not found in this proposed master version. My target release date will be Thanksgiving 2020 and there's a lot to be done. While I'm not as busy as tepples I too need to spend time to keep food on my plate and a roof over my head.<br /><br />I recently got tepples's workfiles for the previous volumes, and I'll be working from that. I'll still have to search the fourm threads and web links to find improved versions. Rom size is a big concern, so analyzing that is what I'm working on first.<br /><br />I will write later on what I think would be good criteria for inclusion.<br /><br />Edit 1: removed the dot from the topic name.

Helmet's Training Day (NROM256)<br />- Sir Ababol (NROM256)<br />- Wo Xiang Niao Niao (NROM256)<br />- Cheril the Goddess (UNROM)<br />- Lala the Magical (UNROM)<br />- Zombie Calavera Prologue (NROM256)<br /><br />Let me know what would be best for you and I'll post them in the way you prefer.<br /><br />Sgt Helmet's Training Day and Sir Ababol were Mojontwins' first two NES games, so the version available in Action 53 vol.2 is pretty ancient. Both games have been much improved ever since (i.e. rewriten from scratch!).

Later I'm going to work on fixing up QABG because I think there's a memory corruption bug somewhere in there that I need to fix, but once that's out of the way you've got a four-player game for the cart.<br /><br />I did keep <em>Nova the Squirrel</em> mapper 28 compatible for this purpose, but it's probably too big (~160KB) and requires extra RAM. That might be best as its own release.

That could enable contributors to do content that isn't &quot;E for everyone&quot; and still get it included without altering their original concept.</div><br />Is there still interest in this?<br /><br />If so I have a thought of a easy to implement mechanism. A key sequence (of no less then 8 buttons) would be inputted at the a53 menu, which then passes the unlock setting to the game as a particular byte via CPU register Y and RAM location $00ff [1]. Of course it's temporary and would have to be inputted every reset.<br /><br />[1]: tepples, I'm aware of the memory clear loop. It would simply be moved downward by one byte.

Though we don't plan on seeking a rating by ESRB, I do recognize that the practice of ESRB is the industry's common practice.<br /><br />Would it be too much trouble to offer <em>Action 53</em> and <em>Action 53 (Unrated)</em> SKUs?

The hairy bit is coming up with a standard for what is called family friendly, in which case modeling it after some industry standard might be the simplest option. The method for how we present/lock content doesn't really need to comply with any standard, though.

A TODO item I have is to confirm that those permissions exist or need to be sought.</li><li> Must fit. Source code availability would be preferred so that game code can be relocated and improved.</li><li> Be well made.</li><li> References or likeness to some point about NES bootleg. The fact we are having a multicart is a homage to the various xx-in-1 multicarts, and that the title of &quot;Action 53&quot; specifically calls out a specific infamous one. The limit of &quot;53 games&quot; doesn't necessarily mean we are limited to 53 things.</li><li> Uniqueness between games. One aspect of the xx-in-1 multicarts we will <em>not</em> be doing is the repeated re-skinning of a single game to pad out the game numbers.</li><li> Games should be complete and not just demos of full releases outside of this multicart. I found this to be a good heuristic to fulfill the &quot;Must fit&quot; guideline.</li></ul>

The cartridge price is going to be $53 USD to make it $1 for every game on it (can't find the fourm thread ATM). At that price there's going to be a profit. The question is where should those profits should go <span style="font-size: 50%; line-height: normal">(not ever going to be 100% into my pockets)</span>. I guess I could easily just direct profits to the <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=14015" class="postlink">nesdev compo fund</a> but this isn't really part of the compo series, or does that even mater?<br /><br />The other thoughts more in line with the original linked thread topic. I think it might be best both publicity wise, and for the option of donating, to release on <a href="https://itch.io/" class="postlink">itch.io</a> for the digital release.

Pressing a button to reprobe is not reliable if there's no button to press other than the button to start the test for that controller, such as the Zapper and Arkanoid Controller that have only one button. But yes, I agree that it'd be good to include, provided that we can notify the user that Reset acts differently in this program from the rest of the collection.<br /><br />It's OK if I pull changes from your fork, correct?
