It's good to have multiple info sites, though I'm sure my club is going to be real informative (imply sarcasm). It's just so you can talk about NESdev and stuff related to the NES. It's just so you can talk about NESdev, and stuff. Sorry, I don't know where I'm going with this one, so I'll stop talking.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just went to Nintendo's website.  Apparently, what they oppose about emulators is the fact that they are used to play commercial roms, not so much the fact that they emulate the hardware of the old systems.  They are quite specific, referring to "emulators used to play illegally copied Nintendo software" and pointing out the infringement of copyright and intellectual property laws as applied to commercial roms.
<br />
<br />The creation of new roms doesn't fall under those laws, though Nintendo didn't really take kindly to people selling unlicensed software.  This was settled a long time ago, however, and it is not illegal.

<br />
<br />But I think the point was that it isn't illegal, just that Nintendo's legal page could be called misleading (and certainly could've been called flat-out wrong when it used to say any emulators were illegal).
