		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My idea isn't fully fleshed out yet, but I want to rip DPCM sound from games and play them back on a microcontroller.
<br />
<br />I did some fooling around with the 18.exe tool from pineight.com and got some sounds. I was able to pull out the the drum sample and some slashing sound from Ninja Gaiden but I had problems with Gauntlet 2. I can make out the potion noise and some really garbled voice samples but it sounds nothing like it does on real hardware or an emulator. I played with the bitrate and found that 21.3k seems to have the proper pitch. I used a low pass filter and played with the EQ but it's still unintelligible. I figured it might be 7-bit PCM but I shouldn't hear anything recognizable after ripping it as 1-bit DPCM if it were, right?
<br />So does anyone know how Gauntlet 2 encodes it's samples?
<br />
<br />Also, playback is as simple as incrementing/decrementing a 6-bit DAC at one of the 16 playback speeds, isn't it? Otherwise I've totally missed something.
<br />
<br />Thanks!
<br />
<br />EDIT: I've got the Ninja Gaiden slash sample playing back on my dac setup. The speed isn't right and the resistors are mismatched, but all things considered, it sounds pretty ok.
<br />Now I just need "Red warrior shot the food!". Can anyone help?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I know some of the sounds would pause the game, but I could be thinking of the first Gauntlet.  It probably is done with the $4011 register.  It was kinda low quality, I think you would get better results by recording sounds from the arcade version, resample to the best DPCM rate, then convert to 8-bit, then to 1-bit.
<br />
<br />If you want to try that, get BridgeM1 (or something similar), it's a frontend for the M1 sound emulator.
<br />
<br />But yeah, DPCM would be really easy to play on a microcontroller.

<br />When I use audacity and import it as 8bit unsigned, little endian it doesn't sound quite right. I know the NES uses 7-bit but isn't it stored as 7-bits packed in a byte?
<br />Also, what's a good way to find the start, end and sample rate of specific samples? Could I disassemble and look for writes to a specific register?
<br />
<br />I'm really fond of the NES gauntlet 2 sounds and would like to reproduce them specifically.
<br />
<br />I didn't realize how simple some audio formats are. I banged out functional playback code in record time.

<br />Good call! It looks like that's exactly what it does.
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDA &#40;$D1&#41;,Y @ $9253 = #$98<br />BEQ $F494<br />INY<br />STY $00D0 = #$01<br />AND #$F0<br />LSR<br />STA $4011 = #$FF</div><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDY #$00<br />LDA &#40;$D1&#41;,Y @ $9252 = #$78<br />AND #$0F<br />ASL<br />ASL<br />ASL<br />STA $4011 = #$FF</div>
<br />
<br />Now I can just clone this code on my microcontroller and reap the benefits.

<br />Stingray, or gate, dice? ...Skate, or, die.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> 
<br />Sir tepples, I had found that thread and used the script. It works wonders, should be stickied! 
<br />I had been opening a hex dump in notepad++ and using a macro to insert a zero every other character, then importing it in a hex editor. I knew I should have used a script but I've only written one before that accesses files.
<br />
<br />I think the playback is correct. Here's that section:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ISR&#40;TIMER2_OVF_vect&#41; &#123;<br />&nbsp; temp = table&#91;i&#93;;<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; if &#40;shift_count == 0&#41;&#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PORTD = temp &amp; 0b11110000;<br />&nbsp; &#125;else&#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PORTD = &#40;temp &lt;&lt; 4&#41; &amp; 0b11110000;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; i++;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; shift_count = 0;<br />&nbsp; &#125;<br />&nbsp; shift_count++;<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; TCNT2=66;<br />&nbsp; if&#40;i==2325&#41;&#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; i=0;<br />&nbsp; &#125;<br />&#125;</div>
<br />
<br />I'm working off of borrowed code. I'm going to change the counter to "compare" instead of "overflow". Hopefully that will make the speed more precise. 
<br />I don't get why TCNT2 wants 66. My thinking is this: 16MHz(clock)/32(counter prescale)= 500,000/5265hz= 95; 256-95=161. That way the counter is loaded with 161 and counts 95 before it overflows. Ohwell.

<br />I got compare mode to work though. It's not very well documented on arduinos. You have to read the atmega*8 datasheet and guess what the arduino will call the variables.
<br />
<br />It's all fixed and working now.
