		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm working on some minimal ca65 examples for new NES programmers and would like comments. Below is what I came up with as the absolute minimum example that does something and doesn't need <em>any</em> other files, not even a .cfg (it uses ld65's build-in NES configuration). This eliminates the main reason I previously preferred nesasm, that of not needing any extra configuration files. The built-in configuration isn't great (vectors start at $FFF4 and some other minor things), but it's fully usable for examples.

<br />
<br />This example is fairly short yet allows text display, which is important for an early example. I tried to avoid using subroutines, since I want as few distractions as possible. Provide your own ascii.chr font if you're trying to assemble it.
<br />
<br />(again, this thread isn't for helping people with these examples, it's for refining them <em>before</em> they are offered as tutorials)

<br />I noticed that this code does not write to PPUCTRL after filling VRAM. Writing to PPUCTRL sets the VRAM address corresponding to which of the four nametables is used for the pixel at the top-left corner of the screen. If this isn't done, the values of these bits can be hard for a beginner to predict if the program has just loaded an attribute table. I follow the guideline of always writing to PPUCTRL when writing to PPUSCROLL before a frame starts.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />tepples, here are some that use a shell to cover really basic 6502 stuff. With this we can go very slowly and make it easy for the learner to try different things without having to know anything about NES programming:

<br /><a href="http://blargg.fileave.com/temp/blargg_nes_tutorial.zip" class="postlink">blargg_nes_tutorial.zip</a>
<br />
<br />bunnyboy suggested to provide a batch file to assemble these, in an attempt to avoid the learner ever having to use the command-line. I think if a few of us got together, we could make a good set of tutorials to get someone up to the level of basic PPU graphics, scrolling, and sprites.

I'll have to take a look at the simulators.

<br />
<br />i've messed around with C++ and C++ books for over 7 years on and off. but i'm still a major noob. never really practiced much in that time. took on a few projects and took it very seriously, but at the time it might have been too much for me to do on my own. 
<br />
<br />for example, i've run the STK(synthesis tool-kit) etc. done all the tutorials and the same for PortAudio.  modified the tutorial files and have done very minor things with the source as a base for my own original code. but wasn't skillful enough to debug things etc.
<br />
<br />NES programming? very new in comparison to what i do with C++. no doubt about that. but i do have the programming concepts down a bit. sometimes i may just miss something simple and trivial, like the purpose of a counter in a simple loop like i did in the noob section the other day(blargg knows what i'm talking about).
<br />
<br />from the point of view of someone with my level of skill would it be useful for me to ask questions/make suggestions?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, it would actually be quite useful. Often, people who write tutorials forget that they were once new to what they are writing about. So they are really writing the tutorial understanding it themselves, not realizing that people who are newer have no clue what they're talking about. You seem to have a bit of programming experience, but not too much to see things through the eyes of a newbie. Regardless, I believe a tutorial should be written to assume no programming experience from the reader.
