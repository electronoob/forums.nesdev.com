<br />
<br />yes they are valid roms, i have used the NSRT utility on the ones that i have tried using. i've added nsrt headers, removed headers, add empty headers, all that i could, and haven't had anything go yet.
<br />
<br />i have formatted both CF cards using FAT32, since FAT16 has a read error right off the bat. i've tried it on both a FC twin and an original SNES. not sure how to tell the difference in versions, but it just says  SNS-001 on the bottom. doesn't work on either
<br />
<br />the most promise i've seen so far is that it gets to the screen that says "copying game..." then sits there til i reset it.

<br />
<br />Hi whicker, actually they're good dumps, a friend of mine tested them on his powerpak, and they go OK, i was thinking about you said of CLEAN console before to assume something.
<br />
<br />Posted my rom layering experience in case someone else have same glitches.
<br />
<br />So, the question is My SNES PPak is defective or my console is crapping it out? as you suggested.
<br />
<br />this weekend i'll get a gamebit to perform an intensive cleaning and discard some doubts.

<br />

<br />could you write down code and "made in..." at small side of CF Card?
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />btw. will there be a N64 Powerpak soon since neoflash offers a flash system?

<br />A lot of hacks have never been tested on a Super NES. Emulator results might not be fully reliable; even the author of bsnes admits that its PPU is closer to Nesticle than to Nintendulator in accuracy. Have you tried burning it on an EPROM?
