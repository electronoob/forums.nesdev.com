I'm not questioning that you know about it, just what <em>precisely</em> it is up to.<br /><br />I don't know which CPUs this leaves you with. AMD has had similar bits in their processors since 2013, and you have to go back quite far to get an Intel machine without it.<br /><br />You can sidestep almost all of these issues with a computer isolated from any networking, allowing it to communicate only over thoroughly observable I/O at the user's request. But of course, that's absolutely silly when we're talking about developing NES games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Until fairly recently, Nintendo used to require that authorized developers have a dedicated office not attached to a residence. I wonder if an air-gapped workstation used to be required. I know it's at least possible because I first tried NESdev back in 1999 with an air-gapped workstation, with an Iomega Zip drive as the only way to get files on and off the thing. I downloaded DJGPP, Allegro 3, x816, NESticle (yes, there was a time when it was the cutting-edge NES debugger), and other tools to a Zip disk on one dial-up-connected computer (a Mac), moved the drive to another computer (a 486 PC), and installed them on the other computer's HDD.<br /><br />But the root of all this was unwillingness to install (free) Wine to run (free) FCEUX for Windows because of hundreds of MB of (free) i386 libraries it would pull in.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Not quite, because you cannot do bus mastering on NES or SNES, the CPU or some part of hardware in the console must do the transaction, and that's fully under CPU control. A Bus master can do anything to the console whenever it wants. US/EU Master System (but not Mark III or JP Master System) have means to do bus mastering, technically you can make a game cart that takes bus from the CPU and runs the entire game off the cart with CPU perpetually frozen pretty much controlling all the hardware in the console as it pleases. That's partially what one game I'm working on does, it uses a small MCU to do DMAs and few other things to fully realize the VRAM bandwidth that the machine has (Z80 can only use up about 10% of what is available).<br /><br />I'm not yet familiar enough with the IOMMU mechanisms that are present in x86 world to comment more deeply, but from first glance they're primarly for OS side of things to allow virtualisation with hardware assist, with some restrictions on hardware side of things to work, aka not universal. AMD spec seems to be superior to that of Intel's, but for now I will stop digging, I don't have time to read though 500 pages of material, especially since it doesn't benefit the work I'm supposed to be doing right now lol.

To do it without harm you got to control the enable signal going to the cart so that you can disable cart on the relevant addresses and supply your own data...

The problem comes when you branch out to Game Boy, where one best of breed debugging emulator (BGB) is proprietary, and the other best of breed debugging emulator (SameBoy) is Java-trapped because it relies on parts of Cocoa (macOS API) that GNUstep hasn't replicated, such as audio.
