I have been reading all sorts of information online, seen many examples, and tested some things I've created. With all that said, what is the most commonly used compiler for NES games? I have read post about people wanting to know the best, which usually results in people just going back and forth about why they think the one they are using is better. I just want to know what the majority of the people are using. Thoughts?<br /><br />By request, I created a poll for this topic. I'm sure I am missing something, if so just leave it in a comment.

I learned on it because that's what bunnyboy's tutorial uses.<br /><br />However, once I had learned how to use cc65's linker, there was no turning back for me. There's so much power in it, not to mention the ability to use C as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I completely agree with rainwarrior. I started out with NESASM, but quickly changed to CA65. CA65 can be really difficult or confusing at first, but I got used to it very quickly. And while it seems like it is only useful for bigger projects, I never had any trouble using it for smaller ones. In fact I have only used it for smaller projects so far.<br />I have not used asm6 so I can't really say anything about it.<br /><br />This discussion comes up a lot I think and there are always good reasons to use or not to use a certain assembler. I think what it really comes down to is preference and getting used to the negative aspects of a certain assembler and learning how to work with/around them.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />NESASM and ASM6 are equally simple IMO: both can create a ROM from nothing more than a single ASM file, without configuration files or complex command lines. If you're going for simplicity, you should pick one of these 2. I prefer ASM6 because NESASM uses non-standard 6502 syntax for some things and it has been known to fail silently in the past, producing corrupt binaries without reporting any errors (some people say these bugs have been fixed).<br /><br />Even though they can assemble ROMs from single ASM files, that doesn't mean that's all they can do... you can use includes and local/temporary labels to better organize your sources, which is recommended for larger projects.

If you use an invalid addressing mode, it might pick a different addressing mode, and the overly flexible syntax means that typos can be interpreted as labels (labels don't require colons). Once or twice this has caused me some very-difficult-to-track-down issues.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; pha&nbsp; &nbsp; ; Interpreted as instruction<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; phx&nbsp; &nbsp; ; All interpreted as labels<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; phaa<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; phs<br /></div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Silent failing shouldn't ever happen I think. At the very least print a warning, an error that would force the programmer to change the code is better.<br /><br />As for WLA-DX, it does not requires semicolumns for labels, but anything that starts straight after a line is a label while instructions must have a whitespace before them. I think it's a convenient way to distinguish from labels to instructions, although semicolumns are just as convenient.<br /><br />I'd say it's a good thing that ASM6 can assemble a complex project without configuration files, and it's probably a very good reason to use it. WLA-DX requires a memory mapping file and a link file, and while this enables me to solve things (like the iNES header) in a very elegant way, it is a source of annoynace for small NROM projects.<br /><br />Another nice thing is unnamed labels. I use them all the time. The problem is that WLA-DX doesn't handle the + / - the same ways as CA65, which is what is preventing me to switch.<br /><br />In WLA dx, something like<br /><br />bpl ++<br /><br />Will branch to the next unnamed label which is called &quot;++&quot;, while on CA 65 it will mean to branch to the second next unnamed label (if I understand correctly).<br /><br />Therefore in WLA-DX it's easy you use &quot;+, -&quot; for the inner loop, &quot;++, --&quot; for the outer loop, etc.. (I rarely use more than 2 of them).<br />For CC65 it'd be a complex process to count the amount of unnamed labels you want to skip, and therefore make the code more error prone, and indirectly you'd have to use named labels instead in order to avoid errors. I HAD errors with unnamed labels on WLA, of course, but quite rarely so.
