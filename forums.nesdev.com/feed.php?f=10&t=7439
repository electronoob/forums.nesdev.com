'Globtop' is an IC package, just like DIP or any other, but cheaper (no need to form, pins, etc plus less holes and soldering points on the board). It has disadvantages, of course - lower mechanical reliablity (bending the board could disconnect chip from the board), and lack of ability to replace such parts. They are mostly black just because of nature of used material, which is probably cheapest one (no need for special colorants). Normal ICs packages are mostly black too.<br /><br />What is inside the package is different question. It could be anything, from the original chip, just differently packaged, to any clone.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Sun Jan 30, 2011 5:29 am</p><hr />

I'd like to learn about globtops and I thought this would be the best place to get some general info. Since the first time I opened up my Yobo FC game console and stared at that black glob and learned for the first time the meaning of "NOAC" I've been wanting to learn more. <br /><br />So the first basic question is what are globtops and how are they made? <br /><br />I understand they function the same as integrated circuits but beyond that I find them a mystery. <br /><br />Are there any inherent disadvantages of globtops compared to real ICs? Do they have a shorter expected lifespan? <br /><br />Might sound like a dumb question, but are all globtops black and if so, why? <br /><br />Taking a specific example, inside the Yobo FC Game Consoles' controller are two globtops. Based on what I know, I would theorize that one is a globtop version of the M4021BP control chip the NES requires and it does a good enough job that even a real NES can communicate with it. <br /><br />The other I'm less sure about, but perhaps its a globtop of the LB4969 used for the turbo fire of A B and Start? Can anyone confirm? <br /><br />Anyway, I'm grateful for any help as always. <br /><br />Edit: Oh, I just thought so something else. If some globtops such as the ones found on the Yobo controller are perfect, why is it NOACs are not? Is it possible we will one day see NOAC globtops that are as accurate in picture sound and processing speed as the real systems? I realize I'm opening a whole another can of worms with that but I'm just wondering.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4236">SatoshiMatrix</a> — Sun Jan 30, 2011 5:06 am</p><hr />
