Oddly, the misshapen maze in NES Pac-Man makes the center &quot;T&quot; shape where you start too tall.

None of the games on it are. I am not sure what hardware it is based on, but it has a TERRIBLE composite encoder and can only make 50% duty square waves. The games on here are mediocre re-writes. Dig-Dug does not play correctly at all and all semblance to the original is superficial. I have not verified proper ghost behavior in pac-man.<br /><br />The Jakks Pacific Ms. Pac-Man one, however, is extremely accurate, and seems to have custom hardware made for it with very well written ports. I say ports because a lot of the weird edge-case behaviors and bugs are present in the games. I notice this most with Mappy. There is one bug, by the way, where after opening a flashing door in Mappy one of the music channels cuts out (the second voice of the main melody) until the level ends.<br /><br />I found a pretty neato debug mode / sound test for the original Plug and Play Ms. Pac-Man unit by Jakks Pacific that showed me that it contained all the sounds to Pac-Man, even though the game was not on there! If I get my hands on one I'll try to document this.
