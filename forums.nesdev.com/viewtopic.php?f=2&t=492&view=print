		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi guys
<br />I was experimenting the other day with my new DV camcorder and it's analog to digital feature, and decided to capture some clips of me playing one of my famiclones. The video quality was very good and all, but the audio got out of sync after a while, it was going faster than the video. None of my other tests had this effect, only this one.
<br />Then I remembered reading somewhere that the NES framerate wasn't the actual 29.97 fps of the NTSC standard. Could this be the cause of the bad sync? Has anyone experienced anything like this?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, the NES video deviates from the NTSC standard. Instead of 262.5 lines per field it has 262 lines, in order to get a progressive image. (At the time the NES came out, there wasn't enough memory to make a decent interlaced image. In fact, the first major console to have "most" games interlaced was the Dreamcast.) It also has 227.333 color clock periods per scanline rather than the expected 227.5. Thus (not counting the differences between even and odd frames) the NES frame rate is 3579545.45 / 227.333 / 262 = about 60.10 FPS instead of the 59.94 that your equipment expects.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Another very minor detail is that every other frame, one single scanline (the 'dummy' before actual video rendering starts) is 2/3 of a color clock period shorter (340 NES pixel clocks instead of 341, which translates to 226.667 instead of 227.333).
<br />
<br />The exact framerate can be expressed as 1789772.7272727 / 29780.5 ([341 ticks per scanline * 262 scanlines - 1/2 tick per frame of skew] / 3 ticks per CPU cycle), or ~60.098814 frames per second.
<br />
<br />When dealing with PAL, the "every other frame is a pixel clock shorter" does not happen, so it simplifies to 1662607 / 33247.5 (341 ticks per scanline * 312 scanlines per frame / 3.2 ticks per CPU cycle), or ~50.006978 frames per second, which is much closer to standard PAL than NTSC NES video is to standard NTSC video.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hum... I see... so the video is actually a bit faster than 29.97. That makes perfect sense, as the my captured file is 29.97 fps, wich means it has been slowed down, thus, the audio is going faster. I didn't think there would be any trouble capturing videogame footage. I'll try changing the video's framerate to the values you showed and see if I can get a good sync then.
<br />Thanks for the explanation!

<br />
<br />Hey, turns out there was a difference in the duration of video and audio in the captured file, and VirtualDub (for those not used to video editing, it's a freeware video editor) sugested changing the framerate to 30.051 frames per second (60,102 fields per second) to have both tracks match their lengths... This value is pretty close to what you guys calculated, and the sync is now perfect.
<br />
<br />I could never imagine this would happen... so, in order to make a standard NTSC movie from the NES I'll have to drop frames... live and learn!

<br />
<br />How does it achieve a progressive image? The captured video looks very interlaced to me... I can see that 2 NES frames turn into 1 interlaced frame, where each NES frame becomes 1 field of the new frame.
<br />
<br />I can't say I understand much about it, so I want to ask, how does that qualify as progressive?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's progressive in the sense that it's not interlaced. Most (all?) NTSC TVs determine whether a field is even or odd by counting the scanlines of the previous field. If you output fields that all have the same number of scanlines, you trick the TV into becoming a non-interlaced 60 frames-per-second display with half the usual vertical resolution.

<br />
<br />Then how come all frames look exactly as regular interlaced ones when captured through a camcorder or a capture card of any sort? Are TVs all that sophisticated to distinguish the types of fields that are comming in and all? I thought this was a standard and period.

<br />Thats a very good idea! Messing with the audio is less noticeble than messing with video. I have never resampled audio before, though. I might be a little hard to get it right if not doing the more common procedures (PAL to NTSC, NTSC to PAL, etc), wich usually have templates for them.
