<br />
<br />Seriously...  I'm a bit drunk, but I know what I'm talking about.  I had that book recommended to me a few years back and it does help... a lot.  The hardware sections are the most useful.  Really dig into the registers.  The rest is easily learned by sifting through open source code and looking at the Wiki.  The Wiki is in poor condition and written mainly for people who wish to emulate the Nintendo, but it's sufficient aside from the confusing terminology which doesn't at all apply to practical coding application.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, we could always take some more n00bz at #nesdev EFnet if you have questions that aren't easily answered by Google. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I used to read a lot about the 6502 back when I was learning, the same things over and over, but I only really learned anything when I tried some of it out. Only then the reading started making sense.
<br />
<br />For anyone trying to understand what assembly is all about, I'd say you just can't get from reading alone. Do read the basic stuff, over and over, but also experiment a little. <a href="http://home.pacbell.net/michal_k/6502.html" class="postlink">Michal Kowalski's 6502 simulator</a> really comes in handy for that.
<br />
<br />Honestly, I never got to read a 6502 book until I was already pretty used to it, I simply couldn't find any back then. So I can say it's very much possible to learn it all with the material you find on the web and a place to experiment, but I really can't tell if a book would make things easier. The 6502 isn't really complex, as far as microprocessors go, so the only case where I can the advantage of a book over the internet is if it used very good didactics to introduce the concepts of assembly language.

There are some little things I don't fully understand, but really, once you know lda/y/x/sta/y/x, it gets really easy. If you know about programming concepts like loops and variables, it should be fairly straight forward.

<br />Eating your money when have to buy more ink as you spray it onto a page. As I understand it, if you want to read on a bus, train, or plane, it's cheaper to buy a professionally printed book than to print one using the inkjet printer that most major personal computer makers bundle with home PCs.
