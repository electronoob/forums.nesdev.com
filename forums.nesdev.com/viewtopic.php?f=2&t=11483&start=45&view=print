I would say this hypothetical game would be a one-off project and not an entry into mainstream game development.  Think of it as finding staffers who are capable and willing to fulfill the project, and receive something in return.<br /><br />For an even more ambitious example, there's this series of cross platform games, all titled &quot;Sydney Hunter&quot;, where they seem to find programmers who are specialized in their respective consoles; it will come to the NES, SNES, and even Intellivision, and they mentioned they found a Genesis programmer.  I doubt the programmers are doing it for free, and I doubt they will be forced to operate as a real development team, with crunch times or due dates or what have you.  You guys know what I'm talking about?<br /><br />Bottom line, it's all about the programmer's own will if they wish to be compensate for their specialized skills, I can't force anyone to work for me if they don't want to.  I'll be disappointed, but I'll respect their freedom.  Worst case scenario is that the game is not made.  Best case scenario is that the game is made, period.

Single Screen rooms that probably reload all objects like Battle Kid does? This does not strike me as ambitious.<br /><br />When you speak in general terms like &quot;best possible&quot;, I'm thinking of a game including all the hardest stuff to do imaginable. <div class="quotetitle">koitsu <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=113341#p113341" class="postlink">in this post</a> wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> &quot;I want to really stress the fuck out of the NES and do mid-scanline buttwiping while riding snakes, naked, around Ohio&quot;</div> kinda thing. <br /><br />Edit: I'm thinking Battletoads. Maybe it isn't obvious to the average player, but Battletoads is the most ambitious NES game that comes to mind right now. It ain't perfect, I personally don't care much for the gameplay. But I respect those programmers... there's some junk in that game I wouldn't want to code on my best day. Super Mario Bros. is pretty ambitious/impressive too, considering its lack of mapper. <br /><br />If your game isn't that, let's talk about real stuff and not hypotheticals. Design the game you want and we'll tell you what would be involved. And you can dumb down the design based on that feedback.<br /><br />If there is no such design as your first post states directly, I've probably said everything I can about a hypothetical best game. If you have something you can post that you want real, it might be more doable than you think. Also easier to find a programmer who might like your idea enough to do the spec work. (This programmer is not me.)<br /><br />But also consider what you are actually bringing to the table, as hypothetical as this situation might be. If you are paying your collaborators, you're bringing money to the table. If you're not, why should they make the game with you/share any profit with you? &quot;The idea&quot; is not the answer to this question.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The other thing worth saying is that a good design or idea for a game is worthless without a good implementation of the game itself to realize it. Every good idea for a game can be ruined by a poor (i.e. not fun) implementation. The converse is sort of true as well; if you give a bad idea to a good implementer, they will likely straighten it out and make something decent out of it.<br /><br />Games are made good not by having good ideas to start with, but by iterating on those ideas. Building something out of them, investigating what's wrong, adjusting things day by day until they start to fit together correctly. It takes time and patience, analytical skill for seeing what's not working and what it could be, and the technical skill to rebuild it better.<br /><br />Ideas are cheap. They're not hard to find, and everybody has them. Working professionally in games, I came to realize that nearly everyone who works in games has probably 5 great game ideas that they're dying to make and have been thinking about for years. If you don't have cash in hand to pay someone, I guarantee you that person already has another idea they are more interested in. (For the record, I'd gladly do NES dev for pay, but it would have to be a good enough wage to convince me to preempt my own projects.)<br /><br /><br />Another thing to know is that the time needed for a project is not in a linear scale with manpower. Some things do scale well, like music or graphics; two people will get it done nearly twice as fast, though you need a leader with direction to keep these things coherent (this is why it's only nearly twice as fast). Programming, on the other hand, does not scale very well at all this way. There are a few technical areas that can be separated and worked on in parallel (e.g. sound, rendering, tools), but almost everything a programmer does affects many parts of a complex system which means there is a lot of discussion and negotiation with other programmers involved. Two programmers might work only a little faster than one. Twenty programmers might paradoxically seem to work three times as slow as a single programmer. The reason this happens is that programming is extremely error prone, and the errors (i.e. bugs) affect everyone working on the project. A bad piece of music doesn't stop anyone else from working, but a bad line of code checked in might mean that nobody at the company can test their new work for 3 days until somebody figures out what went wrong. As you add more programmers, you increase the frequency of errors, and it accumulates almost exponentially. This is a big part of why at least 50% of commercial game projects fail and are never released.<br /><br />Movie license games are a good case example. Lots of these have a great starting idea and strong concept. In general they have a healthy budget to work with, but not very much time, and this almost inevitably turns the whole project sour. There's just not enough time to make this good idea into a good game. Working on it until it's done is not an option, and failure to release is not an option either, so the broken unplayable piece of crap goes to market anyway. This is what happens when time and scope are inflexible.<br /><br />Kickstarter has been kind of good for exposing these problems. If a publisher is paying you, when the project fails it's easy to quietly let it go; nobody knows, and you at least got paid while you worked on it, the publisher has to eat the loss. If it was a Kickstarter, thousands of people are watching you fail, and it's a rather horrible position. Not only is it awful socially, you're obligated to return Kickstarter funds, as the risk was on you the whole time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@Kasumi:  While it's hardly technically impressive, Sydney Hunter is quite 'ambitious' in that they are planning on making multiple variations of the game for different consoles.  I don't think you could say that for most homebrew efforts.  And now that you mention it, I don't think there are many, if any, homebrew games that scroll.  I've come across a post criticizing Tepple's Concentration Room for being 'yet another single screen puzzle game'.  STREEMERZ scrolls a little, which is to compensate for the original game's 320x240 screen size while the NES only has 256x224, but I can't think of many others.  Kinda funny that something as arbitrary as scrolling is a huge deal to implement, but it's also not surprising given the age of the hardware.<br /><br />And reading back at some posts that were linked in other threads, which linked to other threads, it seems like to do even the most trivial of things on the NES requires an absurd amount of work, no matter how much documentation may have been harvested in the 30 years the console existed.  Then again, older consoles were even crazier; Atari 2600 games relied almost entirely on mid-scanline writes for anything, and this continued well up to the 7800.<br /><br />When I said ambitious, I didn't explicitly mean technically sound, just very polished.  Games hardly sell themselves on something not readily visible like technical prowess, instead focusing on their visuals.  This was true when the NES was out, and this is true today.  As Rainwarrior said in this very thread, I doubt that Mario 3 would've sold more (or been more popular) if the scrolling artifacts were fixed.  I doubt people even cared the game scrolled in four directions in the first place, especially considering that there's only a few stages where you can make the camera follow you.

There <em>are</em> people who have seen my game, and every one of them thinks something is impressive that took like two seconds. I don't think anyone has told me that something that was actually hard is cool, ever. (Except Koitsu in this very topic about that text box.) <br /><br />Edit: Tepples' Variable Width Font comes to mind. He's certainly better at this than I am, but there's no way that wasn't a lot of work. And it's a thing most people won't notice unless it's pointed out to them. In fact, Tepples' whole native graphics editor with zooming is super impressive in a way that no one who doesn't do this would get. Heck even his (now removed from site) Tetris clone does things I wouldn't want to touch, personally. Tepples for <a href="http://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=President" class="postlink">President.</a> My game is ambitious in its own way, but Tepples does some crazy stuff. He's high on the list of guys a person wanting to make something like this should consider hiring before they hire me. But of course, I'm still open to making things for pay!<br /><br />Yes, there's a reason many games don't scroll. If you don't scroll, (or just scroll in one direction at a time) everything becomes much easier. Any kind of background update is &quot;the hardest thing&quot; on NES. Plan your game knowing this, if this is a thing you actually want to do. <br /><br />For a very polished game without scrolling, the answer is however long Battle Kid took. Sydney Hunter Mayan Revenge NES will no doubt take less time because that's basically the Battle Kid engine, worked on the by the guy who made Battle Kid.<br /><br />I could make a Battle Kid engine in less than a few months, for what that's worth. But an engine is not a game, and certainly not a polished one.<br /><br />Edit: No matter how you slice it, you still need details of the game to make this kind of estimate. *restate dislike for hypothetical questions and ninja vanish from the topic*  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You know, I'm kind of a different opinion on that. I don't find doing things on the NES hard, specifically. Once I had my head around all of the things it does, I find writing code for it fairly straightforward. Tedious, not difficult. The word I used before was &quot;restraint&quot;. The needs your game has will run up against limitations of the NES, and one side or the other will make sacrifices somewhere. You'll make graphical concessions, or you'll make game design concessions somewhere.<br /><br />However, I am doing this by developing the game in C++ in a framework that enforces NES rules, and then porting. So, the task that I'm saying is tedious is being a human compiler. Doing this is not something I find more difficult than other cross platform development situations I've been in. My assembly coding is not very error prone when the algorithm is already worked out in C++ beforehand. Even counting cycles is not hard when you've got a great modern debugging emulator to work with (though it can still be done reliably without, just more slowly).<br /><br />I do, on the other hand, find game development in general tremendously difficult. I've never been part of any game project that I thought was even remotely easy. Planning and building and rebuilding and iterating and making the thousand little parts of your game design work together, and finding the time, and finding the will, and finding the means. All of this is <em>hard as hell</em>, but is not in any way specific to the NES.<br /><br />I think it would be harder if I was making the game for the NES only, simply because developing algorithms and iterating over logical errors is monumentally slower when you're doing it in assembly. I've avoided this, though, by doing the hard work in an easier language, just keeping the NES rules in mind, and merely porting to the NES. If I didn't have this process, I might consider it more difficult. It wouldn't really matter if I was planning to release the PC native version or not, having the C++ as a &quot;scratch pad&quot; to do the development part has made me so much more productive that I would do it anyway. (I think Miau has talked about a similar way of doing things in the past on his blog.)<br /><br />On the other end of the spectrum, I've seen people here say that they prefer to use a hex editor to hand assemble a romhack instead of learning to use an assembler. I can't imagine trying to get anything done on the NES this way. I mean, it's technically possible to do, but I know I wouldn't have enough stamina to do anything worthwhile this way.<br /><br /><br />As for scrolling, having or not having it is an important design choice. There are things you can do with static screens that you can't do with scrolling, and vice versa. It doesn't have to be about technical feasibility. There is that aspect of it, but there are lots of consideration outside that. Scrolling isn't by itself a better game, but offers great design opportunities for certain kinds of games. Static screens do a very interesting thing with how information is revealed to or hidden to the player, for instance... Looking back all the scrolling stuff on the NES seems a fad from the era. The NES could do scrolling really well compared to its predecessors, and after a hit or two, everybody wanted to have it. We went through the same with first person shooters, et cetera.

I also like how you made the snow stop at the 'roof' instead of falling through, nice attention to detail.  And didn't the Retro City Rampage guy say that's how he was planning on making the game; program the hard stuff on PC, and then translate it to 6502?  I could've SWORN I read it on his blog, but I can't seem to find it now.<br /><br />And is he still doing NES related stuff, or did Nintendo's contract strip him of this right?  Or did his game, to paraphrase bunnyboy, turn his hobby into a paycheck?  Despite being incomplete, ROM City Rampage uses black magic compared to most NES homebrew games.  Not only is he using MMC5, not only is he using ExAtt, he can also make it scroll in all directions almost seamlessly.  I've been told that ExAtt and scrolling don't work well together, though my sources are disputable.  That said, I reckon that something like RCR would be 'the most ambitious NES game possible', which turned out to be <em>too</em> ambitious for the hardware given.  You could scale back a few things (do you really need dozens of pedestrians wandering around?) to make it work, but we don't know if it would work in the end.  I obviously won't count Shovel Knight as they broke the confines of the hardware so much, it looks like a Genesis game with an identity crisis.  Jesus, that game is a MESS with it's mishmash of colors and style.  I should mod the PC version to look more like an NES game should; I have a good idea how the NES works, I just don't know any programming.

It's certainly in no shortage of ambitiousness, but I don't think it's too ambitious for the hardware. It's a thing I've actually considered trying, just because the ROM City Rampage rom (when run outside the emulator inside Retro City Rampage) drops a lot of frames (Yes, I realize it's designed to run at only 30 FPS, but it's frequently slower than that, even). I'm curious how well I could do. I really have no doubt an open world game like that can be made on the NES (nor did he, or he'd not have started), but it's a time-payoff thing. My probably less ambitious game has taken a long time, and I can see why the time might start to not be worth it for him.<br /><br />Edit: I'm reminded of <a href="http://skullgirls.com/forums/index.php?threads/big-band-story-mode-discussion-massive-spoilers.2737/page-4#post-96866" class="postlink">this post</a> on a totally different forum.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po69zgqyFWM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po69zgqyFWM</a><!-- m --> This was ambitious.<br />And this: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://neotoxin.moccamagic.com/">http://neotoxin.moccamagic.com/</a><!-- m --><br />And this: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yAYANeSRbo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yAYANeSRbo</a><!-- m --><br />And this: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6jlek8P4Mk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6jlek8P4Mk</a><!-- m --><br />And I could swear there's some 3Dish tank game around, but I can't find it.<br /><br />I've also always found myself super impressed by this: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oMfpLiFyJE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oMfpLiFyJE</a><!-- m --> Because of behind the scenes stuff.<br /><br />Ah, and since a reply was made while writing this with just ONE game that scrolls...<br />Hiatus Ward (linked above) scrolls arbitrarily. <br />Everyone knows Super Bat Puncher which also scrolls arbitrarily: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAEl6BjnQwY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAEl6BjnQwY</a><!-- m --><br />There a game called S.T.I.N.G which you can find in the list here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nesworld.com/article.php?system=nes&amp;data=neshomebrew">http://www.nesworld.com/article.php?sys ... eshomebrew</a><!-- m --><br />This game scrolls arbitrarily: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=75399#p75399">viewtopic.php?p=75399#p75399</a><!-- l --><br />Assimilate: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nessylum.wordpress.com/">http://nessylum.wordpress.com/</a><!-- m --><br />Blade Buster: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://hlc6502.web.fc2.com/Bbuster.htm">http://hlc6502.web.fc2.com/Bbuster.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br />And many more™<br /><br />Edit3: For the record there are definitely homebrew NES games that both compete with and soundly beat commercial NES games, that are made by one person in their spare time. Edit4: In fact, proof of this is precisely what made me think you were talking something technically stupid, and not just &quot;solid game.&quot; Battle Kid 1 and 2. Blade Buster. I assumed these weren't good enough because they're certainly not hard to find, and if they exist, why ask? What you propose means you have to have money to drag these people away from their own projects, though. Or a really compelling other kind of proposal. <br /><br />We'll see what the world thinks of my game in like 20 years when it's done.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

The only problem is that the C compiler may insert calls into its runtime functions anywhere in the generated code, so you'd have to make sure the runtime routines are banked in at all times (or replace them with trampolines to banked routines, further slowing them down).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Scrolling isn't inherently hard on the NES, specially if it's only horizontal. Anyone that can understand the difference between world coordinates and screen coordinates and how they relate to each other (i.e. anyone who has programmed scrolling levels in any other platform) can do it with their eyes closed. The problem is that most newbies can only understand screen coordinates, and that makes the whole thing freakishly hard.<br /><br />Vertical scrolling, and worse yet, 4-way/8-way scrolling is significantly harder because of the height of the name tables (30 tiles - not a power of 2) which, in addition to complicating conversions between world coordinates and screen coordinates, complicates the processing of color attributes. Other consoles like the SNES, Genesis or Game Boy have tile maps that are nicer to work with, because their dimensions are powers of 2.<br /><br />This problem isn't impossible to solve if you stop for a while to think of all the math that's involved. Programmers should be somewhat good with math, because guessing is a terrible way to code for the NES. Other platforms are a bit more forgiving, and changing math in high level languages is easier than in assembly.

For example, if you decide to add a &quot;5, 4, 3, 2, 1&quot; countdown, you need to add the logic to compare the timer to those values.

Thus you can have a playfield with ExGrafix and nametable 0, and a status bar with normal graphics. You get the same artifacts at the right side as any other single-screen mirrored game, which in the case of ExGrafix doesn't have to be <em>any</em> because the seam completely fits in the windowed-off leftmost 8 pixels.
