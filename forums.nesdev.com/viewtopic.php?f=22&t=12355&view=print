For what it is, the game is pretty enjoyable, but I agree with tepples when he said that the scrolling should be fixed. I found myself getting hit because I didn't know what was to the right or left of me. I would consider moving the boundaries that stop the character from moving and start to scroll everything else closer to the center of the screen. I really like the parallax scrolling effects, like the Mega Man 2 style building and the part with the scrolling city with the raster effects and the sprites.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I love the parallax effect you used for the Game Over screen!  However, firmly believe your game is in need of much better graphics, which I cannot provide.  Maybe you could go to 4chan's /mlp/ board and ask if there are any sprite artists there, and tell them what kind of sprites you want.  I'd advise you to not tell them what the project would be like until you show them what the graphics were used for.  I mean, are you going to let generic flash games that look like NES games get the hand on you?  They will gladly do it for free if you can find a good artist.

Until He-Man, Transformers, and G.I. Joe have stupidly large and vocal fanbases, that is.
