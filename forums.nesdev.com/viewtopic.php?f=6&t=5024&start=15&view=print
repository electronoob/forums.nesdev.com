I have been doing it in a byte, but I have now changed some of the upper nybble stuff. I haven't implemented this yet. I just wanted to see if this sounds alright, or if there is something I may be forgetting in terms of the commands in the upper nybble that might be useful:

<br />
<br />I still don't have the instrument and loop stuff planned out, but I remember when I was checking out the music code for Friday the 13th, and they had used f4 as a place where the beginning of a loop is, and f5 as the point where it loops back. I was thinking maybe I could do it kinda like that. I dunno, it's on my mind to do it similarly, though.
<br />
<br />What do you think? Does this setup look alright?
<br />
<br />Oh, and Bregalad, I see why you love writing music/sound engines. It can be pretty fun, but hair pulling at times hehe

<br />
<br />Your format is extremely similar to "mine" (I'd rather say the format I use because it's not entierely mine), so it's the proof it's definitely a good format, I'm glad to see that :p
<br />The only difference is that it stats from A up to Ab, and mine starts from C, altough I have considered making it start from A in <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4432&amp;highlight=scale" class="postlink">another thread</a>, but Tepples pointed out that while the NES channels "starts" on A-1 the GB/GBC/GBA square wave channels "starts" on C-1.
<br />
<br />You don't need 16 different command bytes for looping just one is enough, you place that byte followed by the adress to loop (if you're very concerned about ROM space : place only one byte that is how much you should substract to the current adress to get to the loop point, but you can only go 256 bytes backwards).
<br />
<br />You also probably need another byte that allow you to stop the channel without looping. Looping a command on itself could make your engine crash into an infinite loop depending on how you implement it.
<br />
<br />That way you have 14 more bytes available for various commands.
<br />
<br />BTW I and Celius are now building a sound engine standard using that format, and the channels can optionally select which scale they use if that module is implemented. Altough now I'm trying to fix bugs in my SPC prototype of my engine, which is supposed to be global and multi-platform, but the SPC is a good platform to test on because powerful and flexible, and a good representation of what more modern systems are capable of.

There are lots of times where the duration, and especially the octave and instrument will remain unchanged between notes.  If you don't mind working with nybbles, you could just move on to the next nybble if the current one isn't D, E, or F.

<br />Yesterday, I implemented a conductor track into my own music engine. I use two commands: one to copy the current position to the loop point ("CON_SEGNO"), and one to copy the other way, jumping to the loop point ("CON_DALSEGNO"). (If you don't know what a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dal_Segno" class="postlink">segno</a> is, you can look it up.)

<br />3)  Don't silence the triangle by setting its period to 0.  Use the linear counter to shut it off, or if you really need it to be silent <em>NOW</em> for some reason, flip off $4015.2 (and then flip it back on right away)

<br />What Celius said above me, PLUS:
<br />
<br />Do not silence the Triangle by setting its period to 0. It does silence it, but it does so with an ugly popping noise. (Some NSF Players remove this pop to make Megaman 1 and 2 sound better).
<br />
<br />Instead, either use the linear counter, length timer, or just play with $4015 to silence it.
<br />
<br />In my experience, all of the emulators I've tried seem to allow you to pull stunts like:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDA #$0B<br />STA $4015<br />LDA #$0F<br />STA $4015</div>
<br />...in order to silence the triangle channel. Could someone please test this to see if it works on the actual hardware too?
<br />
<br />Also, disable the DMC channel if you don't use it.
<br />
<br />Make sure to write $08 to the square sweep registers if you're not using them, otherwise the squares won't be able to play really low pitches. This doesn't make a pop, but I figured it's useful knowledge anyway.
<br />
<br />Edit: Damn! Ninja'd by Disch. I need type faster. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK guys, there are a couple more things that I couldn't find definitive answers for anywhere in these forums that I hope you can shed some light on.
<br />
<br />One of them is instruments. At first I though of using specialized routines to handle each instrument, but it seems there are not that many parameters you can work with when creating them, so I imagine that defining these parameters (volume, pitch, duty cycle) in compressed lists might be better. Do you agree?
<br />
<br />Well, if I use lists of parameters to modify the note while it plays, how would I work with different durations? Should each instrument definition be divided in 4 parts (ADSR, like Disch suggested) so that A, D and R are constant but the pattern defined for S is repeated for as long as the note lasts? This is the only solution I could think of.
<br />
<br />Oh, one more thing: sound effects. We've discussed enough about how to play them, but what would be a good way to define them? Is the same format used to store music usually enough to create good sound effects, or do games use something more specialized?

<br />HEADER: 2 bytes, length and number of frames per step
<br />EACH ELEMENT: 2 bytes, duty+volume and pitch. But the way I specify pitch might not work for a platformer because it's limited to semitones.
<br />
<br />Right now, it uses a very simplistic, Game Boy-style instrument definition. Each instrument is 1 byte for duty+initial volume and 1 byte for decay rate. But I too am interested in what parameters I need to use to make it sound less Game Boy-ish.

<br />OK, but how do these lists work with notes of different durations? I mean, the lists are made for a certain number of frames, but notes with different durations take a different number of frames. How do you handle that?
