<br />Are you saying that the 2.54mm pitch connectors work for you?  I've purchased those before, and I can confirm that they do not.  Also, as pointed out above, the 0.04mm difference adds up until eventually you get a pin shorted or connected wrong.  So I have both experimental and logical evidence that these don't work - really confused as to how it could possibly function for you.
<br />Also, the board thickness is wrong on these connectors - which seems OK at first, until you rub all the copper off of your games!

<br />
<br /> I also, with the gg card edge connected, tested the continuity between each pin and the pin next to it and got no beeps. So there are no shorts with any of  the  pins and pins next to them.  Also, upon inspecting it visually and comparing it with the connector on the Retro Duo it seems to be the same connector. The pins in the connector of the Retro Duo also do not line up dead center on the cart in the same way as they do from the digi key connectors. 
<br />
<br />I also did the same experiment with the NES motherboard. 
<br />
<br />I'm moving at the moment so I had to pack up my soldering stuff before I finished actually trying it on a real NES. I'll let you know how that goes.

<br />You've done the testing thoroughly, just as I would have suggested it be done.  I just can't believe the results!  If the connectors you have from Digikey really are 2.54mm pitch, then they absolutely cannot work.  They are off by 0.04mm on every pin meaning after 30 pins (30 * 0.04 = 1.2mm) you are off by half a pitch - enough to interfere.  Not just "don't line up dead center", but short together guaranteed by geometry. Logically, a 2.54mm pitch connector cannot work.  From this, I can only see two explanations:
<br />1. The Digikey connectors are not really 2.54mm pitch.
<br />or
<br />2. You are in for a rude awakening when you try these out <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> 
<br />
<br />See my post below (from 6 years ago, yikes!) for my experience with these connectors:

<br />
<br />If you line up the pins at one end, you'd get 1.2mm error at the other. If you lined up the pins in the middle, you'd get .6mm error on one side and -.6mm on the other. That's a quarter of a pitch, which might be fine.

<br />This is why i went to a local used game shop and got a $7 copy of super mario bros to test it with <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Maybe, but it beats plugging in a $125 powerpak to test it with <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />. Actually the prices vary depending on how rare and popular they are. Some were as low as $3. But it's the only place in town I know of that has shelves full of retro games. They use to be cheaper there like 12 years ago I got a Sega CD there for $35. They want alot more for them now. 
<br />
<br />I'm confused by your confusion. We are talking about the cartridge connector on the NES itself.
