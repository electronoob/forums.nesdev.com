Good point on the scoring, I never thought about it before, but that might be an influence on some games that gave a fixed amount of points for finishing any level.  If you wanted to add another scoring challenge to the game, I'd go for a shot multiplier.  Which is increasing the points awarded until you fire a shot that misses.  You almost need an indicator for this though, to make it noticeable.<br /><br />It would be really awesome to have this on Garage Cart.  Actually here lately with all the interest shown I've been thinking about expanding it's size and scope (considering that I already have everything but the memory chips), a game like this could help ease the pain of some extra costs.<br /><br />The only criteria for being on there I'd say is that it works on both NTSC and PAL NES (should be no problem - it would be tested plenty, and can ignore speed differences), and secondly that you feel it is ready for a release.  Pretty basic.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Nov 03, 2008 7:15 pm</p><hr />

Thanks Memblers.  I didn't consider the arcade form of doing it, I just threw in the demo play because I think it's a neat feature that's easy to pull off and it's used everywhere.  I think I will split the demo into 2 portions, and they play in alternating form.<br /><br />Scoring needs a screen in the info section, currently works as follows:<br /><br />enemies killed * 100<br />fuel integer portion (what you seen on screen) * 5<br />(10 - lives game was started with) * 100<br />no shooting once in the level is a 1000 points<br /><br />You get nothing if you die before the level ends, it would've been kind of wierd that way since you can trade lives for points.  It seems kind of wrong imho.<br /><br />I can't believe I forgot about bonus lives...that would be fairly easy to do since I can just run a seperate score counter, and mod bonus_life_points.<br /><br />Also, garage cart interests me.   What type of additional criteria would this have to meet to get on there? (provided there is enough room ofcourse).  A title screen is obviously needed at this point.<br /><br />Also, I am sure I killed that bug that was annoying me earlier, it should run just fine now.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3295">smkd</a> — Mon Nov 03, 2008 12:19 am</p><hr />

After the thread about sound for this game, I figured it would be awesome, and it did not disappoint.  I have no complaints about the gameplay.<br /><br />The demo mode is pretty cool.  If it's not hard to re-order, you could arrange this into a traditional arcade "attract mode".  Show the title screen for a bit, cut to the instructions/credit screen, show a demo of a single level, repeat (showing another level).  Having other screens to show all the enemies, objects, and obstacles would be the finishing touch, maybe beyond necessary.<br /><br />I didn't quite understand the scoring system.  Because I can do a bunch of stuff, die before finishing the level, and my score is still zero.  I don't know how common of a system that it is, but I've never seen that before in an NES game.  You could also have a way to get extra lives (first at 10k, next every 100k, or something).  In a seemingly difficult game, as a player, an 'extra life' sound effect is a very encouraging thing to hear.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Nov 02, 2008 12:22 pm</p><hr />

Crap, completely forgot to read that DMC fortified joypad read thread.  I'm guessing that's where the phantom button presses are coming from.<br /><br />e: updated ROM with blarg's joypad routine for reliable reading during DPCM playback.<br /><br />@Lord Nightmare: I added something like that as part of the bonuses at level end.  Player gets extra points if they don't shoot at all during the level.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3295">smkd</a> — Fri Oct 31, 2008 7:22 am</p><hr />

This is really nice, but an annoying bug keeps popping up: the shields come on at odd moments, like when I'm not even pressing down.  I tried this again, and the shields came on when I tapped the A button... there must be some kind of joypad-reading bug.<br /><br />I'm testing this in a PowerPak on my Famicom.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=355">ccovell</a> — Fri Oct 31, 2008 7:19 am</p><hr />

when i kill enemies directly below in the second loop i descend on them with the force field on.  Otherwise you have to rotate fairly quickly all you fall and crash.<br /><br />I might fit in a congratualtory screen between the game over for that too.<br /><br />In an extremely frustrating incident, the bug in the OP is still there.  The nametables are updated per 16pixel rows, but there's a 0.05% chance or something that it will not update a given row.  I have absolutely no idea what causes this and staring at the code is not going to help me out here.  I tried to grab a tracelog, but I spent the last 2 hours save state whoring and hoping that the bug rears its head again so I can actually replay it as the bug occurs and view the steps leading up to the glitch.<br /><br />e: scratch the complaining, I just found the FCE all in one with movie recording and debugging.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3295">smkd</a> — Fri Oct 31, 2008 3:11 am</p><hr />

Okay, beat it with savestates. Second loop last level gets crazy. It's extremely hard to hit things below you ... spinning to hit them sends you in a freefall that you can't recover from. I just had to dodge the bullets for those. And those blue things require a ton of hits to kill &gt;_&lt;<br /><br />This is really cool for a hobbyist game, though extended play gives me mild subjective vertigo.<br /><br />Might I suggest a "YOU WIN" instead of "GAME OVER" for clearing both loops, though? :P<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Thu Oct 30, 2008 4:12 pm</p><hr />

@blargg: right, I originally did it just to indicate the back end of the ship, but that actually fits alot better.  Some of the detail is lost in rotation (using rotsprite from sonicretro) which I tried to add back.  I think it looks a bit better than the last one anyway.  New GFX are in the same ROM link.<br /><br />@byuu: It looks as if you're trying to pass the level without shooting anything (I can see a little bit of the turret on the bottom).  In my play throughs, I never try to cross a protected path, I always kill the enemies before advancing.  It seems too hard otherwise.<br /><br />The overall idea I'm getting is to add some easier 'buffer levels' at the beginning.  Small linear stuff with little threat to make the difficulty curve a bit more reasonable.  Level #1 can be pushed up to level #3 and I can stick some simple levels in there.  I think it would be viewed as hard because this isn't a common type of game from what I am seeing so it would initially be quite hard?.
