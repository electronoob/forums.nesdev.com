<br />I do sort them in folders, and copy them all to the CF card in sequence.  Windows does the job of writing to the card with the files in (mostly) alphabetical order, and everyone's happy.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />(I'm probably dreaming here:) I would like to see a Famicom cart version of the PowerPak much in the shape of the FDS RAM cart. With the exception that it would have a socket on top to attach the RAM cart, Game Genie style. (An adapter in this shape with a ribbon cable to a 72-pin PowerPak cart would work too, but be less elegant.) This would be dual-purpose:
<br />
<br />#1, It would be possible, to my understanding, to load FDS games in lieu of the RAM cart, with full support for added FDS hardware functionality (like the additional audio hardware). There could be a switch on the unit to simulate flipping the disk sides when prompted. This would save a good bit of wear and tear on the moving parts of an FDS. Although, it's unlikey to made I imagine, due to lack of demand and needing to make a connector that matches the FDS RAM cart/drive assembly cord.
<br />
<br />#2, It would no longer be necessary to switch the RAM cart out to play regular games, and plug it back in for use of the FDS. Less hassle, less wear and tear. Why Nintendo didn't put a cartridge slot on the FDS RAM cart is beyond me.
<br />
<br />My idea would be for the PowerPak to have priority and you would select "Boot External Cartridge" or "Boot FDS" or what have you from that menu.
<br />
<br />Probably won't ever be made. But I like the idea. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually, I was promised to get one for free after leading Bunnyboy in the right direction regarding the graphics bugs. So I can't really be that upset, just disappointed. This was at the end of June IIRC. When a lot of time had passed, I asked on #nesdev if it had been shipped, at which time Bunnyboy offered me to wait for the second-generation one instead. Again, I waited a long time, and the next time I asked on #nesdev, he said it was already shipped, but that no kind of tracking number was available because that would have been too expensive. 
<br />
<br />Since I didn't want to nag, I waited for yet another long period. I then mailed him asking about it, after which he MSG:ed me on IRC saying it had been returned as unclaimed, and asking if I had gotten a customs notice. I told him no such notice had arrived and later mailed him repeating the same thing and asking if he would consider re-shipping it. This was one week ago, and I haven't gotten any response to my mail, nor have I been able to contact him after numerous /MSG:s on #nesdev.
<br />
<br />I have tried to contact the customs office seeing if they screwed up, and according to their database, no package has been sent to my address. If it was sent as a letter instead, the post office is responsible, but they cannot check this with my name alone, some sort of posting receipt has to be available.
<br />
<br />But well, I haven't lost any money, just haven't gotten the prize I was promised to receive. So I guess there's nothing for me to cry about. Still, a promise to deliver is a promise. So if I do purchase a PowerPak, it'd have to be second-hand from someone who's a bit more responsive. Betting that a new order will show up just because there's money involved the second time seems risky.
<br />
<br />But who knows, maybe there is a good explanation for all of this...

<br />Yeah, that the swedish post serice is a joke. Once I bought something from USA and waited almost two month for it to arrive, then I called to see if they might have forgotten to tell me it had arrived. To my supprise they told me that they were just preparing to send it back to USA! O_O
<br />
<br />Another time they lost my shoes - I had a pair of shoes at my parents house that I asked if they could post for me and so they did.. but the shoes never turned up.

<br />So is the Swedish customs department. They don't even bother telling you when they snatch your stuff. They just send it back (if the sender accepts the charges) or destroy it (or keep it for themselves for all I know).
<br />
<br />Still sucks that you didn't get your powerpak though. With 20/20 hindsight you probably should've offered a couple of bucks to get it shipped with some trackable service.
<br />
<br />Mine arrived promptly, but of course the idiot mailman had just stuck the package in my mailbox even though it was too large to fit. Luckily it was still there by the time I got home.

<br />Yeah, I guess I should have, and would have if it didn't cost &gt; $40 or something. But I kind of just assumed that a tracking number would be available, so it wasn't much of an active decision on my part.
