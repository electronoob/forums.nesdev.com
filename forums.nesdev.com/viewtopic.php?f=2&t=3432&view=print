		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />After receiving my Powerpak this weekend, I decided to fire up one of my old favorite games, Ninja Gaiden.  Unfortunately, just as I remember, the game is really difficult.  So I decided to go look for GG codes so I could cheat and finally see the ending of this game.  Turns out there is only a couple of codes out there, the only useful one was "infinite lives".  So I broke out my debugger and started working on creating some new codes for this game.  I was pretty successful, and finally completed this game.  Holy cow was the last boss battle difficult.  I can't imagine how difficult it would be without cheating.  Anyway, I figured I share my codes, in case anyone else found them useful.
<br />
<br />POXVGOON: infinite health
<br />SXNYPYSA: infinite time
<br />OXVNIYSX + GVNYZYLT: infinite time and infinite magic
<br />SAVINGDA: Shuriken become Spin Slash
<br />SAVSSGXA: Windmill Shuriken become Spin Slash
<br />SANIUGEA: Fire Wheel becomes Spin Slash

<br />I can remember a couple situations;
<br />
<br />one in the second part of Stage 5 &amp; several in Stage 6. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />Timing was crucial.

<br />
<br />Sure, you needed to have good timing. But where in the game does enemies suddenly pop out of nowhere? If you run/jump far enough you can make the enemy show up before you make actually try to jump to the new place.

<br />Pretty much, for what I remember. I had trouble with that for the whole second level (that I never passed), enemies didn't stop to come from nowhere, and they often re-appeared if the screen slightly scroll, without mentionning that the "invincibility time" after getting hit is patheticly short and does not left enough time to reach a safe place.

If you jump into them you might fall to your death, but once you know where they are you can take them out pretty easily. And you can also use the spinning sword or the fire wheel of course.

<br />
<br />Here's a Nestopia v1.37 movie of the second level. It should give you some ideas as to how to go about it.

<br />Note: When you have the Jump-and-Slash, you might want to hit floating candles without wasting Spiritual Strength. To do that, you need to hold down on the control pad when you jump straight up to hit them. Otherwise, every jumping attack will cost you 5 points.

Also, the hard thing is to come with enough live left on boss battles, because you cannot start right before them.
