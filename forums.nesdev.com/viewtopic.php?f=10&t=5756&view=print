		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In case you're wondering what to do with stack memory you aren't using:
<br />
<br />Just like a lot of games reserve $0200-$02FF or $0300-$03FF for a sprite display list to be copied to OAM, my more recent efforts tend to reserve the first 160 bytes of the stack page ($0100 through $019F) for VRAM transfer buffers. The code that runs during draw time (lines 0-240) prepares data to be copied, and then the code that runs during vertical blanking (lines 241-261) blasts this to the screen with a somewhat unrolled loop that takes advantage of a convenient aspect of 6502 addressing modes: LDA $010F,X and LDA $010F,Y are as fast as LDA $010F as long as they don't wrap. So I make a routine that copies 32 bytes starting at $0100+Y and call it with different starting addresses in Y, and the same routine can efficiently update a row of nametable entries, two tiles in CHR RAM, or the palette.

<br />
<br />Another thing I often have in page 1 is the copy of the attribute tables (128 bytes), something some times of projects benefit from (scrollers where you need to read-modify-write attribute bytes, for example).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My original question was provoked because I was jumping directly to some bankswitching code in my fixed bank, paying no attention to the calls that eventually got to that jump. The result was that on a game state change, the stack would start at a different location. I have since modified this system so I don't directly jump to the bankswitching code, and this change preserves the stack. So now, I'm free to use the lower portions of the stack page if I need it. Even if I don't need it, it still feels cleaner this way. Leaving addresses on the stack, even if it worked by coincidence, just felt dirty =)

<br />Or the upper parts, if you initialize the stack pointer to something lower than $FF. Personally I'd only use the lower or the upper part of page 1, not both with the stack in the middle, because that could be confusing! =)
<br />
<br />I mentioned this because sometimes it matters where the data is. I have used a trick before where you access a table using a lower base address than the actual address (lda Table-$80, x or something like this) so that the value of the index was more convenient for some of the math involved. So I needed the table to be on the upper part of page so that there was no page crossing while reading from it.

But the game was released like that until I fixed it, it always ran just just fine.  The stack page looked hilarious in a memory viewer though.
