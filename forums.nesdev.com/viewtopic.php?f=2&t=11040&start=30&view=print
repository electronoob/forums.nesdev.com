		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The &quot;Real time slow-motion&quot; thing was supposed to be a nod to those blurbs that were on some NES boxes.  Granted most BS blurbs started to become less common with the NES and they were common for 2nd gen games.  But I still have a different way for how &quot;bullet time&quot; could be executed.  Let's take my prior theory of a game that doesn't slow down, whether it's been optimized to hell and back or if there's next to nothing happening on screen.  Would it be possible to intentionally cause slowdown on the NES, after pressing a certain button combination?

The amount of slow down is basically proportional of the # of options you have.<br /><br />No option = 60fps<br />One option = 30fps<br />Two options = 20fps<br />Three options = 15fps<br /><br />Additionally, it will randomly go suddently much faster or much slower. Constant slowdown is not lagging anymore it's a ***** mess.<br /><br />Fortunately the SNES version is much better.

That would be the easiest thing to do. Just a series of nops and using one of the registers as a counter. Not sure why you'd want to do that but I guess there are some difficult games that having a slowdown button would be helpful for. Maybe Silver Surfer?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Somewhat related question I've been meaning to ask, since I couldn't understand the wording.  According to tepples, the NES' CPU does twice as much in each cycle as the SMS' CPU, and mentioned that a 1.8 MHz NES and a 3.6 MHz SMS is &quot;a wash&quot;.  Does that mean they both have roughly the same computational power?  And how does the SMS fare with slowdown?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm pretty sure slowdown works the exact same way on the SMS: if one frame isn't enough time for all the computations, graphic updates will be delayed until the next VBlank. It's true that, unlike the NES, the SMS can update the graphics while the screen is rendering, only not as fast as during VBlank, so I believe most programmers wouldn't go through the trouble of slowing down the updates just to be able to do them before the next VBlank, not to mention the visible tearing that would result from doing that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For a game that's developed for hardware that's known in advance, slowdown is more of a software design and implementation problem than a hardware problem. It occurs where what the developer has attempted to make their game do exceeds their hardware's performance budget.<br /><br />If you stay under the performance budget when designing/implementing your game, there will be no slowdown. It doesn't matter if the budget was larger or smaller, only whether you met the budget. Thus, slowdown was not really the hardware's fault, merely the developers trying to exceed its capability. Trying to compare SMS vs NES in terms of which system had more slowdown is futile, you are merely comparing how developers felt about their performance budgets.<br /><br />It's a different story on a PC where the developer has no idea how powerful your CPU or GPU is ahead of time (aside from telling you some minimum or suggested requirement). In this case the developer has to allow for this, which is why on PC games you tend to get a variable framerate implementation rather than console-style slowdown. You also tend to get a lot of options for things like level of graphics detail, allowing the user to scale back the performance budget to meet their hardware's capabilities, so that the user can choose whether to favour framerate or detail.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree. You need to stop thinking about NES or SMS hardware as being somehow at fault or to blame in relation to slowdowns. Slowdowns are because the game is programmed in a way that situations where too much needs to be processed for a single frame occur. It doesn't matter how many sprites or enemies are on the screen, it matters how much CPU time is needed to keep having frame updates ready in time. How many enemies or objects are on screen certainly play a part, but the amount of CPU time each piece needs can vary greatly from game to game or even situation in the same game. <br /><br />There really is no mystery behind slowdowns in general. Too much to compute each frame. A good example of some bad programming causing slowdown is Mega Man The Wily Wars on the Genesis. You'd think since the original game on a 6502 at 1.78mhz had very little slowdown that on a newer 68000 at 7.5mhz would have perhaps none at all right? Well just playing against CutMan in the first game, it slows down immediately as the battle starts. It runs slow the whole time. However if you have Gutsman's power you can throw the two blocks in the room and the slowdown goes away as I recall. So somehow those two blocks just being there somehow caused the framerate to drop below 60fps. <br /><br />I've read various comments, some saying the game was programmed in C rather than ASM leading to inefficient code. We can be sure that something is being wasteful though given that the game logic certainly didn't have a problem before.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Final Fantasy V on the GBA shows quite a bit of slowdown in some things that the original game had no problems with at all.  Even accounting for CPU time lost for soft synth, the GBA's cpu mops the floor with the SNES's cpu.<br /><br />So yeah, you get what you get, I suppose.  I know I've seen the following sorts of things in GBA code:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; r0 is being used as a counter for an inner loop of some sort<br />add r0, r0, #1<br />lsl r0, r0, #16<br />asr r0, r0, #16<br />cmp r0, #looptotal<br /></div><br /><br />So the code was written in C, and used the short datatype instead of the int data type for an inner loop variable, which just indicates lack of familiarity with the CPU (and C in general, because you should always use int for operations where no specific size is needed).<br /><br />I'm sure NES code comes across the same thing; I remember reading in Disch's disassembly of Final Fantasy that some of the code uses zero page addresses without zero page addressing.

I don't know if it was human error or a crappy assembler or what. Obviously you want good performance but at the end of the day a product that works is the end goal. Ofcourse there's action 52 which doesn't even seem to meet that basic goal.

That incidentally is the kind of question that inspired the great C64/Speccy flamewars on Usenet. But I will say something about the video chip: the fact that the Z80 in the SMS can write to VRAM during draw time is probably balanced out by the lack of hardware horizontal sprite flipping.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">natt wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I remember reading in Disch's disassembly of Final Fantasy that some of the code uses zero page addresses without zero page addressing.</div><br />Assuming it's not <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">LDA a,Y</tt>, which has no zero page counterpart: NESASM is descended from MagicKit, but is that descended from an NES-era assembler?
