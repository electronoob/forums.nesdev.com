		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm back on the task of making a real-NES text viewer, without any special accommodation for faulty emulators built into DVD players (sorry francois) and without screen rotation (because among Nintendo hardware, only the VS Unisystem has the capability of rotating the screen, and that's too rare). But I'm having a little trouble optimizing the rendering code. Even when I shift glyph patterns with an unrolled loop based on Duff's device, I can't always get one 56-character line of text to render in one frame, and that's a hard thing to deal with if I have to use sprite 0 for bankswitching. Is anybody interested in looking at my code to see what's going wrong?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had a go at the code and made a lot of changes (and enjoyed using ca65). Here it is, including a ROM built from it:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.io.com/~greens/temp/blargg_vwf_003.zip" class="postlink">blargg_vwf_003.zip</a>
<br />
<br />I sped the glyph rendering up somewhat. The original's image appeared after 29 frames, and after my changes it appeared after 21 frames, so it's at least 28% faster. I was hoping for more speed, but the bit shifting really costs a lot. I ended up writing 8 separate render loops for each of the bit alignments. I was able to come up with lots of bit shifting tricks to make most of them pretty quick. One difference is that is clears to the right of a glyph, so you can't draw text from right-to-left, for example. This simplified the code and eliminated the need to clear the entire line in advance.
<br />
<br />After that worked, I switched to using the sprite overflow flag ($2002.5) instead of sprite #0 hit, allowing removal of the borders. Then I put the sprite overflow polling loop in an IRQ handler and had it fire mid-screen using the DMC. With these changes, display is all being done via interrupts, allowing the mainline code to do anything without having to manage the pattern switch mid-screen.
<br />
<br />I added a flag to have the NMI routine blit a line of text/graphics to the screen during vblank and changed the text rendering to draw the lines as they are complete, so you see them appear one at a time on screen. One line appears per frame, so the bottleneck there is vblank time (though I guess you could end the frame early to get more vram access time).
<br />
<br />I couldn't help changing the code style a bit and putting the bitmap screen handling in a separate module, since it's logically distinct from the variable-width font rendering. You could use the bitmap screen module to do graphics or text using your own font routines. Also you can specify the foreground and background colors in X and Y when initializing the bitmap screen.
<br />
<br />I tested it on my NES to get the overflow flag timing fine-tuned. I hope this new sprite overflow timing is used instead of sprite #0 hit, because it would finally justify enabling sprite overflow calculation in my emulator (Bee 52 is the only thing I've found to use it). In any case, use whatever of my changes you like and toss the rest. The changes are orthogonal so you should be able to pick and choose without mich difficulty.

<br />
<br />How fine-tuned?
<br />
<br />It works in my emu... I have the sprite overflow flag set up to be as described on the wiki.  If it is off by one or two cycles, would the display distort?  or is it more of a loose timing mechanism just so you can get around the right area?
<br />
<br />I'm glad to see something finally testing the overflow flag.  I wasn't sure my implimentation was working because I didn't really have anything to test it on (I don't think Bee52 really strains it that much).  Seeing this working was kind of a load off =)
<br />
<br />Very impressive, btw

<br />
<br />Probably not very fine-tuned because I made a quick fix just after I posted it that made it much less critical. I'll have to write a test ROM for sprite overflow sometime (including the crazy behavior documented on the wiki). Start a new thread if you want to discuss it further or encourage me to write a test.

<br />
<br />You could always switch back to the sprite #0 hit and poll for that in the IRQ handler, if sprite max isn't handled properly by common emulators. I put 9 sprites in a row to be sure it wasn't relying on the pathological behavior when the sprite after the 8th doesn't trip the overflow. Surely Nestopia handles the sprite overflow flag properly.
<br />
<br />I forgot to mention that I flipped the source font data vertically to allow using a decrementing index to save 2*8 clocks for each glyph rendered.
<br />
<br />I'm now writing some scripts so I can use ca65 as easily as my other assembler (hit F4 to run source from current window on NES). If only I could find the cause of the :+ feature being broken (I fixed some problem with I think :- a while back on my source tree).
