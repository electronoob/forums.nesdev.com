Could I do it? And if so.... how?<br /><br />I've been trying to look everywhere, but there is surprisingly really small results  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> . I kinda understand about how you could use C to make the games, but what about C+? You can't program 3D games with C. I know about the IceQuake (or whatever it is) website, but I actually find it not really good. What software do I use? Is there any compiler that can work for the N64? What model/sprite maker/editor could work? Is there any upcoming projects that will make N64 development more easier and more specific (Like the PyNES, or other development tools), and finally: Is there any SDK dedicated to this kind of topic?<br /><br />This sounds like a lot, but the N64 Homebrew Scene is totally empty. Why can't this amazing system get as much respect as the Playstation, Dreamcast, or even the Saturn? It's unfair and honestly makes no sense (especially considering how technology has come over the years). I kinda understand the cartridge deal (though someone could probably replicate the CIC and maybe make PCB's for the N64) and I actually found out about the music deal (thanks to Marshall's website plus other websites and programs). Can someone help me and guide me through the development cycle, so every Nintendo console will have equal homebrew success? Thank You. <br /><br />P.S. I'm not really trying to be the hero of it all (knowing that Marshall is a god at this), but I just really want to know badly. Thank You (Again)

Developing a new game for the N64 isn't impossible, but without the (illegal) Nintendo SDK, it's very difficult.<br /><br />There's been a bit of more recent progress, though: <a href="http://www.dragonminded.com/n64dev/" class="postlink">take a look at this</a>. If you want to do some N64dev, that's not a bad starting point. (The other option is to compile your own MIPS GCC and figure out the rest of the toolchain yourself.)

Like people said, C can certainly be used to make 3D games. The language you use has absolutely no relation with the kinds of graphics you're generating. As long as you can command the video hardware, you can have it generate any graphics it's capable of.
