However there is many disadvantages in doing so, but regardless, it's perfectly possible.<br /><br />If you use a mapper that relies on a CPU cycle timer like Konami VRCs mapper, FME-7 or the Famicom Disk System it'll be relatively easy, otherwise it'll be a headache to get working.

But you have to find a way get the time exactly right every frame, or it will look &quot;jumpy&quot;, and since rendering is off you can't use sprite 0 to help you with the timing... it will have to be pure cycle counting (or a mapper that does the cycle counting for you - scanline counters won't work, because they also need rendering to work). Also, if you make use of $2006/$2007 past the end of VBlank, you'll need to set the scroll with <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=64111#p64111" class="postlink">combined $2005/$2006 writes</a>, instead of the usual $2005/$2000 writes.

And honestly ~20 extra lines may be good enough.  I think that rather than try to start rendering late, I'd use a split-screen technique - manipulate the scroll values to show the bottom black bar again.  Perhaps we can show a black bar from the other nametable - and us it as a place to show text - though text is a thing we're thinking of abandoning since our CHR ROM is so precious (though I have a mind to beg mham to upgrade us to UxROM, but we're trying to see how far we can get with NROM)

Are you changing the design of your game? Anyway, you can still use vertical scrolling as long as you can guarantee that non-transparent pixels in sprite 0 will overlap non-transparent pixels in the background every frame.

You will not be able to use that time for extra VRAM transfers, of course, since rendering will still be enabled.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Sounds like the bottom black bar, aka early vblank, is the easy part.</div><br />Quite the opposite! Disabling rendering early can introduce the sprite glitches we talked about, and it's harder to synchronize with PPU after your game logic (needs sprite 0 hit or mapper IRQ). Blanking scanlines at the top of the screen is easier, because you have 2 possible sync points nearby (start and end of VBlank), so all you need is a bit of timed code to enable rendering at the correct scanline.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I think that rather than try to start rendering late, I'd use a split-screen technique - manipulate the scroll values to show the bottom black bar again.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No, not changing the design of the game... just how the map is broken up.  We have decided to create a top-down adventure.  We are bouncing lots of ideas around at the moment so really it's going to be somewhat of a compromise between design and technical power.  We are working hard on the R&amp;D side of things to push the conventional boundary of what the NES is thought of being capable of.  Well, really, just me.  I'm an obsessive perfectionist.<br /><br />The main reason for wanting to have more VBLANK right now is this <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://slack.net/~ant/misc/nes-saw/">http://slack.net/~ant/misc/nes-saw/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I want to use this trick to add an extra voice during non-interactive moments.  But we also want to do time-of-day palette updates.  The combo makes me think that the CPU will be taxed because of the IRQ so having more time to update the palette will help avoid glitches.  Alternatively I've been thinking about using the IRQ to do more frequent music updates (better time resolution so more freedom with tempo).   Maybe one or the other depending on the context.<br /><br />As for which mirroring mode we'll use ... right now I'm not sure but we know that the map will be divided into &quot;rooms&quot; much like Zelda (rooms is just a term ... it may be mainly an outdoor overworld.)  I was going to use vertical scrolling to create &quot;big&quot; rooms but Mike brought up horizontal scrolling &quot;corridors&quot; (like Metroid or Goonies) and I might like that better, but we'd have to rework the map format (which is just in the sketching stage).  Or we might have no scrolling at all.  But I think that having some scrolling would add more impact.

With horizontal scrolling it's much easier to provide a straight solid line.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">This, and I'd also say that extra VBlank is overrated in general. Not that it'd bad, but it's just not that good. Normal VBlank is enough for most applications, really.</div><br />Yeah, if you optimize the shit out of the code that writes data to VRAM you can do a lot in the standard 20 or so scanlines of VBlank. You can easily scroll in both directions at once while also updating the sprites and the palettes, which is enough for most games. What complicates things a bit are pattern animations... those can really eat a lot of your VBlank time, and is the only real excuse I can think of to need extra VBlank time.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">sonder wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But we also want to do time-of-day palette updates.</div><br />Palette updates are ridiculously quick if you pre-calculate all the data (as should be done with EVERY piece of data you write to VRAM). If you use code similar to this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;set up the destination address (12 cycles)<br />lda #$3f<br />sta $2006<br />lda #$00<br />sta $2006<br /><br />;prepare to reuse the background color (3 or 4 cycles)<br />ldx BackgroundColor<br /><br />;write the first palette (25 or 28)<br />stx $2007<br />lda Palette0Color1<br />sta $2007<br />lda Palette0Color2<br />sta $2007<br />lda Palette0Color3<br />sta $2007<br /><br />;now write the remaining 7 palettes in the same way...</div><br />It will take only 240 (colors loaded with absolute addressing) or 215 (colors loaded with ZP addressing) cycles to update all the colors... that's about 10% of the regular VBlank time, there's still enough time to update many other things. If your game is screen-by-screen, you definitely don't need any extra VBlank time unless you're animating several tiles in the pattern tables (which can't be the case since you're using CHR-ROM).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Or we might have no scrolling at all.  But I think that having some scrolling would add more impact.</div><br />No scrolling definitely helps with blanking portions of the screen. If you're only using scroll for &quot;impact&quot;, quickly scrolling from one room to the next rather than smoothly following the player, I suggest you either drop the scrolling or do a very controlled/scripted one (like the vertical scroll in Mega Man 1, that does something purely visual before returning control to the horizontal scrolling engine) that won't get in the way of your letterboxing scheme.

But if all tables / unrolled loops would take a mere 10% then maybe it won't be so necessary to get extra vblank.  I just figure that having a smaller viewport for the playfield is a decent price to pay just to have a little more technical freedom, and it could as a side effect give the game a more cinematic feel.  Where can I read about the topic of extending vblank in more detail?

It would have to be used strictly to disable rendering at the bottom of the frame, right?  So no splitscreen without scanline hardware of some kind, or tricky-as-hell cycle counting, right?<br /><br />How does Battletoads know when to re-enable rendering at the right scanline?  Scanline hardware?<br /><br />Everyone keeps mentioning $2006 writes for setting up the scroll.  How does that work?  But it only matters if rendering hasn't been enabled by the &quot;first&quot; scanline (the pre-render scanline as you referred to it).  If it's not a big deal to do the scroll through $2006 then that's not a detractor.<br /><br />I still don't have a clear idea of what it will take to accomplish this in say, an NROM game.  People say cycle counting but it seems to me like I could easily disable rendering at line 200 on sprite 0 hit and just make sure to re-enable it after my vblank routine.  Anyone please confirm if my thinking's right on this or not though.
