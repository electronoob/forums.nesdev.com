<br />
<br />How many mappers can you use?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay. First, there is only one stack, from $100-$1FF. RAM ranges from $0-$7FF. $100 bytes are used for the stack, which holds the adresses when you do a JSR. The stack is usually something you want to stay away from, if you're just saving bytes. Zero Page can be used for many things, like jumping to an address depending on the values in Zero Page. Zero Page is the RAM ranging from $0-$100, if you don't know. And $100 bytes somewhere else are almost always used for sprites. 
<br />
<br />And you say something about different "mappers"? You mean like game maps, or like mappers, like MMC1 and stuff? Because there can only be 1 mapper per game. And You just save stuff like how many potions you have and stuff in RAM/SRAM. Zelda has SRAM which is RAM ranging from $6000-$7FFF that is backed up by a battery, so when you shut the game off, it will be saved. Does that help at all?

<br />
<br />Also how can i move from screen to screen, meaning nametables to nametables?  I want to be able to use the save function to access the saved parameters on another screen.
<br />
<br />I had always though of mappers as a section of your code that does one thing like playing level one and then when yhour done with that level it maps to level two with a whole differnet set of parameters, nametables, palettes, etc....
<br />ie,  Super mario Brothers 3 when your done defeating one level   another level is opened up, but eventually when you beat all the levels in the world you can move up and down to access what ever level you want in the world.
<br />
<br />Do mappers do this?  What can do this?

I really don't know what Rod Zacky is talking about. Maybe you missunderstood him somehow? No offense, but you don't seem to know what these terms (stack, mapper and register) mean.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also how can i move from screen to screen, meaning nametables to nametables?

<br />Memory contents are by no means attached to a screen. The program you make controls the memory, as well as the screen. It can change one, the other, both or none of them, depending on what you code.
<br />
<br />When you say "move from screen to screen", do you mean scrolling? If yes, don't worry about that yet. If you just mean "change the screen contents with no animation", then you could just draw the new contents to the other name table (the one not beeing displayed) during VBlank and when you are over, set it as the displayed one. Or you could turn rendering off, draw over the same screen and turn rendering on again.

<br />The only thing a mapper would have to do with this is that some games may store one level's map or a few levels' maps in each PRG bank, and whenever the program wants to read the data for a given level, it will switch to the PRG bank containing the data for that level. Or if a game uses CHR ROM, each level's unique tiles will be stored in a separate CHR bank.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Don't bite off more than you can chew.  Before you worry about mappers and scrolling, I suggest you make some stationary demos.  You still have a lot of the basics to learn before you'll be able to really take advantage of mappers and have a scrolling screen.
<br />
<br />It is possible to change the stack pointer (using TXS, TSX) to split up your stack into two of more smaller stacks, but that's sort of a pain.
<br />
<br />You can also simulate a stack on your own without using the actual 6502 stack:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">somecode:<br />&nbsp; lda #$20<br />&nbsp; jsr push_a&nbsp; &nbsp;; push a to simulated stack<br />&nbsp; lda #$10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; change a<br />&nbsp; jsr pull_a&nbsp; &nbsp; ; pull a back from stack<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; A is now $20 again<br />&nbsp; rts<br /><br />push_a:<br />&nbsp; ldx stack_pointer&nbsp; &nbsp;; keep the stack pointer in RAM somewhere<br />&nbsp; sta stack,x<br />&nbsp; dec stack_pointer<br />&nbsp; rts<br /><br />pull_a:<br />&nbsp; inc stack_pointer<br />&nbsp; ldx stack_pointer<br />&nbsp; lda stack,x<br />&nbsp; rts<br /></div>
<br />
<br />
<br />But I doubt you'd have much use for this in your program.
<br />
<br />
<br />Mappers are nothing like what you describe.  Games change their nametables and pattern tables by updating the PPU with new info (writing to $2007).  It has nothing to do with the mapper used.

<br />im guessing if its not mappers that do this than it is done with a jmp routine wiht a whole differnt set of nametables and paltetes..etc?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />On the NES at least, there is only 1 stack. You are asking little questions that take a lot of time to explain. Like Scrolling from one name table to another is up to you about how you want to scroll, all I can tell you is that you store the scroll by writing to $2005 twice. So If I wrote this:
<br />
<br />lda #2
<br />sta $2005
<br />lda #6
<br />sta $2005
<br />
<br />The picture on screen would be two pixels down, and 6 over from the corner pixel on the nametable. And There are 4 nametables, 2x2 screens. So you'll have to update them as you go, which can be a pain. These are things that can't just be explained simply. I don't know how to explain all this without taking up a whole page. 
<br />
<br />I'm sorry, but you should understand the 6502 completely before you are asking these questions. If you go to the main page, you can find "Assembly in one step", which is really good. I made the mistake of trying to program the NES without knowing the 6502, and it was not a good plan. I was asking all sorts of questions like this, making a thread be like 4 or 5 pages. If I would have understood the 6502, I probably would have had those threads be like 1 or 2 pages, and have like half the threads even present. I know you probably hate to hear it, but you should really do that. Read 6502 documents till you completely understand everything. 
<br />
<br />I mean, make tech demos for the NES and practice using the 6502, but do not by any means try and make a game without knowing the language. When I wanted to program the NES last year, I didn't even know what a byte, or bit was. And I didn't know that you could make NES games. So, learning the 6502 can't be that hard, if you are starting out on a higher level than that. And when I first saw the JMP command, I thought it was like Jump, and in mario jumps. Like, the make mario jump command. I laugh looking back thinking how far I've come. I'm rambling, I'll stop.

<br />Sprites and background are just graphical aspects of a program. The NES does not know what a button is, wich means you'll have to program one. Since you're in charge, you can build a button out of whatever you want. As long as you respect the hardware's limits, of course (no more than 8 sprites on a scanline, for example).
<br />
<br />Just drop the idea that these things (sprites, mapper, name tables) are actually attached to any object concepts. A game is just an illusion, created by clever handling of the system's graphical features. Logic manipulates the graphics to simulate something. A sprite, from the programmers point of view, is not a character, an item or an object, it's a 8x8 pixels square (or 8x16 pixels rectangle) that overlaps the background. These can be used for many things, including representing characters, items and objects, but only because the programmer made that happen.
