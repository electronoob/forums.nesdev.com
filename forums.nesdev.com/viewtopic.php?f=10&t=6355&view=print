<br />
<br />I'm trying to make my first NES program which writes hello world to the screen, but it writes 'hello wor' then stops. I understand there's an 8 tiles per row limit, so how do I get it to write the full text?

<br />So how do I add background tiles? Is it something to do with nametables? And if it is, isn't that sort of wasting space? A whole nametable for 'hello world'? I plan to advance the program into a simple game of some sorts when I'm ready.

<br />I'm really sorry to say it that "harsh" way but it seems you definitely need to read more about how the NES works (nametables, pattern tables, etc...) before posting here. Also this should have been posted to "Newbie" section.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sprites are typically used to draw things that move around, such as the main character of a game. Since you can't put more than 8 of them side by side (like you observed), they are not suitable for writing text. The name tables should be used for that.
<br />
<br />The name tables are used to draw the background. They are grids of 32x30 tiles, the size of the NES screen. To draw tiles to the background you simply write to that grid the index of the tiles you want to display.
<br />
<br />Of course you'll have to worry about some details such as making sure that the name table you wrote to is the one being displayed (PPU register $2000 is used to select which name table is visible) and that this name table is aligned as you want (use the scroll register, $2005). To make sure the colors are correct you must also fill the corresponding attribute table accordingly.
<br />
<br />I'm guessing you learned how to draw sprites with a tutorial, is that correct? There are tutorials for the background too, so that's what you should be looking for in order to write text.

That's the "canvas" you have, if you only have a few things to "paint" it with, there will be blank space. It's not a waste because once you are done with that screen you can simply redraw over it, just like when you perform a search on Google and the next screen is filled with results and much less white space.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I plan to advance the program into a simple game of some sorts when I'm ready.</div>
<br />No problem. Writing "hello world" to the name tables does not invalidate your program turning into a game by any means.

<br />I think I understand this now:
<br />
<br />I think I can write an arbitrary amount of data that represents some tile indexes in my CHR file to nametable memory and it gets displayed on the screen? I've read before that it has to be a fixed size so this is why I've been confused about this bit.
<br />
<br />I'll post back later with a screenshot if I manage to get this right lol

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It does have to be a fixed size, you can't write more than is possible to fit on the two nametables you have access to.
<br />
<br />But what is even more limited is the sprite system, which is what you were running into.  Despite being able to use 64 sprites total, you can only have 8 sprites per horizontal scan line.  Programmers get around this by alternating which sprite is shown on each screen refresh.  So for example, on the first frame you'd display "HELLO WOR  " and on the next you would have "  LLO WORLD".
<br />
<br />So that's an alternative to using the nametables...except that you really should get used to using them for text, that's essentially how you need to learn to do it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
