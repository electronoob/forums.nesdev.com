This would also allow the approach of using a completely different method of rendering, such as the 2.5D idea I mentioned. I'm not even sure how much more work it would be to do something like this as opposed to a generic &quot;high-res tile&quot; approach, although the latter would be easier for non-programmers to implement (but also more limited). For example, I'd love to see a SMB emulator that renders the graphics in the style of NSMB, but running the original game logic so all the known bugs would still be present (hat stomp, mushroom jump, wall anti-ejection, world 36). This would also present an interesting situation where existing TAS movies could be replayed on such an emulator to present a new and fresh look to something that is already very entertaining from a gameplay perspective.</div><br /><br />I too have thought about this idea from time to time... but while it is an intriguing concept, both the effort involved and possible support it would gain make me question the success it might have. The main problem is the fact that you already mention: that the best possible approach is game specific. What we are really talking here is not really extending an emulator with some extra functions, but more about putting an emulator inside a highly flexible game engine having support for high-level scripting and all sorts of 3d content management. A creative artist retracing blocky graphics to bigger resolution sis a fairly simple task, but for this you would need a programmer with the knowledge, time and motivation to reverse engineer the NES *and* 3d graphics artists that can provide him/her with content for the sophisticated 3d engine.<br /><br />I'm not saying it can't be done... but if anyone feels up to the task, I really think that the NES emulation part will be the very *least* of the troubles, so with all respect I kind of doubt this is the right forum to gather support for such a project. Better look around in general game programming forums for people who'd fancy doing truthful HD remakes of NES games. <br /><br />Also, I'd say a multi-emulator system such as MESS would be a more likely candidate to shove into a modern 3d engine than any of the NES emulators discussed earlier, since that would give a bigger target audience and really, emulating the hardware perfectly is by definition not necessary. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Having tiles 2x in size would really make it easier to make amazing looking edited sprites.<br /><br />Possible? what do you guys think?

It's amazing.<br /><br />I keep hacking Master System games to high definition (like <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://youtu.be/XrqNfv3qiHA">http://youtu.be/XrqNfv3qiHA</a><!-- m --> and <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeegmIt03nM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeegmIt03nM</a><!-- m --> ) mostly because there's no (easy) way to do it to NES titles.
