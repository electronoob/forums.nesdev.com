		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The middle bar looks a lot as if it were related to refresh. Btw. I think byuu mentioned that very old SNES consoles did do the refresh at a constant location in the middle of the scanline (and newer consoles somewhat 'randomly' at middle +/- some clock cycles). I am wondering if that old consoles did suffer from even worse bars?<br />If yes, then Nintendo has maybe invoked the non-constant refresh timing in order to make the effect less annoying.<br /><br />Bars on the right side might be due to the &quot;hblank&quot; period, the PPU should be fetching VRAM data a bit in advance, so it can enter the &quot;hblank&quot; period at a time when it is still drawing the last some pixels of the scanline.<br />During that time, HDMA processing may cause some extra noise, and paused BG-fetching may also cause some different noise.<br /><br />I've no idea what could cause bars on left side. Unless the CPU executes opcodes in sync with scanline drawing (like always returning from hblank interrupts, at the begin of a scanline... but, such patterns should vary from game to game).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I still have that hunch that the actual visible appearance itself is caused by a voltage supply problem to the Q3, Q5, and Q7 transistors because of the long route Vcc has to take to get to them, ending up going from topside to bottom through a single VIA after passing by the WRAM chip and such. This is on a SHVC-CPU-01 board, so I can't vouch for the newer ones.<br /><br /><br />But yeah, it's probably best to confirm that refresh is the culprit in that large bar in the middle.<br /><br /><br />Regarding ground bounce... one could try lifting off one side of C68 and C69 to get rid of the two clocks coupling their higher frequency components into the nearby ground (and instead into the air, heh).<br /><br />I'd really like to try some of this stuff but I don't have any kind of setup that produces really apparent bars.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I haven't followed all this fully, but I thought I'd ask is it possible to just replace the DRAM (I assume) with regular static ram? The refresh periods still need to happen, but with no DRAM to refresh perhaps the power spike won't cause the visible issue anymore? Just a random thought I wanted to add.

You'd need to make some circuit that reproduces the dual address bus, and sequential access counter.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just reduced the bar by AT LEAST 75% just by adding a Big ass Capacitor right across the regulator output.<br /><br />Im sorry if this has been established before, and it probably was, I apologize I did not read the whole thread but I just noticed that. And thought this was one heck of a dirty easy fix. <br /><br />So whatever causes the bar transmits it at least in good part through the 5v rail. <br /><br />I used a 4700 uf @10v ( huge can ), basically the largest capacitance cap I had on hand, and just soldered it there on the regulator.
