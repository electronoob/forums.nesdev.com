But to be realistic that is also not true as Counter-Strike is still in the top 3 most played steam games even after more than 10 years. While I agree millions will have moved on, there are still 100's playing old games like CS, TFC and so forth.

The controllers were known for wearing out, even though Nintendo had tested them and rated them for over a million button presses.  Testing is by no means a silver bullet.<br /><br />Same thing goes for software.  Putting things out in the wild is a waaay different beast than any other sort of testing environment.<br /><br />These companies have budgets, deadlines, suppliers, and shareholders.  Consoles go through countless revisions, even with small things that most people don't notice, never mind massive changes with form factor or display.<br /><br />And to top it off, these items are DEEP into the discretionary category of purchases.  I fail to see how this is some Great Rip-off.

What I dislike is when after two years after a console's initial release they re-release it normally looking a lot better and normally slighter smaller too.<br /><br />I don't question the technological improvements behind it but rather could they have released the console with that design in the first place or did they hold out on us in order to relaunch it? It has now become almost standard practice.

Yes, it's sucktacular when you buy something, then find out the &quot;better&quot; one is coming out in a few months, but that's just how things work. If it <em>really</em> bothers you that much, then I would recommend you stay away from most smartphones, and basically anything that comes from Apple. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />I wait for things to mature a bit, as well. However, there <em>does</em> need to be a cutoff point, otherwise you'll be stuck in a &quot;I wanted this, but I waited for the revision, but now this newer thing is coming out and I don't want that other thing as much anymore, but I need to wait for this newer thing to have a revision, blah blah blah&quot; limbo where you never obtain anything. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Sorry dude, but this is just a common risk you have to take when you go to buy something. Not just video games, either. Things take time to develop, and we release our milestones. Why did Ford bother making any cars if we're just going to all have hoverboards eventually? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
