There's two main factors (as I see it) that come into play: Your particular TV and your personal tastes. Personal tastes is easy to understand. What might look perfectly fine to you, wont look good or *perfect* to others. The TV you're using also matters a great deal. This is something I've always known, but I only recently discovered how wide the margin is here.<br /></div><br /><br />I pointed out that multiple &quot;identical&quot; SNES's have different encoder setups that appear the same. The S-video and Component have looked the same across six different televisions, some CRTs, some shitty LCDs, one Plasma. While you are correct that different televisions will handle it differently, I am fairly confident in the S-video's Luma channel to be a functional Y. As for the Pb and Pr, that takes much experimentation on a per-user basis. <br /><br />I have done a few other ones, and they were correct better without the capacitors. Not all super nintendos were created equal.

While I don't know what the appropriate voltage should be, I'm guessing that's way to high.

Y should be around 1.5, of course this depends on what all is on-screen (a black screen would give a much lower level).<br /><br />My Pr and Pb are similarly high, but I am not sure what the levels are supposed to be in the first place. With the capacitors it seems to have changed very little. They are positive leg to the encoder, negative leg to the output jacks.

The download contains two datasheets as well as a schematic for an early version of the SNES.<br /><br /><br />I suggested a while ago (in the Racketboy thread) taking Pr and Pb from the inputs rather than the outputs of the encoder, but the idea was shot down because the circuit that it passes through weakens the signal. At the time we were only concerned about amplifying them. Now it appears that Pr and Pb actually need to be weakened (voltage lowered) and then amplified. <br /><br />I'm currently trying two different 6db amps, as per kyuusaku's suggestion. I'll post the results of them once I have something worth posting about.

At the time we were only concerned about amplifying them.</div><br />That's an odd way of thinking since it looks like the chip takes RGB and then passes it though a matrix in the S-ENC, 6 dB amps the Y, outputs Pr and Pb, and passes them through a filter to prep them to go back into the S-ENC where they're further processed into Composite/Chroma. So if the filters were needed to prep the Pr and Pb output lines for further conversion/matrix-ing why would we want to bypass them and take the direct output? Sure the direct output works but some people find the colors are off or it's better to use the Y output from the multi-av port pin 7. We might get more consistent results in the end if we approach it a bit differently.<br /><br />I'm interested to see what you figure out with the amplification you're playing around with.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I've had some success with the amps, but let me explain...<br /><br />First, just so we're all on the same page. When I talk about the encoder's output pins, I'm talking about pins 1 and 24. When I'm talking about the input pins, I'm talking about pins 10 and 11. <br /><br />So like I said before, the voltage on the output pins is way too high. The 6dB amps (OPA360) that I'm using wouldn't work because of it (I think they have a max input voltage of 1.5v). So, I thought if I took Pr and Pb from the input pins, at the very least I would be able to get some sort of results with it. The voltage on the input pins is substantially lower than the output pins. So I tried that, along with 1k resistors to ground on the amp's inputs, and it worked. And the colors looked a lot closer to where they should be.<br /><br />The problem though, is that it messed up the composite output (I usually switch between composite and component to check the colors). The composite is all green now. It's hard to explain with out a pic, but it's like composite has a translucent green overlay on it.<br /><br />But, at least I know now what has to be done. I think. I take Pr and Pb from the output pins, kill off the voltage, then pass it through a 6dB amp. I'm not completely sure how I should kill the voltage though.<br /><br />We have the datasheets for the BA6591 and BA6592 encoders, but they both show slightly different schematics between the Pr and Pb output an input pins. <br /><br /><img src="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g295/Ziggy587/PrPb-BA6591.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g295/Ziggy587/BA6592.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Of course, I'm no electrical engineer, so I don't really know how exactly I should kill the voltage before inputting into the amp. These schematics look like a good starting place to me, but I don't know which one is the better choice. Or maybe neither, or a modified version of one of them. <br /><br />So, if any one could help me out with this part, that'd be great.<br /><br />I'll also note that I decided to ditch the OPA360 amps and go with another TI amp, for a few reasons.

So I'm planning on taking them from the outputs but putting them through the same resistor/cap circuit that they would be on the board.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Ziggy587 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'll also note that I decided to ditch the OPA360 amps and go with another TI amp, for a few reasons.</div><br /><br />The other amp I'm gonna try is the THS7314, I just have to wait for it to come in the mail first. They're both 6dB amps, but I think the THS7314 is better for our use. One, it's 5v while the OPA360 is 3.3v. It has 3 inputs, so you only need one IC compared to two. And it's SOIC which is much easier to work with than SC70. <br /><br />One thing I'm a little confused about is DC and AC coupling. The datasheets for both amps show schematics for both DC and AC coupled outputs, but I'm really not sure which one I should be using. Does any one know?<br /><br />edit: I was just reading the datasheet for the NJM2267 (amp used in the N64 RGB mod on GameSX). It too is a 6dB amp, with two inputs (perfect for what we need here), but it also says it's a 75ohm driver. So would this be a better choice? I just don't know enough about this stuff.<br /><br />I don't think kyuusaku has logged onto the forums here in a while now, but I sure would like his input on all this.

Characteristic impedance has to do with whether the cable is electrically matched to the input and output circuits of video devices, which are all designed to accept or emit signals at 75 ohm impedance (meaning, essentially, that for every volt of signal presented, current will flow through the circuit at the rate of 1/75 ampere). When device inputs and outputs are not impedance-matched, portions of the signal can be reflected back and forth through the connection between them; in a severe case, this will manifest itself as ghosting, or &quot;ringing,&quot; of the image. When a cable is badly-matched to the input and output impedances, the output device, in a manner of speaking, &quot;sees&quot; a load of the wrong impedance, and the input device does likewise, causing these reflections.</div>
