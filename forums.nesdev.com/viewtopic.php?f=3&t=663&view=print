		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've just finsihed a set of ROMs that test an emulator's MMC3 IRQ counter operation. They've been tested and pass on Super Mario Bros. 3, Mega Man 3, and Crystalis boards. Most of the tests manually clock A12 by writing to $2006, so your emulator must implement that or most of the tests will fail. I've also included some new/different information I found while verifying <a href="http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/mmc3/index.html" class="postlink">kevtris's MMC3 information</a>. Complete source is included.

I assumed Crystalis is probably older, so I named that behavior revision A. It would be nice to know which is the best/most compatible revision to support.

<br />Give me a shipping address and I'll send you bits for both your control deck and carts.  These also work on SNES/Famicom systems, FWIW.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was reading more of Kevin Horton's mapper specs and came across MMC6. I have a feeling that my SMB3 and Mega Man 3 cartridges have an MMC6 in them (maybe Nintendo had a surplus of them). What I've called rev A and rev B <em>might</em> correspond to MMC6 and MMC3. Apologies for making assertions based on lack of information (regardless of whether it turns out to be incorrect). I simply assumed that these had MMC3 in them, even though I never saw the boards (I will be able to in a few days when koitsu's donated game bit tools arrive).
<br />
<br />Update: Well, my SMB3 cartridge acts like it has 8K of SRAM, so it's probably not MMC6 with its 1K with 512 byte banks.

I've tried a couple of MMC3 games with that, and they work ok (including Crystalis). Plus, <em>My Life My Love - Boku no Yume - Watashi no Negai (J)</em>, that used to look very messy in-game, looks correct now.

At the very least, I had no problem clocking the IRQ manually by toggling VADDR bit 12 even when PPU rendering was off, which is very clearly claimed to not work. I have a feeling some of the inaccuracy in descriptions of mapper hardware are due to misinterpretation of logic-analyzer results (probably a lot easier to overlook something when it's so raw). By running normal 6502 code, that error isn't possible.

<br />I was using CopyNES to do the reverse engineering work; specifically using bankwatch (the NES register debugger add-on) and real live carts with a real live PPU.  It might have been something odd with my NES that I used... I'm not really sure.  Even I was mystified at to why I couldn't do it manually... since it *should* have worked.  When I make some more copyNES units for pople, I will give it another try.  AFAIR I tried a couple different carts too with different MMC3's.
<br />
<br />I'm wondering if there is some kind of "filtering" going on in the MMC3... like it only responding to an edge every N M2 clocks or something, otherwise it'd trigger multiple times a scanline (for each sprite fetch).
<br />
<br />I have another little add-on I use for RE'ing IRQs called "IRQ master".  It's a small 8 digit hex counter that counts M2 cycles between a start trigger and the falling of /IRQ.  Knowing the number of cycles it takes from trigger to IRQ then can be used to determine how long it took.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The gamebits arrived and I was able to open the cartridges to check their boards and MMC3 revisions. Super Mario Bros. 3 had TSROM-07 with MMC3B and Crystalis had TKROM-01 also with MMC3B. I'm not sure why Crystalis tested differently when loading the IRQ counter with 0. Oh, and the date codes on the MMC3B chips are 9027 and 9024, so they were made literally within three weeks of each other.
<br />
<br />I ran some 6502 code to manually clock A12 as quickly as possible (12 CPU clocks each). All clocks were registered. This is still slower than the claimed 42 toggles per scanline generated by the PPU.
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ldx #$0f<br />ldy #$ff<br /><br />stx $2006&nbsp; &nbsp;; vaddr = $0fff<br />sty $2006<br />lda $2007&nbsp; &nbsp;; vaddr = vaddr + 1<br /><br />stx $2006&nbsp; &nbsp;; vaddr = $0fff<br />sty $2006<br />lda $2007&nbsp; &nbsp;; vaddr = vaddr + 1<br /></div>
<br />
<br />I tried removing the 220pF capacitor across A12 and Super Mario Bros. 3 ran just fine, so it's probably not there to filter out the rapid A12 changes during a scanline.

<br />1. Any suggestions for error 3 in MMC3 IRQ (scanline) timing test ROM?
<br />
<br />2. Could you explain the "2) Should reload and set IRQ every clock when reload is 0", regarding test 6, MMC3 Rev B ?
<br />
<br />3. As far as I understand, there are two reloads: when writing to C001 (reloads on next A12 rising) and when the IRQ counter=0 is clocked (write to C000=00)... is this correct?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1. If you're getting error 3, "Scanline 0 time is too late", then your IRQ on the first scanline is probably occurring too late.
<br />
<br />2. This is the test code:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda #2;&#41; Should reload and set IRQ every clock when reload is 0<br />ldx #0<br />jsr begin_counter_test&nbsp; ; load counter with zero<br />jsr clock_counter&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; clock counter<br />jsr should_be_set&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; fails if flag isn't set, then clears flag<br />jsr clock_counter&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; clock counter<br />jsr should_be_set&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; fails if flag isn't set, then clears flag<br />jsr clock_counter&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; clock counter<br />jsr should_be_set&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; fails if flag isn't set, then clears flag</div>
<br />
<br />3. Yes, that's my understanding and what I get when I scan the <a href="http://nesdevwiki.org/wiki/MMC3" class="postlink">MMC3 Wiki page</a> for "load". I hope you understand that what the test ROMs call MMC3 A and MMC3 B are two different versions of the MMC3 that behave differently, thus an emulator cannot pass both tests unless it has a manually-selectable MMC3 version that you set appropriately.
