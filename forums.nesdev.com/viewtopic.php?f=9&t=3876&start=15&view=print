I refrain from calling them "AV Famicoms" when I can since the box doesn't actually say that anywhere on it.. it does advertise having AV, but the name still reads in huge lettering, "FAMILY COMPUTER" and off in a corner, "AV".

It's because they were manufactured so late that they're still relatively easy to find still new as opposed to a "1983" Famicom which were manufactured until at least 1994 but are a few dozen times scarcer new.

<br />The most expensive I've seen them is $45 (in Japan anyway) and they were price gouged. I got one boxed for $35 and a couple others loose with accessories for $30. Just find someone who will make you a good deal and not give you the eBay price. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Personally I think they look better with the FDS than the HVC001s do.

<br />Exaggerating a little? $45, price gouged? You can easily find $120 AVFCs in Akiba or Den Den or Yahoo Japan. Sure they can be had for $45, but aside from backwoods shops probably not complete/mint.

<br />
<br />$45 is price gouged when there is no box, no cables, no power brick. Just the unit and 2 controllers, no manuals either.
<br />
<br />I've shopped in Akiba and compared it to Aomori prefecture area cities (like Hachinohe and Towada), which yes, is a fairly rural area. Here you'll find a loose HVC001 with all its hookups, manuals and box all in decent shape for about $20-$30. In Akihabara I saw yellowed HVC001s with no boxes, cables, power bricks or manuals going for close to $90. It was pretty ridiculous. Akihabara tailors to people prepared to buy lots of rare shit and not real retro gamers, people prepared to spend their whole paycheck on a game to keep it mint-sealed-in-box and never play it... but in this case it's just a case of classic profiteering as the condition was still SHIT.
<br />
<br />That said you do need to shop around. I got a Mega CD Model 2 complete and barely used in the box for ~$80 and another shop wanted over $200 for the same. Outrageous. But in general considering average prices everything in Tokyo was 2-3x the price in Northeastern Japan e.g. Aomori.
