		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Updating a full name table takes much longer than the time of VBlank, so it's just not possible to update a full name table from one frame to the next. I debugged your ROM, and it seems that when the name table updates finally finish the PPU is already rendering scanline 128! And by the time rendering is turned on, the scroll is pointing to the top of the name table, which is all cyan, so that's what gets rendered for the remaining of the frame.<br /><br />Since you are updating the name table every frame (a game would typically update it just once whenever a new screen needed to be loaded), you get the top 128 scanlines blanked out (rendering is disabled) and the rest filled with sky every frame, which is why you can't see anything but cyan.<br /><br />Most games will update the name tables incrementally, instead of all at once. Just open any game that scrolls in FCEUX, look at the name table viewer and move around a little. All name table updates are incremental, because the time available for sending data to VRAM is very limited. A game that doesn't scroll could switch rendering off, update the new name table all at once, and then enable rendering on, but that would cause the screen to blink briefly, so even games without scrolling could benefit from incremental name table updates.
