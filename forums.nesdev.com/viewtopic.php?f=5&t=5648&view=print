		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not necessarily talking about the ones that go into computer displays and cellphones, I'm talking about the older ones that have the larger pixels and the smaller resolutions.
<br />
<br />There's this one thing I've been very curious about, but I can't seem to find any appreciable information on how it was done:
<br />
<br />I had this toy computer thing that had what looked like a Passive Matrix LCD, but it was in color, instead of black and white. I read about color lcds having their pixels subdivided into red green and blue, but I could *swear* that it used a different method to make color on the screen, especially since the pixels were quite big, and the subdivided pixels would be quite obvious. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />There was this one time where I left it in sunlight for a few hours, and when I came back, the display was completely black/navy blue. If I recall correctly, as the display faded back to normal, the color shifted from navy blue to red, and then back to normal.
<br />
<br />Would anyone know what I'm talking about? I even remember my ti-83 being able to display blue pixels when the contrast was high enough, even though pixels were normally black on it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From LCD to CRT I have not heard of any color display that used anything but RGB. Its technically possible different method could be used like maybe CMYK like what is used in printing but but if the pixels are not blending together it would not really matter, it would seem it was just not obvious or perhaps the pixelation you saw was due to the toy computer's output resolution being very low and not the screens actual pixel sizes.
<br />
<br />its simple enough to find out just get real close to the screen and you can see the individual colors

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was looking around a little more. LCDs deal with polarized light, so the variable you have is the orientation of the light. I searched for color polarizers and found this:

<br />
<br />It's written in Legal though, so I'll need to come back to this once I have the time to comb through it and figure out what it means, exactly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In the city I live, the parking meters use a red/transparent LCD to indicate when they're expired. However, this is apparently a function of the polarizer, so you'd need a much more expensive assembly to get CMYK pixel blocks. 
<br />
<br />Also, the (many year old) color E-Ink prototypes I'd seen were arrays of CMYK dots. (It's kinda unfortunate, because you lose a lot of saturation)
<br />
<br />Have you seen the old liquid-crystal based thermometers? I've not seen them much recently. Or mood rings. Liquid crystal can change the color it selects for based on temperature or pressure.

<br />
<br />This is a pretty interesting read so far. I just hate that whenever you search for color lcd, it only brings up computer displays where each pixel is subdivided into subpixels, and then nobody else documents these other techniques. :/
