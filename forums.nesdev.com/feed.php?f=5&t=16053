Brown has always stood out to me as a colour with no coherent body of meaning of its own. If i say brown and my friend says brown, we're very likely to think of two nuances that look very far apart when compared. But if we say red, both are likely to imagine an intense &quot;perfect&quot; red you'd expect from plastics, more or less #ff0000.<br /><br />On sources, i really recomnend reading a chapter or two from Michel Foucault on this. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology_of_knowledge" class="postlink">Archaelogy of knowledge</a> is both enjoyable and helpful in forming a solid concept of post-structuralist thinking re: language/knowledge, power and discourse. Foucault's definition of &quot;power&quot; is especially useful, though that's more in other texts. It's a bit of a commitment though so choose passages wisely or find the cliff's notes.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Thu Jun 08, 2017 1:17 pm</p><hr />

Especially as it's not a naturalist description, but has higher priorities (such as both being interesting to listen to and easy to remember, through the device of repeated, memorable descriptions, such as rose-fingered Eos, etc). I can easily subscribe to the &quot;dark as wine&quot; theory - especially as light and dark seemed to play a rather dominant role in colour descriptions. <br /><br />What is a bit more convincing is the frequency on colour names: There's zero descriptions of blue in the work of Homeros. On its own, it's just a peculiarity, but when other texts from different places have comparable frequencies, it starts to amount to something. <br /><br />And then, philosophers of the time argued about what colours exist and how they should be named and categorized, such as the argument that the rainbow has four bands. Their business was understanding nature, so it's a pretty hands-on insight into what scholars thought at that time in that region, if you can overlook the varying inadequacy of translations.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">adam_smasher wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Happily, there's no need to guess about this stuff thanks to the Online Etymology Dictionary<br /></div><br />Got to love etymology.

the title and simmare of the thread was in reference to the movie &quot;blue is the warmest colour&quot;.<br /><br />Of course, the literal band of spectrum we call blue is as primal as light itself. I'm not arguing against the laws of physics. <br /><br />But we're talking about ancient to antique definitions of colour here. Based on linguistic and archeological evidence, the first definitions of colours tend to be black/white or light/dark, then there's recognition of the colour red, then green or yellow, depending on. If your system of categorization of hue is red and green only, the continuum of what we call blue in modern time is probably split somewhere in the middle, colder colours being labeled green and warmer being labeled red. That split can happen anywhere. To modern sensibility, the mediterranean sea would probably be described as blue, gray, or green depending on weather and light conditions, but to homeros, it was dark wine-coloured, while sheep are always referred to as violet. In other words: definitions change over time.<br /><br />Here's a non-colour example. How would you categorize animals? Most would say mammals, reptiles, molluscae, and so on (a bit depending on the granularity of the categorization). What sort of animals live in the sea? According to that categorization, fish, birds, molluscae, mammals... Long before modern time, the predominant categorization of animals was not based on darwinian zoology but on a mixed set of criteria, like their function in human life, their behaviour, looks, and habitat. Fish has been a category for animals living in water. You can find beavers categorized as fish in bestiaries. Whales were fish, clams were fish... probably sirens, too. This definition is equally true as the modern day definition, until the culture begins to use the category &quot;fish&quot; as exclusive description for what we call fish today. It only appears false when you measure it with the darwinian definition, which would be an anachronism.<br /><br />Likewise, definitions of personal age has been more closely tied to social contracts before the exact measurement and documentation of time and events. A disciple was &quot;young&quot; to its master, despite that they may actually be of similar age, and a priest is still called &quot;father&quot; despite that the priest may actually be younger. <br /><br />In my language, the word for dinner is middag, &quot;middle of the day&quot;, but we eat it between somewhere after work and the evening. The practice has changed. The word has not. Its meaning has become discursively distorted, it does not signify &quot;middle of the day&quot; any more even though it's spelled out clearly.<br /><br /><br />Besides, it's false logic to assume a linguistic split (roman and german) means the speakers of languages don't continue to trade words and definitions with each other. That happened even in the dark ages (especially then, actually). Splits only describe a broad stroke. French (parisian) was a minority language in what we call france until surprisingly late, but i'm mostly sure they shared basic words for colours with lombards, normands, etc.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Thu Jun 08, 2017 3:28 am</p><hr />

There's a lot to be said about colours, both in linguistics, and discourse theory. (Discourse here meaning &quot;institutionalized patterns of knowledge (...)&quot;, quote from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_analysis" class="postlink">wik</a>i). <br /><br />It's not just english, either. There seems to be a general pattern in how linguistic distinctions between colours evolved, with local variants. <br /><br />Perception, cognition and memory are all very susceptible to how we categorize things.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Thu Jun 08, 2017 12:24 am</p><hr />

I'm going to assume the concept is just lost in translation on you, Bregalad.<br /><br />The point, however, is that <em>linguistically</em>, &quot;blue&quot; is one of the later colors to be named, chronologically.
