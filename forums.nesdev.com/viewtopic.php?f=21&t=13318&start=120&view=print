		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Alpha transparency is a very complex concept, that even the SNES and Genesis struggle with</div><br />Well, it's a hardware feature on the SNES, even if it is relatively limited. It's generally better suited for BGs than sprites, and I can think of plenty major commercial games that use it, most notably the DKC games. However, I can't think of many games that use alpha channel sprites. One kind of cool, although limited, effect is found in Firepower 2000 which always has transparency for sprites on is that whenever an explosion happens, it is at first opaque, but then uses the transparent palette for when it is fading away. palettes 4-7 are exactly the same as 0-3 to allow effects like this. However, I've never understood the Genesis's shadow and highlight modes. I think I remember hearing something about how it either halves the color values of something or doubles them. Also, does this only work for sprites, because I remember messing with the Sonic 3 and Knuckles debug mode and moving around a transparent waterfall slap sprite.<br /><br />But yeah, the NES doesn't have anything like this in hardware. In fact, I'm pretty sure that even most &quot;16 bit&quot; arcade machines didn't. If the Neo Geo had SNES alpha transparency capabilities for sprites, it would be totally useless, because it would clip through everything. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

The object should be spawned regardless of how it's drawn. It can have a hitbox and its own behaviour even if doesn't use any sprites.<br /><br />As for making a background object flash, there are several ways that can be done. The most obvious is to redraw the tiles at the same rate of the flicker. If the object is small enough and you're not using much of the vblank time for other things, this should be easy. Another option would be to make sure that the colors used by the object itself are not used anywhere else in the background, and then you could simply change the palette to make the object flash white, or whatever color you want. Yet another option is to overlay white sprites with the same shape as the object over it, only when necessary, so you only affect the sprite count temporarily.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Not necessarily easy, but it could be done. I imagine you'd have to keep track of where those tiles lay in the nametable and update them each frame. You'll have to store tiles for every position in which the door will be. So you'd need a tile for each pixel movement. It doesn't look like a door that would move quickly.<br /><br />The moving collision detection would take a little work. One method would be to put a moving object over top of the door. I haven't personally done ejections from objects though, so I'm not sure how that works. Ejection from tiles is usually done by determining the distance to the next multiple of 16 pixel location. I suppose you could use the width of both hitboxes to determine a suitable ejection location for x axis and likewise with hitbox heights and y axis.<br /><br />I've never done this personally so I wonder if anyone has any other suggestions. I don't think it would be too hard.

I suppose you could make the very bottom of the door a sprite (a few sprites). That would smooth the door's movements, and you could calculate collision based on the sprite. But, now that I look at your door, that wouldn't look right...only if it was a plainer looking door. For your door, it will probably have to be a background object.

If you see when opening the door it blocks you from the chest but keeping it closed after you go through you wont be able to make that jump. Though there will be some power-ups throughout the stage to help you in situations where you need to fill in that gap.
