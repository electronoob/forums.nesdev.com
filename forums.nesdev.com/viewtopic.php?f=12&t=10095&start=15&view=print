The SRAM256K part is the DIP-28 footprint, so the /CE line is the signal coming in from the decoder, and the CE with the bar over it is the actual pin on the FRAM chip.  I probably could have better optimized the PCB layout by selecting which gates to hook up to what based on physical location, but the traces are simple enough I didn't bother.<br /><br /><img src="http://i41.tinypic.com/4j59x0.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/qxmjch.png" alt="Image" />

I'd recommend GND because I think you have a ground fill super close to those pins anyway.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The nice thing about EAGLE is that if the schematic is correct, it connects the PCB pins for you (you have to do the actual tracing, but it knows what's supposed to connect to what, so you can't accidentally connect 2 pins that aren't connected on the schematic or it yells at you).  I'll go ahead and ground the unused gate inputs.

Would you just hook it straight up to pin 46 on the cart edge?  That's how the MAD-1 boards seem to do it... but the MAD-1 is decoded off of BA4 and BA5, where your schematic is decoding off of BA5 and BA6 (you call them CA21 and CA22).  Also, would I then need glue logic between the 139 and the ROM /CS line?  Y0 NAND Y1, maybe?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />After extensively looking at this, I can't find a reason why what you have wouldn't work.<br /><br />The only caveat is that the FeRAM maps into banks 60h-6Fh as well as banks 70h-7Dh. I don't forsee this being a problem. Bank 6xh with A15=0 is ordinarily for the DSP-1 or whatever coprocessor for certain rom sizes. Shouldn't matter for what you're using it for.<br /><br />The long chain of gates doesn't seem like it will glitch in a way to cause issues, and games are supposed to access Battery RAM in the slow speed area anyways.<br /><br />Would there be a way to save maybe 1 or 2 nand gates? probably, but let's not worry about it.

It never caused issues (and it shouldn't). That area would be open bus otherwise.<br />I was trying to make the circuit have the bare minimum components to run, a goal you probably agree with.<br />I was just warning you of anything I knew was off, in case you were about to make a run of 10,000 of these or something.
