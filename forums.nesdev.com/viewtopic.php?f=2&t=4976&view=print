		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So for a while, I've been working on my project ChateauLevania. I want this to be a really professional looking game that basically shows what I can do, and shows what people wouldn't believe the NES can do. For this, I decided I needed lots of PRG, CHR RAM, and SRAM.
<br />
<br />The perfect board, I thought would be FF3j's board, as it allows for 512k of PRG, CHR RAM, and SRAM. Also it allows for 8k PRG bankswitching and a scanline counter, which is great. So I started building my project around this board.
<br />
<br />However, now I realize that this board really isn't that great. I don't use the scanline counter and don't even plan on it, and besides sacrificing FF3j's board sounded fine at first but now I'm reconsidering. I do want people to be able to purchase this game when I'm finished with it, but I don't want it to end up being super expensive. Now that I think about this, I should probably change mappers.
<br />
<br />So what's a mapper/board that I could use that would allow for lots of PRG, SRAM, and CHR RAM that wouldn't be so hard to come by? I would <em>need</em> all of those things (PRG space, CHR RAM and SRAM), along with good bankswitching capabilities.
<br />
<br />I did, while reading Disch's mapper docs come across a very -lovely- mapper that has everything I need and more, however I feel it might be really hard to find. It has great bankswitching capabilities, CHR ROM and CHR RAM, a cycle based IRQ counter (how wonderful; I'd actually use it), SRAM, and a game that has 512k of PRG. This is the one and only N106. It also has extra audio of course, which leads me to believe that this mapper is famicom/Japan only, is it not? This mapper's awesomeness, assuming it isn't TOO rare, might be worth using regardless of its cost/rareness.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Crap, I think I lied about the 512k of PRG. But it might be possible to still make good use of this mapper, as I can store stuff in CHR ROM and still use CHR RAM.

<br />
<br />I guess the MMC3 sounds fine but if you're not using the scanline counter at all and don't mind a different bankswitching sheme you'd want to go for MMC1, SUROM like DW3 and DW4. You can mod a simple common Zelda cart in order to get such a configuration.

<br />
<br />MMC1 seems to have a strange bankswitching scheme. I would prefer as little fixed bank-ness as possible. 8k PRG banks are ideal for me, and what I liked about the N106 is that only $E000-$FFFF is fixed.
<br />
<br />Hmm, Mapper 32 seems to allow for lots of PRG banks, 8k, as the switching register is 8 bits wide. I'm not sure if it can have SRAM/CHR RAM though. Those two things are an even bigger must than anything PRG related. I guess I'll keep looking.

<br />
<br />The advantage of big fixed banks is that you can fit plenty of routines in them, and you'll find yourself bankswitching less often and gaining some speed.
<br />
<br />Mapper 32 looks like it is an obscure japanese mapper but if you somehow manage to make a devcard from it I'd say go for it. However it looks like it's a CHR ROM mapper so maybe you haven't investigated enough.
<br />
<br />In fact I'd almost say the vast majority of mappers were designed to work with CHR-ROM. Mappers 1, 2, 4, 7 and 34 (GNROM) are more or less the only ones that supports CHR-RAM (there may be a few other rare/funky mappers as well).

I just thought I'd see if there was an easier solution. Oh, but now I'm quite envious looking at N106 and its IRQ counter/bankswitching capabilities. With that you could actually have PCM playing in real time (though you'd basically allow the rest of the code only a small amount of time).

<br />
<br />That might induce the question "so then how do we get said games to run on actual hardware?", and the answer would be "find someone who does EE and has great familiarity with an FPGA".  :-)
<br />
<br />To Celius: go with MMC3.  It's supported everywhere (emulator-wise) fairly well, and the chips for it (on PCBs) should be easily obtainable (it was a common mapper).  I don't know if it supports up to 512KB of PRG/CHR swapping though -- you might have to cut your game down in size, or consider using some software compression (especially of tiles).

<br />I'm pretty sure nobody will agree on what features are essencial and what features aren't, and in the end nothing serious will be done. Also, too many people seems to be under the impression that to do a good game you need a good mapper. This is wrong, SMB is the proof. If you say "yes but this is a very simple game" you are right, then take DW4, it's really a complex game with a vast world, many unrelated quests, etc... and it is a MMC1 game, they did not need any complex mapper to do it. I have yet to see any NES homebrew games that is significantly more complex than SMB anyway.
<br />
<br />The MMC5 has any features and nothing really better could exist (or anyone complainig about the lack of a 4-color mode 7 for the NES ?), but it only allows for CHR-ROM, altough many advantages of CHR-RAM can be compensated with the possibilities of the MMC5.

<br />
<br />FF3's board supports 512k of PRG data. $8001 is the bank selection register, and it's 8 bits wide. If I'm not mistaking, that could select up to 256 different 8k banks, which would make the max size 2048k. Either way, 512k is possible because FF3 has it, and 512k is enough. I plan to have 256k of that data be CHR data. And I need it uncompressed because the NMI routine can update CHR data from ROM during Vblank, and if the data was compressed that wouldn't fly so well.
<br />
<br />The idea of a new mapper is pretty cool, but Bregalad is right in saying that you don't need a mega-mapper to make a good game. I'm not exactly using a mega mapper (though 512k of PRG data is a lot, kind of), and I hope to blow everyone away with what I come out with. Though it would be hard to make emulators support a new mapper. And there are a bunch of values for the mapper ID that aren't used, but while everyone's adding support for a new mapper for all these emulators, the NES header format should be updated because there are a lot of flaws with it.

<br />Well not in discrete chips I assure you, it was just way too painful. Perhaps the next RetroUSB thing will be what you guys are looking for if it's reconfigurable. If I ever go back to my game, it will surely use a subset of FME-7 too.

I have an area set aside for dynamic tile data that it can read from, so it's technically possible to decompress data to that section and put it on the screen. But I don't feel it's necessary given the amount of space I can work with. And cutting down from 512k to 256k is a really big decision that I don't think I'm going to make.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">We'd have to check with the ones still dumping new carts that use new mappers, such as <a href="http://cah4e3.shedevr.org.ru/dumping_2009.php" class="postlink">Sanchez (Санчез)</a>, before filling it with fairy-dust mappers.</div>
<br />
<br />This is even more proof that the iNES format should be updated. There are 8 bytes in the header that aren't even used; a lot could be done with these. And why do they have to be clear in order for games to work?? It's not like a game relies on these unrelated bytes being 0...
