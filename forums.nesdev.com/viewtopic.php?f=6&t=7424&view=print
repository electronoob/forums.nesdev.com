Moero Pro Yakyuu is the Japanese version of Bases Loaded, and it has an onboard sound chip playing one of 16 recordings of sampled speech. A modern version of this would play .mp3 or .ogg background music, sort of like <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=25067#25067" class="postlink">this hardware hack</a> but with software control of the track number.
<br />
<br />Is there a repository of Game Genie or hex codes to silence the music in numerous NES games, leaving only sound effects?
<br />

<br />I tested this playing the first temple:
<br />
<br />-level up sound does the same
<br />-picking up an item does the same
<br />-it will do it again for the music for a boss

<br />

<br />-music will play a short note, then be silent until the boss theme.
<br />-death music still plays
<br />
<br />Castlevania:
<br />
<br />Disable Music Stage 1 - Watch the first two demonstrations.  When it starts on the third, press 'START.'  The intro music should play, but the music for the first stage shouldn't.  It will resume after you die.  The boss theme will stay play.

They match what all of the music on-screen should be. So far they've done this with Contra, Ninja Gaiden, and Mega Man 2.

<br />
<br />But they're interested in seeing what options are available for keeping the SFX intact on the NES while all of the music is disabled. We've already ruled out channel isolation, of course. Is it feasible to modify these roms to disable all music tracks from starting? Would anyone be interested in helping with that? I think they're also interested in Castlevania and Mike Tyson's Punch-Out, in addition to the above titles. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> 
<br />
<br />For the time being, they've sampled some of the SFX and they actually have the player trigger whatever ones he can from a sampler (like "boss getting killed" and "fortress explodes" in Ninja Gaiden since they occur in down time/during cutscenes). But yeah, that's a limiting and roundabout solution.

<br />
<br />Hello friends.  Thanks to the glorious hand of bucky o'hare, it looks like a Bit Brigade dream might come true!  I play guitar in Bit Brigade and we have been talking a lot lately about what to add to our repertoire of games.  As bucky has already said, it currently consists of MM2, Ninja Gaiden, and Contra.  The next big idea is to do Punch-Out, but with classic brawler/action/boss themes in place of the regular P-O fight music (saving that for Tyson himself).  Of course, we quickly realized that watching someone play Punch-Out, even if there's a rock band blaring in real time, seems empty and awkward without the copious sound effects.
<br />
<br />Anyone who could help us in this endeavor would be heroic!  I already own a PowerPak, so that's settled.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />And yes, bucky, I do believe CV1 is a possibility!  Double Dragon 2 is looking good these days as well.  Hell, if we could get SFX roms of all the games we already do, that would bring our experience to an overwhelmingly ultimate nexus (if I do say so myself...I'm still new to the band and still look at it from a fan's perspective a lot of the time! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />)

Maybe just replacing calls to the music init with NOPs would work in some cases.  In all the NSFs I ripped, I only included the sfx whenever it was the same init address as the music (and didn't require obscene amounts of re-ordering the track list).

<br />NG was a lot easier to peg down because it has a sound test built in the game that even uses the on screen number as an offset for the pointer.
<br />
<br />If one of you guys want to try doing one, go ahead and pick one and just post about it, and I'll just move onto another one and post about it.
