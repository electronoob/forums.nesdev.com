		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi Guys,<br /><br />In a month or 2 or 3, give or take approx. , I am going to order GB Flasher PCBs. Details on pricing to come, If anyone would like to combine the order, I can ask him to ship for me to difference places, or I can ship them to you, provided you paypal me the cost of your board + shipping. I really don't look to make any profit out of this.<br /><br />The board will likely be like the following:<br />I plan to add six plated holes to the pcb file, connected to the microcontroller, to place pin headers in, for easy ISP (in-system programming).<br /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7398/9189980332_eb8a892732.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />On a personal note, this pcb was designed by someone in spanish, with no contact info I couldn't find on the page it was hosted at. However, it seems the only distinction between this pcb and the original GB flasher is the use of the FTDI ft232R instead of FT232B, whereas the R internalizes more components (see <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/ICs/FT232R.htm">http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/ICs/FT232R.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/ICs/FT232B.html">http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/ICs/FT232B.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I have no guarentee of the original GB flasher software in performance with this device, however, the guy who created this PCB has released specific firmware and software(multiplatform iirc), for this device. I did a diff of his firmware and the original and i looked them in a hex editor, they didn't even RELATE. I wonder if the format was different? Either way, I believe I will try this one out. Worst comes to worst, I plan to design my own firmware, for fun.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys, little update<br /><br />I went to the discussion forums on Eagle Cad to get some help working with the schematics and board files. I didn't get approved of my modifications yet, however here is my mod for the ICSP (in-circuit-serial-programming) pin headers.<br /><br /><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3683/9203571376_5f67f85a53.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />For any guys that wanted a strictly 1-layer board, fear not. You could always modify the board and take out the top layer stuff, and replace it all with wires. <br /><br />Let me know what you guys think?<br /><br />Oh, I took a look at site for producing 10 pieces of pcb for $25. That would come down to $2.5 a board, neglecting shipping.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Microchip uses Netbeans as the base for their MPLAB X IDE, which should be cross-platform, but IIRC it doesn't come with a compiler, so you'll have to download that separately (they do have free compilers available, it's just a separate download, and different downloads for different chip families, so be sure to get the right one). Honestly, Microchip kind of (i.e. really really REALLY) sucks in the user friendliness department. They have code examples, including ones for their USB stack, but there are multiple options of compilers, and it's never clear which compiler the example is designed for. I finally got my hands on one of those chips, but so far I haven't even gotten it to enumerate. USB is a huge PitA <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No, that just means that they used the extra pins on the QFP-44 package to move the ICSP pins off of the GPIO's.  On the DIP package, the ICSP pins are shared with GPIO's and therefore &quot;use up&quot; those pins (RB6/RB7).  However, if you're careful with your design, you can share the pins without any issue.  The DIP package absolutely does have ICSP capabilities, it just doesn't get its own dedicated pins for it.  Look at the bottom of Table 1 on page 5 for PGC and PGD (aka ICSPCLK and ICSPDAT).

Will it be the exact same for PIC? What kind of design precautions must i take to share a pic icsp with gpio rather than dedicated icsp pins.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Basically, yeah.  Just make sure that whatever you're using the GPIOs for won't be bothered by the programming.  I believe that the PGC/PGD lines use logic levels for programming, but make sure of that if you're going to be connecting those pins to any other peripherals/indicator LEDs/etc.  Or, if you just connect them directly to the cart socket, the easy solution is just don't have a cart connected when you're reprogramming the microcontroller because having those lines open bus pretty much alleviates any potential issues.
