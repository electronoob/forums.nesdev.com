You cast Regen on your party and then another spell and after regen is cast you open the CD lid and the battle will not proceed until it can load the new spell so you can regenerate all your health without fear of being attacked.</div>
<br />Cool ! Thanks for sharing this. Then I guess all samples (music and lyrics) fit in the memory at once ? Or does FF7 switch out some unused music samples out of memory to witch the lyrics in when playing one-winged angel ?
<br />
<br />The SPU has 512kb of memory, 508kb which are usable, and stores samples in a compressed way so that 14 16-bit samples are stored in 16 bytes, for a 1.75 compression ratio. At a playback rate of 44100 Hz this allows to store 508 * 1.75 * 1024 / 44100 = 20.6 seconds of samples which sounds pretty decent. The SNES can only store about 4-6 seconds (at 32000 Hz) depending on how much RAM you use for your sound code and echo buffer.

Also I believe if you get a PSF rip you can hear the whole song which would seem to mean to me that the whole song is in memory. It may be possible that the main RAM could be used to load new samples into sound RAM when needed if more memory was needed for the song. 
<br />
<br />Alot of RPGs are similar on PS1 since it is critical to have the CD free for loading assets in battle since you have no chance of loading every single possible asset that may be used into memory.

Since a PSF player emulate the main CPU, any "tricks" that would be done by overwriting sound memory during playback is emulated without problem, while on the SNES this implies communication between the SPU and the CPU by those 4 registers.
<br />
<br />And while the PS1's SPU is able to play 24 voices with reverb (as opposed to 8 voices with echo), and that the encoding sheme looks slightly different but really similar to BRR, it's really an updated SPC700.

<br />What do you expect? <a href="http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-35/h2.html" class="postlink">It's a Sony</a>. Heck, I read somewhere that even MiniDisc would have used a BRR/VAG style codec instead of ATRAC had Philips not promoted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-1_Audio_Layer_I" class="postlink">MP1</a> to Sony.
<br />
<br />But then the PlayStation 2 went back to the structure of separate CPUs for the game program vs. sound.

I don't know what Wario's Wood does tough - but I guess it's possible (but terribly unoptimal) to use the SPC only with the defaule 32-byte "loader code", by loading data into the DSP directly.
<br />
<br />And now I've checked on FF7's CDROM, INSTR.ALL (contains musical samples) is 483kb and INSTR2.ALL (contians voices) is 251kb, so FF7 MUST do a trick during the replay of One Winged Angel as all samples don't fit in memry at once.[/quote]

<br />
<br />And while we're on topic how many games actually uses CDROM steaming for sound during gameplay ? I guess most games uses it only for cinema scenes, and uses sequenced music for gameplay. I might be wrong tough.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I believe you are wrong in saying "most" as I would say if there was one more dominant than the other it is sequenced music that is less common. Tons of games stream music. Mega Man X3, X4, X5, X6 all do. Oddly Mega Man 8 does not. Mortal Kombat II (japan only) uses sequenced music because they keep the CD free for in game loading. Mortal Kombat 3 uses redbook audio. Ridge Racer used it too. Twisted Metal 2 uses redbook audio. Wipeout I believe uses redbook or XA which is something I believe the PS1 MDEC decodes in addition to decoding FMV. 
<br />
<br />I wish I could think of some more but I really think it's much more common that games stream music off the disc in PS1 games than using sequenced music with samples. It really depends on the game design which they use. As I mentioned before, RPGs are alot more likely than an action game to use sequenced. But an action game (like Descent) generally loads all game resources for that level into memory and has no need to load anything during play so the CD-ROM is free for music streaming.

<br />Zoop, Geom Cube (Blockout sequel), and Forsaken (Descent clone) use Red Book audio. Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo (Baku Baku Animal clone) uses XA compressed audio. DDR 4th Mix and the US version (called Konamix) use VAG compressed audio.
<br />
<br />If you can hear the music in a CD player, it's a Red Book stream. If you lift the lid and the music stops or stalls, it's probably a compressed stream.

Pretty sure Sexy Parodius does, given that I went through hell to rip the XA tracks out and re-edit them so they weren't messed up (the CDXA extractors on the 'net at the time were crap).
<br />
<br />It's pretty surprising how many titles use XA.

Also most streamed music from mentioned games sounds like it was sequenced on a synthesizer and then recorded, as opposed to being played with a true orchestra and recorded, you can't really "know" without opening the CD tray.<br /><br />Also, I wonder how games could suddently grow from 4-6 MB (SNES) to 700 MB (PS1). If the audio is streamed, this answer my question. Also answers why there is so many games lacking PSFs. Cinema scenes are probably the answer for RPGs.<br /><br />The above statement seems true for PS2 games as well - altough I don't have many non-RPG PS1 or PS2 games.<br /><br />The most impressive should be Dragon Quest 8, which the japanese version is sequenced, and the western version streamed.  Immagine my bad surprise when I bought the japanese OST  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /> <br />I don't know how they were able to be constantly loading the music from the DVD-ROM, especially on the large overworld or during battle.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">MottZilla wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Castlevania SotN a very early title uses XA.

A CD-quality VAG compressed audio stream like that seen in DDR series or Katamari series is 50 KB per second. So every 15 seconds or so, the drive just has to take a break from whatever level data it's streaming and go grab another 750 KB of audio from the disc.
<br />
<br />In addition to the XA music (each BGM in both arcade-accurate version and a reperformed version optimized for home TV speakers), Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo likewise has a Red Book extra: an instrumental version of the song that plays as a reward for completing all 48 "Street Puzzle" (mission mode) levels.
<br />
<br />Any idea where I should split the discussion of optical disc technologies?

<br />
<br /> I also read that quite a few PSP games stream ADPCM music. Whether this is stored in ram or streamed off the disc - I'm not sure. I would assume it's not ram because of the small amount, but given the battery life for constantly accessing the disc and that the PSP has a synth unit (same as the PS1 version?) - this doesn't seem likely. Maybe somebody here experienced with PSP game hacking or development can comment on this?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The reason from SNES to PS1 games ballooned in size was because alot of SNES games used compression that was no longer needed, and then ofcourse the streamed audio and streamed video. Many games are actually very small some even tiny after stripping out streams. Ridge Racer would fit on a SNES cartridge without the CD Audio. 
<br />
<br />Starting with Dreamcast and going forward, consoles finally had optical drives fast enough (and the support for them) to do more than one thing at a time. DreamCast I remember sounded really loud because of the way it would be streaming ADX music in an open world game like Crazy Taxi where at the same time it is streaming the music it is loaded new game area as you go. Grand Theft Auto on PS2 is another good example though in a way it's a bad example cause often the DVD drive couldn't keep up and you get to an area before loading completes and it look awful. Though to be fair that game looks awful anyway.
