This way I can easily reach everything in the object slot, and when I have two identical objects, it tricks the CPU into thinking it's writting into the same registers when it isn't.</div>
<br />Isn't that the same as base+constant (4,A4) addressing on a 68000? Or is that slow due to an extra memory access? In any case, direct page and absolute,X addressing are the same speed on a 65816 if the direct page isn't 256-byte aligned and the absolute address is page-aligned.

<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; gencycle</div>
<br />
<br />The Super NES dot rate is the same as that of the NES: 3/2 Fsc, or 945/176 = 5.369 MHz. The master clock rate is four times that, and cycles take six or eight master clocks depending on whether they access slow memory (RAM or slow ROM); fast ROM and internal operation cycles always take six clocks. This gives an effective CPU rate somewhere between 2.7 and 3.6 MHz.
<br />
<br />Because of the 68000's state machine, we can consider the Genesis to have a master clock of 7.67 MHz and actually run at 1.92 MHz, where each cycle of the internal state machine takes 4 master clocks. But how exactly is the 7.67 MHz rate related to the pixel clock? It's slightly faster than the Amiga and TG16 clock speed of 2*Fsc = 7.159 MHz. The dot rate in 256px mode is the same as the NES and Super NES, and the dot rate in 320px mode is 5/4 that: 6.712 MHz. Is the 68000 clock suposed to equal 8/7 of this 320px dot rate, which would equal 10/7 times the 256px dot rate or 15/7*Fsc?
<br />
<br />To derive a clock speed useful for comparison between the Super NES and Genesis, I derive an abstract unit called the <strong>gencycle</strong> (AAAAAAAAA!), which is 1/2 of a fast (6 clock) cycle (that is, 7.159 MHz) or 1/3 of a slow (8 clock) cycle (that is, 8.054 MHz). Over the long run, the average period of a gencycle should be close to that of a Genesis master clock, allowing 65816 instruction timings to be quoted in units nearly commensurate with 68000 timings.
<br />
<br />This 12-clock 68000 instruction corresponds to 10 or 12 65816 gencycles, as seen here:
<br />
<br />Ordinary direct page instruction: 10 gc
<br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>opcode fetch: 2 gc (fast ROM) </li><li>offset fetch: 2 gc (fast ROM) </li><li>data low: 3 gc (slow RAM) </li><li>data high: 3 gc (slow RAM) (if 16-bit M/X) </li></ol>Direct page instruction, D not 256-byte aligned: 12 gc<br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>opcode fetch: 2 gc (fast ROM) </li><li>offset fetch: 2 gc (fast ROM) </li><li>address generation: 2 gc (internal) </li><li>data low: 3 gc (slow RAM) </li><li>data high: 3 gc (slow RAM) (if 16-bit M/X) </li></ol>Absolute indexed instruction: 12 gc<br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>opcode fetch: 2 gc (fast ROM) </li><li>address fetch low: 2 gc (fast ROM) </li><li>address fetch high: 2 gc (fast ROM) </li><li>data low byte: 3 gc (slow RAM) </li><li>data high byte: 3 gc (slow RAM) (if 16-bit M/X) </li></ol>
<br />But to what extent do direct MOVEs, adds and subtracts with a memory destination, hardware MULs and DIVs, and 32-bit addition and subtraction give 68000 the edge?

Gradius 3 shuffles back and forth between the low-oam and high-oam, one sprite at a time.<br /><br />The way I manage the high-oam is when I am writing a sprite to the oam, I "AND #$01ff" the x-coordinate, and "ORA #$0200" for big sprites.  Then I store the result in both the oam buffer, and a second list that is 544 bytes after the oam buffer.  Then I overwrite the high-byte of the x-coordinate with the y-coordinate, and overwrite the high-byte of the y-coordinate with the attribute word.  After all the game logic has been calculated, I use the table of 16-bit x-coordiates, and build the high-oam with it.</div>
<br />
<br />See what I mean, they wasted CPU cycles it sounds like. Causing more slowdown than needed to achieve what needed to be done. Here is a fun challenge since you might still have notes, did you try rewriting the routine optimized and seeing what sort of performance boost you could yield? That would be an impressive patch if you could significantly reduce slowdown in gradius 3.
<br />
<br />Keep in mind though I think Gradius III was Konami's first Super Famicom game. It is not that strange that it would not be coded very efficiently.

<br />More idiots passing off incorrect technical information.  They mentioned the cpu being "slow" 5 times, and wrote "slow" in all caps 4 of the 5 times.

Say the presence of DMA to VRAM is equivalent to Blast Processing, and my gencycle theory might help alleviate the capitalized SLOW-ness. Apparently the <a href="http://www.emulationzone.org/aboutus/contact/contact.htm" class="postlink">most current e-mail address</a> is wacko413 at Hotmail.
<br />
<br />The "64K at a time" part appears to have something to do with the data segment register set with the PLB instruction. On the 68000, on the other hand, a pointer fits in a single register.
