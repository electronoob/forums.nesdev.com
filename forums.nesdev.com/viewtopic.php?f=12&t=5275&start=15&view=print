<br />
<br />The glitch only occurs on revision 1 CPUs. And I'd be really surprised if they figured out how to reproduce it. The effect is seriously insane to witness. The entire system state goes straight to hell. While you'd think it was just corrupting the program counter (or the next opcode fetched after it), the destruction of absolutely everything is so extreme that it seems highly unlikely a bad execution path (invariably leading to a BRK loop or similar) could do so much damage.
<br />
<br />I really want to emulate this effect, but I would need someone with hardware tools to see what's happening at the circuit level to get it right.

<br />
<br />Only very early NTSC models have a rev. 1 CPU (i. e., only pre-1991 Super Famicoms, AFAIK). All later models have rev. 2 CPUs.

I used ROM&lt;&gt;SRAM as an example for others to understand what types of transfers are invalid without having to list each and every one.<br /><br />Amazing as it is, some games rely on this behavior. Krusty's Super Fun House performs illegal DMA transfers that, if allowed, would corrupt the in-game palette.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I didn't bother to state this because I was under the impression there was only one revision which made it out into the market. Yes/no?</div><br /><br />Revision 1 is very rare. Usually if you have an oxidized case (eg it is yellow), you have a rev. 1. Otherwise it's probably a rev. 2. I have not seen a CPU revision of 3 yet, but it may exist in the mini-SNES.<br /><br />There are real differences other than the DMA crashing glitch. They changed the way DRAM refresh and HDMA init timing works as well. Then there are also different S-PPU1, S-PPU2, S-SMP (mini-SNES lacks timer glitch) and S-DSP revisions.<br /><br />One wonders why they felt the need to keep changing shit (supplier issues?), but I digress. It gives emulators a <em>tiny</em> bit of leeway to act differently, if real hardware does as well.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I seem to remember Super Street Fighter II for Super NES not running on the earliest consoles, and Nintendo having to issue replacements.

<br />
<br />That would be very interesting if true. I always assumed developers were forced to test their games on all current versions of hardware, and if anything, only newer revisions would break older games.

<br />
<br />No. The materials used in the process of SNES casing construction don't correlate with CPU revisions.
<br />
<br />As I said, there are probably only Japanese SFC systems with rev. 1 CPUs. If there are series of US and/or PAL SNES systems at all that have a rev. 1 CPU, they are very rare and CANNOT be identified from their exterior appearance, but possibly from their serial number.

<br />
<br />I did say usually, not always. It was my impression they fixed the oxidation shortly after introducing the rev. 2 CPU. Guess that's wrong, do you have more info on that?
<br />
<br />Interesting that there aren't (m)any in the US. Only have Japanese ones myself, a 1/1/1 and 2/1/3. The US design sucked.
