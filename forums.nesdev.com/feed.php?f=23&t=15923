<div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Out of curiosity, had you ever done any work for the Mitsumi 740 microcontrollers?<br /></div><br />Should that say &quot;Mitsubishi&quot;?  I know there was a Mitsubishi microcontroller (µC) with a 65c02 at its heart, but Howard Speegle, an old but still very active and productive man who owns Diva Automation, was using them for some products he was selling, but Mits started demanding larger and larger minimum orders until it got so he could no longer continue.  Four years ago, he sent me an email, part of which is quoted below.  He gave me permission to use his material on forums where it would help promote the 6502.<br /><br /><ul><ul>The 6502 architecture remains nearly ideal in my book.  It is so sweet and regular that it is hard to screw up without great effort.  I once wrote a debug/monitor for the 6502 while waiting for my car to be serviced, assembled it in my head, drove back to the office, typed the machine code into an EPROM programmer, drove to my customer and plugged the EPROM into his system.  Unsurprisingly, it worked.  I could not do that with any other architecture I have ever seen.  I'm not bragging, I am simply describing the end result of an excellent design, that could support such a process.<br /><br />Now, after 54 years in the business, I still love the 6502, but have abandoned it for new designs simply because the only manufacturer [talking about Mits?] of this beautiful design finally succeeded in driving me away, after 20 years of fighting them to be able to purchase small quantities.<br /><br />I designed my first multi-axis motion controller in 1985, using five 6502s.  Each axis had a dedicated processor and the fifth one was for communications and program sequencing.<br /><br />The second generation design followed very quickly.  It was obvious that a single 6502 could service four axes of digital servo control without breaking a sweat and could also handle the system-level chores while leaving around 30% of capacity as performance margin.<br /><br />Very shortly afterward, I discovered that Mitsubishi was producing a microcontroller with a lovely set of on-board peripherals integrated extremely well with a 6502 core.  I don't know who was responsible for this superb integration, but it was beautifully melded with the 6502 architecture and retained the same direct and regular concepts of the 6502.  It was not only a pleasure to use, but it was implemented in CMOS and was offered in a version that could be clocked at 10 MHz.<br /><br />I was ecstatic until I learned that Mitsubishi hated small accounts even more so than Intel did.  Every step of the way from my first order in 1986 until my last in about 2004, I had to force them to sell to me.  They did not wan to sell me the chips, nor the assembler nor any support elements and certainly never provided any design support of any sort.  When Mitsubishi merged their microcontroller products under the name Renasas, they never informed me.  All I knew was that I was no longer able to buy the parts I needed to fulfill orders from my  customers.<br /><br />Eventually, I learned about Renasas and continued with them because to me, this was the most ideal circuit available on the market.<br /><br />There finally came a time when I gave up.  It was becoming almost impossible to be allowed to buy parts from Renasas and then only by ordering 2000-piece minimums and waiting months for delivery.  The last straw was when all the competition added on-board flash and oscillators and Renasas only offered such things on the M16, which was not 6502-based.<br /><br />Why should I continue fighting with a company like this when they would not support my beloved 6502?  So I began to evaluate the competition.  I won't go into the details of my selection, but I can say that if I had known that the highly trumpeted support for the Atmel AVR family did not truly exist, I might have chosen a different vehicle.<br /><br />As it is, I am stuck, for the moment, with a silly mnemonic structure in the assembly language that leaves me longing for the regularity of the 6502, and am no fan of the Harvard architecture that separates program, memory and I/O buses and certainly not of the lingering smell of the Intel 8051, but at least this design was performed by a group that had at least seen a real computer, as opposed to the 80xxx crap.</ul></ul><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8130">Garth</a> — Wed Oct 18, 2017 10:53 pm</p><hr />

CURSOR_POS will not get incremented here; but a CHR$(254) (þ) will do SET_LCD_ADR to the beginning of the 2nd line.<br /> ; Start with the low program-memory address byte of the string's 1st char, minus 1, in W.  This will go into TEMP_1 and be the<br /> ;   index to keep fetching the next byte of the string, incrementing TEMP_1 each time, until a 00 byte is read.<br /> ;

<div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Is the PIC16 also shoddier than the Intel 8080?<br /></div>Yes.<br /><br />As someone who has an almost irrational fondness of the 8-bit PIC family, it's pretty terrible.<br /><br />It's roughly comparable to the 8051, but with the big plus of both constant and very low interrupt latency compared to almost all other microcontrollers.<br /><br />There are 5 major groups in the 8-bit PICs:<br /><br />12-bit instruction word PICs, originating with the very first parts (PIC1640, PIC1650, &amp;c). A few of the &quot;PIC12xxx&quot; parts now. Intended to control <em>peripherals</em> on a CP1600-based (yes, the one from the Intellivision) computer. One pointer access port, eight other hardware definition registers, and 23 more bytes of RAM for 32 total &quot;first class&quot; addresses. Everything else has to be addressed indirectly (pointer register) or via banking. Usually only two entries in the call stack. Maximum program size without bankswitching is 9 bits→512 instructions. Doesn't always support interrupts.<br /><br />&quot;older&quot; 14-bit instruction word PICs. Usually &quot;PIC16xxx&quot; parts. Adds a real call stack (the 8-call deep that Garth was complaining about) as well as more bits for RAM (7 bits now, making 128 bytes). Its prettiest form is the PIC10F322, which is as much as you can fit without bankswitching. Maximum program size without bankswitching is 11 bits→2048 instructions.<br /><br />&quot;traditional&quot; 16-bit instruction word PICs. PIC18xxx. Three pointer registers, 9 bits for specifying 512 bytes of &quot;first class&quot; RAM, of which half is used as a dedicated access to the bankswitching interface and half is dedicated for an &quot;access&quot; bank providing faster access to the I/O registers and some RAM. Added a set of &quot;shadow registers&quot; such that interrupts wouldn't require saving or restoring the main thread's state. Maximum program size is 23 bits→8M instructions.<br /><br />These first three were designed to be <em>source</em>-level compatible; a PIC12F508 program could be reassembled for a PIC18F452 with very few (if any) changes.<br /><br />&quot;newer&quot; 14-bit instruction word PICs. Usually &quot;PIC16xxx&quot; parts. Adds a second pointer register, to increase the ease of targeting C to it. Moves the original fixed registers around so it's no longer source-level compatible. Started growing all sorts of fun peripherals. Also acquired shadow registers.<br /><br />&quot;extended&quot; 16-bit instruction word PICs. Supported alternate mode in all but the oldest PIC18xxx. Redefines the meaning of the 96 bytes of &quot;access bank&quot; to instead mean <em>pointer-relative</em>, i.e. for fast access of variables on a C stack.<br /><br />But, remember, the original design, and what it excels at, is <em>high speed first-class access to its own peripheral controls</em>. C compatibility is an afterthought, and it shows. But a native asm interrupt handler that can reliably do something in a constant 5 instruction cycles from the original event? Sure. And almost all instructions take the same amount of time to execute, so constant-time code is much more tenable.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Wed May 10, 2017 12:18 am</p><hr />

You know, you've suggested that the 8080/LR35902/Z80's poor complement of indexed addressing modes are some kind of fatal flaw a few times since that discussion; not to get into some kind of 8-bit instruction set holy war - I love the 6502 - but one could easily argue that the 6502's register paucity, or its huge number of obviously &quot;missing&quot; instructions (push and pull X or Y, for instance), or the aspects of its design that make it a poor target for C compilers are similarly debilitating. In practice, just as one learns to make effective use of the programming model of the 6502 (say, keeping a convention of storing temporaries on zero page, or <a href="http://wilsonminesco.com/stacks/" class="postlink">using the 6502's powerful addressing modes to implement a more flexible software stack</a>), so too does one learn to work with the Z80's strengths and limitations with things like structs-of-arrays rather than arrays-of-structs and page alignment. The comparison of the Z80 - a sophisticated-for-its-time general-purpose CPU that was selected over the 6502 for many computers and video game platforms throughout the 8-bit era - to a primitive microcontroller like the PIC16 (an 8-deep stack! my god! <a href="https://learn.mikroe.com/ebooks/picmicrocontrollersprogramminginassembly/chapter/instruction-set/" class="postlink">just look at this instruction set</a>!), just because it can be a little clumsy with random access on structs or non-page aligned arrays, is practically <em>offensive</em> <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />At any rate, to answer your question so as to make my response a constructive contribution to the topic at hand rather than just a rant, there's of course no precise definition of what makes an architecture &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; or not, but a couple of obvious things that make could make it feel less powerful or less ergonomic that come to mind are inconsistencies (different registers having different capabilities, for instance) or deficiencies that present roadblocks with no obvious workarounds (say, an incredibly shallow stack). In general, if across the range of problems you need to solve you need to spend a higher proportion of your time thinking about and writing code to work around the CPU  instead of dealing with the problem at hand, you'll get the impression that a CPU is &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;.<br /><br />Or, in even more general, a CPU is &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; if it makes your life difficult  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4826">adam_smasher</a> — Tue May 09, 2017 9:15 pm</p><hr />
