Some games didn't count on an NES controller making this possible and thus will gritch very weirdly when the user presses both simultaneously.<br /><br />Games I know of where this is an issue includes Battletoads and Zelda 2.<br /><br />&lt;/hunch&gt;</div>
<br />For the sake of accuracy, such a feature should be made optional. I seem to recall at least one game that had debugging features activated by pressing two or more directions simultaneously.
<br />
<br />This makes me wonder if any Japanese games mapped such features to Start or Select on controller 2, since a stock Famicom with hard-wired controllers doesn't have those buttons?

There's <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=711" class="postlink">a past discussion about this</a>, along with code to handle it more intelligently than "if left+right or up+down then report that no direction is pressed".

<br />
<br />I fixed a bunch of stuff up today. I even have MMC3 support with IRQs. IRQs were really easy to get working infact. Well really the whole MMC3 was a breeze. I thought people said it was supposed to be hard? Although I am not emulating the Scanline Counter exactly the way it would really behave (based on A12). 
<br />
<br />Anyawy I still have plenty of problems to deal with but I also have alot more games to play with now. =)

<br />Making fake MMC3 IRQs by counting scanlines is easy.  Doing it the real way with A12 is the hard part.
<br />I'm guessing that Kick Master will probably crash after you pick up the first item.
