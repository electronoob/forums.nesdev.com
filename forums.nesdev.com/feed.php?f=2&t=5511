Well, were I forced to push the project in one direction or another, I'd lean towards an LSDJ arrangement.  It's what I'm most comfortable with, personally, there is a large population out there that has gotten accustomed to it as well, and it's something that hasn't been brought over to the NES yet.<br /><br />I will add, though... to my non-coder mind, it seems it would be relatively easy to take a single chain, with, say, 8 phrases, all sixteen steps long, and display those note and effect values as a 128-step scrolling "classic" tracker view.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3746">atron</a> — Mon Sep 07, 2009 9:18 am</p><hr />

This reply is a little late, but..<br /><br />Yep now that you mention it, I remember using the EDx effect in FT2 (rarely).  And also I've used the Gxx effect in Famitracker.  But yeah you must be right about it being cumbersome with a different tempo, because I was doing some Iron Maiden covers and had a heck of a time.  It definitely didn't help that Famitracker at the time didn't use the Gxx until you made an NSF, but happily that's all fixed now.  One of the covers I didn't finish was "Phantom of the Opera", where nearly every note in every channel has a Gxx effect on it.  G01,G03,G05,G08??  That's a little bit tedious!  Sounded almost right, but almost doesn't quite cut it for an epic tune like that one.<br /><br />I can't think of any solution for a tracker where triplets wouldn't look strange in the editor, but I'd think it better to have something look stupid if it sounds right and is easier to edit.<br /><br />BTW if anyone happens to be curious about the Iron Maiden covers I did finish, they're here: <a href="http://2a03.free.fr/?p=pub&amp;dir=Memblers" class="postlink">http://2a03.free.fr/?p=pub&amp;dir=Memblers</a> (Afraid to Shoot Strangers, and The Ides of March).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat Sep 05, 2009 9:19 pm</p><hr />

I've never used LSDJ, but from look at some youtube vids of it, I don't see what makes it different from a tracker.  Except that the pattern length on a tracker is traditionally 64 lines, and seems to be 16 on LSDJ.  Am I missing something?  Guess I could try it out for myself, but not if I don't have to. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Personally I think 64-line patterns are a bit silly on NES, especially since most parts of songs don't have a unique series of 64 lines, they almost always repeat much sooner.  What also annoys me to no end, since I'd gotten better at composing stuff sometimes, is how it's stupidly hard to do triplets in a traditional kind of tracker setting.  And it also seems like there's no space-saving way to transpose short phrases, at least not on any NES trackers or even MCK that I can recall (would be a huge memory-saver for composers who care).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Aug 31, 2009 2:10 pm</p><hr />

I don't think having two separate interfaces is a good idea, it will make the tracker a lot harder to code.

In other words, the user can choose between the LSDJ song-&gt;chain-&gt;phrase method or just go with a down-scrolling feel. I prefer the LSDJ feel, as it's a bit easier for me to program loops, but there will be others out there who would prefer it the other way around.<br /><br />I would like DCPM and instrument tables placed on the far right, making 3 rows and 4 columns instead of 4 rows and 3 columns. Obviously if we had a classic/lsdj switch option some of these windows would need to rearrange.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3746">atron</a> — Wed Aug 19, 2009 12:47 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Honnestly, this is at least the 5th time someone come up like this promising paid jobs to us but they just left with no replies, I still havent heard of anyone being hired by them.<br /></div><br />There was one NES job I did and got paid fairly for, it was a small task though.  Unsurprisingly, most of these kind of jobs seem to devolve into requests for more difficult tasks for little pay, when the specs/requirements start to change after you start..  Of course I was probably guilty of overconfidence in all of those cases.  Actually this offer seems better, because a tracker/music editor is fairly complex already, but seems totally achievable.<br /><br />I'm a Fasttracker / Nerdtracker old-timer, but I've used MCK a little, Famitracker a little more, and some other more obscure synth and chip trackers.  Never touched LSDJ.<br /><br />Looking at my old dev files, back in 2003 I was working on my own native tracker.  I only made it as far as testing my format, and doing that on one channel only.  Like thefox said, I also was skeptical that anyone would want to use a native tracker.  Around that time I also made a speech synth with a native phoneme-based editor.  Also I've designed a synth chip as a sound expansion for an NES cart that desperately needs music editor support (a long time ago jsr said he'd support it, but I haven't shipped any hardware to anyone, so naturally it's still in obscurity).  So yeah, my background makes me quite interested in this project.<br /><br />I work full-time, so unfortunately it's not like I could work on something like this extensively on a daily basis.  I could do maybe 12 hours per week at the most.  But I definitely could use some money for my NESdev bank account (for my R&amp;D and production plans).  There's always very little left over from my day job paychecks, despite me being a cheap bastard. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />So yeah, if this job has a realistic goal (seems to be the case), but also realistic timeframe and compensation, then yeah I'd definitely be up for it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Aug 19, 2009 10:22 am</p><hr />

I'm a little bit interested but not sure about committing to a project like that. I have written my own tracker for Windows (Pornotracker) and of course 6502 replay code for it but haven't published it (yet).<br /><br />I have thought about making a native tracker but tbh didn't think anybody would actually want to use one. I think LSDJ is little bit different because it's on a portable machine.
