Your armor rating is the number of quarter-hearts that damage is reduced by. Just raising your armor by 4 means taking one less heart of damage from every hit.<br /><br />That said, elemental damage complicates things a little, and you can't remove damage entirely, because each enemy will always deal at least some amount of damage depending on their type.<br /><br />When it comes to Guardian lasers, they aren't just an automatic one-hit kill. With good armor, you can reduce their damage all the way down to 3.5 hearts per shot.

The guardians are relatively rare, and always placed in a way to guard off some areas that are &quot;intended&quot; (ie. guided into) late-game areas, such as Hyrule Castle, obviously. Aside from that, most places they show up, they are either very easy to avoid, or actually set up in a way that the game expects you to &quot;stealth&quot; your way around them rather than fight them - especially true for the flying ones.<br /><br />The question wasn't so much how you'd fight them, but why you'd bother with it.

It will keep you from fighting stuff (unless you have another backup and don't mind breaking the one you're using to control your body temperature - or in some cases just take in the cold while you're using another weapon), but it carried me very far into the game. I never bought the hot/cold armors until I had enough money for them anyway. Never had to grind for any rupees.

They're not just for the end, they're an important element across the whole game.<br /><br />At some point a traveller told me I could hit them in the eye, and that's when I realized I could stun them this way.<br /><br />I tried a few times to destroy one but ended up grinding all my weapons away in the process, and failed.<br /><br />Eventually on the way to the Akkala tech lab, there was a partially disabled one blocking my way to the lab. (I could sneak past, but I needed to light the torches, and it was making this difficult.) This one, because it had no legs and lower HP I actually managed to destroy. That was kind of a turning point for realizing that I could destroy them.<br /><br />Finally at the lab, with all those glowing blue weapons on sale, I started to wonder about my own collection of guardian weapons I'd picked up in the shrines. That's when I decided to try these on the guardians and realized I could take them on with these. This again was a realization and point of discovery that I really enjoyed.<br /><br />I didn't get the master sword until MUCH later, and I thought the continual encounters with guardians, with slowly increasing varieties of success was a lot of fun.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've got two sacred beasts Zora and Goron and I spent all my upgrades on Heart Containers except one on the Ganbari meter. There are plenty of strong enemies in the game and I seldom had much trouble climbing so I find hearts far more important. I met my first Guardian with legs in the Zora region and I couldn't beat it, then when I went to Death Mountain I was finally strong enough to beat a Guardian. They are still hard since I can only barely survive one hit with good armor but you can stun them, freeze them in time, cut their legs and stuff so they aren't that hard. Just as long as you have some somewhat strong weapons (I haven't seen any Master Swords yet) and are good with the bow, I don't find them too difficult anymore. I learned to dodge their beams on the plateau early in the game, although there's not much room for mistakes. Some fairies and Mifaa's skill really helps.<br /><br />Why fight the Guardians and Lynels when you can sneak around them? Because it's more fun to fight them IMHO. Early in the game you have no choice but to sneak around them which was very exciting on its own, but if I have a chance of winning I'll take the fight. This is really a great game far exceeding my expectations!<br /><br />I don't get what blue armor you got early? I bought all armor I could find in shops and the best I have so far in terms of defense is the knight armor in Hateno Village. Chugging potions works but I find it far less stressful to just use the fire proof armor in Death Mountain that you even get for free (well part of it) for doing a quest.<br /><br />There are tons of things to buy in shops so I think this is finally the first Zelda game since A link to the Past or possibly Links Awakening that actually got the economy right again. I always run out of arrows (unlike in other Zelda games where you can just cut some grass when you run out) and recently I gotten rich so I buy up most of the food stock in the shops (especially things that can only be found in the shops). I got plenty of rupees from just selling things I have too much of and it was enough to buy everything in the game so far and even a house, but I think I've probably been grinding more than most people do. Not intentionally though, I just find it fun to go around and explore and fight everything I meet, which got me plenty of items.

But I still had to sneak past them early on. Even if I would be able to dodge perfectly I would still probably run out of weapons (I tried fighting a Lynel early but quit when I realized that I was running out of weapons and died too many times).<br />I think they finally nailed the difficulty in battles for the first time in a 3D Zelda. It reminds me of Zelda 1 on the second quest where you have to go up into the Death Mountain very early in the game, and Lynels are way out of your league so you just have to try to avoid them. Or Death Mountain in Zelda 2 which are filled with strong enemies (like red Daira) that you might rather not want to fight at that point in the game if you can help it.

Usually there will be a guided way, but the game completely encourages creativity and going off the beaten path, something no Zelda games did before, with exception of the first one being kind of open to taking dungeons in &quot;any&quot; order.

Sometimes it fails and I'm forced to dodge the beam, sometimes that fails too and I'm forced to sacrifice a shield (unless I manage to reflect the beam). Having lots of weapons, shields, fairies and some special skills is usually enough to beat a few Guardians. I aim for their legs to immobilize them and break their shield field thingy. Then I try to tip them over and try to stab them from bellow. If I'm out of fairies I run though, too risky.<br /><br />Ancient weaponry are great if you have them, but I have only one of those anti-guardian arrows so I'm not using it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Sumez wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Lynels are super fun to fight, but you don't get a lot of chances to learn their movement patterns early on due to them practically one-shotting you.

But at least they are strong, in all other 3D Zeldas the fight usually goes like this: The enemy is slow and stupid so you hit him three times before he can do anything, he flies to the ground so you have to wait for him to get up then he falls after one or two additional hits. You can't even try out all the cool weapons and moves you got because they die too fast. Other enemies are either Octoroks that you have to shoot from afar or other weak enemies like Chuchu that falls in one or two hits and never really gives you a fight. The only strong enemies are the Knucks (Darknut, Iron Knuckle etc) but they are very rare usually only found in late-game dungeons. In BOW even Bokoblins are dangerous because they have more powerful attacks and they can usually take far more than three hits with an average sword before they fall.
