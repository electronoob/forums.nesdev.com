Nintendo explicitly forbids all ROMs on their legal site.<br />Forbidding emulators is however beyond their control because the patents have expired.<br /><br />Now I don't know what exactly is actually legal. Can you help me? Please correct me if there's some incorrect about what I said. I've seen Mario ROMs and Mario hacks and they are all so awesome and I don't want to throw them away because they're derivative work.

However, Nintendo has tended to look the other way at RomHacking.net because there are bigger legal fish to fry. Ideally, some of the ROM hackers would pool their efforts and create an original engine as a basis for total conversions instead of using SMB1, SMB3, and SMW all the time.

You should be able to find one online, or even in the yellow pages.  A good attorney will be willing to give you 15 minutes of their time to hear your questions and tell you whether or not you'd need to hire them (say, for an hour's worth of time) to get answers in full.<br /><br />* - Don't be tempted to be a smart ass and bring recursion into this (&quot;how can I trust what YOU say then!?&quot;)
