		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have just checked and it doesn't seem that the /WE and OE/ line goes anywhere on the type 1 board (romlabs version). They are connected to the separate 7-pin row at the bottom of the pcb but they are not making any connection with the willem adapter which must have something to do with the chip not programming or being ID properly. Where should I connect those line on the willem adapter?
<br />
<br />I made a homemade adapter with wire about 9 cm long running from the 36 pin socket (29f032) to the 32 pin header connecting in the willem following peccost's pcb design. Do you think the length could be causing the issue I am having? My willem is pcb v5.03. Sometime the chip appear to erase properly (giving me DQ7 success message) but then the blank test is unsuccessful following that erase session. The chip never send back a proper ID and display [----] and the manufacture code change from 0x00 to random one every once in a while.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I completely redid the adapter with connection shorter than 2 cm and even resoldered a new flash chip on a brand new pcb and made sure everything was perfect. Still nothing. I got one of my chip to id a few time yesterday but every time it would give back another id after and then no more correct id. Seem to erase but then fail blank check. Or it erase and give me success DQ7 within a few second which doesn't make sense. Then the willem software will suddenly give me an hardware error and ask to check power &amp; connection and start working again a few second later or 5 min later unless I remove the adapter.  I'm starting to believe there must be something wrong with the adapter as I saw people having exactly the same issue on a french forum (adapter were bought directly from the site). On the romlabs document for the willem adapter they list a 10nf cap and 2 2k2 resistor but it is nowhere on the Peccost design. I think that his adapter might work on some revision of the willem and not on other, that's the only logical thing I can think of. I'm started to think I wasted alot of money on flash chip for that project and I have wasted over 30 hour making different adapter and trying to find the issue so it is very frustrating. People interested in such a project should be warned.

<br />
<br />It works perfectly if you write the flash chip before and solder it afterwards!
<br />
<br />Though writing shouldn't be a problem because all the unused pins of the flash chip like _W, _RP and _RB are on the left side, you just need to use them correctly.
<br />
<br />I guess your adapter is broken or does not match, maybe you should read the datasheets.

<br />I bought 16 Type 2 boards, The first one I never got working.  I soldered 10 more, 8 work perfectly, one works sometimes, and another just spits back 0's.  All soldering is good, no shorts or breaks.  I believe it may be a defective board, which for $0.65/ea is a distinct possibility.

I'm getting obsess over getting it to work and I'm thinking of buying a proper adapter for my willem as I'm starting to lose trust in that diy adapter. Why would it work with no component at all when the official adapter use some? Even the one from romslabs got sone resistor and a capacitor, I'm sure there is a reason for that...

I checked my adapter and everything match up with peccost's design and checked with continuity tester. Either my adapter is not working with my willem or i have 5 bad chip in a row. Isn't there some with an extra pcb for the maskrom to willem adapter? My sanity is at stake not to mention loss of sleep (keep trying to fix it until late at night on work day:) ) i don't have the supply to make my own PCB, Peccost say he doesn't sell them and they're out of everything at the french website that seem to deal a lot with repro and 29f032 adapter. People that do repro and sell them are usually shy of sharing anything that might give their "super power" to other  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

<br />
<br />It look better in person though. The adapter look a bit ghetto but I tested all the contact with continuity tester. Also, I was thinking, isn't there a way to hack the willem software to add or modify a device's profile? It would be so easy to just change the 29f032 or add an extra device with the correct pin-out and address line for the maskrom adapter.

<br />
<br />Thanks a bunch for the offer, I'm getting crazy over this, not even because I have a super use for the flash chip but just because I'm get really annoyed and frustrated when something is not working like it should:) I redid one of the adapter again this time using my re flow gun (find it unpractical for that but worth a try), solder looked worse than my hand made job. I got full of hope when the chip id 2 or 3 time in a row, tried to erase the chip, it got done way too fast. Then it never gave correct ID since then.
