						<div class="postbody">My Super Famicom went on the fritz last night. While playing for a couple hours the colours started flickering, things like the coin logo at the beginning of Super Mario All Stars was a dark shade of orange not gold anymore red seemed to be a dominant colour. Blue was lacking in strength too.<br />I tried disconnecting the YPbPr connector and trying S-Video with no luck I also tried Composite with no luck. I guess my BA6594AF couldn't handle it and died, I never bothered to try any of the different circuits people had devised here because I had no issues with dull faded colours.<br /><br />I guess this could be a warning for those who have done the basic mod like I did to a BA6594AF encoder, it may not last. I know a couple of the guys over at Sega16 were trying to use these encoders for a component project and had a number of chips fail on them, so maybe they are sensitive.</div>

I might have to buy a Vita for that one.  Anyway, if you're still hanging around Chicago we should meet up and chat about console video mods.</div><br />Hiya Ste. Yeah, long time. Hey, I thought you were gonna help perfect the Red-Y/Blue-Y amp last time we chatted, no ??<br /><br />As for Celceta, if it's published here by XSEED Games in the future, then it's just auto-boycotted by me with zero consideration. Whatever they publish, I willed myself not to give a shit! I got tired of just trying to forget that I was cheated by them and my criminal translating partner, so now I just got a big ole boycott message on my website and I'm gonna recompile all of my Ys-related and other software to also throw up boycott messages in the future. Payback to the asshole employee (Tom &quot;wyrdwad&quot; Lipschultz) that orchestrated the deals to take the fan translation work and make sure that I was excluded. It's a loooong story... My translator ported the fan translated scripts, handed them over, took 100% credit/100% profit, and played stupid with me ever since for 3 years (since 2010) - that was after some 7-8 years of pretending to be my friend... Last June though, the weasel finally came out of hiding, but that was just to threaten a libel lawsuit with &quot;his lieyer...&quot; He &quot;lieyer'ed&quot; up, or so he claims... It's all a great story to tell the kids one day, that's for sure! Hahaha!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If you're more interested in mods, hear what NightWolve has to say.  He's a good guy and knows what he's doing.</div><br />Well, I appreciate that, but you're an actual electrical engineer, so you know a lot better than me! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> I can still call out some bullshit from what I have learned, at the very least.<br /><br />That's an interesting cable BTW, so you didn't ever try to mess with the Red-Y/Blue-Y pins off the S-ENC chip and use the ready-to-go Luma from the S-Video signal ? I don't remember you mentioning that you were planning this. I knew you were doing this for Genesis, though.<br /><br />I'm hoping for someone with formal EE training AND an actual SNES unit with the S-ENC chip to design a transistor-based amp pretty much in the style of what's already there for the other signals. That's why I made this:<br /><br /><img src="http://i237.photobucket.com/albums/ff216/Sephiroth1975/Tech/SNES-VideoSignalCircuits.jpg~original" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The new, previously unknown information is that they added a pull-down capacitor to match the one after the transistor. So if 200 uF was used to filter the DC offset after the transistor, a 200 uF pulldown cap is used right before the output heads for the TV. Nobody else caught that in any circuit dump that I have seen, so far at least. This was the result of having 2 spare SNES motherboards and tracing all components starting from the S-ENC pins to the output pins at the Multi-AV out, etc. I verified every component with my VC99 DMM which can measure capacitance as well. So resistance and capacitance values are exact based on the DMM except for the pico caps since it can NOT measure anything below 1nF/1000 pF. For that, I'm relying on what the SNES schematic says that they are, 10 or 220 pF, etc.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">kriskizlyk wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/download/file.php?id=851&amp;t=1" alt="Image" /></div><br />Pretty nice, so you can just go straight to HDMI with this <s>although you won&#39;t have full compatibility with every game.</s> Err, just read more about this machine; they say they aim for 100% compatibility, that possible ??

You can put another series source termination resistor on Y (driving another transmission line) and it will then be driving two 150 ohm loads (= 75 ohms). Whether the output (amplifier, whatever we're talking about at this point, I don't even remember) can drive a 75 ohm load or not I don't know.

The app engineer is concerned with &quot;designing&quot; the most economic output stage meeting whatever standards; they aren't concerned with making the most linear (faithful) video driver possible, as I'd hope you'd be if you knew better.

Large coupling capacitors have their uses when they're necessary. Technically you don't even need them in this app, they're left over from antiquated output stages to protect against shorts.

There's nothing magical about 75 Ohms where it somehow always has to be used in series in the output stage or as the &quot;proper&quot; pull down resistance or whatever else... The only place where that's true is on the input module of the signal receiving device, the TV in this case; when we say that the input impedance of your TV's Composite video jack is 75 ohms, what that translates to is that there is a solid 75 Ohm resistor connected on the female jack from + to ground, right there! So, as soon as you connect a cable, whatever cable, the TV's input module immediately grounds it with a 75 Ohm resistor! That's where the standard of 75 Ohms really comes into play!! </div><br />dude!!! that's only part of it!!!

What a waste of time to engage with you though, but arrogance like yours must be checkmated, I feel it a duty of mine for the good of the Internet!<br /><br />1) I examined one of my spare SNES motherboards again. The total pulldown resistance from the transistor emitter output for Luma/Y is <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>79 Ohms</strong></span> on the mark with my VC99 DMM which is known for good resistance measuring. So yes, two resistors in series, off to ground. The total resistance is 79 Ohms.<br />2) I chose a solid 80 Ohm resistor as that's what came in my 500 Resistor pack from RadioShack. I'm not a moron like you, that is, I'm not gonna tell people in Mod Guides to solder two 39 Ohm resistors together just to match this &quot;preferred value&quot; notion by <span style="text-decoration: underline">ONE F--KING OHM!!!!!!!!!!!</span><br />3) After it was exposed to you that SNES engineers used 78 (and now 79) Ohms, you should've STFU right then and there, and conceded your failed/selective points, but instead you arrogantly pressed on, crying about this &quot;preferred value&quot; notion. My actual resistor IS a preferred value by labeling, moron! It's unlikely that it can be anything else! F--KING MORON!!!!!!! So here's the link that you pasted:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_value#E_series">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_value#E_series</a><!-- m --><br /><br />E12 ( 10%): 10  12  15  18  22  27  33  39  47  56  68  <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>82</strong></span><br /><br />You see, troll, the actual stated value is 82 Ohms, a &quot;preferred value&quot; that you're so stuck-on-stupid about. My circuit guide shows 80 Ohms because I used my DMM and reported the ACTUAL resistance in-circuit, you know, REALITY. Resistors are usually lower than their stated values. Now since I never finished that guide, I didn't get a chance to add footnotes and mention that you'd be grabbing a 82 Ohm resistor from your 500 pack, and should measure it, find one that comes out about to 80 Ohm like mine, so that you get about the same results as I get. Honest enough of a thought-process.<br /><br />So here's the standard 500 resistor pack from RadioShack:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2994585">http://www.radioshack.com/product/index ... Id=2994585</a><!-- m --><br /><br />And part of the product description:<br />5 pcs: 2R2, 15R, 22R, 33R, 39R, 47R, 51R, 68R, <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>82R</strong></span>, 180R, 270R, 390R, 510R, 680R, 820R<br /><br />So no 75 Ohm resistor in between, they skip from 68 on to 82, so that 82 one is what you're gonna grab. I don't see 75 Ohm resistors sold at that store or elsewhere for whatever reason.<br /><br />Conclusion: You FAILED, troll! Have some humility! Check. Mate. The rest of your nonsensical/selective points are WORTHLESS! If SNES engineers used 79 Ohms for total pull down resistance, I'm up by one with 80 Ohms, so you crying like a lunatic about &quot;preferred values,&quot; wasting current, too low of a value, are things you can take up with SNES engineers. Or maybe, stop trying to act like you know better than them, moreover, stop trying to demand gaming fanboys without formal electrical engineering skills somehow do better than what actual SNES engineers did! You don't have credibility to me anyway, so I'm gonna trust SNES engineers and my other EE friend over the likes of a hopelessly arrogant, egomaniacal troll! Without question, your arrogance to me is breathtaking!<br /><br />How sad is it though with you just making a declaration that, &quot;Hey, I see 80 Ohms there, makes no sense!&quot; when it was just a labeled 82 Ohm resistor all along, and that you could've simply respectfully asked/probed instead of introducing yourself to me as an arrogant, uppity dick ??<br /><div class="quotetitle">kyuusaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">You think I've never seen a 470 uF AC coupling capacitor before?

Your shit doesn't check out, like I've been saying!<br /><br />Case in point, I knew your arrogance would get the better of you once again, so I measured EVERY damn resistor on that whole RCA module! To recap, we're talking about this:<br /><img src="http://i237.photobucket.com/albums/ff216/Sephiroth1975/Tech/RCA_DVDOutputModule.jpg~original" alt="Image" /><br />Your arrogant ass claims there's gotta be a 75 Ohm resistor on there somewhere. You sure about that, boy genius ?? You sure ?? Cause out of disgust and betting that you'd be wrong ONCE AGAIN, I took my DMM and measured EVERY LAST RESISTOR on that module! That's right, every last one! Another bit of wasted time on you that I'll never get back! And guess what ?? You know the answer, YOU FAILED ONCE AGAIN!<br /><br />There were: 15, 100, 220, 10k, etc. BUT NOT A SINGLE 75 Ohm resistor!!! Check. Mate.<br /><div class="quotetitle">kyuusaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Which as I said marginally attenuates Pb and Pr, and serves no apparent purpose whatsoever. </div>What kind of an arrogant, ignorant lunatic are you ?? &quot;No apparent purpose whatsoever?&quot;<br /><br />The Red-Y off the transistor is TOO HOT moron!! You clearly are lacking in hands on experience to be making these types of definitive and thus arrogant statements! Do you understand how the process works ? You first set your TV to its defaults: color 32, tint: 32, contrast: max, brightness: 32, etc. After setting up the circuit and plugging it in, you play around with the output resistance. If you connect the emitter of the transistor directly to the TV, the color level is going to be TOO HOT! 15 Ohms of resistance HAPPENED to be good enough in my case to bring the color level down and stop the excess color saturation/bleeding (<em>whatever you call it when the color level is turned up too high!</em>) YOU F--KING MORON!<br /><br />Listening and arguing with your sorry, arrogant, ignorant ass is what serves no purpose, damn troll!!!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">kyuusaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">NightWolve wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">you threw in Pasky's desire to add about 15 Ohms of resistance to the native Luma output, yet his desire to do so, once again, has NOTHING to do with a competent, Red-Y/Blue-Y amplifier circuit!</div>What?

A proper series 75 ohm termination would attenuate the level to 40 IRE which would really break things.</div><br />How the f--k did the Red-Y/Blue-Y signals which are wired/prepped to be fed back into a custom video chip correctly go from NOT being compliant to &quot;already compliant&quot; in the same damn post, you schizophrenic, sloppy moron ?? That only makes sense to me if you were referring to Luma/Y, Pasky's messing with it, and his coincidental choice in also using 15 Ohms!<br /><br />Anyway, I already answered the choice in 15 Ohms after amplification. 39 Ohms, like the native Luma/Y is too much! 15 Ohms was good enough for the Red-Y on my particular 32&quot; CRT Television set. No resistor and you get excess color saturation/bleeding at the factory default settings because the signal is too strong, as I said.<br /><br />Really, look at what this moron is saying, the implication: you'd have to raise the power on the transistor so that the final series resistor can be 75 Ohms!<br /><br />Take the native Luma/Y circuit, at 5 Volts, you need about 39 Ohms of output resistance to get the picture just about proper on a TV's default settings. That's what SNES engineers did, their tweaking found 39 Ohms was good enough for most TV sets connected with their S-Video cable.<br /><br />So, what would you have to do to swap 39 for 75 ?? Raise the power on the transistor so that the amplified signal gets stronger (<em>or add a 2nd transistor if that works, double amplification, not that it'll work!</em>) and you therefore need more attenuation before sending it off to the TV. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Why the f--k should I have to do that ??</span> The f--king guy thinks he's slick, won't admit that he's wrong on anything!!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">kyuusaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">dude!!! that's only part of it!!!

Your insistence on a 75 Ohm resistor in series for the output just simply means I'd need a stronger source to attenuate and all I can see that would be needed to accomplish that is increasing the power to the transistor and hope the thing will amplify the source signal even more... Why the f--k is that gonna change anything ?? More power on the left, higher resistance value on the right. The way that DVD module worked, they amplified it just right where no output resistor was needed/used.<br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />Good job killing the thread! I see months later, nobody cared to participate further and I know who I blame!</div>

						<div class="postbody">I just happened to read the second half of this thread (haven't read any of it before) and it's pretty sad. It reminds me of the people trying to make a perfect NES palette without realizing that they are each shooting at a different target. People would post that they've finally figured it out, but it would never be just right.<br /><br />In this thread, I'm pretty sure that the circuits used are defective in many ways. Some of them have to do with being out of spec, and others have to do with depending on the particulars of their systems and components (every component of some part number differs, e.g. hFE of a transistor, and it's easy to accidentally depend on a particular component's value of this varying parameter).<br /><br />It's especially sad because some people more knowledgable have given hints about things that are unnecessary or counter-productive, but these haven't been followed. Pretty quickly it became clear that I was watching a miniature version of pre-scientific human psychology, where unfounded beliefs are constantly formed. It's similar to superstitions, and comical when it's not so damaging to people's goals. A good dose of the scientific method is needed here to weed out all the false beliefs people have formed in this thread.<br /><br />I have a specific question for the person who measured all the component values to map out the SNES video output circuitry (which BTW is a very good step to become more grounded in realiy). Did you desolder the components before measuring, or just measure them as soldered in the circuit?</div>

I'll do a condensed version. <br /><br />A) Here's what the heckling heckler kept heckling me about, the concept of &quot;preferred values:&quot;<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_value#E_series">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_value#E_series</a><!-- m --><br />E12 ( 10%): 10 12 15 18 22 27 33 39 47 56 68 <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>82</strong></span><br /><br />B) Now here's a standard 500 resistor pack I bought from RadioShack and part of the description:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2994585">http://www.radioshack.com/product/index ... Id=2994585</a><!-- m --><br />5 pcs: 2R2, 15R, 22R, 33R, 39R, 47R, 51R, 68R, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">82R</span></strong>, 180R, 270R, 390R, 510R, 680R, 820R<br /><br />Hmmmmmmmmmmmm... So to recap:<br /><br />1) The heckling heckler sees 80 Ohms on my schematic, goes apeshit cause he can't process how it's not 82 or 68 or 75 or 100, that is, it's not exactly what the labeling of the resistor states. A simple misunderstanding that could've easily been corrected, but the guy is a rottweiler, grabs on to a technicality type issue and won't let go!!! Deliberately just looking for ANYTHING he could find wrong to continue on with his bullshit!<br />2) It appears that this &quot;preferred value&quot; standard guides the industry on the production of resistor packs. So how the f--k could an Average Joe like me have gotten a hold of resistors that do NOT follow this standard anyway ?? Just a common sense question for the heckler.<br />3) I tell the heckling heckler that after doing a full circuit dump of all video amp circuits, SNES engineers achieved a 78-79 Ohm pull down resistance for the same situation when it comes to the Luma/Y amp and in doing the test again, it's fully <span style="text-decoration: underline">79 Ohms</span>. So, <span style="text-decoration: underline">80 - 79, a difference of ONE F--KING OHM!</span> But the heckler presses on ahead: &quot;<em>NOOOOOOO. OH. MY. GAWWD. You're still doing it wrong!!! It's not a 'preferred value' this 80 of yours!!!!!! WRONG I SAY!!! WRONG!!!!!</em>&quot;<br />4) In a schizophrenic fashion, in one post, he can be found telling you that 80 Ohms wastes loads of current, is too small, etc. but then in another post, he can be found telling you that you should've gone lower to 75 Ohms to conform to the 75 Ohm standard, etc. Make up your damn mind, heckler! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> <br />5) Again, if ROHM/SNES engineers, who designed the whole system, used 79 Ohms as the pull down resistance for the Luma/Y amp, and I used an 80 Ohm resistor for the Red/Blue-Y amp, I'm IN THE F--KING BALLPARK FOR F--K'S SAKE!<br />6) Yes, I didn't get to add footnotes in that Guide, but then I wasn't the one that released it here. I made it privately very quickly for ConHuevos, the guy that posted it here. It was just to show him what I did and got working. Clearly, cause of this heckling heckler's madness, I have to point out in detail that you're grabbing a 82 Ohm resistor from your pack, and that it typically will read 80 Ohms when properly tested under a good DMM.</div>
