If phpBB is broken, there's no reason we should stuck with it.  I've added a few mods and patches to it before, and usually that involved editing a lot of files manually and was generally a pain.  I'd be glad to see it go, but I can't imagine that everyone really wants to move now.</div>
<br />
<br />This is how I feel a little bit. It is a solution but it seems a little bit extreme. It could fix the spam problem but it may create some too:
<br />
<br />- You have to re-create your account (I guess). What happen if an old member's account from a user that is not active at the moment is taken over by a new user?
<br />- You cannot import the content 100% because it's a custom solution
<br />- You cannot continue existing threads
<br />- The community could becomes fragmented
<br />
<br />etc
<br />
<br />It's a nice solution but not the appropriate one but at least your intentions are good like I said.
<br />
<br />Some time we have to figure out how to fix the current issue and not "tearing the house down" just because it seems the easiest solution.  There is always consequences to restart from the ground up.
<br />
<br />This is my person opinion, people don't have to agree with it.
<br />
<br />By the way Membler, who can update that main page?  "Updated in 2005" seems so wrong. We should update that page more often. This is how we find the forum and everything, it should be more active than that.

<br />Not only that, but I'm not really sure you can forge $_SERVER[REMOTE_ADDR].

<br />With time and access, this could all be solved.
<br />
<br />For "taken over", I haven't ever encountered it being a serious problem. Those who do have it happen (on <em>rare</em> occasions) are usually revealed by others or forced to have a name change.
<br />
<br />
<br />I know that moves can be fragmenting (as I said, I've observed it several times, none of which were planned). But as long as it's a smooth and well-handled transition, it can go well.
<br />
<br />As I said prior, I think it would be nice to move somewhere where the administration is actually active more often than once every few weeks, but...

<br />----------------------------------------
<br />
<br />I believe Tor also has a way to test for its exit points.
<br />
<br />I see your point though. It's better not to get into an unwinnable game of cat and mouse. Just raise the difficulty of registration, eg ~24 hour delay before a moderator manually approves a new account. Eg annoy them away.
<br />
<br />Honestly though, at least the spam posts are <em>somewhat</em> comprehensible. Which is more than I can say for certain <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3449" class="postlink">other accounts</a> here ...

<br />The problem is, as Xkeeper mentioned before, the only link to the forums from the main page is practically invisible. Most legitimate new members likely find them via either a Google search or a link from another site. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />At the very least, you should add a note to the main page stating that it's basically an archive, and provide visible links to both the forums and the wiki.

<br />
<br />I see how you feel about it.  
<br />
<br />Maybe you should ask someone to maintain the main page and give it back to you for the updating it? That way you don't have to worry about html coding and content, just the uploading and approval part.

<br />At least jargon managed to find us.
<br />
<br />And yeah the main page should be updated. Just all dead links (re)moved (that's about 80% of the links over there), and new links added to recent releases in NESdev communauty, especially the wiki and the bootgod database.

<br />Great to hear that we have some volunteer to update the main page.
<br />
<br />I understand how you feel.  If you have a full time job and a family, it's hard to put time for your hobbies.  I'm lucky when I can put 1h per day on it!  
<br />
<br />If there a small thing I can help with, I'll be more than happy to do it. But my time is limited too.
