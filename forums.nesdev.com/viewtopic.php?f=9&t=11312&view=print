		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello all! I wish to gain some help from you guys.<br /><br />I will give you a rundown of what I want to accomplish:<br /><br />I want to interface with the SNES cart reader and send it ROMs from my laptop. Now before this turns into a shit throwing fight here, I am bored of doing memory hacks on an emulator and <span style="text-decoration: underline">wish to modify the real thing</span>.<br /><br />I understand that its not as easy as wiring the 62 pinouts to a USB cable (don't we all wish it was that easy?). From my understanding I will have to build a custom board which will convert a signal from the laptop to the SNES cart reader in a manor which will trick the SNES into thinking it is a cart. This is area I need most help with since I have access to a friend who can help me with the programming aspect. <br /><br />So, I want to be able to send files to the SNES and make it think there is a cart plugged in when it is actually my laptop. Idea behind this is that if the SNES thinks a cart is plugged in <span style="text-decoration: underline">it will give any programs I send to it memory permissions</span> (which is essentially my goal here, to modify/freeze memory values similar to doing that with an emulator). <br /><br />I do not want to flash my own cart since that would not allow me to change memory values of the program when it is running and would force me to hard code hacks into the EPROM (fuck that).<br /><br />As a side note, I was also thinking of finding JTAG ports in order to read what is on the memory. So using a combo of my laptop to send data to the SNES and using the JTAG port to read the data on the DRAM I will effectively have some type of ghetto debugger.<br /><br />To make it short and sweet, I want to use my laptop to send programs to the SNES and do hacks on it. <strong>I understand this may require several months to accomplish</strong>, however I am willing to follow advice and gain whatever knowledge and experience I need to accomplish this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You'd have to get the CPU to execute your code at a time that doesn't interfere with the game's execution.<br /><br />Essentially what you're trying to build is the Pro Action Replay accessory. It intercepts calls to the NMI vector, which gets called 60 times per second (once at the start of each vertical blanking period). When NMI occurs, the accessory somehow intercepts the vector and calls code that interacts with the RAM.

I am unaware of the common understanding of how people go about modifying the behavior of the SNES. I have misguided conceptions that need direction. From my understanding people flash their own carts. To what extent that allows me to read/write to the SNES is beyond my understanding.<br /><br />I am trying to build a loader that can upload programs to the SNES. I understand what I am describing here is the function of the cart, however I wish to change the memory of the SNES in real time. My conception is that I need a board which interfaces with the cart reader, acting as an intermediate between the physical SNES cat reader pin outs and a computer which can 'communicate' with it. <br /><br />If I am able to achieve this and upload my own programs, could I then write arbitrary code which the SNES would execute?<br /><br />My ideas might come across as being unrealistic. Once again please bare with me here: I am reaching to understand how hardware in general works and need guidance.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Your hardware will need to detect reads from $00FFEA, $00FFFA, and $00FFFC (native NMI, 6502 NMI, and reset), and have such reads toggle a switch between enabling the cartridge and enabling your piggyback board. When NMI occurs, the CPU will push flags and the return address and then read $00FFEA-$00FFEB. This will trigger a switch to a program on your piggyback board, which pushes all registers to the stack, does what it wants with the RAM at $7E0000-$7FFFFF, pops registers, and chains to the game's own NMI handler using JMP ($FFEA). This causes a second read of $00FFEA, which switches the cart back in.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The cartridge port isn't going to allow you to read or see the 128KB of RAM in real time. What I think tepples suggests is a device that would basically take over cpu control temporarily to dump the contents of RAM. But this would not come even close to matching an emulator with a debugger which can set break points or watch an area of RAM in real time. <br /><br />The real system will always have limits for debugging that the emulators will not. The emulator can stop execution at any time and tell you exactly what the state of everything is. On real hardware it's impossible to fully save the state of everything and you definitely can't freeze everything. <br /><br />Another thing that would help would be to give some examples of what you hope the device you want would allow you to do.
