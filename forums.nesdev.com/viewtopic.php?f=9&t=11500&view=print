		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I recently got a broken famicom from japan and i was able to fix it and mod it to  output Composite Video (added a MultiAV socket so I can just replug the cable from SNES).<br />Now, I also got a converter for playing normal NES game (72 pin) on Famicom and everything seems to work just fine. But when I plug in my N8 Nes Version into the adapter, it would not boot up when an SD card is inserted, only a green(/grey/red/whatever color) screen.<br />but it shows an error screen if there is no SD Card inserted. the self test is also accessible and it does error on SPI when no SD is inserted, i can acutally insert the SD card after i see the error message and do the self test, then it says SPI is ok (so sd card has no issues). the everdrive itself seems to have no issues because i can use it on both my PAL and NTSC NES.<br /><br />I googled a bit and found something that might be the solution: it says that mapper file 255.RBF was changed since OS v4 and someone else who had similar problems got it working by replacing said file with the mapper file from OS version s3m5.<br /><br />So my question is: will this really fix it? is anyone able to supply me with the firmware files from version s3m5? i am not able to find the file anymore on the internet and krikkz seems to have taken this version down from the firmware page.<br /><br />I would appreciate any help

I meant the computer at home running windows accessible and accessed by all members of the familiy, not the family computer by nintendo <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br />The problem is not solved, but it does not seem like anyone could help...
