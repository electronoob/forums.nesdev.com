I think bunnyboy may have deprioritized notifying forums.nesdev.com because of the way our ROM link policy has meshed with the hacked FDS BIOS he distributes with the PowerPak mapper package.

Well, I'm interested, but this probably won't be cheap and bunnyboy doesn't take any measures to help reduce import taxes charged on his products, so I probably won't be getting one anyway. Has he talked prices yet?

It is the main reason why I shut down so much of the website and don't have time for other projects. The add on board could still happen using what I have developed but certainly not during 2014. It hit problems in Feb that made certain TV not work. It was essentially done, unless you had a Samsung. Rather than spending the time to fix that I moved onto the real project: <br /><br />It is a clone that uses an FPGA to run the whole system, no software emulators or NOAC. Includes NES and Famicom slots, they are the same thing. Other cool stuff like Game Genie and Scoreboard built in. <br />It has 5 control ports with built in Four Score plus the Famicom expansion port. <br />It can run HDMI out for HD quality video, CD quality audio, and no frame buffers that add lag. Other than the expansion audio input from the cart there is no analog in the system. <br />It will be released some day at least 6 months from now. Fabrication and shipping takes 3 months alone! <br /><strong>It will cost money to buy, hopefully less than $150</strong>. <br />(thanks Mark!) <br /><br />There will be the obvious comparisons to Retron 5 but I see them very different. I will never be able to compete on price against a large company with chinese factories and retail connections, so that alone makes the target market different. I am aiming for the smaller group that can tell when a clone has issues, instead of the mass who can't tell or don't notice and aren't thinking about quality. The people who want to use obscure controllers, original equipment, and play new homebrews. Even the styling is designed to remind you of the system you love. It certainly isn't insulting to me if you pick the Retron 5, their system will do well and sell lots. This system just has a different mentality from the start. <br /><br />Mine is a huge financial gamble for me that is still scary... </div><br /><br />Source: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?StartRow=501&amp;catid=7&amp;threadid=92557">http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/messag ... adid=92557</a><!-- m -->

Maybe I can have him send it to someone in the US who will ship it to me in way that helps me (<a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=10596" class="postlink">unlike the PS4</a>, this console sounds like something I'd like to own!).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Movax12 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">While those that make the rules determine what right and wrong, I still think that is wrong.</div><br />I completely agree with you. There are laws I consider unfair, and if breaking them is unlikely to result in any serious penalty and doesn't cause trouble to anyone (a corrupt government that already has a shitload of money doesn't count), I'm willing to do it.
