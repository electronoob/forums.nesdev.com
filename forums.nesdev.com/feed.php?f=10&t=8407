There were some bytes changed from the original Rockman rom in the patch where I could not find the corresponding bytes in the (E) rom. So I didn't make those changes at all. It <em>seems</em> to work fine, but I have done very little testing.<br /><br />Should you encounter a bug/crash, what would be really helpful is a Nintendulator movie file that does all the necessary actions to cause the crash. Then I can probably find those bytes in the (E) rom, and hopefully it will work then or I'll be stumped.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Sun Jan 22, 2012 8:06 pm</p><hr />

If that's to me, probably not anytime soon like I said earlier. The stars were aligned perfectly for you when I ported the patch. I had nothing to do, was frustrated with my game but still wanted to code, and couldn't sleep.<br /><br />It's not hard, just time consuming. Detailed instructions in case anyone else feels like trying:<br /><br />Compare patched jp rom to unpatched jp rom. Find what was changed. I used a program for this. Alternatively, just learn the IPS file format which will tell you exactly what was changed and where.<br /><br />Say this string of bytes at $0100<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">$40 $50 $30 $51 $80 $87;&#40;not real code obviously&#41;<br /></div><br />was changed to this <br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">$30 $80 $80 $51 $80 $87;&#40;Not real code&#41;<br /></div><br />You search for that EXACT unchanged string in the Megaman Pal rom. (Make sure to put enough of the byte stream that there is exactly one result. Also, don't worry if it's in a slightly different location.) If it is identical for all the bytes that were changed in the jp rom, change those bytes to the ones in the patched jp rom. If you cannot find an identical string in the PAL rom,  you'll need to do the reset vector update and compare debug logging as described below.<br /><br />Do this for all changes made by the patch. <br /><br />Then run the patched jp rom in Nintendulator's debugger. Step, and reset. The first address is the reset vector. Search for the byte stream starting there. <br /><br />Then try to find that byte stream it in the PAL rom. Replace the reset vector's address to the address of that byte stream.<br /><br />If all goes well, it'll just work. If not, run the patched JP rom in PAL mode. Run the PAL rom in PAL mode. Log both from reset for around two frames. <br /><br />Compare the debug output. The code run should be more or less identical. If the patched PAL rom, ends up someplace with a lot of breaks, look at the patched jp rom's output. Look for what should have happened. Search for the byte stream where it should have ended up. Fix the address in the PAL rom, or fix what it was supposed to do right before.<br /><br />I don't remember ever having to do that for the MM2 rom, but in case you need it, it's there.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Tue Jan 03, 2012 4:18 pm</p><hr />

Yes there is crazy buggy screen split during the last boss, but I'm pretty sure those were fixed in the REV-A version of the game.<br />I think the common Mega Man 3 (E) rom floating arround comes from the (PRG1) / REV-A version of the game, but the cart I have is a (PRG0) game with the bug.<br /><br />Also, if you play Mega Man 6 (U) on a PAL NES, there will be several bugs, such as the sun in Tomahawk Man's stage not staying in place as it's supposed to.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Dec 22, 2011 10:24 am</p><hr />

Thank you so much for all the work! I'm testing it now and it seems okay, but I want to test it more. <br />My primary goal is indeed planting Megaman 1 and 2 in the Rockman6-in-1 multicart (check this topic: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=8426">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=8426</a><!-- m --> ). I have succesfully exchanged Rockman 3,4,5 with Megaman (E) 3,4,5 and inserted the Megaman 6 (U) instead of Rockman 6 too (since there is no Megaman 6 for PAL). I changed the ROM header to PAL and now I'm missing only Megaman 1 and 2 (E) to have complete Megaman6in-1(E). Well now I'm missing only Megaman 1!!! Fantastic! <br />After hat I'm planning to create such a multicart, that is, when I succesfully find out the hardware part that is being examined in the topic I posted.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4580">jpx72</a> — Thu Dec 22, 2011 3:47 am</p><hr />

I can compare two files in hexeditor but I can only notice the differences, I can't do anything about them.

There's a really slick program called <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/" class="postlink">Beyond Compare</a> that does a really excellent job of finding similarities and differences in files. I use it when I dabble in rom hacking.<br /><br />You can check the original (J) rom to the PAL rom, to see how much you'll have to change in the patch. If the data that is to be patched is the same code but in a different place, beyond compare will find it. And then it is (possibly) easy. (But probably not)<br /><br />I may try to do this after I get some sleep (like... right now). But if it looks like tons of work, you're on your own. You're on your own for testing either way.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Tue Dec 20, 2011 5:51 am</p><hr />
