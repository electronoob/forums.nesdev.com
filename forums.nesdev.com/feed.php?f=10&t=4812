The main reason i prefer anything beside NESASM is the banking system that is meant to be used for PCEngine (TG-16)  development.<br /><br />You see, despite the name, NESASM is just a modified assembler for the TurboGrafx-16.<br /><br />Obviously there is no reason to completely slight the program, but it wont run in a 64bit environment.<br /><br />I prefer ASM6. It has all the features of the more robust 6502 assemblers (like unnamed labels,) is open source (no OS limitations,) and allows some neat tricks (like embedding the header into the project, and .including the Sprite and background tiles onto the end, instead of concatenating the files.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3524">Compton</a> — Sat Mar 14, 2009 9:16 pm</p><hr />

Oh, I understand why you'd want a program to output .db statements. It's a lot easier to edit values with them. And plus, you can arrange them like:<br /><br />.db $32,$66<br />.db $44<br />.db $2F, $3F, $90<br /><br />So it's not like it is in a hex editor where it's just a sea of hex digits. I made a program a while back that output .db statements which held results of math functions for my sound engine. This may have been because I don't quite have the knowledge to make programs that save data to files (I'm pretty much a noob when it comes to file interaction).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Feb 01, 2009 12:03 am</p><hr />
