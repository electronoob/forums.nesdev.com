<br />
<br />First of all, It is now too expensive for buying it, That means it costs US $3,400 plus shipping... I do NOT approve of gigantic prices...
<br />
<br />Second is an alternative... Porting it to a free language such as C, so that it can use your own choice of dependancies, as well as being cross-platform.
<br />
<br />#2 is the great choice for Screen Tool, But the thing is I cannot program C or CPP. so as a note to Shiru, Please port it to some other free language.
<br />
<br />Sorry for this, I am being anxious.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I use C++ Builder for two reasons: I know it well and use for 10 years now, and I have a free license, the Turbo C++ cut down version.
<br />
<br />My choice of C++ Builder over a free software is because it allows me to do the job very fast, i.e. makes it doable in general. Sorry, I don't have time to learn a free GUI lib like Qt or GTK to a level comparable with my experience with VCL, and from what I know about these, it'll take much longer than with VCL anyway (because they are just libs, not RAD tools).
<br />
<br />I'm agree that there is major problem with it being not free and not crossplatform. Also, it is a real pity that they removed the free version and that it is overpriced so much. But I can't do anything with it. For my projects, either it will be that way, or console and SDL-based tools only (people don't like these), or nothing at all.
<br />
<br />
<br />Actually, this problem arises often with large scale hobbyist projects. Take FamiTracker, for example - a great project, but you can't build it without buying Visual Studio, because the free version does not have MFC, and even if you'll hook the one from the Platform SDK, it won't work (old version there).

<br />
<br />I did, Requesting other platforms such as SNES, GB/GBC and Sega 8-bits will not happen according to Shiru, and I will simply not do such again...

<br />Yeah, way back we talked to jsr about helping him port FamiTracker to Qt.  He wasn't interested in helping but gave blessing for it to be done.  I might get excited about it again soon and actually do it...but for now it's died on the vine.  Not enough time.
<br />
<br />Porting to Qt from something else isn't that bad.  Ok, it's almost like starting over...but I did it for my IDE, so it can't be horrifyingly hard!  
<br />
<br />I originally felt exactly the same way about VS/MFC...I know it...it's easy for me...why would I want to switch?

<br />These nametable selection types from consoles can be used as modes, and it still can be easy to replace NES to a different mode and back
