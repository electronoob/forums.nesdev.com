<br />
<br />I was looking at the headers of the nintendo test carts and they say
<br />they are only 16k of PRG data but all the photos I've seen of the test
<br />carts show both PRG and CHR chips on the PCBs? Is there something
<br />I need to edit on the header to get it to display the true hardware compatible info? I ask as I want to split the file for use on real hardware.
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />
<br />Shawn

<br />
<br />Ah I didn't notice that. All I saw was the chip said CHR and didn't see it was actually ram. So just slap in 8k of SRAM on the nrom CHR side and it's good to go then I assume?

<br />Kinda... The CHR write signal isn't connected to the CHR chip in NROM boards. You have to find out which cartridge pin it is (if there's no pin you'll have to improvise one by attaching a very thin piece of metal) and connect it to the RAM chip.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Ninja'd!

<br />
<br />That is what I assumed originally. Could you post the correct checksum of the service center test cart binary you fefer too please? Doesn't matter what test cart (joystick, power pad,ect) as I'm just experimenting with the hardware trying out all different types of cartridges and configurations and making a functional cartridge from the binary is my only goal not the content of the cart.

<br />
<br />All the pins are presant on the edge of the PCB so I should be good if in fact it does use ram as you suspect and I have to enable the write line.

<br />I don't really "suspect" anything, I was just assuming the header was correct, in which case the program would use CHR-RAM. But since Memblers appears to know the programs you are talking about it would be wise to trust him. =)
<br />
<br />But if you ever want to turn a CHR-ROM cart into a CHR-RAM one, a PCB with all the pins on the edge is indeed ideal. A lot of MMC3 boards, for example, don't have pin 56, which is the CHR write signal.
