So it's kind of interesting to remember what led me to NesDev in the first place.<br /><br />I have been following the TASVideos publications since 2008. I knew homebrew only a little bit since I bought a copy of <em>Battle Kid: Fortress of Peril</em> but I was focused on learning PC programing at that time so I didn't look much into it. Then in 2013 <a href="http://tasvideos.org/2326M.html" class="postlink">The TASVideos run of Streemerz</a> was published. At first I was kind of confused about whatever or not Streemerz was an older game. It seemed to be related to action52 but the game quality was way beyond that infamous package. So a bit of link following and internet searching revealed that the <a href="http://www.infiniteneslives.com/action53.php" class="postlink">Streemerz Bundle</a> was being sold. So I quickly got that, and then proceeded to binge read the NesDev forums.<br /><br />I had once seen the existence of NesDev in 2000 where the only things I remembered was the NSF file format and 6502.txt, but the fact that another programing compo that led to physical cartridges was just around the corner of 2014 was the biggest factor that led to me signing up here.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6385">JRoatch</a> — Sun Mar 27, 2016 12:10 am</p><hr />

People could use that to do several things that undermine any console maker's business model:<br /><ul><li><strong>Unlicensed games:</strong> Make and distribute working games for your console without paying your developer tax. The generally low quality of unlicensed games tends to reduce the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value" class="postlink">expected</a> quality of a randomly chosen game for a console. </li><li><strong>Emulation of pirated previous-generation games:</strong> Run illegal copies of the first party's back catalog (such as through FCE Ultra GX). This unfairly competes with current-generation sequels and with official rereleases through services such as Virtual Console. </li><li><strong>Cloning:</strong> Run illegal workalikes of your licensed developers' games, such as the various <em>Tetris</em> reimplementations used as Hello World on newly cracked consoles. </li><li><strong>Modding:</strong> Make and distribute new levels for an existing licensed game. These are considered derivative sequels per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Star_v._FormGen_Inc." class="postlink"><em>Micro Star v. FormGen</em></a>, and they unfairly compete with a game publisher's own paid DLC and sequels. </li><li><strong>Achievements/Trophies:</strong> Even an ostensibly single-player game is &quot;a competitive game&quot; on the console's built-in social network nowadays. </li></ul><br />Nintendo complained in court about Game Genie but lost on a technicality: because the device lacked ability to save codes, the modifications were not considered &quot;fixed&quot; and thus not derivative works. <em>Galoob v. Nintendo</em>.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Mar 21, 2016 8:25 am</p><hr />
