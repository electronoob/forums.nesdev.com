Polysilicon marked as purple, missing pieces marked as cyan.<br /><br />As result decimal carry circuit and decimal-correction adders do not work.<br />Therefore, the embedded processor of 2A03 always considers add/sub operands as binary numbers, even if the D flag is set.<br /><br /><a href="http://breaknes.com/files/APU/2A03_6502_diff.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://breaknes.com/files/APU/2A03_6502_diff_sm.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br />(clickable)<br /><br />PSD source : <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://breaknes.com/files/APU/core.zip">http://breaknes.com/files/APU/core.zip</a><!-- m --> [155 MB]<br />Podcast (russian) : <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://youtu.be/Gmi1DgysGR0">http://youtu.be/Gmi1DgysGR0</a><!-- m --><br />6502 schematics : <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://breaknes.com/files/6502/6502.jpg">http://breaknes.com/files/6502/6502.jpg</a><!-- m -->

We looked at where we had the patents and they had gone in and deleted the circuitry where our patents were.”</div><br /><br />Quoted from Bagnall's <em>On the Edge</em> book.

Can't think of anything else.<br /><br />Since I learned assembly with the 2A03, I don't really miss the decimal mode. In games you might need an occasional BIN to DEC conversion, or addition and subtraction of decimal numbers, but those are things you can code routines for just once (or even use someone else's routines) and never think about this again.

It still takes a lot of effort to get done, especially with the complexity of current chips.

ARMv4 (e.g. ARM7TDMI) doesn't have decimal mode or hardware divide. Someone on the gbadev board used to complain that the sprintf() call to convert binary numbers to decimal to draw the status bar every frame ate up a substantial portion of the available CPU time. And if you're storing both the binary version for calculation and the decimal version for display, why not just operate on the decimal version? That's what a lot of Atari 2600 game programmers tended to do, I'm told.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I imagine the most effective use case for this is an accounting program where you are keeping track of a lot of numbers onscreen, and you want to keep the UI responsive.<br /><br />Of course, there's the additional overhead when multiplying BCD, which might throw a wrench into that goal...<br /><br /><br />Anyhow, it's convenient to have. It's better than having to write extra software routines to do the same thing, but as has been pointed out, those aren't that hard to drop into your program anyway, so the benefit is pretty minimal. If the NES had it, it would have been used.
