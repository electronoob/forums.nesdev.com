		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I saw in <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=10585" class="postlink">this other thread</a> the GBA to SNES adapter. I'm intrigued as it seems to be basically a small SNES program that takes SNES controller data and spits out control to the GBA clone on there. It looks like it outputs NTSC video and is other than power and controls independent from the SFC/SNES. <br /><br />Does anyone have one? I'm interested if there is a way of giving it button input without the SFC side but instead giving it actual buttons / some simple logic. As powering it will be easy (of course) I am interested in using the GBA to SNES adapter as a much cheaper way of making a decent GBA-on-TV solution.

As an arbitrary guess, it's probably the two 74'595s over in the corner of the board.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I tried powering the adapter by feeding only regulated 5v and ground to it, nothing happens but a slight sound in the audio. So my guess is it needs the SNES to do something else for it to work.<br /><br />HOWEVER<br />You guys might be interested to know that at this point I pretty much fixed every single sound issues on the adapter. <br /><br />-Stereo sound now works. <br />-Volume and bass issues are fixed.<br />-And my favourite: The horrible audio buzz that plagued it is no more.  Its silent as a lamb. <br /><br />At this point, with the mods and fix ive done,  I must say this adapter Is the best solution to play GBA on the TV. It even beats the Official Gamecube adapter in most regards.

It scales the GBA in full screen glory with minimal minor blur. It looks sharper in composite than a Game cube player looks in component, even with the (sharp filter) <br /><br />R2: I am not sure but it looks like progressive. The image is very stable and Im getting pretty scanlines. <br /><br />R3: I have found some weirdness while probing the board with the scope.  Maybe it is hiding some better signal possibility but I will tell you quite franckly, it already looks better in composite than the Game cube adapter does in S-video or Component<br /><br />RSound Fixes: I explained what I fixed above. I am still fine tuning the fixes, when I am done I will publish pictures and explanations of all I have done.  I will also make comparison recording with real GBA and Gamecube player.<br /><br />Seriously this adapter is really neat. <br />Cheers!

Tomorrow Im out of town for the day. <br /><br />Also, at this point I can confirm that the output of the adapter is Progressive, its definitely not Interlaced.

The AD adapter blows it out of the water. <br />I do not know how the AD adapter achieves such a beautiful full screen scaling, almost seems like magic. I will try to take some screenshots.<br />There is some filtering obviously but its less heavy than on the Gamecube adapter. <br /><br />Another potentially cool thing about this adapter is that It feels like Zero input lag, compared to the Gamecube adapter where I feel there is a small delay.
