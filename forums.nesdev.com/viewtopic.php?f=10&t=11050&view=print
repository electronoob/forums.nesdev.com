		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />hey guys, i have been researching the &quot;nintoaster&quot; i am going to be starting a project like that soon. Im gather my parts as we speak. But i was thinking, wouldn't it be cool if u could play all the rom games on the my old NES?! and have a save state. thats when i did a quick google search and found this site!<br /><br />i have only been on here for a day and doing some exciting quick searches so i figured i'd introduce myself and maybe someone could help me and point me in the right direction?<br /><br />i was curious how the powerpak works? will i need to cut pin4 on the lock out chip to use the powerpak? does the powerpak come with all the roms on it or do i have to download them and transfer them onto the card, and then put the card into the powerpak?<br /><br />i read the instructions on the powerpak, but still alittle fuzzy, how exactly does the save state work? i know on my pc i have a few save state slots and those slots dont interfere with other games? is there multiple save state slots on the powerpak?<br /><br />like say im playing ducktales and save state, later on in the day i play megaman and save state, does duck tales get erased on the powerpak?<br /><br />has anyone else tackled custom NES cases? where modifications to the motherboard has to be made? I have watched this video <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDGR2MiCyYs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDGR2MiCyYs</a><!-- m --> acouple times now, i feel pretty confident EXCEPT for the &quot;Video Amplifier Circuit&quot; I dont actually know how to read that schematic. does anyone make their own V.A.C. in a kit form? or is there any detailed step by step walk threws on how to make a V.A.C.? <br /><br />thanks for your time guys, i have allot more reading to do!!<br /><br />danny

The PowerPak does not come with any commercial game ROMs. That would be blatantly illegal. You put the ROMs you want to use on a CF card which you put in your PowerPak.<br /><br />3. The PowerPak will copy your save RAM to a file on the CF card when you reset. A menu will come up giving you the option which file to use, and by default it will select the file with the same name as the NES ROM. Each game can has its own save file, or multiple save files. Note that this is different from &quot;save states&quot;, this is only for games that had battery backed save RAM, like Zelda or Final Fantasy, for example.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the Everdrive has overtaken the Powerpak on most things. It seems to have a bit better compatibility (according to this anyway <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://krikzz.com/forum/index.php?topic=340.0">http://krikzz.com/forum/index.php?topic=340.0</a><!-- m -->) and it's still supported by the creator and still receives updates unlike the Powerpak. It's also much cheaper and if you don't live in America the shipping fee of the Powerpak will be huge. The Powerpak uses compact flash cards instead of SD and has a slower menu interface than the Everdrive have or so I heard.<br />Finally the Everdrive comes in both 60 and 72 pin versions with cases while the Powerpak is NES only.<br /><br />This is just what I heard, I don't have a Powerpak myself. The Powerpak has an NSF player which the Everdrive doesn't, but that's like the only thing it does better AFAIK.

Anyway, I don't think Krikzz is the exception, because my Harmony cart also arrived directly to my apartment without problems. I'm thankful for that, because I couldn't possibly own all the Flash carts I do if all of them cost me twice what the stores ask for them.

Shipping from US is almost always very expensive nowdays.<br /><br />I bought the Everdrive from Ukraine as well, the shipping was cheap to Sweden and I got it within 4 days (maybe less)!
