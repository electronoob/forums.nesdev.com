		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The ONLY step by step resource of making a very simple program for nes that I can find with crazily extensive searching is from a link in a zip folder on nes dev which is to make a ball sprite move on screen.
<br />file:///C:/Users/computer/AppData/Local/Temp/jZip/jZip2E5/jZip356F/nesdev_tutorial.html
<br />However...The finished .nes file that is included doesn't even work, so the credibility that would make me want to continue spending long nights puzzling over it is kind of lost. There exists a step by step to make a background appear on the nintendo age forums...Other than that, good luck.
<br />
<br />I scoured the lists for any personally designed mods that happened to have a lingering asm file for my text editor to hungrily view, and I cross reference them with everything I've got trying to deduce what does what....
<br />
<br />I have read so much about 6502 and nes architecture that it hurts but yet when it is applied there are still no simple examples to build upon, and most of it seems lost.
<br />
<br />Nothing would compare to just any other resource in the universe that walks through a simple program and compiling it into a rom. 
<br />
<br />Someone tell me, does it exist? 
<br />Sorry for the blab, but I'm proving that I'm not just noobing up the forums without trying myself (which happens a lot it seems)
<br />
<br />I'm currently working on getting my famitracker songs onto rom via 'no carrier's multi-nsf rom playback code called 'vegaplay'- as soon as I figure out more of this stuff out I'm going to make albums and teach other people on the famitracker forums how to do the same.
<br />
<br />In any case, keep rockin' the creative power. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />

<br />Week 7 (linked in the link above) has exactly what you seem to be looking for if it's just a working source program you can look through with your documentation to see what does what. (pong1.zip) You'll need to throw nesasm3.exe in the same folder as the .bat file. It can be found here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nespowerpak.com/nesasm/NESASM3.zip">http://www.nespowerpak.com/nesasm/NESASM3.zip</a><!-- m --> And reading each week will probably help, as well as reading the discussions and questions posted there. You've said you've read a bunch of docs already, so I'm going to assume you're just having trouble pulling everything together, but here's a topic of suggested links for learning 6502 and NES specific things as well just in case: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=54530">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=54530</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />And of course, if you have a question about how to accomplish some specific task we'll be happy to answer it here, but I can't personally answer anything about music code.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The code I currently have is still just based off of <a href="http://nesdev.com/NES101.zip" class="postlink">NES101</a>.  Very heavily modified to the point where there is basically nothing left of the original, but it was my starting point.  It compiles fine and you can tweak variables to see how things change and build off of it.
<br />
<br />Loopy modified it for asm6 <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4699" class="postlink">here</a>, and asm6 is my favorite compiler since it's so easy to get running.
