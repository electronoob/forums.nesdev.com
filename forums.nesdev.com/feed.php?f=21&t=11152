You're right, many NES games had to be very carefully designed so that they looked good and avoided flicker as much as possible.  Ninja Gaiden uses reasonably sized sprites, but flicker isn't all to common.  This works due to clever game design.  On a similar note, while hated by many, Ninja Gaiden 3 can push an obscene number of objects onscreen (like that one stage when you're trying to go inside a plane, I think stage 5-1), AND has a pretty effective flickering algorithm.  Doesn't mean the scanline limit is ignored, but it can be prevented it seems.<br /><br />Thankfully RCR already has small graphics, and the cars aren't too bad.  I don't think there will ever be an instance where there will be more than three cars lined up horizontally, though the pedestrians and random objects (such as the parking meters, which appear to be sprites) might be a bigger issue.  And ideally, you might want to set drawing limits (Gradius does this to some extent) to further combat flicker.  For example, I think the largest vehicle in the game would be the Tank, so you could set a limit to show a maximum of two tanks as well as three police cars.  I'm certain you could outrun the Tanks (and by extension force them off-screen), but the cop cars will still be able to catch up to you.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6132">OneCrudeDude</a> — Tue Apr 08, 2014 12:40 am</p><hr />

If we could split up those groups further, into single 16 tile rows for different pedestrians, for example, that would be ideal.

I think RCR might be tricky to get accurate even on a per-color level.  It seems to use a true yellow, which wasn't possible on the NES, unless my eyes deceive me.<br /><br />Here is a map made by BriPro himself as part of a contest.  I think this map is quite big, possibly even too big to fit on the MMC5 without either compression techniques or a special submapper to allow greater storage.  BriPro also mentioned that the joke signs had to be cut out from the NES due to memory retraints.  Would it be possible to combine MMC5 with CHR-RAM, so that you can load up the billboards at a given interval and then swap it out as you see fit?<br /><br />Map:  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.retrocityrampage.com/map/city.png">http://www.retrocityrampage.com/map/city.png</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Contest (and other miscellaneous rooms):  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.retrocityrampage.com/worldmap.php">http://www.retrocityrampage.com/worldmap.php</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6132">OneCrudeDude</a> — Mon Apr 07, 2014 11:08 am</p><hr />

The two instances I mentioned being &quot;tricky&quot; are early in the game, you can see them within a few minutes of YouTube gameplay.  The Toasty looks like a larger sprite that's well above the 8 tile limit, unless you render it using a hybrid between background tiles and sprites for the edges.  The underwater level (which appears as a downsized homage to the TMNT water level) has most background objects &quot;warping&quot;, which can be done in software (like the &quot;wobbling screen&quot; from Casino Kid), but likely not to the same extent.<br /><br />As for the graphics, I think it's creative use of the NES' rather poor palette and a good selection of &quot;universal&quot; palettes.  Not saying it's the best, but I think it looks good.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6132">OneCrudeDude</a> — Sun Apr 06, 2014 10:53 pm</p><hr />

I know for example you can't have hundreds of objects moving around, as the NES is limited in display, and the NES doesn't do 16:9 video.  I also know that some things might be tricky (like that &quot;Toasty&quot; guy that shows up when some mook dies in an explosive car crash or that underwater level with the warping background), and the scanline limit would put a dent in the presentation, or at least in certain situations.  It's a shame since I really like the art direction and color use, a shame that very few commercial NES games looked that nice despite the console being well equipped for that.<br /><br />Oh, if I had the patience and will power.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6132">OneCrudeDude</a> — Sun Apr 06, 2014 9:38 pm</p><hr />

The good news is that since palettes can be applied to 8x8 pixel areas now, the built-in PPU ability to mask off the leftmost 8 pixels of the screen provides you with an area where horizontal scrolling updates can be hidden, just like in the SEGA Master System. There are also ways to mask off a bit of the top and the bottom of the screen so you can hide vertical scrolling glitches, specially if you have scanline IRQs at your disposal. With a little effort, you can have perfectly clean 8-way scrolling in MMC5's extended attribute mode.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Apr 06, 2014 9:14 pm</p><hr />
