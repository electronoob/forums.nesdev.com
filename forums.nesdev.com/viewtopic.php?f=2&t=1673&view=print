<br />One way is by drawing an opaque tile at the bottom left corner of the playfield.

It copies the original tile graphics to a specific tile number, changes the tile number for the lower-left corner, and plots a single PIXEL in that special tile.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since you make sure you never have 8 consecutives BG color pixels in the playfield, it will cause no problems to have a sprite zero hit with some 8 pixel tolerance (anyway, the tolerance so that the hit check loop is larger then <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />.
<br />I think the best way is to make sure to never have 4 horizontal consecutive BG color in your whole tileset.

<br />
<br />I think you have to be really careful with that trick, because even if you make sure the sprite hit will happen, you must also be sure that game logic will never go beyond the place where the hit is to happen.
<br />
<br />I was planning on turning the screen off early for a project, by having a sprite 0 hit on the last scanline, but am afraid that the calculations during the frame may take too long.

<br />However, in your case, that would just wait until the hit in the next frame, causing a slowdown that would happen anyways.

<br />Worse than the slowdown is the fact that the bottom part, that should be hidden, will be displayed for a frame, causing flicker and possibly exposing undesired/incorrect tiles/attributes.

<br />If you aren't using DPCM sound, you could borrow its IRQ for timing the sprite 0 hit. Start a DPCM playback in the vblank NMI, with a length such that it finishes a few scanlines before sprite 0. Then wait for sprite 0 inside the IRQ handler and do the PPUSCROLL/PPUADDR magic. But then you have to use an emulator that supports the game <em>Fire Hawk</em> if you want any accuracy.

<br />Hey, this has gotten me an alternate idea. Before the screen loads, wait a given number of cylces and write the value #$80 to $4017 to enable IRQ and use 4-step sequcne.
<br />Then the interrupt will continue to reliably happen each frame when the game logic goes on. Unfrotuntaly, I think the frequencey is a very bit shorter than the 60Hz framerate, so something to compensate this is needed (re-write to $4017 after wait the difference of time between screen and APU).

<br />
<br />Yeah, I tried to work this approach out a while back but was foiled by the APU's frame rate being slightly lower than the PPU's. If it were the other way around, it'd work out since you could reschedule the interrupt for the next frame slightly before the current scanline, after you had found a sprite #0 hit at the exact moment. Oh well.
