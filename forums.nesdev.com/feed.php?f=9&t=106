From what I remember, all bus contention is low when there is a GND access on the line. I follow that high impedence=high unless GND is present on the trace. Remember that EEPROMs are "born" high, then are forced low with a burn-in voltage.<br /><br />I am not exactly sure how contention works if a positive voltage is shorted with GND,though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26">AWal</a> — Mon Jan 17, 2005 4:45 pm</p><hr />

Ahhh, of course. Thx, I hadn't realized that  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />  CPU A0-A2 is directly connected to PPU A0-A2 which is why that the ppu registers ($2000-$2007) are mirrored, while CPU A15-A13 = %001 (which leaves 13 bits left, which means the regs are mirrored all the way from $2000 to $3FFF). That means it's very possible, but just hasn't eever been done. You just need to force CPU A0-A1 high on the write cycles of $4014.<br /><br />Memblers you should try to do something like that with your mapper. It would make it much quicker to write to all the four screen RAM that you have unboard (since your mapper forces the game to have 4-screens) and/or update the CHR-RAM much quicker (does your mapper use CHR-RAM?).<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Mon Dec 20, 2004 8:19 pm</p><hr />

The lines that choose a PPU register are CPU A0 through A2; PPU A0 through A2 go to VROM and VRAM. Has anybody tried making a cart that can force CPU A2-A0 high during PPU access (CPU A15-A13 = 001)?<br /><br />I think updating OAM through 'sta $2004' is error prone because 1. there's not enough vblank time to update the whole page, and 2. OAM is dynamic RAM without an interleaved refresh and tends to lose its contents rapidly under some conditions. Besides, games usually want to update only a few tiles of the nametable at once.<br /><br />But anyway, I would guess it'd be more stable to put VRAM on the cart, written to by a circuit that catches writes to CPU $6000-$7FFF, puts them in a FIFO, and writes them to VRAM between PPU accesses. What kind of circuit would this need?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Dec 20, 2004 5:14 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, that's what I'm going for. If the PPU A0-A2 is the same lines that set the PPU address register that the CPU is accessing, then I would think it's possible to force a 1 onto PPU A0-A1 on the write cycle of $4014 so that it would write to PPU register 7 (AKA $2007) instead of PPU register 4 (AKA $2004). I don't get why they wouldn't have allowed the DMA to write to $2007, which would prolly have been more helpful then $2004 DMA transfer in most games (but I guess that has something to do with the $2003/4 sprite updating being error prone for some reason (you know why?)).<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Mon Dec 20, 2004 4:54 pm</p><hr />

Or is it 8-bits and you can use any page in the CPU space?<br /><br />And does this DMA transfer only work with sprites as in when you use register $4014, as in it reads the byte in CPU memory then changes CPU A0-A2 to %100 (as opposed to any other PPU register), which makes the PPU register your accessing $4 (the sprite access register AKA $2004), and then changes the R/W pin to write + activates /CS pin, and then puts the appropriate on D0-D7. And it can't use any other register besides PPU reg 4?<br /><br />And also on the cart edge pinout, PPU A0-A3 are there, is that the A0-A2 on the PPU that's connected to the CPU (that selects what PPU register the CPU is accessing), or the AD0-AD2 that's simply the PPUs data or address pins (according to ALE?).<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sun Dec 19, 2004 7:04 pm</p><hr />
