		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi all,
<br />
<br />According to the wiki, writting any MMC1 register with a value whose highest bit is set makes the control register to be ORed with 0x0C. As far as I understand it, this only affects CHR-ROM bank mode, as PRG-ROM bits are left untouched. The point here is that I don't see why the wiki states, literally, "..locking PRG ROM at $C000-$FFF to the last bank.". So, although the bank mode is not modified, the PRG banks are swapped while CHR banks are left intact.. Why is that?
<br />
<br />I know MMC1 reset state is not known at all but.. would it be accurate to apply a reset shift register as MMC1's initial state?
<br />
<br />On the other hand, I think there's a typo in "Variants" section. Shouldn't SXROM combination be "512KB of PRG ROM and 16KB of PRG RAM" instead of "512KB of PRG ROM and 32KB of PRG RAM" (as SOROM chooses between TWO 8KB banks)?
<br />
<br />One more thing. Which exact registers and bits are "upper CHR bank select line" and "second-highest CHRbank select line" referring to in "Variants" section?
<br />
<br />Thx.

<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Regs&#91; 0 &#93; = 0x0F;<br />Regs&#91; 1 &#93; = Regs&#91; 2 &#93; = Regs&#91; 3 &#93; = 0x1F;</div>
<br />By doing so, several games don't even start running, while using 0x00 for all of them seems to work fine.
<br />
<br />On the SRAM side, ogghh.. it is quite a pain to implement this mapper properly for programs defined by the iNES header, as every MMC1 revision interprets differently every bit of its registers. How do you guys work this problem out in your emus?

<br />NESMpr001 is derived from NESMapperMMC1 which handles basic MMC1 functionality (combining the 5 writes into 1 full write, setting internal registers, etc).  The SyncXXX functions are virtual and are called after every complete register write.  (This inheritance setup also makes mapper 105 much easier)
<br />
<br />The strings and junk in my "Load" function eventually fed to mapper config box which can be opened through the UI:

<br />
<br />I also plan on eventually setting which to use automatically via a CRC.

SRAM protection is purely hardware stuff, I don't think many game will turn this on, and write to SRAM while excepting writes to be ignored. I guess this can be pretty much ignored when it comes to emulation, but developpers should still know about that bit, so that they don't set it and exept the SRAM to work as usual on real hardware (this will most likely work in most emus, and proabely with MMC1 and MMC1A too).

<br />Perhaps.  I suppose it would work the same if you simply don't give the game SRAM at all.

<br />At any rate, if you emulate MMC3's WRAM disable, it doesn't matter if you give the game SRAM or not because Low G Man disables it.
