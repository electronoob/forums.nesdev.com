		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It is certainly an interesting thing as a DIY project, and would be especially cool as an open source HW/SW project, but I should note that these days there is a ton of cheap Chinese portable consoles (Dingoo, Gemei, Caanoo, Ritmix, and countless others) with emulators, some of them also has TV out. I also recall something similar that had no screen, just a small box with USB and TV out. So if someone just wants a ready-made product, there are existing devices already.

<br />You could, but others might not:
<br /><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>Not many people are aware that PCs can display on TVs. They aren't aware that DVI out connects to HDMI in, that a lot of North American HDTVs have a VGA input (which European TVs often give up for SCART), or that SewellDirect.com sells a $30 cable to turn a VGA signal into a PAL or NTSC composite signal for an SDTV. In the mind of the general public, TVs are for living rooms and PCs are for desks and never the twain shall meet. </li><li>There tends to be a lot more controller-to-video and controller-to-audio latency in PC-based emulation than there is on an NES. I once measured 100 ms for VisualBoyAdvance on Windows, which made rhythm games unplayable. A single-tasking embedded system could shave tens of milliseconds off this. </li></ol>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Honestly speaking, I see little use for emulators that trade accuracy for speed. Today we have very portable computers that can accurately emulate a NES at full speed, just hook those to a TV and NES controllers and you get a relatively faithful experience.
<br />
<br />Hardware clones are a different story, because those have the potential to be 100% accurate and still use original peripherals and carts, which I consider a big deal.

<br />The point was that I'm not interested in buying a SBC, I'm interested in having fun designing an embedded system.

<br />By "ARMduino" do you mean the <a href="http://www.itproportal.com/2011/09/19/arduino-goes-arm-due-board/" class="postlink">Due</a>? 50 KiB of SRAM, 256 KiB of flash, but I don't know what video output circuits are commonly used with Arduino projects.
