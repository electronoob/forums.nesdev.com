<br />If you're just interfacing the RAM adapter to the PC and don't plan to use it with the Disk Drive, you don't need a PCB at all. I would (and have) cut off the FDS connector and put on a DB25.

<br />If I'm not mistaken, this is just another NOAC (NES-on-a-chip), as all newer famiclones. And AFAIK, their performance is questionable.
<br />
<br />The best famiclones (IMO) are the older ones (such as the "Phantom System" or the "Turbo Game", both that used to be sold here in Brazil), that had all the individual chips, pretty similar to the real thing. I have a newer famiclone (brazillian Dynacom), a portable famiclone (Pokefami, manufactured by the same people that make the Neo Fami), an older famiclone (Turbo Game) and an actual NES.
<br />
<br />The one that behaves most like the NES surelly is the Turbo Game. The Pokefami behaves very strangely when using it's built-in screen, but more normally when connected to the TV. The Neo Fami probably works just like this one, so I'm guessing it's not very good. The Turbo Game produces video and audio that is very similar to what the NES outputs. I haven't had the chance to test all systems with the so called "complex games" (that are known for not working on cheap famiclones) though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The easiest way to make the FDS end of the cable (for reading disks and rewriting them, if your FDS is equipped to write), is to use a SNES audio/video cable.  Make sure it has all 12 pins, though!  I bought mine from Lik Sang.  If the tip has all 12 pins (as thier stock did 2 years ago), you should be good. The plug is almost identical to the FDS plug, except the FDS plug is rounded on 2 corners and has right angles on the other two corners. whereas the SNES plug is rounded on all 4 corners.  THe SNES plug also has a lttle strip of plastic you have to shave off.
<br />
<br />Of course, the other method is to sacrifice a RAM adapter's cable for this.
<br />
<br />Now, for the PC to  RAM adapter cable for loading games directly from the PC to the RAM adapter, I used the audio video port from a broken SNES.  Remember that since the RAM adapter's plug has those two sharp corners that you must carefully cut away two corners on the inside of this port to make the Ram Adapter's cable fit in.  You could shave a bit off the two corners of the RAM adapter itself, but it makes more sense to do it to the female sideso you don't go putting the cable in upside down, not that you couldn't label it or something.
<br />
<br />You can also sacrifice a FDS Drive's port for this, but it's kinda wasteful.  The good news is that you can always hardwire the sacrificed ram adapter and FDS together after you snag the necessary components, only you won't be able to use that sacrificed system with FDSLoadr, just the FC.

<br />You're right that the best test cases for undocumented $2004 and $4010 behavior are Codemasters' unlicensed titles, but <em>Battletoads</em> (NTSC U/C) is licensed, right? It's the poster boy for PPU cycle timing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, the Neo Fami arrived today, and it works fine, with one quirk: the quarter-phase pulse output, for some reason, gets output as a half-phase pulse wave. I've only tested it with Final Fantasy so far; my guess (I'm not sure about this) is that perhaps pulse setting 3 (three-quarters phase, which sounds the same as quarter-phase) was overlooked and treated as half-phase, but I've yet to confirm this. The Famicom Disk System adapter boots fine, but I've yet to build the cable for further tests.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I made my first attempt at hooking up the RAM cart to the paralell port today, but no luck. The program and cartridge seem to be communicating with each other (the "disk in" signal is accurate and the program recognizes read attempts,) but nothing will load; it always reports an error 22 on the first file. Is this 22 decimal or 22 hex? 22 hex seems to mean, from the FDS technical reference I have, that it's expecting a file type of 1. 22 decimal doesn't seem to be a valid error code. Does anyone have any idea what's going on here?

<br />
<br />Anyway, quadruple check your wiring, then do it again.  Also, make sure you are running in pure DOS...no Windows, and definitely not Win XP.  Having a machine loaded with Win 98 works for me (well, I do have to boot to pure DOS, but you know what I mean), but just a pure DOS box will do the trick too.
<br />
<br />Also, you may have to set your parallel port in your BIOS to EPP mode.  Also, it probably won't work on most laptops.  Even so, try it on several computers, if possible.  Some parallel port's controller chips are ghetto shit, but this is mostly a problem only on laptops, and possibly, though unconfirmed, some small form factor desktops.
<br />
<br />It sounds like a wiring problem, but try the above and let us know.

I checked the BIOS settings on the original computer and the parallel port was *not* set to EPP mode, so I'm going to give it a shot in the proper mode.
<br />
<br />At any rate, progress has been made. Thank you all very much for your advice.

<br />
<br />Some games don't run at all.  Some games run but with bugs.  Most games run, but with incorrect sound and colors.  Apparently the world map in The Legend of Zelda bugs out after playing for a bit.  In other words, its performance is worse than modern emulators.
<br />
<br />I'd recommend a real Famicom.  There are, what, hundreds of thousands floating around out there.  They can't be hard to find, and buying the real deal helps preserve the original as opposed to perpetuating fakes.
