I updated my programs both the avr and computer-side to detect the capacity of the flash chip based on the chip ID. Also I merged the reading capabilities to the writing program to read instead of write specify -d after the file name I have not tested it but it should work if not please tell me.

Am I even splitting the file correctly, so together i have a 256kb PRG and a 256kb CHR (2Mbits each)?

Also if the game took smaller flash just don't connect all address lines to the NES cart and you only have larger flash just don't connect some of the high address lines.

I havent wired the chips in yet but i dumped the bios chips and they are good!<br />I think it would be good to add an argument like -s or --size that a user could use with unknown chips to dump. The 29c020 is read the same as any other chip (even the sst39sf020) but written differently, and since the 29c020 is half the default size, I think a chip size argument would be nice. I just edited the source code to alter the default size, but there should be an easier way.<br />example:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">flash&nbsp; dumpedfile.bin -d -s 262144</div><br />another possible way:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">flash&nbsp; dumpedfile.bin -d -s 2Mbit</div><br />or:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">flash dumpedfile.bin -d -s 2M</div><br />Just an idea. I tried this with the code and while it is a bit overcomplex the way I handled it, it does work (at least, the first example does, because it uses the simplest format).<br /><br />ONE PROBLEM:<br />It encounters a segfault when attempting to WRITE a sst39sf020 (2mbit chip). The old version (which I backed up) still will write them fine. It just won't dump correctly <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />console output with the new version (i did check that what I did was not the cause; it was not. your version had the same problem):<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Waiting for RDY command<br />RDYReady recived<br />Waiting for RDY command<br />RDYReady recived<br />Manufacture ID: 0xBF<br />Detcted as: SST/microchip<br />Device ID: 0xB6<br />SST39SF020A<br /><br />Chip is erased<br /><br />Segmentation fault</div><br /><br />If you would like to test I have some extra sst39sf020 chips and could mail you one in a RohS compliant bag and holder. But they are cheap and I would prefer not to pay the price of the chip in postage (if you live in the United States/maybe Canada).<br /><br />The old one and new one will only dump the SST39SF020 up to 0x023FFF, though (in decimal, it reads up through the 147455th loop). it works perfectly for the 29C020.  Still, for all I know, the chip might not actually write properly either, since I can't dump the whole thing to check. Could I have the shift registers messed up? I don't think they are messed up.<br /><br />And I have noticed that the led (CE) line stays on when writing is done. Is that the problem?

Someone here<br /><a href="http://blog.tynemouthsoftware.co.uk/2013/02/commodore-vic20-repair.html" class="postlink">http://blog.tynemouthsoftware.co.uk/2013/02/commodore-vic20-repair.html</a><br />made a new kernal (sic) chip for his VIC-20, remapping pins with a 24 pin DIL header and a 28 pin socket. I don't have a DIL and am vehemently against ordering anything else at this point. Does anyone know if this can be done with two sockets, or if there's a way to make a socket's pins longer?<br /><br />And can I wire this to my board just like an EPROM described here? Last time I did I don't think it worked, but I could have done something else wrong.<br /><a href="http://nesdev.com/NES%20EPROM%20Conversions.txt" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/NES%20EPROM%20Conversions.txt</a><br />The board itself is not messed up, i inserted the original Mario 3 rom chips into the sockets and the game ran. 'Earth bound' (the game i hacked and am testing with) will not, and neither will the unhacked version of earth bound.

Also I do not need any flash chips the f040 is so similar to the f020. Edit I tested this and still get stuck while dumping I will try to fix it.

I would like to point out that I was able to fully dump 29c020 flash chips, just not SST39sf020 chips. Have you tested the chips you burned with a repro cartridge? do they work? If not it may be the same reason.
