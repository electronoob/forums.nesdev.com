It's supposed to demonstrate the use of two undocumented hardware registers, nicknamed PCM12 and PCM34, which I <a href="http://gbdev.gg8.se/wiki/articles/CGB_Registers#FF76_-_Undocumented_.2800h.29_-_.28Read_Only.29" class="postlink">previously mentioned in GBDev Wiki</a>.<br /><br />Basically, these two registers allow reading the current PCM samples of each of the 4 APU channels in real time. This allows me to display real time oscillator-like audio visualization while playing music.<br /><br />Some interesting notes:<br /><ul><li> Since it's not documented, and as far as I know, never used in any official game or demo, not a single released emulator supports these registers. (My yet-to-be-released emulator does support them)</li><li> Some emulators read these registers as constant zeros, which are the correct values when sound is not playing.</li><li> These registers allow an entire different class of test ROMs to be created, which will eventually allow sample-perfect nanosecond-accurate APU emulation.</li><li> Music for this demo is <a href="https://github.com/LIJI32/superbomberman/tree/master/dboot/songs" class="postlink">adapted</a> from another project of mine, a disassembly of <a href="https://github.com/LIJI32/superbomberman" class="postlink">Super Bomberman</a>.</li><li> I actually discovered these registers by coincidence.</li></ul><br />Feel free to fork this demo to add more kinds of visualizations (Winamp AVS anyone?), and suggest other uses for these registers. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><img src="https://github.com/LIJI32/GBVisualizer/raw/master/screenshot.png?raw=true" alt="Image" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&gt; Actually, implementing support for these registers, at least in my emulator, was quite trivial; but potential test ROMs using these registers are definitely going to be a nightmare.<br /><br />I wasn't exactly thinking about the difficulty of supporting them; a cycle-accurate emulator could just grab the sample from the APU whenever it's clocked and pass it to the MMU whenever the registers are read. Seems relatively straightforward. It's just that, if you're OCD, a perfectionist, or someone who just can't sleep at night until your project emulates every little obscure hardware behavior, this is *grumble, grumble* yet another thing you have to look into <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />My DMG/GBC cores were never designed to be accurate in any regards. I'd really have to make a new core, because I'd be grafting so much code trying to get two conflicting designs to work. One of these days though.<br /><br />&gt; And yeah, I'd love seeing more demos using these. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I've always wanted to make full-screen TV-static transitions (like changing a channel) to jump from one scene of a demo to the next. Polling Sound 4's nibble in PCM34 is a lot simpler than coding my own LSFR, and definitely much faster. Setup a couple of writes to Sound 4's registers, initialize it, then read PCM34.<br /><br />Also, just FYI, GBVisualizer works just fine on GBA units. So, even though this was undocumented and never used in commercial games (at least it's not supposed to be) they still kept it around (probably not worth removing from the GBA honestly).

Tested, and it works!<br /><br />This is a bit off topic, but I tried GBVideoPlayer too a couple of weeks ago, and on my hardware it stops working at around half way. Any ideas? It's probably an issue with the EMS 64Mb cartridge I use (e.g. some incorrect edge case in MBC5 emulation), but I'm wondering if there's something in the code that relies on specific CGB hardware revision or flash cartridge behaviour. Have you received any success or failure reports from other people running it on real hardware?

I've never used the paging feature myself but apparently the cart is indeed 2x32Mb and does not work properly with 64Mb ROMs.
