After 8 reads, any additional reads will return $1 by default with standard NES controllers.<br /><br />Nothing else to it, right?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm going off of memory guys, so correct me if I'm wrong please, but aren't both these games reliant upon open bus behaviour, i.e. the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">cmp/cpx/cpy</tt> (not sure which the games use, but probably <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">cmp</tt>) is against what might seem like a &quot;non-logical&quot; value?  I could be wrong in remembering which games require this (do we have a list on the Wiki?), but it affects several.  I also recall this being a struggle point with the very first NES emulators.  Wiki reference with quote: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Standard_controller#Output_.28.244016.2F.244017_read.29">https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Sta ... 17_read.29</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">In the NES and Famicom, the top three (or five) bits are not driven, and so retain the bits of the previous byte on the bus. Usually this is the most significant byte of the address of the controller portâ€”0x40. Certain games (such as Paperboy) rely on this behavior and require that reads from the controller ports return exactly $40 or $41 as appropriate.</div><br />I'm not saying this is the cause of problem -- it certainly could be one of many other things -- but it's something that has to be kept in mind.<br /><br />That said -- and I say this with total respect, no negativity: while asking for help, and providing references to code is helpful and always appreciated, the thing you have to remember is this: most people aren't going to go sift through your entire emulator's code base to understand it just to help you fix a problem.  Even linking to just some particular part of your code base (some function/line/file), while it makes sense to you, doesn't make sense to us without significant investment.  For example, AFAIK, not many people here are familiar with Javascript (and I imagine even less so with Vue.js) -- we're more familiar with slightly less abstracted languages like 6502 assembly, C, C++, Python, Perl, etc..  We can explain to you how the NES works, but we often can't (without investing all that time) tell you exactly what's wrong with your emulator's emulation.  <em>On occasion</em> someone will do something like post a screenshot of a problem they're having with, say, emulating the attribute table or PPU stuff, and provide a screenshot of results along with a core piece of code logic (in a PL we're familiar with), and someone will go &quot;that looks a lot like you might have X/Y/Z bits set wrong, or your calculation for X/Y/Z is wrong&quot;, and the author goes &quot;OMG you're right!  That fixed it!&quot; and the problem is solved.  <strong>But this is generally quite rare.</strong>  So please keep that in mind.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Use a debugger is all I can say. Simply by setting a breakpoint in get() (and maybe set()) you should be able to find out if the values propagate properly to the game code. If that doesn't solve the problem, then I'd start stepping through the 6502 emulation code (again, in a debugger) while looking at the disassembly of the Donkey Kong controller reading code. It's probably a loop gathering the 8 controller bits in the accumulator. You can fairly easily verify what value it ends up with.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />First off, thank you to everyone who responded.  I'm pretty new to the forums so I appreciate the patience if I ask something that was referenced somewhere else.  Yep, the emulator is in javascript, yep I'm insane for doing such a task.  That primary reason I wanted to do it was to utilize vue.js so I could build debugging tools quickly.  Came along pretty well and I'm glad to be at this point.<br /><br />@tepples: I don't return anything in bit 1 when reading.  I either return 0x01 (button pressed), or 0x00 (not pressed).  No support for additional controller types are made at this time.<br /><br />@koitsu: I don't handle open bus behavior at this time.  Looks like rainwarrior clarified and grabbed the input loop I was going to fetch out of the code and it looks like it's a clean grab with no evaluation of open bus data.<br /><br />@lidnariq: Yeah, I actually just read that this morning. My code doesn't do that necessarily (in that situation, it'd return 0x01). So I'll make sure that when strobe is set high, it just constantly returns the state of the A button.<br /><br />@thefox: Yep, I'll have to set a cpu breakpoint in the emu and run through each command. Thankfully, @rainwarrior shows the address where input loop starts.<br /><br />I'll post findings of the debugging log later today after work.<br /><br />Thanks again everyone!<br /><br />TD

Since most control pad read loops use absolute addressing, that's why the bits 7 - 4 will be set with 010, since it's the bits in the high byte of val 0x4016.  Correct?  The only way it'd be different is if it was addressed differently.<br /><br />TD
