Yes, that is what I'm talking about. I had the tile numbers arranged in RAM, and I had to put them into a 16 byte array, and put it in the pattern tables.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun May 07, 2006 5:01 pm</p><hr />

I coded a routine to convert a 256-byte array into 4 16-byte tiles and output them to the pattern tables. Are you talking about something like that?<br /><br />I needed this because my decompression routine did a 16x16-pixel square at a time using 8 bits per pixel, for easy indexing. When the square was ready, it had to be converted and exported as 4 individual tiles, with separated planes and all the shit a NES expects.<br /><br />Celius, I think your program is interesting. I'll leave some comments on it's thread.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun May 07, 2006 4:09 pm</p><hr />

Hmm, what do you think is the hardest routine to come up with? The hardest I've encountered is this one, definitely. Another one that took me a while, even though it's not hard at all compared to this, was a routine that would take a sequence of tiles and make it into a 16 byte array. It's on <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/the_bott/gedit.nes" class="postlink">this graphics editor</a> that I made. One routine takes the 16 byte array that makes the tile and turns it into a sequence of tiles. That wasn't as hard as taking the tiles, and turning them into a 16 byte array. Do you know what I'm saying? If not, use the graphics editor, and you'll get an idea of what I'm talking about.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun May 07, 2006 2:06 pm</p><hr />

I don't know, it'd probably be like 8/5ths faster than the original, because there are 5 digits in the original, and 8 in the 24 bit one. I'm just roughly estimating. It's around there, I bet. What do you think? I mean, let's just face the facts, there is really no lightning fast way to do this. There is much to be done to a binary number to make it output it's decimal equivelant, so I think it's all pretty fast for what it has to do. And for games like Final Fantasy, they wait more than a few frames to load their screens with numbers on them that have been converted from binary, and do you really notice the wait? This is pretty good speed, I think.<br /><br />EDIT: Sorry, I meant it takes 5/8ths as long as the original, not it's 5/8th's faster! Sorry!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat May 06, 2006 8:56 pm</p><hr />

You don't need to be an expert at all aspects of programming in order to write good programs, and programmers of all skill levels are going to have some areas they are very familiar with and other areas they are less experienced with.  I don't mean to discourage anyone, either--anyone with the determination to stick with it will be able to learn the necessary skills and be successful.  (What was that famous Thomas Edison quote?  Something about 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":grin:" title="Very Happy" />)<br /><br />Bregalad, I'm almost sure you know more about the specific workings of the NES than I do.  I'm trying to write code generators to generate simulation cores for the 6502 (and other processors) but I myself have never written assembly language programs for the 6502.  Which is a skill I would definitely have to develop if I wanted to write NES games rather than emulators.<br /><br />Everyone should dream big and chase their dream.  That way lies greatness.  At the same time, most skills worth learning take a lot of time to learn, and most things worth building take a lot of skill and experience to build.  But you've got to start somewhere.  Its good to start with things that are really interesting, so you will have the motivation to keep working on them.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=330">mozz</a> — Sat May 06, 2006 6:16 pm</p><hr />
