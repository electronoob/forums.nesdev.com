But it looked like the emulation window became the blue background color that my ROM uses, so I was a little puzzled why I didn't see any graphics (I'm assuming it did start, and loaded the palette?)<br /><br />Program is looking really great, though!  Definitely has came a long way from the early releases.  I'm pretty much certain I'm gonna start using this, next time I start (or maybe restart) a game project.  I've mostly been doing hardware stuff lately.</div>
<br />
<br />In the toolbar there's a green play-button icon over to the right, with icons that look like a pause icon and green "fast forward" icons with the words "CPU" and "PPU" underneath.  Those are the emulator controls.  I moved them there because I felt it matched the UI experience of other IDEs like Visual Studio where the "run" icon is in the taskbar.
<br />
<br />What ROM are you trying?  
<br />
<br />Thanks for the feedback!

<br />Nevermind about the ROM, it was something I coded years ago, I guess the latest build I made of it was bad for whatever reason, it just crashes.

<br />Interesting.  The missing toolbar icons are all .svg's. The ones that aren't missing are .png's.  I thought I had gotten past this by including QtSvg4.dll in the distribution.  Sure enough they work on my end...not sure why they don't work for you.  Do you have QtSvg4.dll in the installation folder?  I just tried renaming it to something else and the app starts up and looks exactly like that screenshot (the icons are missing).

<br />Sounds like the dependencies are in your system path or something, if you have Qt installed.  That would make it kind of hard to test the install without using another computer.  This must be what they call DLL hell, heheh.

<br />Yeah I'll look into converting them all to PNG which *doesn't* have this problem.

<br />Added Find-in-Files dockable window.  Search output goes to output dockable window and from there it can be clicked on to bring up the relevant file/line.  (Typical IDE find-in-files functionality.)
<br />
<br />Added current-file search widget to toolbar.  (Search-as-you-type, forward or backward, case sensitive or not, regular expression or plaintext.  Typical IDE search bar functionality.)
<br />
<br />Fixed SVG icon problems--moved to PNG.  (Thanks Memblers!)
<br />
<br />Project now accepts any file types and only passes .c or .s files to compiler.
<br />
<br />Clicking on marker start/end cells in the Execution Visualizer will show that location in the Assemby Inspector or in the Code Editor if the appropriate source file is open.

<br />Fixed source navigator toolbar widget so symbol selector works--opens file where symbol is found and goes to that line.
<br />
<br />Added Ctrl+F hotkey for search toolbar activation, and Ctrl+Shift+F hotkey for Find-in-Files dialog activation.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi,
<br />
<br />long time lurker here. Last weekend I finally decided to give NES development a try. Some first impressions:
<br />
<br />- You should display an error message at startup when the wrong CA65 version is detected.
<br />- Check for empty paths in the build process. It caused me quite some headache, since the object directory path was not set at startup, so both ca65 and la65 tried to create files like /main.o which silently failed. After that, the whole build process just failed without any specific error message.
<br />- Maybe add some search and replace function <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />- I believe I found a bug in binary file inclusion: I was baffled when I included the free-to-use tileset from the wiki and the second half was completely wrong! Turns out you open binary files in text mode, as in cbinaryfile.cpp, Line 89:
<br />
<br />I think
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">if &#40; fileIn.exists&#40;&#41; &amp;&amp; fileIn.open&#40;QIODevice::ReadOnly|QIODevice::Text&#41; &#41;</div><br />should be <br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">if &#40; fileIn.exists&#40;&#41; &amp;&amp; fileIn.open&#40;QIODevice::ReadOnly&#41; &#41;</div>
<br />
<br />Thanks for your nice program!
