		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey all, I'm writing a review of one of the Famicom's best shooters, Gradius 2 and would like to put in the details of how the game was achieved. I know the game uses mapper 25, the Konami VRC4 but I don't really know much about it except that like the MMC2 mapper 9 was used only for Punch-Out, VRC4 is exclusive to Gradius 2. 
<br />
<br />Can someone here explain to me what the chip allowed and why it was needed for Gradius II? I'm also interested to know if Gradius II could be ported to a more common mapper like Contra was for a possible NES reproduction. 
<br />
<br />Also, is the VRC4 related to the VRC6 in Akujamou Densetsu and VRC7 in Lagrange Point? If so, what game used VRC5 and what did that chip allow? 
<br />
<br />Thanks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Looking at the pinout, it doesn't have the extra sound, the game is 128K and 128K ROM's, so there's no reason it couldn't be done on MMC3 unless it does something fancy....which it does! Read below. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> 
<br />
<br />So it offers the advantage over the MMC3 for instance is having 8K banks with only one fixed instead of two fixed, allowing for three other banks to be used for other stuff as far as I can tell. And probably the reason they did the new bank was to make it worthwhile using the chip, and to save costs on the games by not buying Nintendo's MMC3, which was probably more expensive to buy then this chip was to make. With the advantage of making their own mapper and adding a little other feature to it with the PRG-ROM switching in three 8KB chunks, it probably actually cheapened the price of the game and added more capabilities to it that they probably used to expand the game.
<br />
<br />The advantages is has over MMC1 is having three pages of data versus two, too, and of course the scanline counter and 1KB CHR-ROM chunks compared to the MMC1's 4KB chunks. 
<br />
<br />And the VRC6 compared to the VRC4, the VRC6 is a bit different. From what I can tell on the pages on VRC6, bank $E000-$FFFF is fixed, Bank $8000-$BFFF is a 16KB bank, and bank $C000-$DFFF is a 8KB bank also switchable. It could be a disadvantage or advantage depending on how you use it, but IMO, It's an advantage. Although you won't have as many banks, The 16KB is big and could be used as the nametable read-off, the 8KB could be used for banking in game program subroutines, and the fixed bank would be the main game engine of course. Thats my opinion though. It depends on how the programmers take advantage of that difference weather it's good or bad, really. It maps the CHR-ROM into 1K banks just like the VRC4, so no advantages there. Also has a scanline counter, too, so same thing there. 
<br />
<br />Here's the NESDev wiki pages from what I just read and compared. Check for mistakes in my advantages and such....blah blah blah. Thats my though on it and what I got from the pages. Have fun.  I hope I've been helpful and didn't get anything wrong, I've never used these mappers, this is just the information I can tell from the NESDev wiki.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />thank you for the info, but I must confess that much of that is lost on me. my working knowledge of mappers is rather superficial - I know of them, but exact bank switching duties and such is confusing and I don't really understand much of it. Could you recommend a good source of info on the subject suitable for a beginner? 
<br />
<br />What I'm simply looking for here is a paragraph or so why Konami would have gone to the trouble to build a MMC specific to this one game. The game has digitized speech, but it also has very smooth animation unseen in just about any famicom shooter and large, complex bosses without flicker or slowdown. 
<br />
<br />To restate my question, which of any of these does the VRC4 mapper accomplish? I just can't help but shake the feeling that this mapper does something special like the MMC2 allows for those giant Punch-Out sprites. Or was it as you pointed out, simply a cost-cutting measure and the game very well could have been done on the much more common MMC3?

<br />
<br />
<br />The way they switch doesn't matter, it's just the fact that it does it and the game uses it to access more data in certain ways. and VRC6 and VRC4 use eight pages of graphics. MMC1 uses two, allowing for less graphics and animations from the MMC1. VRC4/6 use eight pages too, as you see from the Wiki page. VRC6 has two program banks, one big and one small and one fixed. Allowing for a decent amount of new data. VRC4 has three banks, allowing for the same amount of data as the VRC6, but smaller chunks. MMC3 has two small banks of 8KB PRG-ROM space to swap data in and out, but a decently big fixed bank of 16KB for the main game, which is also good, but can be achieved on those VRC mappers with an additional bank that can be changed, so it's an advantage that they probably used and wanted so they used their mapper instead. The digitized speech might even have used the extra 8KB register as a data pointer to the data for the voice, which is maybe another reason they wanted it, they probably used the other banks for game data and wanted the extra one to do that voice. Not saying that they designed it for that ONE voice, but they probably had something like that in mind. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />
<br />The VRC4 does everything the MMC3 does, just allows for 8KB more data to be switched into program space, thats the simple way to say what it does. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />
<br />Just because the MMC3 was more common doesn't mean it was cheaper. Nintendo charged for those mappers and thats probably a reason Konami made new ones, it was probably cheaper and they could do more if they wanted. When your buying in lots of 500,000 carts and stuff like that, it makes a difference and gets awful cheap to get your own chips made. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah.
<br />
<br />So a way to think of it might be that the VRC4 has three banks of storage wherein to store the game's many one-time only boss sprites, boss patterns, stage layouts, etc? Gradius II does seem to avoid reusing sprites as most other shooters on the NES do. 
<br />
<br />That mixed with the cheaper costs of Konami producing their own chip rather than buying Nintendo's is why the VRC4 exists eh?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sure. You can only see so much in the NES anyway, but the VRC4 in that game allows for it to be swapped out more...."customized" to what it needs to look at. The game probably use the two banks at once and is made to run off of 32K and use the extra 8K bank to switch in what it needs if it needs to be used like possibly the voice or more game data. That obviously is the reason, to get more data swapped in and out, but as for if it's for the voice, I'm not sure. It swaps the voice data in SOMETIME obviously, and of course it uses a bank to get there, but the extra 8KB bank might have made it easier to add.
<br />
<br />
<br />I'm only guessing that the other reason they used it is it is cheaper, but thats just a guess, not fact. But I'd say it's pretty safe it's why they did it. Acclaim even used their own boards and cart shells in some of their games, probably because it was cheaper. No reason to go through all the trouble if it actually cost more and hurt the profit, right? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You seem to be mistaken. VRC4 is related to VRC2, and also is used in many more games than Gradius II. Lookup Bootgod's database to see all the other games using this mapper. To name a couple, Kid Dracula and Crisis Force use the same mapper as Gradius II.
<br />
<br />Gradius II was attempted to be hacked to MMC3 in the past. From what I recall part of the problem why it would never work on MMC3 was sprite fetching from the opposite side of the pattern table breaking the MMC3 scanline counter. Now Konami could have got around this since they programmed it. I think the MMC3 limited CHR banking was able to be sorted out. So Konami could have probably brought the game to the US and Europe, as they did reprogram Parodius Da! to MMC3 for Europe which also used VRC4. 
<br />
<br />Really games don't "require" some mapper, but sometimes sacrifices have to be made when you can't do certain things.

They were one of the few developers in a position to do something about it, they made their own ICs for all kinds of stuff.  Lots of their arcade games had custom chips, some of them even run on a custom CPU.
<br />
<br />You can find a bootleg copy of probably any major MMC1/MMC3 game.  Konami stuff, not so much.  Bootleggers would have been all over their stuff.
<br />
<br />So it could cost more to make, but at the same time they could still make more money, because they knew they were that good. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

All games published by other companies (except unlicensed ones, obviously) needed to have Nintendo itself to manufacture the carts for them (or they must buy parts from Nintendo, something like that) and so they could only use whatever design (casing, mappers, etc.) Nintendo had to offer.
<br />
<br />Nintendo went even more strict on their policies when they released the NES overseas (obviously, as seen from censorship, total number of games one could publish in a year, addition of the CIC, etc.) and demanded <em>all</em> publishers to hand over the game pak production job to Nintendo themselves (or buy parts from them blah bla bla). That's why Konami (and Ultra Games) had to change their games to standard Nintendo mappers when they're published for the NES.
