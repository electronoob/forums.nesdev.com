		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It comes down to how they take their clocks and how they are marketed. <br /><br />So a 6502 takes a a 2 phase non-overlapping clock, this basically gives it a 2mhz clock from a 1Mhz clock. This means its clock drivers are more complicated. The Z80 for example takes a 4Mhz clock, single phase. The 6510 fixed the clock issue and generates the clock internally from a single input clock. So from the 1Mhz clock the 6502 gets 4 events, from the 4Mhz clock the Z80 gets 4 events. <br /><br />You can't just have something happen from nothing, you need an &quot;event&quot; to trigger it, and to gate the logic steps. <br />Say LDA #4<br />Phi2 Hi: You need put the PC on the address bus<br />Phi2 Lo: You need to read the data from the data bus<br />Phi1 Hi: decode the opcode<br />Phi1 Lo: increment the PC<br />Phi2 Hi: put the PC on the address bus<br />Phi2 Lo:read the data from the data bus<br />Phi1 Hi: set the A with the value<br />Phi1 Lo: increment the PC<br /><br />Waiting cycles is not for RAM, you can just slow down the clock speed if you want to use slower RAM.<br /><br />Take the Z80<br />Clock 0 : put PC on address bus<br />Clock 1 : increment PC<br />Clock 2 : read value from data bus<br />Clock 4 : Do Ram Refresh, decode Instruction<br />Clock 5 : put PC on address bus<br />Clock 6 : increment PC<br />Clock 7 : read value from data bus into A<br /><br />If you want to do more things at once, you need to have move adders and the like on the die. So if you do it step by step you can use the ALU to increment the PC, as well as do an ADD instruction. Each bit of parallelization requires more die, which drops the number of CPUs per wafer and more gates equals higher chance of a chip failing and hence yes working chips, so that pushes the price up more.<br />your max clock speed is determined by which step takes the longest amount of time to do. So you might break a step down into smaller steps which makes it take longer but it allows for a higher clock overall.

Weicker intended to be representative of system (integer) programming. The Dhrystone grew to become representative of general processor (CPU) performance. The name &quot;Dhrystone&quot; is a pun on a different benchmark algorithm called Whetstone.<br />[...]<br />The Dhrystone benchmark contains no floating point operations, thus the name is a pun on the then-popular Whetstone benchmark for floating point operations. The output from the benchmark is the number of Dhrystones per second (the number of iterations of the main code loop per second).<br />[...]<br />Dhrystone remains remarkably resilient as a simple benchmark, but its continuing value in establishing true performance is questionable. It is easy to use, well documented, fully self-contained, well understood, and can be made to work on almost any system. In particular, it has remained in broad use in the embedded computing world, though the recently developed EEMBC benchmark suite, HINT, Stream, and even Bytemark are widely quoted and used, as well as more specific benchmarks for the memory subsystem (Cachebench), TCP/IP (TTCP), and many others.<br />[...]<br /><strong>Dhrystone may represent a result more meaningfully than MIPS (million instructions per second) because instruction count comparisons between different instruction sets (e.g. RISC vs. CISC) can confound simple comparisons. For example, the same high-level task may require many more instructions on a RISC machine, but might execute faster than a single CISC instruction.</strong><br /></div>Dhrystones actually measure integer computational ability. MIPS don't.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That is simply not true. <br /><br />(edit) There are just too many variables for such a flat statement to possibly be true. 8-bit PIC is more-or-less RISC (albeit accumulator-based, so...) but it does a lot less per instruction than any real 32-bit ISA.<br /><br />VLIW, approximately the CISCiest of CISC things, does tremendously more per instruction during every instruction. By definition. Many modern ISAs include SIMD instructions, which are CISCy, and their corresponding truly-RISCy things are horrifically more verbose than natively supporting SIMD.
