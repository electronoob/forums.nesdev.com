<br />I only have the famicom so I cannot compare against a NTSC NES, but the game actually runs but clearly with visible glitches. I don't know how sprite reads affects the picture (haven't disassembled it) but I assume that is the source of the glitches. (I don't own the game so I'm running it on the powerpak but I don't think that's a problem since it only uses mapper 2.)
<br />
<br />Actually, I found that the FCE ultra emulator appears to emulate $2004 reads as open bus and behaves almost identical to the famicom (while every other emulator I tried instead returned OAM data), and the errors are very similar when running the game on that emulator. This would be  one way to detect famicom/NES, does anyone know if there are more differences?

<br />
<br />According to blargg's findings, it depends on the CPU&lt;-&gt;PPU clock alignment, which is random on an NES. In 3 out of 4 possible cases, the readback fails. One particular alignment however yields success. This case seems to never occur on the Famicom.
<br />
<br />The Famicom uses the same PPU as the NES. However, on the NES, the RESET line of the PPU is connected to the reset button/circuit, while on the Famicom, it is disabled. This could be the reason for the behaviour, as it seems to affect the initial state of the PPU on power-up.
<br />
<br /> If you push RESET on your Famicom, the picture remains stable and visible, while on the NES, the TV loses sync due to the PPU H and V counters being reset.

<br />Wow. That's enough proof right there that its reset line isn't connected. I had never realized there were so many small differences between the systems.
<br />
<br />I got fed up with OAM weirdness on my NES a few days ago. There's just too much obscure behavior when setting even $2003. As far as I'm concerned, the only things a game should do are write 0 to $2003 then write to $4014 to DMA sprites. Anything else is going to give you headaches and break your game for some systems/phases of the moon.

<br />
<br />So this means that any game that uses any raster screen effects will show a garbage screen while reset is held down on the Famicom?  Interesting.  Punch out would probably still show a stable picture.
<br />
<br />I guess Nintendo changed this so that the lockout chip would actually lock you out.

<br />I don't see how this would have anything to do with clock alignment. I guess your famicom has a earlier PPU revision, that's the only possible explanation. Then it opens up to the possibility that later FCs allow OAM reading, and that earlier NES don't. Some eariler Famicoms also lacks short-repeating noise I've heard. Does yours fall in that category ?

<br />
<br />I would be careful with terms like "only possible explanation", unless you have seen the PPU schematics. On blargg's NES, the clock alignment apparently DOES determine the read behaviour, which on the other hand is dependant on the power-up state. So on the Famicom, it may very well be related to the fact that the PPU is in a different power-up state than the NES. It may of course also be true that  this is because of a different PPU revision (though not being able to read something flaky sounds more like FIXING a glitch).
<br />
<br />One practical way to find out is to run the test on a NES where the /RES pin of the PPU is tied to VCC in a similar fashion as the Famicom.

<br />It affacts reads behavior, but it DOESNT affect the fact it read something. (as opposed to open bus).

<br />Sorry for digging up an old thread, but this topic came up again at IRC #nesdev so, just for fun, I took a look at what Micro Machines does. I know the principle of this is old info, just wanted to see how this specific game ticks.
<br />
<br />In the title screen it reads $2004 8 times on scanlines 16..23 around scanline clock ~310:
<br />
<br />FD6E     BIT $2004
<br />FD71     BMI $FD73
<br />FD73     ...
<br />
<br />So it adds an extra cycle whenever the value returned by $2004 has the top bit set. It's exploiting the fact that at certain times $2004 read always returns $FF and at certain times proper values from OAM, depending on which PPU cycle the read falls on. That way they get a more precise CPU-PPU sync.
<br />
<br />So yeah, no reason for this game to fail on Famicom.
<br />
<br />...
<br />
<br />On the same note, has anybody tested if the palette readback through $2007 works on Famicom?
