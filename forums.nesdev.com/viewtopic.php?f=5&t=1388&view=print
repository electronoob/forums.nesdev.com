		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Time for a pet peeve of mine. What significance does the word "real" have in the phrase "real NES"? I'll admit I've used the phrase a few times and perhaps this adds to my annoyance. Compare:
<br />
<br />"I just tried the game on my real NES and it does the same thing."
<br />
<br />"I just tried the game on my NES and it does the same thing."
<br />
<br />I know my peeve began before I even got into emulation, when I noticed the word being used a lot in conversation. Extensive use of it implies that one is usually not talking about the real thing, devaluing the words. Taken to an extreme, the word "real" has to be tacked to everything. "I just tried a real game on my real NES and it really shows a real glitch on my real TV seen through my real eyes."  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />For the constructive approach, I propose that plain "NES" refer to the Nintendo Entertainment System console, made my Nintendo. "NES architecture" refers to the architecture employed in the NES. "NES clone" refers to consoles made by other companies that roughly match the behavior of the NES. "NES emulator" refers to software implementations of the NES architecture that run on a PC or other platform. "Real NES" becomes redundant and unhelpful.
<br />
<br />About the only practical use of "real" is when a claimed behavior of the NES is wrong, and one wants to refer to the actual behavior as opposed to the claimed behavior. "Hmmm, that can't be because it breaks this. What's the real behavior in this case?" In other words, a false claim devalues the words, so one must add qualifications to patch up the broken words.
<br />
<br />(And yes, I think about linguistic issues like this a lot, because I think careful use of language can be of great value.)
<br />
<br /><strong>ADDITION</strong>: There's already <a href="http://fakenes.silohware.com/" class="postlink">FakeNES</a>; someone should make an emulator called RealNES to discourage people from saying "real NES". "Wait, you tried it on RealNES or a real NES?" haha. Oddly, I found two references to "RealNES" on the web, both apparently referring to a real NES, not an emulator.

<br />From the hey-i-think-i've-seen-that-before department: Visit <a href="http://pineight.com" class="postlink">tepples</a>' site and check out the link to a site that hosts software that removes cascading style sheet code from HTML, called DeCSS, the aim of which is to mask references to the <em>other</em> DeCSS. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />In other words-- sounds like a plan. I'm off to go play some real Ghosts N' Goblins.

The value of a common language is less verbosity and more clarity. For example, if we made more use of the terms "logical address" and "physical address", discussions of mirroring would be simpler. Without precise terms, you'll see people having to resort to phrases each time they refer to something, resulting in less clarity on the reader's part. If you want to see where this actually hurts things, look at people having trouble understanding descriptions of NES operation, where stating something once isn't enough because the words have lost their precise meaning.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">baisoku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'm off to go play some real Ghosts N' Goblins.</div>

<br />I'd extend "famiclone" to cover 72-pin clones as well. But as far as I know, there are vastly more 60-pin famiclones than 72-pin famiclones.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Often, if you ask someone if he played/have some rare game, he'll say it have it even if he technically only have an emulated image of the game that he played under an console emulator.
<br />Typically :
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">- Hey do you have Tales of Phantasia ?<br />- Yes, I have it, and I finished it.</div><br />(I took Tales of Phantasia as a random good example of a rare game running on a Nintendo console).<br />The man saying the answer could very well mean : "No, I don't have the <em>real</em> game, but I played it under an emulator and I finished it under emuloation", since the game is rare that will be normal to say you have it without actually having it.<br />On the other side, if you ask :<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">- Hey, do you have the 'real' Tales of Phantasia</div>
<br />The question doesn't really ask about if your friend played the game or not, but rather if he has the rare cartridge or not, where the world 'real' takes all it's importance. Your friend is supposed to answer "Yes, I have it" or "No, I have only the GBA remake / I have only it emulated". He wouldn't be supposed to answer "Huh ? What's is Tales of Phantasia", as he would in the first question.
<br />
<br />So, the same apply on test purposes for developpers.

<br />"Yeah, I have a NES"

<br />So, saying "real NES" definitly is dull, because just "NES" is enough to say it is real, since nobody will claim his emulators to be a NES. Famiclones, etc... are definitely not NES also, so you're right.
<br />However, this applies to the console, but not to games. Playing a real cart can be opposed as playing on a homemade card or playing under emulation, so here the word 'real' can be meaningfull. For example, I can play a false FF2 card on my real NES.

<br />I agree mostly with this. The context will usually make it clear.
<br />
<br />"I played TOP on an emulator"
<br />"I played TOP on my SNES"
<br />"I played TOP on my SNES using a flashcart"
<br />
<br />If you're playing on hardware, unless your flash/eprom cartridge doesn't work right, there's no difference between that and the official cartridge.

<br />It could also differ it you use a bad translation patch that works under emulation, but not on the hadware (notice the avoiding of the word "real", we should all start to take that habbit, right ?). I also had to hack FF2 to work under the hardware, because the intro screen of the translation was designed for Nesticle...
