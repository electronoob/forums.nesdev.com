		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A while ago, kyuusaku brought up the idea of a file format for dumping NES carts into, which was based on a hardware description language (HDL).  Since so much effort is currently being put into creating hardware descriptions of mappers, for use with the PowerPak, I thought that I would bring up the topic again.  The idea is something like the following...
<br />
<br />The new format would consist of a single ASCII text file for each cart.  Such a file would contain a specification written in a HDL that was just powerful enough to be used as a cart description language, yet simple enough to be emulated in real-time on a modern PC.  A specification would describe a cart's mapper as well as describing the format of each ROM chip in the form of a hex string.
<br />
<br />The benefit is that emulator authors would never have to worry again about adding support for additional mappers.  They would only have to support emulation of the core NES system, in addition to emulation of the cart description language.
<br />
<br />Since I don't have an encyclopedic knowledge of hardware description languages or NES carts, I have no idea if it is possible to make an easily emulated "cart description language" capable of describing any reasonable NES cart.  So I thought that I would pose the idea in order for a more knowledgeable person to comment on the feasibility.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I honestly don't know if that would be feasible or not. A similar idea is to still have the emulator take care of emulating the extra chips, but have the file describe the wiring details. That would greatly simplify the emulator and make adding new mappers easy enough, so long as it uses an already emulated chip. The XML format that Marty of Nestopia is working on may incorporate something like this to some extent.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think it could be pretty straight forward if the logic was evaluated through a linked list. The emulator would need provisions for boolean gates, mux, flip flop and decoders (the rest could be described in the mapper), but it could dynamically allocate the required parts and use pointers for wiring. I think it'd be nice to have the description in a plain text file, I know nothing about XML.
<br />
<br />For this to happen though emulators would need to bring their mapper handlers to a much lower level. My emulator is pretty low level but it's also really crappy and can't run any games. Maybe someone could modify a better and more popular emulator like FCEU for a conceptual test.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This sounds like a good idea, trading a little bit of speed for consistency across emulators and accuracy.  If you think about it the HDL (Verilog or VHDL) for a mapper is a complete description of the mappers functionality.  Seems like a CDL should be able to be "compiled" either into a HDL description of the mapper, or into C/C++ source to be used in emulators.

<br />
<br />* New cart with new FM sound chip found on it.
<br />* Homebrew card with extra processor (Squeedo, etc.)
<br />* Updates to knowledge about behavior of a common mapper (do you have to update every cartridge file?!?)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't see how translating "CDL" to an actual HDL (other than CUPL or something) could be pleasant. It wouldn't be hard to manually place and route schematic symbols according the description though.
<br />
<br />I really like simple HDLs which use very little abstraction, just bits, vectors, operators and wires like AHDL. This would be an ideal way to represent mappers since the language is more like functional documentation than code.
