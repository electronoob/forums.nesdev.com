<br />
<br />A couple of amendments I wish to make to the instructions on the site:
<br />1. It is safest for emulation users (that includes pretty much everyone here) to go straight for the no-lag version of the client.
<br />2. Although letting more than one person use your computer under one WhatPulse account is an ethical violation, using video-game emulators to obtain keystrokes isn't (yet).
<br />
<br />Oh BTW, if you have any desire at all to support Firefox, please join the <a href="http://mozilla.wikia.com/wiki/SFX_Teams:WhatPulse" class="postlink">SpreadFirefox team</a>.
<br />
<br /><em>Disclaimer: "Distributed non-computing" is not an officially accepted term to describe what WhatPulse does. I made that up myself.</em>

<br />It counts the number of keys you press. The site says it has no intention of ever recording what's actually typed. A standard Network/Internet Packet monitor would allow you to verify this. The method I recall off the top of my head is to route the internet communication through Proxomitron, and enable posted data viewing in the logger. There's a freeware packet monitoring program out there(which takes longer to setup), but I can't remember the name right now.

<br />
<br />Where the hell does the Internet come into the picture? I can understand a program that counts how many times you press each key (heck, I even wrote one a few years ago), but the use of the Internet baffles me. Your description reads just like the website, where some missing link is silently skipped over as if the reader already understands what the program does. Here's what I've got so far:
<br />
<br />1) WhatPulse is a program to run on your PC that keeps totals for the number of presses of each key on the keyboard.
<br />2) ???
<br />3) Data the program sends over the Internet does not include what you typed (the order of key presses)
<br />4) Profit!!!

It simply automates the internet communication, and would allow you to look at the statistics from any internet-connected computer. A standard internet capacity.

I'd never time myself on a project without good reason, but if someone else wanted to, that would be a decent place to investigate...and as for the insane key rates, it could either be someone fiddling with their stats when they get submitted for bragging rights, or they could be artificially increasing the count to get their user pages advertized.
<br />
<br />User pages that look like this were probably the original intention:

<br />
<br />I was really thinking more about the "Spread Firefox" aspect (specifically <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/node/23996" class="postlink">this</a>) than I was about rationally explaining the situation with WhatPulse itself. I was trying too hard to kill two birds with one stone (making a dent in the unpopularity of WhatPulse and trying to show some support for Firefox).
<br />
<br />@Memblers: I think that one user is allowed to use one WhatPulse account across multiple computers (as is allowed with real distributed-computing programs), subject to the restriction that only one person is allowed to use those computers while that particular WhatPulse account is logged in.
<br />@ugetab: I know this won't halt the Thread Necrosis System, but let me say that even though <em>some</em> users get really crazy about their WhatPulse performance (as happens with real distributed-computing programs), most users don't.
<br />
<br />We may as well shift the focus of this thread (point #2 below should really be a split):
<br />1. Can anyone suggest some other message board where the users might be more amenable to an ideal like WhatPulse?
<br />2. Is anyone here using any real distributed-computing software? (<a href="http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/" class="postlink">Example</a>)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry about my annoyance earlier in this thread. It was clear that at least the privacy issues were one thing overriding the attempts to describe the program. For some reason I get annoyed by cryptic descriptions of things, be it for a product or while reading a technical book.
<br />
<br />On the topic of WhatPulse and attempting to be the one who uses the most keystrokes, what about being the most efficient user of keystrokes on a computer? Being able to waste keystrokes isn't a big accomplishment. Reminds me of an old NES controller that took batteries and had an LCD (Mega?) with a game to press the buttons the fastest. I made a little LEGO device with a motor that quickly pressed the buttons and got the top score easily.
