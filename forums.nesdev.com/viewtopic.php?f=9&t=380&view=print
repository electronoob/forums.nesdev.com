<br />
<br />Buy a can of QD Electrical Cleaner from the hardware store. Spray the edge connectors of the games, and quickly wipe with a cotton rag. Then spray the inside of the NES (connector), and put a game in there and move it around as best you can.
<br />
<br />This stuff is non-conductive, so you can still turn it on while its wet.
<br />
<br />My friends all freak out when I do this to their systems, but they work flawlessly after that.
<br />
<br />BTW, if the games/ or system got wet, it might need to be DE-OXed, which you can buy from Radio Shack.
<br />
<br />I think we should make a sticky for cleaning dirty NES systems.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the help to the both of you. I took apart my nes and really did a deep cleaning inside of the unit. Man, was it ever filthy in there. I must have went through 20 cue tips just to get the pin connecter clean. I fired it up and it works great. Again, thanks alot.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually, dirt usually isn't the cause of this (though I suppose it was this time). It's the pins getting bent back. If cleaning doesn't work you need to pull off the cart connecter and pry up all the pins a little with a screwdriver, so they make better contact. Just don't let them touch eachother.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I know this topic's like 60 years old, but oh well, I'm posting here. Whenever I take apart a NES, When I put it back together, that stupid plastic stick that goes through the hole when you press the cart down, it gets stuck. This happens with both of my NESs. Why? Does anyone else have this problem? I have to always adjust it so it's not to tight, and I have to frickin' leave out the screw below the cart insert thing that screws in the main NES cover, because with that on, it snags on it again. WHY? I'm sure this isn't a good idea to have this senario, but it's the only one that works somewhat for now.

I had to have some screws not too tight, and some tight, and it was really dumb, and annoying, because it was like 3 in the morning, and I was so tired of screwing things in, I was about to throw that thing out the window. Okay, No I wasn't, but I was tired of screwing things in.
