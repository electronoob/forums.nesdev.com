Let me try to explain it. The 6502 can only see 64KB of memory, because it only has 16 address lines (2^16 = 65536). Only half of that is used to access the ROM, because the other half is used to access RAM and internal registers. 32KB of ROM is not much, and as games became more complex they needed more space.<br /><br />You can't make the NES see more memory than the 6502 allows, but you can mix and match smaller banks of ROM and make them visible in the available memory range. You'll still see only 32KB at any given time, but you can map different parts of a bigger ROM into those 32KB. Each mapper has different bank sizes and different rules, but one thing that doesn't change is that you need to tell the mappers which banks to put where, and you do that by writing to their registers.<br /><br />When you try to write to PRG-ROM ($8000-$FFFF) the mapper intercepts the writes and redirects them to one of its registers, depending on which address was used for the write. Simple mappers (CNROM, UxROM, AxROM, BxROM, etc.) only have one register, so you can access it by writing to any address between $8000-$FFFF. Mappers with more registers break up that space into multiple ranges where the different registers can be accessed.

It wouldn't want to switch between the sprite and the background file when one of the tiles from rows e and d are used, would it?  Does 0fd0 - 0fdf refer to row d of the 4k chr file?  If we want to use the same chr file in  register 1 and tile d1 is read, does it create a problem with latch 0... or does it stay with the same chr file?

Basically what you do is do a sprite 0 hit or NMI, then switch the graphics to the appropriate bank for the next scanline to use in the status bar or something.

Do I need to write code like this<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.org $8000 ;empty switchable PRG bank<br /><br />.include &quot;mmc1_bank0.asm&quot; if switchable bank = 0<br />.include &quot;mmc1_bank1.asm&quot; if switchable bank = 1<br />...etc<br />.include &quot;mmc1_bank15.asm&quot; if switchable bank = 15</div>  How could that be done? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></span>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You don't have to write various reset stubs with repeated code. That's redundant and prone to errors. You can make an include file with the stub, and call the label <strong>-reset_stub</strong>, so that the assembler doesn't complain about repeated labels, and then for the vectors you can just use <strong>.word vblank, -reset_stub, irq</strong>, still inside the include file, to completely get rid of redundancy. Just include that file at the end of every bank.
