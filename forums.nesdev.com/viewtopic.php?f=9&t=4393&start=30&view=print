I already wrote the networking code from another (tcpip based) project, and I wanted to see if I could make it work with the serial port..  you can kinda tell by the "fake synchronize" code that it doesn't exactly *need* asynchronous code.  It got a bit outa hand.
<br />
<br />It would definately be better to keep it simple asuming were trying to make a *useful* project, but since I found myself pasting you code from there more than once I thought it would help if you just had the whole thing <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />This doesn't mean what you've written is useless.  I'm thinking that a simple libCopyNES would sit underneath all of your other stuff that is in that library.  That way it would still be useful to you.

<br />Agreed.  I think everything useful (to copynes) out of that package is already in your file.
<br />
<br />There is a ton of code there, but most of it is recycled.

<br />I'll be adding features to this library as time permits.  It currently supports getting the version string and playing the cart in the NES.  The next feature I'm going to implement is dump cart.

<br />
<br />I added support for loading and running plugins on the CopyNES and reading the mirroring byte and the return packets.  I have updated the bcn command line tool to use the new features in libcopynes.  It now has a "dump" function that takes the name of the plugin rom as a parameter:
<br />
<br />./bcn dump nrom.bin
<br />
<br />I was able to successfully dump Super Mario Brothers using the nrom.bin plugin.  I received the mirroring byte (horizontal mirroring), the 32K PRG packet and the 8K CHR packet.  The bcn app isn't able to write out .unf or .nes files yet but I leave that as an exercise for the reader <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />The next feature I am going to add is support for the various RAM carts, starting with the PowerPak Lite since that's the one I own.

<br />
<br />It'd be cool if you could make your code for creating .nes and .unf files a library too.  That way we're building up a set of libraries for all of these common functions.
<br />
<br />As I move forward with libcopynes, I'm realizing that most functionality is actually in the client applications.  libcopynes is pretty much done at this point, so I'll probably set up a proper project for a fully fleshed out client app that uses a GUI toolkit.  I'm thinking wxWidgets or gtk# if I can figure out how to do C# to C interop.
<br />
<br />I have to confess that I just set up a windows box with visual studio on it so that I can step through the CopyNES app code.  It is a little hard to follow in my head.  Once I get a good couple of hours to dissect it, I'll be ready to bang out a fully featured, cross-platform client app for libcopynes.
<br />
<br />(This was all much easier than I thought it would be).

<br />On my system I have to run the following commands to compile bcn:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">$ gcc -c bcn.c<br />$ gcc -o bcn bcn.o -lcopynes -L/usr/local/include/copynes<br /></div><br /><br />This assumes that when you installed libcopynes you did the following:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local<br />$ make<br />$ sudo make install<br /></div>
<br />
<br />There are functions in the CopyNES source zip file from retrousb.com that write out .nes and .unf files.  I added a TODO comment in the bcn.c file on where to call the function that writes out the files.  
<br />
<br />Good luck and send me patches for any changes you make.  I'll make bcn into a proper open source package soon.

I switched the library over to using all async I/O on the serial port plus I finally figured out how to properly configure the serial port so that I get the raw, 8-bit data being dumped over the wire by the CopyNES.
<br />
<br />I just ran a few tests where I was able to dump a very popular NROM cart into .chr and .prg files using the latest version of <a href="http://www.linuxprogrammer.org/bcn-0.3.tar.gz" class="postlink">bcn</a>.  I then ran those through crade's util for making .nes files from .prg and .chr.  I was then able to use the windows CopyNES app to put the .nes file onto my PowerPak Lite RAM car and play it.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I'm convinced that the data I'm getting from the CopyNES is now clean.  I'll now be able to move on to supporting more complicated CopyNES plugins.
