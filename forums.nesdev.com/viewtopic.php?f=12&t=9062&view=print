		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi there guys! You fellas seem like the knowledgeable sort to run this by, so here goes. For ages, I've wanted to own a number of Japan-only SNES games in English. Then I heard it's possible to take a SNES game and replace the original ROM with one of the many fan-translated versions available on the internet and play them on the original hardware! I've been reading up on how to make SNES reproductions and I think I understand how to make them now, but I thought I'd check with you guys first <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Donor Carts</span>
<br />As I understand it, you can make an English version of a Super Famicom game by using the original Super Famicom cart. This is appealing to me, as it greatly simplifies the process (no need to find which game is compatible) and I also get the original label and packaging as well <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> Is this correct?
<br />
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">The chips</span>
<br />One thing that bothered me with many reproductions I'd seen is the larger games needed multiple eproms soldered together. This really tweaked my sense of aesthetics. But now I see you can get TSOP adaptors that fit the spot that the original ROM was in, no need to solder together multiple eproms, no rats' nest of wires. Much better! Now, as I understand it, the parts required for this style of reproduction are:
<br />29F032
<br />DIP36-TSOP40 Adapter (III)
<br />
<br />I've been looking to get these parts from buyicnow.com, and I see they sell what <a href="http://www.buyicnow.com/vp.php?pd=2503" class="postlink">appears to me to be a 29F032 and a DIP36-TSOP40 Adapter (III) pre-assembled</a>. This appeals to me, because this would save some fiddly soldering, plus buyicnow.com also have a programming service, so I wouldn't need a programmer either! Also, is the brand of the 29F032 and it's speed important?
<br />
<br />Now, this would be for larger games, but it seems wasteful if the game I'm trying to make is less then 32 Megabit in size. So what are my options in this case? Keep in mind, I'm looking for something neat and tidy in appearance <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />So what do you guys think? Do I have all the facts right? Let me know!

<br />not a horrible price for it either.  If I didnt already have about 20 of those made up in my workshop, I would probably pick a few up.
<br />
<br />I would use a TSOP for any game over 16mbit up to 32mbit.  For 16mbit games, just use a 2 mask board.
<br />
<br />Speed of a 29F032 is not important, as every version of that particular chip is more than fast enough for the SNES.  That being said, I would not spend any extra money on a faster one, as it would just be wasted capability.

Depending on your region, you might need to swap out the CIC for one from your region though.  A lot of people here have very strong opinions on repros, especially if you're using a good game as a donor.  Personally, unless it's a special chip game, I would rather see you buy the Japanese game (you know, so you legitimately own the game), then buy a crappy sports game to use as your donor, then just swap the boards, so the original Japanese board stays intact, but that's just me I suppose.
<br />
<br />Brand doesn't matter as long as it is a *29F032 part number, speed doesn't matter as long as it is -120 or less.  More than -120 won't run FastROM games.  More than -200 won't work, period (although I've never seen a 29F032 that slow).
<br />
<br />I'm pretty sure the SKU that goes with that photo of a pre-assembled board is actually for ordering just the board.  The SKU listed as "on board" really makes me think it just hasn't been pulled yet, rather than being on one of the TSOP-DIP adapters (seeing as it's cheaper than either the AM29F032 OR the adapter board separately, it really can't be a preassembled adapter board).
<br />
<br />I just received a lot of 10 AM29F032's, which is probably more than I'll ever need, and I ordered the BuyICNow adapter boards to go with them.  If you're just interested in one or two, shoot me a PM and I'd be willing to sell you a couple (yes, I know I'm brand new here, long time guest, but I'm good for it, PM me and you can decide if you feel comfortable with it).  I'm still waiting on the boards from BuyICNow, and if you want it programmed, that would take a little longer (I don't have a programmer up and running yet...), but we could work something out.
<br />
<br />Also, you should take a look a this project: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=9013">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=9013</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Even if you don't want to have a USB port in your cart, you could still solder in female headers in the pin slots rather than male pin headers and then you'd have a cheap USB programmer for 29F032's already mounted on to an adapter board.

<br />So yeah, sounds like they are indeed selling the 29f032 chip soldered into the TSOP adaptor.
<br />
<br />So yeah, would this be as simple as buying this chip and adaptor combo, and sending them the English-patched ROM to burn? Or is is it a bit more complex/are other precautions involved?

<br />Seiken Densetsu 3 (AKA Secret of Mana 2) namely. Like, what are the general rules? Are there limits on what characters can be used in the file name? Maximum number of characters? What should the file extension be? Does the ROM need to be edited in some fashion? That kinda thing.

<br />It needs to be headerless (.sfc), not with a copier header (.smc, .swc, .fig, etc). And it needs to run in bsnes for two reasons: 1. bsnes enforces a lot of hardware limitations that ZSNES and Snes9x fail to enforce, and 2. bsnes needs ROMs to be headerless.

Old floppy disk based copiers stored information in the first 512 bytes of the file.

<br />I don't know how their system works, but I'd recommend making sure the name uses only basic Latin (ASCII) characters, not Japanese characters or anything like that.

<br />I've heard of this, but I didn't think the parts were available to the general public?
<br />
<br />Okay, I'm trying to find a suitable Seiken Densetsu 3 ROM to use the English patch on, and I've found two. One with a ".smc" extension and one with a ".sfc" extension, both 4mb. Now, I would think the ".sfc" version would be the better one, since it should be closer to what was on the original cartridge (I'm worried that the .smc version isn't as accurate of a dump as the .sfc version), but the English patcher doesn't handle .sfc files! What's up with that? Am I suppose to patch the .smc, remove it's header and rename it's extension to ".sfc"?
<br />
<br />*EDIT* I've found a tool called "SNES Purify" by the bsnes guy. I loaded up the English-patched Seiken Densetsu 3 .smc, and it found that the file had a header, and it's file extension was wrong, and corrected both. The game now plays in bsnes. I take it that this program has, well, purified the .smc and is the same as if it were freshly dumped as a .sfc? I'd hate to get this new .sfc burned then find I was suppose to go about the process a different way and the cart won't play <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />Alright, so I've got the English patched ROM. It's the correct size, it's been though SNES Purify (headers removed, renamed ".sfc"), it plays correctly in BSNES, is this bad boy ready to rumble? Is it simply a matter of burning the .sfc and soldering the whole shebang into the donor Seiken Densetsu 3 Super Famicom cart?
