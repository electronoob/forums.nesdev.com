<br />Game rules themselves are methods of operation and not copyrightable; see US Copyright Office publication <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl108.html" class="postlink">FL108: Games</a>. Using characters that resemble distinctive existing characters more than required for the genre is infringement. <em>Atari v. Philips</em>. But using characters that look like pre-existing stereotypes is not infringement. <em>Capcom v. Data East</em>.
<br />
<br />As for which side of the line Tetris clones fall on, this hasn't been decided in court, but consider that it's exactly the same as Dr. Mario but with a slightly larger field, different shapes (which had been well known even before Mr. Pajitnov released the first version), and different line clearing rules (which also appear in Pac-Attack). Super Puzzle Fighter II is very close to Baku Baku Animal, so you're safe there (but if you're worried, check with a real lawyer). I will let on that my entry has nothing to do with Tetris, Dr. Mario, Puyo Pop, or any other falling polyomino game.
<br />
<br />Point of terminology: As I understand it, "Turbo" is the arcade and PS1 versions, which don't slow down with a lot of exploding, but the GBA version isn't "Turbo" because of all its slowdown.

<br />
<br />Nobody should blame you, because it's <em>always</em> possible to find a common element between a newer game and an older concept. Since we're all gamers, it wouldn't be wrong to assume we all get our inspiration from other games. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />Just because a game is similar to another game doesn't mean it's a belligerent ripoff. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

Doesn't mean they're low quality or ripoffs, they're just new versions of games that inspired them with maybe more stuff. Sometimes clones are even higher quality then originals. Can't bring up any GREAT examples, but there's a couple. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Well, the game is still conceptually simple.  The devil, as they say, is in the details.  Some parts of nesdev might seem simple to those of you who have completed finished games, but for me I learned a great deal, and still have far to go.
<br />
<br />This is my first serious NES project.  And for my first full game, I think that I choose fairly well.  The game mechanics are fairly simple.  I have a known quantity that I am comparing my results to (the original).  I'm not taking on a project that is too large for my experience level.
<br />
<br />In the future, I hope to have time to do something more ambitious.  I have a few ideas in mind, but I don't want to leak them right now - other than to say that they are original ideas and not clones of anything.

I have a million idea for cool NES games, but chances are that few will ever see the light.<br /><br />In the end a new game will always be a modified "clone" of an existing game I guess. What counts is to do something else than plain copy things. For example Dr Mario could be considered a Tetris clone, but it's very different, you destroy blocks by matching them instead of by completing rows, and you win when all viruses are deleted, which makes it funnier to play than tetris (IMO). The music is also goddamn good, instead of copying Tcheakovsky's music, which makes it way better. Puyo Puyo is also an improvement of tetris, but it's different, it has this cute aspect the other puzzle games lacks, which makes it a huge improvement as well.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Point of terminology: As I understand it, "Turbo" is the arcade and PS1 versions, which don't slow down with a lot of exploding, but the GBA version isn't "Turbo" because of all its slowdown.</div>
<br />Huh ? The GBA version is turbo as well. The game is nommed like that just because it's based on Super Street Fighter Alpha Turbo 2. They just removed the "alpha" and repaced "street" by "puzzle".

<br />
<br />I disagree.  I think that I have a really inventive idea for a game.  In fact, I'm not worried about someone "stealing it", I just don't want to leak it before I have a chance to document it and scrutinize it.
<br />
<br />In my mind, a game is only a "clone" if the author had knowledge of a previous example, and that he or she intended for the new game to have something in common (game play wise) with the original.
<br />
<br />For example, never in my life before have I ever played a video game about "curling" (some weirdo winter Olympic sport).  I don't know if they exist.  But suppose that I made a NES game about curling.  Then someone points out, "hey, that exists on the PSP", then did I make a clone?  I based the game off a Wikipedia page, not an existing game that I've sampled.
<br />
<br />idk, maybe I'm just splitting hairs.
<br />
<br />And, no, I have no plans to make such a NES game.  Although, I think that it might be kinda funny if someone else did.

<br />It's less of a blog style, and more of an actual website. I think everyone would like it, I just need to get it set up.  Maybe memblers would like to host it temporarily till Dain gets things going.
<br />
<br />The only reason I'm pushing for nintendoage as a host, is that it will always exist, and it will get more publicity that way.
