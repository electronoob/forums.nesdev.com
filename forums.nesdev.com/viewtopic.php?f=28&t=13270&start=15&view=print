You won't get VRC4 games work on VRC2. <br /><br />The inverse surely is possible (with ROM hacking) as I've done it myself.<br /><br />VRC4 has the IRQ timer and is capable of using bigger PRG/CHR ROMs.

That word is actually over 200 hundred years old pre-dating Compact Cassettes by a long margin. lol<br /><br />To be fair, in spoken Portuguese the sound for both words are very similar.
