		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I started thinking about what would constitute an accurate palette from PAL / SECAM gamut space.<br />This test is directly from the hardware capable PAL gamut, at 12 equal steps along the possible range.<br /><br />Row 10 ~ 1F is PAL gamut: <br />xR-0.64<br />yR-0.33<br />xG-0.29<br />yG-0.60<br />xB-0.15<br />yB-0.06<br />White point D65 (X0.3127, Y0.329)<br /><br />Then row 0, 2 &amp; 3 are luminance steps based on row 1. <br /><br />This palette also includes a hack for getting a better 00 ~ 30, 0D~3D range. Reckless!! Use at own risk  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> <br /><br /><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/9zauv0d3o9ejqoi/NES-SECAMPALHK-large.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/6fzvirk2yipucyo/NES-SECAMPALHK.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Attached is the PAL gamut palette in .aco, .act &amp; .pal formats.<br />I think I have the .pal file laid out correctly, but not really sure how to convert for FCEUX to test out.

(If you'd care to share the source, I'm sure there's people here who wouldn't mind correcting them.)<br /><br />Again, $30 is the same as $20 <em>by design</em>, so this &quot;whiter than white&quot; idea makes no sense.<br /><br />Super Mario Bros. uses $0F for black, and $30 for white. (So do a <em>lot</em> of games.) I'm certain that $0E is acceptable too, but I don't have a common example offhand.<br /><br />I mentioned Jaws only as a weird case that I happened to notice uses both $20 and $30 on the same screen.<br /><br />Nintendo didn't really have a way to test for and reject $0D either. For example, the common TMNT uses $0D and it made it through all licencing tests and was one of the highest selling games for the system. It doesn't use large amounts of it on the screen, just for sprite outlines, so I don't think it tends to cause the common desync problems, but my point is I don't believe they did any sort of categorical test for the use of $0D.
