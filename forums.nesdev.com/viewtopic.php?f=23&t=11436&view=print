		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I heard a story today that sometimes when you download a rom from somewhere, people hacked it to pop-up pictures of penis's or something inappropriate in the middle of the game. I've found no record of such things. Sounds made up to me. Anybody heard of this before?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's technically doable (how realistic the penises will be will obviously depend on the console's graphical capabilities), but I doubt many people would waste their time just to troll random people for a few seconds. I don't know of any hacks with surprise inappropriate images, but there's the occasional &quot;Naked Mario&quot;, where characters are drawn naked.

But then perhaps it shouldn't be so surprising given a couple things. For one thing, it could be a backlash against Nintendo's track record for <a href="http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/maniac.html" class="postlink">censorship</a> prior to <em>Mortal Kombat II</em>, which is when Nintendo first allowed a game to go out with the equivalent to the modern M rating on the label. For another, recall <a href="https://allthetropes.orain.org/wiki/Rule_34" class="postlink">rule 34</a> of user-generated content on the Internet: if you can think of it, there's pornography of it.<br /><br />One interesting case is <em>Nuts and Milk</em>. The original version was safe for work, but the first version I saw was the hack where the characters were turned into penises. At first, I thought it was one of those pirate-original &quot;H games&quot; out of Asia. &quot;Oh, I get it: 'nuts' and 'milk'.&quot;<br /><br />As an NES homebrew game developer, I prefer safe-for-work ideas when I troll players:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysmelia" class="postlink">Body plan differences</a> that are considered <a href="https://allthetropes.orain.org/wiki/Unusually_Uninteresting_Sight" class="postlink">usual in-universe</a> but which may fall into the <a href="https://allthetropes.orain.org/wiki/Uncanny_Valley" class="postlink">uncanny valley</a> for some players. This may include a race of people born with <a href="http://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=Category:Pictures_of_polis" class="postlink">no legs</a>, or a race of people with conjoined legs who live near beaches and are responsible for mermaid myths. How creepy would <a href="http://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=Stilt-bottom" class="postlink">humans appear through alien eyes</a>? </li><li>Vague parallels to historic tragedies, such as winning your freedom from ethnic detainment through a game of mental skill (accused of Nazi overtones) or rescuing a kitten hiding from a bully who would later grow up to serve a life sentence for assassinating someone famous. </li><li>Unsafe activities made safe, such as Russian roulette with a <a href="http://pineight.com/mw/?title=File:Roulette_%282011%29.png" class="postlink">toy gun</a> or a paintball marker. </li><li>Cartoon characters acting wildly out of character for reasons that the ending justifies. </li></ul>
