<br />
<br />I've got a French PAL NES and I'm trying to hook it up a computer (I've got no real TV) . I've been told French NES only output RGB. Would there be a quite simple hack to get composite out of the NES ? The PPU is a 2C07. 
<br />
<br />Thanks for your help !

<br />
<br />If you want, you could buy a French NES (if you can find one) and desolder the modules then swap them around.
<br />
<br />
<br />French NES also uses a custom video cable only available in the same places it was. Unless you want to do some creative rewiring, its advisable to get one of those as well.
<br />If you're in PAL territory I'm guessing you'd have SCART. IIRC thats what the FR NES video cable outputs to.

<br />
<br />Thanks for your answer <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> 
<br />
<br />To be more precise my two NES are actually French, with PAL RGB on SCART and no composite. I'm in France, so that's my only easy option. 
<br />
<br />The problem is I own no TV set, so I cannot use SCART. What I wanted to do was to use a computer as display. The computer I planned to use is a Silicon Graphics Indy with built-in video-in but it has only composite and S-video (like most computers anyway).
<br />
<br />So, I did a bit of reverse-engineering yesterday. I soldered an RCA female plug on the pin connecting the motherboard to the AV module. This is the pin closest to the corner of the module.
<br />
<br />So now, I've got composite out of my NES. Victory !
<br />
<br />The only thing is that I find the colors a bit strange. Dimmed, like. Maybe the signal level is a bit low. Maybe I'm missing a bit of electronics.
<br />
<br />Has someone got the schematics of the module of a composite version for me to compare and maybe complete the circuitry ? 
<br />
<br />I could find the schematics of the motherboard, but not of the AV/RF/AC module.
<br />
<br />Thanks !

<br />Why not connect the SCART directly to your computer's monitor? Or does your monitor not go down to arcade scan rates like 15.6 Hz?

<br />
<br />You mean connecting the RGB pins from the SCART to the input of the computer ? If the the signals are compatible between SCART and VGA it would be a good idea.
<br />
<br />Actually, I didnt consider this, because the computer I want to use (the Indy) is hooked up to a LCD screen that uses a proprietary input (not VGA or other usual stuff) where RGB values are transmitted on a digital bus over 24 wires (or is it 48 ?). This is 15y old equipement. At that time there was no standard among LCD screens. The video card is also proprietary and works only with this screen.

SCART RGB is a "standard resolution" signal with a 15.6 kHz horizontal frequency, the same used by old CGA monitors, Apple IIGS RGB monitors, and standard resolution arcade monitors. The lowest resolution VGA modes has a minimum scan rate roughly twice this. Some monitors, especially those made by Wells Gardner, can handle 15.6 Hz, but a lot of VGA monitors can't.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Actually, I didnt consider this, because the computer I want to use (the Indy) is hooked up to a LCD screen that uses a proprietary input (not VGA or other usual stuff) where RGB values are transmitted on a digital bus over 24 wires (or is it 48 ?).</div><br />So that's what they had before DVI, right?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">This is 15y old equipement.

<br />
<br />AFAIK it is the only standalone (ie not in a laptop computer) LCD of the early 90's. So I guess there was no standard at all. I seem to remember around USD 10000 at the time. Screen and board alone. The computer was the same.

<br />
<br />I'm no expert. From what I read, the French NES is the only one with native RGB output. I'm pretty sure now that the SCART pin for composite is not wired at all.
<br />
<br />In the small AV/RF/AC box there is a Sony V7021 chip whose purpose is to convert the composite output by the PPU to RGB for the SCART.
<br />
<br />I think it is an interesting piece for those who want RGB and only have composite.

<br />The french NES is indeed RGB out on the scart connector.   This is because france wanted to be different from everyone else and use SECAM instead of PAL.  It's like PAL just with an extra refreshing zing.  Sooo, the french NES has a regular ol' PAL gut with a PAL PPU, which sends its composite to the modulator, where a PAL to RGB decoder lives.  This decodes the signal into RGB which is fed to the TV.
<br />
<br />You can recover the PAL video but as someone already found out, it's lower level than what a TV likes and is dark as a result.  You need to boost it a tad to use it.

<br />SECAM has the same scan frequency as PAL but uses FM instead of QAM for the color subcarrier, which hides things like dot crawl, hue distortion, and a few other artifacts seen in NTSC. In addition to the color encoding difference, which shows up in baseband composite video, broadcast PAL and SECAM also differ on a few aspects in the RF domain (frequencies, x vs. 1.0-x modulation, etc).
