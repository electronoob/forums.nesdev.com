		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Has anyone ever considered making a GB emulator for the NES? It would obviously not run anywhere near 60fps, since no matter how you approach rendering the graphics, just emulating a (slightly crippled) Z80 on a (slightly crippled) 6502 will be painfully slow. Still, I think this would be interesting to see, but I wonder what the best way to handle the graphics would be...<br /><br />Considering that the NES can do almost everything the GB can, the logical solution would be to use the capabilities of the PPU directly. There are a couple of small problems that are easily solvable (or can be ignored!), like the 32x32 tile maps (which can be done by making all palettes the same and forcing the vertical scroll past 240) and the 10 sprites per scanline limit (the result will be more flickery than on a real GB). There is however something I consider a big problem, which is the inability to mask the sides of the screen. Having garbage around the game play area is too off-putting IMO. Another big problem is the window, which can't really overlap the screen.<br /><br />The other approach, which would make things significantly slower, would be to do everything in software. Reserve 360 tiles (a split will be necessary) for drawing the 160x144 gameplay area and dynamically render everything there. In addition to the speed issue, there's also the fact that 8KB of CHR is not enough to hold a second 160x144 off-screen buffer, but nothing stops us from using more CHR, even though that's not very common in iNES ROMs.<br /><br />What are your thoughts on this? There are many points to consider regarding the CPU and audio as well.

Rewrite the graphics and sound engines and statically recompile the game code. <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=119339#p119339" class="postlink">Chris Covell thinks</a> this is how <em>Balloon Kid</em> was translated into <em>Hello Kitty World</em>. For example, both <em>BK</em> and <em>HKW</em> end up using the same music engine as the respective platform's version of <em>Dr. Mario</em>.

Take any GB ROM and it will run with correctly represented graphics, no matter how slow (sound is most likely not necessary, because it will sound like crap at such low speeds). how would you approach that?

(See Pokemon Stadium.)<br /><br />If you must stick with the NES to make your pure-software Wide Boy, you'd probably need to use software rendering and extra memory on the cart at $6000-$7FFF to represent the Game Boy's RAM and VRAM. The MMC5's window in SL mode may be flexible enough to represent the Game Boy's window for some games, but nowhere near for all games.

Emulating a GB on the NES is not about the goal (playing Game Boy games), but the means (NES simulating another machine). I thought of the Game Boy because it has slightly lower graphical capabilities than the NES, but other platforms with decent libraries of cool games would be interesting to see emulated as well.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If you must stick with the NES to make your pure-software Wide Boy, you'd probably need to use software rendering and extra memory on the cart at $6000-$7FFF to represent the Game Boy's RAM and VRAM.</div><br />Yeah, to make things look right the video would have to be rendered in software. But I wonder if there's a way to make it look mostly correct while taking advantage of hardware graphics acceleration (i.e. make use of name tables and sprites instead of rendering pixel by pixel to a surface of 360 tiles).

I know there are many old text-only, monochrome or with hardwired tilesets that are easier to emulate but are incredibly uninteresting (no exciting software). Since the emulator itself would not be convenient at all, if the emulated platform isn't relevant, there's no point in considering this.

I know the Atari 800 line had a <a href="http://www.atariarchives.org/mapping/appendix8.php" class="postlink">display list</a> feature that seems it would be hard to emulate with the PPU, but perhaps games that stuck to a more compatible mode for the entire screen wouldn't be too hard to run. There is also the problem of dealing with the BIOS that a lot of software would utilize as well (and I would assume the same for the Apple II).
