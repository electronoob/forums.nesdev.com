<br />Yes, the GB is clocked faster than the NES, but comparing just the clock speed of CPUs with completely different architectures is a poor way of benchmarking them. I think most people would say that the overall processing power is equivalent.

<br />A Z80 needs a clock speed twice as fast as a 6502 to keep up.  They're about the same if the Z80 is twice the clock speed of the 6502.  Some tasks are slightly faster on the double-clocked Z80 and some are slightly faster on the 6502.  For example, block copy is almost twice as fast on a double-clocked Z80 compare to a half-clocked 6502.

<br />Wacky Race for GBC: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Btd45BomdMo" class="postlink">YouTube</a>
<br />
<br />The Stunt Race FX demo is really impressive, but as said on the intro, it's better on original Game Boy (up to the pocket version), on Game Boy Color/GBA it works but graphics are glitched/ some lines are missing and some parts of the music does not play.

<br />To be honnest this GBC game looks awesome. It looks like the GBC had an hardware mode 7 (which of course it don't). Compared to this Cosmic Epsilon looks like  a piece of s***t. In fact even compared to Rad Racer I find personally it looks so-so.

<br />Are you really suggesting that the old and simple road distortion technique with a little extra texturing is technically more impressive than that GB demo? Come on!
<br />
<br />On YouTube they're also comparing the demo to Toy Story Racer on the GBC, which makes absolutely no sense since that game is 100% pre-rendered.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wacky Races isn't that impressive to me, it looks basically like Rad Racer.  Completely flat ground, effects easily achieved with raster distortion techniques.
<br />
<br />I wish people would stop calling these Mode 7, or even saying they look like Mode 7.  Mode 7 means the entire ground is one big texture that can be rotated, with a bit of camera control for angles and zooming in and out, and that's it.  SNES games with Mode 7 still have completely flat ground but it's noticeably more realistic than Wacky Races.  When you turn, you don't just slide side to side over a road with perfect perspective.  Your viewpoint turns with you and you actually see the road at a different angle.
<br />
<br />The GB demo is both better and worse than Mode 7.  It supports simulated hills, valleys and jumps, much like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ma1Lyz9Oaw" class="postlink">Road Rash on the Genesis.</a>  It even looks like it supports some basic 3D polygon rendering, in the scenery that passes by at about 1:00.  But it's still nowhere near as good as Mode 7 because all camera angles are a sort of simulated 3D - you could never pause the game and rotate the view around the car, it's always straight on or a carefully designed curve that isn't really much of a turn.
