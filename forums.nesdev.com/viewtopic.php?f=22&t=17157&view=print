I'd just like to add that this has been a big learning experience for me over the years I've been working on it and I've learnt a lot. Though as I learnt more I did not go back and rewrite routines or reorganise code and this will be evident when looking at the source. There's a lot of redundant, inefficient, duplicate code and some outright silly mistakes within.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Version 1.1 Changes</span>:-<br /><ul>- Fixed graphical screen wrap issue with the boulder and the ducks' Projectile.<br />- Fixed a glitch with the top-left boar in stage 2-9 where it would continuously charge at nothing.<br />- Damage from the boar has been reduced from 10 to 8.<br />- Damage from the ducks' projectile has been reduced from 8 to 6.<br />- Damage from the duck has been increased from 6 to 8.<br />- Damage from the Sheep has been reduced from 8 to 7.<br />- Damage from the fly has been reduced from 7 to 6.<br />- Damage from the gull has been reduced from 10 to 9.<br />- The interval between the ducks' shots has been increased from 64 to 72 frames.<br />- Respawn time for the flowers on stage 2-9 has been increased by 12 frames.<br />- Respawn time for the flowers on stage 4-3 has been decreased by 575 frames.<br />- Landing lag from the player attacking has been decreased from 7 to 4.<br /></ul><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Version 1.2 Changes</span>:-<br /><ul>- <em><strong>Easy mode</strong></em> has been added! <br />    <ul>    - <em><strong>(Easy)</strong></em> Damage multiplier has been lowered to 0.6 (single-player) and 0.5 (multi-player).<br />    - <em><strong>(Easy)</strong></em> Modified the behavior of a few of the enemies.<br />    - <em><strong>(Easy)</strong></em> Reduced the speed of many of the enemies.<br />    - <em><strong>(Easy)</strong></em> Reduced the amount of stages that have weather effects.<br />    </ul>- Added snow to stage 4-2 of multiplayer.<br />- Increased the tempo of the music for PAL consoles by 12% approx.<br />- Removed a single fish from the stages 4-1 (single-player) and 4-2 (multi-player).<br />- <em><strong>(Normal)</strong></em> The interval between the ducks' shots has been decreased to 66 from 72 frames.<br /></ul>

Half the of the effort writing music is coming up with and deciding on the theme itself. A loop is also much less daunting to interpret than a 3-minute song. <br /><br />Out of curiosity, do you hard-type music as code/data or do you use famitracker to come up with it?<br /><br />Glad to hear you want this in on the a53 cartridge, it'll be a great addition. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

For me, the music was the most difficult part of making the game.<br /><br />To create the music I mess around on a keyboard until I find something I like. Then I recreate that in famitracker and play around with it a bit more. It's a little more work but I find it difficult to create music solely using famitracker.<br /><br />It fills me with joy to think that <em>Nim &amp; Nom</em> will be on the a53 cartridge.
