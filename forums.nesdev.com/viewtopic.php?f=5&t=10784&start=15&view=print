If you see a number, that's bad.<br /><br />Test all electrolytic capacitors (the cylinders). Set the multimeter to 200Ω. Put the black lead on the side with the stripe, and the red lead on the other lead. It should initially read 0 and then slowly increase. If it doesn't, that's bad.<br />Test the other two capacitors (the brown discs). Same procedure, but leads don't matter which go to which pin, and set the multimeter to 200kΩ instead.<br /><br />Test the inductor L2. Set the multimeter to 2000kΩ and measure the resistance across the two pins of the inductor. It should start high and rapidly drop.<br />Test the transformer whose part number I can't see (but it's got &quot;75K&quot; on top). Do a similar test as for L2, but for the contacts that are on the same side.<br />er, let me try drawing a picture:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">o o o<br />+---+<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />+---+<br />o o o</div> I don't know if there are three on each side, but only measure all the ones on the same side.<br />Finally, make sure that the resistance between all the pins on the top and all the pins on the bottom is more than 2000kΩ<br /><br />Go ahead and test the only resistor, it's the big white block. Unfortunately, I can't see what resistance it's supposed to be because of the angle of the photos. Make sure that the resistance on it is approximately the same as what's specified.<br /><br />If all of these test out, the only thing remaining is the two big black blocks, which I'm not certain what to do with.

If it's still doing the wrong thing, then I'd replace it.<br />(the label on it: &quot;<span style="color: #FF0000">1</span><span style="color: #00FF00">0</span><span style="color: #00FFFF">4</span> 25V&quot; means a <span style="color: #FF0000">1</span><span style="color: #00FF00">0</span>×10<span style="color: #00FFFF">⁴</span> pF capacitor rated to a maximum of 25V. If it is broken, you can replace it with any other 0.1µF non-polarized capacitor that's rated for 25V or more)<br /><br />What are you using for voltage conversion? Can you turn it down below 1/2 input voltage? (e.g. a variac?) If so, at what input voltage does it blow the fuse?<br /><br />Another fantastic trick I've learned for debugging power supplies of whatever provenance: put a 60W incandescent non-halogen light bulb in series with the power supply. The light bulb will keep you from blowing a fuse, and brown-out the supply instead. Then you can use thermal debugging to figure out what's gone wrong.<br /><br />I'm not certain how the light bulb will work with voltage conversion... nevermind if you can even find a 120V light bulb there. I think it should still work if you put it in series with the 240V input to the voltage converter...
