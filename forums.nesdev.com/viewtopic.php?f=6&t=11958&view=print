		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Early emulators and several clone consoles seem to mix up two of the square wave's duty cycles, making the sound sound off.  However, I must be in the minority since I actually like the inaccurate, inverted sound, and I believe certain songs sound better (Over Horizon stage 1, for example).  So instead of me busting out a clone console, what would be an emulator (for Windows) that doesn't accurately emulate sound?  I tried Nesticle, but it doesn't work on my computer, probably cause it's so old and probably cause it was made for DOS.  If NES emulators with inaccurate sound are now extinct, is there any way to make an emulator sound inaccurate, or at least swap the duty cycles around?

It's my emulator of choice, but sadly it faces a lot of crackling in it's audio while changing the focus of the window. Is anyone aware of how to fix these issues? I've tried altering everything from buffering to the output quality, but nothing seems to work. Oftentimes I'll mute the emulator entirely because of it's crackling.

Or minimizing the window. Or maximizing the window. It could easily be a bug, since Windows exhibits some funky behavior when the window is moved (the window message loop is blocked), maybe they didn't take that into account.<br /><br />I've had much more severe problems with audio in Nestopia. It's very easy to get the audio to hiccup severely. NSF playback in particular seems to be broken.<br /><br />Of course none of this really is about inaccuracies in sound emulation.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, the &quot;static&quot; in FCEUX during play is a result of odd synchronisation/timing issues pertaining to audio/video drivers and/or latency (regardless of what audio card I used (onboard Realtek or an Audigy SE)).  So it makes sense Vsync enable/disable would affect it.  Some of it has been fixed using FCEUX 2.2.3 SVN (I get binaries from emucr.com) and setting Vsync to &quot;Lazy Wait for Vblank&quot; and setting DirectDraw to &quot;No hardware acceleration&quot;.  I have similar synchronisation oddities in other emulators, which is mainly why I use Nestopia when actually wanting to play a NES/FC game, and FCEUX +other emulators solely for debugging/development.  That's just me though.
