<br />Also if jumped the gun and removed the CHR chip before I knew what I was doing can I just replace it with a blank 27c64.
<br />
<br />thanx eh
<br />
<br />My goal for my virgin attempt at cart programming is to make my own copy of California Raisins.
<br />
<br />Oh and bye the way im sort of new here Ive been reading this site for quite sometime I just didnt register till today. 
<br />
<br />Thanx for all the info and help you have on this  forum.

This is the case with all UNROM games.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also if jumped the gun and removed the CHR chip before I knew what I was doing can I just replace it with a blank 27c64.</div>
<br />That wouldn't work, because the 27Cxxx are ROMs, they are erasable with UV light, yes, but still ROM. The program won't be able to store anything there, and the graphics would look all wrong.
<br />
<br />You should either put the original RAM chip back (if it wasn't destroyed when removed) or a similar RAM chip. Chips used as WRAM in games such as SMB3 would work. Of course, any other CHR-RAM game will have the chip you want. But if you are to use another cart, you'd better get another UNROM one, just forget about the other one and do it right this time around.
<br />
<br />Have you removed the CHR-RAM chip? Was it damaged?

If you still have that chip floating around, you might want to place it back in, since programs made for the unrom boards only have PRG-ROM data stored on one chip.
<br />
<br />It can't be replaced with a blank 27c64 since those chips require not only a programming voltage, but also can only be programmed once before needing to be erased, in this case with an ultra-violet light.

<br />
<br />While I have the attention of some pros. here, these are examples of what im reading.
<br />· Desolder the PRG chip from the board.
<br />· On the EPROM, bend up pin 1, 2, 24, 31, 32.
<br />· Solder the EPROM onto the board where the PRG rom was.
<br />· Place wire from pin 1 to pin 30, 31, 32 on the EPROM.
<br />· Place a wire from pin 2 to hole 24 on the board.
<br />· Place a wire from pin 16 to pin 24 on the EPROM.
<br />or
<br />UNROM (mapper 2):
<br />Bend up pins 1, 2, 24 and 31
<br />Solder pin 2 to hole 22 (A16)
<br />Solder pin 24 to GND (OE)
<br />
<br />
<br />What is right for my application.
<br />
<br />Am I right in that this chips is the one I will need 
<br />EPROM 27C010/27C1001 128KBytes (32pin):
<br />
<br />Is there a 28 pin chip I can program and just drop in so there will be no bending of pins. I want this to be a permenant application to, no need to be pulling the chip out and reflashing with another game.
<br />
<br />thanx eh

<br />No, there is not. Nintendo didn't need the /OE pin, nor they needed VPP because the chip were factory programmed. So they could reduce the number of pin down to 28, and they could made the UNROM board smaller (UOROM is the equivalent with 32 pin PRGROM, allowing up to 256kB. So if you really don't want to bend up pins, the only way to go is to found an UOROM game (that is MUCH, MUCH rarer).
<br />
<br />EDIT : You could just go the lazy way and order a <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1216&amp;start=0" class="postlink">UNROM board from Memblers Industries (aka Memblers)</a>. You won't need any rewiring or anything, just solder the ROM down. However, I think it'd be somewhat more expensive.

<br />
<br />When I view my rom with the current version of NEStopia i get this:
<br />
<br />System:      NTSC
<br />Board/Chips: UxROM
<br />Mapper:      2
<br />PRG-ROM:     128k, CRC: 0xF2096D9C
<br />CHR-RAM:     8k
<br />
<br />So I assumed this meant that I would need this eprom:
<br />
<br />27C128 128k (16k x 8-Bit) EPROM
<br />
<br />However I read some more and came across some text and got it into my head that this may be the eprom I should be using:
<br />
<br />27C1001 200ns 1Mb (128k x 8-Bit) EPROM
<br />
<br />So call me dumb laugh at me all you want but please give me a straight answer, as I am new to this and this will be my first atempt at making myself an unreleased cart.
<br />
<br />thanx eh

<br />Well, the dumb is the EPROM retailer that doesn't make a clear difference between kilobytes and kilobits.
<br />128 kilobits is 16 kilobytes, and that won't be large enough. However, 1 Megabits is 128 kilobytes, wich is the one you want to programm an UNROM game.
