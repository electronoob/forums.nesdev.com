A wiki is a type of web application/web site for organizing information in a certain easily editable way. One software package of this type is called MediaWiki, though many other similar software packages exist. MediaWiki is the software which powers, among many others, the web site Wikipedia. The name Wikipedia in turn is a portmanteau of <span style="text-decoration: underline">wiki</span> and encyclo<span style="text-decoration: underline">pedia</span>. Many other sites, such as our own <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Nesdev_Wiki" class="postlink">Nesdev wiki</a> and <a href="https://tcrf.net/The_Cutting_Room_Floor" class="postlink">The Cutting Room Floor</a>, are also examples of wikis. The web site Wikia offers hosting of wiki sites for countless special interests and fandoms. You can easily set up a wiki on your own if you have some web space and need a place to dump information. And so on.<br /><br />Wikipedia is a proper name. Wiki is not. Saying &quot;Citing wiki&quot; when you mean &quot;Citing Wikipedia&quot; is like saying &quot;Citing dictionary&quot; when you mean &quot;Citing The Oxford Dictionary&quot;. No, not even &quot;Citing <em>the</em> dictionary&quot;. &quot;Citing dictionary&quot; is the analogous phrase here. Sounds silly, doesn't it?<br /><br />Thank you for your attention, your friendly neighborhood grammar Nazi.

You can't turn back the clock, and you can't standardize folk language. <br /><br />When saying something like &quot;i read this thing on wiki&quot;, wikipedia is always implied, and it is clear that it is an abbreviation of wikipedia exactly because the other hypothetical implication would be grammatically incorrect. There's no actual conflict. <br />When saying &quot;i read this thing on <em>a</em> wiki [page]&quot;, on the other hand, you mean just that.

The only time I've heard this is from completely non-technical people that completely don't understand what they're talking about. (ie the type of people that call Internet Explorer &quot;the internet&quot;)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I would still advocate resisting such changes because it can erase a potential understanding of the etymology of a word. Wiki might become in the public mind nothing more than an abbreviation of Wikipedia, and so the assumption is formed that the concept of wikis is named after Wikipedia, instead of the other way around. It's true that you can't exactly standardize folk language, but everyone has a an opportunity to make a well-reasoned choice about their own use of language, and perhaps even influence others.

Typically, there's three groups i don't see using it: journalists, people in formal roles, and CS/tech people. Maybe it's less common in english everyday use, i wouldn't know about that.<br /><br />You might've convinced me to be more mindful of such use on boards like these, but out there, i think it's a lost cause.<br /><br />&lt;rant&gt;<br />Actually, i have a few similar pet peeves. Like the use of &quot;propaganda&quot; which essentially just means &quot;a message brought forward/propagated to spread an idea or cause&quot;, reading late 19th/early 20th century texts*. But since it has been used in a political context, it's then &quot;a political message brought forward&quot;. But again, since it's generally political opponents calling something propaganda, it's &quot;a misleading or outright false message brought forward, and the ones doing it are crooks&quot;. Which used as a strategy to delegitimize a claim then becomes analogous with words like &quot;hogwash&quot; and &quot;BS&quot;. <br /><br />When reading old texts using the word, someone not knowing this will think of the modern prejorative value it has gotten, which is so dominant that the word can't be used as originally intended and be expected to be understood.<br /><br />*It borrows value from an old term in the catholic church; &quot;propaganda fide&quot;, or the propagation of faith.<br />&lt;/rant&gt;

For example:<br /><br /><ul><li>&quot;ain't no&quot; means &quot;is not a&quot; but carries the connotation &quot;I'm not speaking carefully based on educated reason. Instead, I'm letting my reactive mind do the talking.&quot;</li><li>The N-word means &quot;person of sub-Saharan African descent&quot; but carries the connotation &quot;...who ought to be a slave because of his skin color.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Wiki&quot; in this context means &quot;Wikipedia&quot; but also &quot;I am not aware of WikiWikiWeb and MeatBallWiki which directly preceded it nor Fandom powered by Wikia which followed it.&quot;</li></ul>

Ironically, this exception tends to come up a lot when maintaining a <em>wiki</em>. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><br />In conversation, however, you're trying to communicate an idea to one or more people. If they get it, you've succeeded. I think it's generally impolite to point out someone's impure/loose choice of word unless you were <em>actually</em> confused by it (or honestly believe someone else in the conversation is), or in a rarer case if you know they are learning the language and wish to have their mistakes corrected. It's pretty much an identical situation to pointing out someone's spelling mistakes.<br /><br />Sometimes it's fun to talk about what words mean, though, but that's best done as its own conversation (like this thread), otherwise it's often an impolite digression.<br /><br />Also, if you'd like to be tactful you can feign confusion: &quot;Which Wiki was it on?&quot; vs. &quot;You should have said Wikipedia.&quot;<br /><br />Usually attempting to understand the idea someone is trying to express results in a healthier conversation than criticizing the way they tried to express it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

But those sorts of cultural and linguistic biases are deeply encoded into North American culture, sadly.<br /><br />&quot;isn't a problem&quot; is pretty neutral and what I'd use in all but the most formal of settings; &quot;it's no problem&quot; is slightly more casual - I probably wouldn't use it in writing but is likely what I'd say conversationally. &quot;It is not a problem&quot; sounds almost satirically formal, robotic, and unnatural to me, particularly if spoken without a posh British accent.  Weirdly, &quot;it is no problem&quot;, despite just being an expansion of &quot;it's no problem&quot;, doesn't sound right to me <em>at all</em>, I think because the first half is extremely formal but the latter half is very casual and grammatically &quot;incorrect&quot;.
