		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You have what is most likely a first-generation Excitebike cartridge that contains a Famicom-to-NES adapter inside of it (rephrased: the PCB/cart itself is a 60-pin Famicom cartridge, attached to a 60-to-72-pin adapter to make it work on the NES).  These tend to sell for quite a lot of money (US$75 is common and what mine went for; it was of Stack-Up but that has no bearing).  There are ways to tell this, but the easiest way is to simply open the cart up and look.<br /><br />It's almost certainly not a bootleg (bootleg NES carts are much more uncommon than Famicom carts).<br /><br />Nintendo also used different shells/cartridges for Excitebike and several other first-gen titles; some are 5-screw, some are 3-screw.  Some (the very early originals) contained the Famicom 60-to-72-pin adapters I mentioned.  There's no difference between the cartridges otherwise; they're the same game.<br /><br />If you do have one that contains a Famicom 60-to-72-pin adapter in it: DO NOT disconnect the Famicom cartridge from the adapter without writing down which way/direction the cartridge was facing.  You CAN insert these cartridges into the adapters backwards (or the adapter into the NES backwards!) which will will cause damage (IIRC, permanently).  On the one I sold, I actually used sticky labels on the adapter to indicate what was pin 1 and which was &quot;front&quot; vs. &quot;back&quot;, to make it easier for the buyer to know how to use it.  <s>I might have pictures from an old backup if you want to see them.</s> -- Edit: I checked, and I don't.  It was eBay Auction #152476364390.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you for the quick reply, I also thought it might have been a famicom to nes adapter version but i opened it and it was the standard 72 pin board inside. I found it strange that ive owned it for maybe 5 plus years and never noticed it was different.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah I see.  Yeah, it's not strange -- Nintendo used both &quot;old style&quot; (5-screw) and &quot;newer style&quot; (3-reverse-torx screw) shells for &quot;older&quot; games.  It was during a transitional period during the tail end of first-generation launches.  It's normal.  Nothing unique there.
