I did notice that it messed up the rest of the tests using unofficial opcodes, but that's irrelevant for now since I'm just going on a straight path to basic emulation, rather than paying attention to all the &quot;less important&quot; side artifacts. <br /><br />BTW: Fixed the SUPER Mario Bros horizontal scrolling issue (still using the hack to test scrolling of course), which appeared to be very simple: I have a for-loop which fetches 33 horizontal tiles per scanline, and instead of grabbing the nametable (loopyV &amp; 0xC00) every single iteration, it grabbed the nametable only after every scanline, which made it wrap around the current nametable rather than the one to its &quot;right&quot;, causing nametables to wrap around instead of scroll to the next. I simply moved the line which grabbed the nametable into the loop. <br /><br />Wrong: <br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">int currentNameTable = loopyV &amp; 0xC00; <br /><br />for(int tileX = 0; tileX &lt; 33; tileX++) { <br /><br />//Proceed to fetch tile data from incorrect nametable<br /><br />}</div><br /><br />Right: <br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br />for(int tileX = 0; tileX &lt; 33; tileX++) { <br />int currentNameTable = loopyV &amp; 0xC00; <br /><br />//Proceed to fetch tile data from correct nametable<br /><br />}</div><br /><br />I highly doubt anyone would make such a simple mistake and not realize it immediately, but just in case, there you go ^. <br /><br />Now my original Mario Bros problem still remains.

Also, if you re-read what I said, I was saying that I DIDN'T want to worry about less important side artifacts (like unofficial opcodes) and focus on getting the basics to work perfectly. I am not yet planning on cycle/pixel-precise rendering if I can't even run one of the most basic games <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />To add to that, I'm going to rewrite the emulator when I have the basics running anyway. It was my plan from the start, and I've already rewritten it twice, simply because it's my first and I'm learning so many things on the way that a rewrite is much more viable and realistic (and helps refreshing my memory on code I haven't looked at for a while) than correcting the issues. When I look at the first version of my emu, it almost makes me vomit (so to speak).

Tracing my emulator's log next to FCEUX's debugger used to help, but this source is way too big and I have no idea where the bug could be. Other than that I tried disassembling the game and looking at the NMI handler/places where it reads controller input, but there are so many jumps and subroutines that it confused me. I bet it's something ridiculously simple that would make me facepalm the second I read it. I guess I'll write some unit tests for each opcode that could be relevant.

I just don't want to rely on someone else reviewing my code if it's not absolutely necessary. It's pretty basic 6502 interpretation code, nothing special whatsoever. I have yet to see a bug that I didn't manage to fix within a week. Like I said, once it gets really out of hand, I will definitely request more help (and hopefully people like you will be nice enough to be eager to help me) <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Of course, after that I noticed that NESTest does by no means test everything, and it was INCREDIBLY frustrating, but when I look back at it, it's like &quot;DAMN, how could I have missed that? That was so obvious!&quot;. I hope the same thing will apply to the APU... that stuff seems HARD AS HELL. <br /><br />Of course (as I've said many times before) this is my first emulator, and I could not tell you what a register or an instruction was before I started this project.
