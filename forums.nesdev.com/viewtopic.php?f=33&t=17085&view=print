This is just my experience and opinion so take it for what it is, but thinking that the top-down is the game is the game is part of the experience, and more importantly, realizing what the actual game is was a pleasant experience when i realized it on my own. It's a great plot twist and i think it's core to the whole concept.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hm... Not meaning to be contrarian, but i feel as though simplifying it as a <em>first episode spoiler</em> does the mechanism no justice. <br /><br />1)In star evil, the scenario is crafted to cause grave disbelief in the user. This will either<br />a) fuel the incentive to fool around with the controller/try different things, which will ultimately lead to the revelation. Blunting down that mechanism beforehand by instructing the user will deprive the user of that experience. <br />b) make the user resign to the idea that it is a reference joke, which the user will get if they already know about action 52 (which you ought to, given action 53:s reference if not other things). Which is fine all on itself, even if you don't get to play the &quot;real&quot; game. <br /><br />I think of it as an experience as much as a game. Or as separate but associated subgames. One game is figuring this stuff out. The other is what follows if you do.<br /><br />2) once they know, a new metagame appears: hand the controller to a friend and say &quot;hey, try this game..&quot;

The discussion shouldn't hurt, though. If someone makes a game with an unorthodox design next year, this discussion could serve as a knowledge base.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As was pointed out while I was typing, the comparisons are not equivocal.<br /><br />1. Unless we're considering naming vol. 4 &quot;Star Evil: Action 54 Vol. 4&quot; like vol. 1 was named for Streemerz, this is one of what will be many games on an anthology.<br /><br />2. The ROM will be available for free.  Anyone who does purchase it has the ability to play it first.<br /><br />3. The decision should absolutely be the developer's, especially considering the developer is not getting paid for the work. And the experience is obviously intentional, as is evident by pubby's description.txt.<br /><br />4. Games as an experience is a worthwhile endeavor, and even if it &quot;known for its twist&quot;, the twist still makes it better than--not a disappointment from--the expectation that's set up by it.<br /><br />And to reiterate, revealing the twist beforehand greatly diminishes the experience of playing the game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Most games don't need manuals. Growing up in a country where game piracy was rampant and few kids could read english, I hardly had access to game manuals until I got a Sega Genesis and started buying official TecToy cartridges (a lot of people I knew kept buying pirate carts during the 16-bit era though). Even without manuals, I still managed to play tons of games just fine.<br /><br />I don't see any problem in using a deceptive description for Star Evil. I believe that not knowing what's happening and figuring out stuff is the whole point of this game, and that includes figuring out the controls.

I still think that the introduction doesn't help it at all. Barriers to entry and misrepresenting what something's about make for a worse experience.<br /><br />So, IMNSHO, the manual text should <em>not</em> explain the controls at all, just give a hint that the game starts with a deception.
