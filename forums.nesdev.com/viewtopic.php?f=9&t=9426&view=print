So one day I finally had enough and scrubbed the board contacts with alcohol and steel wool, and it worked like a dream <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I would recommend separating the cart bay to motherboard connector and cleaning with cotton swabs and 80% alcohol. The steel wool was a bad idea (I was frustrated and thought it would never work again anyway) and did damage the connectors a bit.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I sold that unit to a local resell shop shortly thereafter (decided famiclones were way less of a hassle <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> ) so I'm not sure if that was a long-term solution or not.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a NES that makes a burnt plastic smell if you leave it powered on. Also I believe the CPU gets really hot. It does display a stable blank picture for awhile but then it starts going bonkers after awhile. I guess the CPU is fried and maybe something else is wrong with it. It was never hooked up with an improper power supply, it's possible it may have been zapped by static electricity at some point. <br /><br />When a NES doesn't work it could be a few things. Bad caps or maybe bad generic ICs can be replaced. But if your CPU or PPU dies it's toast. I'm guessing if either the CPU or PPU dies they will get very hot when powered up. I'd say repairing or getting a working original system is much better than messing with clones.

Even with a pristine connector and brand new cart I'd have to futz with the thing to get it to work right, and it drove me nuts. I guess I'm just impatient <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Although the inverted duty cycles in the clones make me sad. I find myself listening to NSF's of Mega Man 2 while playing on my TV <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> And TMNT is especially bad, but since I've beat that game finally I don't have to play it anymore <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

Iff that doesn't fix it and they play the first time, new connector time. And DO NOT PUSH THE GAMES DOWN. That's important if you like your connector not ruined.<br /><br />And yeah, what he said, make sure caps are okay and the regulator is well, regulating. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To be clear about my extra NES that doesn't work. The lockout chip does function and will cause the blinking light when the cart isn't set right or dirty. But no game cartridges will play, they are not dirty. I even tried a new connector. The system just has a gray screen and after time you smell that smell and I seem to recall one of the chips was hot, I believe the CPU. <br /><br />I did not check the voltage regulator. I guess I should look into it again and see if it's possible to figure out what is wrong with it. But I think that one of the two primary chips is probably toast. If you disagree and think it's more likely a regulator issue or something else let me know. But the system basically outputs a stable blank picture, though afterawhile I seem to recall the picture started having problems so maybe there is an issue with the regulator. It was an extra system so I'm not worried about it, I have a working NES console. This spare had a case that was severely abused and missing the door and part of the case that would have been required to replace the door.

I'm not saying a regulator won't go bad for other reasons and cause problems though.<br />I've fixed several grey screen top loaders, all had either a bad cpu or ppu, replacing it with a known good one from a front loader donor board resulted in a working top loader. My guess is internal shorts in the chips are causing the end fail, but what causes the internal short is anyone's guess.
