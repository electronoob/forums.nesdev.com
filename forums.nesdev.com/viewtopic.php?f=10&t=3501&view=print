<br />I have question about interrupt vectors.
<br />
<br />Are interrupt vectors always fetched from $FFFA - FFFF ? or are they somehow cached in the CPU during the bootup cycle?

Most mappers freeze $E000+ or $C000+ to the last bank to prevent this, but some have "32 KiB bankswitching" that allows $8000-$FFFF to be switched as a unit. This is useful if a game has multiple independent 32 KiB game engines, as the NMI and IRQ vectors can be pointed to a different handler for each bank, but it needs special care when one subroutine calls another subroutine in a different bank.

Why doesn't the processor just latch it like /NMI? Because multiple devices could be connected to /IRQ and more than one could be asserting at once.</div><br /><br />I recently found out that Nintendo didn't do a very good job of allowing this with the MMC3.  The IRQ output isn't open collector, it's push-pull (could be line driver, I never tested it low).  So it sources at 5v when the MMC3 IRQ isn't firing, and can't be 'pulled down' as it should on an open collector line.  I found the issue when testing my MMC3 on a portable clone, it didn't like the open collector output I gave the MMC3 and required a push-pull.  I tested an original cart and found out the MMC3 IRQ is indeed push-pull.  So if anything besides the MMC3 tried to trigger an IRQ it'd have to fight against the MMC3 holding the line high...

That'd really only be able to come from the EXP connector...<br /><br />EDIT:  It just occured to me why the famicom box doesn't support mmc3 IRQs...  Because they made this 'error' you can't put a bunch of MMC3 carts on the same bus/line because they'd conflict with each other.  So I guess they took the cheap route out and just didn't support the MMC3's IRQs.
