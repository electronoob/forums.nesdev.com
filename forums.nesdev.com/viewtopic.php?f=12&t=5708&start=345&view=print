Even if Game Genie or PAR can work with mask ROM chips without throwing the response time too far out of spec, that doesn't necessarily mean they can work with the RAM in a PowerPak.

<br />I have an SNES Powerpak, and I'm really happy with it so far, but I'm having the issue where Star Ocean won't save (it plays beautifully otherwise).  I have the DeJap translated version 1.0, with the Neviksti patch applied, and I have patched the following locations:
<br />
<br />0081D5: 32-&gt;31h
<br />0081D6: 45-&gt;02h
<br />A081D5: 32-&gt;31h

<br />
<br />But I still can't save!!!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" />  When I go to save the game and say OK, the files still say No Data.  The first three hours of the game were pretty awesome, so I really want to play the rest over the holiday break.
<br />
<br />Can anyone help?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Greetings, fellow SNES PowerPak owners! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />You might be interested to hear that I recently decided to work on a GUI overhaul. I started by using pseudo-hires mode and altering the font and text loading routines, which can now display up to 64 characters per line (useful for long filenames). This was achieved thanks to a programming trick first conceived by ikari_01, maker of the sd2snes. While I opted for a simpler way of doing it, a special second font was still needed as well as reassigning characters to two BG layers in order to compensate for Mode 5's 16x8 tile size limitation.
<br />
<br />The current result, which of course works beautifully on real hardware too, looks like this:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.manuloewe.de/snestuff/powerpak/04SIMBA-hires-WIP2906.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Even though there's still a lot more to do (such as reworking the character-to-BG allocation algorithm in order to avoid flaws like the space in the CF error code), this gives you an idea what the new PowerPak user interface will look like. It might even be fully themeable later on! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Additionally, I'm planning to add more features and improve existing ones like the SPC player by hacking the mapper files, too. This of course will require hours and hours of work because disassembling and rewriting even mere chunks of code is a tedious and time-consuming process. However, as a huge fan of the SNES PowerPak since very early on, I really want to pull off a major software update, no matter how big the challenges. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />@bunnyboy, in case you're reading this, please get in touch if possible.
<br />
<br />Thanks for reading, and long live this awesome flashcart with the spot-on name, the <strong>SNES PowerPak!</strong> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Ramsis

<br />
<br />A few moments ago, I flashed the hacked firmware to my PowerPak in order to get on with testing and debugging. While things tend to look messy at first glance, the process greatly helped me understand how parts of the boot ROM seem to work:
<br />
<br />
<br /><img src="http://manuloewe.de/snestuff/powerpak/04SIMBA-hires-WIP0507_check.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />
<br />Hmm ... no idea yet why the title and version string, and them only, get messed up with a CF card inserted, though. Maybe I'm still using a "forbidden" WRAM location for the second tilemap (i.e., one that gets overwritten somewhere else) ... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /><img src="http://manuloewe.de/snestuff/powerpak/04SIMBA-hires-WIP0507_load.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />The file loading dialog. Apart from how one of Simba's paws was made cursor (:P), notice the two "%s" strings. They appear because unlike the backslash, stuff with a preceding percent sign isn't implemented in the new font routine yet. Anyway, it's a major breakthrough for me to have a better understanding about the way filenames are handled!
<br />
<br />Until next time! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello!  I recently purchased the SNES Powerpak and I really like it, but I'm having a few problems that I can't seem to find much information on.
<br />
<br />1) Super Mario All-Stars.  None of the rom versions I have tried seem to work with the PP.  I can get past the main screen and select a Mario title, but after that the screen goes black.  Sometimes I hear a sound effect or a theme from one of the levels during the blackness.
<br />
<br />2) Zelda: A Link to the Past.  No matter which version I try, the character name entry gets glitchy and when Link awakens in his bed there is a constant beeping sound like when you are low on hearts.  When he gets out of bed, none of the buttons do anything except for the D-Pad and Pause.  He cannon interact with anything.  Weird.
<br />
<br />3) Mega Man X.  I've read that the sequels will not work with PP, but I cannot get the original to load very well.  It's very glitchy and at times Mega Man simply slides across the screen rather than running/walking.
<br />
<br />I'm having issues with several other titles that are not on the incompatible list, but those are the ones I'd like to get working first.
<br />Any suggestions?  I've gotten my NES Powerpak to work without any problems so it's strange that I am having trouble with the SNES counterpart.  I am using an SNES mini, but according to the retrousb site that's a-okay.
<br />
<br />Thank you so much for taking the time to read my post.  In the meantime, I will reformat the memory card again and see what happens.
<br />My thanks,
<br />Error

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@I_Am_Error, I would strongly recommend using another CF card (of a different brand, if possible). From my experience, the SNES PowerPak is especially picky about the type of CF card being used!
<br />
<br />Regarding the new firmware I've announced, there's good news ahead! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.manuloewe.de/snestuff/powerpak/04SIMBA-hires-WIP0807_check.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />
<br />I also finally got the filebrowser working:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.manuloewe.de/snestuff/powerpak/04SIMBA-hires-WIP0807_filebrowser.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />
<br />As you can see, the only critical issue that remains to be fixed is BG1 tilemap clearing/rebuilding. Which is actually not <em>that</em> much of an "issue." <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> 
<br />
<br />On top of that, the routine that interacts with the CF filesystem doesn't seem to load more than ~26 characters of a filename at a time. Gotta fix that, too. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />On a side note, the direction of fast scrolling (with the L and R shoulder buttons) is reversed when loading SRAM files, as many of you might have noticed already. Here's a quick-and-dirty fix for this:
<br /><ul><li>Open SB.MAP from the POWERPAK directory on your CF card with the hex editor of your choice</li><li>Replace the byte at offset $97 [should be $10] with $20</li><li>Replace the byte at offset $D3 [should be $20] with $10</li></ul>That's it! With this mere two-byte-change, the SRAM L/R button behavior should match that of loading ROMs or GameGenie code TXT files (R = down, L = up). <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Until next time!
