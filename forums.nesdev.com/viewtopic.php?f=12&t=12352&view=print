The tool is not yet publically available [there is GITHUB and it is compile-able on OSX, but nobody but me knows how just yet], and currently only the transcriber/debugger/ripper is privately usable.. Having said that, let me know if you have some ideas for this forum in development.<br /><br />If you have further ideas, consider leaving a message on the appropriate forum or tuning in to my blog or youtube channel ^_^ . All of that is accessible from <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://snestracker.club">http://snestracker.club</a><!-- m --> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> The homepage always displays my latest video ^_^

I watched all your youtube videos u linked, nice stuff. For your ideas on interface -- there are sections on SNES Tracker Forums where you can leave these ideas.   I was planning on mostly being inspired from Renoise Tracker. Have you checked out renoise?

Maybe things can be remapped, but I just want to use spacebar to play/pause the song/pattern. SNES GSS still feels like a proof of concept.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />yeah their tracker is not released. The video sounds like he's made other ones about the snes tracker but I haven't searched through all his videos. There's no indication about what percentage it is done, what features the program has (ie importing/editing samples), or if they really intend to release it in a public way. <br /><br />They're involved in those pretty impressive demos that have been floating around, so it seems like they are less interested in making tools for homebrew dev (ie for games proper) if that makes sense.<br /><br />I'm trying to figure out what forums they hang out in and maybe do some lurking.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" />

I don't want to just play .NSF and .SPC files because I need to communicate with the emulated machine in order to play instruments as the user is testing them.

You want to help, but you want to write your own?? What?<br /><br />Anyways, what you're looking for is exactly what I'm doing Tepples. In fact, STD is at a point where you can stop an SPC and then play any of the voices with a MIDI keyboard or PC keyboard, and adjust the ADSR envelopes real-time while you're playing the samples. To do this I'm using <a href="http://www.slack.net/~ant/libs/audio.html" class="postlink">Blargg's APU emulator</a>.<br /><br />Here's a video showing how this comes together: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMZHioeZk9Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMZHioeZk9Y</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The Github repo has full source code, I've modified Blargg's APU emulator to open up its private API so that I can interface with the APU from my application. The source code is dirty
