		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi all. I just bought what I thought was a cheap USB chip programmer off eBay. It's not (I'll be giving it away soon). Anyway, I am looking for suggestions for a good chip programmer that supports a wide range of memory and MCU's. My budget is $100 to $150. Any suggestions? It needs to be 100% USB (or USB + AC/DC Power). I'd like it to support ATtiny and ATmega series MCU's as well.
<br />
<br />Thanks!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I currently use 2 USB programmers, a GQ-2X and a Pickit 3.  They're both USB only - no parallel port or external power required.
<br />
<br />If you think you might possibly use PIC24 or PIC32 chips, the Pickit 3 is a great deal for around $45 prior to shipping.  The in circuit debugging is a huge plus.  I use it with both Windows XP 32-bit and Windows 7 64-bit.
<br />
<br />I keep the GQ-2X for programming EEPROMs and most 8-bit Atmel ATTiny and ATMega chips.  The new model is the GQ-4x and advertises that it supports 32-bit &amp; 64-bit versions of Windows XP, 7 &amp; Vista.  It's around $95 prior to shipping.  Make sure your chips are on the supported list.  The last time I checked it didn't include the ATMega1284p.

<br />
<br />On a side note, I used the ATTiny series for a couple years before moving to the ATMega.  I finally went to the PIC24 then PIC32 because they're usually a bit cheaper and have more peripherals than comparable Atmel UC3 chips.  I used the PIC24FJ64GB002 for the first NES USB keyboard adapter (DIP package) before moving to the PIC32MX series.

<br />I haven't tried it myself. Though I have the original Willem (with LPT port), and it has worked well for me.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />with that small budget finding a USB universal programmer with large device support sounds semi-impossible. you should either increase your budget, or lower your expectations. There is one on Ebay for $150, but it is not a USB programmer;
<br />
<br /><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Xeltek-SuperPro-Z-Universal-Device-Programmer-/250743801144?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item3a617ec538#ht_1282wt_1139" class="postlink">http://cgi.ebay.com/Xeltek-SuperPro-Z-Universal-Device-Programmer-/250743801144?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item3a617ec538#ht_1282wt_1139</a>
<br />
<br />Or i can suggest you checking device manufacturer's website like Xeltek, BPM or Data I/O, manually check if they are supporting your devices. and choose the cheapest one they offer.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The routing is the hard and expensive part. Typically the "pin drivers" are either made from literally hundreds of discrete components or integrated into a pricey custom analog chip (it's unfortunate but they aren't standardized and sold to consumers). Also programmer companies may have to license programming algorithms.
<br />
<br />The driver chips are like a switch array to set a pin to VPP, VCC, GND or input. VPP and VCC levels are typically programmable by DACs and are current-limited. VPP is also typically generated using a charge pump. All of that makes it a bit more complicated than a big microcontroller :P Lots of the programmers these days also use FPGA to implement the algorithms for the maximum programming speed.

<br />
<br />A LOT of time, because you'll have to write the pin poking algorithm for every single part you want to program. There are probably thousands of them.

<br />It just so happens I have more money than time these days, and I wanted to buy a solution.
