It always does things 8 bits at a time, and once it's started 8 silence bits or 8 bits from the buffer, you cannot have any effect until it's finished these 8 bits. Thus, on an NTSC NES the delay between when you start a sample and the first bit of the first sample byte actually starts playing can be up to around 432 cycles (if you've got the DMC at maximum frequency). It is this variable delay that tepples' code is timing.

OK, all done. Is there a sample byte in the buffer now? Yes, OK, I've got the sample, clear the buffer now. Here I go outputting the 8 delta bits over the next 8 timer periods. ... OK, done, is a sample byte in the buffer?
<br />
<br />Then, there's the memory reader that keeps the sample buffer filled. If the sample buffer is empty and there are any remaining bytes to be played, it reads the next byte from RAM and puts it into the sample buffer. If that was the last byte of the sample and IRQ is enabled, it sets the IRQ flag.
<br />
<br />So the only thing feeding the output unit is the timer and the one-byte sample buffer. If you start out with the sample buffer empty and no sample playing, and then start a one-byte sample, you can see how the memory reader will immediately read that byte and put it into the sample buffer, then trigger an IRQ, since there are no more bytes to be READ (it's irrelevant that the sample buffer byte hasn't been played yet; the memory reader just cares about anything more that needs to be read from RAM).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, how the output unit can output silence ? DMC samples either increase or decrease the counter. So does it have a third state that don't affect the counter, or does it just output zero and keep the counter decreasing until it reaches 0 ?
<br />
<br />In fact I guess the last DMC sample should be considered a bug in Nintendo's implementation. Nintendo probably intended samples to be 0, 16, 32, .... bytes long.
<br />So with this system, an IRQ fires as soon as a sample finishes, but there is a bug that makes the sample plays one more byte.
<br />
<br />The CPU is randomly aligned with that 8-stage "output unit" (if it had a more precise name that would probably make things less confusing), which is constantly running at one of those 16 possible speeds, so the only solution to sync with it is to play a sample and see when it finishes. Because it's a terrible waste of CPU time to play a 16-byte sample, even at the fastest speed $f, you play a 0-byte sample, and a IRQ triggers immediately. In the IRQ handler, you play a second 0-byte sample, and because the "output unit" is busy playing the buggy sample, the IRQ only happens when the output unit has done playing this sample. At this IRQ, you KNOW that the "output unit" is on it's reload cycle. Now you can play wathever sample you want for a timed delay, and the third IRQ will come at a predictable time.
<br />
<br />In other words, you have to play 2 dummy samples at the start, and to have 2 dummy IRQs. Right ?
<br />Talk about a major headache.

<br />If I understand correctly, if you set it to 0 through $4011 and use only zeroes for samples it can't go any lower than 0, thus you get a flat line.

"Not playing" is this third state, during which the output unit does not output -2 or +2 values.

<br />It's not strictly necessary to play the first dummy sample with IRQs turned on.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can't get this thing to be steady... the 1 or 2 IRQs that fire when the first sample starts throw all the calculations off, and I get up to 1 scanline of variation...
<br />
<br />EDIT: Maybe I should give up on this. I mean, the technique looks promising and all, and I believe my idea for the generalization of it (so that you can just pass a number of scanlines to a function and get your IRQ at the correct time) is good, but the fact that I'm messing with something I don't quite master (APU) makes this a hit and miss job, and not only I don't like to get the right results by luck without actually understanding the reason but this also takes too much time that could be better spent on my game.
<br />
<br />I got some good things out of this though, such as a function that waits a specified number of scanlines that works for PAL and NTSC dynamically (you just need a flag indicating whether the console is PAL or NTSC). I was gonna use it to wait for the exact scanline of the split after the IRQ before it. If anyone is interested I can share it.

I'm afraid that even if I get rid of the first IRQ there will be a second "ghost" IRQ from time to time. Don't ask me what's up with that double interrupt, but from looking at tepples' code it seems he too noticed it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The priming playback causes an immediate IRQ as the last byte of the wave entered the buffer. The eight-sample period ends during the IRQ handler, causing the buffer to empty into the shift register. The IRQ handler starts another playback, and another IRQ triggers because the buffer again has the last byte of a wave. Look around not_double_irq: in the source code to guess how I detect and compensate for that. (Hint: if the IRQ handler becomes appreciably longer, you need to increase 'lda #6' by the difference in length in eight-cycle units.)
<br />
<br />I am adding comments before the measuring loop to clarify this. I plan to release a new version tomorrow anyway because the NMI handler was using the Y register when it shouldn't have been.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I understand the idea, but there are a lot of things in your code I don't get (lack of comments?), so I tried implementing it in my own way.
<br />
<br />For example, I didn't understand why you count up in order to find out what the delay is. Since the IRQ will fire <strong>before</strong> the location where you actually wanted it to, to me it made more sense to set the counter to what the ideal delay should be and decrease it in the 8-cycle loop until the IRQ fires, so that whatever is left in Y is the number of 8-cycle units you have to wait before performing the raster effects. To me that made more sense than the "adc #176" you have there, that I can't figure out.
<br />
<br />I managed to detect the double IRQs and compensate, but for some reason that reduces my error margin to half a scanline at best. There's probably some other variation I'm not taking into account.
