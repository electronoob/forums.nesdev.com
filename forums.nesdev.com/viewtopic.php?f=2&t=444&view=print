		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been messing around with arranging backgrounds, and each of the methods I've used have proven to be unreliable. I tried the method that was used to design the level for the Junkdemo by charles doty, and that has proven to be GLITCHY. Nintendulator goes phsyco when you load the rom that you made, and virtuaNes doesn't do it correctly, and surprise surprise, nesticle screws it up. It works on Jnes, but nothing else. And the other method is loading a .nam file, which only works on Jnes as well. On all the other emulators, it's like it scrolled down, and stopped at name table 1.5, if you know what I mean. I had to use a crap method to save name table space. I made a Final Fantasy VII Nes screen, and I just took the font they used on the ff2 titlescreen, and arranged it with tepples version of NSA, so it said Final Fantasy, then I put the Burning Earth inbetween Final and Fantasy. There wasn't enough room to have just Final (burning earth) Fantasy, so I had to have a peice of Fantasy written, and then load the other missing letters as sprites. It was bad. I don't even know why I'm talking about that, so I will stop. But does anyone know a reliable way to design levels? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Actually, they probably .incbinned a whole bunch.  You should only use .db and .dw for shorter byte/word additions, because otherwise the whole code page just gets cluttered.  I'm not sure how they stored levels in SMB1, but they most certainly did at least one .incbin with all the level data in it.

<br />I wonder what's so unreliable about this... well, the sprites position being updated during the pause routing, making it's movement visible one pixel at a time by just having a bunch to of NOP being jumped to like 46 million times and returning after that to move one more pixel and do it again seems pretty reliable, haha. That's very unreliable. I don't know about this bg code though. You don't want to see my version of this code running in Nintendulator. It looks like a frickin hurricane. And virtuaNES puts all the tiles in the wrong place. NESticle and Jnes do the Junkdemo right, and Jnes does my code, but not NESticle. I was wondering how the heck you could get a C program to output that hibber jibber you see when you open a .nam file in Notepad? If I knew how to output reliable code for the NES to output on the screen, I would just stop this whole thing and make my own level editor, which I would like to do, but I'm afraid i wouldn't know how to put it in my code. That didn't make much sense. Well, i'm going to go. bye.

<br />
<br />Remember,
<br />
<br />ALWAYS READ FROM $2002 BEFORE WRITING TO $2005/$2006!  READING FROM $2002 RESETS $2005/$2006 TO THE HIGH BYTE, SO YOU CAN RELIABLY WRITE TO THEM!
<br />
<br />NESticle is very forgiving about forgetting to do this, making it a bad emulator to test on, but most emulators are not, for good reason.
<br />
<br />So your code should look like this:
<br />
<br />lda $2002
<br />lda #$20
<br />sta $2006
<br />lda #$00
<br />sta $2006
<br />
<br />----
<br />
<br />With the level thing, you're talking about a disassembly of the program, which doesn't use any .incbins.  Nevertheless, the original assembly code probably does, because it would be quite a job putting in all those .dbs.

<br />
<br />That's not quite true, at least not for me.  Nintendulator is very accurate (except regarding the Frame IRQs), but it is slow as a result.  It should only be used for hacking.  FCEU should be used for general gaming.

<br />
<br />It will, because the value of $2002 at that point is unimportant to your program.  The reason you need to read from $2002 is to reset $2006; if you don't, then $2006 will be, to use your term, unreliable.  If, after you write to $2006, you want to do it again, then you need to read from $2002 again (except in certain special cases).
<br />
<br />Look through the source code of any Nintendo game: they will always have some sort of read from $2002 before writing to $2005/$2006.

Well, it was a little more reliable, but I think I would be better off making my own level editor. That's going to take a while. i think I will try and make a level editor that writes to all name tables instead of just one. And maybe I'll have a scanline sort of thing where when you cross over it, it rewrites the data for the name tables that are offscreen. Do you know what I mean? like this:<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />l nt1____l__nt0__l_nt1__ l<br />lllllllllllllllllllllllll xlllllllllllllllllllllllllll<br />---------------------------------<br />l_nt3___l__nt2__ l__nt3__l<br />llllllllllllllllllllllllllxlllllllllllllllllllllllllll<br />---------------------------------<br /><br />where the x is the scan line thing, and when you cross over it, it resets the data in nt1 and nt3, and if you cross over it the other way, it will reset the data in nt1 and nt3 again, for making large levels. Do you think this is possible? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I need to study C a little more and I need to have it put out hibber jibber that the NES can read well. That's gonna be really hard.</div>

<br />It was a little more reliable?  Well, did it load or not?
