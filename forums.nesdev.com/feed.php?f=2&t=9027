NES output has a very digital like quality to it with very discrete and large color phase changes.  Should be possible to reference on a NTSC vectorscope to get the exact NTSC colors, but then you have multiple standards for converting NTSC to RGB so which one then?<br /><br />NES doesn't have a palette; the pixel color is just a lookup into a phase selection for a native NTSC output.<br /><br />At first I freaked out about not having RGB on NES for my Sony PVM monitor like I do for everything else, but its actually a very good composite signal vs other systems.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5673">exdeath</a> — Wed Oct 03, 2012 1:22 pm</p><hr />

I was the one who added those palette pseudo-ROMs to MAME some time ago, and yes, I copied them from Nintendulator because I couldn't find Kevtris's original data anywhere on the web at the time. I had no idea the Nintendulator PC10 palette had been hacked to add the extra greys, and I seem to have unwittingly propagated a great deal of confusion as a result. Apologies all around.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3737">AWJ</a> — Wed Oct 03, 2012 3:04 am</p><hr />

They did apparently try to make a palette that looks like a NES, but they didn't do it very well.<br />There aren't any known dumps for the RGB PPUs used in Sharp Titler and Sharp C1, there is some (small) chance that they have a different and maybe more accurate palette in there.<br /><br />I've compared kevin's dumps for the standard palette and the 4 special palettes with the MAME ones: They are exactly same, except that MAME is having those three unreal extra-grays in there.<br /><br />And the &quot;early&quot; standard palette in RC2C03B. The only difference to the &quot;normal&quot; standard is that Green.Bit1 is missing in each Fourth color (color 1,5,9). Looks more like a BUG as than a cosmetic change. No idea if it's a real hardware bug that exists in all RC2C03B chips, or if it's coming from a damaged RC2C03B chip, or if it's just a corrupt palette dump.<br />If it's a real hardware bug, then there should be some visible difference when running a palette-test-screen program on RC2C03B compared to running on RC2C03C/RP2C03B/RP2C03C/RC2C05-0x.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Cool, I'm glad Q found the rest of the palettes.<br /></div><br />Me too.

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Might the RC and RP chips be the same thing from different fabs?<br /></div><br />The &quot;R&quot; might be for Ricoh (as in Ricoh's RP5H01 PROM; used in Playchoice and NSS cartridges). Don't know what &quot;C&quot; and &quot;P&quot; are for. But no, they aren't the same, RC2C03B and RP2C03B have different colors in them). EDIT: &quot;C&quot; and &quot;P&quot; seem to mean Ceramic and Plastic package.

Best by multiplying the 3bit value by 9248h (=1001001001001001b), then right-shifting the result until reaching the desired number of color bits. The VS and PC10 palettes aren't very close to the NES palette. They are useful for reproducing quirks in VS/PC10 games, but I would avoid using them for real NES games.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Are the RGB palettes from Animal Crossing GCN and the Wii Virtual Console dumped?<br /></div><br />What are that? Official NES emulators from Nintendo? Might be interesting to see that palettes. I wouldn't recommend to use that palettes for anything though.

Nice ppu list. Thanks! I didn't knew about the RP2C03C and RC2C05-99 chips. Yes, Kevin's &quot;G&quot; might have been a mistyped or misread &quot;C&quot;. Maybe his &quot;-05&quot; actually meant &quot;-99&quot;. But I am not sure if it's possible to do SUCH a typo <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> Maybe if he was having the &quot;Fifth RC2C05&quot; chip in mind.<br /><br />Are you sure Duck Hunt is using RC2C03C and RP2C03B? This page <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.johnsarcade.com/nintendo_vs_ppu_info.php">http://www.johnsarcade.com/nintendo_vs_ppu_info.php</a><!-- m --> page lists RC2C03B instead of RP2C03B.<br /><br />RP2C03B would be the Playchoice PPU (but maybe it was also used in VS games).<br />RP2C03C appears to be used in Sharp C1 TV Sets (and maybe used elsewhere, too).<br /><br />Guess there is no known way to decipher those &quot;4A4 28&quot; date codes, or is there some formula?<br /><br />Meanwhile, Quietust has found some of Kevin's dumps, and uploaded them here <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.qmtpro.com/~nes/misc/kevtris_palettes.zip">http://www.qmtpro.com/~nes/misc/kevtris_palettes.zip</a><!-- m --> the package contains 11 color dumps, and for some reason, only 10 &quot;monochrome&quot; dumps.<br />The three color+mono sets beginning with a &quot;2&quot; in the filenames are duplicates (they have been apparently renamed to names beginning with &quot;C2&quot; and &quot;P2&quot; to separate between &quot;RC2xxx&quot; and &quot;RP2xxx&quot; chip names). Aside from the changed filenames, some of them also contain slightly different 8:8:8 bit RGB values - but the actual 3:3:3 bit values are really exact dupes.<br />So, in total, the .zip contains dumps for 7-and-a-half-PPU (the &quot;half&quot; one only as &quot;color&quot; dump).<br /><br />The .pal files are ascii text files with 512 lines per file, which is making it not too comfortable to read them. I've made a small tool that squeezes the data into 4 lines, with 16 colors per line, and with the emphasis stuff removed.<br />Before removing emphasis, the tool has verified that the emphasis area contained expected values (=the normal colors, with emphased R:G:B components changed to &quot;7&quot;) (the emphasis verification passed for all 11 color dumps and all 10 mono dumps, so the emphases is apparently working the same way in all PPUs, and there's no valuable info lost when removing that part of the dumps).<br />Anyways - here are the .PAL files in squeezed form:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">C2C03B.PAL (=RC2C03B, early &quot;standard&quot;

I've contacted Quietust (nintendulator author), here's his reply about the extra grays: <em>I added them for &quot;compatibility&quot; reasons - namely, so you could use the PC10 palette with non-PC10 games without some grays becoming black (and messing up the game's graphics).</em><br />So, the extra grays are a myth, nothing to do with real hardware. Dunno why MAME has them, too. But looks as if they adopted the palette from the nintendulator source code.<br /><br />Also asked Quietust about Kevin's 13 rgb palette dumps (I thought somebody mentioned he got those dumps from him), but he couldn't help there.<br /><br />joat, what collection of VS PPUs do you have? (just the chip-names). According to the &quot;NES 2.0&quot; format there are 13 VS ppus. But the &quot;RP2C03B&quot; is almost certainly used only in PC10 (and famicom titler and special tv sets maybe) but not in VS system. And of the remaining 12 VS ppus - I have my doubts that the &quot;RP2C03G&quot; and &quot;RC2C05-05&quot; do really exist. There are a bunch emulators &quot;supporting&quot; them (presumably based on the &quot;NES 2.0&quot; format specs), but other than that there aren't any webpages ever mentioning those PPUs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5211">nocash</a> — Sun Sep 02, 2012 8:17 am</p><hr />

Some VS Unisystem games have custom PPUs with custom palettes, but for the RGB PPUs that are out there (PC-10, Sharp C1, Titler) I'd bet 1000 yen that they all have the same palette and quirks as in my picture.   And yes, colour ranges $xD are all black, causing some games to show differences.  See here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://playoffline.wordpress.com/mod/rgbppu/">http://playoffline.wordpress.com/mod/rgbppu/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The bigger problem is that games that use colour emphasis to darken the screen make the screen completely white on an RGB PPU.

When I get a chance I'll go thru my backups to see if he sent me palettes for them or any other information.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Michael<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6">joat</a> — Thu Aug 30, 2012 10:34 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />You would think, but the RGB PPU (Playchoice one) likely was produced after the original composite one. They also are a bit different in some areas, so a few Famicom and NES games actually will display worse on an RGB PPU: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.chrismcovell.com/images/Fami_Comp_RGB_Difference.jpg">http://www.chrismcovell.com/images/Fami ... erence.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /></div><br /><br />That's a nice interesting picture! But why are the two color &quot;D&quot; gray-scales (at the bottom) of the RGB palette missing? Is that correct?<br />Other info that I've found about the RGB palette suggests that color &quot;D&quot; <strong>does</strong> have <em>three</em> gray-scales (one more gray-level than the NES does have).<br /><br />Oh, and about the different RGB palettes in general: I've tried to figure out what they are in this NESemdev thread: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=93681#p93681">viewtopic.php?p=93681#p93681</a><!-- l --> - I ended up with a theory what they might be, but I wasn't able to confirm if it's correct. Here's a summary of what I've found out and what's still unclear:<br /><br />According to Kevin, there are 13 different RGB PPUs. But I couldn't find any useful info on the  &quot;RP2C03G&quot; and &quot;RC2C05-05&quot; chips (what games/consoles are using them, do they exist at all?)<br /><br />That bit-for-bit palette dumps for ALL 13 RGB PPUs are very ominous, too. Did anybody ever saw those 13 dumps? According to MAME, there are only 5 different palettes: 4 special palettes for 4 special PPUs, and 1 standard palette for the other 9 PPUs. I am not too sure if that is corrent. Kevin is somehow suggesting that there might be different variants of the standard palette.<br /><br />For the ID bits in the &quot;RC2C05-01..05&quot; series, I've figured out IDs for three chips. For the other two chips it's still unknown what ID values they have (if any).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5211">nocash</a> — Thu Aug 30, 2012 11:41 am</p><hr />
