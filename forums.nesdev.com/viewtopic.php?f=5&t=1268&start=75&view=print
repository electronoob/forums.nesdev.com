<br />
<br />Several of the games seem to have worth-while music, so I don't mind a slight bit of work on a driver I understand well. The majority of the work goes into rewriting 1 particular banking routine, and relocating the FF30 table info. It's all the newer games that have coding too complex for me to grasp easily with the current tools. Perfect Dark loads it's music driver into a D000 bank, at which point, it proceeds to bank and unbank the RAM from code, and the D000 code seems to bank and unbank the ROM. There's also the matter of how differently each GBS emulator works, where even an overall successful rip for one will fail in another.
<br />
<br />Also, I've messed with my GBS to GB maker enough that it actually works again, with the new coding. I don't see how I kept believing it worked when it had a few errors here and there. Must have had something to do with my keeping the original known-working version in my GBS folder.

<br />
<br />I have "Donkey Kong (JU) (V1.0) [S][!]"
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, this is one of my older rips, and I lost my notes on it, so the only way I can fix it is if I were to re-rip the gbs, which I might do in the future.
<br />
<br />I just looked at the game again, and there definately was no music playing during the credits. Perhaps you're using a different version of the game than I am?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />People shouldn't have to ask before they make a copy of something like an NSF or GBS. Mirroring is what saves files from being junked when a server dies, or the site stops operating. Maybe with broken rips, it would be a good idea to ask, but with rips that are believed to be working, it shouldn't be an issue. Rippers who choose to stick around know the score on the potential that their name will be lost when their work moves around. Most people who would want to steal credit are too dense to actually pull it off.
<br />
<br />I managed to do that Toy Story rip. It required that I set BGB's mode to regular Gameboy, because the music wouldn't play otherwise. It makes sense that the DK rip could be missing music in that case, but having skimmed through the code, I think some init value needs to exist, or some tracks need to be played consecutively, or some other mind-numbingly obscure nonsense.

Read other sources of information or do some tests yourself. If they don't work, you can either deem it a failure, or find out why it doesn't work. If your only avenue of interest is to ask other people to do things for you, then you're not contributing anything but a headache to respond to. You need to study, comprehend, and possibly even practice in some of the fields you've been posting about. The reply you just posted could have been avoided just by attempting to rename the file to .SPC, and trying to play it. The fact that it wouldn't have worked would have immediately answered your question for you.
