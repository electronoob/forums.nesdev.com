Getting the protagonist to survive would beat the game, but the challenge would be getting as many as possible to survive. They have different skills/be differently effective using them. That way you need to get the right person to the right place in the right time, so it's also a bit like a slow going game of lemmings.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well that's mainly speaking of using the Alien(s) IP. It'd be quite fun to try to copy the visual style of the movie and make it a game. The architetcure, dominant colours, the hazy, fedback feed on their monitors, etc. The synopsis for the design in itself might be worth revisiting sometime perhaps and try to make better. <br /><br />Maybe a point and click adventure or limited sandbox featuring <a href="https://www.moomin.com/en/" class="postlink">Moomin</a>, then. It's such a lush, dynamic world and i don't think moomin fans have ever been able to explore it themselves in that way. When i read the Moomin books and graphic novels as a kid, all i wanted was to go there myself and invent my own adventure.

At the time I thought it was pretty cool to be working on something based on one of my favourite movies. It helped keep me motivated on the project.<br /><br />I'm mostly pretty cynical about IP licensing and video games, but there's much stuff that I'd still be pretty excited to work on. In particular I really want to make an Aeon Flux game, especially one that included some adaptation of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfc-p1x8aC0" class="postlink"><em>Tide</em> short</a>. We only ever got <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86on_Flux_(video_game)" class="postlink">Aeon Flux: The Movie: The Game</a> for PS2, which was somewhat forgettable. In a bit of a weird reversal Peter Chung (Aeon Flux's director) ended up adapting a video game into an animated series with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revisioned:_Tomb_Raider" class="postlink">Re\Visioned: Tomb Raider</a>, also with Drew Neumann doing music.
