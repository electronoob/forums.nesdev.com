		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There's only 2kb of internal ram, which is $800 bytes. This is because, at the time, 2kb was cheaper than 4kb or 8kb, and for a new game console, that's important.
<br />
<br />The range 0000-1FFF spans 8kb, and is mapped to internal ram, but the NES only has a 2kb ram chip in it. To specify a number between 0000-1FFF, you need 13 bits. However, the 2kb ram chip only takes in 11 bit adresses. So to keep things simple, the NES only connects 11 of its address bits to the ram chip.
<br />
<br />This means that the bits higher than the 11th bit are ignored by the ram, so the byte at address $0000 also appears at $0800, $1000, and $1800, since the only difference between those addresses is the state of the 12th and 13th bits, which the ram chip doesn't look at.

<br />The gameboy actually had a full 8kb of internal ram. As a result, it was easier to make complex games with large maps and lots of dynamic objects. One potential drawback is that programmers no longer needed to be clever and efficient with their ram utilization. A benefit obviously would be that the cartridges would be cheaper, since they would rarely need to contain extra ram, unless you want battery-backed sram.
<br />
<br />However, the gameboy came out 4 years after the NES, so Nintendo could put more ram in the units and still have them be affordable, thanks to Moore's law.

<br />
<br />That doesn't really matter though...in fact if you think about it it'd be a shame to NOT use that extra ram. I don't see how being less efficient is bad if it truly doesn't matter and makes your life easier (allowing you to concentrate on other aspects of the programming)
