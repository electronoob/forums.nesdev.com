Result would be flickery but since the stock LCD is so slow all stuff blends together.

But, if you were somehow able to feed the NES's video signal into something that manually inserts its own interlacing v-sync signal, I'll bet that'll make the colors change slightly, even if it's displaying the same picture.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Going over same area on the phosphor does not really make it brighter in non-interlaced scan. Maximum intensity remains the same. By The time the next field comes the phosphors are dark. It takes less than quarter of the screen for phosphors to dim down completely. It is all down to presistance of vision.<br />The light curve the phosphors exhibit is completely logarithmic. Very short peak and a rapid decrease in brightness. This is the reason the image is not perceived as flickery when the brightness is turned down on a CRT, you stay more in the gradual part of the slope.

Hence, more (twice?) burn-in per second as an interlaced static image, and only of every other scanline, leading to irregular aging.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">TmEE wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Going over same area on the phosphor does not really make it brighter in non-interlaced scan.</div><br />Please explain this picture (2x_bright.nes):<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

	</div><br />In it, the NES is illuminating every other line. On odd frames, every other 8-pixel column is shifted down one pixel. So in effect, you get a magnified comparison between progressive and interlace side-by-side. The appearance is of the stable lines being twice the brightness as the ones illuminated only once every other frame. At a distance, the whole screen looks like a solid shade, with no vertical columns visible. Since on average only half as many lines are composing every other column, they must be twice as bright or else the column wouldn't appear the same shade as the interlaced one.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; Even frames&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Odd frames<br />1 **************** ********<br />2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ********<br />3 **************** ********<br />4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ********<br />Appearance<br />1 ********--------<br />2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--------<br />3 ********--------<br />4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--------</div>

Only other TV I have here is an LG 100Hz wonder that deinterlaces any input... digitally... with rather blurry result and input lag, making games hard to play.<br />EDIT: I tried it in 50Hz, and I see the effect at near normal brightness too. I still had to lower it a bit. It is said the TVs in EU have longer glow on the phosphors, and it is probably what is happening over here, that diminishes the effect (and which is why I said that it should not really make the image brighter...).
