Yeah, I'd heard the C compiler is mostly geared for 6502.<br /><br />x816 should work with DOSBox because I've definitely used it (it took a long time assemble the NSF player, which was funny to watch).  Maybe it uses a DOS 32-bit extender .exe that wasn't in your path when you ran it?  I guess it would've said so, though.<br /><br />ASM6 sorta reminds me of the x816 (for 6502) in some ways, I guess because it's simple and effective.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Oct 10, 2010 3:27 pm</p><hr />

Verbose labels obscure the relevant information of what the code is doing. More noise, less signal = less readability = most cost to maintain. Being able to use local @symbols and +/- unnamed labels is what the assembler is for, to allow more concise expression of things, to do the tedious work so you don't have to (in this case, your eyes having to wade through increased noise).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Fri Oct 08, 2010 12:28 pm</p><hr />

I very rarely use more than one + or -. That's where a named label becomes useful. But a single - is very common for short loops. I think if you've never used them you might <em>imagine</em> they would be hard to read, but that's because you're imagining complex situations where they wouldn't be the best solution. For a typical file of mine that's about 290 source lines, there were 29 total labels, 13 unnamed, with all but one used for a 2-5 instruction loop. Thus, there is no difficulty in following them. It's clear that it's a loop, and a comment describes its purpose better than a label could. By reserving labels for situations that aren't loops or simple branches over a few instructions (i.e. part of an if construct), the very fact that something has a label communicates information about its use. If named labels were used for everything, this extra expressiveness would be lost as well.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Thu Oct 07, 2010 8:11 pm</p><hr />

Regarding unnamed labels:<br /><br />I may be biased since I never used them but to me it feel more like a mess than anything. For small code with maybe one "-" or maximum two "--" it could be acceptable but the more you add, the mode it becomes messy.  I think locals labels are the way to go (with CC65) since you can re-use their name and it can make the code clearer if used properly.<br /><br />If you read the comments from the author of CC65, this is what he said exactly, word for word:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Unnamed labels may be accessed by using the colon plus several minus or plus characters as a label designator. Using the '-' characters will create a back reference &#40;use the n'th label backwards&#41;, using '+' will create a forward reference &#40;use the n'th label in forward direction&#41;. An example will help to understand this:<br /><br />            :       lda     &#40;ptr1&#41;,y        ; #1<br />                    cmp     &#40;ptr2&#41;,y<br />                    bne     :+              ; -&gt; #2<br />                    tax<br />                    beq     :+++            ; -&gt; #4<br />                    iny<br />                    bne     :-              ; -&gt; #1<br />                    inc     ptr1+1<br />                    inc     ptr2+1<br />                    bne     :-              ; -&gt; #1<br /><br />            :       bcs     :+              ; #2 -&gt; #3<br />                    ldx     #$FF<br />                    rts<br /><br />            :       ldx     #$01            ; #3<br />            :       rts                     ; #4<br /><br />As you can see from the example, unnamed labels will make even short sections of code hard to understand, because you have to count labels to find branch targets &#40;this is the reason why I for my part do prefer the &quot;cheap&quot; local labels&#41;.

If I want 512 bytes of ROM in a given 4 KiB CHR bank reserved for data, I make that bank's tile sheet 128x112 pixels instead of 128x128.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />And surprisingly, you don't mention the biggest issue I have with WLA currently : NO SUPORT OF RELOCATABLE CODE.

This allows labels such as "charloop" or "xloop" to be reused from subroutine to subroutine, allowing the labels themselves to reinforce the meaning of the code comments. And before that, back when I was working on <a href="http://www.pineight.com/lj65/" class="postlink">a project that I started in x816 and finished in ca65</a>, I used <a href="http://www.cc65.org/doc/ca65-6.html#ss6.4" class="postlink">@ labels</a>, which are valid only between normal labels.

Oh well, I guess we can get into discussing these unnamed labels. ca65's are workable, but no other assemblers use the convention, whereas the + and - convention is shared by many assemblers. The + and - convention also has the benefit of being fairly clear even without explanation, and somewhat consistent. There's a label named -, followed by a branch to -. Or a label named ++ and a branch before it to ++. Then you see multiple labels of the same name, and the first time you figure out which branch goes to which merely by proximity, and then see the way the + and - dictate direction.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Thu Oct 07, 2010 5:41 pm</p><hr />

The most annoying bit about :+ and :- is that it confuses the hell out of emacs' assembly autoindent. Well, aside from the fact that they were broken in a few versions. Unfortunately, automatically rewriting the file to go from +/- to : and :+/:- isn't entirely trivial, since cases like <br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">- cmp<br />  beq +<br />  bne ++<br />+bit<br />  bvc -<br />+rts<br /></div><br /><br />get a bit tricky to convert. You can't get away with converting every - or + in the first column to a :, and prepending a : to +'s and -'s after branches, because the ca65 version of that would be<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">: cmp<br />  beq :+<br />  bne :++<br />:bit<br />  bvc :--<br />:rts<br /></div><br /><br />A 2-pass approach could probably do it though. Alternatively, someone could hack in support, though I recall the sourcebase for it being a bit messy.<br /><br />The heavyweight bit can be mitigated somewhat with a decent premade makefile and linker script.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8">ReaperSMS</a> — Thu Oct 07, 2010 5:05 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, the only notable complaint I've had with CA65/CC65 is the anonymous label syntax.  I do remember there being a discussion about on the CC65 email list many years ago, not sure what the conclusion was, but maybe there's some insight there if it's available for searching.<br /><br />They look really ugly, so I tend do just make up garbage names (if it's not a very short branch), which is all anonymous labels are supposed to be good for anyways.  I often use local labels (preceded with @), so I can often use the same generic yet more descriptive names anyways.<br /><br />I used DASM before, I left it then because it didn't have incbin (it does now though), it seemed good but I was a newb at the time and wasn't using macros or any kind of fancy stuff yet.  If it's got good macro support (I don't remember), it should be just fine.<br /><br />x816 seemed like a pretty good assembler, I can't use anymore though without using DOSBox.  I mostly used it for my SNES 2A03 emulator, so it has to be assembled in DOSBox if I rebuild it anymore, heheh.  Nerdtracker 2 used it originally (later I changed Bananmos' old code to assemble in CA65)<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I think CC65 fixed all the issues I mentioned (confirmation would be fine).<br /></div><br /><br />It's kind of funny, for relocatable code (that you want to move yourself) you actually use the .ORG command.  And the end of it you use .reloc.  So it's the rest of the stuff that's truly relocatable as far as the linker is concerned, heheh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Oct 07, 2010 5:02 pm</p><hr />
