		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I figured that some video games have music tunes which are ridiculously simple / weird, that normally would sound stupid for having only 1 voice and/or repeating after a very short while, but that for an obscure reason sounds cool.
<br />
<br />Some examples I can think of :
<br />Of course <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0fZl5OjOi0&amp;feature=related" class="postlink">this song</a> from SMB it only has ONE voice (played on 2 channels) and repeats after 12 secs but it does sound pretty good
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWJEpr8U_aY&amp;feature=related" class="postlink">This song</a> from Wario Land is really mysterious
<br />
<br />Another one, slightly more advanced but still fairly simple that I REALLY like is the Gun Smoke menu music. I didn't find it on Youtube but you just have to play Gun Smoke and press select. It's dumb and repeats quickly, yet it sets an AWESOME mod for such a simple song.
<br />
<br />Anyone have other example of incredibly simple songs that sounds cool ? And please don't mention that MM2 get weapon songs, yes i know everyone like it but I don't it get on my nerves.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />One that comes to mind is Genghis Khan.  This game is set in the 13th century and the setting is pretty much the entire northern hemisphere (minus North America).
<br />
<br />The music for Japan, track 4.  It sounds extremely unrelenting, but I think it's cool.  If you use Japan when learning to play this game, you may hear this song for hours on end.
<br />
<br />track 8 is really weird.  It has some tempo changes that are really unsettling, I don't know if it sounds cool but it is unique.

I knew it was going to be mentioned but like the MM2 victory song it gets on my nerves, altough I still like it in a way. I think they included it on Battletoads to make the game even harder as you couldn't pause and take a rest without hearing this annoying drumbeat.
<br />Anways I can't belive someone posted a 5min version of it on youtube.
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Fun fact: The Battletoads pause theme varies in speed depending on which level you pause in.</div><br />I think this is because the status bar is lower in levels 6 and 12 because they needed crazy pattern table updates.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Bomberman</div><br />I agree fully.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />How can it NOT get on your nerves?

<br />Also on <a href="http://www.dutycyclegenerator.com/" class="postlink">Neil Baldwin's blog</a> he features the music he made for Lethal Weapon, which had to preserve one of the square channels for sound effects.  It sounds pretty good for working under even more restrictions than usual.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I always get Die Hard and Lethal Weapon mixed up.  Also Spy Hard and Naked Gun...

<br />I have to agree it's a great song, but it's not what I would call an "extremely simple song", the loop is long and it uses all channels. But it'd definitely weird and interesting !

<br />
<br />Yeah, I liked Rygar's music a lot.  Definitely check out Conflict by Vic Tokai, Rygar is uncredited AFAIK but I'm pretty sure it's the same composer.  While it mostly uses 2 channels, the melodies are fairly complex.
