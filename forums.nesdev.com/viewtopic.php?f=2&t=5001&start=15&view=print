<br />I received a (pirate, obviously) Arumana No Kiseki cart the other day. I haven't traced out the cart board yet, but it has CHR RAM, WRAM, and mapper hardware is a PAL16L8, two 74LS670, 74LS90 and 4020 chips. Title screen text has been changed to read "(c)  KISS  1989". It should be fairly simple to dump that in due course.

<br />Cool.  I remember playing that game as a kid. The rental video store had it.  I didn't know at the time that it was a pirate cart.  As if it was written kiss 1989, hmm... good question.  
<br />
<br />I remember the music is different from the FDS version since the real game uses a lot the extra channel.  I want to hear that version again.  If someone ever dump it someday, I want the nsf <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  I want to hear it again. It will bring back memories.
<br />
<br />I still want to buy the original thought.  Game I like, I always buy them. But the problem is those #$"% floppy disk fail so easily.. The current street price in Akihabara is easily 30$/40$ so paying that much for a game that will fail eventually seems wrong.  Getting the pirate cart will have more chance of surviving longer than the original  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  But today, it must be quite hard to find it.  
<br />
<br />If you find an extra one, which I think would be quite unlikely, let me know <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />Keep the following in mind however:
<br />
<br />The original Doki Doki Panic has a different story, and consequently different gameplay: You must beat the entire game four times, once with each character in order to reach the ending screen, which is different than the SMB2-USA ending. 
<br />
<br />If you really want to make a DP ROM, I suggest using the FDS image as a source and doing a ROM conversion of the code, assuming you are up to the task.
<br />
<br />If all you want is the DDP patched ROM for SMB2-USA, let me know. I have both that and the FDS image of the real game.

<br />I know these differences, I also already found that rom in a torrent.

<br />I do not need help for finding this DDP rom anymore, Thanks though!

<br />BTW: Links containing ROM links are not allowed here. Can some Moderator or Admin take care of that please?
