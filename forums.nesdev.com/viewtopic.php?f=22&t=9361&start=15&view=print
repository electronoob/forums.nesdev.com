(Also there doesn't seem to be any need at all to debounce.)

You can look at the codes to see how it works. If you think it is good or no good then you can tell me your opinion, but you should look at it first before deciding if it is good or no good.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was only trying the start button press thing to see how random it actually was; not a commentary on your game. (This is also why I put it in its own thread.)<br /><br />Initial contents of ram and microphone are not good for randomness, especially because we mostly have to use emulators (very few of us have a keyboard and a famicom). I don't think there's any need for this.<br /><br />tepples was suggesting you need enough bits of entropy to be able to jump to any of your phrases from the start. Your time spent waiting for space is good, I think, but only because you're not limiting it to one per NMI. In a short loop like that it's easy to rack up high numbers for your random seed. Since you go to the same wait-for-space routine after every round, that should be quite sufficient to keep the phrases from repeating in the same order, etc. There's really no need to do anything to the RNG anywhere else, like your microphone test.

What I use is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4" class="postlink">RC4</a> without a key (&quot;S&quot; is initialized to the identity permutation only), and the &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; are not initialized to zero or anything else (it just uses what happens to be in RAM, usually zero if an emulator is used, though), and the microphone sometimes causes it to add 2 to &quot;i&quot; instead of just 1, and the &quot;K&quot; output is ignored except when selecting the phrase to use at random.
