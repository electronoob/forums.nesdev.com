Your analysis tool could then be written completely separate from the emulator and use those logs as input.

<br />You basically fill in all the blanks with your own assumptions, then ask why they paint the developers as doing silly things. Examine your assumptions if the conclusion they lead to is absurd.
<br />
<br />So, show us the code, then ask questions. "Why is it written like this instead of some other way? All I can imagine is that they were trying to save a few bytes, but they don't even seem to use the bytes they saved, so it doesn't  make sense." See how that doesn't bring lots of derogatory remarks into the picture, and sets the stage for actually coming up with a good explanation for the code being the way it is?
<br />
<br />I can't help but getting the feeling that you have decided on the conclusion in advance, and simply want to validate it, rather than actually understand the purpose and things that lead to said code being the way it is. I don't know about others, but I don't appreciate reading posts here that just put down developers (this isn't the only place you've done so, either). And I don't care if it's someone else you're putting down; I don't like to be in the presence of one-sided attacks like the above.

<br />
<br />-with optimised code involving heavy macro use and loop unrolling, it'd be code size that holds the programmer back if they're trying to fit it on a small ROM.
<br />-producing the most efficient loops and such the first time around isn't a reasonable expectation for complicated code.  If the optimal code is not the easiest to debug then a commerical developer wouldn't be expected to do it.  Not if they have to produce and debug many pages of code every day.  No one is going to write near perfect code in the first attempt either.  That, and having limited time to review previously written code would probably account for mediocre code in plenty of SNES games.
<br />
<br />The drawstatusbar in SMW is a poor example since it only runs once a frame and the speed difference / size difference is tiny.  The same sort of loop is used several times throughout the game and it's mainly once-a-frame stuff.  It adds up to over 200 bytes which isn't much, but if many routines are kept compact then the savings will add up fast.  Definitely more than '5 bytes', and that 200+ byte figure is just for a the few times the DMA loop thing got used.  Original SMW isn't pressured for vblank time either, so using slower but more compact code was not a big deal.

<br />
<br />A strategy I use, is during v-blank I usually have the accumulator in 8-bit mode, and index in 16-bit mode.  When I need to write to a single register I use the accumulator.  If I need to write to 2 back to back registers like $2116 &amp; $2117, I use X or Y.  That saves memory, development time and speed all at the same time.

<br />Then not enough attention will be put toward making the game fun. Sure, optimization can be job 1 in a port, where you've already refined the design of the game itself. But when one is designing and implementing a game from whole cloth, design and balance compete with code efficiency. See the lead of <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Limitations" class="postlink">a wiki article about NES limitations</a>.

<br />Yeah, same I use for all my SNES code except short sections where a 16-bit A or 8-bit X/Y significantly speeds things up or reduces tedium. I try to avoid switching size because it's so likely to cause mismatches with routines and subtle bugs. I could have every routine set the register size on entry and restore on exit, but that'd be tedious and inefficient. I can't really imagine any other way, given how many 8-bit quantities you have to deal with regularly (partly because the hardware registers so often deal in 8-bit quantities).
