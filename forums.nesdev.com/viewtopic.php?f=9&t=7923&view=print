		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />hi everybody 
<br />i'll be talking about somthin' happened 5 years ago when the 1st port of controller damaged.
<br />2 weeks before that , the port was slightly desoldered(disentangled) from the board unintentionally due to the controller  wrongly disconnecting , so i soldered it by using iron welding machine and it had worked well.2 weeks then , this port which is (1) didn't respond as the port 2 has worked well till now.
<br />so what's the reason?i guess soldering has affected it.and what's the solution?

<br /><span style="color: red"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">the marked area on the right is the port that doesn't work.</span><br /></span>
<br />i have two other consoles that don't work?can i replace the boards including the ports with each other?is there a hardware chip or piece that i have to change?and can i replace this piece by extracting it from another console?
<br />all those questions have come on my mind for a long time till i found this forum whose members are experienced and helpful.
<br />waiting 4 ur reply

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's probably gonna be an easy fix imo. I'll still wait for the clearer picture but sound like it can be fixed by soldering jumper wire from the pin to the trace where pin is supposed to be connected. That's assuming the board connection were lifted and separated from the rest of the trace around the pin of the connector which is common on that kind of cheap board specially on right angled plug because of the stress caused by insertions and tugging. I usually fix that kind of thing by scratching off the PCB trace insulation around the pin, exposing the copper and then creating a solder bridge between the pin connection and the trace where that connection is going. But I think jumper wire would be a better solution in the long run.

<br />
<br />What he's saying, just more eloquently than me: all of the photos are horribly blurry.  It's literally impossible to tell what's what (what trace goes where, your soldering work, etc.), and the text you added isn't readable either (if you're going to use JPEG, please ensure compression is at a bare minimum for quality reasons, otherwise use PNG).

I hope that's a translation error, and you didn't really use a welding tool to solder electronics.  This board looks badly damaged - it's likely fixable, but do not use the same tool that caused all of that damage!

<br />welder?no i used iron welding and welding wire.

<br />i said at first that the port was separated or disentangled from the board or the trace , so i soldered it and it worked well for awhile and 2 weeks then , it stopped working.i don't know till now what happened and why it stopped working.
<br />u asked 4 clearer images.can the previous image help u to know what's wrong?
<br />is there a hardware piece that has to be changed?i'm ready to take this piece from another console to replace it.

<br />
<br />I presume the solder wire you used is rosin-core or whatever type intended for electronics.  Solder for plumbing or other uses would be harmful to the board.
