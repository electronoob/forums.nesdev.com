<br />So far I have all the small stuff figured out (power, ground, clock, a/v, whether or not it is a NOAC, etc...), but I'm not sure how to go about mapping the glob-top rom. I know it's been done for the GOAC (although that was a glob-top pcb soldered to the board), so I'm sure it's plausible, just not sure how hard it'd be. 
<br />It's the smallest NOAC board I've seen so far at 1.5"x1.5"

Not too solid, but it's pointing in that direction <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />Yeah I have one of these...   it is indeed an NES on a chip as far as I can tell, with a multicart on a chip attached.  
<br />
<br />I have a "intellivision" unit which is also an NES on a chip, though it has two 512K byte DIP ROMs, which I desoldered and dumped.  The mapper is an MMC3+extensions like many other pirate carts and such.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, it's not possible to RE too effectively-  I was thinking of making "bankwatch jr" using some special ROMs, but haven't gotten around to it.
