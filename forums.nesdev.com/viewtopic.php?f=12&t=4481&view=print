<br />I don't remember 1 and 3 (probably they only came up with a very recent update ?)
<br />I'll try to explain 2 and 4 :
<br />2) Anti-Resonance is the pseudonyme of a guy, it has nothing to do with the sample decoding method itself (like I originally trough). This is the guy who cracked/figured out how the correct sample decoding for the SNES works, and ticking that box would use a more accurate method to decode samples. Back then leaving that box unchecked make the wind in Chrono Trigger sound like sirens instead, and check it made wind noise. Now I guess they improved their methods, and I don't remember which one souds the more like the wind on the real hardware.
<br />
<br />4) Hi-res is needed for games like Secret of Mana that uses 512 pixels horizontally I belive. If you disable it, SOM won't work. Why you want to do that I don't know.

<br />
<br />Number 1 just mutes the sound when you are recording the movie input frame by frame,  sometimes loading a state if you didn't like the end result of a given frame input.
<br />
<br />Number 3 relates to some games that use registers from the APU as a source of randomness, which is a no go when it comes to consistent playback given a set of input, and a given game state.  Fake mute here is that that the sound register involved is being reported back as a consistent value, even when it is different from the actual sound output.

<br />BSNES is very accurate, but I can't get it to decent speed on my PC. Use it for developping, not for playing (like Nintendulator).
<br />I trought that SNES9x had supperior audio but maybe that changed. "Noise" isn't played loud engough and this changes sound effects significanly in some games.

The only noticeable differences are:<br />- CPU rev. 1 HDMA crashing bug not supported<br />- Auto-joypad polling delay not supported<br />- Reading mul / div registers early doesn't return partially computed data<br />No software could make use of these bugs, so they don't affect games, at least.<br /><br />S-SMP is also nearly perfect, except the timer glitch before the mini-SNES is not supported, and the TEST register won't crash the system like it does on the real thing. Again, no games use that, as it's not a very useful effect to crash the system.<br /><br />S-DSP is bit-perfect sans channel mute. I didn't do any of this work though, it was all blargg's research and code.<br /><br />S-PPU is a hacked up piece of shit. It's a scanline renderer. Although it does emulate all known hardware features, as well as bugs and quirks that nobody else does: $2100 OAM reset, interlace sprite height glitch, etc. We get lucky in that few SNES games need cycle renderers, whereas many NES games do. No SNES emu goes beyond scanline yet.<br /><br />Aside from the S-PPU, they all use the lowest possible level of timing, including even cycle-level bus hold delays. Every CPU and SMP opcode whose cycle-level timings could be verified by tests have been. CPU by myself and anomie, SMP by blargg.<br /><br />You can think of bsnes as Nintendulator with NESticle's PPU renderer.<br /><br />So really, we need to rewrite the S-PPU, add a half-dozen hardware glitches, and it'll be 99.99% as good as you can ever possibly get from emulation. Then we just need to make it all fast. Eg Snestopia. What do you say, Marty? ;)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I've noticed a huge difference between the triforce intro in Zelda for the SNES between Snes9x + bsnes and ZSNES.

<br />
<br />That's due to timing. For some reason, most people seem to think ZSNES is more accurate than Snes9X. In truth, it's just more stable. '9x has a lot of out-of-bounds memory errors that crash the thing (eg MMX3) due to overly-aggressive and dangerous optimizations (passing lots of raw pointers around and such.)
<br />
<br />I always get my tests bit-perfect in my own emulator, and they're usually relatively close with every other emulator. But with ZSNES v1.51 and earlier, the results are off in center field. It's basically overclocked by ~20-30% in most cases, as that helps overall compatibility when timing is bad. And that's why those triforces swing together so quickly.
<br />
<br />ZSNES v2 is supposed to address the timing issues with CPU+SMP, and use blargg's DSP, so it should be a lot better.

<br />You're probably not being objective here, and the emulator was meant to be accurate, not to be a good tool to play games with. If you want to play game you'd want a faster and more user friendly emulator like SNES9x or ZSNES.

<br />I think most people tend to forget (or are unaware) that TV speakers and audio circuitry are usually pretty terrible compared to PC speakers, and are optimized for ordinary TV viewing by default, so of course there are going to be audible differences between the two.

<br />
<br />I believe WedNESday was asking for an overall comparison between emulators. And what I said was true for what most people care about. The vast majority notice CPU usage over minor accuracy things like Zelda's triforce effect timing.
<br />
<br />In truth, we still have to compromise between speed and accuracy, as it's not a linear curve -- rather it's exponential. You lose speed more and more while gaining less and less. Take it too far past modern processing power, and the software loses its mass appeal. I've gotten my software so slow that five out of the seven PCs I have access to can't get 60fps with it: I haven't compromised at all. I have 100% compatibility, and yet I'm still sacrificing speed for accuracy.
<br />
<br />Worse yet is I estimate it'd be within feasibility to roughly double the speed with no accuracy loss by optimizing things*. Much moreso with a few minor compromises. But that would make it a lot harder for me to fix bugs and improve upon the code later. See, I'm going for a strict-research platform, with the goal being to let other emulator authors add my findings to their emulators, but with appropriate speed optimizations. Still, it makes for a lousy, power-wasteful program for general gaming. So until the other emulators catch up -- I suppose it's fairly useful for playing, assuming you have the PC power for it.
<br />
<br />(* I'm <em>really</em> stubborn about the way the code is modeled. It's much faster, for instance, to enslave the SMP to the CPU, yet I keep them separate anyway, because I feel that more closely reflects how the real hardware works. Speed loss with no accuracy gain, and I do that a lot. Long explanation for that <a href="http://byuu.cinnamonpirate.com/articles/optimization" class="postlink">here</a>.)
<br />
<br />And that's really the gist of it. Getting things accurate isn't that hard, getting them fast isn't, either. But getting both -- that takes the real talent.

<br />
<br />First of all, anyone who works a few extra nights flipping burgers can afford a computer capable of running bsnes, and in ten years they'll be able to pick one off the curb capable of running bsnes. It means nothing today that Nesticle can get 60fps on a Pentium 166 and Nestopia can't, it is now a useless trait to be able to do that in exchange for more crashes, more bugs, more headaches. And the same thing happened to ZSNES, which is why they're rewriting almost the entire thing. And I still won't use it, because I still won't like the GUI, and I don't believe they will be willing to do what byuu had to do to get the kind of compatibility assurance he did.
<br />
<br />I'd also point out that there is a dark side to savestates. They can become a dependency for people, and it's easy to accidentally overwrite days of progress. Sometimes when it happens, people will actually bother to register just to complain that it happened, as if we can somehow give them their life back.
