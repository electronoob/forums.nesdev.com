For some reason on both systems the two GND pins on the cart must both be connected.  Only using one of them gets you a voltage of ~3V instead of 5V, likely a grounding issue.  Don't know the exact technical reason, analog is scary!  Have to dig up my Yobo to see if it has the same requirement.
<br />
<br />Also should mention that CHR /A13 and CIRAM /CE must be connected for carts to work on the NEX.  That is why four screen games like Gauntlet and the PowerPak will not work.  They seem to use that as a power switch for the NES cart slot...

Then if both grounds are connected in the cartridge, they should not be connected inside the console too else you'd get very high noise and recive radio on your power supply or something like that.
<br />Maybe it's not the case if the console is shielded proprely and if all PCBs have a ground plane (wich is the case with the NES).

<br />WTF? Having multiple ground lines reduces impedance (resistance), which is a good thing for power supply lines. This is especially good when part of the connection is through the cartridge connector. Consider that stranded copper wire is a bunch of separate conductors in parallel.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually, it's fairly simple : Nintendo designed the cartridge connector with two ground pins to be able to drawn more current without caring about that (anyway, since unless any external supply is used, wich will never be the case in a NES cart, all current in the two ground pins have to be drawn from the single VCC pin, so this really doesn't change much things). Both ground pins are tied together both in cartridges and in the console, creating a ground loop. Since the console is entierely shielded, and both the console PCB and cartridge have ground planes, the ground loop has no negative effect.
<br />
<br />Because famiclones are cheaply made and have probably unproper ground plane and/or shielding, tying both ground pins together in the console would have negative ground loop effects. Because of this, they assumed both ground pins were tied together by the cartridge inserted, so that they don't have to connect them together again in the console to avoid a ground loop. If this isn't done, the reults are hazardous.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When using a cart on the real NES, are there any side-effects to having the two ground pins not connected?  From what is said here, it sounds like Nintendo always connected them but didn't need to.  (I have very little EE knowledge, so my understanding in this field is very limited at best.)
