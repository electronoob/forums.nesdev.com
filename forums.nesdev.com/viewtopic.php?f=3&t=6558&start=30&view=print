<br />It would be great if instead of complete mappers the emulators emulated components, and a cartridge description would indicate the parts that are used and how they are wired up. As long as the emulator knew the chips, it would be able to simulate any cartridge that used them.
<br />
<br />That would even allow homebrewers to create new boards without the pain that is getting an unused iNES number and having the scheme implemented in different emulators.

<br />@etabeta Most of the things discussed here seem to be things favoring "ease" of development, making life easier for minority emulator programmers and cart dumpers. What benefits do you bring to the majority? Nothing really. As such, how are you going to convince them? If you don't care about convincing them then I guess it's irrelevant.
<br />
<br />MAME isn't a good example to use in the console world because it doesn't allow homebrew development in any easy fashion. You would basically have to send out a large personalized MAME.exe that runs your "homebrew" with source included. A project like MAME that has basically walmarted arcade emulation is disappointing in these aspects. RetroCopy supports using any of the arcade boards covered in a homebrew fashion because of its better format.
<br />
<br />Anyhow, my personal belief is these files should not contain only ROM data. It should contain information allowing complete emulation, including things that would be known about the game if you owned it. Such as whether it's 2 player, coop, etc, because these things affect the actual playing or selecting of the game. People are still thinking about what an emulator in 1999 requires to play a game instead of the future, and your "frontend" comment typifies the old thought process etabeta. 
<br />
<br />All criticisms aside, thanks for your (and others) work with this NES XML database as it will save me some time.

<br />
<br />I agree as well on the importance of homebrew games &amp; demos (especially when verified on a 'copier'): they often can be able to push the hardware closer to its limits than some official soft. It's just that I had already a lot of work in front of me to deal with ~3600 'industry' games and I had spent no time to investigate how to exactly deal with homebrew <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />for sure, any self-programmed soft should simply provide the board type (as it is now) or the pins/lines settings (if we externalize more parts of the emulation) and would work... it would already work also in current MESS if you zip up separate PRG and CHR and you manually add the entry to nes.xml!
<br />
<br />also, boards should not be strictly limited to the existing ones (as long as a real NES could cope with them): as an example, I'd love to support the UNIF board used by Drip, if some more docs were available... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />Something that would handle the mappers that just do bankswitching and mirroring selection without modes.
<br />
<br />You just need to specify where the bytes you write to are, what address mask to use, how wide the banks are, and how the bits are shifted, AND'd and OR'd together to create the bank selection for PRG and CHR as well as mirroring.

Most emulators require you to trawl through menus looking for input options, system options, region options, etc, and the everyday user has no idea about these things. It reduces problems such as "why is XXX game having glitches on the screen, i never remember it this way". When maybe a thousand people in the world know that the game doesn't correctly work when you play it on a certain region it is good to have that information somewhere to reduce support issues.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And I agree with tokumaru and RetroRalph about homebrew.

<br />
<br />From discussions with MAME people I have had it seems 99% certain they will never allow homebrew. They use various reasons such as disallowing"current games", historicity, etc. The way I see it if you emulate a system it should be able to run any software developed for that system, not just a hardcoded game. I think the open source license also has certain restrictions in regards to what you can do with this?
<br />
<br />Most current MESS devs seem a bit more relaxed on this, however the MAME "zealots" also work on MESS time to time so at any stage the same "only commercial games" could start applying to if the balance of power switches. As ridiculously dramatic as all this sounds it seems quite silly to me.

<br />It's not really a solution though in my opinion, someone will always want "something more than basic".
<br />
<br />Maybe a real solution could be an "ultimate" mapper that utilizes every bit of power you can get from the NES and is possible (and ideally cheap) in hardware. Then 99% of homebrew developers would use this mapper and never have a need for any other mappers. 
<br />
<br />With one simple restriction "only use NES hardware"  an "ultimate" mapper can be figured out without too much effort. That restriction is to stop the never ending possibilities of say "an ATOM CPU in the cartridge that does all the game processing and a MPEG decoding chip for movie playback". By only using what's available on the NES you can stay faithful to the console. An ultimate mapper would cover 99% of homebrew development, the remaining 1% would never be happy with something that isn't custom I think. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />By "cheap" do you mean MMC3/FME-7 class, or do you mean MMC5? If you're putting up money to have an ASIC designed, I'd support something similar to the FME-7 (old doc <a href="http://nesdev.com/sunsoft.txt" class="postlink">here</a>), perhaps with the ports moved down to $5000 and $5001 so as to stay out of the way of games that save by writing back to the 29F040.

<br />
<br />No I mean something new that allows full use of every NES feature. The FME-7 type mapper is a good start as it gives a lot of flexibility. I haven't put much thought into an ultimate mapper for the NES, but I'm just saying it's another way to solve the problem of wanting "custom mappers". If you have every feature 99% of developers want then you've solved any need for a complex electrical simulation in emulators. Also if there was a standardized "ultimate" mapper that was easily available then NES development would be much more approachable, if it could do everything developers wanted it's also likely it could emulate nearly every existing mapper.
<br />
<br />It's hard to know what cheap means to people, $200-300 is fine for me if the ultimate mapper devcart was nice (drag-&gt;drop USB and large amount of space), but others will only want to pay something like $20-50.

<br />Well, "cheap" can have different meanings depending on the type of cart you're talking about. For a devcart, $200 is an acceptable price (not great, but being a one time deal most people would be able to make the sacrifice eventually), but production carts of the games made with that devcart must be way cheaper, because nobody will pay $200 for a single NES game.

<br />This is a great idea but unfortunately the NES is basically unlimited so this is just not possible. You could have a 4-color frame buffer system and place a PS3 in a cartridge and have 300 million polygons per frame - rendered with 4 colors and 256x240 resolution. With external sound, you're not limited either - as long as you have mono output. You can get a million PCM channels with as many bits and as many high sampling rate you want.
<br />
<br />That being said, Membler's Squeedo is basically what you mention here. An "ultimate" mapper - that if people would really make great games for it would be awesome - but it would end up being not that ultimate as people would keep asking for more.

<br />
<br />you are full of prejudices, my friend... the point is simply that what applies to arcades (MAME) does not fully apply to home systems (MESS)
<br />
<br />1. any software (official+homebrew) can be run in MESS and it is natural that this won't change at any time: half of the fun when emulating old home computers is being able to run the software you might have created back in the days and there are large communities of TI99-4 and Tandy CoCo users which use MESS exactly for this reason
<br />2. even when talking about adding homebrew to xml lists (which got added to MESS to offer some list of 'confirmed' dumps, so that we can avoid bug reports caused by bad images), there are not so many zealots as you might think. to make an example, Arbee is strongly against any homebrew software in MAME, but he fully supports demos &amp; homebrew to be officially listed for home computers like Amiga or consoles like a2600, as long as the software runs on the real hardware
<br />
<br />how all this affects this thread? it's simple: NES homebrew will always be supported by MESS in both iNES and UNIF format. moreover, once I finalize the external xml thing for NES, we might decide to add homebrew to this part of the code as well (again restricting to software which runs on the real hardware)
