I think it's a cool project, and definitely has some potential to make more people aware that development on the NES is more accessible than may be commonly thought.  I'm hoping the game cartridge would be usable as a dev cart, that's been my main suggestion, and it's probably the direction it was heading anyways.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />edit: 10-18-2015<br />The trailer for the film has been released.  Check it out:<br /><a href="https://vimeo.com/142582274" class="postlink">https://vimeo.com/142582274</a>

I've been plugging it where I can, but of course like most kickstarters it starts to slow down after the first few days.<br /><br />Besides the large donations make for the Executive Producer tiers, it seems like most support is for the actual game and not the documentary.  I'm wondering if this would have gained more traction if it was marketed as a game with a documentary, instead of a documentary with a game (or 2 games technically).

Did I understand that right?<br /><br />It's simply too ambitious. Too many KS projects have failed where they were only trying to do one of those things. They don't need to do so much.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Could potentially be <em>three</em> game projects if someone took the $10,000 tier reward. I don't really understand the budget, with only $7200 allocated &quot;the team&quot; of 9 people? This makes me presume that the bulk of the labour has to be unpaid. Either this, or there is additional funding from somewhere else, but that doesn't sound like the case, especially with the $10k tier offer. Anyhow, I don't want to speculate too much about somebody else's money (even though a Kickstarter campaign is an open invitation to do so), just giving my brief assessment here.<br /><br />I am most interested in the documentary part. I think it's clear he's got a talent for that kind of thing, and I would love to see it, even if it ended up being about a failed game. I want to see it all succeed, and I hope it makes it, but I would buy in just for the documentary.

If I was him, I would've come here and see if I could recruit people who actually <em>have</em> experience with the NES, and not some movie composers or fantasy authors or other people of irrelevant professions.  I would also make it entirely about the NES game, with a faux-retro game (which was the base game) being the more accessible version that will make the most money.  Finally, the game just doesn't look interesting or promising, partly due to the game being programmed by someone who isn't a programmer, and the team doesn't have anyone who could think outside the box.

AFAIK, the Battle Kid games are the most successful NES homebrews to date, and even though their engine isn't particularly impressive, the fact that he managed to go come up with all that content and actually finish 2 long games is more than you can say about any other NES programmer today.
