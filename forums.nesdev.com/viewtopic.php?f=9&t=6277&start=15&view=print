		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's what I thought... But interestingly enough, the SKROM doesn't ship with a 32 pin chip in the PRG spot like you'd expect, but a 28 pin one. Though it has holes for a 32 pin chip. Does the fact that they used a different chip in there make a difference at all?
<br />

<br />
<br />And BTW, I have not yet seen an SKROM which has a 32 pin mask ROM chip in there.

<br />
<br />Ok well that makes a lot of sense.
<br />
<br />MottZilla said that pad the rom could be where I went wrong.
<br />So If it don't pad the rom the size is 16k CHR and 64k PRG
<br />
<br />So how do I rewire a 27C128 EPROM and a 27C512 EPROM into an SKROM?

<br />
<br />Sorry I don't have the exact directions, I can't find the board, but one time I wired a 27C512 to a UNROM (128kB) board and that involved bending up a pin and wiring it to somewhere else.  Cutting a trace on the PCB IMHO is easier than wiring to bent pins, if you have something sharp enough to cut into fiberglass.
<br />
<br />Here are the NES ROM pinouts:
<br /><a href="http://nesdev.com/NES%20ROM%20Pinouts.txt" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/NES%20ROM%20Pinouts.txt</a>
<br />
<br />If you compare those to EPROM pinouts it's pretty simple.   The only real difference to keep in mind is that some size EPROMs will have a dedicated 'VPP' (programming voltage) pin, just make sure that's wired to VCC (+5V).  The pinouts are mostly identical.

<br />
<br />If you use UCON64 or another program to "pad" the files the wrong data will appear on the cartridge possibly. The proper thing to do is as in my previous post, copy the file onto itself until it is up to size. copy /b on the command line will let you do this. Read my previous post, it should be pretty clear. If it's not, anyone here can help you with it.

<br />And you probably want to wire /WE (write) to VCC too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I didn't think of that, but that would allow him to fix his current non-working cartridge by desoldering the upper address lines (provided he knows which ones are above the actual data and just related to padded data) and fixing their position. But this is another good reason to just properly mirror data to fill the chip up. Then it's one less issue to worry about. Mirroring opposed to padding is very simple.
