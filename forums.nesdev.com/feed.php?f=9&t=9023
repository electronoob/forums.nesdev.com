If it's any easier for you, you could just use a larger chip and fill it with the same 8KB over and over. Whatever you decide to do, the basic rewiring rule doesn't change: match pins and holes that are labeled the same. When in doubt (sometimes /OE, /CE and such are not labeled consistently), compare the the pinouts of a 32KB mask ROM and a 32KB EPROM or FlashROM known to work without any rewiring, and use that as a reference.<br /><br />EDIT: Checking out the documentation for mapper 68, I really can't see why they'd NEED it. The original game was NROM, meaning it had no CHR bankswitching at all. Japanese needs more characters than english, so it's not like they needed any expansion there. NROM also doesn't have any mirroring control, so I can't see why they'd need that. The PRG switching capabilities of mapper 68 are exactly the same as UNROM, one of the simplest and most common mappers around.<br /><br />The only feature of this mapper that they might have used is the ability to map ROM for the name tables, maybe for a title screen or something of the sort, but that would be a very lazy thing to do.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Jun 19, 2012 8:32 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">DNSDies wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Am I missing anything?<br /></div><br /><br />Seems like quite an extreme mapper to require, for a translation of an NROM game.  Unforunately, I would say unless the developers who made this translation/hack tested with this mapper (rather than an emulator), there's a good chance that it won't work..  Emulators tend to be really lenient, particularly regarding mapper initialization.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Jun 19, 2012 4:40 pm</p><hr />

I'm trying to use a sunsoft game to play a romhack (english translation of Portopia Serial Murders) that requires that specific mapper. The PRG rom is a simple 28 pin drop and solder, but the CHR rom on the board is a 32 pin 128KB rom with the following specs:<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/QYSZF.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I need to drop an 8KB CHR rom to replace that, but it's putting a 28 pin rom into a 32 pin hole.<br />It looks like it mostly matches, the only rewire I see is sending VCC to pin 28 from hole 32.<br /><br />The donor cart I'm using is Maharaja.<br />Am I missing anything?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5283">DNSDies</a> — Tue Jun 19, 2012 11:12 am</p><hr />
