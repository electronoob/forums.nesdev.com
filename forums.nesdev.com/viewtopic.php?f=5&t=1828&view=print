		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Due to a problem that occurred on Wikipedia, I have decided to change the username that I am using on all of the recreational websites that I frequently access. Barring unforeseen technical issues, my new username will be <strong>85cocoa</strong>. (I came up with the idea because of <a href="http://www.lindtusa.com/shop_product_detail.cfm?PID=28&amp;PageNum_GetProducts=1&amp;ProductShopBy=Excellence" class="postlink">this chocolate product</a>.) I will abandon my -_pentium5.1_- account, but its e-mail address will still be valid for at least several years. I will use a different e-mail address to create my new account, and it will be hidden from my new profile to prevent spam problems. I will post back here once the new account has been successfully created.

<br />Clarification: The problem that occurred on Wikipedia is that I was blocked because of the "Pentium" in my username. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Pentium5dot1" class="postlink">(link)</a>
<br />
<br />If I bend &amp; stretch my new username to make it fit MediaWiki specs, will it be acceptable for Wikipedia? (Perhaps tepples has some advice here?)

<br />
<br />Clarification: I basically acted too abruptly out of shock at the enormity of my Wikipedia sin. I have updated my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Pentium5dot1" class="postlink">Wikipedia user talk page</a> with a slightly clearer explanation, and <a href="http://www.snes9x.com/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=2837" class="postlink">this equivalent thread on the Snes9x forums</a> also explains the issue. This kind of mistake is triggered in part by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome" class="postlink">this condition</a>; it's the same reason that tepples was unintentionally disrespectful about NESdevWiki's server dying <span style="font-size: 75%; line-height: normal">(apologies to tepples)</span>.

<br /><div class="quotetitle">blargg wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I also liked your original Pentium nickname, with the extraneous characters added.</div>Oh well, that's what I get for acting on impulse. However:<div class="quotetitle">On my Wikipedia user talk page, I wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">but since I am now trying to cleanly break all ties to my "-_pentium5.1_-" username all over the Internet...</div>What I meant by this is that I prefer to be consistent about my usernames, so if one "pentium-something-or-other" is bad, then they are all bad in my mind. As I tried to explain on the Snes9x boards, I acted so abruptly because I suddenly became disgusted at how I was "unwittingly and unwarrantedly" promoting the Intel Pentium line of microprocessors.

<br />
<br />As for why you think you would be punished, you're overreacting in a rather extreme way - this is just a discussion forum.
