		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys,<br />I know what some will say but I really want to have a X3 cart to play on real hardware.  I live in Australia and Mega Man X3 is fetching some ridiculous prices.<br />Anyway I managed to grab a X2 donor from Japan and want to do a basic 2 x 27C801 eprom exchange to it for X3.<br />I used the same pinout I have used for Star Fox 2 repro.  I wired up all 64 pads with wires and split the PAL X3 rom in 2 and wrote have to each eprom.  I just get a blank screen.<br />I have checked all wiring and it is all correct.<br />Does X2 carts have a different pinout to the regular SNES mask roms?  Do I need to patch the rom first before I can make it work?<br /><br />I read another thread about doing this the other way using a X3 PCB to make a X2 and it mentioned patching the rom.<br />If someone can help that would be great.  This is purely for my personal use and collection.

There's no difference.  I doubt this could be the issue, but there have been some reports that sometimes the OE and CE lines are switched.  It's might be worth investigating.<br />As far as splitting the rom, it should be split at the highest address point (someone correct me here if I'm wrong )-- at the $1FFFF.  I'm going off memory here as I am away from the computer.

I use Wasabi to split the file into 2 pieces which does run correctly in an emulator.<br />I just read somewhere that when trying to put X2 onto a X3 cart the rom needed to be patched.  I removed all the hookup leads and soldered  the original mask roms back in and the cart works with X2 I know that the cart is working.<br />I might try soldering all the cables on again.  Might have missed one.

Mega man X2 enables the second ROM, Mega man X3 doesn't? <br /><br />You may have to patch the ROM or rewire the board.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There is a register in the Cx4 that determines whether the upper ROM bank is mapped to a single ROM (like in MMX3), or whether it's mapped to a second ROM (like in MMX2).  You'd need to patch MMX3 to set that register properly in order to use MMX2 as a donor board.  I don't remember exactly which register it is, sorry.  There's a couple of ways you could get around this in hardware, but the easiest would be to use a single 16Mbit ROM wired up to the ROM1 pads, then manually wire the high address line to pin 34 on the Cx4 chip.
