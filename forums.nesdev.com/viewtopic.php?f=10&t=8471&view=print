		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have been watching this form for awhile and have decided to jump in and try to make my own cartridges. Here is my little introduction. I have a side job and run a small vacuum forming co. in my basement. We make reproduction inserts / bubbles for toys from the 80's. We also make full size stormtrooper armor. Right now we are taking a break from these items and will restart after the new year. We recently have started working on molds for mini and table top arcades. We hope these will be easy to assemble and then you could modify your nintendo NES and Gameboys for the arcade kits. However, I am a huge collector of NES games. I would love to put some of the homebrew games on a cart and play them on the arcades we are making. I want to start buying the tools and this is were my questions start. 
<br />
<br />
<br />I have a few basic questions so I can get started. 
<br />
<br />What type of Soldering Iron? What voltage?
<br />What gauge of wire?
<br />Do I need a multimeter?
<br />Would this EPROM Programmer  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="workhttp://www.ebay.com/itm/PCB6-0-USB-EPROM-programmer-BIOS-PIC-AVR-Ship-USA-/220918601349?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item336fc65685">workhttp://www.ebay.com/itm/PCB6-0-USB- ... 336fc65685</a><!-- m -->
<br />I see there a ton of different types of C27 EPROM's, how do I know which one to buy?
<br />Do I need anything else?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Soldering Iron, no more than 15 watts. Wire gauge should probably be 22 or less as in thicker. Multi-meters are handy but not required. The EPROM programmer you linked looks as though it supports the common 8bit eproms for use in NES reproductions. No you don't need anything else. All you are doing is replacing the memory, a MASKROM, with another memory, an EPROM, to change the game in the cartridge. It's very simple. The only time it's more complicated is in a few special cases where major changes are made to the board for some reason, such as Final Fantasy III (Famicom) could require modifications since there is no exact donor.

When melting lots of solder like on the RF or AC adapter joints you don't want to wait forever. And get a plug-in one. And a sponge to clean your tip on and also maybe 1-2 extra tips just in case.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you want to do it right get yourself a Weller soldering iron with adjustable temperature setting.  It'll cost quite a bit more than others but it'll last forever and meet any needs you have.  I use one everyday and constantly adjust the temperature setting.  Mine goes from 350-850F but I'm always between 500-700.  I do very similar soldering work and made a few carts myself and I wouldn't want to be working at 800F personally, nor can I imagine you'd want to be for this type of work.  Something like a WESD51, it'll run ya $200 or more.  But if you're serious about this it's worth every penny.
<br />
<br />They little $20 or less de-soldering irons from radioshack with the red bulb are great.
<br />
<br />I also can't imagine not having a multimeter.  No offense but if you're the type of person that doesn't own a multimeter this is going to be a challenge for you.  Yes you could get by without one, but good luck finding out what's wrong without it, you'll be in the dark.  Or even having it to check for shorts from Vcc to GND.  Make this mistake one time and you'll need to replace your NES.  You can get one that'll work for less than $10.
<br />
<br />As for size of EPROMS buy the ones that you need for what you're making or larger.  There isn't one answer for this question.  These are the types of things you'll need to research and learn up about.
<br />
<br />22ga or larger seems pretty big too me.  I wouldn't want to deal with anything larger than 24ga personally.  I use 28ga and would recommend something from 24-28ga.  I do use 30ga occasionally but I would say it's a little small for this task.  And I like to use a flux pen I picked up off Digikey, just make sure you use flux of some sort (the stuff in the solder doesn't count).
<br />
<br />Also if you're using EPROMS you'll probably want an eraser.  And I would recommend a cartridge dumper or some sort to help troubleshoot problems when they arrise.  
<br />
<br />What kind of mold capabilities do you have with your vacuum molds?  Are you able to make cartridge plastics? Do you have any links or pictures of past projects with your moldings? Because that is something that could be useful around here.  
<br />
<br />I'm also curious about these table top arcades you're making.  I'm kind of confused on how this kit idea is supposed to work by modifying the NES/Gameboy, especially when you're asking these basic questions...

<br />I got the idea of making kits from this video.<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MblnbUURHjY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MblnbUURHjY</a><!-- m -->

<br />I want to make an easy plastic kit to assemble. To order just the arcade box from him cost 70 dollars. If I can get a good mold I could charge way less. 
<br />
<br />I have never solder before but have watched many video's. I know I will mess up a few time, but I figured if I bought the right tools from the start it would be much easier. 
<br />
<br />I could make cases and other objects with the former. Just need to know what people need. 
<br />
<br />I recently traded a stormtrooper armor for 400 nes games. I was thinking about offering them for sale to be made in reproductions. 
<br />
<br />My wife was kind enough to buy me a vacuum chamber and pressure pot to do custom casting. This is another outlet I have.

Not that it really matters, but I still don't see how one could provide a "simple" kit to rip their GBA apart to make something comparable to that.  But yet your making one that you pack your NES or SNES into?  And you're trying to produce homebrew games for people to put inside them?  I guess you're still in early stages but I would still think your a little ahead of yourself...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I recently traded a stormtrooper armor for 400 nes games.

<br />
<br />If you're able to make up some cases for NES games at a low price of $1-2 each I think some people would be interested myself included.  But I'm not really sure on how you could do this well with vacuum molding, it seems you'd have a hard time holding the PCB in place well.  I've never played around with vacuum molding before though so maybe you've got some ideas.

<br />
<br />I had a very similar idea. So I ended up building this. <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Genuine-NES-Bartop/" class="postlink">http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Genuine-NES-Bartop/</a>.  It is still a bit big, and using something like a PS1 screen is what I would probably go for next.  I'm not sure if you have heard of the PowerPak, but you can load it up with all the homebrew your heart could handle (as demonstrated in the instructable).

<br />That instructable is the one who inspired me to make my own table top arcade machine. It is very cool. Great work. I have seen the powerpak, it seems a little to high for me. I also like the idea of see cartridge artwork while I play.

<br />If only the PowerPak menu system were a bit more open, it might be possible to make a menu that looks like a bunch of carts on a shelf, and then show the label while the cart is loading. I made a mock-up some time ago:

<br />
<br />Yeah I didn't think it would work so well.  That's a pretty good starting price actually.  I've checked with some online places and the molds were running at least $5k for one side.  One thought I had to lower starting cost was to have a shell that would mate up with itself.   That way you would only need one mold for both halves.   The down side being that nothing would prevent you from putting the cart in upside down except maybe a label.
