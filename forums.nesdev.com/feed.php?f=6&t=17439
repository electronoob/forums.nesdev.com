If you are going for conserving space it is indeed the best solution, especially when you want to simultaneously do something unusual for an NES game. I once wrote a demo song that tries to sound &quot;advanced&quot; while only using the base hardware features, including a looped DPCM waveform made from an FM bass guitar patch.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6362">za909</a> — Wed Jun 13, 2018 4:05 pm</p><hr />

Lidnariq, these samples might prove invaluable to me.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" /> <br />After trying them on, building more a quite well rounded instrument with a decent tri volume in under or about 1k seems very doable, which isn't all that costly. Some ranges and some few notes will have to go, but that's not too much of a problem. <br /><br />A side effect: The longer samples, if not looped, can act as short notes. <br />And all samples can be used as note stops in the same way. <br />Silencing a looped note will make a hard pop, so they're best for drones as-is, but just playing a one-shot sample won't pop. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />BTW the one game that used looped 17-byte DPCM for a pitched instrument (The Immortal, Rob Hubbard) just took the &quot;one semitone down is close enough to 16/17&quot; approach<br /></div><br />Cool to hear a song from the commercial era to use it! <br /><br />I'm not too worried about some of the notes being a little honkey tonk (though some of the upper notes in my sample are unusable of course), as long as they don't play solo. The beating swell of the detune can sometimes act complementary, especially for the delta artifacts which go in and out. But the detuning can also get old quickly, so lidnariqs triangle library will be useful in that regard too. <br /><br /><br />Something i found interesting is that there seems to be some cancellation based, airy movement happening in between the alias noises of both the tri channel and the DPCM, presumably because the delta artifacts' phases clash asynchronously. You can control how much by using samples with more or less evident artifacts. It sort of reminds me of a rotary electric organ.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Wed Jun 13, 2018 6:01 am</p><hr />

If you wanted it to be closer in tune, you could replace Famitracker's A440-based tuning table with one that more closely matches the DPCM's accidental 16/17 detuning of A440 system. Well, in this case, 16/17 + 100 cents, since the 16/17 is already being approximated by a semitone shift.<br /><br />If you want to make something that works in both NTSC and PAL you'd need separate tuning tables, though Famitracker's driver does have that.<br /><br />There's an example tune I made a long time ago to demonstrate this, including a script to generate the tuning table:<br /><a href="http://famitracker.com/forum/posts.php?id=3424" class="postlink">http://famitracker.com/forum/posts.php?id=3424</a><br /><br />There's an old thread on the topic of the apparently intended tuning of the DPCM frequencies, and also how they're bad at their goal, especially on PAL where two of the chosen frequencies seem to be off-by-one:<br /><a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=5473" class="postlink">http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=5473</a><br /><br />Optimizing the tuning to match the very imprecise DPCM frequencies might be splitting a rather frizzy hair, though. There will be detuning no matter what while doing this, but replacing the tuning tables will at least centre that detuning.<br /><br />My main complaint about the DPCM freqs is not actually that they made the mistake with loop lengths that adds an extra byte, but that <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=92497#p92497" class="postlink">it has so few octaves that are in tune with each other</a>, so that looped or not you can't even count on that to be in tune, whether or not you adjust your other tuning tables.<br /><br /><br />BTW the one game that used looped 17-byte DPCM for a pitched instrument (The Immortal, Rob Hubbard) just took the &quot;one semitone down is close enough to 16/17&quot; approach:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXcnA_4OnkQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXcnA_4OnkQ</a><!-- m --><br /><br />(...also you can use longer looped samples, each length has a different detuning based on that +1 byte. 32/33, 48/49, etc.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Tue Jun 12, 2018 9:10 am</p><hr />

It warrants making sure nothing important is left in the RAM space the both drivers use and try to keep it overlapped between them, but should be fine. <br /><br />At first i thought it was a little extravagant, but then i remembered that it isn't without its precursor. Metroid has a separate driver in each level data bank, even if they're the same and simpler.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Tue Jun 12, 2018 4:56 am</p><hr />

Oh i see. So the sample rate would hypothetically need to be higher and/or the dynamic width of the waveform narrower for the slewed slopes to have less impact on something as abrupt as a square, since we can only increment/decrement one unit at a time. <br /><br />In this case, i'm using E-3 and F-3 (so only two notes) for a quiet drone which the rest plays against. Or that's the idea, currently makeshifted with the mmc5 extension. I guess the sunsoft method is best for notes with decay, for the same reason i get the stutter when looping. Maybe detuning the whole composition as a setup phase would work best here, even if it may result in discomfort between different songs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Mon Jun 11, 2018 8:43 am</p><hr />

Thanks! I can't believe i missed that. <br /><br />The process so far has been opening Audacity, then in the menus: generate &gt; tone &gt; (enter the frequency), ok. <br /><br />then snip out one perfect duty, export it as .wav, and import into famitracker. Even with the new frequency, it yields a B.<br /><br /> If i add several duties in a string (which seems a little wasteful?), i do get the intended frequency but with a looping stutter. It also looks more lite a triform than a square in the oscilloscope view and sounds the part.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Mon Jun 11, 2018 7:18 am</p><hr />
