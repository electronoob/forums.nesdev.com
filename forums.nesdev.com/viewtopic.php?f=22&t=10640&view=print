These boards are configured at manufacturing time to support the mapper circuits required by several games.  Among them are <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=4038" class="postlink"><em>Holy Diver</em></a> by IREM (#78.3) and <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=657" class="postlink"><em>Batman: Return of the Joker</em></a> by Sunsoft (#69).  Putting those titles together results in <a href="http://holysmokesbatman.com/" class="postlink">something Burt Ward as Dick &quot;Robin&quot; Grayson might say</a>: &quot;Holy diver, Batman!&quot;<br /><br />To make testing easier before he ships the product, he has commissioned a test ROM that automatically detects the mapper, PRG ROM size, PRG RAM size and battery backup, and CHR ROM/RAM and size. It tests every byte of RAM on the cart and basic functionality of the mapper, though nowhere near as thoroughly as blargg's tests. If something is seriously wrong, it beeps out 2 or 3 letters of Morse code describing the error; your local ham can interpret these for you. Otherwise, it displays the results on the screen and beeps them through the speaker.<br /><br />It's also useful for people learning to make NES reproductions. If you can successfully make a Holy Diver Batman cart on a given board, you can reproduce most games that use the same board.<br /><br />Supported mappers: SxROM (1), UxROM (2), TxROM (4), AxROM (7), PNROM (9), FxROM (10), INL-ROM Action 53 (28), BNROM (34), NROM/CNROM/GNROM (66), JxROM (69), IF-12 (78.3), TxSROM (118), UxROM (180)<br /><br />Try <strong><a href="http://pineight.com/nes/#hdbm" class="postlink">Holy Diver Batman 0.01</a></strong> on your devcart.<br /><br /><strong>To avoid trademark problems, the project is renamed to Holy Mapperel as of version 0.02.</strong>

I think it'd work for detecting TSROM vs TKROM well, although a faulty TKROM (eg no battery) Would probably still pass as TKROM because of the diodes and caps protecting that supply from being drained by the NES.  It takes a few mins for a TKROM with missing battery to discharge the cap and corrupt data.

Fixed up with your suggestion and compiling assembly files just fine now.  No need for another release, I'd rather just stick with my current build anyways.  Hopefully after I can get some of this flash identifying code written up in the near future.  That might be a good time to release for new ca65.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've successfully modified drivers.s in order to read flash manf/device ID's from PRG flash and CHR flash on NROM flash cart.<br /><br />Some things should probably be moved around to a more appropriate location as my understanding is only mapper specific code belongs in the driver.  I'm proposing a new file flash.s which would provide code in the prg-rom that doesn't get copied to RAM with the driver.  With that setup the only code in the drivers would be prg flash sensing which is the only code that NEEDS to run from RAM.<br /><br />I've pretty well settled on my hardware design for flashable discrete mapper boards.  I discussed it over <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=10357&amp;start=15#p120040" class="postlink">here</a> which turned out to be pretty accurate.  I've confirmed that there is indeed not enough address setup time before PRG R/W goes low.  Driving /CE with ~M2 works great for my NROM board, I'll try BNROM next, but all signs point to success with this method.<br /><br />PRG flash ROM<br />/OE -&gt; PRG /CE<br />/CE -&gt; ~M2<br />/WE -&gt; PRG R/W<br /><br />Here is code where I read the manf &amp; device ID from a NROM, which has been tested and working on hardware.  Reading CHR flash ID's works too, but isn't as interesting...<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;;WR $5555, 0xAA &nbsp; &nbsp;unlock cycle #1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$AA<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $5555<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;WR $2AAA, 0x55 &nbsp; &nbsp;unlock cycle #2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$55<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2AAA<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;WR $5555, 0x90 &nbsp; &nbsp;software ID entry command<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$90<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $5555<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;RD $0000, Manf ID to get /OE low, read from $8000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ldx $8000&nbsp; &nbsp;;Manf ID = 0xBF for SST<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ldy $8001&nbsp; &nbsp;;Device ID = 0xB5,B6,B7 for SST39SF010A, 020A, 040 respectively<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;WR $xxxx, 0xF0 &nbsp; &nbsp;software ID exit command.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$F0&nbsp; &nbsp;;exitID&nbsp; &nbsp;flash won't work as ROM again until this command is given.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $5000&nbsp; &nbsp;;write to flash anywhere ($0000-$7FFF)<br /></div><br /><br />I'm sticking with my idea (or at least would like to support) to use NOR gates on a UNROM board which gives a free inverter.  Only difference there is that PRG A14 gets inverted in that case.  Which moves $5555-&gt;$1555, and $2AAA-&gt;6AAA.  So $1555 conflicts with RAM mirrored down to $0555.  That's pretty much smack dab in the middle of RAM.  Shouldn't be too much of an issue so long as the driver isn't there, I'm guessing it is though...  Chances are as long as I clean up after myself and temporarily store the value (code) in $0555 and then restore it I'll be safe.  If those few (~8) instructions happen to land in the same exact spot you'd stomp over yourself though.  What's the best way to avoid that with the driver code?<br /><br />As an aside, any idea what happens when you write to $2002 PPUSTATUS?  Guessing/hoping nothing, or at most resets the latch just like a read does.  It'd be a bummer if it didn't decode the difference between R/W and caused a bus conflict when writting to $2002 and it's mirrors.

It might be easier to keep all the chr flash detecting in one location though.  Assuming the flash detection was called after all other testing/sensing was complete, the chr flash detection could do everything from flash.s since it would know the mapper and board config.  Either way would work though, doesn't make much difference either way.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Right now the driver is $0300-$04FF or thereabouts IIRC, but we planned to extend it to 3 pages. I could do that by changing the link script to move the mapper driver's run address down to $0200 and moving OAM up to $0700.</div>That'd work for me!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Ignored in an authentic NES, as lidnariq mentioned. You could verify it in Visual 2C02 if you want. But some famiclones that support enhanced graphics modes might be using w2002 for something.</div>Good to know it won't be an issue on the NES, if it is an issue on clones that choice could be for the developer to decide how to handle.  Similar to whether one would choose to use 4 screen mirroring.  There are options to keep the unlock registers from conflicting with RAM.  For one, most homebrews appear to be 256KB these days which means there is no free inverter to be had on UOROM.  For UOROM you could use standard OR gates and then a single inverter to generate ~M2 keeping commands at $2AAA/$5555.
