Nah, switching between different unregulated power supplies won't change things much.<br /><br />An obvious workaround (although it's suboptimal for other reasons) is to use a newer-style switching DC power supply of 7-10V or so. They won't emit any 120Hz (from the NES's AC transformer and full-wave rectifier) and so should make the waves invisible (because the switching frequency will be in range of 10s to 100s of kilohertz)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Sun Oct 12, 2014 12:54 pm</p><hr />

Fair enough. As I've mentioned many times in this thread, I'm relatively new at this level of repair work. I've replaced the pin-connectors before, that's it.

Well there's more than one capacitor in there. <br /><br />If any of them are doing a shitty job of filtering power (that's their job, and they retire at age 15) then that will be making it through to the video signal. Nobody replaces one capacitor and calls it quits. I wouldn't really expect replacing one capacitor would make a difference to be honest. Would you replace one spark plug in your car? Btw I think if there's any capacitors I've NOT replaced, it's the big ones. They seem to hang in there longer and I don't usually have them on hand. All the little ones have to go.<br /><br />I think that's what 3gen is talking about here. Until you replace them all there's not much point in looking deeper.<br /><br />edit: This assumes your power supply is putting out nice, clean power. New capacitors won't fix a terrible power supply.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6643">nestendo</a> — Sun Oct 12, 2014 11:43 am</p><hr />

As was mentioned earlier, the main 2200 cap has already been replaced with no effect. If you know another capacitor that could potentially be the culprit, suggest which one it is. There is very little information available on this problem online and most people who have encountered it on other boards that I've read either don't report the progress of any solutions or just forget about it.

They move down slowly while the NES is on, as if it were beating between 60.1 Hz (NES and Super NES vertical frequency) and 60 Hz (fluorescent bulbs or PSUs) or 59.94 Hz (vertical frequency of other video equipment). I'll have to count the beats more precisely to see which.<br /><br />EDIT: I just measured it, and it takes about 20 seconds for the wiggles to progress all the way down the screen and wrap around twice.

So. Picture shows a varying frequncy, so is some kind of FM. Frequency seems to vary from 1280kHz to 1240kHz, by counting pixels and comparing to the known pixel clock. Assuming output has been (incorrectly) deinterlaced by the television, two subsequent frames show almost identical timing <em>and phase</em>, except in the middle of the frame where the boxer's gloves are. So whatever signal's been modulated, it's basically only got multiples of 60Hz in it. (Specifically ... looks like 120 Hz plus some higher even multiple for the asymmetry) If it were a beat pattern against mains or NTSC frequencies, it would shift by a half scanline or 70% of a scanline every vblank—too small to see in this picture, I think.<br /><br />Question: just how stable are these waves? do they move while the NES is on?
