		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello!
<br />
<br />I am not a programmer, but I am very interested in becoming one.
<br />I make music with Famitracker and MML, and I am especially interested in the VRC6.
<br />I want to make a cart flasher (I think?) for the Famicom so I can put stuff on cartridges.
<br />I also want to make an FC dev cart with VRC6.
<br />Eventually I want to make my own game, but for now I just want to play the VRC6 NSF's I make on actual hardware.
<br />
<br />While I've seen lots of cool stuff for the NES, like <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=47802&amp;sid=134b259aeec3c9dfe66418d46ac3a1bc" class="postlink">this thread</a>, I can't find any information for making Famicom carts.
<br />Also <a href="http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~tns/" class="postlink">this</a> looked interesting, but I unfortunately cannot read Japanese, so I don't really understand if what it is.
<br />
<br />
<br />If a VRC6 cart is too difficult for a first project, I'd like to start with a normal cart.
<br />
<br />Any help would be greatly appreciated, as I really don't know what I'm talking about :D

There are only two ways to get one of those: <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>Rip open one of the dwindling supply of VRC6 games for each copy that you plan to make. </li><li>Decap and photomicrograph a VRC6, write out its netlist in Verilog, and get an ASIC synthesized and fabricated. </li></ol>
<br />If you just want to listen to your NSFs, a PowerPak through the right 72-to-60-pin converter might be the easiest way to do so on a time==money basis.
<br />
<br />I'd imagine that most people with a system capable of playing Famicom expansion sound can read Japanese because they bought a Famicom while living in Japan. (Those who imported a Famicom or modded their NES are a slim minority, despite their overrepresentation here and on NintendoAge.) If you can't read Japanese, stick with normal carts. Those are easy to make; kits for NROM (#000), CNROM (#003), UNROM (#002), BNROM (#034), AOROM (#007), and S*ROM (#001) are available from retrousb.com.

<br />
<br />You can make an VRC6 cart, the most difficult part is probably to find one... you'd have to import one of the 3 japanese games that used it.
<br />
<br />As tepples said, the powerpak is probably the easiest/best way to go, but keep in mind that the VRC6 chip itself might not be 100% accurately emulated, it's possible that the powerpak could act differently from a real VRC, but as long as you stick to regular things, it'll be ok. If you rely on really weird "tricks" on those channels (like the semi-doccumented "direct-offset" mode of pulse channels) then you're blind without an actual VRC cart.
<br />
<br />After that it's probably not a problem to open it and replace it with wathever ROMs you want in it, as long as you don't replace them by a commercial game and sell it for a higher price (which thankfully doesn't seem to be your intentions at all) it'll be ok. It's a Konami cart, not Nintnedo so things are actually easier : You won't have to cut traces and add tiny wires.

<br />
<br />I guess I'll learn Japanese! This would be so much easier because most of the information I want to read is Japanese. I know its impractical but I really like the Famicom carts, and I'm willing to put a lot of time and effort into making a flasher and homebrew carts similar to the ones RetroUSB offers for the NES. I think it would be interesting and fun to learn about programming and electronics, I'm not looking for a fast an cheap method. But I don't know where to start. I read a little about molding plastic, because I want to make my own cases. But I other than that I don't know what to do.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Sorry for rambling on.
<br /><strong>TL;DR:</strong> How do I go about making a normal (no VRC6) Famicom cart and cart flahser? If you don't know can you point me in the right direction so I can figure it out myself please?
<br />
<br />Thanks in advance!

Every time you put new ROMs into a VRC6 game, that's one fewer copy of that game. And if you make a game in a Latin-alphabet language (e.g. English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Esperanto), and you distribute cartridges to the public, most players will have a 72-pin NES that has <em>not</em> been modified for expansion sound passthrough.
<br />
<br />In the following paragraph, try plugging the bold words into Google:
<br />
<br />Once you have your game, you'll want to open the game's case, desolder the PRG ROM, and solder in a <strong>DIP socket</strong>. Then you'll want to store your program on a <strong>flash memory</strong> chip (<strong>29F040</strong> series is common) using an <strong>EPROM programmer</strong> such as one made by <strong>Wellon</strong> or <strong>Willem</strong>. Then pop the ROM into the socket and hope it works. Most boards made by Nintendo need a few wires to be rerouted due to cost- and space-saving shortcuts that Nintendo took, but <strong>ReproPak</strong> boards from retrousb.com won't need rewiring.

<br />I 100% agree. I'd be furious about someone mass-massacring Akumajo Densetsu, Esper Dream II or Madara carts to sell his own game on it. However, talking about supplies, decaping and netlists as an answer to his very first post on NESdev might be a little inapropriate... He never talked about mass production I think.
