These days the solution is to disable encryption on the CPU and run decrypted ROMs.

How would you go about disabling sound encryption? Trust me, I looked it up before asking you. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Edit: It appears Major Title 2 doesn't share Gunforce's problem of not being able to address enough program data. At least, I've seen YouTube videos of both R-Type Leo and Geo Storm using the Major Title 2 board, and it doesn't appear to be tinkered.

Of course, there's no way of knowing because Gunforce II doesn't have any credits. Text for it might exist in the program rom though.

Haven't played any after this and don't care to.) I enjoy playing Gunforce II much more. The one thing I can appreciate more about Metal Slug though is the difficulty; Gunforce II has to be the easiest arcade game around. I would have loved to see a true sequel to Gunforce II, but never mind the real business reasons we never got it and got Metal Slug instead, your characters presumably die at the end of the game anyway. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />
