		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So for the past few days I have been researching as much as possible about the M82, now i am new to the whole NES modification scene and only have basic knowledge of circuitry. ( I at least can identify parts with a little poking around )<br />My questions are as follows:<br />1. is it possible to make a pre-cart boot system kind of like the game genie and the 100-1 units have ( menu system )<br />2. how to go about switching between the carts because I know for a fact that switching the +5v is not the answer (data lines drawing power as well)<br />3. a push-button counter switch circuit (having a hard time finding one)<br /><br />I have more questions and I am sure there will be more but I can't think of any at the moment, any help would be appreciated
