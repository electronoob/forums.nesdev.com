<br />Nah it's fine, And plus neither computer is mine so I have to find one somewhere that I can then tear into.....my PC right now is just a flashdrive with like 100 programs on it I made or more, all kinda of languages, and they take up %0.1 of the 8GB drive....
<br />
<br />
<br />The system of how it takes a opcodes main part and deciphers the registers it uses, memory location, and addressing mode, value, etc....I tried figuring out from a 6502 assembler in Javascript but....yeah....It wasn't pretty <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle">65024U wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">All I hear is good stuff about Ubuntu....Hmm...</div><br /><br />Well then!  Let me give you some contrast!<br /><br />I've been on Ubuntu for about a year now.  Let me tell you some of my tales:<br /><br />----------------------<br /><strong>Installing new programs sucks unless the programs come from the repositories.</strong><br /><br />Finding binaries for Linux online that you can just download and run is a rare conveinience.  Most expect you to download the source and compile it.<br /><br />Often, this means downloading and installing all of the program's dependencies.  Which is easy if the dependencies are available in the repositories (and the repositories have the right version of the dependencies).  Otherwise you have to find them yourself and hope that installing other packages won't destroy packages you already have installed (read:  it will destroy them).<br /><br />I had the pleasure of trying to install some WinAmp clone that someone recommended (which turned out to be incredibly lame).  Afterwards, dozens of my installed packages were broken, and every time I wanted to install a new package I got error messages saying my package versions were incompatible.  But of course it didn't tell me WHICH packages were causing the problem.<br /><br />After about 15 minutes of trial and error... trying to downgrade different package versions in order to fix the problem, I got everything straightened out (until a week later when I tried to install something else -- then a whole new set of broken packages surfaced and I had to repeat the process).<br /><br /><br />Oh, also, I tried installing BSNES.  But I didn't have QT on my system.  So I tried installing QT, but the repositories had an outdated version because I don't update my OS every week like I guess you're supposed to.<br /><br />Long story short, after about 2 hours of dicking around trying to compile BSNES, I gave up and just got the Windows binary and ran it in Wine.<br /><br />I still don't have a Linux binary.<br /><br />-------------------<br /><strong>Linux likes to waste your time and make you jump through hoops to do simple tasks</strong>.<br /><br />My sister has a external hard drive with a USB plug that she keeps a bunch of music and stuff on.  I wanted to copy some stuff onto it for her.<br /><br />So I plug the drive in my computer and try to copy files to it.  I mean it should be that simple, right?<br /><br />Of course not!  Linux doesn't want to mount the drive because it's NTFS.  Note that NTFS <strong>IS</strong> supported, and there really shouldn't be any problem.  But instead of just mounting the drive so I can use it, <em>it tells me to open a command prompt and type some bullshit to mount the drive</em>.<br /><br />Note this is the mounter that's telling me to do this.  Not only that, but it tells me <em>verbatim</em> exactly what I need to type to mount the drive.  This means the mounter <em>knows</em> how to mount my drive, and is perfectly capable of doing it...  it's just refusing to do it itself.<br /><br />I just about threw my box out the window at that point.  How retarded is that?  Seriously.<br /><br />So I do what it says and manually mount the drive via the commandline.  It appears to work.  Until I try to copy files to the drive, at which point it informs me that I don't have permission to write to the drive.<br /><br />So I check permissions to make sure I can write to the drive.  All signs say I can, except I can't.<br /><br />I try logging in as root to copy files to the drive.  No luck.<br /><br />Finally I give up and ask my Linux-savvy friends on IRC.  After a few minutes of back and forth, doing various diagnostics, we discover that the drive is mounted as read only (so I guess the mounter told me how to mount it incorrectly).<br /><br />They walk me through the process of mounting it as read+write (which of course I have to do manually via the commandline).  Note that this process wasn't striaghtforward, as they had to find where the drive was being loaded, and we had to set up a folder to mount it to, figure out what filesystem to mount it as, etc.<br /><br />Finally we got it all working.  I checked the timestamps of my IRC logs to see how long it took from the time I asked for help, to the time where I got the drive working....<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">2 hours</span>.<br /><br />I'm not exaggerating.  And that's not even counting the time I spent on my own before I asked for help, which was at least another hour.  So 3 hours to plug in a USB drive and get it to work.<br /><br />Here's the kicker.... <em>THIS IS TYPICAL</em>.  This isn't a rare one-time occurance.  <em>Every time I need to do something new</em> on this machine, it takes <em>at least</em> an hour to figure out how to do it.<br /><br />Nothing is intuitive.<br /><br />Nothing is user friendly.<br /><br />Nothing is easy.<br /><br />This OS is the biggest joke I've ever seen.<br /><br /><br />Oh, also, I still have to manually mount (and unmount) the drive whenever I need to use it on this computer.  I have a system set up where it's easier to do now.. and it only takes a few seconds... but it still isn't as simple as "plug in the drive and use it"<br /><br />-------------------<br /><strong>Linux is not nearly as stable as everyone claims</strong><br /><br />The OS is pretty solid, yes, but the again so is Windows.  Windows isn't the cause of crashes on Windows, it's the <em>programs that you run</em> that cause the machine to screw up.<br /><br />Linux has all the same problems.  Linux itself is pretty solid.  But the programs you run have just as many bugs and problems as any Windows program.<br /><br />I tried out KDE for a bit.  Tons of visual glitches, and crashes every half hour.<br /><br />If a game or emu or something has a problem when in fullscreen, your resolution gets hosed.  I've had this happen to me a few times and the only way I can fix it is to log out and log back in.<br /><br />-----------------------------<br /><br />So yeah.  Those are my tales.<br /><br />I heard nothing but good things about Ubuntu, as well.  And I was optimistic and really wanted to like it when I tried it out.<br /><br />But now I'm just fed up with it.  I'll leave it on this box for cross-platform compilation pursposes, but the next box I get I'll be switching to Windows and will never look back.<br /><br /><br />Know what you're getting into.  I can tell you this (and this has even been confirmed by some people I know that like Linux.. so this isn't one-sided):<br /><br />- You <strong>will</strong> need to spend a lot of time figuring things out.  Even on "user friendly" distros like Ubuntu<br />- You <strong>will</strong> need to read pages and pages of documentation and man pages to learn how to do things.<br />- You <strong>will</strong> need to use the commandline regularly (I try my best to avoid it wherever possible, but I still have to use it sometimes)<br /><br /><br />As far as I can tell... the people that like Linux are people that like to solve computer puzzles and tinker around with their machine.<br /><br />So if you like to do that, then you might have fun on Linux.<br /><br />But if you want your computer to "just work"... then <em>STAY AWAY</em>.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I really want to do something like a emulator like this but there aren't any good examples on how opcodes are figured out by the values of the numbers, atleast in my research :(</div>

<br />This is true, except very long ago with Windows 95 and 98 which used to crash all by themselves. This has been long fixed in all Windows NT series, and now Windows 7 is very fast and actually still boots and shuts down faster than linux on my PC (even tough I've had it for 8 months).
<br />
<br />A program crashing under older Windows (95, 98, NT4, etc...) used to be really badly handled by the OS and had many chances to crash the whole system. A program crashing on Windows 2000 or XP used to cause some trouble (serious lagging until you can open the task manager and kill it), sometimes the computer would freeze if you weren't lucky, but most of the time it was ok.
<br />I don't know if it's Windows 7 or my Dual Core CPU (the fact that if one program is taking one core and crashing, the OS can kill it form the other core) or both, but now if a program crash Windows detect it immediately and kill it automatically without any lag or anything. I see blue screens when booting Windows once in a while (fails to boot), and it's a big mystery to me, but other than that I'm fully satisfied with Windows 7.
<br />
<br />What is good with Ubuntu is that it's really damn easy to install on a computer (although getting it to work alongside with Windows is a bit more complicated) and that it does a lot of things automatically like detect hardware and install programs. The bad things is that if something is not done automatically, you will have a VERY HARD time doing it manually, especially if you're not a professional computer scientist (someone who isn't skilled/knowledgeable with computers can just forget it).
<br />
<br />Linux is good for geeks computer scientists. Mac is good for fashion victims who have money to waste. Windows is good for everyone else. This is the way I see things I know not everyone will agree. To be honest I like the fact that Linux is 100% free and open source, but that don't make it the best OS ever.

<br />Okay, okay.  I get your point.
<br />
<br />[s]
<br />But honestly... are you really going to tell me that anyone can just pick up and use Ubuntu?  Because that's crap and you know it.
<br />
<br />Most people <em>can</em> just pick up and use Windows, without ever having used it before.  Children, for example.  You can sit a 6 year old in front a computer, spend 5 minute showing them the basics, and inside a week they'll have figured it out enough to do almost anything they want.
<br />
<br />Try that with a Linux box.
<br />[/s]
<br />
<br />EDIT:  On second thought... if someone sets up an Ubuntu box and gets everything working, <em>then</em> introduces the child to it, then yeah they would be able to figure it out.
<br />
<br />So my retort here was poor / incorrect.
<br />
<br />Touche on this point.  I'll concede it for now.
<br />
<br />EDIT2:  no strikeout tags?  lame

It's more like you have to work for it, rather than it working for you.  I guess that's fun for a lot of hobbyists, but it brings me back to my original point:  it's not an OS that "just works".  Every little thing takes finnagling.<br /><br />So if you like playing around and exploring your OS and learning all sorts of cool commanlind jargon, you might have a lot of fun with Linux.<br /><br />Personally, I hate that crap.  My computer is a tool.  I mean to use it.

<br />
<br />I've tried out AndLinux, basically "Linux For Windows".  It's a distribution of CoLinux that somewhat works out of the box.  (Only thing really broken out of the box is Unicode support for accessing the C drive).
<br />You get a GUI, and can run some KDE applications, like Konqueror, and also can run the Synaptic package manager to get packages from Ubuntu.
<br />You can even run Wine.
<br />Only problem is that the Windows side and Linux side don't like talking to each other, and can only communicate through a virtual network card.  X is super-super slow.  Also, installed applications aren't added to any menus anywhere, so you need to run them from a terminal.

<br />Windows XP, the 32-bit version of Windows Vista, and the 32-bit version of Windows 7 will load drivers without a verifiable Authenticode digital signature. The 64-bit version of Windows Vista and the 64-bit version of Windows 7 will not. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=windows+kernel+mode+code+signing" class="postlink">Google explains</a>.
<br />
<br />If you don't have a copy of Windows, then where did you buy your computer?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have quite a bit of dislike for Linux.  Admittedly I haven't used it that much, partly because I dislike it, for many of the same reasons that Disch listed.
<br />
<br />I have quite a few friends and coworkers who use Linux and claim it's so awesome, and I have to switch to it.  They keep trying to entice me to use it, so I periodically get demonstrations of all of its awesome features.  Almost invariably, they'll call me over and say "watch this," click into whatever they're showing me, and say "wait, it's not working like it should."  Then they proceed to tweak some settings, check dependencies or recompile software.  More than half the time they will eventually be able to get it to work...and more than half the time it turns out they were just showing me it's <em>as good as</em> Windows, not offering anything new or exciting.  In fact, they're most often excited to show me how they got something to work in Wine.
<br />
<br />It really doesn't seem to be worth my time to invest in it.  I would gladly pay $100 rather than spend 100 cumulative hours of reading documentation or recompiling.
<br />
<br />And judging by a lot of the sites I visit, I'm glad to see that most of the internet has woken up to this too.  I remember how anti-Windows the discussion tended to turn back in the day (which was probably justified, given the state of the OS back at the start of the internet).  Nowadays, I see a lot more people with the same viewpoint as me: Windows just works, and Linux probably isn't worth the headache for most people.

<br />How much time are you willing to spend on the phone with a Microsoft representative in India to get activation status straightened out after you have added hardware to your PC?

<br />None, because I have never had to deal with this situation.  I've added lots of hardware over the years and never had "activiation status" issues.
<br />
<br />And if my options consist of having to tell someone my product key and being on my way after a few minutes, versus hardware simply not working with no indication why and being unable to find drivers or competent help on the internet, I would take the first option.
