<br />
<br />My personal preference is that in the hands of an AAA musician, SNES sound &gt; MD sound but I think both sound fantastic when properly applied.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUwg-n1GgOo" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUwg-n1GgOo</a>
<br />I wouldn't mind hearing that out of an MD port.  I like the SNES one a little better (trumpets+'capcom guitar' are cool =)) but the MD take on it is really decent.
<br />
<br />I have an easier time dealing with shitty SNES audio than I do with shitty MD audio though.  The latter is so much nastier IMHO.

<br />Having to spend memory for samples takes away from making your RPG longer, and copying samples into SPC memory results in those two-second freezes (MARIO START!) common to Super NES games. Nintendo also charged more for memory than Sega did; the Super NES version of Shaq-Fu (not that it was a good game, but bear with me) had a limited character roster for just this reason.

<br />
<br /> I'm all for getting the facts straight, but the Genesis was a <em>damn</em> fine system (more memorable to me than the SNES, despite having some fun with SNES RPGs). I can understand that some dislike that FM sound, and that mentality was heavier back in the day when FM was sounding tired and old, and the SNES was something new/different/exciting. But this day and age? I love all those classic sounds/musics. From nes to md to even snes. And there are some really incredible sound tracks of Genesis games that break away from that normal/traditional FM sound. I was grinding through Phantasy Star 2 on the 360 the other day, loving that old familiar/traditional FM sound track. Love that RPG, even if it is a grind fest (worst than DQ 1).

<br />And this is part of the problem. With the SNES you have the nostalgia factor, you are not only listening to the music, you recognize the tunes and have fond memories of them, while you have never played a Genesis game for more than a few minutes in your life and are only analyzing them in a rushed, purely technical way.
<br />
<br />If you don't like how the MD sounds, there is nothing I can do to change your mind, but what I simply don't understand is how you can say that the SNES sounds perfect, when a lot of the games sound like you have your head stuck into a bucket. So the only conclusion I can get to is that you end up ignoring the flaws of the SNES because of your love for the games. And if you are never really gonna experiment (i.e. play for more than a few minutes) some good games on the MD (which exist for sure, or the system wouldn't have lived for so long), that's something you are never gonna have with it.
<br />
<br />To be perfectly honest, I think all of these old consoles sound bad from a technical point of view (the NES can be ear-bleeding bad in a lot of games, much more so than the MD), but I'm willing to look (or hear) past that if the melodies are good. To me the melodies are much more important than the instruments that are playing them.

<br />To be honest CV Bloodline's music, while not horrible or anything, is really so-so. I know the game is very good as I played it under emulation - but the music isn't a prime example of what the MD can do (especially compared to what other people posted here).
<br />The Stage 2 sound better remixed in Circle of the Moon BTW.
<br />
<br />And, folks, I'm sorry for "Bashing" your beloved MD or anyhting. It's just that this is a Nintendo forum - and a lot of guys keeps denying the obvious that the MD is <em>technically</em> much more limited than the SNES. That doesn't mean all MD games are bad - nor that all SNES are great or anything like that. It's just the people should admit the obvious - FM sound can do great things, people posted links to proof that and they were very interesting to listen, but most games used it poorly or even horriby. If I want to compose a MD song, I know it will be a total headache to make it sound good you have to know some math formulas etc... - while on the SNES all it takes is to pick up my favourite insturments and convert them to BRR (as long as it don't exceed some RAM limit).
<br />
<br />(And BTW FM soud theoretically should brig me nostalgia of my old PC. However it doesn't really I'm glad not to have to suffer this any longer. The GM instruments sounded especially bad on it.)

<br />
<br />I boost freqs above 8KHz at least 12db, to get really crisp and bright sound, and the point of my sound mods are to lift up the lowpass filter points above hearing rane so that the high freq content comes through... I really hate how SNEs just is unable to represent things above 12ish KHz well (the sample rate allows for 16KHz, but the interpolation and DSP filter kills a big chunk of it)... SNES sounds so damn bad because of it, like a shitty AM radio, while MD is studio grade equipment / high end HiFi on that regard.
