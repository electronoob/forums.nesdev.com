		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks! It seems to run a *bit* better for me...sorta. When I first tried it, it got (on the "real" dump or whatever) to the frozen gameplay screen I mentioned happening with some dumps earlier. This happened the first two times I tried it, but lately it's just been doing the same thing it did before. I tried to capture the frozen gameplay screen, but I haven't been able to get it to reappear so far. It still has saving issues with Lutter and Puzzle Boys.
<br />
<br />Just for the hell of it, I've posted some videos of various issues I've had with my Powerpak I haven't seen reported elsewhere, in case it's somehow related. Aside from these, the only issues mine has (that I'm aware of) are "jumpy" statusbars (or whatever) in SMB3/Megaman 3/TMNT2 (these randomly appear, and usually go away if I restart the game after having the Powerpak on for a while).
<br />
<br />Metroid FDS:

<br />Lutter (JPN):

<br />
<br />-Weird blue noise on the screen just before it freezes while saving. Same dump works fine in Nestopia.
<br />
<br />Kirby's Adventure:

<br />
<br />-Various palette issues (seems to replace certain colors with white sometimes). Took me forever to make it happen ingame.
<br />
<br />Noah's Ark (PAL):
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0KzyIgVvss">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0KzyIgVvss</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />-Ingame horizontal lines similar to what happened for me in early versions of the VRC6 mapper. (Running on NTSC NES)
<br />
<br />I'm not complaining about these, just posting in case it helps <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />EDIT: Also, in the Earthbound prototype, 16x32 pixel (horizontal) artifacts appear on screen when you bring up the Talk/Goods/etc menu. They seem to appear in fixed locations, like once per screen or something. These artifacts do affect scenery, and they can make previously passable areas unpassable (and the other way around). I dunno if it makes the game unbeatable or anything though, it's actually not very annoying.

<br />
<br />Yep, I checked the checksum of F.MAP on my Powerpak and the one currently on loopy's site, they're identical. Guess I'll reformat my CF card just to make sure that's not the prob, I'll post back here in the unlikely event that it is.

<br />
<br />hell no. just like thier Mega Drive flash cart (which hasn't seen the light of day after litterally years since it's anouncement), the Neo Flash NES flash cart has had no real updates beyond some pics. Dr Neo hasn't released an ETA on this thing or any of the other supposed projects in development. All they care about is their MANY Nintendo DS flash carts, it seems. 
<br />
<br />I would just try to score a Power Pak if I were you and not hold your breath for a Neo Flash NES/Famicom product. Too bad, because I have their PC Engine flash cart and I love it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry for ressurecting an old post, but of all the games I have tried, Metroid refuses to work for me.  I have used mappers from 1.20 to 1.35b2, including loopy's latest mappers, every .fds of Metroid I can find, a front loading NES and Famicom AV.  My PowerPak was truly a first run cartridge but has bootrom 1.11 and bunnyboy implemented the resistor fix.  Neither console was modified except to enable external audio.  <br /><br />The result is pretty much as MrPlacard describes : <div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The above mentioned dump of the FDS version of Metroid doesn't (playably) work for me, using the latest FDS mapper (the one with FDS sound). It gets all the way to the name entry screen, but when you try to start a game it says &quot;omachi kudasai&quot; in hiragana (light blue text), followed by a grey screen with white text saying something about BCRS (&quot;BCRS yuyotsu&quot; (yuyo is lowercase katakana, is it garbage?) or something) and some katakana (&quot;set B side&quot; or something), then the BCRS/katakana text glitches/turns light blue(black background) for a second before jumping to a black screen. Resetting at this point gives a glitched FDS BIOS followed by a glitched &quot;Family Computer&quot; screen (halfway down the screen, doesn't scroll up) (glitched BIOS screen remains visible), but the game seems to start as before after that. <br /><br />(with some dumps of Metroid I can get all the way to the first screen with some finagling, but the level is horribly glitched and Samus and the enemies can't move) </div><br /><br />I have attached a photo of the screen showing what happens at absolute best, the first Brinstar screen is shown but Samus cannot move due to the overlayed blocks.  Can anyone offer a solution?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Because FDS media is writable, there needs to be some defined way to hash .fds files to make sure the read-only portion is correct. Fortunately, as I understand it, all read-only files precede writable files. With ROMs, it's easier because the entire PRG and CHR can have CRC, MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256 applied to it. So has the emulation community settled on a way to &quot;normalize&quot; FDS dumps to something hashable?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The only way to do that is to take verified clean disk dumps, directly from sealed fds boxes and hash once the file header is added.  In my opinion, the fds file header is useless, a check of the file size should tell you how many shoes the disk has.  Since there was no standard way to write save data to disk, the best way to reflect disk writes is to use something like an ips file that keeps track of the bytes changed.  Nintendulator does that.  The fds files I tried were not clean, but they worked in that emulator.  <br /><br />Some games like The Legend of Zelda write to the disk once you delete a character file.  They can look clean.  Other games like Metroid do not write to the disk until you start a game, and therefore cannot look clean by playing the game itself.   One solution would be to delete all three characters, then do file comparisons after you begin a new game in slot one, then two and three.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Keep in mind that the FDS can (should, actually) only write a very specific area of the disk. If Nintendo put hardware on some of the units to make sure they could write only at the end of the discs, you could use that information as reference and hash only the pertinent part of the disk.<br /><br />I HONESTLY believe that EMULATOR or GAME COPIER HEADERS should NOT be into the hashes for ROM files as they're NOT part of the games in question. Maybe it would be PERFECT if ROM management utilities would INTERPRET the actual EMULATOR/COPIER HEADERS and hash the real contents of the files then correct any wrong HEADERS as needed.
