What I did is take a 256kbit sram and dropped it in place of the 64Kbit sram that had been in there, lifted the legs up on A13 and A14 and jumpered those manually to rom A13-14. Now, the game boots and plays properly on my FCTwin but it won't save ...and it crashes after selecting a new game on my SNES 1 and jr. <br /><br />I have tested it on my Powerpak, and it works properly on there. So, is there something else that has to be done to get the larger SRAM to work on a standard 64k cart aside from jumping the extra 2 address lines?

I have<br />some NBA TE carts that would be alot more useful if I could add more<br />ram to them. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
