		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Was tinkering with the idea of getting into some NES game programming, but do not know where to start.  I am a moderately experienced programmer with some game programming experience, but starting from scratch here.  Any thoughts on where I should start?  Is there a super beginners guide out there?
<br />
<br />Also, if you see a recreation of a photo in NES style graphics, is there some sort of program that does that conversion, or did someone actually "paint" it by hand?
<br />
<br />Thanks a bunch!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1. Have you programmed in 6502 assembly before? If you haven't, go check out the main site (nesdev.com) and look at the stuff under "6502." Also check out 6502.org. Supposedly Assembly In One Step is the best place to get started with 6502 ASM. You'll also want to download the 6502 opcodes list off of 6502.org on your hard drive, as it's a helpful reference.
<br />
<br />2. NES-specific tutorials are also available on the main page under "NES" (I think). "NES 101" is widely considered to be the best, but "Programming that 8-bit beast of power, the NES" is good also. NesTech.doc is one of the better hardware guides out there, but a few minor parts are inaccurate.
<br />
<br />3. You'll need an assembler to compile your code and an emulator to test it (unless you want to make your own cartridges). The two big assemblers used are NESASM and C65. Each have their advantages and disadvantages. As far as emulators go, FCEUXD SP is the best for debugging, as it has lots of options, but it's not entirely accurate. Nestopia and Nintendulator are supposedly the most accurate, with slight differences between them. Download all three and see which works best for you.
<br />
<br />4. Some NES developers probably made in-house tools to do photo-to-NES conversion. However, mostly hand-drawn art was used on the NES, because the NES has a small palette. You'll find out more of what I mean when you look at the guides. What prompted you to ask this?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks so much!  This is exactly the kind of info I am looking for!   I just remember some NES games back in the day, especially ones based on a movie/tv show, that had screen shots, but in NES graphic form.  Always wondered if they were hand-drawn or if the screen shot was converted by some sort of program.
