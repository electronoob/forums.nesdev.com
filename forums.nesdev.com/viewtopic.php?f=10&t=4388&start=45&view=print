<br />
<br />And this game <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=1531" class="postlink">http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=1531</a>   comes in a big purple famicom case but it is a MMC1.  So I think it's better to know the cart before buying it.  I bought this one out of the current theory but it failed <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> But that's ok, at the price I paid and since I didn't have it, I don't mind much.  
<br />
<br />Now, after reading back the specs, it's a MMC1 with CHR-RAM. hmmmm.. Maybe this cart is useful after all.  How useful is an MMC1 + VRAM?

<br />
<br />MMC1 w/ CHR RAM is very common, but in this case the board SUROM is very rare. It will give you access to 512K of PRG ROM, but only through convoluted bankswitching so it's probably not in any way preferrable to MMC3 unless you need one-screen mirroring.
<br />
<br />Personally I think you should just get a PowerPak, this talk of butchering carts is making me sad :(

<br />
<br />Of course I would prefer not to have to destroy carts, I don't enjoy that.  But I cannot use easily a PowerPak on my famicom unless I get some kind of fancy adapter.
<br />
<br />So I have the following possibilities:
<br />
<br />- Get that apdater + powerPak : easily 200$
<br />- Get back a nes + step-up converter (I'm in japan) + powerpak: easily more than 200$ 
<br />- Get an unknown famicom cart, rotting up in junk pile that contains the mapper I want: 1$ (+ possible eeprom burner if I can't borrow one)
<br />
<br />So my choice is more money based. And can you really get a PowerPak these days? They are hard to find you know.
<br />
<br />What makes me more sad is to think about those junk carts I see in a box that nobody use and that could end up in a garbage truck someday.  Ending up as a dev cart is a better fate then been destroyed completely.

<br />
<br />They beat the MMC3 because you can support more SRAM, more PRG bankswitching shemes, 1-screen mirroring and have CHRRAM (well MMC3 can also have CHRRAM and 1-screen mirroring but those carts are rare and you need to modify more common carts to get them).

<br />
<br />NES to Famicom Converters are easy to find and cheap. They are included with alot of Famiclones. The PowerPAK is not available at the moment but if you keep checking Retrousb.com it will eventually come back into stock. If you are going to butcher a cartridge you should choose it wisely. Something common and yet shitty is a good idea.

<br />I really don't think butchering a cart is as bad as some of you make it to be. What's the difference if a cart is in a collector's shelf or helping someone in developing their game? Games are software, not hardware. You can always keep a copy of the original game data and play it in your devcart when you feel like it, the software remains intact. The only exception are the contents of WRAM in battery-backed games, I'll give you that. Still, batteries eventually die and the games would be lost anyway unless you have a way to backup that data, in which case using the same board for different games wouldn't be a problem in the first place.

Parts wear out, game shops trash their bins of old games, supply gradually dwindles. Butchering carts only serves to accelerate the process.

I'm still not sure which one I will use, still investigating it. This thread was mostly for investigation.  I don't know yet if I will use MMC5 or not.  The reason I mostly asked the question is because I found some very cheap MMC5 carts, so I was curious about the specs. 2 days ago I found more MMC5 carts (the mahjong one) for a few hundred yen again so I may skip butchering Just breed after all.  If I can avoid to butcher them, even better.  I don't like to break carts, I'm a collector too and own plenty of them.<br /><br />edit:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">BMF54123 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A lot of people collect games just as much for the hardware as the software (I have a prototype Famicom cart that I would never part with, even though I've dumped the ROM). </div><br /><br />If you decide to use a prototype for dev use, I would slap you silly <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> This is too rare compare to common cart that I could use as a dev cart. <br /><br /><br />It may be not common from an american perspective (I was not living in japan before you know), but for me, so many carts are available in that junk bin so why not.

<br />Yes, I would love that too. But I never had the chance to test one so I don't know how well it would do the job for me yet.
