If you're trying to simulate reset conditions, don't forget to restore the SPC-700 to its boot ROM loader, which will be difficult if unknown code is already running on it. I ran into this problem with my SPC player; I had to reset my SNES manually in order to get the SPC-700 into a known state.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I am just playing around with neviksti's Game Doctor SF7 exploit, which lets you access the SF7's full memory map and BIOS.  Hence you can write code for the parallel port and DRAM.  I realized that when I reset the SNES, it returns to the SF7 menu.  So basically I make code changes in a text editor then save them and run a script that builds the ROM and sends it over the parallel port to my SF7.
<br />
<br />It would really speed up the process if I could reset my SNES remotely, i.e. via the parallel port or via a controller combination.  This would make iterative development allot nicer.  I think that I could stuff a parallel port or controller check at the very beginning of the NMI handler, so that even if my program gets stuck in an infinite loop, it can still be remotely reset.
<br />
<br />Also, I don't think that the sound processor's state will matter.  I don't think the SF7 uses it at all.

<br />
<br />Yeah, jumping to the reset location should be ok.  Or JMP ($FFFC) if you don't know the exact location.  It won't be exactly the same as a hardware reset though, but should be close enough.

<br />Yeah, but that is allot harder.  It'd be much easier to just make use of the SF7's ability to load a ROM over the parallel port.  All I need to be able to do is jump the the SF7's reset handler.  Does anybody know where it is located?

<br />yeah maybe it is =/
<br />I did however do something similar for the APU on the snes (but that is ofcourse not the same thing <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> )
<br />
<br />
<br />maybe a bit OT..
<br />Is there some similar exploit for the Super Wildcard (DX2)?

<br />
<br />I'd like to know too.  It would be nice to play around with the DX2's memory map too.  The SF7 magic "C0" byte is the easiest way to play around with the SF7's memory map, even easier than the exploit.  I wouldn't be surprised if the DX2 also has a similar feature.  Also, has the DX2's BIOS been disassembled?  Has its memory map been documented?
<br />
<br />I have a few gadgets that I want to make work with the SF7.  Basically parallel port IDE devices that use the kingbyte chipset.  Having disassembled DX2 BIOS code would help, as it already supports the kingbyte chipset, as that is what is used in the Diskdual... and many other devices.  An interesting thing to hack on the DX2 would be to make it support a harddrive on both master and slave IDE buses, as opposed to requiring the slave device to be a CDROM drive.

<br />
<br />You don't need to enable emulation mode, but yes, it "look" just like a manually-initiated reset.  Keyword: RESET.
<br />
<br />It will *NOT* act identical to that of a manually-initiated power-on.  :-)
