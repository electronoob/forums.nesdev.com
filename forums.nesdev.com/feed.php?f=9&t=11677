You'll need to cut the jumper and replace it with a resistor in order to get audio mixed in from the NES side.<br />The simplest mixing circuit was that used by the N163-using boards: it was just a 5-20kΩ resistor from AUDIO FROM 2A03 to AUDIO TO RF, with the output from the 163 connected to AUDIO TO RF. Drilling a little hole and adding a potentiometer would be a reasonable thing to do.<br /><br />The <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/File:MMC5_audio.png" class="postlink">MMC5</a> and <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=101695#p101695" class="postlink">SS5B</a> both used a very similar and more complicated circuit.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Tue Sep 30, 2014 12:50 pm</p><hr />

The Famicom has a rather different audio circuit. The 2A03 audio goes in through one pin, and the cartridge is responsible for mixing it before sending it out the other pin. As you noticed, most cartridges just bridge those two pins to pass the 2A03 audio straight through.<br /><br />If you want to mix two sources you'll need to balance them somehow. Different cartridges do this in different ways, usually with resistors, sometimes with an additional amplifier. On the usual NES audio mod, the expansion audio gets a ~45k resistor where it combines with the 2A03 output, right? I don't know whether that would work well with the Famicom, but I'd suggest trying a potentiometer and adjust it until it sounds right to you.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Tue Sep 30, 2014 10:24 am</p><hr />

Hey guys, I recently purchased a yobo 72 pin to 60 pin converter from Stone Age Gamer and I noticed it cuts out the expansion sound with my Gimmick! reproduction and my NES Everdrive N8. I used the NESdev wiki to figure out that I needed to connect NES PIN 54 to Famicom PIN 46. I noticed Famicom pins 45 and 46 were bridged, but I didn't think that would effect anything...<br /><br />I can *slightly* hear the expansion sound but the volume is much too low, to the point of barely being perceptible, vs my sound modded control deck NES which sounds vibrant and clear. I took some pictures of my awful soldering in hope that you might have some pointers for me <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Buying a new adapter is not out of the question.. this one is kinda beat up.<br /><br />A big issue was that there's almost no room on the pin, in fact, now i'm a bit worried about plugging this cartridge converter in because I don't want it to bend my Famicom's pins.. I was very gentle pushing the cartridge converter in for the initial test and I haven't plugged it in since.<br /><br />Any help is definitely appreciated, whether a link to an adapter I can buy that already has this functionality, tips, anything.<br /><br /><a href="http://imgur.com/4sRCCSc,lrShp03,AROrK40" class="postlink">http://imgur.com/4sRCCSc,lrShp03,AROrK40</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6708">MP2E</a> — Tue Sep 30, 2014 12:56 am</p><hr />
