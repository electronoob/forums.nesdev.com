On the other hand, I might just spring the game on the community unawares. We'll see  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

Enjoy the video.

Definitely Addam's Family for Gameboy.  Especially with the throwing swords, jumping on windowsills, running around in the woods, annoying bats and all.  One of my old favorites for sure.  Although I'm guessing it wasn't a motivator for this at all, just coincidence.  Anyways it looks great, looking forward to seeing/playing more!

<br />On technical side, game looks super solid!
<br />Visuals are not awesome, but I like them. They are giving me strange, yet good feeling.It feels like a distant past, old games I was playing when still child.
<br />I liked music from video, good job.
<br />I can guess that you can have several powerups? Propably only 1 at time?
<br />From what I can gather, game is rather easy?

<br />How many people is in your team?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Awesome! Few people here get very far with their projects, so you get points just by being where you are now. I must also congratulate you for going way beyond the commonplace and making something way more interesting and advanced than the typical single-screen game.
<br />
<br />There are some things I didn't like though... mostly the stiffness of the main character (both in physics and graphics), the abundance of black backgrounds and some of the graphics. I strongly believe that if you got another artist to touch up the graphics a bit the game would look much better.
<br />
<br />Other than that I liked everything: the music, the enemies and the pace of the action. Congratulations.

The video appears to have been clipped to lines 8 to 231, and the floor still looks dangerously low for a game with bottomless pits. To make absolutely sure that everything is visible, I'd recommend moving everything up by one tile. You can do this by setting the Y scroll position to 8 and moving sprites to compensate.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the tips and kind remarks, I appreciate it. As for cart release, I would definitely like to, but it seems the scene definitely has a lot more developers than cart producers in recent months. It may be a (free) ROM release. We do intend to design box art and manual PDFs though that would go with it, so people would have the option of having a repro produced for themselves individually.
<br />
<br />As for a new camera system, or any type of change that could induce unforeseen consequences in the rest of the engine, this sort of thing will have to wait for a future game. Nomolos is our first game, hopefully not our last!
