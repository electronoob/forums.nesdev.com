In my music engine, all drums go through the sound effects engine. The kick drum in the opening to <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=84524#84524" class="postlink">Zap Ruder</a>, for example, is one sound effect played on the triangle channel and another sound effect on the noise channel.

It is not that noticeable or bad if pitch of the drum vary a bit.<br /><br />I don't think that fast pitch drop that is required for a drum could sound too melodic to create any problem for listener. Any real drums (rock drumkit, for example) has own tuning and need to be tuned just like any other musical instrument, but it does not create any problem, you'll never say that kick or snare (they are tuned as well) are 'melodic'.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Wed Nov 23, 2011 12:05 pm</p><hr />

Yeah I always throught it would be complicated to do this.<br />The way Alberto did it is probably fine but it's a problem the triangle drum(s) is/are "hard-wired" in the sound engine and can't be changed as the user wishes.<br /><br />Arpegio would be fine, but it becomes a major problem if you need one arpeggio setting for every different note you use.<br /><br />So yeah I think the "fixed note" in arpeggio mode is probably the best - but what about if you want a pitch that doesn't fall in a note but in between (to avoid the listener thinking the drums are actually melodic) ?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Nov 23, 2011 11:36 am</p><hr />

Why would you want this, especially with these weird tempos? It is very easy to make triangle drums in Famitracker with the arpeggio sequence, the only problem is that you either have to make a drum instrument for every bass note, or just accept that drum pitch is changes along with notes.<br /><br />jsr was asked long ago for a 'fixed note' feature in the arpeggio sequences, this would make things like these much easier to handle, and he even implemented it in a WIP back then, but it was never included into any release.

Ah. I ask because I've been recently listening to Fumito Tamayama's work on NES (and David Whittaker) and Fumito uses triangle drums. I can do covers of his work on Famitracker but I have to write at a really fast tempo (300, 256, 225, etc.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4429">Doommaster1994</a> — Wed Nov 23, 2011 11:13 am</p><hr />

The technique for programming drums using the triangle channel is very simple.<br /><br />You use the triangle channel for very few frames (1 to 4, depending on the sound) with carefully chosen frequencies for each frame, along with the noise channel using also carefully chosen frequencies and volumes from a table.<br /><br />The drum sounds take over the triangle channel temporally, cutting the sound of other parts (the bass line for example). That's why they use the channel only for very few frames. Also, if the drums sound loud enough the take over is a bit less noticeable.<br /><br />I remember to have spent a lot, and I really mean A LOT of time tuning the tables of the drums until they sounded good enough (for my taste).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4722">AlbertoG</a> — Wed Nov 23, 2011 10:07 am</p><hr />

Yes, I'm reffering to rows in a tracker. Usually it is 2-8 frames per row. 6 is default by tradition, it is 125 BPM for PAL. Usually it is 16-32 rows per measure, depending from the minimal note length you want to have.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Fri Nov 18, 2011 12:28 pm</p><hr />

By "row" you mean a row in a tracker ? I never used trackers much and I don't like this format to compose music... I just use my own format which is more like MML.<br />But I guess a row in a tracker is like a tick in my engine exept you use less rows, usually 8 (??) for a whole note, when I use 24 ticks in my engine making it more precise.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Nov 18, 2011 11:04 am</p><hr />
