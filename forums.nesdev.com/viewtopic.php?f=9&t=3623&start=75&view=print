		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm led to believe there's a number of FOACs out there, as I and a few friends have various systems obtained in Japan, Russia, Estonia, Mexico, etc. (most of which were still made in China/HK/etc.) and all of them have dramatically different behavior. While I've not subjected them to rigorous compatibility comparisons, I do know that:
<br />
<br />#1: Some FOACs will run games others will not.
<br />
<br />#2: Audio reproduction, while imperfect on all FOACs, is significantly different depending on which one you're using. While many inconsistencies like certain waveforms/DPCM being louder than others could likely be narrowed down to PCB design problems outside the FOAC (like unevenly amplifying the two audio lines from the Faux-2A03) issues such as inconsistent pulse width from the two pulse generators indicate variations in FOAC design or manufacturing.
<br />
<br />#3: This is the strangest one; different FOACs I own perform with different levels of CPU performance. As an example, I have a "Famulator" and "Neo Fami", both of which have similar-sounding triangle/DPCM reproduction but differing quality pulse/noise quality. But the odd thing is that the Neo Fami exhibits horrible slowdown (twice as bad, or more, than the real FC/NES) in numerous games, such as Kirby's Adventure; while the Famulator's CPU performance is just slightly below that of the real FC/NES. I'm investigating why this is-- but so far, the results are consistent with operation of the genuine 2A03 at different frequencies, with the exception that audio pitch is unaltered.
<br />
<br />#4: I've seen a datasheet for a FOAC that listed it as an 'educational' computer processor and made no mention of FC compatibility, and that its ability to draw sprites were for 'cartoons'. I don't doubt there are a number of chips like this from various manufacturers, probably all slightly different variations on an original clone that was reverse engineered.
<br />
<br />Just some observances.
