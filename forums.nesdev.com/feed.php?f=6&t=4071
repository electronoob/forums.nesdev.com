I've implemented the 8.8 approach, works rather nicely, though it certainly isn't fast. I think the cycle count came out to something around 200-300ish per channel you're doing it to, on top of any other work you might be doing.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8">ReaperSMS</a> — Fri Apr 25, 2008 4:17 pm</p><hr />

Mulitply and divide is VERY EASY to do in assembly, all it requires it writing a VERY SIMPLE loop that shifts and conditionally add/substract numbers. But this isn't the point here.<br /><br />Since note frequencies are exponential, if you just modify the pitch registers linearly, as shown on the code the other guy posted, it will sound fine, but the slide won't sound linear, it will sound exponential (growing slow down and fast up) because of the exponential nature of the period you control. However, if you write the registers logarithmically, it will compensate the exponential frequency, and sound linear. Some other hardware, like the SNES, gives control over pitch instead of period, so it's the other way arround. To clear it up, if you increase the pitch linearly on the following system :<br />- Period control (NES, etc...) : First going slow then going fast<br />- Note control (MIDI syntetisers, ...) : Going up at a constant speed<br />- Frequency control (SNES, ....) : First going fast then going slow<br /><br />Computing exponential values isn't exactly trival in assembly (at least not without floating point or tables), but it's easy to pass trough a recursive procedure that will have an exponential result : Take a number and add/substract one faction of itself regularly, then it will grow/decrease exponentially. For exemple if you take the pitch, shift it right 4 times and add it to itself, the result is a multiply by 17/16, and a recursive multiply by 17/16 is expoential base 17/16. This is basically how hardware sweep works on the NES.<br /><br />Another solution (that I've used) is to simply make your sound routine with  note control (and fractional note controls) and then convert pitch from note to period using an logarithmic period table for each note fraction (you only need to do an octave, and can do the others with shifts).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Apr 25, 2008 12:32 pm</p><hr />

I could easily do this in my newest sound engine, which allows me to distort each pitch value by x/32 of a note. I would have to pre-define the note envelope that distorts the note to sweep up to the desired note, though. I suppose I could someday add a routine that will calculate this in real-time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Fri Apr 25, 2008 12:14 pm</p><hr />

So, first, to make sure we're talking about the same thing -- in tracked music, portamento is the process of sliding to a note from whereever we are. <br /><br />In MODs, there are two kinds of portamento, depending on hardware capabilities -- impulse tracker calls them "amiga" and "linear" slides. Despite the name, the linear slides aren't linear (they're exponential).<br /><br />So-called "amiga slides", used by Screamtracker 3, Fasttracker 2, and all the original trackers for the Amiga, adjust the period (1/frequency) by X per time interval, until it's arrived at the desired note. It happens to be the case that, in the middle of the range in tracked music (C2 in a MOD, C4 in ST3, C5 in impulse tracker), a speed of 0x10 corresponds to one half-step per time interval.  (However, an octave above, it's one whole step per time, and an octave below, it's one quarter step per time)<br /><br />The math for the Amiga slides is easy -- just something like<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">if &#40;target==current&#41; return;<br /><br />if &#40;target&lt;current&#41;<br /> if &#40;target&lt;current-speed&#41;<br />  current-=speed;<br /> else<br />  current=target;<br />else<br /> if &#40;target&gt;current+speed&#41;<br />  current+=speed;<br /> else<br />  current=target;<br /></div>and best off, it doesn't require multiply or divide which require  tricks or external hardware on the NES.<br /><br />"Linear slides", used by Impulse Tracker, guarantee this correlation over the entire range, so in an appropriately configured IT song, 0x10 is always one half step per time. They are also supported by MIDI and the NES's pitch slide hardware (albeit with a different conversion)<br /><br />The NES supports pitch slides on the square wave channels, <a href="http://nesdevwiki.org/index.php/APU_Sweep" class="postlink">http://nesdevwiki.org/index.php/APU_Sweep</a>.<br /><br />You could do something similar to what the NES does, like <div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">if &#40;!--cycle&#41; &#123;<br />  current = current - &#40;current&gt;&gt;amount&#41; + &#40;target&gt;&gt;amount&#41;;<br />  cycle=reloadvalue;<br />&#125;<br /></div> although this specific code would have problems with integer math, and the 6502 doesn't provide a particularly good way to do a variable shifts.<br /><br />Or you could instead store all your current state of pitch (as i briefly entertained but decided was overkill in the end) as 8.8 MIDI-style fixed point numbers (where 60.0=C4, 60.5 is halfway between C4 and C#4, &amp;c).
