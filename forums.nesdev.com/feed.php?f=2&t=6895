So, the datacasette samples use the $4016 address line (R1 and W0)?<br /><br />That's interesting... I would have thought that the audio line on the FC port would be used for part of it, but I haven't examined the signal paths on a FBKB yet. I guess that the KB converts that datacasette signals directly to $4016 reads and writes.<br /><br />I was pondering this when making my pinout charts, as the FC doesn't have audio in available on the EXP port, so I suspected that it went over either $4016 or $4017, but I thought that the FC uses the analogue audio data directly over pin 2 (NES EXP pin 21).<br /><br />If this is the case, I will have to add mini audio jack lines to the NESpander using this design as part of the final product., for those without the keyboard. Pretty easy to stick in the design somewhere...<br /><br />-Xious<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Mon Aug 30, 2010 3:54 am</p><hr />

If FLAC is big, uncompressed PCM is even bigger.

Look, all of these ideas suffer from a "bootstrapping" problem.  You'd need to burn ROMs or do hacking to FDS disks to get this BASIC running on a disk, so if you have such technology, why not just program stuff and burn ROMs directly?  Or even if Family BASIC can be put on an FDS disk (via hacking), then that means you're better off writing your own programs directly onto the disk rather than running it through BASIC.<br /><br />Alternatively, since Family BASIC uses the tape data recorder, why not just distribute BASIC creations as sound files over the internet?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=355">ccovell</a> — Wed Aug 25, 2010 4:42 am</p><hr />

It just occurred to me: It is also possible to update the FDS BIOS ROM to include Family BASIC, so that BASIC loads instantly instead of the normal 'insert disk' animation.<br /><br />I don't know that this would be any better than having it on disk, except that you could potentially do more with BASIC in ROM than on disk.<br /><br />I know that somebody put out a utility to save BASIC programmes to disk, but I have very little in the way of information on it. Have you ever heard about this kind of tool?<br /><br />If you do a memory dump of the NES once the BASIC programme is running, I think you could pretty much turn that into a ROM that anybody could run, which is one way to do this without all the hullabalou, but it wouldn't be as interesting as coding to disk directly. <br /><br />-Xious<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Tue Aug 24, 2010 9:11 pm</p><hr />

Not only do you have to write code to remap mapper writes to corresponding Doctor registers but you have to figure out how to stop the game and upload tons of CHR data to CHRRAM without breaking the program sync. IRQ effects will have to be removed or significantly hacked too. CHR-ROM bankswitching animation will also have to be removed unless you target your hack specifically for TGD6.<br />Back in the day I think they used a hardware in-circuit-emulator for the hacking.

The Family Basic RAM is exactly the same as other cart WRAM (though I think it's 2KiB). Basically all the Game Doctor does is map a few registers into unused space ($42xx-45xx depending on unit) and takes $8000-FFFF for its game. Everything else gets passed through including FDS adapter RAM at $6000-7FFF serving as the WRAM.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />This could all prove very interesting in making both disk or cartridge versions of Family BASIC programmes and turning cart games into FDS disk games or even Doctor Disk games.<br /></div><br />Noooooot reaaaaaallyyyy.... You're thinking too far into it XD You can't easily make your own self-contained games like *snap*. You'd have to hack Family BASIC and link it to your game. Even then you'd have a very limited and poorly performing game... If you want to develop using the FC for the development environment, it'd definitely be better to start from scratch.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />yes, I know that some of you think this is all pointless, but it is important: It would make it easy to write simple games and distribute them, as well as create interesting hacks or improvements of FDS titles, and possibly provide further insight into the FDS and mapper conversion.<br /></div>How would BASIC help you hack FDS games or RE FDS/mapper code? There are already disk editors (with disassembler) as well as character editors for FDS by the Japanese company I2.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The FB v3 cart is also battery-backed, and I wonder if the Doctor Disk port makes use of the FDS writing feature to auto-save the address range used for programmes.<br /></div><br />Everything is lost once you power off. FC copiers don't retain their saves at power off unless they have been modified to do so.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />As I said, just using it to learn how the Doctor Disk mapper conversions work would be a blessing.<br /></div><br />You mean just put NROM, CNROM UOROM &amp; GNROM on disk? It's very simple, just compare the disk image to the ROM, I figured it out before I could program a "Hello World"... Don't expect it to be easy to hack MMC1/MMC3 etc to Game Doctors though, that requires extensive reverse engineering of the game program and Doctor hardware. Not only do you have to write code to remap mapper writes to corresponding Doctor registers but you have to figure out how to stop the game and upload tons of CHR data to CHRRAM without breaking the program sync. IRQ effects will have to be removed or significantly hacked too. CHR-ROM bankswitching animation will also have to be removed unless you target your hack specifically for TGD6.<br />Back in the day I think they used a hardware in-circuit-emulator for the hacking. These days it's best to use a software emulator with debugger of course.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Tue Aug 24, 2010 11:54 am</p><hr />

Someone sent me a link to this video, which is apparently a Game Doctor disk (for the FDS) of Family BASIC:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxk9m8xbXiU" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxk9m8xbXiU</a><br /><br /><strong>Please don't e-mail him!</strong> I sent a letter to the uploader of the video, and <strong><em>I don't want to flood his mailbox </em></strong>with questions about this to scare him away. <span style="text-decoration: underline">I will directly report what happens</span>, but in the meanwhile, I'm wondering if anybody else has ever seen this.<br /><br />I'm curious if the Game Doctor disk will allow saving BASIC programmes to disk or if it is identical to the cart.<br /><br />Beyond that, it is an interesting curiosity to find out how the GD port maps the normal FDS RAM to the Family BASIC v3 expansion RAM and how the code of the conversion looks when compared to the ROM from the FB cartridge.<br /><br />This could all prove very interesting in making both disk or cartridge versions of Family BASIC programmes and turning cart games into FDS disk games or even Doctor Disk games.<br /><br />yes, I know that some of you think this is all pointless, but it is important: It would make it easy to write simple games and distribute them, as well as create interesting hacks or improvements of FDS titles, and possibly provide further insight into the FDS and mapper conversion. <br /><br />I could name a score of reasons that stuff like this is important, beyond my strange FDS fetish. It would also be neat to write Family BASIC programmes and save them to disk, as that alone would make it an easy-peasy step towards creating a compiler to convert the code into ROM format. <br /><br />The FB v3 cart is also battery-backed, and I wonder if the Doctor Disk port makes use of the FDS writing feature to auto-save the address range used for programmes. of course, it could simply be a direct ROM conversion and do naught more than the normal release, but it is worth investigating.<br /><br />As I said, just using it to learn how the Doctor Disk mapper conversions work would be a blessing. <br /><br />-Xious<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Tue Aug 24, 2010 1:27 am</p><hr />
