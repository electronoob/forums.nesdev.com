<br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If you figure out a way, via software, to pre-emptively "guess" when a user is about to physically yank a device off a bus, let me know.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /></div>
<br />Strain gauge or similar sensor in the USB port. As the user grabs the plug before removal, the strain gauge sends a signal that the plug is moving in the socket. The OS assumes the user has fingers on the plug and interprets this as a warning of a likely surprise removal in the next split second, so it syncs the file system.

Saves a lot of trouble from that ejection stuff. Maybe the next USB can do that. Pfft year right. Nobody cares about the programmers.
<br />
<br />
<br /> I don't know how, but a folder on my flash drive just got deleted after I opened from my flash drive on Windows 7 on my schools PC. Good thing it's on my laptop also &gt;.&gt; Stupid windows.....and technology. &gt;.&lt;

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you pulled the drive out when it was under power and writing to the disk you would still risk damaging the file system, there is already a indicator light on many flash drives. Dose not seem that would make any difference at all.
<br />
<br />tepples touch sensor seems like a good idea though, maybe even a indicator light for this as well, for example there could be a red/green dual led. The correct safe removal procedure could be to touch the drive then wait for the light to turn green then pull it out. This would be kinda nice.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The indicator light isn't sufficient. The same problem existed with disk drives in the past. You look at light. It's off. You start to eject it. OS happens to start writing at that moment. You lose data. This is why (almost?) all Macs had disk drives whose eject was controlled by the OS, and why most Macs have OS-controlled power as well. The OS can then avoid ejecting/powering off when the filesystem is in an inconsistent state, and avoid initiating any activity once the operation has begun.
<br />
<br />Too bad the Mac OS lacked process protection back then, so that it would crash fairly often, and thus cause data loss anyway. Funny how it wasn't a hardware issue, but a software one that they didn't address in the OS. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I've had no programs open at all, pulled out my flash drive and it was TRASHED. All 60 some MB of it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> Reformatted and it's fine now but still.....What the heck was windows doing? XD I just don't understand how we are this technologically advanced but can't stop the OS from doing stupid stuff without me knowing it. :/

<br />
<br />Just me flaming now.....if I make no sense I am sorry....I lost one folder that was important without it being back up and yeah.....I'm still mad. XD
