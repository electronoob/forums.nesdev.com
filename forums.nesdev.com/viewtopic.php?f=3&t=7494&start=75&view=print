<br />That or "use FitzRoy's board list with your existing romset for less bugs". Good luck finding individual ZapFC roms; most sites that Google finds have standardized on iNES. Don't get me wrong; I fully support your effort to create a list of the correct headers for North American releases carrying the Official Nintendo Seal. It's just that I'm trying to find the most pragmatic solution that results in the least end user interruption.

But a program can't write arbitrary files except to /tmp, so that a rogue program can't overwrite all the user's files. And the permission to read arbitrary files in the user's home directory and the permission to connect to a network cannot both be granted to a program at install time so that a rogue program can't disclose all the user's private files to an attacker; one or the other privilege has to be assigned later.

<br />An emulator can just implement the database (of correct iNES headers) and say "use any romset for less bugs" because it will ignore the incorrect headers.
<br />
<br />None of this needs anything from the user, including requiring them to find new files to replace the ones that already work.

<br />To distinguish an iNES container (16 bytes, first four are "NES\x1A") from any other container. Even your recommended PKZIP container has a header, so to speak. Also so that the ROM, after having its header corrected, will work on emulators that run on platforms too small for an emulator to contain a list of all verified good dumps' headers. Much of your argument appears to boil down to "Microsoft distributes a PKZIP splitter but not an iNES splitter with Windows."

It is unfeasible for them to get every possible modification added into a database. The header works just fine. Plus who cares if you do or don't want the header. Don't want it? Ignore those 16 bytes. Problem solved. Ofcourse you will have the issue of when does PRG stop and CHR begin unless you just use the checksum/hash of both to identify the game. But then your emulator can't play any modified games that aren't in your database.

<br />That's why he suggested to have the PRG rom and CHR rom separate and zip them. I really don't see the reason to do that when you're not allowed to edit the files, though. Also, as the database will in essence just be a collections of headers, you can store the size of the roms there, so there really is no good reason to have them split in the suggested format.
<br />
<br />The only reason I've been presented with for having them split in his format is to make it easier for rom dumpers to spot bad dumps, which is odd, as the dumper can perform the checksums before merging the roms. As for the new game dumps which doesn't have a checksum in the database yet; why bother? They cannot be played in this format anyway... Not in database = no play.
<br />
<br />In a new format which allows for all kinds of games, I could understand having them split, though I don't think using a rom splitter can be that much of an hassle.

It's also not an archival format because you're keeping the data in a form that was different from the way it was released by the manufacturer. If these were Virtual Console dumps, I'd include the manufacturer header, but they're not.

<br />
<br />For the last and final time, this does not replace iNES or mitigate the need for a second format. There is no such thing as rom-side mapping that guarantees proper mapping. It is an oxymoron. You cannot put users in charge of mapping and expect a mapping guarantee with traded files! Finite libraries can overcome that with a database and infinite libraries can't! A single format that achieves guaranteed mapping for both libraries is not a rebuttal, it's a unicorn, it's a wish, it's a dream you had one night with no regard for reality. I want CHR and PRG data to be CONTAINED, not COMBINED, hacks to be patches, and external mapping files required for unlicensed games only.

<br />FitzRoy appears to use the terms "frankenfile", "specialty tools", and "contained not combined" to imply that container formats used by more than one application are superior to container formats used by only one. For example, PKZIP format is used by MAME, LibreOffice (as odt and ods), Winamp (as wsz), StepMania (as smzip), Java (as jar), and numerous other applications, and tools for manipulating zipfiles come with every major PC operating system. The iNES format is used by NES emulators and nothing else, and it needs "specialty tools" to pack and unpack.
<br />
<br />@FitzRoy: Does the above paragraph correctly represent your point of view?
<br />
<br />And as for "hacks to be patches", how would you propose to handle doubling a 128 KiB UNROM to a 256 KiB UOROM? The patch to double the PRG would contain the entire fixed bank, including the copyrighted parts. Or how would you propose to handle a ROM hack created from modifying a disassembly and reassembling it? This would end up moving most bytes in the file.
