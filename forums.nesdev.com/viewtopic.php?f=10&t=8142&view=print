		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey everybody! 
<br />
<br />Ownaholic here, (but feel free to call me Julian)! 
<br />I found this site through a recommendation from somebody on NintendoAge, after an odd series of events occurred. 
<br />
<br />Basically, I just learned about the existence of reproduction carts only two days ago, and now I'm looking in to how to make them myself. I've seen all of the main websites already, and considered buying from some of them, but the main problem is the lack of SNES reproductions in the market. 
<br />
<br />I really want to learn this tradeskill, and I would absolutely love to make my own SNES Reproduction shop for games that haven't been released in America, and include games that the sites like gamereproductions.com (however cool the site is!) don't include. (IE: Star Ocean) 
<br />
<br />I have already been helped out quite a lot by some people on NA, but I still need a lot more help to get the job done. So any help that anybody can offer me, would be greatly appreciated! 
<br />
<br />I've already seen the e-zine article that NA has, covering reproduction creation, but that centered on NES repros, whereas I would focus on SNES. So I'd imagine there would be a vast difference. 
<br />
<br />Here is a list of things that I need to know, essentially: 
<br />1) How to make an SNES reproduction. (Not an NES one) 
<br />2) A list of the parts required (both hardware AND software), what each of them do, and where I can consistently buy them. 
<br />3) Label creation. 
<br />4) Box art creation. 
<br />5) World Map creation. 
<br />6) Instruction Manual creation 
<br />
<br />
<br />On a personal-note, I'm Julian! Just turned 21 in July, and have been a huge SNES aficionado my entire life. I've always loved the oldschool systems, and while I do love NES as well; I simply grew up with SNES instead. 
<br />I've actually previously owned my own video game review company called GamerFill, and we actually grew to be moderately successful! (We even talked regularly with the PRs from Blizzard and Activision) Alas, it grew to be too much work, and not enough fun, so I killed it off. 
<br />
<br />Now I'm looking in to making a video walkthrough site with a friend, which would be entirely community-based. (Heavy emphasis on retro gaming, but still including modern games) And I would love to be able to include my own SNES reproduction services for the website as well. I've got a barrel-full of ideas for the site. 
<br />
<br />Anywho, looking forward to meeting all of you! And thanks again to anybody who helps! 
<br />(For anybody who significantly helps, I'd gladly make you a cart for free once I know how)

<br />
<br />OK, new tack without the piracy overtone: How does one build Lock-On style devices that perform the equivalent of IPS patches, into which one plugs "the real deal"? Codemasters did it for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Genie#SNES" class="postlink">Game Genie</a>, and Sega did it for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_%26_Knuckles#Lock-on_technology" class="postlink">Sonic &amp; Knuckles</a>.

<br />Clearly someone has never heard of the phrase, "If you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all".
<br />
<br />Just because you are hidden by the anonymity of an online message board, doesn't make it alright to treat others rudely. So I'd appreciate it if you'd leave this topic.
<br />
<br />Furthermore, I am only interested in making games that haven't ever been released in the United States; not illegal copies of already manufactured games by Nintendo of America.
<br />If I could just "buy the real deal", I would. But considering the fact that the ones I plan on making have never been released in America, I can't do that now can I?
<br />
<br />Sheesh, the nerve of some people.
<br />
<br />*edit*
<br />Also, if you're tired of hearing people ask about this topic, why not do the kind thing and make a thread with instructions on how to do it?
<br />That is what I would likely do, once I learn it myself.

This means they don't want Nintendo or another video game publisher to sue its operators, Jeremy Chadwick and Joe Parsell, into oblivion. Some of Bregalad's comments come out of frustration with people who sign up on this board and immediately start talking about making flagrantly infringing copies of copyrighted works. This has happened numerous times over the past few years.

And there isn't much to do to make a US SNES run Super Famicom games, just cut some plastic on your Game Genie. (and hope you aren't trying to play Kirby 3 or some other game that uses the side pins to connect to a coprocessor, then you need to cut plastic on your SNES.)
<br />
<br />Of course, then you are hitting the philosophical issues of whether used game sales are worse than piracy from the point of view of the copyright holder.

<br />
<br />As I said before, the odds of NoA going after this message board over somebody teaching another person how to do this, is incredibly unlikely. They would sooner go after the big fish in the pond, and sue the people who are distributing the ROM files that other people are using to make these reproduction carts. 
<br />Suing people that make the carts, and the people that taught them how, would make little to no sense from a copyright and business standpoint. (Unless the person becomes a huge seller and is making a bunch of money selling these carts, and are also selling games that <strong>have </strong>already been released in America)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Bregalad was not really being rude. This new piracy under the vale of "Reproductions" is quite a troublesome issue. People tend to deny or write off that this is bootlegging and copyright violation. While I personally don't care so much about bootlegging of games from the 90s, when it is done for profit or solely because someone else provided a free translation it bothers me. 
<br />
<br />People that put all the effort and time into making a translation of a game like Seiken Densetsu 3 or Star Ocean certainly wouldn't appreciate somebody making a profit selling bootlegged versions of their translation to people. 
<br />
<br />Just in general, once someone is profiting from piracy it's bothersome. If you want to make your own for your personal collection I'm not as bothered by it. I can see the appeal in having these games to play on your console. However first I must recommend using a Flash Cartridge. Flash Cartridges allow you to play these games without messing with original cartridges.
<br />
<br />But if you're dead set on making your own bootleg cartridge, do us all a favor and don't be wasteful. Use donor games that are absolutely horrible and won't be missed. 
<br />
<br />Offering a "service" to build reproductions for people is problematic. While if you maintain the same price for your workmanship and parts (and accept them providing the parts themselves) you can argue they are paying you for your time. 
<br />
<br />The problem comes with people like the gamereproductions site which seems to have a bunch of different prices for different games. Given that the process for many of these games is the exact same, clearly you are not paying for something honest.
<br />
<br />One of those sites I believe sells Star Fox 2 for $100. I recall someone arguing with me somewhere saying that they were told (by whoever was selling them) that it was the cheapest it could be sold for or something like that. This is utter garbage. If you want to build a Star Fox 2 cartridge you only need an EPROM, soldering iron (+misc soldering accessories), wire, and some time. The parts to build such a cartridge could be obtained for as little as $10. That's $90 of potential profit. I'm certain you could do that in less than an hour. I'd love to make $90 per hour. But I don't believe such a thing is morally right, and it's also very illegal.

<br />
<br />
<br />I do have to say, you make a pretty solid point.
<br />
<br />And honestly, I want to learn this more for my own enjoyment, rather than to make a profit. I wouldn't be making a website like gamereproductions.com; it would be a website based around video walkthroughs for older games, with these games that have never been released in America included. 
<br />On the side, I was considering also offering a service for making reproductions for these games, as I already said, but I agree with you when gamereproductions.com's prices are borderline robbery.
<br />
<br />IF, and that's a big IF, I decide to offer a service where I will make people a reproduction cart of their choice in conjunction with the website I want to build, I would only charge a very small fee for my time, in addition for the fees it costs for parts. Rest assured, I would never charge more than like...$5-$10 extra than what the parts cost. That's it. It wouldn't be some big storefront like gamereproductions.com is.
<br />
<br />I'm not looking to make a profit off of this knowledge, I merely want to be able to provide these games to other people who never got the chance to play the game in English, on their consoles. That's what I've always wanted to do: Play these games on the console. And I'm sure there are other people out there like that.
<br />
<br />In fact, this whole situation started when I was ripped off myself. I bought an NES cartridge for Earthbound, thinking it was a legitimate release of the game that was just really hard to find, for $100 on eBay. 
<br />Little did I know, that the game never actually got released in the US, and that I just purchased something for $75 more than what I could have paid at another website.
<br />
<br />This is the very reason I want to learn: To help stop people from getting ripped off. Like I said in my original post, I never even knew about reproduction carts until two days ago when I got ripped off. 
<br />If I can create a successful community based around these non-american-released games, and if I could make these games for those community members to play; WITHOUT them having to pay $60-$100 like on gamereproductions.com, then I would be extremely happy.
<br />
<br />If you notice, the SNES cartridges are a lot more expensive on that website than the NES carts. That is because nobody else online offers the same service. There are a handful of other competitive websites that sell NES reproductions, but there are NO other websites that sell SNES reproductions. Which is exactly why he can sell them for $60-$100 a pop. And it's also exactly where my idea stems from. 
<br />But I can't stop people from getting ripped off, and simultaneously let people have those games on their consoles, without first learning how to make these reproductions myself. 
<br />
<br />With that said: If anybody is willing to take me under their wing, I would love to learn.

<br />Nope, it helps noone that fake cartridges that looks like actually released games are in circulation.
<br />Also I don't want this forum to risk anything and help people selling illegal things in the black market.
<br />
<br />
<br />Oh and before I forget I don't trust this "learn for pleasure" crap. Seriously. What pleasure is there to solder a few tiny wires into holes and programming some EPROMs ? Nope. As a EE student I can say this is one of the most annoying part of the job.

I bought an NES cartridge for Earthbound, thinking it was a legitimate release of the game that was just really hard to find, for $100 on eBay.</div><br />This is <strong>precisely</strong> why I'm fighting against "reproductions". Who can say I can trust you and make sure you won't rip off people like that ?<br />Not only this is dishonest towards the buyer, but also towards the fan translators, and towards people who helps you to tell how to make a repro for free during their free time. That's why I'm not telling anyone but instead fighting this dirty and unfair trend.<br /><br />It costs very little to build "reproductions" (read : fake bootleged crap cartridge), but can sell for a lot of money. Just kidnly ask some random people on some random nonrelated forum and they will help you to make money you couldn't do on your own.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I suppose technically, yes it is; however it is very unlikely that any company is going to go after a small-fry such as myself, or even this board as a whole, for doing that. If anything, it actually helps the developers, because it could end up leading to future purchases. </div><br />Nope, it helps noone that fake cartridges that looks like actually released games are in circulation.<br />Also I don't want this forum to risk anything and help people selling illegal things in the black market.<br /><br /><br />Oh and before I forget I don't trust this "learn for pleasure" crap. Seriously. What pleasure is there to solder a few tiny wires into holes and programming some EPROMs ? Nope. As a EE student I can say this is one of the most annoying part of the job.</div>
<br />
<br />I completely understand your stance on the matter, and rightfully so. 
<br />However, I feel that it could have been presented a little bit more lightly. 
<br />
<br />As for me, I don't see how the process of making the games COULDN'T be pleasureable. I'm not even an Engineering student, and I love to make things with my hands. So, being able to make a reproduction cart with my own two hands, would be extremely rewarding to me. 
<br />I understand if you don't choose to believe me, that my intentions are innocent with this. It is difficult to trust a random person, especially when online.
<br />I respect your opinions on the matter. However, that doesn't make my intentions any less pure and it doesn't make me want to learn the trade any less either.
