It's a NOAC, and has 3 NES games on it (Gyruss, Rush N Attack, Yie-Ar Kung Fu).  Three other games include Time Pilot, Scramble, and Frogger, none of which ever had a Famicom/NES release.  Would be cool somehow to dump those!  No idea how.  <br /><br /><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418tDwT1DjL.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />That said, there have been countless NOAC hand helds like this.

If there's more than one, one's probably the ROM (or plural) and the other the NOAC.

Note that Clean Sweep was released in 1974, two years before Atari released Breakout. Seemed like a fun game too.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />I never knew why Konami released Time Pilot. It always been a question that needed answered. They didn't do Frogger either. If they ported Gradius, they could've ported others. What a letdown.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" /> <br /><br />Irem created Kung-Fu Master, just Kung-Fu to Nintendo. Irem also released Moon Patrol in '82. This is what made me addicted to arcade gaming. The music is kickass, the gameplay is pretty fun. And overall, the whole game was extremly addictive. The GBA Version just doesn't do it for me. Atari 2600 was okay. But the NES could've really did well on this one.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /> <br /><br />Berzerk had a pretty fun, and challenging concept. I don't know if the awesome robotic synthesized voices the robots chanted could've been added, But overall it deserves a place in Ported NES Games<br />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

The only semblance to Berzerk is that you can move in 8 directions as well as shoot. The limited number of shots, dodging-behind-walls, and the ever-frightening Otto is found in berzerk but much less in Smash TV...
