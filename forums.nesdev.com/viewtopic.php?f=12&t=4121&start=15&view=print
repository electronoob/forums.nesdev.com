Nobody's going to care / listen. Whatever. I was hesitant before, because I need to expand FEoEZ for a very important optimization, which would make sticking it on a cart impossible. This is yet another justification for doing so. And then I won't have to worry about it <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php/topic,7189.0.html" class="postlink">ending up on eBay</a>, either.</div>
<br />
<br />
<br />Sorry for copying the text completely again like MottZilla but in this case, I totally agree.  
<br />
<br />If it was for doing development and for some strange reason that cart would have some kind of ultra rare hardware that you really want to use, it could still be acceptable but I would be still not that comfortable with the idea (I'm still not comfortable with destroying famicom carts). If I remember well, I saw a complete cart for 2000 yen, don't know if it's a good price since I didn't collect snes for a while.
<br />
<br />But for the Snes, you can get some copier and do your dev job, which is a lot easier than the nes so I don't see the points of destroying carts.
<br />
<br />When I see that the only reason they do that is for using fan based rom of the same game to put it back on it... My comment would be "ふざけんな" (you're kidding!?). Destroying a cart for a translation... That's pure bootlegging from my point of view.  And selling it on ebay.. That's even lower.
<br />
<br />But like you said, nobody will listen. They will continue to do it anyway.

<br />
<br />I see your point.  If you want to create one, nobody will stop you.  You bought the cart so you have the right to do anything you want with it, it's yours after all <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I just feel uneasy about the subject because I started a similar thread about trashing a cart for dev purpose.  I got similar comments on the subject. I see the points on both side and agree to some degree about both of them so that make things harder <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I guess everybody have a difference stance on what we consider "valuable" and we cannot change that.

<br />
<br />It's also the only safe way to perform stop-and-swap, which I expect to be quite dangerous for much bulkier copiers with lots more going on inside. And that should hopefully be helping with some BS-X work shortly.
<br />
<br />So yeah, I agree it's necessary sometimes from a dev perspective. Still sucks though.
<br />
<br />Speaking of which, we haven't figured out the SNES CIC format to make clones yet? That sucks ...

<br />It's nothing about being smarter than anyone else. It's a hobby that I enjoy. And I feel that it's the same hobby many of you enjoy just in a different form. Many on this forum like taking apart a game's code, exploring it, playing with it, and changing it. Just because I enjoy exploring a game's hardware instead of software, please don't look down on me.

<br />Maybe people play them till they break (like the NES), or they get thrown out when kids grow up <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" />

<br />For personal use maybe, but it would be illegal to distribute the case and/or CIC.

<br />
<br />How does homebrew on any of the platforms you've listed have to violate copyright? 
<br />
<br />Copyright stops tons of people by getting them into huge trouble... especially entrepreneurs! If you sell Nintendo's items, you'll be taking a risk. The odds are especially bad when you're using their parts for a product they really disapprove of! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> 
<br />
<br />Also from my experience, homebrew scenes are all about respecting copyrights... Except I guess in the case of modchip "homebrew" scenes, where the few actual coders illegally distribute programs linked with official libraries they aren't authorized to distribute.
<br />
<br />"How we can do this" legally is easy to answer--make your own case and either force people to install CICs themselves, find pirate CICs, wait for the CIC to be reverse engineered, move to a country where Nintendo can't sue you (whether this is legal is ambiguous), or add a SNES connector to pass CIC signals from a plugin cart.
<br />
<br />------------------
<br />
<br />Back on topic, I think Star Ocean can be ported to my 96M board described in the 128M game thread whose only mapping hardware is a '139. It could also be turned into the cheapest complete-library-running flash cart ever if you replace the '139 with a small PAL or a few more TTL for complete SRAM mapping and limiting (set by DIP switches).

<br />How? It's certainly not copyright: you're not reproducing because you're using existing CICs, and copyright statutes such as those of the United States explicitly allow for redistribution of a particular copy that the copyright owner has already distributed to the public.
