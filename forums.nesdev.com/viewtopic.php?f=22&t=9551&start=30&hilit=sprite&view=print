(A sliver is a term I use in my CHR codecs for an 8x1 pixel piece.) Genesis, IIRC, has 16 sprites and 32 slivers in 256px mode or 20 sprites and 40 slivers in 320px mode (<a href="http://www.sega-16.com/forum/showthread.php?14387-true-limits-of-Sega-Genesis-VDP" class="postlink">source</a>). TG16 also has 16 sprites and 32 slivers. But in the fourth-generation case, layering is less necessary because sprites already have 15 colors.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Tepples could confirm or infirm this [on GBA], because I'm just saying this by memory.</div><br />I defer to nocash. See <a href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm#lcdobjoverview" class="postlink">GBATEK: LCD OBJ Overview</a>. But then you don't need layering at all on GBA because GBA supports 255-color sprites.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Regarding the GBA: is it maybe because the values are scattered among four sprites instead of being given all to one? Though mind you, if you have multiple sprites sharing the same deformation you can group them together within the same 4-<span class="posthilit">sprite</span> boundary and reuse the values.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The NES PPU doesn't even take advantage of it's 8-bit 2.68Mhz memory bandwidth.  It has up to 170 memory access cycles per line, and takes 136 of those cycles to render a line, leaving 34 cycles left.  If you divide that by 2bpp, you could have 17 sprites per line.  Unfortunately, the PPU is hardwired to always access memory in the order (name, attributes, pattern, pattern) even when it's not rendering bg tiles.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is true, also the same attribute byte is read twice when it could have been implemented at a single read (long before the MMC5 has been invented), reducing even further the number of needed reads in a scanline.<br /><br />The C64 also reads the equivalent of attributes only every 8 lines (called bad lines) leaving the other 7 lines with less access to memory, something similar could have been implemented.<br /><br />Anyways I love how the NES hardware works even if it's largely sub-optimal. Any of those optimizations would have translated into more logic, transistors, and FIFO memory cells inside the PPU.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Then perhaps the policy would be to force another bad line when coarse X changes.<br /><br />But then the only thing that'd really accomplish would be the ability to speed up VRAM uploads by using two different VRAM ports (one for the CPU and one for rendering) like the SMS uses. It'd need memory to store both the cached attributes (34 bits), the VRAM write queue (up to seven 8-bit entries), the secondary VRAM port address (14 bits for address and 1 for increment amount), and the number of pending writes (3 bits). Based on the PPU patent's title, I guess Nintendo was trying to save memory wherever it could, and the high-speed nametable and CHR animation techniques seen later in the NES's life weren't really anticipated in 1983.
