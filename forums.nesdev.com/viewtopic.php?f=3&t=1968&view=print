<br />
<br />i was using the AND but that was causing problems with mmc1, took it out and it fixed a game.

<br />If you're making an emulator for developpement, you may show an error message "bus conflict at adress $xxxx" so the user knows why his game isn't working.
<br />
<br />Also, this is normal that doesn't work with MMC1, because the chip disable the rom automatically. Only distrete logic boards (ANROM aside I think) does have bus conflicts. Nomrally this should change nothing on commercial ROMs, only early homebrew and hacked ROM should have bus conflicts.

<br />- The ROM is a hack from another mapper, and had originally no bus conflicts. The hackers didn't take care of bus conflicts, and now there is some on the new version (typically Final Fantasy II and so)
<br />
<br />- This is a homebrew ROM and the writer did have low experience with mappers, and by reading only old doccuments, created bus conflicts without knowing what exactly they are.
<br />
<br />- This is a homebrew ROM that during devloppement accidentally jumped/returned somewhere wrong and when the game is crashing it writes to $8000-$ffff by error (for example by putting the programm counter in RAM accidentally). Or altenativly the devlopper could have done a small error with its bus conflict table or anything like that.
<br />
<br />- This is a commercial ROM or a fine ROM, but your emulator is emulating PRG bankswitching wrong, and creating bugs.

In my case though it just means looking for a "1" somewhere, since I usually only need to switch banks the one time (to bank 1), which is generally easy to find at some location or another in the rom's code.
<br />
<br />You might want to use a "lookup table" at a particular place in your rom, making it simple to know exactly where the values you want are located at.  For example, using some generic NESASM-ish code:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.org $C000<br />.db $00, $01, $02, $03, $04, $05, $06, $07, $08, $09, $0A, $0B, $0C, $0D, $0E, $0F</div><br /><br />So then if you want to switch to like, bank 5, you'd just write..<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda #5<br />sta $C005</div>
<br />
<br />..and so on.

<br />Heh, I had to do this when dumping cartridges that used this mapping method (and I imagine CopyNES has to do similar). Have the code scan the ROM for a compatible byte in the current bank.

<br />Sure it runs on a NES, just not a UOROM board. It should be thought of as a hack for a UOROM-like mapper with WRAM, mirroring and more which is directly compatible with UOROM games.

<br />
<br />I'll buy that, as long as it specifies this custom mapper in the iNES/UNIF file. And if it does that, then it shouldn't have any problem running on an emulator (as long as it supports this custom mapper you describe).

<br />Yes it is possible to specify this board in one of the extensions to iNES, by saying "Mapper 2 with bus conflicts turned off". I don't know whether UNIF has a name for this board.

<br />I actually tried that just yesterday, when trying to figure out the best way to squeeze some code into a small gap in a rom.  But it was one of those possibly too good to be true types of things, since I wasn't completely sure of the consequence of swapping the same page the code was executing on.  So even though it worked for me on the hardware that particular time, I thought I'd suggest the more foolproof method of a table.  But I'm glad to see the instruction + 1 method is apparently fine.

<br />
<br />Good to be cautious about things that might be working only due to bad luck (it wouldn't be good luck if it worked by chance, because then you'd have a nasty hidden bug!). The write for STA occurs one cycle before the read of the next instruction opcode, and the mapper hardware should respond almost instantaneously, so I think this is a solid (and elegant) technique.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The method of avoiding bus conflicts depend of what you want to do.
<br />If you want to swap only fixed bank at fixed points, go with the "instruction+1" method.
<br />If you want to swap variable banks, and have a function that does it instead of doing it inline, you're forced to use a table (8 bytes typically for UNROM is nothing).
<br />You may also use this method, especially to swap CHR banks in a CNROM or whatever board :
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ldy StageIndex<br />lda StageCHRTable,Y<br />sta StageCHRTable,Y</div>
<br />This typically represent a table containing the CHR bank to be used in each respective stage. Since this is a variable number, insted of having a second table to write over it, it is easier to just write over the original data, and if of course prevent bus conflicts.
<br />
<br />About mapper 2 hacked ROMs, I agree that modern emulators doesn't HAVE to emulate them, because proper MMC1 versions are available, and that they do run on a NES only with a MMC1. (Yeah in theory anybody could build another mapper doing more than the UNROM mapper with discrete logic chips, but this would be nothing but a kind of simplified MMC1 emulator with discrete logic chips. One could use the <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1866" class="postlink">non-simplified one</a> instead).
