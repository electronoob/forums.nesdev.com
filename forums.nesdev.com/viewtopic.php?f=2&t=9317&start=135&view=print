Some people use it as insurance against misaligned $2005/$2006 writes, but I'd rather not use this kind of insurance so I can actually see any possible bugs and fix them (you <strong>should</strong> be writing to $2005/$2006 in pairs).

Everything after the split is right where it needs to be, but the bottom half the the screen is unstable and jumps up and down by a single scan line now and again.<br /><br />What's weird is it's randomly present or not present after a reset.  If you manage to reset and it goes away, it never comes back.  Likewise if you reset enough times and it happens, it will stay there.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">irq:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pha&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $E000&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;; v = line 80 = $50 = $%01 010 000<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2006&nbsp; &nbsp;; nametable select <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #%01000000&nbsp; &nbsp;; VV-- -vvv<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2005&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #%0000000&nbsp; &nbsp;; ---- -hhh<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2005<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #%01000000&nbsp; &nbsp;; VVVH HHHH<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2006&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pla<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rti&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;; return from interrupt<br /></div><br /><br />MMC3 IRQ is set to trigger at 7F and I originally had some delays to split the screen at line 80.<br /><br />I've stripped out everything not relevant and replaced everything with constants so no carry issues, etc,<br /><br />Not worried about the timing and clean split and scanline glitch right now.  This code above exactly as is will jitter the entire bottom half up and down by a single line randomly.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">irq:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pha&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $E000&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;txa<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pha<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ldx #$FF<br />.waste<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;dex<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bne .waste<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;; v = 80 = $50 = $%01 010 000<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2006&nbsp; &nbsp;; nametable select <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #%01000000&nbsp; &nbsp;; VV-- -vvv<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2005&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #%0000000&nbsp; &nbsp;; ---- -hhh<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2005<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #%01000000&nbsp; &nbsp;; VVVH HHHH<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2006&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pla<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tax<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pla<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rti&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;; return from interrupt<br /><br /></div><br /><br />This code however works fine, other than delaying screen split 11-12 scan lines.  Could not reproduce the jitter at all.<br /><br />Any ideas?  I could probably use what I've found to insert additional scan lines between the IRQ and the scroll, but I hate not knowing why.<br /><br />Note again, that the 06/05/05/06 code is not timed in either and BOTH exhibit the normal flickering scanline at the split location, but the top code will randomly cause the whole bottom part of the split to jitter up and down by 1 whole line.<br /><br />I've sat here for 15 mins hitting reset on the second one.  What you see there is literally the only thing changed.  The only relationship I see is writing 05/06 too close to the line where the IRQ fires.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hmm nvm maybe... I think the vertical scroll jitter is just another artifact of not timing the writes correctly.  I just thought I had because it worked in the emulator.  The veritical jitter of the whole part of the screen is another possible artifact that I just don't see on an emulator.<br /><br />Throwing in some button reads to shift the value of the .waste loop in real time so I can see if the jitter occurs only when the visible break occurs past dot 256 (eg: fine x is good but somehow v gets delayed or messed up due to IRQ entry latency variations).<br /><br />Still can't think of a reason it happens randomly between resets.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok so I altered the second example with $10 initialized to 1 so it wont loop at all, but then put in controller code to inc/dec $10.<br /><br />So it behaves like the first example now, I can load the rom, and press reset a few times until it comes up jittery.  However moving the loop delay around with the controller never gets rid of the jitter no matter where it is, it's constantly there.<br /><br />No.. wait I just hit a few spots where the jitter stops completely.<br /><br />My theory right now is<br /><br /> a) it's just a classic mistimed 06/05/05/06 write problem with respect to the current PPU cycles and vvv is getting clobbered somehow, and <br /><br />b) it only happens randomly having something to do with PPU/CPU synchronization throwing off the exact cycle of the writes that are too close to their respective write deadlines without enough window for error.<br /><br />But wait... if I reset until it's not jittering initially, I CANNOT get it to jittter at all.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Are you on the powerpak?  Because the jitter of the entire screen below scanline that it's firing is the same issue that was explained to me by another powerpak owner that I brought up previously.<br /><br />I saw the same thing in my implementation of the MMC3 and presumably Nintendo did as well.  It's due to noise on the CHR A12 line a little extra noise will cause the clocking circuitry to clock an extra time or two and as a result the whole screen jumps up a scanline or two.  I saw this on SMB3 and especially in KLAX (J).  Kevtris saw the same thing with his FPGA implementation as well.  Although he explained it was due to the improper length of filtering consecutive CHR A12 edges.  I found that changing the length of digital filtering would affect this but didn't have enough fine tuning to get rid of it completely.<br /><br />In any event adding a 220pF capacitor on the CHR A12 line cleared everything up for me.  Original MMC3 boards have 220pF capacitors and don't have problems.  The powerpak doesn't have a capacitor as far as I know.  The guy I talked to added a capacitor to CHR A12 on his power pak and solved the problem for him.  Obviously I can't be sure that's your issue but it sure sounds like it could be.<br /><br />If you haven't already it'd be worth upgrading to thefox's save state mappers his MMC3 doesn't have the issue from what he reports.  Otherwise if that doesn't work I'd suggest adding a ~220pF capacitor to the CHR A12 INPUT line to GND near the fpga and see if it helps.<br /><br />If you're seeing it on some resets and not others it sounds like the digital filter may not be set to the proper length of CPU cycles.  That would lead me to believe updating your mappers may very well solve the issue.

Are you using a mix of sprites and background?  I'm really having a hard time seeing how you pulled this off exactly...</div><br /><br />It's already implemented.  Works on the powerpak flawlessly with the latest MAP04.MAP from the PowerPak home page or the save state mapper.  I've included the init code in everything I've done so far as well as patched up some other things like explicitly setting the mapper mirror state in case the PowerPak/cart/emu doesn't have the required initial state, etc.<br /><br />There are two MMC3 IRQ hblank splits to get the text box, the middle clusters of stuff, and the floor.  That's why none of vertically overlap.  Then the final background is just animated CHR-ROM.<br /><br />This is only useful for pure side scrollers on the same flat level ground, like Zelda II fights in the grass or Kung Fu kind of stuff.  To make it useable in a game, I'd have to bring the last split up higher, have cutoffs on the background tiles so they aren't abruptly cut off by the hblank change, and then devote some vertical space to the bottom for things to jump on/over.<br /><br />To make up for it, there could be a MMC3 IRQ to put a foreground and then scroll it every line from then on out aka Sonic.<br /><br />Or if you have the CHR ROM to spare, any tiles from the BG that also vertically lap into the playable foreground area could be animated as well so you don't have to have cut offs (eg: most commercial games have a distinct dither to black fade that always occurs on a scanline/tile boundary, aka no vertical overlap).<br /><br />The other limitation is everything that lies on top of the furthest background is distinctively square and obviously tiled.  If you had an irregular shape it would either have to sit in a obvious box of solid color, breaking up the overlay effect, or you'd quickly exhaust your CHR-RAM buy having 32 copies of any metatile that had background showing through behind it.

The hills/pillars scroll normally, but CHR bankswitching is used to delay the movement of the background rocks to make it look like they're scrolling slower. In order to have full control of the position of the rocks, 32 versions of the background pattern are necessary (since it's 32 pixels wide), and the appropriate one is selected for each frame depending on the scroll.
