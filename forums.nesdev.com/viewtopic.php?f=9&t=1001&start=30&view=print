		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Also, about ROM sockets I thought I'd mention another option.  That's to just use 2 sockets (one to solder to the cart, and another for the ROM chip to sit in.  Then plug the sockets together.  They come apart pretty easily that way (use a screwdriver or something lightly to pry it loose).  And if a pin bends, the only thing to be damaged is the little $0.15 socket.  Like this type:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://futurlec.com/Sockets/ICS28.shtml">http://futurlec.com/Sockets/ICS28.shtml</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />That's what I'm doing on Squeedo right now, swapping chips so I can work on the BIOS' self-updating part.

Mine was 512kB and I payed about $200 for it a while back, really I was hoping to get a 1024kB one.</div>
<br />The fact that it's software is DOS only and it emulates only 128k is an evidence of how old that thing is. I don't think *that* one is worth the money. A 512k one is nice! That one I'd consider.
<br />
<br />I liked your idea about the sockets. Stacking two of them will avoid that anything important gets damaged. I'd never think of that, thanks for the help. 
<br />
<br />I'm thinking about waiting a little to make these orders... I'm trying to figure out a way to get a real NES too, to make everything even more reliable. I have 2 60-pin clones (nice clones, not those cheap NOAC things) and 1 clone that takes both kinds of carts (also a nice clone, looks similar to a NES on the inside, from the schematics I've seen). I couldn't find controllers that work with this one, so it isn't a good dev system. The other 2 would work well, but all 60-pin carts I have are glop top ones, so, no deal. I got a 72-to-62 pin adaptor from lik-sang but that sucks.
<br />
<br />So I figured out I need a real system before I get any EPROM programmer or emulator. That is so sad, I get no confidence at all from the systems I got. The 2 60-pin systems are great, new and all. But the other is old, rusty and previously owned by careless kids. Since I can only use 72-pin carts, I must get a good 72-pin system.
<br />
<br />I'll just see if I can get a real NES. The ones I found around here were too expensive, and thare were only 2.
