I played 1.1. Control has noticeably improved. I passed the first three goals (5 touches, 10 touches, 10 touches with faster ball), but the CPU opponent scored on me before I could pass the fourth (score on the CPU opponent).

here's an updated version of my game. I'm calling it v1.1. I'd like for you guys to test it out and comment. <br />I changed the style of the 1 player game. I broke the game itself into mini objectives. That progressively teach the mechanics and gameplay to the player. <br /><br />changes:<br />Removed all Nintendo sprites, and gimmicks associated.<br />Broke the player paddle into 8 segments for collisions, and deflection angle is determined by where the ball hits.<br />Added a acceleration variable for the P1 paddle.<br />Created the mini challenges for the one player game. <br /><br />todo:<br />Add acceleration and 8 segment collision to 2p paddle.(2p still uses the old system )<br />Chose title and fix title screen (Right now I think &quot;Ping Pong Challenge&quot;)<br />More challenges?<br />Finish music/sfx<br /><br /><br />Any ideas or suggestions are welcome, I'll try not to shoot them down too fast.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6237">DrDementia</a> — Tue Jul 01, 2014 12:54 am</p><hr />
