Now THAT'S when the developing really becomes easier. Point being, part of the charm is trying to push the envelope.<br /><br />Personally I think there's a time and place for flickery type effects. I probably wouldn't use them in games (unless I can verify that it looks OK across the board), but I think it's fine to use them in demos.

There's a reason I stopped doing anything with graphics/video circa 1997.  Kudos to anyone who toughs it out, but god the situation is abysmal today.

These patterns are discrete and &quot;forgivable&quot; to me as well.<br />I just tried to illustrate they'll always be there if checkerboard is used.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: I'm a big fan of flickering - no matter how it's done.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />Thanks (again!) to thefox for his amazing &quot;Nes Image Converter&quot; tool.
