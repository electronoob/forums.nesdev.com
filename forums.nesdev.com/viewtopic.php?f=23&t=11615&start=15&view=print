Though looking again at Tiido's diagram, it *is* just using the bottom bit... (honestly I don't know any game that actually cares about the SRAM protection anyway)

You may also need to connect A20 and A21 from the cartridge edge to the PROM.<br /><br />i.e. ROM1 has /CE<br />and ROM2 has /CE<br />and you want something that is low if either are low.</div><br /><br />Yeah I was just trying to get a 32Mbit cart to run just as one chip instead of needing two of them. I ordered a few 74HC08 chips, so I'll try it out hopefully next week.<br /><br />Thanks again for your help guys!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Not an expert in electronics but a random thought: with a flip-flop (for the $A130xx register) and a 4-way multiplexer, couldn't you just get away with using the multiplexer as a decoder?<br /><br />00 = low half of ROM (enable ROM)<br />01 = low half of ROM (enable ROM)<br />10 = high half of ROM (enable ROM)<br />11 = SRAM (enable SRAM)<br /><br />(where bit 0 is the latch and bit 1 is the MSB of the address)<br /><br />Although I'd imagine that if there wasn't something wrong with this that they'd have probably used that method for starters (unless 4MB ROMs were more expensive than two 2MB ones back then... I know many games are 2MB+1MB, including some games using SRAM, and in that case you indeed need two ROMs).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok so parts came in, and TmEE's design works great! The rewiring makes it not worth it, but it proves the concept works. So, if its really just changing how the 74'74 and 74'139 is wired, why didn't Sega do this? It would have cut down on the cost of the extra maskrom and PCB size (slightly), unless of course 32Mbit roms were just <span style="text-decoration: underline">too</span> expensive back then.<br /><br />Thanks for the all the help guys!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't recall too many Genesis games being 32 megabits anyway. There are some but there are far more 24 megs and less. I had a list once as I was curious because you could find some older Copier units that had 24 megabits of DRAM but not as many with 32. <br /><br />Sonic 3D Blast, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Those are the only two games that spring to mind that were that large on Genesis. Oh and then you have Super Street Fighter 2 which was 40 megs I think. <br /><br />There are far more that are 24 megs. Perhaps because the SNES seemed to be supported longer, there are alot more 32 meg games that could be listed for it.
