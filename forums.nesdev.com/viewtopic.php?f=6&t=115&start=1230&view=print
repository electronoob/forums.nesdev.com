I have a separate listing for those as it's easier for me to keep track of. I'm going to update that list later on.

<br />I loaded the Chiller rom and there is some music. It is just some slow "death march" kind of tune but there is something there.

<br />IT is not a request for myself but my cousin really enjoyed that game some reason and really wants me to give him the soundtrack :/

<br />
<br />Gil-Galad ripped all of them, and they've been around for a long time, well, except Dragons of Flame. He recently ripped Hillsfar. Heroes of the Lance and Hillsfar don't have credits, but Heroes of the Lance is Seiji Toda, and Hillsfar sounds like it could be the work of Junko Tamiya, but I'm not 100% sure.
<br />Dragons of Flame does have credits and Takeshi Yasuda and Hitoshi Sakimoto are the composers. DoF uses a DPCM sample in its songs. I went through the whole game. Thankfully, more times than not, the music does not contain digitized instruments.

<br />I would like Rollerblade Racer. I want the instruments from it (I know how to 'rip' instruments from the game.) I went through the game and it does have credits, but it doesn't say who the composer is, but I'm pretty sure it's Doug Brandon because he did all of the other games by Radiance and it sounds like his work.

<br />Also if anyone else has some that also need to be fixed let me know and I'll add it to my list. Just so we can keep track of them.
