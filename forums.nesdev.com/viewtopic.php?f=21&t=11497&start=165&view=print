The only way you can use color 0 is as the background color, i.e. what shows up where every layer is transparent (and in the border area too). This is true for the NES too, and the Master System, and the Mega Drive... (amusingly, this is <em>not</em> true for the Game Boy Color for some reason, which uses the color 0 from the corresponding nametable tile instead).

But it becomes important if you want to reuse the overall art style of your mockup (especially its way of conforming to hardware limits) in an original game that you plan to sell on cartridge.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />MMC5's extended attributes have become to video mockups what the VRC6 already is to audio. Only a few games used them, mostly only in Japan, and they give the NES a different class of abilities than it normally has. Lots of people love it, because it lets them feel like they're still making &quot;NES&quot; stuff, but it's easier to work with and you can make pretty things, and a lot us wouldn't use it, mostly because it's not at all characteristic of what the NES can normally do.<br /><br />The MMC5 extended attributes capabilities end up feeling pretty closely aligned with the Sega Master System's capabilities, actually. Personally, I do find it a little strange people so often want to &quot;max out&quot; the NES in this trivial way, when there's similar platforms that have that kind of capability in their typical form. (PC-Engine might be another alternative.)<br /><br />The other thing that's maybe worth thinking about is that the MMC5 doesn't cost anything to someone who only works with emulators. You don't have to work for it, you don't have to pay for it, you don't have to offer any merits of your own to get this extended capability, you can just take it. In the actual NES era, it was a hefty additional cost per cartridge, not a decision made lightly, and of course, Nintendo first had to actually realize it was possible and build the chip that could do it. Even though Nintendo built the chip, they never saw fit to use it for any of their own games, interestingly enough, and it wasn't because they didn't want those capabilities. MMC5 had a very real cost, and that's why it was so rarely used.<br /><br />I understand wanting to use it. NES + MMC5 is a retro platform that (marginally) existed in the real thing, and maybe some people enjoy it more when they don't have to work with the attribute limit, or they like having 3 extra channels of sound, or whatever. If you look at it by itself, ignore rarity, history, etc. and just look at what it can do, it's a fun platform to work with, I guess? Not the one I'd choose, but maybe you like it.<br /><br />I'm just curious, where does the term &quot;ExGraphics&quot; come from?
