The only reason I'd see this used instead is that it simplifies the sprite layering, but I can't think of any other advantages. Besides, the result is likely to look worse than real transparency.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh thank you for telling me that.<br /><br />And I don't understand what Jurassic Park is trying to do. Seems it enables the pseudo-512H mode, but with the same data for both main screen and subscreen, so this would have no effect ?<br />Pausing the screen just makes it darker, I guess this is done by darkening the palette as a whole, and I don't think the pseudo-512H mode has anything to do with that, especially considering it's also enable when the game is not paused.<br /><br />I definitely don't think you can ever blend 3 things at once on the SNES, with both real transparency and pseudo-512H mode, they are working by blending main screen and sub-screen, so in both case you can only blend 2 layers at once. The only way to blend more is to simulate it by a trick without using hardware transparency.<br /><br />Also it's quite funny, the last 3 generations of consoles before HDTVs became common all allow interlacing, but the SNES hardly ever saw it used, the PS1 saw about half of it's game using it, and the PS2 saw most of it's games using it. Isn't this a bit funny ? I guess the only reason for these choice is VRAM usage, as VRAM quantity in the console went up.<br /><br />EDIT : The only use of pesudo-H512 mode I can see is that it allows to mix a (pseudo) transparency effect and a real high resolution graphic on the same scanline (and on the same frame without using HDMA/IRQ tricks). Like you could have a textbox not taking all the screen with high resolution text in it (done by interleaving pixels on purpose between main and sub-screen using 2 different BGs), and having a pseudo-transparency effect on the playfield outside of the text box (using the 2 same BGs).

Fill rate was another, as filling 448 lines of pixels takes twice as long as filling 224 lines of pixels unless your engine is already rock-solid 60 fps like that of Tobal No. 1 and Ehrgeiz.

Even then I'd argue it looks terrible as on a CRT it'll be flickery, and on a modern display it's hard to disable the image processing that makes interlaced content look... shitty? Not really sure how to word it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />SNES and PS1 games definitely weren't designed to look good on modern LCD screens as those definitely didn't exist (or weren't affordable enough) back when those consoles were mainstream.<br />When PS2 came out LCD screens was still a novelty/niche but they became very common toward the end of the console's life. Yet, more PS2 games use interlacing than anything else.<br /><br />Interlacing looks bad on PAL because it flickers too slowly (25 Hz), but on NTSC I think it should look better (30Hz) and most developers only cared about NTSC during the development of their games.<br /><br />The fact that some cheap modern TVs does not de-interlace properly has nothing to do with the fact old games didn't use it. There exists method to deinterlace properly, but those are complicated and computationally expensive (some may also be patented). Mostly, you have to detect movement on the screen and act differently if there is movement (update all pixels at 50/60Hz) or if there is no/few movement (update odd/even rows separately when corresponding frames are sent). I did a work of this during my studies so I sort of know what I'm talking about (although I don't know what is implemented in modern LCD TVs, but I bet you see all sort of de-interlacing techniques depending on the brand, form pure cheap crap to the top high quality algorithms).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Did you try waiting a minute with it paused?</div><br />Yeah, some instructions appear on the screen, but I don't see how this makes it &quot;blend 3 things together&quot;, it's just another layer on the top of the normal playfield layers, no transparency at all.<br /><br />PS : Am I correct by assuming the following video modes &quot;exists&quot; (i.e. makes sense) on the SNES :<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">*** Progressive video &quot;modes&quot; ***<br /><br />&nbsp;256x240,&nbsp; 256x224 (modes 0-4, 7) =&gt; the most common one, everything is normal resolution<br />&nbsp;512x240,&nbsp; 512x224 (modes 5,6)&nbsp; &nbsp; =&gt; high H-res BGs at the cost of having no inter-BG transparency, sprites are normal res<br />p512x240, p512x224 (modes 0-4, 7) =&gt; using pseudo-512 H-res BG, resolution is increased &quot;by software&quot;<br /><br />*** Interlaced video &quot;modes&quot; ***<br /><br />&nbsp;256x480,&nbsp; 256x448 (modes 0-4, 7) =&gt; BG V-res is increased in software by changing the tilemap every frame, &quot;by software&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tiles should be interleaved by hand or by HDMA V-scroll updates every line.

If you enable colour averaging (add and half) as a normal transparency, and the main and sub screen are the same, this will not affect main screen pixels (as the average between 2 identical values is the value itself), and subscreen pixels will be averaged with the neighbour main screen pixel, resulting in a smoothing of the screen.<br />If, instead, a colour constant transparency is used instead, it will work like normal, and if main and sub-screen are not the same, it results in what Kirby's game does, i.e. a &quot;software&quot; high resolution.<br /><br />I should definitely test that on hardware and improve my SNES transparency FAQ to explain this stuff.

We can probably speed up code by not letting sprites overlap, and hide color limitations with attribute clashing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The most efficient way of doing hires sprites would probably be to draw sprites to 4 1-bit buffers and then convert the buffer into tile patterns with all the blank tiles removed.  The biggest issue is weather or not converting will be fast enough.<br /><br />edit:  Nevermind, there's not enough RAM anyway.  Maybe draw the shifted sprites to a small &quot;sprite buffer&quot;, and then write the tiles directly to a pattern table buffer, without any full screen buffer.
