I've attached a PPU RAM dump for Donkey Kong so you can compare the two (<tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">fc /b</tt>, <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">vimdiff</tt>, etc.) and see what's going on.  The PPU RAM dump was taken at the Donkey Kong title screen.<br /><br />The number of things wrong in your shot are almost infinite.<br /><br />I would recommend you run your emulator through blargg's CPU tests first.  My gut feeling is that your 6502 code may be doing the wrong thing.<br /><br />Also a good starting ROM is Mario Brothers (not Super, just standard Mario Brothers).

I'm currently just trying to render the background before I move onto sprites, and everything looks like it *should* be working correctly in my code.  The screen shows a different story, though.  I'm using Donkey Kong as a test game and I'm getting black, orange and gray bars on the screen.  Does anyone have any idea why this is happening? I can't seem to pinpoint the issue since my cpu seems to be filling VRAM correctly, and my PPU is reading from valid addresses.</div><br /><br />It's like the nametables are incorrectly being rendered, or incorrectly written into VRAM. Checking that bin koitsu posted against your VRAM will narrow that down. Or yeah, maybe the CPU. CPU emulation can be very hard if this is your first try. Another starter ROM you might want to try is Lode Runner. It's one of the first I got working in my emu.

I corrected two small errors and then decided I would add in all of the illegal opcodes as well so that I could complete the nestest.nes test.  I wasn't able to find Blarg's test anywhere, though.<br /><br />I'm using <a href="http://www.ataripreservation.org/websites/freddy.offenga/illopc31.txt" class="postlink">this</a> document to code my illegal opcodes and I've ran into a roadblock.  I cannot get my DCP (opcode $C3) instruction to output the correct status flags after an operation.  In the document I've been using, it says that DCP only changes the carry flag.  However, the nestest log seems to change the zero flag and negative flag as well.<br /><br />For example, at PC = $E92E in the nestest.log the DCP instruction doesn't change the processor status flags at all, even though the result of the instruction should set the negative flag.  A few instruction down at PC = $E949, the same DCP instruction is ran, and the negative flag and zero flag are turned off.  I can't figure how to replicate this result.<br /><br />So I'm wondering: is there a better document out there that explains the illegal opcodes like <a href="http://www.obelisk.demon.co.uk/6502/reference.html" class="postlink">this</a> site does for the legal opcodes?  The illegal opcodes page on the wiki tells me nothing and I can't find any other document on the net that goes into detail about the instructions.

Worry about illegal opcodes later (there's only one commercial game that I know of which uses an illegal opcode anyway).  You're going to spend a lot more time dealing with emulating the PPU and/or mappers anyway.  :-)

Now that I'm using a compare as well, the zero and carry flags are set correctly, but my negative flag is still being set when it shouldn't be.  I need my processor status to be $64 and I'm getting $E4.  Right now I'm comparing the original data to the original data minus one.

As for output, just dump $6000-$7FFF to a text file after running the test ROM for say a minute (you could run your emulator as fast as it can go so this happens more quickly). Then examine the text file.
