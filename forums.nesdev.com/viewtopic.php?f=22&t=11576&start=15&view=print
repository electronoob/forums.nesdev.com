Here is the fix to correct if the player went down a pipe and a hammer was thrown at the player at the same time they'd take damage and &quot;fall&quot; through the side of the pipe. <a href="http://www.mariowiki.com/List_of_Super_Mario_Bros.:_The_Lost_Levels_glitches#Hammer_through_the_Pipe" class="postlink">http://www.mariowiki.com/List_of_Super_Mario_Bros.:_The_Lost_Levels_glitches#Hammer_through_the_Pipe</a> This fixes it, so I'm giving the fix to anyone who wants to add it to their hack. I'm a little pissed that I ran out of room. If I find something that I can optimize I will add this in:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;In the routine &quot;HandlePipeEntry:&quot;, add this code right after the &quot;sta GameEngineSubroutine&quot;<br /><br />lda #$01&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;what we want to do is set the Injury Timer flag <br />sta InjuryTimer ;to avoid collision with enemies or hammers when<br />jsr InjurePlayer ;going down pipes<br />;so flag Z will now be cleared and we will branch off to &quot;ExInjColRoutines&quot;<br />;and then RTS<br /></div><br /><br />This fix takes up exactly 8 bytes...sigh. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" />

This glitch has got to be the hardest one to fix in the history of glitches. Originally, I had no idea what caused the glitch, as I knew there were two flags (one for player size and the other for player form) but I didn't know what was causing the glitch. It was not until I hacked the SNES version of Allstars (yeah, 65c816 is VERY similar and the code is almost verbatim) that I found the glitch actually had to do with the axe code and how it was erased. (Yes, Allstars fixes it.) The thing was, on the SNES version it took 56 bytes to fix it (0.o); space I just didn't have. But since I located the problem I knew what to do and how I could optimize enough code to create my own custom routine to fix this. So, here it is; fixed on BOTH SMB1 and SMB2J. Enjoy. There is absolutely nothing more to fix/correct on these games as I pretty much fixed every known glitch. My versions are now the most sublime versions of SMB1 and SMB2J. More sublime than the SNES, GBC etc. versions. If you find a bug (not impossible) you can report it to me.<br /><br />I am the first person in NES hacking history of hacking to fix this. If you borrow the fix, credit me. --<em><strong>ShaneM</strong></em><br /><br />SMB2J original ROM (65,000 bytes) CRC16 = BA55<br />My hacked SMB game CRC16 = 846A

The NES palettes for the most part are the same. I chose what palettes to change on the .pal file based on what I like as a preference. What's &quot;unappealing&quot; to one is &quot;beauty&quot; to another. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> ^_^

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just reviewed the original SMB2J's code after work today and I realized something else that I could do to improve this game so I did.<br /><br />When Kasumi worked on this game, I paid him to make it stop counting lives after 128. But really, after looking at the original code, I realize that nothing was meant to go above 19 lives. After 9 lives, the game would replace with Crown lives. (The SNES version went with 128 lives because it also saved lives count to SRAM for later. On the NES this was not needed as level saving was not an option. Also, to account for the fact that the Player will be awarded 100,000 pts. for every life left at the end causing an overflow with the score and strange tiles being loaded for lives.)<br /><br />So I fixed it. I made a small routine to make it stop counting lives at Crown 9, like it was intended to be. That fixes BOTH issues with score overflow as well as strange tiles being loaded. Now, I found a routine that I can potentially optimize to get me another 56 bytes. If I do it, I may also add water sprite animation cycles. But I need to figure out how to go about it. For right now, here is the 'supposed' final version with lives fix. (This fix was made to <em>both</em> SMB1 and SMB2J.) Here is my code first:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda numberoflives&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />cmp #$12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />bcs end&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />inc numberoflives<br />end:rts<br /></div><br /><br />SMB2J original ROM (65,000 bytes) CRC16 = BA55<br />My hacked SMB game CRC16 = A7AB

(If I were you, I'd generate a .lst file to assist you.)<br /><br />Thanks for giving me something else to work on. Will look into it. For bank $02, I have almost 200 free bytes left, so more than enough to work with if I need to fix that. (I have 49 or so bytes left from the Cheep-Cheep optimization in bank $00.)
