Geez damn! Power Strike II gives you half weapons on death but it's still insanely hard on normal. I like the challenge though. It makes successes more satisfying. When I was a kid however, I wasn't as good and it got aggravating.<br /><br />I think I'd like to make the challenge more balanced, so that there are skilled-based rewards, but it's possible for the player to progress through at least some of the game without a high level of proficiency. It's a tough balance, because overall, I think Contra is way too easy. However, as a kid, I never owned it, only played it a few times at other peoples' houses and I never saw past the first base. I don't want it to be so that the game is easily beaten after playing it a couple times. That's just too easy. But a lot of people aren't patient enough to get over the initial learning curve.<br /><br />I've thought about including a three-hit lifebar on the player.

So there's a crouch instead, and the slide. I find the most aggravating thing in Contra is when you die from accidentally coming out of a duck, by pressing down+direction. (If you've ever played Contra with a worn-out controller this can make you wanna stop playing) I removed this as a likely possibility, by making it so that when crouched, pressing down and a direction just turns you to face that direction. This permits you to get the guy behind you while staying ducked, but you'll have to slide to get under a particularly low bullet.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Working around that, design-wise could be fun.

I'm not a fan of the fact that you can get the end of Contra revealed with codes.

But, Stallone and Schwarzenegger sound funny, and they have distinct voices which would sound particularly funny with (impersonated) death groans.

Generally these games tend to be more heavy on enemies than bullets.

Sprites are rotated for flicker, enemy bullets are placed into buffer every frame, as well as the four most important sprites from any non-bullet object, and 1/2 of the player bullets.

<div class="quotetitle">M_Tee wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Please tell me Run n Gun is short for: Clarence &quot;Run&quot; Rundstrom &amp; Gunthar &quot;Run&quot; Washington, or the like.<br /></div><br />That's pretty good. Gunther would be a fitting name for the Austrian character. I'd also need a fitting Italian-American name for the second character.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Also, have you considered a different race/ethnicity/gender for your players? I think in 2016, correcting the dominance of white male protagonists in NES games should be taken into consideration.<br /></div><br /><br />My larger game project centers around a female protagonist. If I was doing a more serious Run 'n' Gun, I'd probably make a female character an option. However, in the spirit of parodying the original Contra, which in turn was borrowing almost all inspiration from 80s and 90s action films, I plan to portray the characters as parodies of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone.<br /><br />While Contra, Super C, and Contra III stuck with Bill and Lance and their depictions of Schwarzenegger and Stallone, (or sometimes just two Schwarzeneggers) Contra Hard Corps for the Genesis allowed you to choose from a man, a woman, a furry, and a robot. While arguably the best retro entry into the series, I don't feel like references to that game would be as widely understood, especially on an NES cart.<br /><br />How about (possibly) the world's first homosexual action video game duo? That would seem a bit more fitting. However, not being homosexual myself, am I able to make jokes about that without it being offensive?<br /><br />Also, my perspective is that there are very few exceptions where jokes about being gay are particularly clever. I feel like it gets used a lot as a cheap punchline. Two guys, acting all macho, never wearing shirts, even in the ice, they must be gay. It's lazy writing, I suppose.<br /><br />Really, what I plan to highlight is the overall way-over-the-top badassness, explosions, guns, robots, aliens, high-tech future where you can still smoke inside, of 80s and early 90s action movies. No gimmicks except ALL of the standard gimmicks and a LOT of them. This is a world where cars explode from the slightest accident and bigger is always better.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7129">darryl.revok</a> — Thu May 26, 2016 12:55 pm</p><hr />

I take issue with adding diversity merely for diversity sake. I feel like if I were playing a game made in ...let's say, Africa... and they added a 'whitey' character, merely as a marketing tactic, I would feel more offended than grateful.<br /><br />I do agree that women protagonists are underrepresented, but merely slapping a last-minute... 'Oh, you can also play as the girl' feels kind of like a cheat. Especially in this genre.<br /><br />Makes me think of an episode of Futurama, when they were watching a robot soap opera, and it had one token 'human' on the show.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7008">dougeff</a> — Thu May 26, 2016 10:42 am</p><hr />

Please tell me <em>Run n Gun </em> is short for: Clarence &quot;Run&quot; Rundstrom &amp; Gunthar &quot;Gun&quot; Washington, or the like.<br /><br />Also, have you considered a different race/ethnicity/gender for your players? I think in 2016, correcting the dominance of white male protagonists in NES games should be taken into consideration.<br /><br />Oh, and looks good.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5942">M_Tee</a> — Thu May 26, 2016 8:26 am</p><hr />

It's encouraging to see a fellow newbie with a project of similar-ish ambition to mine who's made a similar amount of progress so far. I gotta draw more sprites!<br /><br />Also, I like your homage to the smiling cigar man from Contra.<br />smiley cigar man.png<br />Timeless classic.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7498">Guilty</a> — Tue May 24, 2016 9:32 am</p><hr />
