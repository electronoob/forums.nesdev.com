		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I also looked at NESHLA prior to starting this project. It's a big reason that <a href="https://code.google.com/p/uc65/wiki/userguide" class="postlink">documentation</a> is the first listed feature, and is this first step in feature development. Nothing in uc65 was developed prior to being documented. The source code also contains complete JavaDoc documentation of all methods to help anyone that wants to contribute.<br /><br />I do understand the skepticism. I think it's very well deserved. I'll be making open source demos and a game based on the compiler to help demonstrate its usefulness, and I hope interested community members will do the same.

Anyway, once I'll learn nes assembly well enough (for now I'm just playing around with NESICIDE's Hello World example/template), I'll learn this one as it is promising (though probably still some assembly will be required, pardon a pun, so it's better I'll learn asm first).

Anyway, could you make some changes to the syntax so it won't look like BASIC so much? Perhaps use Pascal-like syntax (with declaring variables in runtime instead of var section)? This is purely cosmetic change that would help people who feel aversion to BASIC (I don't, made share of VBA, VB and FreeBASIC code and it was clean - though I admit it is easy to make spaghetti code if you don't know what you are doing and are fan of On Error Resume Next. I guess that's the price for entry-level language) be more at home with uc65. Though as this has subjective nature, feel free to ignore this suggestion if you wish.

You are criticizing dbraq to do something from scratch instad of reviving some old rotten failed project that was never proven any useful in the first place. How is this any constructive ?

This is purely cosmetic change that would help people who feel aversion to BASIC [...]</div><br />Seriously what does this mean ? You want to make him changes to the syntax just because you don't like BASIC ? Why not let him choose his favourite syntax since he's the guy behind the language ?<br />Over the years I learnt that syntax really doesn't matter much in programming, is more about how you understand the scementics behind it.<br /><br />I think that instead of doing foolish suggetions that are completely out placed you'd rather stay on subject.<br />I just asked a comparison with ATALAN because both seems to follow the same goal : Mid level languages to target specifically 6502 processors (and work around the problems that implementing C in 6502 is).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Slobu,<br /><br />Great to see interest in the compiler! I have provided memory configurations for NROM and MMC3, but if you know your way around ca65 (and that is recommended as uc65 targets this toolchain) then you can target any mapper you want. My personal choice was to get an MMC3 board with 32KB CHR-RAM and 512KB PRG-ROM Flash pre-assembled. I think this is the most versatile of the mapper choices provided with the board.<br /><br />If you dislike CHR-RAM you can choose a CHR-ROM option. I highly recommend the pre-assembled Flash versions in either case.<br /><br />INL's boards have several mapper options. As of this post you can order Color Dreams (#11), MMC1, MMC3 or FME7. FME7 is a more capable mapper than MMC3 on paper, but I just prefer MMC3's scan-line counter interrupt over FME7's CPU cycle counter interrupt.<br /><br />As I said, with a little tinkering you can make the compiler target any of these mappers. And if that's a bit over your head, just let me know what mapper you want to target and I'll create the mapper support for it. Just remember that you'll still have to understand the behavior of the mapper and use it correctly in your code.<br /><br />Thanks!

It's got 32 levels of side-scrolling awesome <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Castlevania and Mega Man 1 and 2 were implemented with UxROM, which has nothing special in it at all. Just one PRG bank and CHR-RAM.<br /><br />The first example shows a star field with a sprite-based cursor that can be moved around the screen with the controller. This uses the MMC3 mapper for no other reason than it was the only dev cart I had at the time <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> You can find it in the exampes/nes/simple directory in the zip file. The next example is supposed to be some sort of variation on Conway's Game of Life, will target NROM and may end up being my compo entry if I can't get some better inspiration <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
