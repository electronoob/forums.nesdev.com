I've re-worked the design document and changed the tone to PG and it turned out better for it. The first draft made reference to an obscure manga-within-a-manga that I was exposed to through the manga's cartoon adaptation. I think it was a lot funnier to me that it would have been to most others. Now the only reference in it is to the Bio Force Ape fake prototype thread, and I think the effect is roughly the same if you're not familiar with the source material.<br /><br />After the first post I thought it would be a shame to work on a game and not be able to share all of it with my son.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3706">qbradq</a> — Wed Nov 27, 2013 4:36 pm</p><hr />

IMO the foul language would be okay if it were able to be turned off via the menu and defaulted to clean language at startup for children.  I don't think it matters as much on the compo submission as it does on the multicart.  That's pretty much how it went down last time.  Slappin B* was renamed for the cart, and the nudie girl game wasn't considered for inclusion in the cart however it was accepted as a compo submission.<br /><br />As for the categories the discussions thus far have all been along the lines of the main 3.  The exact rules of each category are what is still up in the air.<br /><br />Here's my proposition for the final categories:<br /><ul><li>Main compo: max ROM 64KB, compatible with current mapper28 (no PRG-RAM).</li><li>App compo: max ROM 8KB, compatible with current mapper28.</li><li>Anything goes: wild west of NES/FC, everything accepted.</li></ul><br />Sounds like that works for everyone that's chimed in, I agree with qbradq about decision by committee.  We've had a few mentions of finer details like of judging criteria, prizes, registration, specific rules of each category.  So everyone's had a chance to chime in and voice their opinion.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Wed Nov 27, 2013 4:01 pm</p><hr />

I would think the consensus is to shy away from explicit content. That being said, Slappin' B_____ was included last time. I've got young kids who will probably be watching me testing. While they can't read, they can see lewd images I would rather them not see. Personally, I'm sure everyone has different opinions.

So I know the deadline for details is a few days away, but I was wondering if there would be a rule against foul language? I'm writing my design doc (finally got some inspiration <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ) and the humor is coming out PG-13. Nothing obscene, but things I wouldn't want my five-year-old to repeat. As the whole aim of the project is to produce an entry for the compo, I'd like to find out early if I need to tone down the language.<br /><br />Thanks<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3706">qbradq</a> — Wed Nov 27, 2013 9:22 am</p><hr />

I'll put my thoughts out here.  Regarding the &quot;apps&quot; idea, I like Tepples idea of having a shared Music Engine/controller reading/etc and it makes a lot of sense.  However if we treat it as a competition, then this idea doesn't work quite as well.  I personally would rather see people concentrate on the &quot;main&quot; competition, and maybe they would.  It would just be a bit silly to have 10 entries in the &quot;apps&quot; category and only a few in the &quot;main&quot; category.  Last competition we extended the deadline since there were only a few submissions (which I don't foresee happening again).  <br /><br />So my question is, do we make the &quot;apps&quot; a competition, or just a community project/collaboration?<br /><br />As for other categories, we need to reach a consensus. I think it really boils down to what will work best for the hardware/software?<br /><br />Anything goes/free-for-all:  Super Bat Puncher really stands out from the last competition. If we keep the same rule that you can submit entries you are already working on, then there could be some rather impressive submissions (judging by some of the WIP stuff posted in the PROJECTS section).  Good points have been raised, it's the selling of the cartridges that ensures future contests and exposure to the NES homebrew scene. We would LIKE people to submit something that can go on the multicart. However, the whole idea behind the competition was just to get people out coding and finish something.  Nintendoage has a lot of homebrewers that don't hang out here, so they probably didn't vote on this poll. I can pretty much guarantee there will be more than 6 entries.<br /><br />In summary:<br /><br />Apps - contest or collab?<br />Multicart destined category - Definitely a go, nail down the details.<br />Anything goes - Honorable mentions receive carts, and possibly on the multicart?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4091">NESHomebrew</a> — Fri Nov 22, 2013 10:27 pm</p><hr />

Is the choice of 48KB informed by the mapper in some way? It seems oddly not round to me. Why not make it an even 64KB? That would allow many standard board configurations for the mappers that 28 supports.<br /><br />Also, can we clarify whether entries may be submitted that are aware of and leverage the features of mapper 28?<br /><br />I would also like to further clarify if an entry may use 8KB SRAM as most emulators provide by default, with the caveat that it may not be included on the multi-cart. That may be loosing the plot though.<br /><br />I'm so excited!
