<br />Same on me. When it'll be done, let's begin the fun aprocahing question in a similar order to this (don't hurry up too much and direcly say this is a fake !!)
<br />
<br />- How graphics were ported to NES
<br />- How the game engine was coded (assembler, tile editor, etc..., along with his method to port it)
<br />- What mapper/hardware it uses
<br />- How he did so amazingly looking sprites on the NES
<br />- How he did more than 8 sprites per lines on the NES
<br />- More insane tricky question here if needed
<br />
<br />(of course if anyone have better ideas don't hesitate, just don't say straight away it's a fake without going insane first)
<br />
<br />EDIT : It seems even after registering, you still can't just post, and need more aproval stuff. Anyway there is no reason to rush, because this guy isn't going to stop showing off this stuff right now.

<br />And I should definitely be on the memberlist, you shouldn't have searched correctly.
<br />
<br />EDIT : Tokumaru, you weren't supposed to ask all of them at once, but to wait the answer between quesiton and screw the man up a bit more each time, before being completely screwed and trashed. That's a little less fun, but anyway he'll probably be screwed as well.

<br />It's clearly not the Genesis version, but I'm wondering if that might be the SMS+FM chip version from the SMS Sonic. At any rate, it's clearly not something you can get out of the NES without using the VRC7.

<br />Something interesting I read is about "leaving M68k code". This would hang the CPU as "invalid opcode" (or unofficial). Go figure.

<br />A bit like Sony did show screenshots of CGI cut-scenes of PS2 games and say it was in-game graphics before the PS2 was released.

<br />
<br />Please, my £0.02.
<br />
<br />Well, my b******t alarm went off the minute I saw that title screenshot. I could sit here and offer my five million reasons why I know that it is a fake, but I gotta go to work. I'll just say a couple of things, such as Bregalad is right about why this guy hasn't posted it in this forum. All we've heard from this guy is talk, nothing more. How about a copy of the .nes ROM so we can test it ourselves? It looks pretty much complete (except maybe for levels). Why not use his webcam to film a short clip of him playing on his NES or a NES emulator if he cannot get it to work on a real NES? And he says it only works on his NES-DVDROM? Then it is of no use if we cannot play it ourselves. Since pretty much none of use have one of those and it doesn't work on an emulator or real NES, then no-one will want a copy.
<br />
<br />If you watch the small .mov file, you'll see NO flickering even when there are blatantly more than eight sprites on a scanline (the bit with the fishes).
<br />
<br />On the other hand, it's going to be might embarrasing if this turns out to be real...  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />

<br />2 - The only way to know if the project is real or not is to continue questioning him. The goal isn't to crush him, just to have him take his lesson if he needs to. If the thing happens to be real, then we should learn from it too, instead of being embarassed.
