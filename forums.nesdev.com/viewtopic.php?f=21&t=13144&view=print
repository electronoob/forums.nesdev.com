		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi! I'm an amateur pixel artist grown up on the NES games. I really liked the console (we couldn't afford a SNES, so I played it till the late 90's). I saw this NES comminity and I wondered if I could join somebody to make a game on my favorite console? I prefer the sidescroller genre, but rpg's are also good. (I'm not too good with shooters, like Gradius, but I could try it.) I attached some of my NES inspired pieces, others can be found on <a href="http://zoltanhaller.deviantart.com/" class="postlink">my â‰  page</a>. We can discuss this here, or you can PM me (as I see there is a feature for that).<br /><br />I don't know how long will it be available, but here, take a look:<br /><br />(EDIT: I attached the pic instead of a linked image hosting.)

Curious why you're just now getting around to putting your work into a real game. You obviously have a passion for it.<br /><br />The designs I saw look like SNES. Do you have anything 8-bit style? Although doing SNES graphics is more work, so I wouldn't imagine you'd have much trouble designing for the NES.

But this way I have many tilesets, spritesheets, level plans etc., and I know how to design and make game art, I just need a proper partner who can stay through the development. I'm fed up with minigames for net play and mobiles.<br />I don't really have 8-bit, because when I made it, programmers begin to say that they want more colorful versions, so I &quot;upgraded&quot; the art. Although the blue dwarf with the faerie were made for a 8-bit like game and has a good design documentation, I even used the NES palette found on the internet. (Ok, not 3 colors + transparency but close to it.)<br /><br />And yes, I think I can manage with the restriction of the NES, however I would need a little help here and there, the wiki wasn't too informative about this part. (Or maybe it's more simple than I think.)

(Or maybe it's more simple than I think.)</div><br />If you stuck to the palette and three colors, I'd imagine the developer would be the one translating your images into actual NES CHR banks, so I doubt you'd need to know too much. There are a few restrictions that are important. The NES can display 64 sprite at one time, so you'd need to design your characters in consideration for that fact. That's usually not an issue, because characters sized 8 tiles would allow 8 characters on screen at a time, but it could be. There's also scanline stuff which I don't think is important to worry about on your end. You can overlap sprites to add more colors but that's taking one out of your 64. You probably know about the tiles, but if not, every image has to be divided into 8x8 pixel tiles. Sometimes that might change the way you'll draw things so you don't end up with an extra tile for one pixel. A lot of the tile adjustment in the NES CHR file though will probably be done by the developer. There are probably some more things I'm not thinking about at this moment.<br /><br />I sent you a PM.

I do dislike things like Mario's bent forward knee (that's disturbing!), but I don't think your sprites have any of that. Anyway, I much prefer sprites with volume, and the new version looks pretty cool. The alternate color version reminds me of Chun-li though! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />
