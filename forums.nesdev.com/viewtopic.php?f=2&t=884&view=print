<br />I made nothing yet! But i got enouth utilities,
<br />
<br />And I can make the engine, since I found the collision 
<br />and movement data in a old thread!
<br />
<br />Yes, i can convert SNES graphics to NES
<br />properly, my way to doing this is to Use a
<br />ROM of SMW! (Yes, i own the ORIGINAL
<br />Cartridge!! Seriously!) and Extract from
<br />Savestates!

You do know the 6502? Make tech demos before commencing this project. What I suggest is making tech demos for every element of the game. Make a tech demo for the level design, make one for collision detection, etc. State your real status in programming. When I came here, I didn't even know like anything about programming. So there's no need to feel dumb. I was asking how to scroll when I came here, and I didn't even know the 6502.

<br />
<br />The code couldn't be too bad, not real simple, but mostly doable on NES.  Some stuff would probably need to be changed to keep any slow-down out of the game.  Keeping in mind the SNES CPU runs 1.5 times faster than NES (besides the 16-bit stuff) and the NES CPU will also have to handle the sound engine.
<br />
<br />For showing how to write a platform game, the Programming MC Kids article is pretty nice.  MC Kids is fairly similar to SMW also.

I think she/he can do fine with just 6502, and doesn't exactly NEED to make a SMW clone run on a PC. Was that what you even meant? Like a C/C++ recode of SMW? I will not continue rambling until I know.

To make a game of this type also requires level editor tools, which pretty much must be done on a PC.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'll concur with blargg: The point of the PC-side exercises is that making a level editor and replayer will force you to become intimately familiar with the workings of the SMW engine, and the PC's "OMG 3 GHz" brute force will let you concentrate on understanding without running into efficiency barriers.
<br />
<br />But no, Celius, the PC-side exercises don't have to be in C++. They can be in Python or Delphi or Java or Lisp or whatever floats your e-boat.

<br />Yep, for me I'd pick 6502 assembly since that's what I know best, heheh.  And it's the target platform anyways.  With emulators you can always add more RAM banks and clock the CPU faster if it's needed.
<br />
<br />I guess the trick is to keep the experimental code seperate from the actual game code (as it comes together).  That's what screwed me up in my early game projects, as soon as weird half-working (or just unfinished) code starts getting left in there the program slowly starts going to hell, heheh.

<br />(Or something more FREE? I dont want any MINGW
<br />Because -1-: I could not make it properly! -2-: It
<br />has a LOT of GIANT sized files that could not make

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, once you come up with a format, you will want to use DB statements, or incbin a data file that you make by hand with a hex editor. Maybe DB statements would be best. That's what I do when I come up with formats, I do a DB statement, and see if my format works. Then I say, "Cool! I want to make a level editor! Crap! I don't know C completely! Or ANY C++ besides the cout statement! And Qbasic is easy to learn, but I don't have time! I'm pissed!". But that's what I'd suggest. Come up with a format, test it, make sure it works, and make a level editor that will make a binary file that'll use your format, and you'll be able to incbin it into your code. If you make a level editor, remember, it doesn't have to be user friendly! This is nice! Other people won't be using your level editor, hopefully. If they are, then you'd have to make it user friendly. But I'm going to stop talking, cause I have to go.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Oh by the way, if you use anything DOS related, I'd suggest QBASIC. It's really well, basic, but it's good for making cheap level editors.

<br />I'm just speaking because I've been badly burned from qbasic.  One time, I misused poke and overwrote my program in memory, another time I hit the maximum code size wall, and couldn't add any more code, or even run or save the file.  Even though I'm a former qbasic fanatic, the Zelda 2 editor was way too much for it to handle.
