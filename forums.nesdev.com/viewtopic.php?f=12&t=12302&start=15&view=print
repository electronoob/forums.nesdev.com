A jump table is a list of jump instructions to each subroutine (rather than storing their addresses), where you do a relative jump to the one you want and then it jumps again into the expected subroutine.<br /><br />In the end both are the same kind of hell for disassembling anyway, because the disassembler has no way to tell for sure up to where it can end up going. Jump tables and pointer lists need to be specified manually.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think if you want to optimize a game to reduce or eliminate slowdown you are better off manually trying to do so. Any automated program for such a thing is likely to do a poorer job compared to a person that knows the whole picture, or atleast the bigger picture. I don't think there would be a one size fits all solution for optimizing these sorts of games. If you want something more like that I think you just need to look into overclocking the CPU or otherwise getting more CPU time. On an emulator it could be done more easily ofcourse.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Tepples also pointed out the larger issue, which is the <strong>halting problem</strong>.  Computers are pretty poor at making decisions based on examining code.  Optimizing compilers, for example, work well because the programming &quot;rules&quot; of C forbid the programmer to write outside of defined variables, arrays, etc., so the optimizer knows (well enough) what data/variables never get used in the code and can eliminate them.<br /><br />With assembly code on the (S)NES, it's a free-for-all, and code can jump or read/write anywhere, anytime, and this <em>is</em> the rule built into the assembly instructions.  Software can't catch all possibilities, only emulate the code and show hotspots, etc to the user, and mmaybe suggest optimizations.  The implementation would still be up to the programmer to do.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The problems with things like this are, if you got rid of even one LDA, wouldn't it offset the entire game and cause pointers to go to the wrong place and mess everything up? I guess you could write NOP, but that still takes up 2 clock cycles. The only real non-crazy way to do something like this that I can think of would be if you had the source code, but I'm sure that even the developers haven't kept track of it...

Also yes, this seems to be pretty common, especially for code written in assembly.

If two or more, you can insert a branch.

'Annoying' would be better, relative for what's at task. 65C02 and later models have jmp [table,x]. For jsr [table,x], which didn't exist on the 6280, I just jsr'd to the jump table,x instruction. I never needed to build anything out in ram, but I've seen it enough times in commercial games (pce mostly). I haven't seen anything for stack use that couldn't have been done another way (with the same amount of effort), outside my own convoluted use for such things (making BRA.long macro for code that has all relative branch, allowing it to work in different cpu logical address locations) - but that also hasn't seemed to deter devs from doing it (macros maybe? I think FF1 on nes does something to what I'm referring to).

Such a patch would change only the inner loops that cause the most slowdown, allowing the vast majority of the file to remain unchanged. Another is as a list of discovered basic blocks (including inbound jumps) and optimization choices that a custom patcher could apply. This would allow larger changes that move big things around but might require end users to install a runtime environment (such as Python or a C compiler) to run the patcher.

It's the best way** to ensure you don't get dinged for copyright infringement.<br /><br />Please make sure whatever patching method you use is in a format that's supported by easy-to-use tools for both Windows and *IX systems.  For example, there are several &quot;IPS extensions&quot; that many IPS patchers on Windows do not support, thus bail out or crash (or some do the wrong thing entirely) when encountered.<br /><br />** -- I will not be catering to Aspies who want to argue/debate/discuss what a better way is, or how it's still possible that IP violations could happen even with IPS (yes it's possible but I've yet to hear of a single major game company complaining over such things.  Full ROMs, incl. modified, are what they go looking for usually -- exceptions are situations like containing copyrighted graphics.  I can tell a story that happened with Parodius and a takedown notice if people want an example)
