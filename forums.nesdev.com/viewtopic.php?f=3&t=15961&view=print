That is good enough for Wèilái Xiǎozi, but not for Diébiàn. The actual bank seems to be not $4102 plus a fixed &quot;plus three&quot;, but &quot;plus number of previous $4100 writes since the last $4101 write&quot;, which just happens to be three in the case of Wèilái Xiǎozi. <s>Attached find a Nintendulator Mapper source file which runs both games in their unaltered form.</s> Edit: See end of thread for updated source files.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have updated my Mapper 136 source file on the assumption that it's like Mapper 36, only with CHR. Before, I was applying the RR value to CHR immediately after any $4100-$4103 write, instead of waiting for the $8000-$FFFF write. (This would obviously be fatal for a PRG switch.) Diébiàn and Wèilái Xiǎozi both indeed finish their bankswitching code with a write to $FFFF, which mystified me before I learned about Mapper 36.<br /><br />If Mapper 36 did not have that simplified CHR ROM switch at $4200, one could maybe even have merged mappers 36 and 136. While the &quot;start RR&quot; value for PRG is loaded into bits 4 and 5 of $4102 in Mapper 36, the &quot;start RR&quot; value for CHR is loaded into bits 0 and 1 of $4102 in Mapper 136.<br /><br />Edit: Forgot a break in a switch statement.

Since both Policeman and Strike Wolf include that write to $4101 I really have to wonder if i made an experimental error in claiming that writes to $4101 had no visible effect, or if it's a difference between the upper and lower nybbles of the IC, or if it's just a different IC altogether.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Debugging Pūkè Jīnglíng (the original version of Peek-a-Boo Poker), it seems that $4101 is a XOR mask that is applied to the value written to $4102 afterwards. I noticed that when I set that game to Mapper 136, my previous emulation selected the correct CHR bank when 00 was written to $4101, and the wrong CHR bank when FF was written to $4101, and the code does EOR the bank number in a similar fashion when writing FF to $4101. Attached find another update to Mapper136.cpp that incorporates this change. <br /><br />With this $4101 behavior emulated, Pūkè Jīnglíng now runs at mapper 136 as well, though it also had CNROM compatibility code (provided that the CNROM emulation did NOT emulate bus conflicts). The game also writes to $4104, but as I understand the board's address mask, that should just be an alias for $4100 (it writes to $4104 in &quot;direct CHR&quot; mode and to $4104 in &quot;CHR increment&quot; mode). The same applies to the <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=1375" class="postlink">initial AVE release of F-15 City War</a> (overall CRC32 88A6B192), though the address mask before comparison needs to be $E123 rather than $E103 (so that $4120 is NOT an alias for $4100), otherwise the NINA-03 compatibility write will interfere. (That particular ROM is strange --- it reads from $4100 to check if the current register has the correct value, quite similar to the Diébiàn/Wèilái Xiǎozi, but then ignores the result. I wonder if AVE just hacked the NINA-03 compatibility code into the mapper 136-targeted ROM image?)<br /><br />Can you check whether writing FF to $4101 has a similar effect on the Mapper 36 board?<br /><br />Edit: I noticed that this $4101-aware emulation of Mapper 136 also covers all games (Xiǎo Mǎlí Nei-Hu version, Mahjong Block Super Mega version) of Mapper 173, including the protection. It seems like FCEUX' mapper 173 emulation is a special case emulation for two games, whereas Mapper 136 as described is the general case, as Diébiàn and Wèilái Xiǎozi do not work under Mapper 173. <br /><br />Mapper 172 (that silly Horse Racing game)'s protection read is passed as well, but the CHR bank is visibly wrong. Apparently, that game uses bits 4 and 5 instead of bits 0 and 1 for the CHR bank number, and messes up the order a bit. Probably the same IC but connected differently. Lastly, there is also Mapper 132 (Qiwang), which uses bits 0 and 1 for CHR, and bits 2 and 3 for PRG bank. Again, probably just a case of connecting the same IC in a different way.

Or perhaps it shares an engine with a game that uses a combination because it uses Chinese text.<br /><br />Or the engine uses a combination because it was more convenient. I was lead programmer for <em>The Curse of Possum Hollow</em>, which has a 62256 (32Kx8 SRAM) for CHR RAM. But if only 8Kx8 SRAMs were available, it would probably have used a setup analogous to TQROM. The level backgrounds are in CHR RAM banks 0-7, with the playfield in 0-3 and the repeating parallax strips in 4-7. These have to be in CHR RAM because they're replaced a tile at a time as the camera proceeds through each level. Banks 16-31 are used for sprites, which are always loaded into CHR RAM a whole bank at a time. Banks 8-15 are used for static background things, primarily text fonts.

Mahjong Block sometimes selects the wrong CHR bank when the playfield appears for the first time. This error occasionally occurs in other versions of the game as well, even the ones that only have NINA-03 code in them. I therefore attribute this to a game error, not a mapper emulation error.<br /><br />Edit: <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=15961&amp;p=208838#p208838" class="postlink">Updated the mapper source files</a> to incorporate recent redumps of the Idea-Tek versions of Puzzle and F-15 City War.
