<br />The 4MHz clock is for the CIC chips.  This is completely separate from anything you need to worry about (unless you are getting into RF noise issues, in which case your design is way too finicky anyway).
<br />
<br />As for the 74' chips:
<br />If the cartridge only uses the OUTPUT of the ICs, then it shouldn't matter that they are HC instead of HCT (or LS).
<br />
<br />If however the cartridge is connected to the INPUT of the ICs, then it can matter.  I don't know the schematics well enough to know how the logic lines connect here.
<br />
<br />Just based on function, the 74'373 is where I'd start.
<br />If that doesn't work, change the other chip as well as replace any Vcc/Gnd caps near the PPU (even increase their value if you want).  If there already isn't such a capacitor, add one.  At that point I am out of ideas based on current information.

<br />
<br />if the resonator is missing the lock you have in key wont function right <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />does your system show black screens a lot with the power like off?
<br />I tested it out so i know it doesnt work right! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />try hooking it up the resonator... you can get one free from an old mouse if you need
<br />I think what is going on is you aren't getting a reset signal.... or a very short one and the PPU+PP aren't liking it much
<br />that's part of the problem anyway  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />I found the fix at least for the v4 nes pcb. I bought a Toshiba 74HC373AP at a local electronics supply store and replaced the 74LS373P.
<br />The powerpak started to work after a few tries. it seems to be a little touchy.  I do have every thing in pieces now so that could be the problem.
<br />I will have to look in to it a bit more but I feel for the most part the problems is solved.
<br />next I will replace the same chip in my v7 nes pcb and see if this is a universal fix.

<br />everything seems to work great.  Most of my problems seem to have been from bad connections.
<br />at this point I would say this is a universal fix for any front loading NES with a RGB mod to enable powerpak compatibility
<br />
<br />I tried a duo ppu mod Rgb/composite+RF.
<br />For the most part I piggy backed both PPUs then I select the ppu I want by supplying it with 5V from a switch.
<br />I was also going to use a rgb led for the power led.  If I am in rgb mode it will light up blue and red for composite video mode.
<br />I Had everything working but it added more vertical lines/noise.
<br />I went back just used the RGB PPU to minimize the vertical lines. 
<br />
<br />A funny /dangerous /stupid thing I did was piggy back both with PPUs to see what would happen.
<br />I got no video but the sound would still play but it was playing very fast.
<br />
<br />After playing around I noticed older v4 NES systems have more vertical line noise in the image than the ver 7 NES.
<br />this is something to consider when RGB modding a NES. 
<br />Games run from the powerpak display vertical lines more intensely.

<br />Hey, thats great to hear!
<br />
<br />Since the part was LS, I would recommend to anyone in the future trying this that they use 74HCT373 for compatibility reasons.  HCT is both CMOS and TTL compatible.  Sorry, I should have mentioned that before.
<br />
<br />As for vertical lines, I don't have any great suggestions.  It is probably a noise pickup issue.  I have no idea why the power pak would make it worse though... there's a slight chance this is indicating a power supply issue on the PPU.  You could try beefing up the Vcc to Gnd capacitors near it a bit: just solder another one in parallel.

<br />
<br />Thats great! I am glad to hear my hard work has helped someone else.
<br />Its also nice to know this fix works for famicoms.
