It says his father had been struggling with stomach cancer for some time, and unexpectedly passed away on May 6th.  It also states that his father, best to his knowledge, was still actively developing and supporting Pasofami.  Google Translate does an OK job for this, but I'll have something more accurate/eloquent provided later tonight when I see my neighbour who can translate it accurately.  Edits/exclusions above are my own.<br /><br />This emulator and story may not mean much to folks who weren't around during the emulation heyday in the late 90s (Pasofami was originally released sometime between February and August 1996) but for those who were, it should hold some weight.  Pasofami was a commercial emulator for Windows and was known for being quite fast/efficient for its time.  It (or possibly Super Pasofami (SNES/SFC emulator) done by the same author) gained some notoriety outside of Japan, since it was known to contain copy protection that when triggered (and apparently sometimes erroneously) would recursively delete <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">C:\WINDOWS</tt>.  Regardless, Mr. ANDOU will always be considered one of the original NES/Famicom emulation pioneers.

On the night of May 5th the illness took a turn for the worse, and he passed away on May 6th.<br /><br />The below describes my father's wishes with regards to Pasofami support and services:<br /><br />1. Any in-progress development and support of Pasofami and related services/development will be terminated/cancelled.  For anyone who has already sent payment but has not received what has been contracted for, we have sent a mail regarding this matter.  Please contact me if you haven't received such a mail.<br /><br />2. Pasofami user registration will no longer be necessary.  The program GETUSRID.EXE will be released to the public.  User this to get your user ID.  For Pasofami product creation<sup>[1]</sup>, upon registration there will be a keyword that is sent; use the keyword 45-36-43-BE-00-01 for this purpose.<br />For people who have submitted registration payment but have not yet received a user ID, we'd like to refund the registration fee.  However, we do not have access to the original registration request Emails, therefore we don't have contact information for these individuals.  We do however have a record of bank transactions.  We apologise for the inconvenience, but for anyone in this situation, please provide your name and where to remit payment to, or the (mailing?) address to which to send the reimbursement.<br /><br />With regards to the Pasofami website: only a minimum amount of the site will remain; all other content will be deleted.  After confirming the status of the hosting service, something will be done with the site content.<sup>[2]</sup><br /><br />The Email address <!-- e --><a href="mailto:pasofami@mb.infoweb.ne.jp">pasofami@mb.infoweb.ne.jp</a><!-- e --> will continue to function until reimbursements reach a point where the address is no longer needed, after which we plan to delete it.  When the contents of the organization/sorting out<sup>[2]</sup> have completed, we will provide a contract address.<sup>[3]</sup><br /><br />It seems it was my father's intention to continue development and support of Pasofami, but there was a limited amount of information pass on to me, and I want to apologise if this situation/fact inconveniences anyone.<br /><br />May 11th -- Kouji ANDOU<br /><br />May 13th -- P.S. -- &quot;Old Game ROM&quot; Research BAB <a href="http://mrchecker.web.fc2.com/" class="postlink">wrote a commemorative message</a>.<br /></div><br /><sup>[1]</sup>: The term 製品版製作 (seihinbang seisaku) is used here, which can refer to several different things.<br /><sup>[2]</sup>: The description given here in Japanese is intentionally vague, so it's hard to discern what exactly is meant by this.<br /><sup>[3]</sup>: The term 連絡先 (renrakusaki) is used here, which is somewhat vague in this context; may mean &quot;contact information&quot; as well.<br /><br />I apologise for any inaccuracies, especially with regards to GETUSRID.EXE.  I personally have never used Pasofami so I'm not familiar with what's being described; maybe it's a verification key, for example.  I simply don't know.  Superscripted items are from my own notes during discussion with the translator.

It seems that most of the bytes signal emulator hacks and do not describe the cartridge hardware. At some point, Pasofami started supporting the iNES format, so I assume that most mappers cannot be represented in .PRM at all.

This in turn should make you ask questions to learn, not make ignorant statements like &quot;you had to pay for it?! but there are so many free NES emulators!&quot;  The state of emulation and emulators today is absolutely nothing like what it was in 1996.<br /><br />And as I said, Mr. ANDOU was certainly a NES/FC emulation pioneer -- one of the first.  If you weren't around during that time, or if you were but weren't part of nesdev or emulation communities, then yes, a lot of this is going to be eye-opening.  It's actually quite sad how so many of the original pioneers have been ignored; the giants upon whose shoulders today's emulator authors stand have been forgotten.  When I met with JoeGtake2 for his The New 8-Bit Heroes documentary (the footage of which was not used), most of what I talked about with him was <span style="text-decoration: underline">exactly that</span>.  I was sure to mention many names of the original nesdev/RE/homebrew and emulation participants, names which now only seem to exist in what might as well be considered the Dead Sea Scrolls -- because all of those folks deserve mention.<br /><br />Anyway...  Two other things I wanted to mention (one relates to Espozo's comment sort of, while the other doesn't):<br /><br />1. What isn't exactly made clear in the Japanese text written by Mr. ANDOU's son: there are certain words and phrasing used (mainly in Item 1) that imply Mr. ANDOU may have been hired or doing some sort of general emulation work for clients.  This is completely speculative, but it may indicate that people were hiring him or buying parts of PasoFami's core to use in other products (likely commercial).  I do not want this paragraph to cause a bunch of grassy-knoll-shooter type theories.  But this is a good example of what happens when someone (esp. with children) passes away without the details of things being passed (to family, a family attorney who handles such matters, etc.): those unaware are left confused about the nature of what the deceased was doing, and there is an uncomfortable nebulous feeling to it all, often occurring alongside the grieving process.  It's difficult to explain, and even more difficult to go through (hopefully none of you do).  As such, I think some of the vague wording is understandable.<br /><br />2. I'm aware of Japanese cultural aspects (both personal and social) regarding death and the passing of someone, and did my best to have a decent translation done while respecting those.  Sometimes depending on the nature of the situation, it can be a walk-on-eggshells type of thing, so I always approach it with respect.<br /><br />Thanks.

It says the .exe file is about generating a &quot;user ID&quot; based on a &quot;machine ID&quot;, and taking a look at the pasofami website, there's a section explaining how to get your machine ID from Pasofami (and that you need to enter this in the registration form when you buy a copy of it).  The part with the code appears to be a &quot;machine ID&quot;, the machine ID I get on my computer in pasofami is formatted the same (6x hex digits).  I'm assuming the machine ID that is given in the post might be a special value that allows the program to work on any computer, even if the machine ID doesn't match? Can't really say for sure, though.<br /><br />Also, the part about &quot;something will be done with the site content&quot;, the original text says that he &quot;has been told to remove everything but the bare minimum from the website&quot;, and that this will be done after confirming the current state of the hosting contract, etc. (and later on he says he will update the contact e-mail with the new one at the same time). It doesn't actually say who told him to do this to the website, though (I'm assuming it's something that someone in the family has decided).

I get the notion that you find this to be a failure somewhere in society, but you can't expect people to care about something as niche as this. I hear classic car fans complain about the same thing, and that's far less obscure. Maybe I'm misinterpreting your criticism.</div><br />Fair points, but in actuality, it's not society I'm necessarily expecting it from -- it's you, as someone who is part of the niche.  :-)  Society and I have never seen eye-to-eye.
