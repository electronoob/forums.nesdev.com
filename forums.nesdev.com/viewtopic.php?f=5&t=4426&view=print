		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />tonight i got owned
<br />i spent a lot of money on dinner and a date with my ex
<br />then i find out after bad sex she is still seeing someone
<br />meanwhile i was paranoid any given other felon in her apartment were going to shoot or stab me
<br />worst thing the guy she is still seeing goes to the same mental health clinic as me
<br />
<br />:(
<br />
<br />and he is some psycho native american guy
<br />so now i have to change mental health clinics
<br />
<br />&gt;:/
<br />
<br />and i am now prolly all full of stds despite wearing a condom
<br />i didn't enjoy the sex at all because i knew something was fishy
<br />i am giving up on love
<br />
<br />doesn't help that my dad treats me like trash every day
<br />doesn't help that my little brother tells pretty much everyone he meets how stupid i am
<br />it's not my fault my iq is dropping 8pts on average a year
<br />in another 10 or 15 years i will be a vegetable at this rate
<br />
<br />:(
<br />
<br />at-least my neurologist was able to reproduce the behavior in my brain in which i go partially blind by figuring out what induces it
<br />apparently when i go damn near 100% i end up having an outer body experience due to being 100% cut off from my stimuli
<br />and that is why i keep having premonitions and experiencing 'temporal displacements'
<br />apparently just watching a tv show like "csi miami" is enough to set it off
<br />
<br />:(
<br />
<br />hell eventually it will get worse to the point of just seeing the no walk signal at an intersection could set it off, while i am driving
<br />the other month the power went out due to a **massive** lightning storm and while approaching a 4 way blinking red signal i nearly ran over a cop that just looked like a spatial distortion to me
<br />
<br />:(
<br />
<br />the neurologist thinks it might be retinal migraines
<br />i think it is also combined with some form of epilepsy though
<br />
<br />:(
<br />
<br />meaning i may very well not even be schizo
<br />hell i might not even be bipolar
<br />
<br />the epilepsy would explain why my iq went from 173 at age 5 to 118 at age 27
<br />i've only done drugs a total of 30 different days in my life at most
<br />doing drugs 30 different independent days out of 27 years would not cause a 55pt drop
<br />hell you could smoke crack all day long 30 back to back days and not have a permanent 55pt drop
<br />
<br />i am pretty sure the only thing wrong with me is retinal migraine induced epilepsy along with the brain damage caused by such

<br />Poor girl.....
<br />
<br />
<br />Sorry, didn't mean to be rude, but this is hardly the place to talk about this. When we hear this stuff from someone we don't know, it's hard to even tell if it's true, because there are a lot of sick people on the net.
<br />
<br />Anyway, if this stuff is really bothering you, you should find someone close (closer than the NES programming dudes from the internet forum) to talk to.

If you think you've got some sort of problem, all I can say from recent experience is to look up Alexithymia, and ask yourself if you're 'getting a bodily sensation' from reading something, or if you 'have feelings' about it(see if you 'feel' something identifiable or just 'have sensations' about an imagined extreme). Making such a mistake will certainly make you a bit psychotic if there's a prolonged exposure to this internal misunderstanding. Also, chow down on sunflower kernels, then broccoli for magnesium and B6, so you can recover some psychological fortitude.

That's why I'm not banning jargon just yet. But I might escalate the time-outs if he keeps using General Stuff as his blog.

<br />This is not at all appropriate. Seriously, I think we all appreciate that this forum isn't like YouTube comments, and typing things like that just makes it seem trashy.

It's just too much information.

<br />I used to laugh at how often you used the word "unreliable". It's understandable, you were trying to find the correct way to do things, but it was still funny how often you used the word. At least I think it was you... my memory is a bit foggy right now and I'm too lazy to check old posts! You used an avatar with a sort of worm on it, didn't you?
<br />
<br />Anyway, nobody is a perfect poster. I not only feel that I was a bad poster in the past, but I still do it sometimes. Depending on my state of mind I may sometimes post irrelevant things, reply things after just a quick read of the topic, and other things that causes my posts to be less than interesting.

Oh, and my avatar was an alien character that I made. I started making a cartoon with that character around 2004, but I put it off for a while. It actually has a human body minus feet and the right arm. The left arm has three fingers on it. It's weird.
<br />
<br />It's true no one is a perfect poster. Though there are some posters that are so awful they just have to stop posting entirely. I was really close to being one of those posters.

<br />I don't remember Celius' early posts, but I remember he was originally a little annoying, pasting exemple code and complaining it didn't assemble.
<br />At least he was talking about nesdev and didn't take over 50% of the threads that happen on the board with crap. Jargon does. He should be banned. I doubt he will elvolve and become a great member in 1 year or so.
