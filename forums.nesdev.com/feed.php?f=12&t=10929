One could as well use normal data transfer for audio data, and then forward the audio data to APU in whatever way (only downside is that it steals some CPU time, which shouldn't matter for purposes like movie playback (unless the movie would require software decompression, of course)).<br /><br />I don't know what d4s has meant by using HDMA for audio (maybe realtime streaming with one single sample per scanline, but that won't work too well during vblank). I guess it would be best to do audio streaming via normal BRR sample blocks. BRR format is also having the advantage that it's smaller than raw PCM.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5211">nocash</a> — Sun Feb 16, 2014 6:59 am</p><hr />

I will agree with byuu about the sound. There's enough documentation about the CGRAM, and the basics of how all the backgrounds work, but the sound is some weird mystery land. <br />Even if you are a programmer and musician, you have to use trackers with the existing tools, which I assume for many non nerds is pretty weird territory.<br />I'm learning the 65816 ASM again and hit a crazy wall with just getting sound to output.<br />I think with a little bit better documentation in a few years there could be some doooope stuff coming from the SNES homebrew world.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6356">benjaminsantiago</a> — Thu Jan 30, 2014 4:59 pm</p><hr />

I think there was one attempt at it, but I think a reasonable open-source SNES music and sound effects engine and either tracker or mod module converter would really help out. While the CPU is slow so you will need ASM, and the graphics setup can be complicated, I think those are things someone can get over with some effort. But I think when it comes to the sound problem people usually just throw in the towel.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Thu Jan 30, 2014 1:47 pm</p><hr />

The major reasons:<br /><br />a) the APU. Producing music and sound effects requires the rare breed of programmer + musician combined. Very custom architecture. Have to program a communications bridge with the CPU, a new program in an obscure instruction set that lacks interrupts of any kind (especially timer and communication interrupts), work with the bizarre Sony DSP to do BRR-encoded samples and deal with all the crazy registers and their issues (KON/KOFF, etc.) You're extremely constrained for both bandwidth and memory, leading to gross and unstable hacks like HDMA audio transfers.<br /><br />b) the CPU. It's far too slow, and the instruction set does not in any way lend itself to generating decent code from C. Sure there's been some C compilers for it, but nothing remotely usable for a serious, large-scale game like you'd get with the GBA. The SNES isn't even fast enough to just write the speed critical parts in assembly, unless you are writing yet-another-Tetris-variant.<br /><br />c) the PPU. It's a bit-blender. The NES PPU has eight registers, the SNES PPU has 64 registers, and most of them pack 2-8 settings per register. And almost every setting interacts with every other setting. All of this results in one of the most complicated rendering processes imaginable. We only just recently figured out some missing hires blending details thanks to AWJ, in 2013. It's so complicated for someone just coming in ... try and do color blending. You get to mess with two windows and their positions, main and sub pixels, main/sub window enable flags, color enable flags, color blend and halve settings, window inside or outside settings, two-window overlap settings (and, or, xor, xnor), add or subtract mode from fixed or subscreen source, lores vs hires differences, direct color mode, and lots, lots more. Even something as simple as the sprite X position requires two separate tables, with crazy gotchas like &quot;don't ever put a sprite at X=256&quot; (it counts all tiles against your max tiles per frame in that case, leading to bad sprite flickering.)<br /><br />I believe the NES gets a lot more attention because it's tiny enough that you can still mostly create great little games as an individual. It's hard, sure, but it almost hearkens back to the Atari 2600 garage coding days. But the SNES adds so much complexity that you really need a decently sized team and a long development process to create compelling software. Or a savant master of all trades. And all of it has to be done in arcane '90s-era assembly.<br /><br />Once you get to the GBA - available space, C compilers, and nice libraries finally start to make things manageable. The PPU is still a bit batty there, but it's quite a bit simplified aside from adding much-desired sprite rotation, and the sound system is back to something manageable (albeit far too limited, as it's basically GB audio + a tiny PCM buffer.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Thu Jan 30, 2014 11:49 am</p><hr />

I blame the SPC for some of the lack of homebrew. But what reasons do you think are related to the lack of homebrew? There have been some projects. That Donkey Kong remake, someone was working on a Kung Fu Master remake. Then there were older SNES homebrews too, though I guess most are just demos. It probably loses some of the potential to the NES which is probably easier to homebrew for in some ways.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Wed Jan 29, 2014 10:23 pm</p><hr />

I was absolutely blown away that we got Super Road Blaster. d4s is just really amazing.<br /><br />There's always been an extreme dearth in homebrew on the SNES.

You set an address, wait for a data seek to complete (if the implementation needs to seek), and read a continuous stream, 8-bits at a time. Needs to be fast enough to read 3.58Mbyte/s.<br /><br />The second is an audio stream. You set a track number, wait for a seek if needed, and then tell it to play. You can adjust the volume linearly (for clean fade-outs and other uses), and pause/play. The actual format used by higan for the audio is 44.1KHz 16-bit stereo PCM (redbook), with a header that contains &quot;MSU1&quot; as the file format identifier, followed by a 32-bit repeat sample# (8+sample*4=file offset to seek to.) The repeat value allows you to have seamless looping. But the actual audio format isn't defined by MSU1 itself, it just needs to be able to play tracks and repeat them. It could be an actual music CD. There are no audio seek / position commands.<br /><br />It is possible to stream data and audio at the same time. The cheapest way to handle it would be one SD card for data, one SD card for audio tracks. But the nicer way is to buffer enough data and audio before starting each stream that you can fill up the buffers as the device runs. The audio bandwidth is very low compared to the max data bandwidth. (~160Kbyte/s.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Mon Jan 27, 2014 4:49 am</p><hr />
