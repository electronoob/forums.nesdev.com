I couldn't find an obvious unused area in the fixed bank, so I'll have to move some of the game's init code to bank 2.<br /><br /><strong>Solar Wars: <span style="color: #FFCC33">Patch possible</span></strong><br />This CNROM game also lacks space in PRG ROM for reset code, but fortunately, it doesn't appear to use CHR bank switching for tile animation or raster effects. I plan to hack it to UNROM so that it doesn't need the extra RAM by patching writes to $C2C0-$C2C3 to instead decompress 8K of CHR data.<br /><br /><strong>SFX Editor rewrite: <span style="color: #FFCC33">Patch possible</span></strong><br />The official version of this uses MMC1. I'd need to make a compile-time option to cut out all save-related code.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />While tracing through init code of Solar Wars to see what could be relocated, I found a bunch of bad practices: writing to $2004 to clear OAM, use of $0D as black (which confuses some TVs), lack of compression of nametables, etc. There's also some apparently unused code related to the NerdTracker II playback code at $8006, but I have no idea what it's supposed to be doing. Is there any source code for this so that I can skim it for other bad practices and rearrange it to free up fixed bank space? I seem to remember source being released a long time ago, but I don't know if it was the 1.5 version containing all the bug fixes, and it was incomplete due to drama related to NT2 and the sorry state of APU documentation at the time.

A true overhaul would require Memblers to port his music to the subset of FamiTracker supported by Shiru's FamiTone.

If it ain't broke, don't fix it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />With my experience of putting Solar Wars on Garage Cart, I can say that yeah $0D color is a problem (there is a revision of Garage Cart for it, I think that snuck into my menu palette as well).  Also I believe there is still a bug that very rarely will crash the game, just a black screen on the start of a round.  And when I put it in Garage Cart, I also had to base it on the binary, I believe at the time Chris didn't have access his copy of the revised source.  It was easy to patch though, as I'm sure you've seen with your UNROM version.<br /><br />Also regarding NT2, I think the only problematic version was the very first release (when NT2 used the PC speaker for sound).  Bananmos built his own ROM emulator for development, so later versions were well tested.

I can't reproduce it reliably enough to be able to tell if it was in the original. I had to replace robotfindskitten with my own version when some bug was corrupting the space character's tile in VRAM. And MilioNESy can occasionally fail to return to the menu on a soft reset. RHDE has some scoring that I'd like to fix later and needs a tutorial. But oh well; there's always the remix competition.<br /><br />Before beta 1 I want to have these done:<br /><ul><li>64x56 pixel, 4-color screenshots of all games (some are missing currently) </li><li>Short descriptions of all games (some are missing currently) </li><li>Basic testing of your own game and others to try to get them to misbehave </li></ul>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you Tepples for all the multi-cart perpetration work you've done. Here's my notes from testing on NTSC with powerpak.<br /><br />Menu:<br />- The 1007 bolts description should say that start button starts the game, because the game requires it but doesn't itself inform the player.<br />- The Sliding Blaster description should also note that player 2 enters by pressing a+b.<br /><br />Double Action Blaster Guys: <br />- If you start a Both-&gt;Fight game, then any single player game will fail to start due to something still thinking it's in fighting mode.<br />- The final level sometimes crashes. I think maybe what happens is killing the re-spawned (is re-spawning a bug?) head causes a crash.<br /><br />Sliding Blaster:<br />- Once you go into level edit, you can not start a normal game until reset.<br /><br />Solar Wars:<br />- Title screen glitch scrolls up on certain PPU alignments. Only cosmetic.<br /><br />Function:<br />- If emulators are correct, whatever raster trick it's doing fails on PAL systems.<br /><br />MilioNESy:<br />- Soft reset fails every time for me.

I also fixed the issue where powerups would stay enabled if they were turned on for multiplayer, though it won't remove any powerups already on the screen. Consider that an easter egg?<br />I'll try and figure out DABG's final level crash issue if I can find some time, or see if I can tweak anything that makes it stop happening (I think it's too many bombs, since normally it isn't stuffing that many objects into the enemy table).<br />Edit: Respawning is intended behavior, since it just uses the same behavior as normal levels. Also, now bombs have half as high a chance of being dropped when there are two bosses. Hopefully that helps?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I found why soft reset doesn't work on MilioNESy.<br />MilioNESy's init writes $03 to the multicart register $80, but the register selection is left set on Mode ($80) and not Outer bank ($81). So the reset stub ends up writing $ff to Mode which fails to change the Outer bank back to the menu.<br /><br />Edit: The mapper writes are at $FBBC and $FBC1, and I believe it's intended to be horizontal mirrored BNROM.
