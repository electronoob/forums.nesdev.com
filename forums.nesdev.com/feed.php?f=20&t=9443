I got bored the other night and randomly found the GBC cart that I'd ripped the MBC5 off of and decided to do a full continuity trace so I could actually get around to finishing my cart, and here's the result.  Nothing too special just yet, MBC5/XC9536 dual footprint, AM29F032B 32Mbit ROM, FM18W08 256Kbit F-RAM, JTAG header, all running at 5V.  If this works, I'll get to work on the 3.3V version.  I've already selected the parts (XC9536XL CPLD, M29W064 64Mbit ROM, FM28V100 1Mbit F-RAM), so it shouldn't be too difficult...<br /><br /><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/wwlzk1.png" alt="Image" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5348">qwertymodo</a> — Wed Aug 14, 2013 6:48 pm</p><hr />

That's awesome to hear!  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  For MBC stress testing, you might try some GBC games, especially larger ones.  The other thing to take into account is how MBC1/2/3 games run on your MBC5 emulation.  Chances are, you'll run into the same bugs listed in the thread I linked a few posts back.  So once you get MBC5 worked out, you might look into that issue and how to address it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5348">qwertymodo</a> — Wed Nov 14, 2012 7:46 pm</p><hr />

I have a working model of the ROM swithing part of the MBC1 in ttl logic (74xx based for a small game series we produced some time ago) so I'll try this with the xilinx schematic editor (that has 74xx models) to see if the cart it's ok.<br />Ok lots of work to do! let's start.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5736">xzakox</a> — Mon Nov 12, 2012 12:26 am</p><hr />

I think that my plans at this point are to open-source the MBC code, and then keep the cart designs to myself.  Honestly, there is already sufficient information out there to put one together...  I'm willing to share my work to emulate the chip, since that will provide an alternative to donor carts (though I don't know of anywhere to get cart shells manufactured, so unless I figure that out, I suppose donors are still a necessary evil...).  I'd be glad for your assistance, and if you'd be willing to send me one of your carts, that would be amazing.  I'm perfectly capable of doing the manual soldering necessary to add the JTAG header, so that's not an issue.  Do you happen to have any timing measurements from the actual MBC5 to test against?  If your functional simulations worked fine but failed on the hardware, then 99% certainty either you have bad hardware or bad timing, and I'd be willing to bet you're right on it being the latter.<br /><br />As far as my idea for setting the compatibility mode, I think now that it won't work.  The original idea was that since the compatibility mode was determined by the ROM, it wouldn't change unless you flashed a new ROM, so when you access Bank 0 in write mode, wait until you go to write the cart type byte and set the compatibility in the PLD's nonvolatile memory accordingly.  I wasn't thinking of the fact that none of the lower address lines attach to the MBC, so I have no way of knowing which byte in the bank I'm accessing.  So, I'll have to figure something else out.  Getting MBC5 mode working right will keep me busy for awhile anyway.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5348">qwertymodo</a> — Sun Nov 11, 2012 7:10 pm</p><hr />

Of course, I was not telling you to share your project, If I'm right it looks that you plan on opensource the project, so if you are, perhaps I can set up a git repo and share what I have right now, hardware and software side, and we can start working together. I never planned on making a real commercial product, just an opensource cart (like my previous one with the real MBC5), and perhaps just sell some of them at the forums, but as I say, as an opensource project. Ok, so, what's your plan on emulating the other MBCs? It's difficult to know using just the MBC's writes when a game wants MBC1,2,3 or what. The easiest way to tell is reading the cart header, but for doing that you'll need more logic, a microcontroller for example, to read that header and tell the CPLD what to be (using for example two lines to configure it as MBC1, 2, 3, or 5)<br /><br />As for my MBC5 implementation, I don't know, it looks like a timing issue. I used the xilinx simulation to look at the output of my MBC5 clone, and it does what it's supposed to do, banck swithcing, sram activation, etc, but then on the real cart, it works badly. The first tests were made using a homebrew game (the one in the screenshots), and it worked, but then with commercial games like mario or zelda, it doesn't. Then I tried using my own tests written in assembler, and I started to see some weird things. With the real MBC5 these tests work perfect, but in my MBC they do weird stuff, it looks like a timing problem, it's hard to explain. Perhaps I can show you the code of the test and shot a video with the real and my mbc5 so you can see what it does.<br /><br />Also, if you want, I can send you one of my mbc5 carts and usb programmer,  and also one of the carts I already manufactured using the CPLD, but they have a big problem,  they don't have the JTAG pins accesible, so I have to solder wires to the CPLD to program them <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br />I was too optimistic looking at the simulation so I thought I could program the chips off-board and then solder them <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/525/dsc0498nh.jpg/" class="postlink"><img src="http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/8821/dsc0498nh.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5736">xzakox</a> — Sun Nov 11, 2012 12:00 pm</p><hr />

I'm already going to be building 2 different versions, one 5v and one 3.3v.  Honestly, the 3.3v one is what I will consider the finished product, since I don't want my final design to rely on obsolete AM29F032's.  Switching to 3.3v will allow me to use current, in-production, 3.3v Flash ROMs, which also opens the door for 64Mbit ROMs.  It also allows the 1Mbit FRAM.  The 5v design is really just an intermediate step for testing my MBC5 clone.  I don't see the point in making a 3rd version with SRAM, other than cost, which isn't a compelling reason for me.  If you want a cheaper SRAM design, you can just take my MBC clone and make your own (assuming my project doesn't end like yours <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />).  As for the problems with MBC3, basically, the MBC5 is *almost* completely backwards compatible with the previous MBC's, but not quite.  The minor differences are the reason for the issues discussed and being patched in <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=5804" class="postlink">this thread</a>.  If you read the last page of that thread, you'll see my questions regarding this project and that should explain to you what I mean when I say I want to properly emulate the MBC1/2/3 for non-MBC5 games, in order to handle those issues in the PLD, rather than patching the games like they're doing there.  Can you elaborate on what isn't working with your design?  You posted screenshots showing that you at least had a game running, so where did it fail?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5348">qwertymodo</a> — Sun Nov 11, 2012 10:22 am</p><hr />

Hahaha! yes, there's light at the end of the tunnel!  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> Don't worry, it was my first project using programmable logic, so I was learning from scratch, and I was also looking at the mbc5 as a black box. Now I have a logic analyzer (the OpenBench Logic Sniffer), so it can be very handy to look at the timing of the original MBC5.<br /><br />The SRAM, ok, my bad, I was overlooking the fact you don't have a battery on the cart!  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> so, you are using fram. I also looked at frams, but some years ago there were very expensive, and as you said, I couldn't find 1mbit ones at 5V, but it'll be great not having to use a battery and the protection IC. Perhaps we can make two versions, using a smaller 3V battery (to save space) with the SRAMs i'm using right now (very low power) and the one with fram (that can be used with *almost* all the original games).<br /><br />About the /WR. I connected the /WR directly to the flash chip. Flash ICs have a nice protection schema, you need to send some unlock codes to the chip to write a byte or erase a block, so it's very unlikely than that unlock codes happen by accident. This way also has a nice side-effect, you can flash the chip from the gameboy itself. I tested this with some assembly code I wrote, and it works, you have to copy the write routine to ram, because when you write to the flash you can not read from it, and then jump to ram and execute the write routine, sending the unlock codes to erase a block (using the mbc5 to point to that block)  and writing there what you need for long term storage.<br />Perhaps homebrew folks find this interesting <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Mmmm, so what was the problem with the MBC3? IIRC, reading from the RTC registers would return nothing, and selecting them would select unused RAM banks, I'm wrong? Or you're planning on implementing the RTC? That will be great, but then you'll need a battery <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5736">xzakox</a> — Sun Nov 11, 2012 2:50 am</p><hr />
