I have three or four different revisions in my NES collection, the oldest being E (in my early NES) and the newest (in my AV Fami) being either G or H. The only difference I've noticed is the color of the screen at reset; it's usually either purple or brown on the 2A03E/2C02E, and always grey on the later ones. Also, when using a PowerPak, certain games either don't run or behave differently depending on the revision, but that might be due to other factors (variances in manufacturing, perhaps).

<br />
<br />Yep.
<br />
<br />All of the Vs. boards have an odd CPU on them, it's an RP2A03.  that's it, no revision.  It does NOT support looped noise.  Other than this it seems normal.
<br />
<br />I have an RP2A03E that was in my Famicombox, but I cannot find anything different about it.  Looped noise works fine.
<br />
<br />I have never seen a revision of CPU earlier than E, and I have not seen an F revision either.
<br />
<br />I suspect the later revs are just die shrinks to save money.

<br />
<br />So this Famicom has the CPU without revision like the VS board? Nice!
<br />The board revison is HVC-CPU-03.
<br />
<br />(By the way, this famicom is not working, I can get blank/colour screens displayed, but the cartridge doesn't seem to be recognized... oh well...will appreciate any repair-related helping tips though)

<br />Is there any bent pin on the slot?
<br />
<br />PS: You can try cleaning the yellowness by submerging the case in hydrogen peroxide. It worked well for removing that nasty yellow color from a Sega Megadrive RESET button

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have tried many different things with it, but so far, only colour screen can be seen. I don't have a clue what can be wrong... but I doubt it's the dirty connector (was my first idea), all pins are looking okay. But on RESET press, the computer behaves differently than a working one... like it's short-circuit-ing (with buzzing sound). And also the CPU is heating a lot, so maybe the CPU itself is damaged...the easiest way would be to remove the CPU and PPU and try diferent ones, but I don't want to modify the board by soldering it.
<br />
<br />PS I like the yellowed case, it's looking very classy, and it reflects its age <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
