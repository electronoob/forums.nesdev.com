Does anyone know any sites that help with learning how to use a debugger, or have a good tutorial or tips of their own?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm certainly no expert  but I have found the memory visualization aspect of FCE Ultra very useful.  I will often write values to different areas of zero page  based on regions of the code I expect to go through.
<br />I found this useful for me in figuring out why my joystick routines were not working.    
<br />
<br />Another thing I found useful was to write to memory before going into a particular bit of code.  Then write to memory again afterwards.  Then you can add a "WRITE" breakpoint based on that memory address, run until you hit the "entry"  and either step through, or run again until you hit the "exit" and view your registers, etc..

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Tracing code is a very big part of debugging... In FCEUXD, and also in that cool version of Nintendulator, it's possible to set breakpoints. Program execution will stop when an address (or range of addresses) you specify is executed, written or read, and that is useful to track down register writes, or to detect which part of the code might be corrupting a piece of RAM...
<br />
<br />There's lots of uses. FCEUXD even has an integrated assembler, you can click anywhere in the disassembly window and start typing instructions, just in case you want to try a few modifications to the code without having to assemble the whole ROM again and start from the beginning.
<br />
<br />The modified Nintendulator even tells you in which scanline you are, and which PPU cycle. That's extremely useful when writing timed code.
<br />
<br />I agree that when making your own program/game, the memory viewer and the Name Table / PPU viewer are the most useful features, but when reverse engineering someone else's ROM, breakpoints are everything.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I usually write use "sta $100" to set a breakpoint, when a piece of code isn't working and see it in FCEUltra to see what is wrong. Since $100 isn't a place you usually use for variables, it doesn't mess with anything.
<br />Seeing the scanline and cycle number when running really rocks, especially if this is accurate (as in this special version of Nintendulator). Else you can log the code, but it often crashes on slow PCs as it writes text too fast.

<br />Hey Celius, I happened upon <a href="http://desnet.fobby.net/index.php?page=documents" class="postlink">this page</a> which has a few docs written by Parasyte. I haven't ran through them much yet, but seems like it will be a good way to learn how to use the debugger features.
<br />
<br />Thanks for the replies : )

It's really huge, so that'll probably take up most of my time for the next couple of days. But thanks! They look like they could provide some useful information.
