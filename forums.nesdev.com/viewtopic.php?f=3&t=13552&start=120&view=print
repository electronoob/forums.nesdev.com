It would be amazing to see the coins in Super Mario affecting the ambient lights.<br />Also, sometimes objects merge with the background, making it impossible to put them correctly in the Z axis. This is an example from Captain America:<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
			<a href="./download/file.php?id=6351&amp;mode=view"><img src="./download/file.php?id=6351&amp;t=1" alt="CapAmerica.jpg" /></a><br />
			<span class="gensmall">CapAmerica.jpg [ 140.97 KiB | Viewed 4779 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div><br />If we (the users/editors of 3dn files) could turn off the &quot;shape detection&quot; you made, using the actual nes tiles, perhaps we could solve it. Alternatively, we could use some &quot;background removal&quot; routine to make these objects look correct.<br />I apologize for making so many requests, you must be very busy with the program code.

I would like to gather as many as possible issues to create a as generic as possible solution <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />By the way could someone help me with the following question. Performance wise, which is the ranking order of popular nes emulator?<br />I would like to ask this question because in long term i will probably give up the emulation part of 3DNes and only focus on the 3Dification part. 3DNes will become 3DRetro something like RetroArch that we could load different cores of different console systems.<br /><br />Thank you in advance!<br /><br />By the way (again) i would like to introduce to you some of latest achievements of 3DNes modders - the Mega Man series in action:<br /><br />MegaMan 1: <br /><a href="https://youtu.be/Qzwq1vzlD9k" class="postlink">https://youtu.be/Qzwq1vzlD9k</a><br />MegaMan 2: <br /><a href="https://youtu.be/KK4sr3wOyOY" class="postlink">https://youtu.be/KK4sr3wOyOY</a><br />MegaMan 3: <br /><a href="https://youtu.be/9G9nEBzA4B8" class="postlink">https://youtu.be/9G9nEBzA4B8</a>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It is very good to know that you are planning to make your technology similar to Retroarch. Genesis and SNES games will be beautiful to watch.<br />Also, would it be possible to substitute the &quot;layers&quot; to a pixel by pixel attributes of &quot;where it starts&quot; and &quot;how many cubicles of depth&quot;? It would make the preparation of 3dn files slower and harder, but would solve some problems. Your &quot;automatic shapes&quot; (H Cylinder, V Cylinder, Cube, etc) would still be useful as starting shapes, but we could refine the models in the editor (it does not need to be an advanced 3d editor, a 16x16 2d pattern would become a 16x16x16 matrix, for example).<br />A &quot;forceful editing mode&quot; would be good too, a mode that stops playing whenever a new pattern appears and asks the editor to enter the attributes of the pattern.

In one of my notebooks (dual core, 2.3 GHz), it has a huge lag between controls and response in the game (about half a second or more).<br />I am not sure, but NES emulation is quite easy on performance (in almost every emulator I tried). The hard part on performance seems to be the realtime 3Dification.
