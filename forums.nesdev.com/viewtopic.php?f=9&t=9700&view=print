That's really interesting. I mean, unfortunately we wouldn't get more colors, but a second background plane for parallax effects or huge enemies/bosses would be very welcome.<br /><br />I wonder how they intended to setup the hardware for this... each PPU would probably have its own memory, but would each be controlled by a different CPU also?<br /><br />BTW, I don't mean to hijack the thread, I just found the existence of these EXT pins really interesting. Excited about the RGB output too.

Then you could control both PPUs with the same CPU. Updating 2 independent scrolling planes would require even more careful VBlank time management, but it could make games look more dynamic (although not more colorful). A second plane of sprites would certainly help a lot too, even if they had to use the background palette.<br /><br />Damn, now I kinda want to try hooking 2 PPU together and make programs to use them. Well, I probably don't have the hardware knowledge to do it, but if someone else does it and emulators start supporting that setup, I'll definitely want to code something.

I'd have to modify it to have each PPU use half of the range that's currently dedicated to a single PPU. The new PPU would need its own 2KB (or 4KB) of VRAM for name tables, as well as RAM for pattern tables, since it wouldn't be able to access the CHR on the cart. I guess it should be fairly easy to make a &quot;kit&quot; with all of these chips (PPU + RAM + decoder) on a board that you could install on any console...<br /><br />BTW, these EXT pins are setup as inputs by default, right? Because maybe it would be bad if both PPUs were trying to output data to these pins before the CPU had a chance to configure them.

If you don't plan on using the other PPU all of the time, instead turning all rendering off disable only the background and put the sprites off-screen.<br /><br />Now that I think of it, 2 sprite DMAs would eat nearly half of the available VBlank time, leaving not much time to update 2 scrolling planes, specially when scrolling vertically as well as horizontally. CHR-RAM animations start to become prohibitive too. Screw it, I'd like to try this anyway.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As I understand it, what comes out of the EXT pins is a 4-bit palette index for each pixel being rendered, with no differentiation between background or sprites. When this data goes into the other PPU, it gets rendered only on transparent areas, and always using the background palette. This means there are some limitations on sprite usage. For one, they will always be behind the topmost background and sprite layers, second, they will always use the background palette.<br /><br />Not ideal, that's for sure, but they can still be used for items and animated level details while the primary sprites are used for more important objects. But yes, it should be possible to have 16 of them in one scanline.<br /><br />Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

Well, maybe we should &quot;bankswitch&quot; the PPUs then, instead of mapping one to $2000 and the other to $3000... Or keep them both mapped that way but also allow the second PPU to be seen at $2000 just because of sprite DMA. Having to stick to $2003/$2004 would be a worse limitation than the sprites being behind the primary layers or being background-colored IMO.
