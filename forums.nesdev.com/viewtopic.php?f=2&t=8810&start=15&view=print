I would welcome any comments, suggestions, proposed additions, requests for clarification, etc. I will post a general content outline later today. 
<br />
<br />Guiding Principles:
<br />------------------
<br /><ul> - Assume nothing. This is the only way to ensure that this book is a viable resource for beginners. In practice this means that no technical term, concept, or code snippet is introduced without being thoroughly and lucidly defined, explained, commented, etc.<br /> - Knowledge of general programming concepts must precede a description of their 6502 implementation.<br /> - A diagram/table speaks a thousand words, but that doesn't mean that a thousand words should be neglected in explaining it.  <br /> - In reference to the previous principle: Clear structure may save a few keystrokes.<br /> - In reference to the previous two principles: verbosity != quality <br /> - In reference to the previous three principles: The moral of the story is... Use as many words as necessary to provide a clear and complete description, and use no more than necessary.<br /> - Don't reinvent the wheel, don't be ashamed to stand on the shoulders of giants, and, likewise, give credit where credit is due.<br /> - In NES development, EVERYONE is a hardware person, aka, your dazzling knowledge of assembly routines will not hide your blinding ignorance of the PPU. <br /> - Modularization is a boon to clarity and manageability, aka, modularization is mandatory. This applies to code, documentation, and life.<br /> - In reference to the above: Modularity at the expense of cohesion is segregation.<br /> - Saving bytes/cycles matters and should be emphasized from the beginning.<br /> - Unnecessary complexity is a sign of arrogance, boredom, or a deficient knowledge of the topic being taught; A good teacher can make the inherently complex simple.<br /> - Don't delay in letting readers get their hands dirty; many people give up if they can't see that the basics are a means to an end. For a good example see <a href="http://diveintopython3.ep.io/" class="postlink">Mark Pilgrim's python book.</a><br /> - Work from the macrocosm to the microcosm; it's hard to get the big picture when you start with the minutiae.<br /> - Abstraction can aid in memory and readability but should always follow concrete reference. <br /> - Adopt a standardized vocabulary where possible; use terms consistently regardless of standardization.<br /> - Don't be afraid to offend the reader's intelligence; one reader's intelligence is another's lack of experience.<br /> - Write daily, without exception and regardless of inclination.</ul>

<br />This is just like economics...the top two tend to push out the contenders until one of the two has a failing that provides an in for one of the not-top-two to come in and take its place.  Same story with emulators.  No matter how hard you try, it's impossible to get people to add another emulator to their two favorites, "Nintendulator and Nestopia".   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

I hope to switch once NESICIDE is "ready", as having sound, debugging, and ability to run on my Linux laptop at the same time would be my killer feature.

<br />
<br />It's also exceedingly hard [my opinion] to describe the big picture [being able to produce a final product, a NES game], without making reference to any of the system limitations to overcome which themselves require explanation of the quirks of the system components, etc.  Perhaps another principle:  Try to avoid the phrases "which will be described later" or "see chapter 59 for more detail".  
<br />
<br />A good micro-to-macrocosm explanation I usually cite is Charles Petzold's "Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software".  In my opinion, a wonderfully constructed progression through basics of number systems, codes [Morse/Braille/etc], simple circuits [mechanical/electrical], basic computer components [CPU, RAM, I/O], all the way up to a functioning computer and on into OS/UI stuff.  Each chapter "revealing" a bit more about the computer being "built" along the way.
<br />
<br />The difference is that it's not a "how to" book.  If it were, each chapter would get progressively longer, quickly turning it into a phone book.

<br />
<br />Same exact thing with me.  I don't know why it's insisted that people start learning another higher level language first.  I had dabbled in so many and quickly gave up in frustration over the years.  Assembly is the first thing I've ever been able to follow through and finish a project in.  Now I'm moving on to learning C (with the intent on moving on to learn C++, C#, Java, etc.) and it is INFINITELY easier to pick up the stuff I'm learning than it ever has been before.  Assembly has been an amazing building block.
<br />
<br />But aside from that personal digression, whenever I see one of those "How Do I Get Started" posts in the Newbie Help Center, I usually drop in a couple links to some articles I found helpful in the beginning describing the bare, bare basics of how computers in general work.  They're just some articles on howstuffworks.com that go over bits, bytes, boolean logic, binary math, etc.  Perhaps that kind of materail would be helpful in an intro chapter?
<br />
<br />I think your guiding principles on writing it seem sound, as well.  Not really sure I have anything to add there.  I'd like to help however possible as I'm also trying to find ways to give back now that my game's done.

These sorts of constant references are typical of printed works where it is necessary to reduce repetition in order to reduce the cost involved with printing extra pages. Excessive page flipping is a totally unnecessary evil in regard to a digital book where there is no cost associated with repeating text. This problem can also be solved with a well planned, progressive structure. On the other hand, I don't see any problem with referring to an appendix as a complete reference on a certain topic. For instance, "for a complete list of 6502 instructions, their cycle lengths, and affected flags, please see Appendix B."<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">bigjt_2 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">whenever I see one of those "How Do I Get Started" posts in the Newbie Help Center, I usually drop in a couple links to some articles I found helpful in the beginning describing the bare, bare basics of how computers in general work.

<br />On that note, one thing I'd like to throw out there is this macroassembler thing: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.exifpro.com/utils.html">http://www.exifpro.com/utils.html</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />It's a pretty beautiful little tool for teaching straight 6502, I think. It allows you to write and run code immediately all with the same interface. The code only needs a single .org statement which is a little easier to explain than the header/NES initialization a rom would require, and there's no need for a second program to run the code. You can teach literally one instruction at a time, and have them run it through that to see exactly how it works.
<br />
<br />It allows you to step through code and see immediate changes. So the user can see that CLC clears the carry flag. They can see how the flags are affected by cmp or whatever else.

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Following is a VERY rough content outline. The first several chapters are fairly solid, I think, but there are obviously some huge gaps in later chapters; particularly following chapter 0A. Once I finish writing through chapter 08 (or the content currently labeled chapter 08 ), I will have a much better idea of what remains to be covered. Anyway, I wanted to get this posted, warts and all, to get some eyes on it and some feedback (particularly on chapters 00 through 0A; I know that the rest is a real mess). This will be the last content that I will post here, excluding notifications of major updates. All future content will be committed directly to my github repository.
<br />
<br />The book will be structured around four learning objective modules (general programming, NES-specific programming, game development concepts, and hardware). Each chapter will begin with a table illustrating the major concepts that will be covered under each of the four learning objective modules. An item's inclusion in this table does not suggest that the item will be covered exhaustively in the respective chapter, only that it is one of the primary topics being addressed in said chapter; the same item may appear in the introductory table of several chapters. Note: None of the information in parentheses following the tentative chapter titles is even remotely exhaustive; these supplementary comments are only intended to clarify the general scope of information covered in the chapter.
<br /><ul>-- Chapter 00 - Mise en Place: Introductions &amp; Definitions (What is programming, a microprocessor, a programming language, an assembler, etc.?) Sidebar: How to set up the work environment required for this book on Linux, Mac, and Windows systems.<br />-- Chapter 01 - Number Systems <br />-- Chapter 02 - General Programming Techniques &amp; Digital Logic (An introduction)<br />-- Chapter 03 - A Crash Course in 6502 Assembly (Basis of game introduced: I will probably use a simplified version of tepples' NROM template. This initial code example will be introduced early even though it will be completely incomprehensible given the reader's current knowledge. The code will be accompanied by the promise that the reader will be fully equipped to understand it by the end of chapter 08. Concurrently, the reader will be challenged to persevere by looking forward to this initial goal.)<br />-- Chapter 04 - The Main Program Loop (Intro to concept of interrupts/Basic structure of Assembly code)<br />-- Chapter 05 - Warming up the NES (Init Code/Brief intro to the concept of mappers)<br />-- Chapter 06 - Putting Something on the Screen (PPU, Sprites, Nametables, Looping Techniques extended)<br />-- Chapter 07 - Making Things Move (Latching controllers, basic movement)<br />-- Chapter 08 - Interacting with the Environment (Collision Detection. By this point, the reader will have been introduced to every element of the initial code example. The goal here is to attempt to hold the reader's attention through the potentially tedious basics by maximizing the sense of accomplishment upfront, i.e. the reader can now totally understand the code that looked so arcane when introduced in chapter 03.) <br />-- Chapter 09 - Beyond the Basics (Less common 6502 instructions, More Economic Programming Techniques)<br />-- Chapter 0A - Before You Go Any Further (VBlank and other limitations, NMI handling)<br />-- Chapter 0B - Ready Player 1? (The game begins in earnest. Focus on different genres, character design, story development, mechanics, etc.)<br />-- Chapter 0C - Working with multiple sprites<br />-- Chapter 0D - Scrolling<br />-- Chapter 0E - Making a Sound (APU - Essential principles of music, digital audio, and tone generators)<br />-- Chapter 0F - Saving<br />-- Chapter 10 - Beyond NROM (Mappers in depth - When is a mapper necessary? Which mapper should you use and how do you use it?)<br />-- Appendix A - Complete 6502 Assembly Reference (Addressing Modes, Instructions, Flags, etc.)<br />-- Appendix B - NES Hardware Reference<br />-- Appendix C - Tools (Other assemblers, tile editors, NTRQ/Pulsar, etc.)<br />-- Appendix D - Odds &amp; Ends (Number system conversion tables, ASCII table, etc.)<br />-- Glossary<br />-- Index</ul>

IMO you should mention mappers and tell your readers what they are for, but not much more than that.
