There are subtle differences between different Android-powered devices, yet app developers are supposed to support all of them. There are subtle differences between different web browsers, yet web developers are supposed to support all of them. Likewise, there are subtle differences between different famiclones. And as I understand qbradq's approach, it's not unlike <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/js/support.html" class="postlink">best practice in JavaScript</a>: test for the features you use.<br /><br />If a defect in a clone prevents a game from running at all or causes severe graphical glitches, then it's probably detectable with code not unlike the game's kernel. If the workaround is easy, such as the slower field rate on PAL units or the music pitch on Dendy style PAL clones, I can add a workaround into the game's next revision. But if not, such as a famiclone that behaves like Nesticle, I can detect and freeze, just like a lot of web sites have recently started to detect features not supported by Internet Explorer 6 and redirect to the Google Chrome Frame download page.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Apr 13, 2011 6:04 pm</p><hr />

So clone users would have to go into the menu every time, and this would be documented in the manual, just as the code to hide the ghost piece is mentioned in LJ65's manual.<br /><br />This leaves testing.

Glad to see I've sparked some interest Tepples <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I have noticed that the music and sound effects on my Yobo famiclone sound fine in most games, have minor hiccups in others (TMNT), and are outright awful in some (Crystalis, what a crying shame!)<br /><br />I think it has to do with how the sound engines of these games handle duty cycle changes. Crystalis changes the duty cycles of the square waves at fixed frequencies to create specific musical effects (and TMNT does this for certain sound effects). When this occurs the difference in duty cycle produces different periods within the sound wave causing dissonance with the other channels that have correct periods.<br /><br />So one way to ensure that your music sounds the same on all platforms would be to use constant duty cycles. I am not thrilled with this limitation myself, but it is something to think about.<br /><br />Also, regarding PowerPak compatibility, config settings and all that jazz, I'd like to briefly mention that this community is in dire need of an affordable, capable development cartridge with a clean and cheep path to production carts. I know there is work going on with several folks to supply this (Münchhausen, Squweedo(sp?), my own MMC3 cart that's still too early to mention <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />) and until we get this sorted out and made approachable it will be difficult to grow the platform.<br /><br />Like assembly programming for a 35-year-old chip isn't intimidating enough <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3706">qbradq</a> — Wed Apr 13, 2011 10:28 am</p><hr />

I've thought about a duty cycle selection, but the problem is that this isn't like listening to NSFs - the user has never heard the music before.  They can't know if it sounds right or not, and putting the option there makes it possible for people using a real system (or a clone with good sound) to make it play wrong.<br /><br />If they know the clone has wrong sound, they're either dealing with it already or probably have a real system that they could use, as well.  Detection would be better, but likely isn't possible in reliable way (hope I'm wrong).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Apr 13, 2011 10:04 am</p><hr />

At least not before a password is entered, if you decide to dedicate one bit for this.<br /><br />It might be a little annoying to select an option to fix the audio every time, but you can't expect to get the perfect experience out of a clone. Something's gotta give. You could maybe offer a quick way to enable the sound fix, like holding a certain button (or button combination) on power on, and document that in the manual, to make the process less annoying.<br /><br />Personally I have currently no plans to implement this kind of feature. People who own these clones are used to having wrong audio in every single game they play, including great classics, so I don't think my game being different is a big deal.<br /><br />EDIT: Ninja'd by MottZilla!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Apr 13, 2011 9:29 am</p><hr />

While it would be nice for the user not to have to select an option to fix it, I don't think there is a reasonable alternative. The best you could do is note in the options menu some button to hold down when powering on to also enable the audio fix for clones unless you actually have a battery backup or something else. <br /><br />Is the fix just as simple as having your audio engine swap the duty cycle parameter writes in some way?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Wed Apr 13, 2011 9:26 am</p><hr />

It's not like we make games for an active console like the psp, 3ds etc. People would be able to understand that if they reset the game, they need to set back the option.
