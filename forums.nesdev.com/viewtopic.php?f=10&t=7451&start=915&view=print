Even something simple like this is good.<br />Version 1:<br />Added animations.<br />Add movement.<br />Version 2: <br />Added horizontal scrolling.<br />Added 16bit movement for sprites.<br /><br />I backup <span style="color: #FFFF80">my entire source folder</span> for every major change, and keep track of changes. This allows you to only check what was changed when you have an issue. &quot;It was working. I added X, and changed Y. Now it's not. The problem is probably in X or Y, so I'll look at their logic.&quot; This also means if you REALLY screw up, you can just copy over the last backup.<br /><br />Also, never write super large portions of code without checking them. For an example of something you've done before (tile updating), you could write something that gets the two right most 8x8 tile numbers of a known 16x16 metatile and writes them to ram. Run it, and check to see the write values are written to RAM. Then you write something that writes a whole known column of the tiles to RAM. If it doesn't work, or breaks your program you know exactly what to check. Then, you make your NMI write the tiles to $2007. Then you make it so can write a column at X position. If you write a single routine that does the equivalent of all that without checking any of it, you're in REALLY deep. Especially if you have to rewrite it ALL instead of just fix it.<br /><br />And if you have no idea what was changed, you basically have to check the entire program.<br /><br />So I guess those were debugging tips, because I have no idea about the actual problem with the information given. It's time to get your hands dirty!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div><br />Thank you, this post is very wise... you are very wise Kasumi!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />   But I only mean to respond to that small yellow part I <span style="color: #FFFF80">highlighted</span>.  Your entire source folder?  You have a folder just for your source code?  That sounds interesting. My folder has the name &quot;nesD&quot; cause the year is 2013.  It holds all of my nes stuff from 2013.  How do you have a folder for just your source code?  How could I build a nes file using something like that and asm6?

When you want to make a backup, copy that folder. There are better methods than this, but this is probably good enough for a solo project.<br /><br />Edit: Inside the main source folder I have another folder named &quot;Notes&quot; where I keep a file called &quot;changes.txt&quot; that keeps track of changes in great detail, and a file called &quot;general notes.txt&quot; which is where I put possible ideas for the game/current bugs/a todo list. When the backup is made, these files are copied as well of course. So it allows me to see what I was working on in each version, which is sort of fun to look back on.<br /><br />It's better to keep things like NES specific documents separate. I would say as a general rule that anything not made by you that is not needed to assemble your rom should not be in your source folder.

If the screen is black, but the game hasn't really crashed I would assume you're just forgetting to turn rendering back on.<br /><br />Edit: Disabling rendering makes it so your screen is not drawn, so you can only write bytes to the PPU this way in between levels, not during gameplay when the player needs to see what's happening.<br /><br />The super simplified explanation is that you cannot write bytes to the PPU while it's trying to draw the screen. It's not doing so for ~2,270 cycles after an NMI fires which is why you can write bytes then. It's also not doing so when the screen is not being drawn.

Flip-screen means that there's no scrolling at all: when the player leaves the screen, it goes blank for a couple of frame (while the new screen is drawn) and then the new screen appears, with the player on the opposite edge. Concepts like &quot;vertical&quot; or &quot;horizontal&quot; don't mean anything in this case, so there must be some misunderstanding here.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Lots of games are flip-screen vertically but scrolling horizontally. Castlevania is one when going down or up stairs. Super Mario Bros. is one when going down or up the pipe in 1-2. Super Mario Bros. 2 is another when going down or up the vine at the right side of 1-1.
