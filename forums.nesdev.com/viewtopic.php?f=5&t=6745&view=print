<br />
<br />Anyway, formatting the hard drive every couple of years is not a bad thing, it helps to keep the system fast and stable. Windows can get pretty sluggish after a few years of continuous use.
<br />
<br />I'd still like to hear any comments from pro-firewall users... Since I don't know much about the subject, I'd like to understand what the advantages of using one are.

<br />This. Spending so much time online quickly develops a hunch for that kind of thing. If I've a single suspicious file I upload it to <a href="http://www.virustotal.com/" class="postlink">Virustotal</a>.
<br />
<br />I do, though, have Linux acting as a firewall (iptables/shorewall) blocking the incoming ports that I don't need to be open. Also takes care of sharing the internet and stuff like that.
<br />
<br />I did also use a Windows firewall at some point called Kerio Personal Firewall or something like that, but it has gone to shit since.

<br />Which is a pain if the computer maker hasn't included a recovery disc, as most of the major computer makers have started not to do over the past few years according to <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/10/08/03/1250249/The-Recovery-Disc-Rip-Off" class="postlink">a recent story posted to Slashdot</a>. A lot of these include the recovery data on a partition of the hard drive and allow the end user to burn it to a DVD exactly once. If that backup ends up unreadable, or if your laptop had no optical drive in the first place, tough stool.
<br />
<br />And sometimes using the firewall built into a consumer NAT router isn't enough. Once you start having problems with the Internet connection, the ISP's phone representative will tell you to bypass your router by unplugging it and connecting the Ethernet cable directly from the modem to the PC. At this point, if your modem happens to sync and your PC is running Windows, one of the various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhol_worm" class="postlink">random-port-scanning worms</a> might infect you in minutes.

<br />In that case I can only suggest the person saves money and buys his own computer and OS so that he doesn't have to deal with those problems.
<br />
<br />I did that back when I got my first job... As soon as I could I got my own PC, and ever since that I haven't worried about other people ruining my computer(s).
<br />
<br />If that isn't an option, set up a sandbox and a virtual machine and instruct the people you share the computer with on how/when to use them.

<br />
<br />Every day my computer is exactly the way it was a year ago when I set it up.  I have a folder with program installers if I need to put something on temporarily.  If I want to install something permanently I can "thaw" it, do what I need, and freeze it again.  I don't know if I ever get infected with viruses and I don't care, because every restart means I'm clean again.

<br />That's basically the same thing I do with virtual machines, but a little more extreme. I'd actually like to try DeepFreeze, but The problem is that it appears to be quite pricey, while VirtualBox is free.
<br />
<br />For a while now I've been cutting back on the amount of pirated software I use, favoring free applications whenever possible (for example, I replaced Nero with ImgBurn, Photoshop with GIMP, CorelDraw with Inkscape, VMWare with VirtualBox, MSOffice with OpenOffice, WinRAR/WinZIP with 7-Zip, and some of them are actually better than what I used before, and not nearly as bloated). So even if DeepFreeze can be pirated easily, I'm not sure I'd be willing to.

<br />A free alternative for Windows XP computers is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=d077a52d-93e9-4b02-bd95-9d770ccdb431" class="postlink">Microsoft's SteadyState.</a>  I don't think they've made a version for 7 yet.

<br />
<br />I really agree, Tokumaru. Norton programs might as well be a bunch of Viruses and Malware, I tried it and all I got is crap, Might as well try to sue thier asses! But until time comes, too powerful to even do that.
<br />
<br />In other words, I've found Avast! Antivirus to be quite safe and useful at home. And it works on Windows 7 64-bit!
