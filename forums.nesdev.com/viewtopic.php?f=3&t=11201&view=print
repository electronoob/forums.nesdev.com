		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am currently working on a NES emulator. This is my first emulator in general. Working already some time on it.<br />It is in the state that it becomes a bit usefull.<br /><br />Currently emulating:<br /><br />* 6502 CPU<br />* 2A03 APU (Sampling up to 192kHz, but 96kHz downto 44.1kHz recommended, 192kHz strains apu emulation too much)<br />* NES PPU ( still not happy about it, performance wise )<br />* VRC6 extended audio (Castlevania 3 JP version, Esper Dream 2 - Aratanaru Tatakai and Mouryou Senki Madara)<br />* Mapper support list: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5(partially), 7, 8, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 31, 34, 44, 52, 69, 71, 73, 85, 87<br />* Image enhancement filters: 2xSAI, Super 2xSAI, 2xBRZ, 3xBRZ, 4xBRZ, TV Scanline 50/75/75SR, Blargg NTSC, Doubler and Tripler.<br />* GPU acceleration thru Direct2D<br />* Loading and saving of gamestates ( still needs bug fixing, sometimes you have to load a state 5 a 6 times due PPU issues, needs looking into )<br />* Rewind emulation in steps of 5 seconds. Able to go back up to 100 seconds.<br />* Write APU logs<br />* Write APU Wave<br />* Loads really fast. ( got that goin' )<br />* Play considerable amount of NSFs<br />* AVI recording / on the fly encoding.<br />* Game Controllers (Gamepads, WIImote, etc)<br />* 1:1 / 8:7 aspect ratio.<br />* Very little PAL nes support. It does something but don't expect it to work perfectly.<br />* Phosphor lag emulation.<br />* 60 -&gt; 30 fps pulldown for AVI recording also 30 fps (frameblend) option is available!<br /><br />Current issues:<br /><br />* Very little PAL support.<br />* No Lightgun support. (can't figure that one out)<br />* Pausing emulation doesn't pause audio (sorry for that, repeating samplebuffer issue, should be easily fixed, but very low priority) &lt;-- still not fixed @ 10-02-2015 (02-10-2015 american)<br /><br />Included in the file:<br /><br />* The emulator itself<br />* The &quot;dropped&quot; project.. The emulator for developers ( no waaaaay done yet... should not use it )<br />* My &quot;NSF&quot; player firmware routine for my emulator. (Folder resources)<br />* My &quot;NSF&quot; player source code for my emulator (Folder &quot;Resources - Source&quot;)<br /><br />Any ideas about it will be greatly appreciated. This is project for me too learn the innards of computing in general. I have to say.. It sounds easy to emulate/simulate a NES but it actually far from it.

It deserves mention because it's remarkable how many people screw this up.  Edit: Oh, I take that back, it does have tearing but in a very bizarre way and very gradual, but it's still tolerable.  You might be limited by SDL in this regard, so no hard feelings.

I do use SDL for audio, but not for display. for Display I use GDI ( worst case scenario ) or direct2d (Not D3D, OGL)<br />maybe I would implement these later on. but for now.. I stick with D2D graphics as GPU acceleration option.<br /><br />This means that accelerated options  (and therefore proper vSYNC) is only supported with Windows 7 or higher. sorry bout that <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />With windows XP it probably will fallback to GDI with framerate syncronisation at precise 60fps. if your display does 59.9995 hz or something like that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks,<br /><br />I have really looked into the audio of the NES.. Playing a lot of NES captured videos for sound. I have the DPCM samples in tune now (Rounding errors). But now I have small popping noises through my audio output. Therefore I will completely revise the APU code. Right now I use approximation logic. So that I don't have to fully compute the APU on a clock-to-clock base. But it seems this won't do as the aliasing/popping and out-of-tune.. Especially in low sample rates (lower sample rate means more approximation logic) @ 96000Hz it becomes alot better.<br /><br />Still revising as it is.<br /><br />Still trying to get Kickle Cubicle to run. Still don't know why this game hangs. Been debugging it for hours.. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> ( tracing execution step-to-step, It just goes from subroutine to subroutine to subroutine, pffff )<br /><br />To return a favor:<br />It seems your emulator has timing issues with Ducktales I (sprite #0 shows too much, and the glitch above the statusbar when walking around isn't visible. It shows on a real NES though) and especially with Shalom.. Artifacts due to timing errors in the track.<br /><br />And about the B, A default button mappings. That is just the way I prefer it.. I am used having the 'B' button next to my d-pad. As it is mirrored on my keyboard. I default configured it to still be next to the &quot;d-pad&quot; <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Maybe when the emulator becomes really compatible and all the kinks are being worked out. i might implement Direct3D / OpenGL renderers.<br /><br />Got Kickle to run. Yay that is something. Had IRQ emulation issues. Fixed that though. Most of the problem games are.... Still problematic, but Kickle runs. And I did not see any glitches or some kind. It ran without hiccups. Therefore I don't see what mistake I made with the mmc3 characterbanking.
