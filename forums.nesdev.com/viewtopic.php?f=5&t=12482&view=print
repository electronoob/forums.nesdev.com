		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So let me get this straight:<br /><br />Two companies relating to the Arduino device are fighting because they both want to be called Arduino. Company A is the original developers of the device, and Company B was originally the largest manufacturer of the devices, and then bought out by someone who previously co-developed one flavor of the device, and renamed to &quot;Arduino&quot;.<br /><br />Both companies are/were trying to sue the other over trademark infringement (I'd be pretty mad too if my manufacturer started selling their own stuff under my name without my permission, and obviously my manufacturer would want to force me to change my name so they could effectively steal my market), and now the Arduino IDE (developed by, I'm assuming, Company A) spits out a non-fatal warning (&quot;Hey be careful this is an uncertified manufacturer&quot;) when you try to flash a device that comes from Company B (whose USB VID is 0x2A03), but doesn't spit out warnings for the dozens of other counterfeit Arduinos.<br /><br />While this is going on, both companies have different plans for the devices and are taking them in their own directions. So, two different companies both called &quot;Arduino&quot;, designing two different versions of the same device with two different philosophies, while each company is trying to stomp the other one out.<br /><br />What a queer situation, I wonder how it'll turn out?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />They're able to do it because it's not against the law for two companies to have the same name. However, there is a clear case of market confusion happening here since the two companies are producing the same products and fighting each other to be the &quot;real&quot; Arduino, leading to things like the IDE warning described in the article. In this case, the companies can press charges and it's up to the court to figure out who's right.<br /><br />Since the second company was bought out by someone who previously worked with the first company, it doesn't seem like an innocent coincidence that he later changed the name of his company to the same thing and started producing strikingly similar products. I think the courts are going to side with the original Arduino company, and not the name-changed Arduino company.

(and some below.) I really don't think it's that fair to group ASM with all the other programming languages, because I'd say it's the only (well, aside machine code) &quot;true&quot; programing language. Sure, it isn't machine code level, but you have full control of what you're doing, and need to know the hardware inside out. (I couldn't even imagine changing pointers in machine code, because if you had to add a register in between two things, you might as well start over.) The only real advantage I see to higher level &quot;programming languages&quot; is that it is easy to port your game or project, but the code won't be as good as if you wrote it with that platform in mind. I kind off don't see why there's so much distaste towards asm. I know it gets the product out the door faster, but people always seem to complain it's &quot;too difficult&quot;. Many people who like to program games as a hobby even don't want to use ASM, and there's no time limit. I just think it's funny how many times people have talked about using C on the NES or SNES, when, like I said, It's for fun, and I just don't see the fun in using C.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Also FAMI.com: Farmers Alliance Mutual Insurance</div><br /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> (It's funny how oblivious people can be, but I don't think farmers know too much about 30+ year old Japanese video games. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> )

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />People hate assembly because you have to code in a way that's different from high level languages, which is what most people learn first and moving to a lower level language typically means &quot;ugh, more work&quot;, making it an unattractive option. You have to explicitly write every opcode instead of relying on &quot;macros&quot; like &quot;(var + othervar) * 3&quot;, and memory management is done completely manually instead of just saying &quot;int blah&quot; and not having to worry about free space. It's likely that these are the same people who detest using pointers so much in C/C++, which unsurprisingly is a glimpse into a lower level way of coding. It also doesn't help that usually the first thing people hear w.r.t. assembly is &quot;oh ugh I hate assembly&quot;, so they basically hate it before they've even touched it.<br /><br />Regarding Arduino, people who use Arduino and are never going to learn &quot;proper&quot; microcontroller coding are people who were never going to learn it in the first place; the device isn't holding them back, they're holding themselves back. That doesn't stop there being a whole generation of inexperienced coders throwing stuff into the market though; I have similar rants about indie games.
