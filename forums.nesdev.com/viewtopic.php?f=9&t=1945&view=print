		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have an older (non-clone) Famicom system that I don't know if it is powering up or not.  I have a Super Famicom system that works just fine with the same rf/power supply on channel 95/96 so I know that's not the problem.  I would like to know if anyone knows of another way to test to see if the system is powering up such as adding a led as the system does not have one.  Any input on this would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

If it can't take AC or got fried from wrong polarity you could try replacing the regulator (7805) in there.
<br />
<br />You could also use a voltmeter between VCC/GND in there and see if it's got voltage when it's switched on.

<br />
<br />SFC/NTSC SNES only runs on DC too (no rectifier, but it does have a protection diode which the Famicom does not have stuffed.)
<br />
<br />NES/PAL SNES has a rectifier so it can take AC or DC.

<br />The camera doesn't even capture how intense and rich blue the new LED shows up as, but it's pretty nice.
<br />
<br />My question is though, is there a resistor on down the line somewhere?  One would think there would be, to keep from burning out the red one, but based on how bright the new one shows up, despite it being an ultrabright version, I thought I better ask before I take a chance on burning it out.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A system that accepts AC is much more resistant to being fried, because it can almost always accept DC of either polarity, and almost always will have a voltage regulator after the rectifier, allowing a wide voltage range. A system that accepts DC needs the right polarity or things could get damaged. They usually have a voltage regulator as well, since it allows using a cheaper unregulated wall transformer.

<br />For a long time I used a modified SNES power supply for my NES. I had added an extra plug that fit the NES, so I could have just one power supply that worked for the NES, SNES, and even Sega Genesis (but powering more than one at once didn't work well, heh). Recetly when I was testing a PAL NES, this DC power supply didn't work well at all. There was an awful hum. I tried several other DC power supplies but none worked. Once I gave in and used a proper AC power supply, the hum was gone.

<br />With the series resistor connected to the LED, connecting it wrong won't screw anything up permanently. Pretty much if you experiment connecting it in various ways around the power switch, once it appears to work right it'll be working right.

<br />
<br />lol it's true, it lights up the room enough with the lights out to see where you're going.  My PC has a similarly bright blue in the ring around the power button.  But neither sit in a position to be of distraction when in use, luckily.  And in the case of the NES, I could probably slip the LED back out of the plastic light channel thing and point it straight up, which would lessen the intensity a lot I'd bet.
<br />
<br />
<br />Anyhoo, I didn't realize it at the time, but I guess it was pretty rude to hijack the topic with my own mostly unrelated question.  Sorry about that, silkd!

<br />I have the same power adaptator for my NES and SNES, as well as the same AV output, and I didn't modify anything here. I just think american users got different power adaptators, wile european users got the same.

<br />Hey silkd, the second post, the one by Calpis explains how to install the led.  Super simple...just 4 soldering points.

<br />
<br />I would test the power at the voltage regulator (7805, 3-pin thing connected to a heatsink of some sort).  First pin (near the dot) is the input voltage, that should read as what the DC input is from the power adapter.  Middle pin is GND, 3rd pin is output voltage which should be around 5V.  If you get different results, put in a new 7805.  As far as the power supply, if the previous owner mis-used it the 7805 would be the first (and only?) thing to go.  Also check for damaged/exploded capacitors near the regulator.
