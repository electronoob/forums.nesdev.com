<br />So are those undumpable SPCs possible to get dumped or is there no chance? I know that there's SNSF files but there aren't any for the ones I want (James Bond Jr., Paperboy 2, Wayne's World)
<br />
<br />EDIT: Not sure if I mentioned this before but I went through and completed the godawful lightgun game from MegaSoft called Master Shooter and it credits G2 and Tommy Shih for the music. Could Tommy Shih be the real name of Martino, Melody or Ruth? The world may never know.
<br />And I didn't see the full names of the composers for Werewolf so let me put them down: Shogo Sakai, Takafumi Miura and Yusuke Takahama. I also didn't see the composer for Burgertime listed so let me put it down here: Tokinori Kaneyasu.
<br />Also:
<br />Flinstones 1 - Y. Yamada, N. Yagashita
<br />Flinstones 2 - S.Takahagi, Masafumi Ogata
<br />Tecmo NBA Basketball - Paul Webb, The Fat Man (George Sanger).

<br />
<br />Cool World - Jonathan Dunn (ROM text. Currently I don't have a staff roll to work with for this game. The SNES version is missing a composer because there's nothing under the audio category in the staff roll.)

<br />And what does a company suing another have anything to do with you enjoying a game? Nothing that happens can possibly modify the games you already own and like.

<br />It's true that customs for In The Groove arcade machines completely made the arcade as "Open Sourced" as it could get, but with In The Groove 3 being cancelled while it was close to completion and not having any other company that seemed to care so much towards the players, and how people felt about the game, Konami bought the franchise to prevent it from getting any better.
<br />So what does Konami do? 
<br />Why they make more and more awful home versions of the same game whipped together with some awfully made remixes of Pop music.

<br />After <em>Konami v. Roxor</em> went down, there was mumbling among the community about possible suits against the StepMania developers and people who make simfile packs, but I guess in five years that hasn't materialized.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just got another game's credits:<br />J League Winning Goal credits Shige Chan and Yoko Chan, which are the aliases of Shigenori Masuko and Yoko Suzuki. I beat J League Fighting Soccer but there is no credits. The GameBoy version credits Fumito Tamayama but I think the GB version has different music, so I think Masuko and Suzuki are possible composers of it. I asked Fumito Tamayama if he composed those GRC games that didn't have credits but he never got back to me. (He has an account on the Project2612 forums.) Also, Predator I believe may have been composed by Junichi Saito. He has been credited on a lot of the Pack-In-Video games that happen to have credits.<br /><br />I have found out the composer of the Lolo games and a few others.<br />All the Lolo games were composed by Hideki Kanazashi. In Eggerland he's credited as 'Zap Ajisai', in Meikyuu no Fukkatsu, he's credited as 'Nige no Kanazashi' (translate anyone?) and the NSF for Othello doesn't credit him, but he's in there credited as 'Rodeo Kanagushi'. I believe he also composed Joust, Millipede and Defender II. Also, seeing all the composers at Graphic Research, Fumito Tamayama may not have composed Asmik Kun Land, or at least, not alone. Hiroto Kanno, Shigenori Masuko, Shinji Tachikawa, Yoko Suzuki, and Tinpu Uchibori are also possible composers. I asked Fumito if he composed the game but he never replied. When I recorded the MP3 soundtrack, I just put the artists down as Fumito Tamayama, Shigenori Masuko and Yoko Suzuki.<br />Also, F-15 Strike Eagle's manual credits Ken Lagace, and some of the music in that game is also used in F-117A Stealth Fighter. If that doesn't convince you that Ken Lagace composed that, he confirmed it for me, too.<br /><br />Oishinbo (Japan only) is composed by Michiharu Hasutani. I beat the game and it doesn't have credits, but I am planning on buying the game CIB on eBay. It uses Hasuya's instruments. All the songs in the game, as far as I know, are real songs, but I don't know the names of them. If someone knows their names, please let me know.<br /><br />Update: 12/30/11 - I see that Boulderdash's NSF credits 'Victor Musical Industries'. The game has credits and it says that Yusuke Takahama, Takafumi Miura, and Shogo Sakai are the composers, so update your NSFs!<br /><br />Update: 1/3/12 - Happy new year everyone! Last year, I played through a bunch of Sachen games that were known to have credits, but the composers were not in the NSFs. Most of the pictures of the credits can be found at the VGMPF Wiki under the Game Credits section. I also got a hold of Dan Lawton, founder of Color Dreams, and he told me Vance Kozik did the Wisdom Tree games' music.<br />Bible Adventures - Vance Kozik<br />Cobra Mission - Vincent Cheng<br />Exodus: Journey to the Promised Land - Vance Kozik<br />Gaiapolis - Chou Yuan-Hei<br />Hell Fighter - Lih-Chyun Maa, Mr. X<br />King Neptune's Adventure - John Dwyer<br />King of Kings: The Early Years - Vance Kozik<br />Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf - Aran Lee Shige<br />Magical Tower - Amadeus Y. Wang<br />Menace Beach/Sunday Funday - Vance Kozik<br />Mermaids of Atlantis/Bubble Bath Babes - Kossel Huang<br />Olympic IQ - Richard<br />Operation Secret Storm - Dan Lawton told me 'Sandy Sims' isn't a real person. Possibly an alias for John Dwyer.<br />Orb 3D - Peter Stone (May have mentioned this before, but if not, here it is.)<br />Parodius - Hiroshi Takeyasu, Tomoya Tomita (Credited only last names)<br />Puzzle - B.H. Ting?<br />Q-Boy - Yuan Mei Chou (I actually contacted this guy)<br />Raid 2020 - Dan Burke, Frank Waung<br />Robodemons - Dan Burke<br />Rockball - (Apparently this one's supposed to have credits, but I beat the game and didn't get any)<br />Silver Eagle - Amy Chou, Amadeus Wang<br />Super Pang - Amy Chou, L.K.C.<br />Tagin' Dragon - Rolland Cheng<br />Touchdown Fever - Tarkun, Niko-Chan Yoko<br />Worm Visitor - Amadeus L Wang, Ei How Yang<br /><br />Update 4/30/12 - Today, you guys will know all the composers behind the Graphic Research games. I recently got in touch with Fumito Tamayama. He had some interesting things to say and he was able to recall the composers for the NES games which didn't have credits (Asmik Kun Land and J League Fighting Soccer):<br />Asmik Kun Land - Manabu Ito<br />Baken Hisshou Gaku: Gate In - Fumito Tamayama<br />Baseball Fighter - Fumito Tamayama<br />J League Fighting Soccer - Yoko Suzuki<br />J League Winning Goal - Shigenori Masuko, Yoko Suzuki<br />Secret Ties - Fumito Tamayama<br />Widget - Shinji Tachikawa, Fumito Tamayama, Tinpu Uchibori, Yuji Suzuki<br />Vegas Connection - Hiroto Kanno, Mai Kidokoro<br /><br />Update 5-7-12<br />I have recently talked to former Kemco▲Seika programmer Hiroyuki Masuno, and he has verified for creating the music to all of the Kemco▲Seika games, so update your NSFs with Hiroyuki Masuno:<br />The Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout<br />The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle<br />Deja Vu<br />Kid Klown (Composer: M. Takenaka, Hiroyuki credited as Sound Performer)<br />North &amp; South (With Y.Kawikame?) [kingshriek please verify this]<br />Shadowgate<br />Snoopy's Silly Sports Spectacular<br />Spy Vs Spy<br />Spy Vs Spy - Island Caper<br /><br />Update 1-4-13<br />Motor City Patrol and Noah's Ark - Chris Gill (Sound Driver programmed by Link Tomlin)
