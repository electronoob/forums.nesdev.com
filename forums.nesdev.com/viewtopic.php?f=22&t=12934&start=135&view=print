		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been playing around with two alternate versions of Nova the Squirrel in the background, which might get more focus if there's interest.<br /><br />Firstly I want to do a proper PAL version, with game speeds adjusted. In that version, I extended the 12.4 fixed point up to 12.12 so I could increase speeds by 20% more precisely, and I've managed to get jumping very close to NTSC. I would imagine most people in Europe would rather just play the better version, but when I eventually do a cart release I think a proper PAL-fixed version is important.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />Secondly, I'm doing a more generic version of the engine (Princess Engine), intended as an &quot;easy&quot; starting point for more open source platformer games, with a level editor ready to go and designed for expansion.<br /><br />I've been replacing assets with placeholder ones, and I want to do things like replace the level select with a SMB3-style or MC Kids-style world map. It would also be a good idea to make it support more music engines, though I do want Pently to be just as easy to use as Famitone.<br /><br />I sort of feel like most people would rather do something from scratch or use NES Maker, though. The main advantage my engine has is it's already designed around extra RAM, so levels can be as destructible as you want, with backtracking. You can also flip a switch and convert it to MMC3 if you want scanline interrupts or a 512KB ROM.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />While I haven't started on it, part of me wants to try porting the game and/or engine to SNES. I'd probably want to add SMW features (slopes, two screen tall levels, more block types).<br /><br />It'd be cool to have it there as an open source SMW alternative, and I would want to enhance the engine to support important SMW features (slopes, two-screen-tall levels). But SMW already has a whole community and years of work and resources put into it, and my only advantages (open source level editor, all game code commented and available, legal to distribute) aren't that much. There would probably still be people who'd want it here, though.<br /><br />I think it'd be a great idea to have a SNES version just to contribute a new homebrew game to the SNES library, though.

World 2 could be properly translucent and glassy, World 3 could have a proper background that doesn't disappear around the edges of things, etc. It would be a lot less work than making a SNES game from scratch because I'd be able to reuse maybe 90% of the code and all of the game and level design.<br /><br />It would still be sort of a longterm-ish project though, because lots of things would need to be redone or remade. I think I'm gonna get the NES standalone engine out of the way first.<br /><br />A minor extra thing would be that everyone would be playing with a SNES controller, instead of just the few people who have adapters or people who know to select a SNES controller in Mesen or FCEUX.

If that proposal gets accepted and an entry is added for a regular SNES controller I'll set that field whenever the next build is. Still just a minor convenience since my solution with Up+B and Down+B in place of extra face buttons works well in practice.

It's not like a mouse or a zapper where you would want a &quot;regular&quot; controller next to it. If player 2 doesn't use the extra buttons, no harm done.

Who knows?<br /><br />Some users make crappy low quality hacks, others make masterpieces. Some hackers don't care if their game runs on original hardware, other hackers do. It's all about the intent of the hacker. <br /><br />I don't think Nintendo is really going to crack down on hacks, because the hacker does have some rights to their work in the form of the patch. When Nintendo was taking down hack videos on youtube that was because they were going to release their new product, Super Mario Maker and they didn't want the public getting confused between hacks and their own program to make custom levels. <br /><br />If you have a SNES editor that is 100% legal for people to make legit games out of then people can release their works on Steam and such. Currently you can't release your Super Mario World rom hack on Stream and earn profits off of it as far as I understand. <br /><br />The only real way to know if people are interested in your SNES homebrew engine is to make it and see if it gains a following. Who knows what the future holds. But I do know one thing........ if you build it......... they will come!!!

They were taking down everything they could (automatically) identify as their games. They had this Nintendo partnership system that was really stupid for whitelisting people who were allowed to stream their games. Hacks were often caught by their content detection methods, but it was difficult in general to upload normal footage of SMB/SMW to YouTube too.<br /><br /><em>Edit:</em> Though, <a href="https://r.ncp.nintendo.net/" class="postlink">Nintendo's partnership program</a> does have a policy of no ROMhacks, so maybe you are right to say they have something special against hacks, just it's part of a more general policy of asserting ownership and approval right over all footage of their games in general.
