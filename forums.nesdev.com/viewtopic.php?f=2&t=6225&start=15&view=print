<br />
<br />I'd have to disagree with doing that. You seem to be forgetting that the game running on emulator gives it almost complete cross-platform compatibility with todays devices. A NES emulator runs perfect on Playstation Portable, Playstation 1, Xbox,Wii, Nintendo DS, my random phone I bought from China.

<br />As for mobile phones, I live in the United States. In this country, unless one of the big four carriers (Verizon, Sprint, AT&amp;T, or T-Mobile) has a phone in stock, only a commercially insignificant number of people will know about it. And they tend not to carry MeeGo phones.

I have no clue about XNA, seems to be Microsoft stuff so I'd assume it's involves some "trusted computing" type of crap in it somewhere.  But the emulated NES game will run on almost anything.  There sure won't be any platform-related crap like "runtime version v34.53.645 required", as well has these phones AFAIK having completely different chipsets meaning you have to write music / draw graphics without being able to properly use any special features that might be available on a given device (resulting in the game looking/sounding like crap compared to what else is available).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Playstation 1</div><br />Not without a modchip.

<br />Actually it looks like you can buy a flash cart + a small memory card for maybe $5 altogether.  You could probably even reflash the boot memory, epoxy the memory card in, label it, and it's now an original cart made of commonly available materials.  Seems pointless to bother with getting Nintendo's approval for something that would only need sell a couple hundred copies to be successful (or whatever ones own metric for success is, I guess).

<br />Nintendo has been getting better at getting various countries' customs departments to seize flash carts. And a lot of flash carts don't work on DSi because DSi firmware checks pre-DSi DS games against a whitelist and post-DSi DS games against an RSA signature on the cart.

I mean if one wanted to be discreet about it, just make the PIC code-protected it and call it a free bonus LED flasher.

The other solution is including a gameshark-like cartridge with the CD.  Those were very handy and clones used to be around for like $5 each, maybe not as common now though.

<br />
<br />Yeah I'd believe that, I wouldn't feel to comfortable ordering a whole crapload of them at once.  I'm sure if you could get them without all the annoying packaging (just the bare carts) no one would notice anything about it.
