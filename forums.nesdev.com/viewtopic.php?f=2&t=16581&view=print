		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So far I've only been using the default mapper, but I want to try using MMC3. I read the relevant wiki articles but I can't get anything to work. It will compile, but the resulting rom just produces a blank screen in the emulator. The identical code works just fine with the default mapper. It's not doing anything fancy, just writing some colors to the palette to make sure it works.<br /><br />So I guess what I'm looking for is a sort of &quot;quick setup template&quot; for getting something (anything) running using MMC3. For example:<br /><br /><ul><li>What do I put in the header?</li><li>Where should my code start?</li><li>Is there something special I need to do at the start of the reset code to get things set up? If so, does that need to happen before or after the usual initialization code (waiting to power up etc)?</li></ul><br />Thanks!

It's served me perfectly well with the default mapper.<br /><br />Upon opening the file in a hex editor, it appears to be only $2000 in size to begin with, and everything after about $00A8 or so is just completely filled with 00s.

Since your file is only 8 KiB, it seems safe to assume that FCEUX is loading garbage for the remainder of the file. Maybe try starting off with just your known-working NROM bit and <em>just</em> change the mapper number to 4 so that you can reduce the number of variables.<br /><br />Since you now specify 64 KiB of PRG, you need to put the reset handler starting at 56 KiB into the file. I'm not sufficiently versed in ASM6 to know how to do that...
