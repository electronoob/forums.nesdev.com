<br />just need the team,
<br />
<br />it does not have to be developed from scratched but use the structure of other games like parallel worlds 9if legally possible)

<br />
<br />I'm not trying to rain on anybody's parade, but this sort of topic pops up from time to time (maybe more commonly on other forums), and nothing ever comes of it. Most people who can do something productive shy away from working on ambitious projects started by strangers when nothing is shown up front. If you want people to even so much as respond, post links to past projects, a detailed outline or plan for your project, or at the very least some proposals.

<br />What an honorable mentality.... (hironical)
<br />
<br />You definitely doesn't have the same definition of "serious" as I have.
<br />
<br />Back on topic I'd say build a team to make a game is not a bad idea, considering most people who wants to make games all by themselves more often than not get stuck and stop making any progress on their incomplete games.
<br />
<br />I think another factor for this is that assembly language is simply long, complex to deal with and unsuited for big projects.
<br />Is there a way to make CC65 compile C code for the 65816 ?
<br />
<br />Also it'd be good to know what genre of game you are talking about... because from your original post it could be basically anything.
<br />It's legally possible to re-use concepts behind games of course, as long as you don't steal the code itself.

So you could make a game in C on SNES I imagine. Probably not well suited for anything too demanding since the CPU isn't terribly fast and who knows how optimized the C code would be, ofcourse you might be able to figure out how to write your C code optimally enough for it not to be an issue.

<br />
<br />Lint is who you are talking about, since I was talking with him and Memblers about Lint's CA65 port of Memblers NSF player for SNES.
<br />
<br />Although he said to me that he will post it on his blog, appears he is too busy since 2008 (Collage, Getting a job, etc.)
<br />
<br />Even then, The C compiler he uses is WDC's C compiler with Eclipse. A bit expensive though

<br />
<br />I do, and the answer is "not a whole lot". I ended up writing my own assembly level peephole optimizer since I've used tcc-816 (snes-sdk) quite a lot and the code generated by the compiler simply wasn't good enough IMO.
<br />Of course, the proper approach would be to fix the compiler, but that would be a bigger project.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />ok, guys
<br />
<br />yes I know nothing about programming, that is why im looking for a team.
<br />
<br />All i can offer to this project is, Digital design, marketing, public relations, story boards, character design, anything that has to do with the creative aspects..
<br />This game how I picture it and how I would love it to be
<br />
<br />- Long, I love when I buy a game and I dont finish it right away
<br />
<br />- The main idea of the games is kind of act raiser + megaman + Breath of fire
<br />   - platformer (action) 
<br />   - Bit of RPG battles and experience Level Up
<br />   - RPG map when walking from mission to mission
<br />   - Some puzzle (like zelda) on some "missions"
<br />
<br />If the game is successfully done (far future) I will try my best to push it into other games market (wii store, Xbox marketplace, May be even android )
<br />
<br />and of course manufacture the game for SNES
