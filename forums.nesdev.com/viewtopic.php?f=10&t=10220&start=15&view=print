I wonder if the MMC3 IRQ timing isn't wrong in that emulator.<br /><br />Now you guys are making me doubt it ever worked in FCEUX!!! Seriously though, I remember it working there, but I think I used a sprite 0 hit to time the effect, not an IRQ. I could be wrong though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some preliminary debugging has led me to believe that this is a problem with the timing of the MMC3 IRQ. Look at the pattern tables and you'll see that sprites tiles are on the left and background tiles on the right, the opposite of what's normal in MMC3 games. The scanline counter in the MMC3 is very picky, and if you break its rules it can fire at different times or behave erratically. My guess is that FCEUX does not emulate the alternate counting that results from inverting sprites and backgrounds, and fires at the usual time. This screws up the timed code that follows, which is supposed to make the last 2 PPU writes happen at the start of HBlank. I'm not 100% sure this is the problem, but it's my best guess so far.<br /><br />EDIT: <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC3" class="postlink">Here's</a> some reference about about MMC3 IRQ timing:<br /><div class="quotetitle">NESDEV Wiki wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If the BG uses $0000, and the sprites use $1000, then the IRQ will occur after PPU cycle 260 (as in, a little after the visible part of the target scanline has ended).<br />If the BG uses $1000, and the sprites use $0000, then the IRQ will occur after PPU cycle 324 of the previous scanline (as in, right before the target scanline is about to be drawn).</div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I debugged some more and it appears that the IRQ fires too soon in FCEUX. By the time the your IRQ handler starts (i.e. the code at $C38C), FCEUX is around PPU cycle/pixel 306, while Nintendulator is around cycle 11 of the next scanline. Quite a big difference, enough to have your PPU writes that should take place during HBlank happening too soon.<br /><br />Since, according to the wiki, the correct behavior would be for the NMI to fire at cycle 324, FCEUX is obviously in a hurry. Nintendulator on the other hand, appears to be correct, considering that the IRQ can happen in the middle of an instruction (which has to finish before the IRQ can be serviced) and that the CPU needs some time (7 cycles?) to actually enter the IRQ routine, cycle 11 of the next scanline sounds about right (3 cycles of a possible unfinished instruction + 7 cycles to enter the IRQ handler = 10 CPU cycles = 30 PPU cycles; 324 + 30 = 354; since each scanline is 341 PPU cycles long, 354 - 341 = 13).<br /><br />So now that you know for sure that the problem is in FCEUX, you have to make a decision: will you try to fix the problem? If yes, I'd suggest you switch the sides of the sprite and background tiles, use the standard MMC3 configuration and adjust the timing of the PPu writes according to that configuration, to see if FCEUX agrees with the other emulators in that case.<br /><br />You can obviously chose to ignore the problem, because you know it's nothing wrong with your software. But if you ask me, it's important to know WHY something is not behaving as expected, to make sure the problem is not in your work.

I flipped the CHR Bank data, switched the $2000 Tile Patterns bits, and added NOPs to the new HBlank.  FCEUX remains with the same exact action but the glitch at the split is now gone from that emulator and Nestopia/Nintendulator still work properly.<br /><br />I don't see anything strange in my code but maybe someone else will spot something.

I found that pretty weird, but it only appears to happen in version 2.2.1, in version 2.2.0 there was only a small glitch at the end of the scanline where the split happens.
