<br />
<br />I'm running Photoshop CS5. It would be great if i could use this program as i'm very familiar with it. I've read various threads and searched around, and again it does seem like it is possible to use Photoshop, but there seem to be varying opinions on it.
<br />
<br />I've seen a number of specialised programs, but a lot of them are for PC, and they all seem quite tricky for a noob like me to use.
<br />
<br />Again, i have a lot of questions relating to graphics, but firstly i guess i just need to know, am i currently in a position to get going?
<br />
<br />Thanks again, and sorry for being a complete noob <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />There are two ways to make NES graphics.
<br />
<br />You can make it in a specialized editor that will check all the limitations automatically, not allowing you to draw anything that couldn't be displayed on NES. Downside is that these specialized editors are usually very limited compared to normal graphics editor, i.e. it is just difficult to work with them.
<br />
<br />You can make graphics in any normal graphics editor, keeping NES limitations in mind (colors per tile, palettes, attributes), then convert it with a specialized tool. This way you will be able to do major part of work in a comfortable tool.
<br />
<br />I personally use both ways, depending from complexity of the graphics.
<br />
<br />I don't know about specialized tools for Mac, though, but you always can use Windows tools through Wine, and there was a tile editor in Java, forgot its name.

<br />
<br />So it sounds like a combination of both might be the way to go? I'm definitely used to Photoshop so perhaps i should start there.
<br />
<br />In Photoshop is it possible to impose these limitations on yourself? For example setting up a file template for each element you wish to create?
<br />
<br />Also, would it be possible to create something in Photoshop, and then import it into one of these editors you mention as a way of checking that it is drawn correctly?
<br />
<br />Finally, if i was to use a specialised editor and run it in Wine, which one would you say would be good for a complete noob like myself to start with?

<br />
<br />You have to use other tools to convert the graphics to use it on NES, so of course you can use them to check if your graphics is drawn correctly.
<br />
<br />I'm personally use GraphicsGale and sometimes GIMP for complex pixel graphics work. You can do it even with Windows Paint or similar programs, but indexed mode, grid, and layers are very useful for this kind of work.
<br />
<br />As I wasn't satisfied with existing NES graphics tools for Windows, I made my own, <a href="ftp://ftp.untergrund.net/users/shiru/nesst.zip" class="postlink">NES Screen Tool</a>. It works under Wine. There are few others, like <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/108/" class="postlink">Tile Layer Pro</a>, <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/119/" class="postlink">YY-CHR</a>, and more.

<br />
<br />I have a feeling Photshop is going to be a good starting point for me, this way hopefully i can at least get a feel for the basic process, and then perhaps moving on to the other editors you mentioned.
<br />
<br />Bearing in mind that i am a complete noob, where would be a good place for me to start with Photoshop? Lets say i wanted to create an animated sprite for example that was within the correct limitations? What kind of template etc would i have to load up to begin doing this?

<br />
<br />Out of the ~50ish colors in that palette, you have to make 4 sets of 3 colors that are used by the sprites in every given frame that NES renders. Sprites are internally composed of 8x8 or 8x16 blocks, each of which can use one of those 4 sets of colors. You can also overlay several 8x8/8x16 blocks to get more than 3 colors in a 8x8/8x16 area, with the cost of sprite flickering becoming more of an issue.
<br />
<br />I'll let somebody else explain this in more depth. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Do you think it would be reasonable/worthwhile for me to try and make a sprite sheet, and try turning it into a series of animated gifs to get a feel for the limitations, and how a creation might look in motion?

Otherwise it is has pretty standart interface, and once you get used to this mouse layout, it turns out to be very comfortable.
<br />
<br />Another thing that Gale have and many graphics editors aren't is palette management - you can move colors around, arranging them in a certain order, which is very useful for conversion purposes.
<br />
<br />So this editor is certainly deserves some attention. Even if you will do most of work in Photoshop, it could help with specific tasks.

<br />
<br />I did have a random question regarding sprites.
<br />
<br />In the other thread someone mentioned Gremlins 2. I checked that out on YouTube, along with Batman as well, and noticed that the sprites don't <em>seem</em> to adhere to the 8 x 8 limitation. Gremlins 2 (Gizmo) seemed to be in particular, very well animated and made up of a lot of pixels, compared to something like Megaman or Mario (1). 
<br />
<br />What is that's going on here? Or is this a bit beyond me to understand at the moment and i should try and make something 8 by 8 first?

<br />
<br />You can't overcome the scanline limit, though, so if there are situations in your game when more than 64 pixels of sprites could be placed on one scanline, you need to implement the sprite flicker, to make sprites at least somehow visible in these situations. That affects to the game design a lot, as you don't want to have too much flicker and should avoid it by using taller objects and smart placement them on the screen.
