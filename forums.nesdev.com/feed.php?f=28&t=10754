Good call Farid, HxD is what I was looking for.<br /><br />  Unfortunately I'm still confused. Last night I burned a new set of '256 eproms with the original bin images and installed them in my socketed NROM devCart. They showed the same sort of errors. <br />  Then I split the .nes again with the PHP readNES again and burned both a 4x CHS to a 27c256 and a 1x CHR to a 2764 (thinking there might be a issue with the 4x). Switched these CHR roms onto the devCart and both had the tile errors. <br />  Using HxD I compared the old 4x CHR image with the new 4x, and the 4x with the 1x image. All are identical.<br />  Also tested other carts in the NES, they ran flawlessly without having to reseat at all. <br /><br />So:<br />1. Could be a corrupt CHR bin file. The original .nes runs perfect on emu, so could be a bit error introduced during the readNES split. <br /><br />2. Could be a problem with the Willem programmer. <br /><br />3. Could be 4 bad CHR EPROM chips,  3-27c256 and 1-2764<br /><br />4.<br />  A. Both the ReproPak and the re-purposed NROM carts are not making a good connection to the 72 pin; causing the same type of error on both.<br />  B. Both carts have a problem with the installation of CHR eproms. <br />  C. Could be a problem with the 72 pin connector that only effects these two carts.<br /><br />  Of this list, #1 seems like the most likely. Even though the other times I have used the web readNES it had worked fine. Next I'll split the rom with uCON64 and compare the two. I'll also try FCEUX's debug out.<br /> The other possibilities: 2 &amp; 3 seem very unlikely and #4 is only a little more probable. <br />So did I cover the possible causes or is there something else?<br />Yogi<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6258">yogi</a> — Thu Dec 05, 2013 11:11 am</p><hr />

OK I'll load up FCEUX, only been using Nestopia but it doesn't seem to debug. Just hoping that there was a byte-for-byte compare tool, seems like I used one a long time ago.<br />I'm thinking a bad EPROM also; what bakes my head is the Williem verified it. Maybe the chip failed after programming during the install in the socket? Doesn't seem to likely, but IDK.<br />Oh well, off to fire up the burner, Thanks lidnariq<br />Yogi<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6258">yogi</a> — Wed Dec 04, 2013 7:08 pm</p><hr />

If you look at the CHR in a CHR viewer or editor (such as FCEUX or Nintedulator's debuggers, or NESst), is there a pattern to which tiles are damaged? If so, it might be a connection issue.<br /><br />Otherwise, I'd suspect a flaw in the UVEPROM.<br /><br />I don't know of a good windows-friendly file comparer or wotnot. If you dump the CHR back from the UVEPROM and load it in NESst you can visually compare the original and the redump.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Wed Dec 04, 2013 6:35 pm</p><hr />

So I think I already know the answer, but I'll put this out anyway, to get more insight.<br />  Over the weekend, I burned a NROM to eproms and my Willem verified them as good; used 27c256s for both (4xCHR bin). Then I tested them on my socketed cart and the program seemed to work, but thinking back I was too hasty because there were a few bad/wrong tiles that I wrote off to a bad cart edge connection. <br />So today I transferred the eproms to a ReproPak board. The program itself runs fine but the CHR issue with the tiles remains. Maybe 6 or 7 bad tiles that show up at the same spots after a powercycle; so bad data or bad hardware?<br />  What gets me is the Willem verified the eprom as good, I assume it's just a bad device; was a pull from god knows where. Or could this be an issue with the split .nes; I used a web page version of readNES that will pad the bin as needed, <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.kevinselwyn.com/ReadNES/">http://www.kevinselwyn.com/ReadNES/</a><!-- m -->. I've used it before and it seemed to work fine, but I haven't compared the output from two different runs. Can someone recommend a free Hex editor that can compare two bin files?<br />  I'm going to burn the same image to different chips and test on the devCart, a bad bin should be apparent if the errors are the same on both carts.<br />Yogi<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6258">yogi</a> — Wed Dec 04, 2013 5:51 pm</p><hr />
