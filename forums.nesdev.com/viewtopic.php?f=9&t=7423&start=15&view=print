<br />It works well with games with 2MB (16 megabit) or less, because the SRAM is mapped at 200000-3FFFFF.
<br />
<br />Usually, if the game is 2MB or less, in that 200000-3FFFFF space, there's just a mirror or the game at 000000-1FFFFF, so the game ignores it

<br />
<br />The reason it works is because the game doesn't behave oddly. However it is possible for it to do so. It just seems that on the Genesis no one did anything fishy, atleast with official software. On SNES the existing SRAM was often checked as a means of copy protection. Games like Donkey Kong Country (I think), Super Metroid (definite), and Killer Instinct (definite) would check not only if SRAM existed but how much of it is there. If it doesn't match the original cartridge it would give you a screen about don't copy games. 
<br />
<br />Genesis didn't seem to have any such protections in games. However it certainly could have been done.
