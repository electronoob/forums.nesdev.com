I can see the similarities.<br /><br />****<br /><br />I implemented a reliable state machine, now I can schedule PPU writes and time stuff. This will mainly be used for the non interactive parts of the game, like drawing the title screen, high score board, maybe some &quot;cutscenes&quot; too if I get around to it before february.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/PHZht2x.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Now I just need to do opcodes to transition between game states... and actually program the game itself. I also need to stop being lazy and sync nametable writes with its attributes.

I just need to know how many seconds it can possibly take because I want to show a high score table afterwards. If it's not much I'll probably do it, if not I'll combine it with the spiral fill after a certain amount of time.

	</div><br /><br /><br />Edit: doing proper reflection was easier than I thought and making the metasprite touch the solid tile and invert its velocity worked pretty well. <br /><br />I thought that the proper way was to actually get how many pixels penetrated on a solid tile and subtract that in the total displacement in the frame (eg. speed = 3px, moving in X axis makes sprite overlap 1px with solid tile, total displacement = 3px - 1px - 1px (eject edge from tile, then move the same amount of pixels in the reverse direction). If you do this any differently or if you know that my method is flawed, please let me know.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://i.imgur.com/UgpScbd.gif">http://i.imgur.com/UgpScbd.gif</a><!-- m -->

Not to mention that collision with the player's paddle (umbrella) is now heightmapped and sectioned to give better control to the player.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hvOF6zw.gif" alt="Image" /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hLeFlES.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I suppose I can adapt the logic easily to add more angles or actually allow a 90 degree angle (aka UP) but that's not really needed for now. Never saw any paddle-ball game that allowed the player to bounce the ball in a straight line anyway.<br /><br />Tiles, tiles, TILES <em>!</em><br />I also implemented tile durability and I have more types of tiles currently drawn and loaded in the game's logic (but still unused).<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/E28IPBf.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />At the moment I'm seriously considering to scale down my game and go through the path of least resistance due to the compo's deadline. I might just submit a breakout clone since everything that's needed for that is already in place. If the deadline is extended I can continue working on the original concept (1 vs. 1 battles, different enemies, having a shop in between battles where you can buy tiles with points and lay them on your side of the field, puzzle &quot;coffee breaks&quot; similar to Side Pocket's trick shots) but with 3 days remaining this is unattainable.<br /><br />------------------------<br /><br />I loved participating in this competition since before this the only thing I did was program trivial mock games where the most complex thing inside was uploading a screen to the nametable, lacking the drive to push forward when complexity started to increase. I'm proud of what I've accomplished, since this helped me to master many important concepts involved in the creation of a NES game, like PPU update scheduling, collision detection, math, input, indirect jump tables... I also appreciate more how difficult and laborious it is to make a NES (or any other platform) game and polish it. Prior to this compo I'd look at some homebrews released and go &quot;wow what a bad game, why hasn't the dev implemented A B C D E F and made G H I J do X Y Z?&quot;, well, now I know why.<br />So even if I don't make it I think this was far from being a waste of time, and at least in my case I feel like the objective of the competition was a success.

I'm just disappointed that I'm not going to be able to use this video for effect correctly anymore (:P):<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJEmqZcfWJs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJEmqZcfWJs</a><!-- m --><br />&quot;bwahahahah I'm not a game killa hahahahah&quot;<br /><br />Come to think about it, I'm not sure if I can finish the game as I first drafted it to be even if the deadline was extended so no big deal really. I'll just focus in my ブリックブレーカー game for now and do the &quot;full game&quot; for Category 2 <em>if</em> I feel like I can finish it in time for cart inclusion. Here's some footage of the game's current state right now:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://youtu.be/KygvdNaBAV8">https://youtu.be/KygvdNaBAV8</a><!-- m --><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gXh8L8d.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />You probably noticed that it doesn't have any sound. My audio man won't be able to do any arrangements for me (and it's my fault for not asking in advance for them) so it will probably be silent unless I decide to add one of the public domain .ftms I have in my HDD into it.<br />Also, notice that there's a glass object in there (with wrong palette though), I will try to add levels just like the bonus ones I was planning for how the game was originally designed, puzzle maps where you have to get the ball to a target tile without breaking any glass objects. It's just a &quot;if (breaktile(x,y) == TILE_GLASS_SHATTERED) then game_fail()&quot; so I think it might be doable.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">This is looking better and better!

I'll try to improve that later.

Things being at different angles feels commonly accepted for this sort of style. It might even actually add something to the soup, now when i think about it. A little whacky perspectives can go a long way to catch interest.

I also attempted to move them so that they'd break the tile grid somewhat, to signal the dissaray of a pile. To the upper left is some metatile variations made from the same four tiles. To the lower left they are put next to each other. Randomizing metatile content could perhaps work well.<br /><br />I used the same technique when doing the brick walls and power ups blowing up animations for wrecking balls (there were some compromises and decisions, all frames didn't make it into the submission and others got changed. I just lazily took a snapshot that happened to be sitting on my desktop):<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
