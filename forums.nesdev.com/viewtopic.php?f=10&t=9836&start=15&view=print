I added some code to clear the nametables, and found that reading PPUSTATUS affects PPUSCROLL, which I now see is mentioned, but not really explained, in the wiki. Why does PPUSTATUS affect PPUSCROLL? Is this just a flaw in the hardware, or is it actually useful for something?

A first write to PPUSCROLL sets the horizontal position, which is made of a &quot;coarse X&quot; (tile column) and a &quot;fine X&quot; (background delay line length). A second write sets the vertical position, which is made of a &quot;coarse Y&quot; (tile row) and a &quot;fine Y&quot; (scanline within tile). Fine X takes effect immediately, coarse X takes effect at the end of the scanline, and Y takes effect at the start of the next frame.<br /><br />Reading PPUSTATUS ($2002) tells the PPU to treat the next write as a first write.

So to write it, you need to set the latch to a known position. Reading it sets it to 0, or cleared. Then the next write to $2006/$2005 will go to the first position. The next will go to the 2nd position. then the 1st, 2nd, etc.<br /><br />Read the Wiki page on PPU registers for a better understanding.

Some senior engineer at Nintendo was quoted somewhere as saying that the reason the guy who designed the NES (who was allegedly young and inexperienced) pulled it off was because he, unlike the others, didn't know it was impossible. I guess this type of weirdness is excusable in the light of... that.<br /><br />Anyway, just to prove you're not completely wasting your time on me:<br /><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9355745/IMAG0392.jpg" alt="Image" />

The thing is that the PPU has a set of internal registers it uses to access VRAM. When you use $2006/$2007 to write/read to/from VRAM you mess with these registers, but the PPU uses these same registers to read data from VRAM as it renders the image. So every time you're finished using these registers you have to set them to a proper value that will cause rendering to start from the desired location. This is called &quot;setting the scroll&quot;.

The confusion is further compounded when you realise those regs are &quot;officially&quot; labelled PPUSCROLL and PPUADDR.  Even $2000 (PPUCTRL) plays a role.<br /><br />At first glance they appear to be, respectively, a way to control the background X/Y offset (for &quot;scrolling&quot; the playfield/screen) and a way to specify a PPU RAM address that you plan on accessing using $2007.  And for $2000, a &quot;way to select which nametable to use&quot;.  But in reality, all these regs do a <strong>hell</strong> of a lot more under the hood -- and that is what tokumaru is talking about.<br /><br />If you ever feel like learning the &quot;real deal&quot; of how it works, you can read (and you will need to READ it, not skim it!) the below wiki document:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/The_skinny_on_NES_scrolling">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/The_ ... _scrolling</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Warning up front: note that even though I &quot;colourised&quot; the Examples section (because it's really hard to mentally keep track of what bits are going into what internal PPU registers vs. what you're writing to $2005/$2006), I still don't have a 100% grasp on it (meaning I understand that the registers affect the internal PPU registers in such ways, but this is something you often have to keep in mind when writing an actual NES game/program).<br /><br />The official NES/Famicom documents didn't outline any of this.  This is why you'll find most first-generation Famicom games (ex. Battle City, Tennis, Pinball, and many others) being very simple -- none-to-little screen panning, everything looking very &quot;simple&quot;, and so on.  Hard to explain exactly, but I hope you get what I mean.  Now fast forward some years and look at games like Wizards &amp; Warriors*, Ninja Gaiden 2 or 3, Gradius 2 (Famicom), Crystalis, Super Mario Bros 2 and especially 3, and of course Battletoads (that thing is crazy).  As time went on, companies/developers actually figured out how all this nonsense worked.  As with any console, sure, the games generally get better as time goes on, but in the NES/Famicom's case, people appeared to be learning &quot;how&quot; the hardware worked under the hood and benefit greatly from that as time progressed.<br /><br />* = I mention this game because of the status bar at the bottom, where if I remember right, the game changes the PPU palette mid-screen (i.e. outside of VBlank, while the electron gun is actively drawing pixels).  On early NES emulators (including some Nesticle releases), this resulted in mass breakage -- simply because nobody knew how the above registers truly/internally worked.

This is also very noticeable in the music, where late soundtracks are much more advanced than the early ones despite using the exact same hardware (more on-board memory and FamiCom expansion chips disregarded).<br /><br />The game I'm trying to make is going to be very simple in terms of graphics and probably not use scrolling at all, but I still need to know how to use PPUSCROLL, apparently, so, yeah, some knowledge of how reading and writing to one PPU register affects the others is necessary, although I think reading that article in-depth can wait until I want to start doing some serious scrolling.<br /><br />Again, I really appreciate how helpful you all are.
