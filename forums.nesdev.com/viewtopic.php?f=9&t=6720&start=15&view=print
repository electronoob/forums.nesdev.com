It would actually work fine even with two controllers connected, if I used one of the other data input pins exposed on the connector. Basically you'd modify an extension cable to have taps into GND, +5V, Strobe, and D3 or D4 (rather than D0 as currently).
<br />
<br />The ultra-cheap interface works on the built-in serial ports on my Dell Precision 360, and the USB-serial adaptor. The Dell's serial ports are like my Mac's: even when you deassert CTS, it sends around 16 more bytes. With the buffering scheme, 115200 is working excellently, and now flow control only sends 00 bytes to the PC, rather than junk values.
<br />
<br />Ultra-cheap interface (I added an extra resistor for extra protection of the NES input):
<br />
<br /><img src="http://blargg.parodius.com/temp/pc_to_nes2.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />For NES to PC, just connect Strobe output from NES to 220 ohm resistor to Rx and CTS on RS-232 port.
<br />
<br />I also concluded that unless you're going the ultra-cheap way, you might as well use a MAX232. The transistors and resistors would be a mess to do without a board, and they draw current.
<br />
<br />Next, to try having the NES read RTS, so that it can tell whether there's even any data from the PC.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />blargg, flow control sounds really cool, how can all this work using one port?  I never tried using more than tx/rx because there aren't any more wires in the usual controller cables (other than clock).
<br />
<br />Another build option that I didn't consider when I first built these, was to connect it to the NES mainboard's controller connector.  Then you could be free to use any of the data bits, as well as pass the controller harness wires through.  With just 2 IDC connectors to hook up + the needed serial/usb line, this would be an easy-to-install system mod for people, I think.  If there was a way to cut case's plastic cleanly, you could have some kind of panel-mount RS232 connector on the back of the system.. that would look hilarious.
<br />
<br />dwedit: I have a Miracle cable, it's sealed shut pretty well so I don't know what's in it.  I can only see a hint of some green PCB soldermask.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Memblers, the NES Strobe output connects to Rx and Clear To Send on RS-232. That's how it does flow control with only one output. When asserting CTS, I have it assert it for at least 10 bit periods, so that the host interprets it as a $00 byte (or break, since it has no proper stop bit). This is the main downside, but it wouldn't be hard to make the protocol such that it can skip these extraneous bytes on the host side. This also means that when the NES is sending to the host, it will be asserting CTS even though the NES isn't ready to receive, so the host mustn't send any data while the NES is sending since it would get lost.
<br />
<br />I've gotten 115200 working very well now on all three hosts (including a SNES implementation), using the ultra-cheap or usual MAX232 approach. The code buffers input, and allows you to find out whether there's any incoming data. Sending 32KB of data to the NES without any further processing runs at about 9.1 KB/sec. The buffering unfortunately adds some overhead. For a run of code that can process data at full rate and doesn't need flow control, you could get the full 11.52 KB/sec maximum throughput, though you'd have very little time between bytes (around 20 cycles). I'll post plans and code hopefully later today, after I take advantage of this nice day to get outside some.

<br />Awesome, I love this idea! If you put a USB adaptor in, you could even have a standard USB square jack on the back of the NES.
<br />
<br />I happened to have a NES extension cable that connects all pins, so I can try using D3 or D4 for serial data, and have it pass eveything else through to allow two controllers and serial connected at the same time.

If the PC will be getting 00's (I forget what will happen without the stop bit) then it seems similar to xon/xoff flow control, at least in that there will be essentially control bytes needing to be dropped out of the data stream.  That would mess up compatibility, but that's not the case I hope?<br /><br />I remember hearing that many UARTs will keep sending bytes after telling it to stop, like you noticed.  I guess that would be flushing its FIFO buffer, so if it stays under 16 bytes that wouldn't be too bad.<br /><br />The main reason I've been concerned about PICs and a "smart" adapter not being used is because I want it to be compatible with software written with for Squeedo, where an IRQ is used for the UART receiving.  So if one wanted to play the same program on a cart without a UART or IRQ (all of them?), you can just poll (and really, that's just as good).  As long as it's 100% safe and done synchronously, so NMIs, DPCM, SPR-DMA, is not a problem (though at least DPCM can be worked around, as mentioned).<br /><br />Well maybe DPCM would cause a bunch of problems anyways, judging by the way controllers work with it (in a synchronous mode).  That sucks.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I happened to have a NES extension cable that connects all pins, so I can try using D3 or D4 for serial data, and have it pass eveything else through to allow two controllers and serial connected at the same time.</div>
<br />
<br />Actually one thing I've been wondering about, is that these signals also exist on the expansion port.  What are the potential problems or benefits of this (when having any kind of device attached to both ports)?  I guess if nothing else, an RS232/USB mod should be standardized to one of the ports (I'd say #2).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I wore myself out yesterday in the heat, and got bogged down today. Trying to finish this code release. For now I've got a test ROM that checksums any files you send to it: <a href="http://blargg.parodius.com/temp/checksum_file.zip" class="postlink">checksum_file.zip</a>. This assumes a MAX232 or FTDI cable that inverts the signals connected to the second controller port, with Strobe driving Rx and CTS, and D0 connected to Tx; it won't work with the cheap versions posted here. You must use hardware handshaking as well. Send a binary file to it at 115200 bits per second, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, and it updates the total bytes and CRC-32. Once you stop sending for 50 msec or more, it updates the final size and checksum, AND sends the checksum as ASCII back to the PC. You can then send another file as before. Also, this is NOT a demonstration of the transfer speed, as it uses a relatively slow CRC algorithm. I've measured buffered transfer at about 9.6 KB/sec, not that bad compared to the theoretical maximum of 11.52 KB/sec.
<br />
<br />I'm running a 16 MB test file as I write this, should take about an hour. I'm hoping for zero errors. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> 16 MB test took an hour and passed the proper CRC-32. Since the test ROM regularly waits for VBL and updates the current time, and CRC updates take a variable number of clocks, this was a good test.
<br />
<br />And, here is the source code, the demo source and NES ROMs, and some documentation: <a href="http://blargg.parodius.com/nes-code/serial_115200.zip" class="postlink">serial_115200.zip</a>

<br />
<br />I wonder what the fastest theoretical speed for receiving would be with custom hardware. I.e. the code in NES side would be string of something like LDA $4017 and hardware (like a custom PowerPak mapper) would take care of shifting the data and so on (could also calculate checksums and stuff). Would it be something along the lines of 400kbit/s or am I forgetting something? Are there any instructions on 6502 that reads the same address twice that could be utilized to get faster speed? Just a thought.
