<br />Yes the voices samples in FF7 were originally meant to be played at 22050 Hz (half of the PlayStaion's DSP sampling rate).

<br />KH uses the same codec as the Game Boy Advance Video carts. It's compressed: 45 minutes in 32 MB, or about 12 kilobytes per second including audio and 12 fps video.

<br />
<br />Damn, 45 minutes ... I'm so jealous of the GBA's processing power. Damn Nintendo for being so cheap with the S-CPU! We probably couldn't handle <em>LZSS</em> decompression at 12 frames per second.
<br />
<br />12fps is pretty lousy, though. It must look like a slideshow at that rate.

<br />
<br />They may be drawn at 12 fps but they are frame duplicated to 24 fps and telecined to 30 fps before broadcast.

<br />Likewise, each frame of a Game Boy Video is shown five times on the GBA's 60 Hz display.

<br />
<br />Honestly? Yes ... yes they do :/
<br />Especially Adult Swim shows. But a lot of the new animation does. Not just the US stuff, either -- .hack//SLIDE, for instance.
<br />
<br />Neat to know it really is only 12fps, though. But yeah I see your point, you do have quite a bit more tolerance in animation than in say, live action fighting, for instance.

<br />What about using the S-FX1 (MarioChip) to perform the grunt work for us and move the decompressed data to the tile ram?
<br />
<br />Also; Its probably not THAT hard to build a PIO IDE Connector (Running in 16-bit no less) controller (something that sites between the cartridge and motherboard -- like a Game Genie; but with hardware registers that can control the CDROM)

<br /> I'm curious how you're going to drive the same address/data bus that the sCPU is attached to without physically burning it out? Is sCPU address/data driver buffered?

<br />The ARM core would decode to an internal work RAM, and then the memory controller could field requests from the DMA unit. Look at any of the other coprocessors, such as the Super FX, SA-1, and SPC7110.

<br />
<br />I can not give exact figures, but it should certainly be doable with 30fps, letterbox format or both.
<br />
<br />On an unrelated sidenote, I've finally made it to Kotaku and many of the major gaming newspages with N-Warp Daisakusen, which in turn sparked the interest of various german print magazines. A couple of articles are in the works, people are constantly asking for interviews, I'm loving it!
<br />
<br />It's obvious that the game has a very hard time on newspages like Kotaku, getting more or less directly compared to the recent big commercial games of today, but as the saying goes, "any publicity is good publicity". <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Like I said on <a href="http://gra.dforce3000.de" class="postlink">http://gra.dforce3000.de</a>, my primary concern is making people aware of the fact that SNES homebrew isn't dead yet.
<br />I'm looking forward to what the future holds.
