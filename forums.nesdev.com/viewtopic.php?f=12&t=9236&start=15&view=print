I should use the calipers from my job place.<br /><br />As for the pin numbering, I didn't get what you said. My board is<br /><br /><a href="http://www.snescentral.com/pcbboards.php?chip=SHVC-1CB5B-01" class="postlink">http://www.snescentral.com/pcbboards.php?chip=SHVC-1CB5B-01</a><br /><br />The pin numbering is the natural one: from 1 to 28 on the left (pin 1 in the dot corner as expected), 29 to 56 on the bottom, 57 to 84 on the left and 85 to 112 on the top side.<br />Anyway, I did my own checkings to get each pin usage, so even if numbering was wrong, the chip still would work properly.<br /><br />I'll keep you updated with progress.

I send to production as a first step to tune-up the whole process: I deal with PCB boards everyday at work and first prototypes never are as expected. So don't worry about it, I was really convinced that it wasn't going to work in fact.<br /><br />The best part is that PCB can be inserted by sanding the borders down a bit and pulling out the taps on the upper part of the cartridge, so I finally managed to put it into the enclosure.<br /><br />I must go now, but I'll send you some photos tomorrow.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think I see what I did.  I initially made the board the same dimensions as an original board, then I shaved it down to fit it within 10cm and in the process I completely got rid of the notches in the top corners on the expansion board, probably intending to take off the entire top 2mm of the board as well, but I didn't.  I think I'll go with adding the notches back rather than cutting down the height, the notches give an extra point of contact for holding the board solidly in place.  The rest of the issues probably just come down to manufacturing tolerances, so I should probably widen out all of the notches just a bit.<br /><br />Also, can you comment as to the accuracy of the placement of the circle in the middle of the board with relation to the plastic posts in the cart shell?  It's not supposed to be a drilled hole, just a &quot;keep out&quot; region, because the posts press right up against the PCB and any components placed there would make you unable to close the cart.  I should probably add that circle to the keepout layers as well, so that the DRC will enforce it (actually, I should add keepout layers to all of my libraries... I haven't been doing that).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, I updated my board outlines.  I had the wrong card edge pitch (I was using 2.54mm, it's actually 2.50mm), which I've fixed, and I added in manufacturing tolerances to the outline so there shouldn't be any more issues with the notches being too tight.  I also mitered the card edge and beefed up the pin number font (the font size/ratio I was using looked pretty puny and rubbed off a lot on the last batch of boards I ordered).

Will you please send it to my email? As for the central circle, I deleted it since it was not actually a hole, only a silkscreen circle and I thought it served not purpouse. Since my board was full of components, I decided to remove it to have more free room to place them.<br /><br />BTW, it sounds pretty interesting to me what you adviced me: to print the board in a sheet before production. How do you do it to ensure the printed board has the proper size? Do you export it with EAGLE? Do you use some special program to print it?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To print out the board, in Eagle go to File-&gt;Export-&gt;Image, select a decent DPI (I use 600), then print the resulting image with a photo program capable of printing at the original size, using DPI to specify the size.  I use Irfanview.  Also, if you place components inside where that circle was, you'll end up having to Dremel down the circular posts in the center of the cart shell, which are designed to stabilize the cart.
