Add to the fact that I'm in a small town in Canada where we don't have RadioShack or any place that readily sells capacitors anymore (which completely sucks) - I had to get the 2200uF from some backdoor alley place (quite literally) in a city 40 minutes away. If you'd care to elaborate on how I can try this test, I'd be willing to give it a shot.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So. Picture shows a varying frequncy, so is some kind of FM. Frequency seems to vary from 1280kHz to 1240kHz, by counting pixels and comparing to the known pixel clock. Assuming output has been (incorrectly) deinterlaced by the television, two subsequent frames show almost identical timing <em>and phase</em>, except in the middle of the frame where the boxer's gloves are. So whatever signal's been modulated, it's basically only got multiples of 60Hz in it. (Specifically ... looks like 120 Hz plus some higher even multiple for the asymmetry) If it were a beat pattern against mains or NTSC frequencies, it would shift by a half scanline or 70% of a scanline every vblankâ€”too small to see in this picture, I think.<br /><br />Question: just how stable are these waves? do they move while the NES is on? How fast?<br /><br />Assuming it is bad capacitors, and having already replaced the big on on the input stage to the 7805, you could try adding the one of those extra capacitors you have (the axial one should be easy, I'd hope) in parallel to one of the existing capacitors (Naively I'd put it right next to the PPU)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />They move down slowly while the NES is on, as if it were beating between 60.1 Hz (NES and Super NES vertical frequency) and 60 Hz (fluorescent bulbs or PSUs) or 59.94 Hz (vertical frequency of other video equipment). I'll have to count the beats more precisely to see which.<br /><br />EDIT: I just measured it, and it takes about 20 seconds for the wiggles to progress all the way down the screen and wrap around twice. This gives 10 seconds per loop, as if it were beating between 60 and 60.1 Hz.

As was mentioned earlier, the main 2200 cap has already been replaced with no effect. If you know another capacitor that could potentially be the culprit, suggest which one it is. There is very little information available on this problem online and most people who have encountered it on other boards that I've read either don't report the progress of any solutions or just forget about it. Since this seems to be a recurring problem with many systems, I would hope by the end of this, we'll have a working solution that other people can look to to get their systems operating correctly.
