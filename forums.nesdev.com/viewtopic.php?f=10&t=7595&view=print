<br />
<br />Hello, I am new this forum as well as to hex editing. Years ago I tried hex editing with some effort I changed some colors and made some deformed characters.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />  
<br />
<br />So far I have read a Beginner's guide recently that was good. It was  alot of help on the basics. <a href="http://www.nesplayer.com/database/info/emulation/doc/romdoc.html" class="postlink">http://www.nesplayer.com/database/info/emulation/doc/romdoc.html</a>
<br />
<br />Waiting for an Akira patch since the 90's and now Akira is the fire under my ass to learn how to edit text. I am having issues on understanding the part on making tables. Can anyone point me in a direction to understand more on building tables? I know I have to work on editing english text first and this is what I want to do.
<br />
<br />I appreciate any help I can get in my efforts in learning Hex editing hopefully I can be of some use in the future.

<br />
<br /><span style="color: yellow">Hexadecimal is a base 16 number system <strong>that works the same way</strong> our base 10 decimal number system works.</span>  
<br />
<br /><strong><span style="color: white"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">in base 10</span></span></strong>:
<br />each digit increases in power from right to left.  For instance:
<br />
<br />1234
<br />
<br />THe value of  the spaces increaces, from right to left like this
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10^3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10^2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10^1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10^0<br /></div><br /><br />Notice that <br /><span style="color: violet">10</span>^0 == 1<br /><span style="color: violet">10</span>^1 == 10<br /><span style="color: violet">10</span>^2 == 100<br /><span style="color: violet">10</span>^3 == 1000<br /><br />so our number system is base <span style="color: violet">10</span>.<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: white"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">in base 16</span></span></strong>:<br />each digit increases in power from right to left.

<br />
<br />are you asking how to draw the actual images and then save that data as something that can be used in a program? what i mean is, are you asking how to redraw the tiles and then replace the data to use the new tiles you have drawn?

<br />
<br />Well that is definetly something I want to get good at later on but right now i am dialed in with altering text in roms. I am trying to get proficient with doing this so hopefully once i move on altering english text in games I can try to tackle japanse text in games.
<br />
<br />The table file i am thinking of is something you can use with the program Thingy. I read that this file is so you can find the text in a rom quick without to much hassle.
<br />
<br />Correct me if I am wrong but I believe what i gathered from that beginners guide i need to open a pattern table i will write out on the txt file the code of each letter and number and load this up with the rom in thingy. And thingy will help me find all these letters and numbers quickly. So i can edit the text?
<br />
<br />Is this the most practical way to edit text and is there a good program i can use to do this because what is suggested in the beginners guide is to use nesticle but it doesnt work really with the famicom games.
<br />
<br />I think if i get some test runs in on english and it works good with out gliches i would like to move on to famicom carts. One in paticular. I just hope akira doesnt kick my ass too.

<br />Thats ok, I apreciate all your responses so far. Your hexadecimal lesson was alot of extra help. Good to see things in more than one place. Helps me get a diffrent perspective at times.

<br />
<br />For example, ASCII's 0-9 are 0x30-0x39, while a game might use d5-d15.
<br />But the distance from one character to the next will still hold. "025" would be 0x30, 0x32, 0x35 in ASCII, but the string in said hypothetical game would be d5, d7, d10.
<br />
<br />Does Thingy provide a search option? (It's been ages since I did any ROM hacking. It's also 2:30 AM, I have to go to sleep at the moment rather than search out info on Thingy)

<br />Thank you this does help, and i think once you get the table done in thingy it might have a search option? I hope so I will try it out tommarow. If not i wonder what will i use next. haha....
