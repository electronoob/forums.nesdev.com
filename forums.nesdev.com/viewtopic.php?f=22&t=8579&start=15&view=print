I think it hasn't been done because there isn't much motivation to do it.  Or at least not by people who have the tools and know how.  That and most homebrewers who may get excited about it's abilities have a long way to go to utilize all the capabilities of the MMC3 let alone the MMC5.<br /><br />If the NES has been put on modest programmable logic I'm pretty sure it's within reason to do the same for the MMC5.  There's just no one so far that's cared enough to do it that can.</div>
<br />
<br />The pins was more about using a cheaper CPLD. No one has tried cloning the MMC5 cause it wouldn't be cheap to make and what is the point exactly? To make bootleg games? The only other reason would be to clone it for the PowerPAK to run those games. 
<br />
<br />As tokumaru said it does some important watching of the CHR bus for certain effects and capabilities. It's not just a MMC3 on steroids. It would be neat if it was cloned but I would say you are right no one has cared enough to try, but also those that could pull it off are probably not interested as the pay off is not much.
<br />
<br />Also if you really need something better than MMC3 or FME7 I think you might as well make your own mapper with exactly the features you need.

<br />
<br />Yeah I'd agree with that, not much point in figuring out how the MMC5 does what it does.  You're better off spending that time creating your own to your needs.  At that point you're also able to minimize the mapper and logic to lowest cost devices.

<br />
<br />Any details on what is and isn't implemented? I don't think until now there has been any working MMC5 support. I tried Castlevania 3 and it started up ok and looked alright through the first level. But I forget if later on it uses features that might not be implemented or not.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Personally, I doubt there's little use for all of MMC5's features (nevermind more) for anything other than the existing library of commercial MMC5 games. I agree that there seems to be more value (intellectually and financially) in making a mapper does only what one needs. Especially when the alternative is to clone a mapper that hasn't even been fully reverse engineered.
<br />
<br />That said, the MMC5 does inspire one sometimes. Just the other day, I was thinking extended attributes would be cool. I had an idea that  nobody actually uses the tiny native sprites of the NES, and then I realized attribute clash basically dictates 16x16 or larger "objects", which calls for larger sprites. I think the end results could look a lot different (but subtly) than most NES games.
<br />
<br />But the game I had in mind for this, doesn't need all the rest of the MMC5's tricks. So, I might use it for dev, but for production, I don't think it'd be ideal.

<br /><ul><li>Read $2000-$23BF, $2400-$27BF, $2800-$2BBF, $2C00-$2FBF: Enable CIRAM and load address bits 0, 1, 5, and 6 (corresponding to the tile row and column within a nametable byte) into an internal latch </li><li>Read $23C0-$23FF, $27C0-$27FF, $2BC0-$2BFF, $2FC0-$2FFF: Disable CIRAM, enable an attribute RAM on the cart, and combine the PPU address bus with this internal latch to make the attribute RAM address </li><li>$3000-$37FF: Linear access to attribute RAM </li></ul>
<br />This would require about 10 inputs to watch PA0-PA9 (in addition to the PA10-PA13 you already get with most advanced mappers) and 12 outputs to control the attribute RAM's enable and address bus.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd actually designed something like this, uh... looks like a year ago but never had a reason to build it. The plan was actually for an all-RAM cart and 4-screen mirroring (because you can't buy &lt;8kB RAMs anymore)
<br />
<br />I didn't get as far as actually making the control signals, but here's the schematic I'd gotten most of the way through:
<br /><a href="http://eamp.org/li/nes-16bpt.png" class="postlink">Wide digital schematic</a>
<br />
<br />Since I was building it in 74-series chips, using a latch or a multiplexer were equal in cost, so I went for the one that was easier.
<br />
<br />IC2: Latches the lower 8 bits of the name table address for repetition on the attribute table fetch. Also passes the lower 8 bits of the address for pattern table fetches
<br />IC4A: Passes the top 4 bits of the name table address. Also passes the middle 4 bits of the address of pattern table fetches.
<br />IC4B: Passes the corresponding bits from the attribute fetch so that CHRRAMA contains the same 12 bit address for both the name table and attribute table fetches.
<br />IC5A&amp;B: On the attribute fetch, repeats the top two bits from the fetched byte so that we don't need to predict which bits the PPU is actually reading
<br />IC6: Transparent buffer for everything except attribute table fetches.
<br />IC3: Latches the lower 6 bits of the attribute tile fetch for use in pattern tables.
<br />IC7: Selects what 4kB bank is mapped into $1000 in the PPU.
<br />Not shown: Something to drive CHRRAMA12..A19 during nametable and attribute fetches. Could be 7 transistors and a buffer to map it into the top 8kB.
<br />
<br />Because I don't know (is it known?) how to distinguish between dummy name+attribute table fetches for the sprites, this design works around that by just having $0000 use the extended attributes and $1000 doesn't. Or vice versa, I didn't actually place the specific logic.

<br />The decasulation is an option but a painful for what would seem the low payout (usually the case with decapsulation IMO).  Is there a reason you're looking for this much accuracy?  It seems if you're developing a game your time would be severely better spent just redesigning the features of the MMC5 you'd like to use.  Your game doesn't need to have 100% MMC5 accuracy, just features that work as you use them.  You could even make something exceedingly better than the MMC5 with all the time it would take to decap it.  That and build a ton of carts of your game with all the money you would have spent on decapsulation.

<br />
<br />It chagrins me that MMC5 still isn't fully understood by the community. I believe that serves as a disincentive for MMC5 coding and development (let alone cloning), which in turn suppresses overall interest in MMC5-related activity. In short, it's a depressing feedback loop that I wish to see broken. If I have to spend a couple hundred bucks (or more) to get things moving in the right direction, it's something I'm more than happy to do.

<br />Yes, verifying how it syncs with the PPU, so that we can 1. make a clone that syncs the same way, and 2. predict what effect VRAM writes during vblank would have.
