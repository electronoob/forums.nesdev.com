		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A question to people who know Super Nintendo programming and ROM hacking:<br />How difficult would it be to do a hack with the following stuff:<br /><br />The game always presents the same opponents in the same order. (Which opponents in which order is defined by the one who creates the hack.)<br /><br />The player character can be changed after every battle. Again, the player characters are fixed for each battle.<br /><br />The question if player one or player two fights against the computer can also change in each battle, according to fixed rules.<br /><br />Optional: The ending sequences appear in a fixed order.<br /><br /><br />So, let's give an example: If the player starts the game, it will always go like this:<br /><br />Ryu vs. Ken<br />(Ken's stage. Player 1 controls Ryu. Computer controls Ken.)<br /><br />Guile vs. Chun Li<br />(Chun Li's stage. Player 2 controls Chun Li. Computer controls Guile.)<br /><br />Ryu vs. M. Bison<br />(M. Bison's stage. Player 1 controls Ryu. Computer controls M. Bison.)<br /><br />Ryu's ending sequence is played.<br /><br />Chun Li's ending sequence is played.<br /><br />Credits are played.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think someone who knows what they are doing could probably accomplish this in a handful of hours. Maybe round it up to one full day's work.<br /><br />If you need to learn from the ground up, I dunno. It could take you a week or a month or who knows. That depends where you are now and how you apply yourself. Anybody sufficiently motivated can learn what they need to and get this done, but it will be a lot of work.<br /><br />A more important question might be why do you want this, and does what you want justify this amount of work? Is this part of something cool enough that someone more skilled than you will be willing to do the work, or that you're willing to put in the time to learn?<br /><br />For example, if you want to make a video with a story told through SF2, requiring a specific fight order, this is easy to accomplish with video editing; probably ROM hacking is too much work for too little gain compared to the alternative.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No, it's not for a video. It's actually about playing the game.<br /><br />I was thinking about a story mode similar to the one for the new &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; game. Of course, &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; wouldn't include those cinematic cut scenes. But if determining the opponents' order had been easy, my next question would have been about including scenes like the ones in the end:<br /><br /><img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/outji8.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I think it would be interesting to be able to include those scenes before the battles. So you could have the fighters exchange some dialog before they start fighting.<br /><br />Combine all this and you can do an actual story mode with a realistic tournament schedule.
