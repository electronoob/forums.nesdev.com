If your point is simply to have the acessory remain usable for its original purpose, you could always cut the cord like suggested, but use a more standard connector to easily connect it back again. You would then use the same standard connector on the other acessory cable you cut. It'd still be a cut acessory, but at least mario paint wouldn't be useless.

An option that would not require hardware hacking, is to make an input system using combinations of controller buttons.<br /><br />I think I saw something similar on a friends' PSP<br /><br />Each character could be represented by a combination of one or two adjacent directions in the d-pad, [ and | or ] one or both the A &amp; B buttons, or one or both the select &amp; start buttons.<br /><br />The d-pad would yield 8 different combinations, and each 2 button cluster would yield 3 ( one, the other ot both )<br />so it would be 8 x 3 = 24 x 2 = 48, <br />plus 8 d-pad combinations alone, and 3 combinations of button clusters alone, giving a total of: 48 + 8 + 3 + 3 = 62<br /><br />That's a lot of characters or commands.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3773">Petruza</a> — Sun Mar 29, 2009 8:43 am</p><hr />

I've typed on my NES, using just normal old HyperTerminal.  I've built simple RS232 adapters for the controller port before, but it's kinda useless for random input since you'd have to poll it incessantly.<br /><br />I wire the same adapter up to the the PIC on Squeedo though, and it's excellent there, having a huge (256 byte) circular buffer in PIC code, and a specific IRQ for the NES.  An accessory like this though is cooler through the controller port (slower though).<br /><br />I've had quite a few cool ideas to do with the NES controller port, one thing that stopped me from developing more stuff like that is the limited supply of NES controller cables.  I have a box of them, and SNES ones, that bunnyboy gave me quite a while back (thanks again, and since you're here - are there any more?).<br /><br />There lots of stuff I'd like to build, if there were enough parts.<br />Things that'd be interesting - SD card, EEPROM, USB link (a MODEM!), keyboard, mouse/paddle/trackball, MIDI..<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />if you're willing to cut the cord it looks like you could just swap the connector<br /></div><br /><br />It would seem so, according to the mouse info in here too:<br /><a href="http://www.repairfaq.org/REPAIR/F_SNES.html" class="postlink">http://www.repairfaq.org/REPAIR/F_SNES.html</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Mar 29, 2009 12:25 am</p><hr />

I have thought about text entry for text adventure type games, and best I have come up with is a bar that can switch between keywords/items/keyboard and also an on screen cursor that can select any on screen word.  That way you could do things like show room items and click on one of those words.  Should work well for programming where you would have labels/variables to select.  <br /><br />The other option is to make a PS/2-&gt;NES adapter with a PIC chip.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=228">bunnyboy</a> — Sat Mar 28, 2009 1:44 pm</p><hr />

I would like to see a straight up 6502 editor on the NES, just for testing purposes. The way I envisioned it was that all code was in RAW 6502 format. So there wouldn't be any JMP Label, instead it would be JMP $xxxx. This would allow for as much code as possible without taking up extra RAM space with label names and such. This would be possible with any game that has SRAM, so you could make 8k demos, and of course have CHR RAM so that you could make your own graphics.<br /><br />All code would be stored as is, so there wouldn't be much "assembling". There would have to be more than a few bytes that tell you what's code and what's data though. You would select words from a menu, like you stated, where they'd be laid out in a grid, and you'd select "LDA", and then it would take you to another menu that would allow you to choose "Immediate" or "Indirect Y", etc.<br /><br />But if you choose to make a BASIC interpreter, I would suggest going with the choose from a menu method. That seems to be the only choice you have. Though I'd lay them out intelligently, so it's not just alphabetical order, but the most common keywords first or something similar.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat Mar 28, 2009 12:22 pm</p><hr />
