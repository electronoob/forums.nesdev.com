I'm looking to change the text where it says &quot;GET UP!!!&quot; when you get knocked down. Would be great if someone had the address/code for this, also willing to learn!<br /><br />In the process of competing a custom copy of a punch-out hack for a friend. I have soaked up much of what romhacking.net has to offer, but am lost in this one last little detail.<br />I can't determine how to work with compressed data nor can I find my way to start into 6502 coding, which brings me to my next question.<br /><br />2. can anyone send me in the right direction to start learning 6502 assembly? something comprehensive, from the start. even if that means going to learn C+ first.<br /><br />hope this isnt &quot;too noob&quot; for everyone here<br />Rock n Roll

I have made a table for punchout, which i believe corresponds with what you have given me. Looked through the rom for the hex string that corresponds and cant come up with anything, even changed every instance that &quot;get&quot; came up where it matched the table, never seen a change in the game. I have, however; never separated the rom into its chr and prg to look for the data though (i presume the table still works) never thought that would make a difference.<br /><br />is there a tool for putting the roms back together, or is it just done in hex?

I managed to change the text on the scoreboard by finding it in SearchR3, then use my table to find the text in a hex editor, and changed it. SearchR3 cannot find either &quot;LOL! XD&quot; in &quot;phred's cool punch out 2 turbo&quot; nor can it find &quot;GET UP&quot; in an original.<br />i search &quot;GET&quot; and it gets 8 results, only 2 of which correspond with the table.<br />use hex editor to find any instance of &quot;110F1EFF1F1A&quot;, it finds none.<br />i change all instances of &quot;110F1E&quot;, with no change to the rom.<br /><br />after an hour or so of searching and probably close to that of head scratching, i started looking into what romhacking had, and it was to go to assembly lol.<br />showed up here after i remembered to do so lol.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The reason you're having difficulty finding this &quot;string&quot; is because:<br /><br />1) It's not a linear sequence of bytes -- there are &quot;metabytes&quot; in between the values,<br />2) Use of <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC2" class="postlink">MMC2</a> for &quot;magic stuff&quot; happening through use of tile <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">$FD</tt>.  (This is why when viewing the raw CHR data in the PPU in an emulator you usually won't find the 0-9A-Z font being shown while playing the immediate game, although they are shown during the &quot;VS.&quot; screen -- so that's how you can get the tile offsets).<br /><br />The actual string for &quot;GET UP!&quot; represented in tile values is as you determined (though you left off the last byte): <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">$11 0F 1E FF 1F 1A 27</tt>, and is written to PPU RAM at offset $2362/$2B62/$3362/$3B62.<br /><br />So how do you reverse-engineer this?  The easiest way is just to look at the differences between the (non-patched original) ROM and the patched ROM and look for specific sequences of changes that reference those 7 bytes somehow.<br /><br />The other way -- and it's how I'm going to do it, because I don't have the patch you're referring to (nor do I know what exact original ROM it applies to; the filename is not sufficient!) -- is to use FCEUX and set up a breakpoint for writes to one of the above PPU RAM addresses (because we don't know which one the game actually writes to).  So I added 4 breakpoints, one for each PPU RAM address, with these settings:<br /><br />Address {see above}<br />Checked &quot;Write&quot;<br />Selected &quot;PPU Mem&quot;<br /><br />...and then let someone pummel me and was able to find the code in question.  I should note that the PPU RAM address written to is $2362 (trust me).  The routine which wrote to PPU RAM was this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;05:8020:A2 00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDX #$00<br />&nbsp;05:8022:86 60&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;STX $0060 = #$00<br />&nbsp;05:8024:A5 64&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA $0064 = #$23<br />&nbsp;05:8026:8D 06 20&nbsp; STA $2006 = #$62<br />&nbsp;05:8029:A5 63&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA $0063 = #$62<br />&nbsp;05:802B:8D 06 20&nbsp; STA $2006 = #$62<br />&nbsp;05:802E:A0 00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDY #$00<br />&nbsp;05:8030:B1 66&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA ($66),Y @ $8DA5 = #$00<br />&nbsp;05:8032:F0 3F&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BEQ $8073<br />&nbsp;05:8034:C8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; INY<br />&gt;05:8035:8D 07 20&nbsp; STA $2007 = #$00<br /></div><br />A was $11 when this code was about to be run, and thankfully FCEUX is cool enough to show the effective address that <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">lda &#40;$66&#41;,y</tt> loaded from -- $8DA5.  This is within ROM bank #5 as well, and (to make matters easier) that would have had to be the active code bank at the time, since MMC2 only supports a 8KByte switchable bank for $8000-9FFF.<br /><br />So from that point I loaded up the Hex Editor in FCEUX and went to $8DA0 and started to look around.  Guess what I found?  Look very very closely at the values -- don't look at them linearly, look &quot;between the lines&quot; so-to-speak:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">8DA0: FD 01 FD 00 11 00 0F 00 1E 00 00 1F 00 1A 00 27<br />8DB0: 00 FD 01 FF FF AC AD 00 FF FF 00 FE 06 AE 00 FF<br /></div><br />Any of those values look familiar?  :-)  They should correlate with linear bytes in the actual ROM file (the original ROM that is).  You might notice that there's no $FF (for blank/space) there -- instead they use $00, which in the underlying assembly code (if you looked closely) would result in that tile/byte being skipped over (meaning: PPU RAM already contained value $FF at the time).<br /><br />I loaded up an actual file hex editor, found the correlating bytes above at file offset $16DB0 (the Punch Out!! ROM I have is named &quot;Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! (U) (PRG1).nes&quot;, MD5 c119a5a9b0e2959ad5d11562f9f4ce55).  Now, whether or not they're at the same file offset in the patched ROM is a separate story -- depending on how much work the guy who did the patch put into it, he might have revamped a lot of things, so I can't guarantee they're at that location.<br /><br />But now you know 1) how to determine what tile value (in PPU RAM) represents what letter (re: shown during the &quot;VS.&quot; screen), and 2) generally what sequence of bytes to search for that represent the idiotic &quot;LOL! XD&quot; text.  So in summary, I'd try searching for <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">$16 $00 $19 $00 $16 $00 $27</tt> (that should be &quot;LOL!&quot;) and see if you find anything.<br /><br />Hope this helps you.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hm. I found the original pattern in the original image (offset in the .nes of 0x150a1) but it turns out that's not what's used to draw the text.<br /><br />It's encoded with a simple RLE and is later (offset 0x16da4). So, to explain how I found that:<br /><br />* Use FCEUX (or something with an equally powerful debugger); run with the debugger already open<br />* Play until shortly before the message appears<br />* Save state<br />* Continue until the message appears<br />* Pause by clicking the &quot;step into&quot; button in the debugger<br />* Set up a breakpoint for the message appearing.<br />-- Open the Name Table viewer<br />-- Hover over the G, which will tell you that it's at PPU address $2362 and consists of byte $11.<br />-- In the debugger, set up a breakpoint for Writes to PPU address $2362, and set the condition to <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">A == #11 || X == #11 || Y == #11</tt> (Unfortunately we don't know before hand which register will be used to write, so there will be some false positives)<br />* Load the saved state<br />* Resume execution by clicking the &quot;run&quot; button in the debugger<br />* Get some false positives because the register that's writing to $2007 (in the disassembly) isn't the one that the breakpoint triggered on. Click &quot;run&quot; after each to resume.<br />* It finally correctly breaks at 05:8035 in the debugger. Just above (and below) it shows a few instructions of the form <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">LDA &#40;$66&#41;,Y @ $8DA5 = #$00</tt>.<br />* Verify by opening the hex editor, go to $8DA4, find the string <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">11 00 0F 00 1E 00 00 1F 00 1A 00 27 00</tt>.<br />* Convert the address to a ROM offset: ($05 * 2 = $0A) * $2000 + $8DA4 - $8000 = $14DA4. For stupid reasons, fceux only presents the offset in quanta of 16KiB, so you might need to look at $16DA4 also. It turns out that it IS the latter one.<br />* Convert that to an offset in the .nes file: + $10 = $16DB4<br />* Modify as desired<br /><br /><br />.... dammit, ninja'd.<br /><br />edit: finished doing the math. actually was the same address. I was working from the post-Tyson image: md5sum=3e4af91097aece830b3039af3f2c0802  Punch-Out!! (U) [!].nes
