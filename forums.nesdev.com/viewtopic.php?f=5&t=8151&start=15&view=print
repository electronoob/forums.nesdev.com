<br />I was thinking more along the side of business things and overall evolution, but yes, the same point applies to general software and stuff.  I have my own theories about it all (main one being it takes about 20-25 years for things to come full circle and repeat; nostalgia aspects, etc.).  But yeah, Minecraft and Angry Birds.  Might as well replace them with original 3D Wolfenstein (or Doom) and original Castles for the Apple II (I'm certain the latter kind of game exists on every console and home computer made, heh.  :-) )
<br />
<br />The business side of things though -- make sure you read *why* Nintendo (and Ricoh -- sounds like a combo of the two to me) went with the 6502 on the Famicom/NES.  Business opportunity yes, but there's a confirmed deeper meaning: because nobody in Japan knew shit about the 6502.  The same bullshit happens today, though in a roundabout way -- obfuscate what might get stolen, fear everyone (maybe justifiably?), etc. all in the good name of money.
<br />
<br />Anyway sorry for turning a thread into somewhat of a sad realisation.  I've had a rough night on a purely solo and personal level.  I just got finished watching an entertainment-documentary film about computing from the mid-70s to the late 90s and it just reminds me how obsolete folks like myself am.  Folks who adapt and change make it sound so easy, but there are those of us who do things best and feel comfortable in that role knowing what they know.  I feel like it's all a dying breed.  The article about Nintendo just reminded me of it all on a grand scale, that's all; not anyone's fault here.

<br />
<br />Yeah. I gave a couple examples of things that are proving the paradigm may not be as gilt as the "big boys" may thing. Will they ever learn from their mistakes? It seems humanity never, <strong>ever</strong> learns from its mistakes. Why should gaming be any different?
<br />
<br />Being a bit of an old fogey of sorts myself, I can relate to what you're saying. I remember watching the text-adventure documentary "Get Lamp" after a friend had it drop-shipped to me. It was a real roller-coaster of emotions for me. Seeing the roots of the genre, and its ultimate fading into the sunset as a mainstream gaming archetype... it was beyond poignant.
<br />
<br />It seems that the ones in control of things will always assert their control in the most bizarre ways, while the ones who want to create and innovate get left in the dust. Everyone else asks for more of the same. Guess who never fails to give it to them time and time again.

<br />
<br />Koitsu describes so well how I feel about technology in general.  I'm much more comfortable *not* adopting the latest trend, instead "doing it the way I did it before" because I know it works.  I'm much more drawn to 2D games.  I *loved* the text adventure genre and even went so far as creating a couple myself with friends...mostly on paper that I still have...and still plan *someday* to commit to electrons.
<br />
<br />I'm actually repulsed by the constant craving of today's technophiles for "the latest gadget".  It sickens me to think how many people will be throwing away perfectly good working iPhone 4's in order to be "the cool guy" with the new iPhone 5.  Not to mention the environmental impact of all this churn.
<br />
<br />In similar vein, I'm repulsed by the drive for "bigger" everything.  I helped to design the navigation system of the Airbus A380, all the while thinking to myself "this thing is just plain ridiculous!"  A job is a job, though...
<br />
<br />I'm pretty proud to be an old fogey already stuck in his ways.  Sometimes it's useful...for example...convincing people that the newest whiz-bang processor isn't necessarily the best choice for a product.
<br />
<br />Anyway, rotInMilc, I'll definitely be looking into the "Get Lamp" documentary.  Thanks!

<br />Unless the rechargeable battery is near its end of life, or a user wants to run one of the apps that will take full advantage of an iPhone 5 but scale poorly to previous hardware. This has already happened with the iPhone 4: games targeted for it run poorly on an iPhone 3GS or even an iPod touch 4. How many people sold their Game Boy Color when the Game Boy Advance came out?

<br />
<br />Really, how many iPhones do we really need before we get something more than a minor revision tacked-on and marketed as the "LATEST AND GREATEST BUY TODAY BECAUSE THE MODEL WE RELEASED YESTERDAY IS OBSOLEEEEEEEETE!!!"?
<br />
<br />Game Boy Color -&gt; Game Boy Advance -&gt; Nintendo DS is one thing.* iPhone, iPhone without Flash support, and iPhone that is jailbreak-proof is something entirely different.
<br />
<br />* Not that I endorse Nintendo's business practices, but at least you can consider their upgrades more noteworthy on average.

<br />That, and that again. Note that many of my friends on capus fall right into this category, in the end it's just a waste of money for them. I have the same simple cellphone since 5 years I'm perfectly satisfied with it and I'm not going to replace it as long as it works.

<br />
<br />Occasionally:
<br />Step 7: <em>Take away or nerfing</em> some of the features of the original <em>not because of cost-cutting measures</em> but to convince that it is cooler this way (like reducing the size of screens in handheld devices*, removing backward compatibility and removing physical media support to name a few, GBM and PSP Go anyone?).
