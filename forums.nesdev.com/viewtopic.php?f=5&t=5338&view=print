		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm under the impression that pretty much all famiclones use the NES-on-a-chip technology, and I'm also under the impression that it works pretty well except for sound, where the duty cycles are swapped. I'm guessing this gives various sounds a different timbre than the original NES.
<br />
<br />Does anyone know who developed this chip, and whether there are any plans to improve it to be more accurate?
<br />
<br />Also, I've heard that the Retro Duo isn't an NES on a chip, but that it is an emulator---does that mean it has some kind of higher performance 32 bit CPU running an open source NES emulator or is it totally custom hardware? I feel like I've heard that the sound is much closer to the original NES than other famiclones.

<br />I wouldn't be surprised if nobody knows by this point. The mask might have just been passed around like an STD. If there were a free (as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCores" class="postlink">OpenCores</a>) NES clone written in VHDL or Verilog or something, and if it had better compatibility with MMC5 games than the common NOAC, then the Chinese manufacturers might switch to it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Famiclones have been around for a while.  I didn't know that before someone (wish I could remember who now) sent me a non-working "Game Turtle", it says on the box "1992 Computer Game".  What was cool too is that it's all discrete chips, there are individual CPU and PPU clone chips.  Oddly enough, it's PAL mode so I imagine it wouldn't work with a lot of Famicom carts (being NTSC timed by definition).  I showed it to kevtris, who fixed it.

<br />The "Turbo Game" I have is like this too. I believe the "Phantom System" is like this as well, but I never opened one. Those 2 were the most common consoles around here before the NES was officially released. I wonder how those non-NOAC clones were created.

<br />Pics aren't showing up for me, but I'm guessing it does have individual chips, yes?
