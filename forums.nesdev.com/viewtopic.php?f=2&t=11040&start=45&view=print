You can reserve a section of the tilemap for the top of the screen (it won't scroll), and IIRC you can do the same for a vertical column to the side of the screen (don't remember if it's left or right) - just not both at the same time.

Coded to the metal as efficiently as possible, it would be possible to create an SNES game that ran well, and possibly even hold it's own against the Genesis, even more-so if you decide to use cartridge add-ons.<br /><br />Another is that slowdown, if it's ever encountered, should be left alone and hope that it's only brief enough that you wouldn't notice.  Unfortunately, deadlines, poor management, and poor planning will take their toll on how a game runs.  Sometimes games were just made to run and that's all, sometimes games were essentially aborted and simply finalized.  Often times, the game designers just winged it.</div><br /><br />...and even with deadlines, they could've avoided most of the slowdowns in the first place if they just programmed the SNES like a game system, instead of programming it like a PC.  I wouldn't be surprised if anyone used floating-point arithmetic on the SNES. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />

It has a routine that reads from a list of sprites, and generates the OAM buffer.  What doesn't make sense is how they placed the size bit where the second priority bit is supposed to be, and it has to do extra shifting to get it out.

I'm guessing that almost every routine in the game would need to be individually fixed to get the slowdown removed.<br /><br />I posted a text file of asm patches I made that are supposed to reduce slowdown.  I even tried to convert it to a fastROM.

This way they could still use their subroutines that generated sprite tables in old SFC format and translate them to the final format afterward.
