It means the pixel format of video data buffer passed to ffencoder_video(encoder, vdata, linesize) is AV_PIX_FMT_BGRA. In bytes order, RGB datas are stored like this:<br />high            low<br />A    R    G    B<br /><br />ffencoder will converts input video data to YUV420 format which will be accepted by x264 video encoder. The color converting is done internally by libswscale module of ffmpeg. the output format of color converting is always YUV420, the input format should specified by pixel_fmt. You should specifiy the correct value of pixel_fmt, otherwise the encoding result file will be problem.

All effects/graphics conversion/upscaling is done using a sleeping-dispatch thread. Technically if my emulator finished emulating one frame it dispatches the PPU frame to another thread/threads which takes care of upscaling (2xsai,xbrz, ntsc, 2x, 3x, tv modes, 1:1 -&gt; 8:7 resizing, etc). when it finished the frame it will pause itself and send the data to the GUI thread..<br /><br />The GUI thread draws the frame in the window and also encodes it to a videofile (using VfW). probably will add your ffencoder.dll to as it also compresses audio!. The reason why I have done this is as follows:<br /><br />first:<br />The emulation thread doesn't need to be paused/halted, when the rendering/upscaling/conversion thread is compositing the image. (unless the 2nd frame is ready before the 1st frame has been processed then the emulation thread needs to be paused). After compositing the image the GUI thread takes over and draws it to the screen and if you are recording.. encodes it to a video stream.<br /><br />And then. while we are encoding to a videostream.. the emulation thread fires another composition request.. meaning we have 3 threads taking care of:<br /><br />* emulation<br />* display composition<br />* and encoding to a video stream.<br /><br />at any given moment nothing is idle. because when the video encode is complete, the next frame is ready or almost ready from the compositor and the emulation thread is already computing the next frame. Ofcourse using 4xBRZ (1024x672) will bog down the emulator eventually on a old core2quad cpu. At that moment we are just asking too much.

This is exactly 3/2 times the NTSC color burst frequency, which is defined as 315/88 MHz.</li><li>Number of dots is 341*262 in &quot;long&quot; frames and 341*261+340 in &quot;short&quot; frames, or an average of 89341.5 frames</li><li>Dot clock rate divided by number of dots is 945000000/(176*89341.5) = 945000000/15724104.

As excepted the audio starts to lag. Because your audio runs @ ~60.10Hz and video op 60Hz. This will eventually desync your video.
