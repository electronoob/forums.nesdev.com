And then i've got blackscreen. I can not access to the title screen...<br /><br />So i tried with a Megaman X3 Rom in a c160, putted in my socket, and it worked !<br /><br />But why isn't it working with Megaman X2?<br /><br />Can someome help me ? have you ever tried this mod ? Is this a pinout problem with this X2? a Rom problem (Tried with U and E Rom, same thing...).<br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br /><br />Br,<br /><br />Bool.

I think X2 might use two MaskROMs. To use just one, you'd probably need to alter the ROM image to set the register for a single ROM chip.

Somewhere in the game it writes #$01 to $7f52. That needs to be commented out or set to #$00. (I may have the bit flipped in my head again.) The register toggles whether banks 20-3f go to the second ROM chip or not. Which obviously there will only be one.</div>

MMX3 on an RMX2 board?  Then you might have a point.

Just bite the bullet and buy the real deal... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Oh well, if you really want to run RMX2 on an RMX3 board without patching the ROM, you can probably just AND the CX4's two /CE outputs into the ROM's /CE and it should work with a single ROM.
