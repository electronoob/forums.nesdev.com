		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's very possible that the pattern table animation tokumaru made was only from a couple spots in the game, and that <strong>more</strong> (read: different) data is shoved into the pattern table when needed (may differ between chat scenes, e.g. when Dr. Light is there vs. when he isn't).  This would explain the missing &quot;r.&quot;.  I believe it's just a capital D followed by a unique/special tile that shows &quot;r.&quot;.<br /><br />It's also possible that the game uses CHR-RAM (I didn't look) and that there is a special one-off for certain graphics/tiles, and the &quot;r.&quot; one is one such tile (drawn entirely by code, rather than an obvious tile somewhere in the ROM).  This is extremely common if tile graphics are compressed.<br /><br />Likewise, it's just as possible the game uses CHR-RAM and manipulates the pattern table per-scanline or &quot;per tile line&quot; (see my prevoious post).<br /><br />I really don't want to write up a long explanation of how to debug this in FCEUX.  I started to, and it just got longer and longer with a bazillion edge cases.

Note the pattern table contents.<br /><br />The last 2 screenshots are from the MMC5 version you uploaded to mediafire, same spot in the intro.  Note the pattern table contents / differences.<br /><br />As for your &quot;r.&quot;, it's there in the Japanese version -- pattern table #0, top row, 5th tile from the left -- here's a screenshot from the intro (with FCEUX paused) along with the pattern table contents at that time -- but when it gets swapped in/out of the pattern table is entirely dependent upon the code of the game.  For example, each &quot;scene&quot; during the intro changes pattern table contents.  Not to mention, the code defines how much gets swapped/in out, and where (within PPU RAM / pattern tables).  It probably varies all over the place.<br /><br />While in the US version, the text in the intro actually says &quot;DR.LIGHT&quot; -- a separate tile for D, R, period, L, etc...  There is no &quot;r.&quot; tile.  I have no idea if such is present in the original Japanese release (I only have the MMC5 ROM you provided).<br /><br />Rockman 4 was released in December 1991, which makes it one of the more advanced/complex games to deal with.  Every game is different, but ones which use CHR-RAM (like this) tend to be more painful because a lot of the time the graphics are compressed (to keep ROM size down / saved a lot of money), and because you have to figure out where in the game (and there are usually multiple spots/parts) where the graphics are moved in/out of the pattern table and if there are &quot;one-offs&quot;.<br /><br />Starting to get an idea of how painful this is, and how just asking someone to &quot;quickly look it over&quot; isn't really accurate/effective in cases like this?  No offence intended of course, just pointing out that you basically need a dedicated programmer who can work on this for you, and he/she will need to spend a <strong>lot</strong> of time with the code.

At first glance, I didn't find any of the extra characters, but since they are obviously used in the game I'm assuming they are compressed, meaning that the program itself needs to be examined. The program needs to be debugged at the specific parts where these texts appear, so that the routines that load the patterns to CHR-RAM can be examined. Unfortunately, I don't have the time for this, but if you provided save states right before these text screens, that would surely help whoever decides to analyze this.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">it's missing the lowercase r (as in, Dr. WILY, etc) as well as the brackets ( and )</div><br />These are the ones I couldn't find uncompressed.

This hack is pretty nuts.</div><br />The only other font I remember seeing has a drop shadow or bevel under it, I don't know where it's used.<br /><br />Anyway, finding out what characters are already there is the least important thing here, because you can easily add more characters to unused parts of the ROM (there seems to be a lot o blank space in there). The actual work is looking at the pattern tables when each text screen is displayed (again, save states would help), and if there are characters you need that are not available at those specific moments, you need to find characters you can overwrite (such as the Japanese characters, which are useless when English is selected), and hack the routine that loads characters to do just that. After that, all that's left is figuring out the format in which the actual text is stored, so you can write your own text over it. When I say &quot;you&quot; I mean the person who's doing all the hacking, not necessarily you SatoshiMatrix.

There are also multiple Japanese character sets used (one looks partial, the other looks full) as well as English characters (capitals only of course) a little further down.

Since there is no single-character/letter on a keyboard that represents it, chances are the text/string parsing code has a special value when using it (possibly they used a special value like $FF to represent it, or possibly the texts are 2-bytes-per-character and it has its own unique code).<br /><br />For example in the MMC5 Japanese intro (see screenshot), the tile offset/value is $04, but in other areas of the game it might be something different.<br /><br />Whether or not these tile offsets/values match 1:1 with the actual text in the ROM is unknown to me -- sometimes they don't, sometimes they do, it all depends on the game.  Sometimes they even mix-and-match depending on the part of the game/scene (which is very common in games of this complexity (so many scenes, multiple &quot;batches&quot; of character sets, etc.).  For example, the English characters of the ASCII table start at offset $20, rather than $00; normally a string like &quot;DOGS&quot; would be represented as bytes $444f4753, but if the programmer of the game chose to stick the base offset for the English set at $60, &quot;DOGS&quot; would be represented by bytes $a4afa7b3.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">SatoshiMatrix wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">given what you guys said, I guess the idea of adding in the lowercase a-z characters from the Megaman 9 font is out of the question as it would be far too difficult for the average rom hacker?</div><br />Given that someone already romhacked this thing to move it from MMC3 to MMC5 -- note, I'm ASSUMING the original Japanese release is MMC3, I don't have the ROM so I can't verify -- I would recommend you get in contact with that someone.  That's honestly the easiest thing to do.<br /><br />Is it doable?  Yes, but there's a lot of work that has to go into the code part of things; specifically new CHR data needs to be shoved into the pattern table and then used, and whether or not there's actually room in the pattern table is unknown to me (it probably varies per scene).  Like with any decent romhack, it all boils down to the code, and very rarely (particularly on complex games) can just be a &quot;graphics hack&quot;.  TL;DR -- it's not just a simple graphics edit.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">SatoshiMatrix wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">would savestates help you guys with stuff?

But then again who said any of us are taking on this project?  I can't speak for tokumaru, but I know I'm not.  I'm just helping with the &quot;technical education&quot; bits.  The only &quot;romhack&quot; things I do these days are things that I personally find fun/enjoyable, and I tend to act solo since I &quot;don't work well with others&quot;.  :-)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I got in touch with the Japanese hacker though email today, and hopefully he'll be able to tell some new info that will help with this. Apparently, all weapon and item screens have been already translated by one of his friends with a better understanding of English, but even so many of them are poorly worded and still somewhat Engrishy. <br /><br />I've asked him about the possibility of adding the lowercase english alphabet to the hack. I'll see what he says about that and let you guys now. For now, I continue my CAPSLOCK IS CRUSE CONTROL FOR COOL translation. <br /><br />I used this as a proof of concept. <br /><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/34ea60e99c9d0be2244eece5172ba8db/tumblr_mohk61asBO1rc7qlzo2_400.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/cd526669cdcd9224f7ef1be94d3fe0b4/tumblr_mohk61asBO1rc7qlzo1_400.png" alt="Image" />
