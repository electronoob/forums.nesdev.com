<br />
<br />The board already is different than nintendo's ones since the side with the chips is on the front of the cart: nintendo ones are on the back.
<br />
<br />Anybody have any information about this?

Do we know the pinouts of these mappers? Anyway, I hope someone can give a straight answer, but if that doesn't happen and you got the board, you could test it yourself.

<br />
<br />The pin-out of the mappers do exist, so is the pin of the famicom cart too.  If someone know the answer, that would simplify things of course. The bbs have been quite calm recently so maybe nobody really saw that message yet.
<br />
<br />If I do have to check it myself then I need to confirm something though.  For Konami VRC games (and namcot 163 ones) The chips are on the <em>opposite side</em> of the board.  So I guess I have to make sure that I don't mix the famicom cart pin-out since both side have different meaning (right?).

<br />Should we put this content on the wiki? I guess it can be inserted in the pinout section.

<br />
<br />Ok then.  I will try to double proof the information first (worst case I can correct it on the wiki).  I think the best way would be to remove the chip, put a socket and test back the game inside but it may take time. For the time being I will just re-check the different pins I found to make sure I didn't goof up.
<br />
<br />I should be able to test Madara (VRC-VI) soon and maybe a VRC-IV (some goemon RPG) once I put my hand back on an extra copy.
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />Is it me or the pin out seems to be exactly like a 27C040?  If this is the case then wouldn't it had make this board great in the past since you can use the same board for your dev and final product too.  I just realized that while thinking about an older post with Xander.

<br />
<br />So both games uses similar pinout as a 27C040/020 for all chips. My guess is that VRC-IV must be the same.  Will try to test it someday. Quite interesting for dev use those board if you use eprom.
<br />
<br />The content was updated on the wiki and I fixed a few things regarding those mappers.

<br />
<br />It follows "almost" the standard pinout.  What I didn't realize is that pin 22 (CE) and pin 24 (OE on eprom) are inverted. So very close but not 100% compatible.  For making a dev cart this is not a big issue.  And I don't think any people would make repro from those ones anyway (what's the point since there is technically only 1 VRC-VII game and 3 VRC-VI ones).
<br />
<br />I will need to try to check someday other boards to see how standard or not they are.  One I could check is a Namcot T163 board for Dragon Ninja.  For FME-7, I don't have one yet.

<br />
<br />I see. Then I have a question since I'm quite noobish about electronics.  Instead of /CE on pin 22, there is a GND.  What is the value of GND? High or low?  
<br />
<br />So if GND means high then following your logic, /CE would be high and it would ignore the /OE, making the 27CXXX compatible with this board without any modification.
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />I think I figured out my answer.  I will rephrase it since what I said made no sense at all.
<br />
<br />Since /CE is active low, connecting it to GND (which I think is low) will activate it. Following your logic,   It /CE is activated, /OE will be ignored.  In that case, 27CXXX chips would be compatible with that board.  Is what I'm saying make sense?  Just GND that I'm not sure about the value.

<br />
<br />Thanks for the answer. So this mean that those 2 boards are compatible with 27CXXX eproms.  Now I need to check Namcot 163 when I can find time.
