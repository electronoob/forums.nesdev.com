<br />Yes in fact it seems we've been wasting odd bank numbers all along!  It's terrible that we're now wasting them by making use of them.

In fact, author of the <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/569/" class="postlink">Binary City</a> optimized some code to get extra room for new features, and stopped to add stuff into the game when he ran out of room completely. With extended NROM such project would have a chance to be made faster and be even larger.

I thought that was part of the point of them, to prevent these cases where multiple mappers are lumped together as a single "mapper number", then you have to do hacky things to detect which type it is.
<br />
<br />Not that it wouldn't work, or be any less usable, just seems like an unnecessary hack to use the ROM size instead of the mapper descriptor to describe the mapper.

<br />(oh and I haven't really given up for some reason...)
<br />
<br />PS : And of course I'm not AGAINST the concept of extended NROM. It's just I think people make things a little bit silly, including myself, probably because people are way too much exited about mappers and crazy hardware quirks than about actual games.

<br />
<br />That's true, but I would think that emulators would always treat a ROM as being mirrored (up to the max size supported by the board, which may be larger than the ROM used).  Because it will do that anyways, I would think emulators wouldn't need to know the difference betwen NROM-128 and NROM-256.
