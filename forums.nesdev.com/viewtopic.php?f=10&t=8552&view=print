		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm messing around with Nintendulator for the first time (via VMware), along with Donkey Kong and its disassembly (from romhacking.net). 
<br />
<br />A fairly simple behavior is puzzling me: when you pause DK, it waits a few frames and then disables the sprites onscreen. I say 'disabled' with some certainty - according to Nintendulator, the sprites' y-coordinates have not been changed to #FF, so they're still in place, just 'invisible.' My assumption was that sprites were disabled via $2001, but I can't figure out exactly <em>where</em> in the source this happens.
<br />
<br />I've found three $2001 references:
<br />
<br />1. In the NMI handler, after a controller read. This would be my top candidate:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;Read gamepads<br />C886 : 20 1D F5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;jsr&nbsp; &nbsp;$F51D&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />;Toggle BKG and sprite visibility<br />C889 : A5 11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;lda&nbsp; &nbsp;$11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;<br />C88B : 49 18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;eor&nbsp; &nbsp;#$18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;<br />C88D : 8D 01 20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;sta&nbsp; &nbsp;$2001&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;<br /></div><br /><br />2. In a routine that disables the BG:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;Load local copy of PPU control 2 register<br />D196 : A5 11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;lda&nbsp; &nbsp;$11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;$11 = PPU Control 2 local copy<br />;Disable BKG layer display &#40;clear bit 3&#41;<br />D198 : 29 E7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;and&nbsp; &nbsp;#$E7&nbsp; &nbsp;;<br />;Update local copy and real PPU register&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />D19A : 8D 01 20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;sta&nbsp; &nbsp;$2001&nbsp; &nbsp;;<br /></div><br /><br />3. In the initial PPU setup:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;Set sprite clipping off, bkg clipping off, store local copy in $11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />C7EE : A9 06&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;lda&nbsp; &nbsp;#$06&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;<br />C7F0 : 8D 01 20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;sta&nbsp; &nbsp;$2001&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;<br />C7F3 : 85 11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;sta&nbsp; &nbsp;$11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />First, am I correct that excerpt one is disabling the sprites on pause? If so, why only the sprites and not the BG? I assume it's contingent upon what's currently loaded in variable $11 (PPU control 2 copy). And finally, why include this behavior? Is it to prevent players from 'planning ahead' while the game is paused? Does arcade DK behave this way? I assume there's no pause on the arcade game...

<br />I also set a breakpoint on the sprite rendering bit in $2001 being set to 0 and find it is indeed set to 0 on a pause.

<br />
<br />Good point. Usually the simpler explanation is the best. I was just leaning more toward the 'prevent planning' angle since the programmers didn't just create a pause overlay, similar to the 'Game Over' screen.

<br />
<br />My original guess before running the game to try anything was that they turned sprites off to clear the area where "PAUSED" would be printed on the screen so that you could see that it was paused.  But, there's no such indication given.  Then I thought perhaps it was done to reduce burn-in on the CRT.  The moveable objects, if left on screen for a long time during an extended pause, would be more noticeably burned-in than the background.  But then, I don't know the history of DK and whether or not the NES version was a direct arcade port.

<br />
<br />Interesting idea. Why are sprites more prone to burn vs. BG tiles?
<br />
<br />Not sure about the port process. Apparently DK wasn't coded in-house so Nintendo had to reverse engineer the arcade version to code their follow-up, DK Jr. Perhaps they had to do the same to port to the Famicom?

<br />Brighter. I don't have a copy of Donkey Kong in front of me to confirm, but I know older games tended to have black backdrops, and I seem to remember things in the background had more dark ($0x) and medium ($1x) colors, reserving bright ($2x) and light ($3x) colors for sprites. (As for grays, $00 is about the same as $1x, and $10 is about the same as $2x.)

Therefore, never writing to $4014 and if that happens the sprites disappear off the screen even though the sprites are not disabled from $2001. The OAM data will disintegrate after a few frames if not updated frequently updated. (I believe Ice climbers does the same thing.) To prove this, you could try a breakpoint at $4014, if its not being written to while paused.

<br />
<br />Donkey Kong writes to $4014 during pause.

<br />OAM only disintegrates when rendering is disabled. I'm not sure if that happens if only sprites are disabled (this is irrelevant though, since your theory is that they are not disabled at all). If rendering is not disabled, the PPU reading from the OAM is enough to keep that memory "alive", DMA's are not required for that. Also, if the OAM was fading, the sprites wouldn't simply disappear, they would glitch up.

<br />I am the one that disassembled partially the DK rom and uploaded it to romhacking. Nice to see that someone thought it would be interesting.
