<br />I don't know about any freeware programs that allows you to make SWFs. <a href="http://www.swishzone.com/index.php?area=products&amp;product=max&amp;tab=overview" class="postlink">SWiSH Max</a> is a good alternative if you suck at flash, but other than that, I have no idea.

<br /><a href="http://www.flashdevelop.org/" class="postlink">FlashDevelop</a> is great for creating SWF, but you have to do it all with code, since it doesn't have a stage you can visually edit. An animation like this would be pretty trivial to make, you'd just have to import the graphics (which you can make in GIMP, Inkscape, etc.) and write some simple code to move them around.

<br />Doesn't it need to be a combination of 7 files in order to be a true frankenfile? So I hereby propose the following format:
<br />
<br />File format: .frank
<br />
<br />This file format will be made out of a mandatory 7 files. The files must at least have a 60% difference that the emulator must check to ensure byte diversity. It will interlace the data in chunks of 32 bytes to 256 bytes. It will not give you any indication on what file the chunk belongs to, and the files are randomly chosen for each chunk. The header will consist of only 5 bytes instead of 16 to save diskspace, and they will be located at the following offsets in the file: 
<br />0x46 (F) - Mapper number (see iFrank mapper list)
<br />0x52 (R) - Horizontal or vertical mirroring (Yes, this needs a whole byte of its own)
<br />0x41 (A) - Bytes of WRAM (Does not support more than 255 bytes of WRAM at the moment)
<br />0x4e (N) - Number of 3KB PRG banks (3 is my favorite number)
<br />0x4b (K) - Reserved for future use
<br />
<br />Anyone up for it?

<br />I didn't invent "free" as in soil; Richard Stallman did. I didn't say "licensed games" because "licensed games" is also ambiguous; it could mean <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame" class="postlink">video game adaptations of an existing story, setting, or sports league</a>. Even "games licensed by Nintendo" is ambiguous because it includes four CD-i games and a few PC games including the game that spawned the WEEGEE meme.

<br />Just use the existing WRAM field. Whether it's in the same package as the mapper or not matters little, unless perhaps the mapper has the capacity for two separate WRAMs like the MMC5 does: one on the mapper and one external. To handle these, I'd treat WRAM as "WRAM additional to that which comes with the mapper's base configuration". In this sense, MMC6 has additional WRAM because mapper 4's base configuration is PRG ROM + CHR ROM + no WRAM, but MMC5 does not (unless it's a Koei game or the like) because 1024 bytes of ExRAM at $5C00 are part of the base configuration.

<br />
<br />bsdiff is ridiculously complicated for a patching format. Writing even a patch applier, let alone a patch creator, is a nightmare. The format itself internally uses compression, which was already an issue for .fc.zip for some.
<br />
<br />All that's really needed is IPS+checksum+&gt;16MB (for non-NES games.)
<br />And if you want insertion, deletion; then you basically want a sliding-window approach. It need not be any more complicated than LZ.

I don't believe in such a thing as an "official" name. There is too much crazy stuff you could go either way on. I had to create a giant rulesheet just to get myself to make an objective decision. There are games like Robot Gyro a.k.a. Gyro a.k.a. Gyromite. Disney puts "Disney's" before the title of every game. Should that be included in the beginning, end, or at all? There are all kinds of romaji arguments.

<br />
<br />What was the minimum amount of WRAM an MMC3 board could have above 0? What was a valid increment?
<br />
<br />I need to research this more, because it seems like the iNES idea is impossibly cookie cutter. It's trying to consolidate the commonalities between boards into numbers, and then what it can't consolidate, it's creating special attributes for. Why did 4-screen mirroring boards get an attribute field and not their own mapper id? Because it's too small of a difference to waste a mapper number on? Why do we want to reserve a field for a technique used by two games?
