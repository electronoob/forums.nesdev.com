		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi guys!
<br />
<br />I thought I'd share some AV modding that we over att Famicomworld are experimenting with. Maybe some of you could try the same on your toploaders since the old Famicom and toploader are basicly the same machine.
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.famicomworld.com/forum/index.php?topic=4713.0">http://www.famicomworld.com/forum/index ... pic=4713.0</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />The is the schematics we're currently using
<br /><img src="http://www.gnys.se/da_bear/famicom/kyuusaku.gif" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />For the trasistor - reusing the one in your NES/Famicom is the best from what I have found out. It needs to be desoldered and the trace from PPU #21 needs to be cut or removed completely. (As stated earlier in this thread)
<br />
<br />Build the new circuit on a separate board and connect PPU #21 and the new composite circuit with a <strong>shielded cable to minimize video interference</strong>.
<br />
<br /><strong>Next you need to add a 47uF - 100uF capacistor between PPU #22 (SYNC) and #20 (GND)</strong> &lt;-- This is like magic and removes - if not all, most of the vertical bars.
<br />
<br />I've done this on several Famicoms with good result. Some machines give more jailbars then others and with the cap over #22-#20 they dissapear or become wery faint depending on how much interference there is.
<br />
<br />
<br />Maybe we could support each other.

<br />
<br />Hey Bregalad,
<br />
<br />I got my hands on another Top Loader, and I decided to do a clean AV mod on it.  I initially did r73942's mod, and then your mod (including the resistor values both you and r73942 used).  In both cases, faint vertical lines can still be seen on an NTSC system. 
<br />
<br />In fact, with your mod and resistor values, the video is too bright.  It washes out the colors with NTSC.  Using r73942's resistor values + adding the 220uF cap instead of R2 made the colors really nice.  It's 1 shade darker than front loader, but looks sharper (but faint lines can still be seen)
<br />
<br />I tested the video quality using SMB1.  It's probably the most brutal game in showing you the faint lines right away (the blue sky).
<br />
<br />I think the issue is with the video amp being where it is.  It's still picking up noise from somewhere between the PPU and it (which is crazy, because I got  a single wire going directly from pin 21 to amp in my hack, with the wire being off the PCB, in the air!).
<br />
<br />As much as I try, it seems having an external amp is the only way to go.
<br />
<br />Will try this tomorrow.

<br />Possible solutions to this is to use a GOOD power-supply with as little noise in it as possible. Then replace powerline caps inside the NES for bigger and better ones. Adding a few extra caps between GND and power also helps.

<br />Is this a guess, or do you have some testing you've done that you can share? Have you been able to remove the noise by not modifying the video amp circuitry?

<br />If someone will tell you to cut traces or desolder transistor... well here is lots of "experts" floating around making this(i saved this image and will reupload, if owner will delete original). Wait, 100pF ceramic capacitors on power lines? facepalm.jpg
<br /><img src="http://www.gnys.se/da_bear/famicom/fccaps.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />instead of <a href="http://i40.tinypic.com/28sy03t.jpg" class="postlink">this</a> On this PCB sound wiring was not finished at moment, when i took photo. SMD capacitors are 10uF. And this is not final revision.
<br />
<br />
<br />AGAIN. DO NOT CUT ANY TRACES. YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

<br />Rest:
<br />
<br />I build the external circuit as suggested on top of page 10.  I tried to run the wires as cleanly as possible, minimizing lengths, minimizing noise.  I still was not able to rid of the lines.  
<br />
<br />I then decided to compare to the front loader. To my surprise, my front loader also had lines!!  (DAMN LCD TV's!!! They show all the flaws in systems made for CRT!)  Here's how I compare a modified top loader to a front loader (giving up at this point unless someone figures out how to rid of noise in front loader as well!)
<br />
<br />Front Loader AV (connected to LCD TV):
<br />- faint lines (about 30-35 across the screen) 
<br />- somewhat noisy output (TV shows some diagonal faint lines running)
<br />
<br />Top Loader AV (same TV):
<br />- faint lines (same as front loader a tad more pronounced then the front loader)
<br />- no diagonal noise
<br />- color perfect to the front loader
<br />- volume about 80% of the front loader! (have to bring volume up to play same game)
<br />
<br />Anyone have similar findings?

<br />
<br />And as if that is not enough, the AV Famicom that everyone claims to be "perfect" is NOT perfect. That one also has noise in it, not so much as the NES2/Famicom but it's still there.

<br />
<br />Mixing analog and digital signals is always a hassle and if the power supply is not well filtered (that is, a capacity needs to be present very close to the VDD and GND of every digial IC) it can lead to problems.
