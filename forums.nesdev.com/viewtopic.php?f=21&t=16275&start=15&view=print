Certainly I can see that they'd interrelated, such as with mplayer's &quot;mcdeint&quot; deinterlacer which uses motion compensation to produce plausible lies for the missing scanlines, and the same motion compensation data would also be used to generate the entire missing frame for 120Hz rendering.

With no background scrolling, the TV's heuristic decides that the video was converted from 30p and matches pairs of fields to produce 30 frames per second. Once the background is scrolling, the TV's heuristic decides that the video is truly interlaced (with each field at a separate point in time) and switches to something more complicated that produces 60 frames per second.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Many TVs will take a 15KHz signal and assume it is 480i. As a result, they will render the incoming lines into alternating fields. The changes may still be viewed at 60fps in total, but only every other line gets updated on every refresh. This is the worst-case scenario, in my opinion. Comb-like artifacts are seen on moving objects:<br /><br /><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Interlaced_video_frame_%28car_wheel%29.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Some TVs will weave these two into a full frame, updating the actual display only one two fields have been captured. This gives a 30fps effective refresh rate, where the resulting image is either a comb-artifacted blend of two frames (awful) or a 50% blend between two frames (semi-awful, old YouTube style). This mode is appropriate for interlaced video for which the source material was shot / composed at 30fps (e.g. Many television shows)<br /><br />Some TVs will bob-deinterlace by only displaying the relevant field. This gets you a 60fps display with no comb lines, but it will wobble a bit (not the worst). This is the appropriate mode for interlaced video that is updating the source material at 60fps (e.g. Super Smash Bros Melee).<br /><br />Finally, some TVs will treat 240p as only an even/odd field, and not try to deinterlace anything. This is ideal.
