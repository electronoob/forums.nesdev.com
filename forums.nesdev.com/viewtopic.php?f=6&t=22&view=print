<br />
<br />Because that's what happened with the first version of NT2.  It worked, except for some unemulated features which screwed things up majorly.  Bananmos had to re-write the stuff (turned out well because he added features too, heheh).  Well, it wasn't publicly available the time, but you can see releasing it early without hardware tests would've resulted in a lot of music that would've sounded fine on NESticle but horrible on the real system (and would've been incompatible with later, properly working versions anyways).
<br />
<br />If that happened, Bananmos could've been in danger of getting beatings from the musicians that relied the program.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

<br />The triangle sounds better on the real system.  Might just be my PC config, but the first triangle note pops on FCEU, sounds totally clean on NES.  Can't tell if it does that in the .ogg, the noise would drown it out.

<br />It popped on FCEU, but only on reset (F10). It sounded OK with a power cycle (F11).
<br />
<br />Next steps for me: <ul><li>Define a sequence format and add a sequence player. </li><li>Make instrument and sequence editing tools for Windows, unlike the reboot-to-DOSness that is NT2 on a modern Windows PC. </li><li>Add DMC support. </li><li>Add the ability for a program using the library to start a note and lock the channel until the note has finished; this is apparently how sound effects work in real games. </li><li>Encapsulate it into a reasonably self-contained library. </li><li>Write readable English documentation, not the engrish mess that plagued the MCK scene. </li><li>Put it under a free software license. </li></ul> Anyway, how important is it to musicians reading this that pitch bends work on a granularity finer than semitones? Slides for triangle kick drums typically move at least one semitone per frame.

It works in all nsf players, and I know it's bad practice, but I'm 80% confident it'll work on the real NES, since it works everywhere else. Reason it's 80% instead of like 90% is because I modded the code slightly to implement sound effects, and to add some features. I don't know if that'll work on the nes, but I sure as heck am hoping so. I could give someone the nsf to test it on the nes, but I probably won't until later.
<br />
<br />Anyway, what are you guys using to open ogg files?

<br />
<br />For the pitch bends, if anyone wants to do a slow or shallow one, it would almost have to be a lot finer than a semitone.  Like playing a guitar, it's probably more common to bend the string and stay in the same fret instead of sliding up/down the fretboard, heheh.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi. I should possibly be posting this in the newbies section, but the fact is I am at a sub-newbie level when it comes to the engineering, programming, etc.. The only thing I would elevate myself above that level in is music. I am a long time musician and fan of the soundtrack of my childhood- nintendo music. Anyway, I wa wondering how close people are to creating an idiot-friendly piece of software/hardware that can be plugged into a nintendo on one end, a midi keyboard on the other, and be used to create and play nintendo music in real time? 
<br />I remember a dilbert comic where a bunch of BA graduates were brainstorming solutions to some problem, and coming up with magical answers like a cloak of invisibility, and then passing it on to the engineers to take care of the boring stuff such as design and implementation. Consider me one such art geek.
<br />Anything in the works? I would be a very co-operative beta tester if anyone was interested.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Given that hardware for Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS homebrew was easier to get at the time, I decided to wait before making a serious NES music engine until the PowerPak was released. It was in short supply for the first year, but once I got my hands on one at the end of 2008, I made the first version of what is now known as <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=13589" class="postlink">Pently</a>.<br /><br />And by now, there are a lot of users willing to run tests using PowerPak, EverDrive, or INL-Retro, which are about as easy to get and use as the GBA and DS flash solutions of old.<br /><br />So I guess we can consider this case closed.
