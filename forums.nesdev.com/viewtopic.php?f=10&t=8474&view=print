<br />
<br />I wanted to find a manufacturer that will make the PCB board of the snes games compatible for the snes and ready for the EPROMS with the hombrew to be soldered!
<br />
<br />
<br />I tried Retrousb, but they only have for NES...I think,
<br />
<br />Im a noob at this, so please share some direction or info! 
<br />
<br />Thank you!

<br />
<br />The reason RetroUSB doesn't have them is possibly because the #1 use of a SNES board accepting eprom or flashroms would be bootlegs.

But I know for a fact that RetroZone is capable of releasing SNES games as he has constructed them. You'd have to contact him about it, but it would be better to have substantial progress to show before contacting him.
<br />
<br />You should know that developing an iPhone game is a lot different than a SNES game.

<br />Off topic question-

But anyway, there's no trouble releasing stuff for the NES/SNES, but unless you sneak in an SNES game and then get a developer license to get into WiiWare, good luck getting it on the Wii or anything current. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I wish you luck dude.
