		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is sort of an ad, but just as much I consider this a community service for newbies.  I'm not in this for a profit but if anyone thinks this violates forum rules please don't hesitate to take it down.
<br />
<br />I have quite a few dev carts laying around for my own use  I basically don't need anywhere near as many as I have, but find I kind of enjoy making them...  I've gotten to the point where I almost never even burn myself on the NES boards (the PCBs never really got burned, just me. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> )
<br />
<br />I'd be willing to cook some up for some forum members not so skilled at soldering and have an ample supply of donor carts and/or third party boards plus associated EPROM/EEPROMS and other chips to make them in the following configurations:
<br />
<br />NROM
<br />CNROM
<br />UOROM
<br />AOROM
<br />MMC1 (pretty much whatever you want).
<br />
<br />Turn around is probably about 1-3 business days (depending on whether I need to make it or have it), and I'd ask for a price of $45 to cover build time/labor, parts, and shipping to most of the world.  I can work with people who are strapped for cash though, just that's my asking price.
<br />
<br />I can also do special order boards, including MMC5, whatever.  Just understand it will be a special order and I'll probably ask for more (think like $70 for MMC5).  I also might have to refund your money if I simply can't find the parts, but I'll do that promptly in most cases.
<br />
<br />All boards feature a nicely cut "perfect fit" hole for the ZIF sockets easy access, and for those with board controlled mapping, a toggle switch that toggles between H and V mirroring with labels.  The carts are stripped of labels and will ship to you with nothing minus my own little logo that can easily be removed.  Your free to customize.
<br />
<br />Hope someone takes me up on this, as I'm actually finding myself enjoying the hardware part more than the software part.  Guess that makes me weird? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Thanks for reading, PM me if interested.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah it's advertising, but it's far from being spam.  There's no way around hardware costing money, and if it's potentially beneficial to NES developers, then it seems fine to me.
<br />
<br />Though I can see why it'd be kind of hazy to draw the line, if someone registered entirely to come in here and sell something like a service (cart modding) or commodity (tools, chips), even that was relevant, they'd be seen as an "outsider" and probably met with a high degree of suspicion unless they were reputable and also had unbeatable prices. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> 
<br />
<br />But yeah speaking of prices, I think they are a little high, but it's totally within reason (if that makes any sense).  For comparison, for a short time several years ago I was offering built UNROM carts with a FlashROM + case (not cut ones like yours tho) for $22 (CopyNES compatible for writing, or could be socketed).  With a new PCB and all.  Demand was so low (probably since I'm averse to doing "reproductions/bootlegs"), that it was nearly a waste of time if it wasn't so fun and educational to do for myself.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />   I sold 2 or 3 of them.  Not that I advertised it much.  I'm sure by now there's more hardware-averse people that may be interested in a service like this.  Though using socketed EPROMs for development is pretty unfriendly, I'd definitely say to wire them up for flash chips.

<br />
<br />Yeah, it was the same thing for me here too.  I pretty much dived right into the hardware thing as a newb, after a little coding burnout.  I soon found out that I could combine those 2 things together in new and exciting ways by putting a PIC MCU on an NES cart (Squeedo project), heheh.

<br />
<br />Actually, some of my stuff is parallel EEPROMs, which should be a little better (got sick of erasing).  Just nothing above CNROM capacity.  I could aquire a flash inventory, just need to be sure there's an interest first.  If no ones adverse to drop ordering parts, I'll do flashrom as well.
<br />
<br />And the prices are pretty negotiable, esspecially to those living in the US and/or wanting multiple carts.  I just wanted to set a baseline so it's worth my time at least, but it's hardly fixed.  As I said, I'll ship just about anywhere with that price provided the customs don't eat NES carts.

<br />
<br />Just thought I would add, I also can offer a Copy-NES installation service.  Price would be similar to that of the dev cart, however you would supply the NES and CopyNES boards.
