<br />I mean, can I take a busted cart and use the 72 pins of the board and connect a 60pins connector on there?
<br />I was wondering that cause I have some 60pins carts and the only way I can play em atm is by using that crappy damn Famiclone I have (shapped like a steeringwheel and the cart hang out the back)

<br />So I assume 'Yes' you can build a 60-&gt;72 pin converter.

<br />Unless you had a PCB factory made, it'd be a lot of soldering, and you'd have to get a 72 pin connector and a 60 pin card edge of the right size.

<br />Those, if you're lucky, can be obtained from some Gyromite/Stack-Up cartridges (which actually contained Famicom cartridge PCBs connected to a 60-&gt;72 converter complete with a lockout chip).

<br />
<br />Is it possible to mass produce these? Lots of people would want to buy them.  Would it be feasible to modify a 72-&gt;60 pin converter (which are sold everywhere) to work the other way around?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />60-&gt;72 pin were very easy to come by until a few years ago, in fact 72-&gt;60 were far harder since the there was far less of a market when Famiclones weren't sold in the Americas and Europe (this was to the point where impatient people were spending 3 figures USD on one)
<br />
<br />It's true that production has ceased for perhaps 10 years but I think 60-&gt;72 still shouldn't be very hard to find if you're willing to pay ~$20-30 for one. Now with Kevtris' CICLONE perhaps it is time to start producing new ones which are top-loader safe.

<br />As long as you can buy an exact equivalent of the FC's 60-pin female connector and get them made in a decent plastic case, you can produce as many converters as you want and make money with it.

<br />Do you understand? Wasn't GameAxe for Famicom? Why would a bunch of 60-&gt;72s be around for that?
