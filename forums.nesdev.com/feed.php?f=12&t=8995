Alright I think that's about enough (damn I sound like a parent, haha).  The bloke admitted he was stupid, he gets it.  Don't ask me why he edited his post; I edit my posts all the time (usually seconds after I post them, I'm horrible about detecting typos/mistakes until AFTER I've clicked post, hahaha).<br /><br />Regardless, *I* can't even follow what's going on in this thread any longer.  *laugh*  :-)  As such, and given that people are kinda frustrated, I'm going to lock this one down.

Pichichi010, why did you edit and delete all the info about you burning the proto rom for the scammer and the fake proto auction?! It make the thread impossible to understand for people that just came in and also, I told you I had made a warning post on another forum that was pointing here, now it just look stupid. God<br /><br />I'm annoyed, you even managed to make your warning post at nintendo age confusing for some people. With one reply from one of their member saying ''Man that sucks! I'm not a big proto guy but a Steven Seagal proto? I'm in <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> '' Why don't you clearly state the name of the proto in the subject title of your post, then clearly explain that the guy asked you to burn eprom with the proto rom on it, that you were stupid enough to think he was legit and did as he asked without thinking much about the implication, he then slapped them on a proto board and sell it as the genuine Final Option PCB. I think that you're almost generating publicity for the guy with the confusing post you made and the fact that you removed the original content from that thread. And on top of that you are replying to your thread asking to make the post private? What the hell?<br /><br />You made a big stupid mistake, now handle it properly instead of piling up more crap on the mess you created <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> Continue acting that way and I reckon you won't find anymore people willing to answer your post or help you with anything here. I know at least I and some other already won't be helping you with anything NAND flash, repro or eprom related anytime soon.<br /><br />Edit: OMG, you're reaching new height Pachichi010, why did you delete all the text in your Nintendo Ages warning post?! I really can't believe all the moronic decision you're making.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4859">SkinnyV</a> — Thu Jun 14, 2012 4:30 pm</p><hr />

Pichi, you're the one trying to hire people to make a game, but acting like a 5 year old with !!!URGENT!!! after messages and garbage. I also don't have SNES programming experience, but I am one of the people here that do have the skills to do something, I've got 1 full NES game and a few test ROMS under my belt more than you, so what have you brought to the table since you're doing much more than me?

Seriously, try to scare him saying you had an issue with 2 of the address line of your programmer and all the dump you made and the chip you programmed have a bit of corruption. Since he's got his listing on ebay already he will be too scared to have the sale messed up and might bring the rom to be programmed again. You don't have much to lose. You could fix your mistake in an hilarious way imo.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4859">SkinnyV</a> — Thu Jun 14, 2012 3:12 pm</p><hr />

Yes it was a bit dumb of my part. He said he bought an eprom programmer and a uv light box to fix the steven seagal proto. Proto i was to intrigued by BT32v eproms to begin wiith. Honest mistake.<br /><br />I whish i could program a snes rom saying that lol. I guess i should stop trusting ppl to much. Anyway i reported the auction and post it on nintendoage.com cause there are a lot of proto colectors there that might try to bid. Oh well cant much about it now. <br /><br /><br />Now lets try to salvage these roms to see what games are in them<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5138">pichichi010</a> — Thu Jun 14, 2012 2:37 pm</p><hr />

IMO, it wasn't really smart of you to agree to his request of burning the proto rom since you barely knew the guy. How can someone accidentally erase a prototype eprom in a UV box for like 15 min, I mean, c'mon... And why would he own a UV eraser without owning a eprom programmer? Also, if you try to contact the seller, you get : ''We're sorry we couldn't find an answer for you. Unfortunately, this seller is not able to respond to your question. We suggest reviewing the item again to see if your answer is in the seller's listing.''<br /><br />Why don't you try to tell him you had an issue with the programmer and there's good chance part of the dump is corrupted and to bring it back to you to correct it. Then you erase the eprom and your burn a rom that will display a message on screen when he'll try it saying it's bad to rip people off on ebay;) That would be so awesome if you would pull it off. I bet he'll do it again with some of the proto board he found. I saw a dozen of sega genesis prototype pcb on ebay for dirt cheap a few month ago and remember thinking how that it would be used to pull that kind of crap.<br /><br />Edit: Since Pichichi010 decided to cover his ass and hide his recent stupid act by editing his post and removing info, here's what happened. That guy who bought the proto on ebay told him he owned a Steven Segal: The Final option SNES prototype but ''accidentally'' erased all 4 (that's right people, 4 chips that accidentally got removed from their respective IC sockets, then accidentally got left in a powered UV eraser for at least 15 to 20 min <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> ) and asked him if he could burn back the prototype rom onto the cart to keep as collector item for himself. Of course, a few days after he agreed the guy listed the prototype as genuine for sale on ebay.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4859">SkinnyV</a> — Thu Jun 14, 2012 1:47 pm</p><hr />

I think it's something important to do to be sure of the dump integrity if you were using a budget programmer like a parallel willem. Also, one other curious thing is those string of text you can find in a few of the dump that Pichichi010 mentioned earlier. A quick google search reveal that the string ''EAMG RV CSG 94'' appear in what seem to be the Sonic Cracker Beta dump but I can't locate the string by myself using a good dump of the game and the one from that web site doesn't seem to load on emulator.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4859">SkinnyV</a> — Wed Jun 13, 2012 10:34 pm</p><hr />

You are missing a few chip dump, only 8 dump were provided out of 11 eprom. Since all the eprom were mixed, there is no way to do much without all the dump.<br />After looking at the dump a bit I found that bigithinkclay2rom4.bin is a bad dump or the chip was empty when read. blacktape.BIN and BT32V 62295.BIN contain almost 90% the same data. Also, I'm not sure what gave you the idea some eprom were from Clayfighter 2 but I can't find much similarity in data for now. We would really need the rest of the chip in order to do anything. Also, D4S might be able to help a lot providing that he has any interest at all in prototype.<br /><br />Personally, I would be disappointed if I was the one having purchase those pcb.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4859">SkinnyV</a> — Wed Jun 13, 2012 5:04 pm</p><hr />
