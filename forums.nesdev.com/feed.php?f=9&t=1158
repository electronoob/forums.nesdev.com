I post funny sentences? Cool. I didn't know. But anyways, yeah, I think buying a 72 pin connector wouldn't be neccissary unless your connecter was totally broken. If you can just kind of push the connector back in the connector, then that's what I'd do. I don't know what I'd do to keep it in there, though.<br /><br />I haven't ever heard of the pin in the connector falling out, that's kind of a big thing, I thought at least. I don't know what to do about that, besides replacing the connector. I myself am lacking knowledge of NES hardware, so that's all I'd think of.

Oh god! That's bad. Um, you'd probably want to replace your 72 pin connector. At first when I heard to replace your 72 pin connector, I was like "Huh? I can't just pull this thing off, I'll wreck the whole thing!" <br /><br />But if you take your NES apart all the way to the motherboard, then you can just pull it away from the board. I've never had the problem where a pin falls off the connector! Is it like really tight, so when you pull a cart out, it takes the pin out with it? Or what? <br /><br />If your pin falls off of a NES cart, I think all hope is lost for the cart. Unless it still works, then I guess not. But the cart connector is a different story. You can buy 72 pin connectors off of ebay, there's alot of them.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Tue Feb 21, 2006 1:25 pm</p><hr />

The connectors, in the console, where you slide the cart in. One of the pins was pulled out and I'm afraid it will happen again (as I've heard of it a few times before) and ruin the whole thing with time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Feb 21, 2006 1:03 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, I own 3 NESs, and 2 clones. Both are Yobo Clones. I have one that I got for Christmas, which was a 72 pin one, and another which is a 60 pin one. <br /><br />I was looking online for a honey bee adapter, and I had trouble finding one, so I just bought a cheap $30 famiclone online. Yeah, then for some reason, they just gave me back my money that I spent on the famiclone. They just gave it back. No reason. I have my famiclone, it's pretty much just like a free famiclone. I already spent the money they gave back, so, there's nothing I can do about that.<br /><br />Hey, if they complain to me that I spent the money they gave back to me, it's not my fault that the payment got reversed back on to my simon giftcard. I just think in that scenario, I'm a lucky bastard.<br /><br />It was also a long time ago, so I don't think it matters anymore.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Tue Feb 21, 2006 12:36 pm</p><hr />

Here in Brazil, the "Phantom System" and the "Turbo Game" were very popular back in the late 80's early 90's, before the real NES was officially sold in 1994. I don't think the NES was ever as successful as those 2, or even some others. Today you can buy different kinds of clones at stores (I got a dynacom/dynavision recently), and also many others at places (don't know how I'd call these places in english) where a lot of stands sell a hell lot of pirate crap, from China, mostly.<br /><br />I own 3 clones and now a real NES. At first I thought it would be enough to have a clone, but with time I learned that they may not be 100% compatible with the NES. They can produce different sound, different image and behave differently in some cases. Nothing that could bother a kid that just wanted to play games in the 80's, but for us developers it can be a big deal.<br /><br />My 3 clones are:<br />1. a Dynavision, 60-pin with 1 turbo controller and pistol. This one is very nice, has very good picture quality and all. Never had any problems with it. Except that my crapy 72-pin to 60-pin adapter won't fit in it.<br />2. a Pokefami, a japanese handheld NES clone that can be plugged to the TV. It is also very nice. The controls could be more precise, it is hard to press the directional in one steady direction. But you can plug external controllers, don't know what kind though. When rendering is turned off, it shows a lot of random colored noise, but only in the lcd screen, in the TV it works as expected.<br />3. a Turbo Game, wich has both 72-pin and 60-pin slots. The video quality is kinda bad when using composite but OK when using RF. I can't find any controllers that work on it, so it's kinda useless.<br /><br />I was happy with all of them, but I felt that for real NES development I'd eventually need a NES, as I plan to move to testing my stuff on hardware soon.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Feb 21, 2006 9:06 am</p><hr />

Hi guys. I finally bought my first NES. Some scratches here and there, but it is working very well, and the video quality is very good. It's not a Nintendo original, it's one of those manifactured here in Brazil, by Playtronic (released Nintendo consoles here) in 1994. Maybe these were just assembled here, I don't know. It's a regular front-loader.<br /><br />It was a little difficult to get some games to run (damn blinking red light!), and I felt a little resistence at the right side when removing a cart, then I noticed one of the pins in the cart slot inside the NES was a bit bent/twisted. I managed to push it back to place, more or less. I didn't play anymore after this, so I don't know how well this worked.<br /><br />Now, why would a thing like this happen? How could a cartridge pull the pin? I just can't see that happening... Does it happen often? What would you recommend in this case? You know, stuff that long time NES owners would know like the back of their hands... tips for good care of a NES. =)<br /><br />I plan to get started on playing stuff on hardware, now that I finally got myself a real NES! =)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Feb 20, 2006 9:46 pm</p><hr />
