I don't want it to be relying on differences between the emulators and PowerPak on which I tested it and the actual hardware. So I'll need someone to rip up one of these NES or Famicom games, solder in EPROM sockets.<br /><ul><li>Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! </li><li>Punch-Out!! </li><li>Famicom Wars </li><li>Fire Emblem </li><li>Fire Emblem Gaiden </li></ul><br />Then try <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=120164#p120164" class="postlink">Holy Diver Batman</a> on it and tell us what four-digit code it produces.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The MMC2/MMC4 test kernel in Holy Diver Batman runs in RAM, meaning it could be turned into a hot-swap test ROM. But I'm not quite ready to spend money on doing so myself. To test a hot-swap ROM, I'd have to mod my own front-loading NES to disable the CIC and then buy a copy of MTPO.

I just want to avoid this being like NEStress, where a test passes on inaccurate emulators but fails on hardware.<br /><br />On the other hand, it might be better to delay running the test until I've had a chance to look over it manually to add specific result codes that distinguish MMC2-style behavior from MMC4-style behavior.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Tepples, I have the Playchoice version of Punch Out, in which the PRG is EPROM and CHR is maskROM (it's the only Playchoice game that isn't identical to it's NES release, it uses WRAM as well).  If you don't mind remapping the character set and bank select to suit it, I could test it.  I have a batch of EPROMs I'll be erasing next week, I could do it then.<br /><br />If you want to go that route, there was a pretty cool custom charset macro posted in this thread:<br /><a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=11112&amp;start=15" class="postlink">http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=11112&amp;start=15</a>
