Just seems highly inefficient to me.  All that address reading/writing to modify a single attribute byte.</div><br />A common solution to that problem is keeping a copy of the attribute tables in RAM at all times. I do this in my scrolling engine.

Since the PPU is the one that generates NMIs though, it has the power to disable them.<br /><br />EDIT: In other words, the CPU is always forced to accept NMIs, but if no other component is generating them, there's nothing to accept.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Any experience on the best way to store large maps?<br /><br />As my own NxM array or consecutively packed single screens/native name tables ?<br /><br />Name table approach seems like a pain having to compute tile locations across table boundaries so I'm leaning against it.  Only thing going for it is making and exporting single screens of data is trivial while arbitrary NxM map makers with NES attribute alignment has poor existing tools.  I suppose I could write a tool to interleave 1024 byte nam files into a single array.<br /><br />Including an additional NxM byte array for tile properties, I can quickly see PRGROM getting eaten alive as well for large contiguous scrolling maps. As in 8k bank switchable areas for even a small 1x4 or 2x2 map.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />LZ and its special case RLE generally need a lot of RAM into which to decompress levels. That's fine if you can afford to put an extra SRAM on your game's board. There are two solutions, however, that work with very limited RAM like that of the NES. One is meta-metatiles, used in various ways by Blaster Master, Mega Man series, Sonic the Hedgehog series, The Legend of Zelda, and Super Mario Land. In this, each metatile is made up of smaller metatiles. Another is object-based level encoding, used by Super Mario Bros. series. In this, a map is a list of objects that have width and height of often multiple tiles, and rendering an area consists of determining which objects overlap it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, also forgot to mention. The way it scrolls matters too. If it scrolls 8-ways, you'll probably never get a great low-ram usage and speed out of it. horizontal? LZ might work best, but then RLE with 15 different metatile streams with extra RAM to buffer the next screen write would probably be okay. Although still LZ would probably be better. But it all depends on your situation. You have to decide whatt works best for your situation and implement it all yourself.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Also I'd guess that you're not doing something else exactly correct because when I run it on the <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=8084&amp;start=30" class="postlink">NESDEV1</a> I get some funky results with your *ORIGINAL* crush.  Basially I have to run some other ROM first that appears to be prepping the PPU properly, before I can play your ROM.  Otherwise if I just run your ROM initially I get a bunch of garbage/static.  If I prep things with a different ROM I see your visual effects but the colors and tiles are mixed up a bit but it *kinda* works.  FYI You usually don't see these types of issues with the powerpak since it sets up the PPU and everything for you before your game even starts.  Are you waiting long enough before writing to the PPU?  Or clearing $2002 before polling?  When I run your latest version I can't get it to do anything, just blank screen...<br /><br />Based on the latest reports I guess it works on the powerpak though. I still have to reset to start your game.  I don't think you have to hit reset on the powerpak.<br /><br />Not sure if it helps or you're concerned about all this but I saw <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=8889" class="postlink">similar issues</a> when making my first demo here.  My problems resolved after hitting reset.  For your ROM I see a different tile set every time I hit reset...  Eventually If I hit reset enough I'm left with white screen.<br /><br />It's possible I've got an issue somewhere in my hardware but my MMC3 has been pretty solid for awhile now.  If you're interested I could try it on other devices I have sitting around as well.
