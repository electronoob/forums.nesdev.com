		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi all, this is probably a stupid question but i've come up against a brick wall and am looking for advice, you guys look like the right place to turn for NES related issues so here it am, lets see if anyone can help.<br />So i'm in the UK and wanted a Powerglove, obviously PAL units are the most expensive so i took that option off the table, i bought a Famicom glove instead because i have a Twin Famicom, this works well with the glove on Famicom carts and also on my PAL carts (inserted using a 72pin - 60 pin adapter) though of course those play in a sped up format. I bought a copy of Super Glove Ball because obviously its a game designed specifically with the Powerglove in mind and i figured it'd be fun to play but this is where i've run into a problem;<br />The game is only available as a US release as far as i'm aware but it plays fine on my Twin Famicom (again using the adapter) with the built in control pad, obviously there is no speed up as both the Famicom and US NES work at the same speed so the game is playing as it should. However when i attach the glove and try to play my luck seems to run out, the glove beeps to start up, then beeps 5 times which i assume indicates that the automatic programming from the cartridge has been uploaded to the glove (as this uses a special program contained on the cartridge)? The LEDs seem to be responding correctly but i can't get the game past the title screen, it wants me to press start but ignores the start button on the glove (which i know works in other games) if i press start on the control pad the game starts but ignores the glove and is controlled by the pad instead.<br />Obviously i'd like to be able to use the Powerglove with this game to really get a feel for it but i'm out of ideas, i can only assume that it's because i'm using a Famicom rather than a NES and unlike other games this one does not get the glove to emulate a pad but instead uses the glove as a unique controller and theres some kind of problem for the software running on the famicom?<br />Any help anyone can provide would be greatly appreciated, my technical knowledge is limited but i can follow instructions, thanks for your time and thanks in advance for any help you can give<br /><br />Matt

If you've got something like an Everdrive or PowerPak it's really simple, otherwise you'd need to burn an EPROM and solder it into the cartridge.<br /><br />We might need to know about the adapter you're connecting the PowerGlove through. Does it connect all the data lines from the NES controllers, or does it just connect the controller's D0 to the famicom expansion port's D1? (Do you know what kind of adapter it is, have a schematic, or a multimeter to test it with?)

Should be pretty easy to look at the differences between the two BSB versions and create a patch for SGB.

Find all the $4016 reads, and patch them to do D0 = D0 | D1, though finding them all might be tricky, since I can't seem to find a debugging emulator that emulates the Power Glove. :S Might not be too bad though.

Yeah i've got a multimeter if there's anything specific you wanted me to look at?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Okay, after some digging around, it seems like the Power Glove doesn't use the other data lines anyway, everything goes in through the standard $4016 write (which is why you can see it being &quot;programmed&quot;), and everything comes out through D0 normally, but D1 on your Famicom, which is why it will work with some games, but not the US made Glove Ball.<br /><br />Presuming this, I think a patch to Glove Ball would be straightforward.

(sorry i'm probably being very thick here, it just strikes me that when i've edited other types of code (mainly HTML in the past) find and replace is an easy way of not missing any references, but of course this is jsut my simplistic view of an undoubtedly complex task  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Controllers normally return data in bit 0 (D0), but Famicom controllers plugged to the expansion port return data in bit 1 (D1). &quot;D&quot; stands for &quot;data&quot; I believe.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Lastly if all you need to do is change all D0 references to D1 is there not some sort of find and replace option you could use in whatever editor you use for this job?</div><br />Not really, because each game uses different code for reading input... there are literally hundreds of ways of checking the value of a bit, so there isn't a constant string you can search for. Also, the code you have to replace the original with could be larger than the code being replaced, meaning you couldn't simply overwrite the original, you'd have to shift things a bit in the ROM to make room for the new code.<br /><br />Each game has to be individually debugged, and once you find its input reading routine you have to redesign it so that bit 1 isn't ignored and make sure it fits in the ROM. It's not a difficult process at all, but it's not simple to the point where it can be automated.

It might require a few tries to hunt down all the input code. If you get yourself a flash cart I'd be willing to give it a try for you, and others here might be willing if I were unavailable by then. It will probably take a few tries, since we can't really test it on an emulator.<br /><br />2. Yes, if you wired the powerglove directly into the wired controller port, it should just work. (In theory.) The NES has two extra pins on controller 1 (D3 and D4) (<a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Controller_port_pinout" class="postlink">pinout</a>) that the Famicom didn't have, but almost no controllers use them, and I don't think the powerglove does either, so it's largely not a problem.<br /><br />If you look for &quot;NES extension cable&quot; you can find a cable with a female/male NES controller connector that would be easy to use for this. Just cut the famicom wired cables in the middle, and solder them up to the ends of the extension cable. This would let you use NES controllers (and the powerglove) with your Famicom, and make your wired controllers detachable.<br /><br />3. I know you said your powerglove works with games you've tried, but do you have any games made outside of Japan like Solar Jetman or Battletoads that you could plug in with the 72-60 pin adapter? Many non-Famicom releases don't listen for D1; these ones in particular should only work with the wired controllers.

Any developer that worked with Nintendo would have been told to listen for D1 in their controller read code for Famicom expansion controllers, but outside of Japan it wasn't necessary, and if you were an unlicensed developer you might have had no way of knowing about it.<br /><br />Battletoads US doesn't do it, but they later made a release in Japan that does (with modified levels too, one of the few cases where the Japanese version is actually the easier one). Solar Jetman doesn't, and never had a release in Japan. I think the Codemasters games have this problem too. Can't remember any more examples offhand.
