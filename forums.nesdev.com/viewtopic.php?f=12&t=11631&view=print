		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello! I am fairly new to SNES programing (and programing in general, for that matter) and I was wondering if it were possible to expand the SNES's Vram size via an expansion chip (kind of like the MMC5 for the NES) or something like that. If so, could you add additional bits for selecting more sprite and background character data? Sorry if this question seems ridiculous. It's just that I have not seen any documentation on the matter.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />NES and Neo Geo are the only consoles I know of that can use extra video memory in the cartridge. Super NES video memory cannot be expanded through the cartridge connector. If you're running out of space for background or sprite tiles, you can always blast in some more with DMA during vblank, replacing tiles that aren't used anymore. This philosophy (although without the DMA) was used to animate the player character as early as <em>Battletoads</em> for NES: some tiles in CHR RAM were reserved for the current animation frame for each player character, and heavily unrolled code would copy it to CHR RAM.

Because I will have multiple explosions on screen, changing the tile map would not be feasible. I seriously do not understand as to why the SNES would even have an option for 64x64 sprites, as it does not have nearly enough Vram to back it up. Oh, and out of shear desperation, can it expanded from the expansion port on the bottom of the system?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's a lot more complexity than just statically allocating a VRAM slot to each actor the way I do in <a href="https://pineight.com/gba/managing-sprite-vram.txt" class="postlink">my white paper about the technique on GBA</a>. Obviously it has to be slightly modified because you can rewrite only about a third of the sprite cels during one NTSC vblank, but averaging 20 fps across all sprites on screen still isn't half bad.
