The Teensy won't even handle 2.68MB/s bandwidth, but as long as I use one pin of the data bus for now, it should be fine for beating the controller port speeds.

If you want one sooner, I can try to etch one myself... I've been meaning to try a 2-layer board for awhile now...

Like you said, give it a little flair.<br /><br />Thank you again for putting the time into doing this, I greatly appreciate it. It's going to be a huge help for my dev efforts to have such a fast uplink.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As soon as I get my initial 3 prototype boards back to confirm that I like the placement and board outline/size, I'll send you the gerber files and you can order them <a href="http://imall.iteadstudio.com/open-pcb/small-batches-pcb/im120418013.html" class="postlink">here</a>.  For 100 boards with red soldermask, you're looking at $0.85/pcb for HASL finish (solder-coated pads) or $1.45/pcb for ENIG (gold-plated pads).  I typically prefer ENIG, but I've never done a large run of PCB's where it cost more than $10 or so to get ENIG, so it might not be worth it to you.  My parts so far have all been free samples direct from Samtec, so that's how I got them so quickly, but I'm surprised yours are taking THAT long.  I'd contact the distributor you purchased from and see if there's some issue holding up your order.  I've figured a few things out regarding cutting up the Samtec connectors that should make the process far less annoying than I'd feared, so that's nice too...

Yes, this was a hand-etched board.  The reason I want to wait on the boards I ordered is that they will actually be cut to the size I specified and placed exactly the way the final product will be.  Basically, those will show me how the boards actually fit in the case recess, whereas the handmade one is just roughly cut to the size of the part footprints.  Once I see how that all works out, then I'll call the design final and ship you the necessary files.  If you want to talk logistics and pricing, maybe we should have that discussion in PM, since that's not really relevant to the discussion of the project.

Large fixed overhead when ordering a batch of any size? Given that they're currently just going to be used for research by you and perhaps a few others, it'll be a while until you'd need the rest, and by then, you might have come up with some improvements to the board.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Speaking of improvements, the -01 sockets fit better. The -02's are fine, so don't worry about the ones you already ordered, but the -01 is a much tighter fit. I initially thought it was too narrow, which was why I went with the -02 in the first place, but definitely go with -01 in the future. Other than that, there really isn't anything to improve, as this is just a simple physical adapter, and any devices built to take advantage of it need to be on a separate board due to clearance issues that would manifest if you just tried building a board with the card edge socket directly on it.
