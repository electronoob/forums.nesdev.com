<br />An analog synthesisor could produce any kind of sound it was designed for... it's not limited to just basic waveforms.
<br />
<br />Although I doubt anyone would create a super-complex analog synth... since it's just so much simpler/easier/cheaper to go digital.
<br />
<br />I feel like I'm hijacking this thread though...  sorry   ;_;  I just wanted to speak up against using analog/digital as meaningless buzzwords.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Good music is as much a matter of taste as are good graphics, the tools can only get you so far.  Consider the sound programmer like a composer, a master of the notes but there are far more skilled players of the instrument.  The hardware is his orchestra, it only is as good as the music its playing.  Bad musicians can mangle the greatest compositions, second-rate composers can write music not worth a great musician's skill.  The orchestra may or may not sound better with higher quality instruments.  The best composers composed for what was on hand.  
<br />
<br />As an analogy, Baroque composers like Bach or Handel composed for pipe organs and harpsichords.  The piano as known by Classical composers like Schubert and Beethoven was still being developed.  Consquently, Bach and Handel's compositions generally sound better on the older instruments.  They also tailored their compositions to take maximum advantage of the musical qualities of the older instruments.  When played on a piano, generally because the older instruments are not available, they will sound different.  The organ was better suited to a particular type of style, church music, and the piano another style, concert recitals.    Musicians generally don't use one for the other.  The Baroque composers mainly composed for church and the aristocracy while the Classical composers often composed for the more bourgeois tastes of the opera house and the concert hall.

I think a piano can't replace an harpsichord, because it hasn't the exact same sound. However, I didn't have much chances to hear real baroque music on real harpsichords, because you can only hear it in concerts that will be very long and eventually become very boring, even it's interesting during the first 15 minutes, such music comes quickly boring.

<br />By the way, I always asked myself how digital samples are created. Recording a real musician playing a note is not reliable because of echo and impresition in recording, it will sound a lot noisy, and create sample 100% by hand in an analog way would need countless hours of work for poor results....

<br />Professional sound rooms minimize echoing and outside noise. Computers with moving parts are located outside the room. Digital noise reduction, which works by recording typical noise, taking its Fourier transform, and then subtracting typical power from the recorded signal's Fourier transform, cleans up any remaining noise.
<br />
<br />Or you could just get cheap, have me shout "Bingo!" into an 8-bit Sound Blaster set to record at 11025 Hz, and then upsample by 3 and convert to DPCM. (Rate $0F is within 2% of three times the 11 kHz supported by old PC sound cards.) DPCM on the NES has about a -24 dB noise floor, and you can get that even in a low-end consumer environment by using a "gate", which in practice means just cutting off the near-silence before and after the interesting part of the sample.

<br />Or through a digital signal processing algorithm that implements the same frequency response as the analog synth. A lot of the sound of acid house (TB303) is just a resonant low-pass filter with a variable cutoff, and that's easy to approximate digitally or even in real time.
<br />
<br />When I said "NES has the same capability as an analog synth" or when others say "NES has analog sound", the likely intended meaning is the reverse: that a typical analog synth can be configured to closely approximate each of the six distinct waveforms supported by the NES tone generators.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />well, i like that analogy of the harpsichord and organ and how composers composed just for those, so they sound different on piano.  this reminds me of the nsf -&gt; midi program that gigo and hi made awhile back, if you take any simplistic song and convert it to MIDI, it sounds just fine, even better in many cases-- but if you convert a song that truly uses the NES's hardware (anything by tim follin or konami?), it will sound either really weird or awful.
