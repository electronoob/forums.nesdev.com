<br />I found the above while looking for the special screw driver thingy to open up game carts (for battery swap, dev cart cannibalization, etc...).  I can't find the bbs post, but someone here recently (a month or so) ago had requested a source for the NES's 72-pin edge connector.

<br />that game bit (4.5mm) is not for open up game carts, it's used for open up snes, n64 and game cube consoles. you need a 3.8mm game bit instead:

<br />
<br />The 72-pin NES connectors are 2.5mm pitch, which is very non-standard.

<br />Anyone: Any suggestions on a good EPROM programmer.  I'd like one that works over USB or serial from Linux and Windows, but I suppose that I'll settle on windows only if I must to keep the cost down.

<br />Look at <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/Intronics-The-Pocket-Programmer-Computer-Chip-Program-_W0QQcmdZViewItemQQhashZitem3a61ea83b1QQitemZ250750862257QQptZMotorsQ5fCarQ5fTruckQ5fPartsQ5fAccessories#ht_500wt_1182" class="postlink">this on eBay</a>.
<br />
<br />We have that, different newer case I think, but it does 27C64 to 27C080 and everything inbetween. Software is free online, NEVER had a bad burn. EVER. It's the greatest one you can buy IMO. Does everything you'll ever need for NES. It's awesome.
<br />
<br />
<br />ASs for the NROM devboard, just take a NROM game and add a ZIF to it, they are a lot cheaper and need no rewiring. I understand if you don't want to do that, but it'll save money for buying chips and stuff. Just my thought. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />That was my thought.  I would start by cannibalizing a compatible game.  Heck, I could use an MMC1 if I needed to.  So long as my NROM game doesn't attempt to write to PROG-ROM (which it doesn't), the mapper should be ignored.  Or I could just "ifdef" the boot code to force the mapper to the mode that I want and then I can ignore it for the rest of the game.
<br />
<br />I've yet to figure out if a PowerPak + CF card + CF reader is cheaper than an EPROM burner, EPROM eraser, ZIF sockets and optional "repropak" board from retrousb.  The powerpak is probably cheaper and more reliable.
<br />
<br />idk.  Right now I'm arguing with Oracle over hardware support contract entitlements and questioning why I choose to get into IT instead of doing something different, like landscaping or join the Marines.  Its hard to think about hobbies when I'm stressed out over a $32,000 server that is now sitting idle because the OS utils are dumping core while parsing their own config files.
