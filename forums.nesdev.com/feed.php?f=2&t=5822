Cool idea, looks great with my notebook's LCD screen, but will probably look crappy flickering on a real TV like Batman's intro.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Dec 11, 2009 3:15 am</p><hr />

It's a neat idea.  I've tried something similar, by repeating each line X times.  Even stretching it a lot looks pretty good with fonts, but a 1/3rd scaling like this would be interesting to see with some detailed graphics.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Dec 10, 2009 2:00 pm</p><hr />

Interesting. It probably looks really good on hardware (with my monitor's refresh rate the frame blending isn't perfect).<br /><br />I don't know if many people are having enough CHR space problems to justify a complex solution like this. Complex because it doesn't look as good with refresh rates other than 60 Hz, and uses timed code specific to NTSC consoles. If it was possible to make it work in PAL or NTSC automatically it would be great.<br /><br />It is an interesting concept though, and the test screen looks very good. The frame blending created a very pleasing anti-aliasing effect (I know the font itself is anti-aliased, I'm not talking about this).<br /><br />What's up with the top half of the "l" in "Pixel"? Why's it pink? I know it's a sprite, but why did you make it that color?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Dec 09, 2009 9:28 pm</p><hr />

In the process of developing the project codenamed <strong>Camp</strong>, I have come up with several proof-of-concept demos. This one is called Tall Pixel. It demonstrates a way to stretch still images vertically by a factor of 3/2, using mixed $2006/$2005 writes and timed code, so that the CHR data for your cut scenes takes 33% less space. Tested on <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/karmic/fceu" class="postlink">FCEU Karmic</a> and on an NTSC NES + PowerPak.<br /><br /><strong>Tall Pixel (NTSC version)</strong><br /><a href="http://pics.pineight.com/nes/tall_pixel.zip" class="postlink">Download NROM binary and CC65+Python source</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Dec 09, 2009 8:42 pm</p><hr />
