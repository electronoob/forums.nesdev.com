		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello there!
<br />
<br />First time here, checked the whole techical stuff needed to rip an NSF and learning all that seems a wee bit too complex for what I need... truth be told, I just want to get 1 complete NSF to turn it to MID and then work on it for a MUGEN fullgame I'm developing (which I'ld say is 30% done already). 
<br />
<br /><strong>[We're perfectly capable of finding ROMs, thank you very much. --MOD]</strong>
<br />
<br />Street Fighter IV [p1] by Gouder, 1993. A fun pirate hack. Has got sound test, and not that many tunes are required (11 tunes total).
<br />
<br />Haven't seen this in any list of NSFs (UGETAB, gilgalad.arc-nova, etc.), so I guess this is a still non-ripped game.
<br />
<br />If complete sound effects could be ripped, even better (game has sound test but I can't access this one sound the fighters do when they perform the Dragon Punch move: F, D, Punch - done by Cliff/Goho Li and Pasta/Rober).
<br />
<br />If anyone rips this, I'll appreciate it very much and give complete credit after turning it to MID and re-working it into my MUGEN fullgame.
<br />
<br />Thanks.

<br />
<br />The official rip that I'm going to release only has the tunes and some of the voice samples. Unfortunately, there is a problem with these that I haven't been able to solve as you'll see when you listen to it. There are 12 tunes in this game. Also, I don't usually include sound effects in my rips. However, I have made a couple files so that you can cycle through the index and pick out what you want.

<br />Thanks x 10.000! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />I'll be sure to add you and this whole place in both the 'Special thanks' and 'Credits' sections. Nice people like you guys is hard to find, and friendly-to-n00bz forums are even more rare.
<br />I've already finished 10 characters and done all stages (that is sprite ripping &amp; cleaning, recoding, animation and collision box making, and gameplay tweaking). When everything's released, I'll be sure to let you all know as well. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Thanks again.
<br />
<br />
<br />PS: Sorry for the ROM post. Couldn't find any rules regarding that, so I thought it wuz OK. Actually, I couldn't find any rules post at all. :p
<br />
<br />PS2: WTF? 12th tune? WOW. Now my MUGEN fullgame can have its own tune for secret stages/bosses! *drools*

<br />They worked great! You've ripped sound fx I didn't even know the game had at all (just thought the sound test + me playing every move with every char covered everything). 
<br />Your effort'll allow me to add a great retro feel to the characters. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Thanks again!
<br />
<br />PS: Timings are great for all tunes, they are complete, etc.

<br />Wow, dude. I'm just happy. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
