I'm suggesting that Nokia should not show footage of a game running on their product without the copyright holder licensing it to them. Basically they have no permission to use Nintendo's games to promote their product. They don't have Capcom's or anyone elses I assume. And I can see a company like Nintendo looking to defend their rights and I believe it is within their rights to tell a company using images of their copyrighted game to promote their product that they can't be doing that. Really emulation itself isn't so much the problem directly. It's just the plain old use of someone else's property to promote your product.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Tue Dec 01, 2009 7:21 pm</p><hr />

Imagine an attempt to make a massively multiplayer online game for a handheld such as the Nintendo DSi or the rumored Nintendo TS. Not everybody wants to pay $75 per month ($30/mo data plan, $30/mo extra for either a mandatory voice plan for phone handsets or a tethering plan for laptop use, $15/mo for one account on one game) just to play video games.<br /><br />MottZilla: Are you suggesting Nokia can work around this by showing Mega Man instead of Mario?

How is it bullshit? I do think it's within Nintendo's rights if they are investigating the use of copyrighted Nintendo games to promote someone else's product. It doesn't seem unreasonable to me at all. Just think if Sony decided to put out their own NES, SNES, Genesis emulators for PSP and advertised them in commercials by showing the PSP playing Super Mario Bros 3, Super Mario Kart, Zelda etc.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Tue Dec 01, 2009 2:51 pm</p><hr />

I think this is the reason Nintendo is looking at legal action. I do believe it is within their rights or it should be if you are advertising your device and showing off games you can pirate with it. While I don't think they have any right to complain about the emulators existing or even advertising that they exist I do think they should remain in control of their actual games. You shouldn't be showing off for example Super Mario Kart being emulated on your phone in a commercial or other public display unless you actually licensed it from Nintendo.

Bregalad, of course a company doesn't think, but the individuals that run it have to make decisions, and regardless of how those decisions are made and who has any saying in the process, the final result is considered the company's opinion.

Well I think companies are considered like a person here too judidically (I'm not saying this is good or bad because I don't care) - but they're still not one person in reality. Well there is 1-guys companies arround (mostly farms), but definitely not Nintendo.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Dec 01, 2009 1:46 pm</p><hr />

Aargh... the copyright jihad has become such a joke as of late. It's difficult to find a way forward since modern technology has changed the circumstances drastically. Large corporations who have made huge profits off of copyright only wish to go back to the way things were 20 years ago.<br /><br />I sometimes feel we've ended up with two extreme camps - one wants to watch all movies and TV series without paying a dime and the other thinks you should be sued for whistling "Surfin' USA" without explicit permission. As usual, the way forward probably lies somewhere in between.<br /><br />Open source often works fine for software - companies can make money from support, training or customization. I'm not sure how that would work in Nintendo's case though... perhaps they should do what Blizzard did with WoW and charge customers for server access in multiplayer games?<br /><br />In this particular case I just think Nintendo's bothered by Nokia's use of pirated software when advertising their phone, not so much emulation itself.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12">Nessie</a> — Tue Dec 01, 2009 1:28 pm</p><hr />
