Re: swedish translation (quotation so others may skip):<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I thought par was easily discernable. Built from paragraf, pronunciation would be /par/. Par, as in pair, is /pɑːr/ (notice difference in both timbre and length: a vs ɑ, and a/ɑ vs a/ɑː). If that's not enough, para would work i suppose. But then we need to be sure to pronounce $xA as para-A  with a punch to the a (/'ɑː/ rather than /ɑː/). Or how a teenager might explosively say &quot;öh!&quot; when they want to have something passed at dinner  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Sida (page) might not be that much of a problem. Remember we have the prefix form sido- which would sound natural. <br /><br />So:<br />$100 = (en) sida<br />$101 ... $1FF = sidoett ... sidoeffparaeff.<br />It becomes tricker when pages are more than one, though - should it be:<br />$2FF = tvåsido effparaeff <br />or<br />tvåsidor effparaeff?<br /></div><br /><br />I suspect that we won't be able to come up with a system that'll be universally suitable for all languages. There would need to be localizations. But if the process is relatively painless for some of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers" class="postlink">the largest languages by number of native speakers</a>, it's good. Just being able to think and clearly communicate hex numerals in english is pretty good, too. <br /><br />If we *really* wanted to extend beyond $1000 using powers with dedicated names, we could extend the analogy of paragraphs, pages and blocks/books with suite, row, shelf, corridor, and floor <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> Not that anyone would use it or find it practical.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Sun Jul 02, 2017 10:22 am</p><hr />

I like book and block, and they'd work well in Swedish too (bok and block). Par may not work so well because it sounds like the Swedish word for pair/couple, meaning 2. And page would be sida? Hmmm...<br /><br />The only possible problem with block I see, is that block (of code) is a common term in programming it could conflict with.<br /><br />Yeah more than four digits and the numbers are probably too large to talk about anyway so it would be easier to divide them in two or four digits in that case. Like $FFFFFF could be read as &quot;effblockeffpageeffpareff and effpareff&quot;.

Neat indeed. Short answer at the moment but that could definitely work, especially as it has some prior use and is clear. In speech and thought &quot;paragraph&quot; needs to be cropped, though, to be practical. Par or para perhaps. I'm uncertain if page needs a similar treatment. It could be -pa, to make it fluid (pronounced pay), but would clash with the next numeral if it is A. On the other hand, language often inserts a consonant sound precisely for that reason so it could as well be pa-b, page-a, and both would be easily recognizable as the same power.<br /><br />Some examples to help discern what's best:<br /><br />$43B = fourpage thirpara-b - /fɔː(r)peɪdʒ θɜːrˈpærə beː/<br /><br />or <br /><br />= four-pa thirpar b - /fɔː(r)pei θɜːrpær beː/<br /><br />or a combo/compromise.<br /><br />1:s can still be implied:<br /><br />$10 = par<br />$20 = twenpar/twopar<br />$100 = page<br />$200 = twopage<br /><br />teens are made redundant:<br />$13 = parthree / parathree<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Sat Jul 01, 2017 3:54 am</p><hr />

I meant linguistic too, but I see that you were talking about the use of power of the base in these languages.<br />I'm not sure how this would work in Japanese though. Hekusuhyaku? Hekkyaku? It would be hard to split &quot;hyaku&quot; (100) to use as a suffix for &quot;hex-&quot;, as it is really already a single morpheme, and 1000 is even worse. Or Greek for that matter, I don't like that hex sounds like 6 rather than 16. Inventing another word without conflicts that replaces &quot;hex&quot; would solve that last problem though. And it wouldn't be hard to memorize because in your system you use it all the time. How about something like &quot;heka&quot;? It ends in a vowel so it's easy to combine with the numeral morphemes.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Generally, i believe it's better to add a syllable than subtract one to the power denominator, because many languages mostly have one-syllable words for their numerals and two-syllable words for their denominators, or a syllable with a more or less articulate difton (nine, neun, nio). So that's good for distinguishing power denominators fron numerals, but i don't know how that would sound in a two-or-more-syllable numeral system, like finnish where one is yksi and seven is seitsemän, for example.<br /></div><br />Maybe so, though the only language I know that strictly has single-syllable numerals (for single digit numbers) is Chinese. I'd be surprised if having triple-syllable numerals would be unique to Finnish anyway.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6013">Pokun</a> — Fri Jun 30, 2017 3:09 pm</p><hr />

I can't speak for other languages due to lack of experience, but many european languages share the same root for powers of [base]. <br /><br />Germanic languages:<br />Hundert, Tausand. <br />Hundred, Thousand. <br />Hundra, tusen. <br /><br />The word for hundred is another in finnish (and presumably other finnic languages):<br />Sata, Tuhat<br /><br />Sata is also shared with the slavic group, like in polish:<br />Sto, Tysiąc (c is pronounced ts)<br /><br />So, all in all, these words represent different powers without litteraly spelling out ten times ten, or ten times ten times ten, specifically. Or if they did, it's very much lost in history. <br /><br />That, unlike ten (-teen, -ty) makes them perfect for fusion with other bases than ten. That was my basis for the proposal hexdred, hexand (which can be translated to just about any of these groups at least without hassle). Hex is short for hexadecade, the suffix lets you know what power of the hexadecade. <br /><br />Rephrased: Hexdred is short form for hexadecade-dred: 16x16. -dred is assumed to mean &quot;times [base]&quot; no matter what the base is. <br /><br />Perhaps more importantly, it doesn't take more time (at least in germanic languages) to say hexdred - or shorter. Two hundred has the same speaking rythm as Two hexdred. Compare with Två hexdra. Zwei hexert. It's the same, which makes it easy and natural to use. <br /><br />Some other languages are a little worse off, rythm-wise: Hexsto (or perhaps heksto since x is not natively used in polish and represents a &quot;cha&quot; sound in other related languages, including russian), hexata.  Native speakers are free to object my attempts to synthesize new words.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />Generally, i believe it's better to add a syllable than subtract one to the power denominator, because many languages mostly have one-syllable words for their numerals and two-syllable words for their denominators, or a syllable with a more or less articulate difton (nine, neun, nio). So that's good for distinguishing power denominators fron numerals, but i don't know how that would sound in a two-or-more-syllable numeral system, like finnish where one is yksi and seven is seitsemän, for example.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Fri Jun 30, 2017 12:44 pm</p><hr />

I agree with you. I used &quot;se&quot; because it's short, easy to say, inspired by Tepple's -sy suffix and because it still has some relation to 16 which it is based on. But the others was mainly made to be similar to &quot;se&quot; in order to make a consistent pattern. We could use another vowel than &quot;e&quot; that is not A or E. I thought of &quot;o&quot; first: &quot;so&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;fo&quot; etc. And maybe change the consonants as well to avoid the tripple consonant sound in sexse. Alternatively they all use different vowel and consonant to make them more distinct from each other. Like so for 16, te for 256, fu for 4096 etc.<br /><br />I'm not sure what you mean they can be made to sound like their decimal equalents though? The decimal equalents are 16, 256, 4096 etc which only have very long compound words in decimal. I see no choice but to make up new short words for them. But yeah some kind of logical system to make them easier to remember would be nice.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6013">Pokun</a> — Fri Jun 30, 2017 11:37 am</p><hr />
