<br />That reminds me...in my emu the drums in BM sound WAAY louder than I remember them being on the console or in other emus.  What am I doing wrong?!  The noise channel sounds okay in other games...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The four highest noise pitches (0-3) have much of their energy in ultrasonic (&gt;20 kHz) frequencies. On the NES, this energy is filtered out, making the pitches sound quieter than pitch 4. But on an emu that doesn't apply a good low-pass filter to the noise channel, aliasing will cause ultrasonic energy to wrap down to audible frequencies. The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blip-buf/" class="postlink">blip-buf library</a> allows alias-free synthesis of these waveforms.

<br />Sorry neil for "dumping" your thread but back on the subject... I'd really like to see the source of nijuu too, altough I agree it's fine if it's distributed compiled so it can be easily included in project that uses another assembler than ASM6.

<br />
<br />No immediate plans but you never know. I've kind of become obsessed with the NES tracker idea at the moment though <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I'd take a look at the monstrous CPU usage before you go getting any fancy ideas about putting Nijuu into a game <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />The single-voice-echo would definitely be really superb for SFX, it uses very little CPU time (relatively). It's quite RAM-hungry though, depending on how long you'd like the delay between echoes.
<br />
<br />If you're ever in a position to do something with it, no problem in getting the code.
