		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't really see the point of randomizing it, at least not for a regular user who wants to just play games that work. For someone who needs to do debugging, though, if your debugger let you alter the input/reset states during a breakpoint, this would let you test the effect of these things at any point. Maybe if you had a virtual gamepad UI where instead of taking input from the keyboard/joypad you could toggle buttons and reset on and off by clicking them?

Not even the SEGA logo appears until this level is completed (the &quot;PRODUCED BY OR UNDER LICENSE FROM SEGA ENTERPRISES LTD&quot; probably still shows on some consoles though, since that's in the BIOS), when you can also select another character.
