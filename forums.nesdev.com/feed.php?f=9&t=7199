This thread doesn't make sense anymore.<br /><br />Will people let it go?  It seems like some kind of ego fight about who will win that useless fight.<br /><br />People have the right to their own opinion and their will always be people for or against something: that's human nature.  There is no winning argument and it will continue as just bashing on both side forever and ever.<br /><br />Argument over.

The powerpak in itself is 100% legal, the NES and CIC pattents have expired in 2005 (even if they hadn't it would be in the gray zone at worst). I'll assume powerpak is used ONLY as a development tool of course. In theory, it's what it is for...<br /><br />The same thing can't be said of fake cartridges. If there is few chances that Nintendo wants to shut anything down, then the better. Then we can freely distribute ROMs of commercial NES ROMs with no worries.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Dec 02, 2010 10:01 am</p><hr />

Historically Nintendo has only gone after current gen equipment.  Bung in the 90s was current gen.  The PowerPak is not.  There are far bigger targets in the DS flash cart market, and repro makers would be a much easier case.  With the PowerPak having no Nintendo copyrights/trademarks/patents (except debatably the Ciclone) it is not a simple thing to shut down.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4360">ibeenew2</a> — Thu Dec 02, 2010 8:02 am</p><hr />
