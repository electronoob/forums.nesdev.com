It's better than BMP even when interacting with other tools: if you need you just take libpng and problem solved, with BMP there isn't any &quot;defacto&quot; library (unless you count the Windows API), and most of the libraries you can find will always convert BMPs to true color no matter what (if you're working with pixelart you probably want to preserve the palette, especially if you're making tools for homebrew on old systems - easier to not have to redo the palette from scratch in the tool!).

I understand the feeling about selections, though. I just got used to using ctrl+D often. Both of these are more like modern painting software. Odd about modifier hotkeys not working, though. That would make everything rather annoying. Ah well. <br /><br />Edit: Just tried shift+insert/shift+delete/ctrl+insert. They do work, even if they're not in the docs. (Same way it says ctrl+r is redo, but ctrl+y also works). But yeah, none of that helps with modifier keys not working. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> If you have a little time, perhaps <a href="http://code.google.com/p/aseprite/issues/list?num=100&amp;start=100" class="postlink">start an issue</a> with your keyboard layout/OS info?

Also, layering seems kinda pointless if you can't disable/enable individual layers, or get any hints on what's in each layer. Other than that, this program is fairly usable. The animation features are decent, but converting from the program's format to a tiled image that can be converted to the NES format might need some tedious work (exporting all the frames to different files, copying them all to the same file, etc.). I'll probably try to do some actual work with it and see if it can get a permanent spot in my toolbox. Thanks for the recommendation.

You can export to spritesheet, or import the current project as a spritesheet to get each tile as a frame, and export those as individual files. You can load numbered files (tile00.png, tile01.png, etc) as an animation just by loading the first, and selecting agree to get the rest. (I use this feature to make animated gifs out of video frames.)Then you can make a sheet in any dimensions out of that, etc. etc. <br /><br />If you are dragging a selection, holding ALT will keep it aligned to your grid settings which makes rearranging tiles easy. holding shift will keep it locked to a straight vertical or horizonal axis. (The two don't work together, though.) There's quite a lot of &quot;hidden&quot; things like that, much like MS Paint.<br /><br />Ah, and to deselect, you can also right click and drag over your selection. This also allows you to erase only certain parts of the selection (whatever you right click over). This is not as good as the hotkey, though. <br /><br />&lt;/hypeman for ASEPRITE&gt;<br /><br />RE: Layers in animation editor: Yes, that's bad. That whole system is currently being reworked.<br /><br />Hopefully certain keys not working for you guys will be fixed soon. Hearing that makes me sad.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My main reason for still using the MMF2 pixel editor is that I have grown to love the &quot;right-click-to-select-color&quot; feature, and erasing is done via painting the transparent color (or on the alpha layer). For drawing a sprite, where likely the colors I am drawing with are already on my sprite image in some form, picking the color becomes very simple as I can just right click a character's hair and suddenly I am able to draw with hair color, then click the character's skin and work with that color very quickly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Graphics Gale has no notion of transparent pixels (though each layer can have a transparent color).<br /><br />Note that it's possible to have fully transparent pixels (at least with PNG) and Graphics Gale will recognize them, even in paletted images. Getting a transparent pixel isn't exactly trivial though, so when I ended up getting it by pure luck I decided I'd just copy the PNG instead of making new ones from scratch, just so that the transparent color stays. (also Graphics Gale can't cope with partially transparent pixels, so that one is going to be troublesome to work with)
