The equivalent of PATH is to have a shortcut in /usr/bin pointing to the actual program - sometimes to another shortcut and so on.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I guess those characters aren't used more than in Swedish after all (except £, $ and semicolon of course). I guess when Swedish layout was standardized they just felt that those symbols are less important and because they needed room for the three additional letters ÅÄÖ they moved {[]} to the AltGr row of the number keys (but they also moved around a bunch of other keys for some reason).<br />American keyboards doesn't seem to use AltGr at all, it's just a secondary Alt key. UK keyboards looks like they have the same key layout as Swedish keyboards. Just the labels on the keys are different.<br /><br />I'm already using Japanese keyboard layout in Windows a lot (since it's the most practical way to type Japanese) and in alphanumeric input mode, Japanese keyboard layout is pretty much the same as the English ones and I pretty much memorized the keys for that. So why don't I just use that? Because switching keyboard layout back and forth isn't really less troublesome than using AltGr.<br />Also getting a foreign keyboard would just introduce more problems than it would solve.

Apparently it's used in economy as a currency sign as a replacement when a certain currency sign isn't available. I don't think I've ever seen it being used though. I kind of wished it was possible to make a dollar sign appear instead of it when programming.<br />According to Swedish Wikipedia it seems it was used instead of the dollar sign in BASIC of the Swedish computer ABC 80.

I didn't have access to one such computer, though. Did you know Ericsson made computers and even laptops?

A phonemic transcription uses one symbol for each phoneme; a phonetic transcription specifies which particular sound is used in each case.
