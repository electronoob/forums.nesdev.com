<br />
<br />I have no real stance on the matter; I'm leaving the decisions here up to the other moderators, including Memblers, and the general community.  If everyone signs off on it, then we'll lock the board down and I'll be happy to provide a tarball of the site + mysqldump of the existing DB.  I will redirect URLs / point DNS A records wherever they need to go per folks' requests.  Rest assured you'll get no push-back from me.  :-)
<br />
<br />Three things to keep in mind if you do end up hosting this:
<br />
<br />1. File/directory permissions.  We use the <a href="http://mpm-itk.sesse.net/" class="postlink">Apache 2 ITK MPM</a>, where httpd changes its uid/gid before doing any kind of exec or file I/O.  Thus stupid things like "chmod {666,777}" are a thing of the past.  There's really no other way to run a multi-user-safe Apache instance.  suexec/cgiwrap don't cut it.  So just keep in mind that some manual chmods may be required.
<br />
<br />2. The forum software is, as I understand it, a bit modified to work with UTF-8.  Quietust, if I remember right, did a lot of this work.  So if someone considers upgrading the board, well, keep that in mind.
<br />
<br />3. Configuration files for the board, etc. need to be changed to refer to a completely new base URL for cookies + server-side-sessions.  Please don't keep them referring to nesdev.com.  I forget where this is within the config file, but worth pointing out / reminding folks of anyway.

I've not posted here a ton, but this place has been one of my daily reads for quite some time now, and even having no NES programming experience I know more about the system now than I did before I ever visited the site/forums. I also want to thank the forum staff for helping keep this place clean. I know that the days of NesDev aren't over, but I like to think of it as the ending of one era and the beginning of another.
<br />
<br />Here's to years and years of future NesDev goodness.
<br />
<br />Good luck in your future endeavors, koitsu!

<br />
<br />I think the forum and the wiki is going to be more difficult to to find a place and move it. If no consensus can be made about it. I do suggest to at least move the main site to another server. I assume that the forum and wiki consumes the most bandwidth. 
<br />
<br />Also remove some of the backup downloads as well as writing some htaccess scripts to block hotlinking (if there isn't already one in place here). That should cut the bandwidth consumption down some. That's what I have done with my own website.
<br />
<br />Anything to be done to cut bandwidth usage at a new place since I doubt that many places would offer as much bandwidth.
<br />
<br />Just a suggestion! But consider it.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />To koitsu:
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope that you consider staying with the community whatever may happen in the future. It seems like to me that you have contributed so much to NESdev, not to mention the translation hacking community, providing ad-free webspace to many people for a very long time. As well as your other contributions over the years. It's beyond price and very much appreciated!
<br />
<br />I can say that I will remember everything that you've done for the community. Thank you!
