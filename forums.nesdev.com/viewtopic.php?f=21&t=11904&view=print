For starters, here's the faces that appear in the password screen:<br /><br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/faces.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Up at the top are the SNES images, below are the NES, and in the middle are my own NES renderings. Easy stuff. But now the tricky part, the sprites:<br /><br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/aladdinstand.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/snesaladdinstand.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/aladdinstandhack.png" alt="Image" /><br />Reason being, the tiles don't seem to be organized in any way that makes any sense. Regardless, I'm going to continue working on this. If anyone is willing to lend a hand, I'd appreciate it.<br /><br />Here's the ips file of my progress so far (be sure to patch this to the version that says '1995 Copyright' not '1996':<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/Aladdin016.ips">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/820 ... din016.ips</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Change list:<br />-edited faces on password screen<br />-replaced text: '1995 COPYRIGHT' to: '1993 CAPCOM' (probably should read '1995 HUMMER TEAM')<br />-replaced standing/jumping sprite<br />-faster 'glide' movement

Soon I realized that although impressive, these ports were very sloppy, but my fondness for good looking demakes remains.

So I'm happy someone is doing it - and even happier to see it's being done right.<br /><br />A question: I don't know how many different versions of this pirate Aladdin game exists but is your gfx mod compatible with the music hack (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2107/">http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2107/</a><!-- m -->)?<br />It would be perfect to apply both modifications to a single Rom.

We can split the work.<br /><br />As for the music hack, if I'm not mistaken, neither of the roms listed on that page are the '1995' version, which is what I'm working with. I don't know why Gigasoft chose the '1996' version, which has the music glitch. But I patched his hack on my hack and, aside from freezing once, it seems to work alright.<br /><br />If the graphics hack can be patched to either version, then there shouldn't be a problem. I might make two versions of this patch, we'll see.

Aladdin doesn't run at full speed immediately, meaning you'd have to make a 'running jump' on many short platforms, which can either make you fall off said platform, or jump when you're moving slowly, missing the platform entirely.  Attacking and jumping seem to have been reversed, too.

Perhaps you could make it so that he always moves at 'full speed', because it makes a lot of jumps annoying, and I'm certain Aladdin moved at a constant speed in the SNES game.
