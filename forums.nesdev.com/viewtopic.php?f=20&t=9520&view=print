The toll free# on the 30min activation card has been disconnected, and Madcatz has been of little assistance. (Apparently Madcatz only purchased the website and software rights to Gameshark, and not the &quot;technology&quot; portion.)<br /><br />Without the MX cart first being &quot;activated&quot; with a factory issued REG CODE (via toll free#), the cart will not function at all, rendering it completely useless. I find it odd that Interact would have locked up the entire cart in this manner, as the PDA functions are not in any way linked to the email functions (ie, address book not linked to email composer).<br /><br />If you're a collector of odds/ends GB carts, it would be a unique buy. It is a cool gizmo. Don't plan on any serious usage of the device though. Good luck with your purchase. 7/2003&quot;

Of course they were right.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> I could get one for nostalgia's sake... but if it's totally locked even for offline stuff, and I have to go through trouble to get around this I may have to pass. Even for six dollars.

I thought that was impossible because the GB wouldn't boot without the correct logo in the ROM header.  That's definitely something I'll have to look into when I get mine.

I do remember reading that the Super GB checks the header checksum and possibly the logo on the SNES side rather than the GB side.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi there!<br /><br />So it turns out, the MX card although old, and arguably useless, IS reprogrammable and DOES contain a primitive uart (serial port) <br /><br />So if you've been after that cheap ($10) flash cart (256kbyte) with a serial port for MIDI?? grab yourself one from Ebay NOW! <br /><br />It seems the only people still interested in flash carts are those wanting to turn the gameboy into a synth, and they seem to want a midi interface. It has no SRAM but it is a flash cart! so you can write to the flash in operation. No battery issues. Anyway, Take a look at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bennvenn.com/mx.html">http://www.bennvenn.com/mx.html</a><!-- m --> if you're interested in how it works. <br /><br />Ben

I guess it's easier to just depower it rather than bothering to write <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">ATSxx=yy</tt> to the serial port.<br /><br />Any idea why Cart D7 is disconnected from Flash D7? (Flash programming?) Are Flash D0..D6 directly connected to Cart D0..D6?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Cart D7 is connected to Flash D7. I must have made a typo writing that up. All 8 data lines go into the MBC. Thinking about it, it must have internal ROM too, as it feeds the gameboy a correct logo during its bootrom checksum then switches out the custom logo. I wonder what triggers the logo swapping. maybe a certain number of clock cycles on the clk pin?? Unless the real logo is located in the flash elsewhere and it just bankswitches automatically?
