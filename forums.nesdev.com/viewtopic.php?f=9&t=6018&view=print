<br />It doesn't work on Nintendo boards, but I can see how it could be modified to work on a modified MMC3 clone that uses a divide-by-42 counter on A12.

<br />Does anyone know if any commercial MMC3 games break the scanline counter's rules on purpose (i.e. make the scanline counter function differently than intended on purpose)? If there isn't any, it would be really cool if someone could make an MMC3 clone without those limitations, which would be more flexible than the original mapper but still be compatible with games made for it.

<br />
<br />It sounds to me like they are modifying official MMC3 boards to do IRQs differently than normal. You still need an official MMC3 board as the only place you'd find a cloned MMC3 is from China, and even then you need a MMC3 without the scanline counter defect.
<br />
<br />If someone did come up with a MMC3 mod that fixed it, perhaps that Gradius 2 MMC3 hack would work better as the MMC3 scanline counter wouldn't be such a problem.

If someone would like I would be willing to dump the cart to check for software differences and then take it apart and check for additional hardware, if its a PIC or something in there I could attempt to unlock (assuming it is locked) and dump it but there is a good chance I would fail at that.
<br />
<br />So what would some possible hardware mods that would work be? Could it be as simple as adding a cap or something?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Even an MMC3 clone with the scanline counter defect would work with its /IRQ line disconnected if the IRQ logic would fit in a separate CPLD with access to the same signals. This could involve dividing PPU A13 by 42, dividing M2 by 113.667 like Konami boards do, or other approaches that you'll probably think of and describe below. A Schmitt trigger or something to smooth the A12 line going into the MMC3 wouldn't work because it needs accurate A12 to find which bank number to output.

<br />He also said that you have to add a new ram chip thats a faster speed.
<br />I asked him for the part number.

<br />but other wise it is normal tsrom wiring.

<br />He didn't say any thing about modding the mmc3.
