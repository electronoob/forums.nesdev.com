<br />So, I have been wondering for awhile about this kind of thing. I see people talking like "my routine takes X amount of scanlines," or "if you do X routine for X amount of scanlines," etc.
<br />
<br />How exactly do you guys figure the amount of scanlines? Do you count as you step through a debugger? Do you count how many cycles the code takes, or even just guesstimate it? I'm just not sure how it gets figured up.
<br />
<br />Thanks for any answers fellas (and/or ladies, should you be around).

<br />As never-obsolete pointed out, some debuggers can display the elapsed CPU cycles. I seem to remember that Nintendulator's debugger even gives (x, y) coordinates of the raster position. So put a breakpoint at the beginning and end of the subroutine, run it, subtract, and convert to your preferred unit.
<br />
<br />Other techniques work even on the NES hardware, which lacks a cycle-counting debugger:
<br /><ul><li>Celius' technique: Put a "ruler" (repeating pattern) on screen, start the code at a particular scanline, trigger a raster effect, and eyeball how many scanlines have elapsed (I've done this on the GBA) </li><li>Load the code into a mapper with a readable scanline counter or CPU cycle timer, start the code at a particular scanline, run it, and read the counter when it's done (I've done this on the GBA too) </li><li>Run the code in a loop and see how many iterations finish between NMIs (that's called a benchmark, and it's common even on PCs) </li></ul>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />One trick I have done is use the grayscale bit.  Turn grayscale on, run code, turn grayscale off.  Usually I am not looking for exactly how many scanlines so I don't have a ruler pattern.  Just care about how long into the frame my game engine takes so I want to see a gap of non gray at the bottom of the screen.  Biggest benefit is it only takes a couple lines of code.

<br />Somewhere on my computer I have a custom version of VirtuaNES that has some extra registers for benchmarking code (I believe it could show the maximum # of cycles taken too, for different iterations).  I could find and upload that if it'd be useful to anyone.

<br /><a href="http://membler-industries.com/memblers/NES/VirtuaNESprof.zip" class="postlink">Here it is</a>.  I can't easily find the email with the instructions on how to use it (Norix sent it to me at my request), but going from memory I believe the registers were just above $4017 and there were 2 of them.  Try $4018 and $4019.
