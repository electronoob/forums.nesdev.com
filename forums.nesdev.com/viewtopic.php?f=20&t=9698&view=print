It's probably doomed to fail either because of lack of ideas to fill up 52 weeks, or because I'll lose motivation. But I'll keep going for as long as I can.<br /><br />Last week I explored making the DMG LCD display more than four shades of green by switching quickly between shades, and abusing the slow nature of the DMG LCD.<br /><br />Link: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.gg8.se/wordpress/2013/01/06/gameboy-project-week-1-more-than-four-shades-of-green/">http://blog.gg8.se/wordpress/2013/01/06 ... -of-green/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />This week I released a mystery ROM which (arguably) does something, but what?

What I mean is, if you know beforehand that there's a low chance of completing the challenge, you're setting yourself up for a disappointment (or just don't care enough, at which point there's really no point in calling it a challenge in the first place).<br /><br />But good luck regardless, I hope some cool stuff comes out of it!

Part of the problem is code vanity, (the idea that other people may find my code ugly) and also the implication that people will start asking me questions in private when they can't understand some aspect of the code or can't compile it or so. I will definitely consider sharing code when it has educational value, though.<br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Looks cool !

There's EMS 64M that someone mentioned above. There's also bleepbloop/smartboy USB cartridges, which are not made any more, but sometimes available on the second hand market. There's also drag'n'derp which is a brand new cartridge which is super hard to get because it's only made in low quantities. (Batches of a few tens of cartridges are let out at a time, and are sold out within minutes.)<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://derpcart.com/">http://derpcart.com/</a><!-- m --><br />And finally, there's a flash cartridge project which I can't say too much about at the moment, but which will probably turn out to be beneficial for the Gameboy community. I'm not involved in that project, but I have a project of a similar nature in store for this year.<br /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">nitro2k01 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It's probably doomed to fail either because of lack of ideas to fill up 52 weeks, or because I'll lose motivation.

The projects don't have to be big, though, just something each week. In case of failure, the plan is to step down to one project every second, third or fourth week instead, rather than giving up. I have quite a few ides, and as it turns out, other people too. No matter what, <em>something</em> good will come out of it.
