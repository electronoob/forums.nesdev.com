Yeah, lists of symbols to pick from should make things much better. Whenever necessary you could bring up the lists of commands, variables, constants, and so on. And numbers shouldn't be that annoying, seeing as there are only 10 different symbols.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat May 22, 2010 1:22 pm</p><hr />

You're probably going to notice stuff like I have during long-term projects, by the time the game is ready to be built, 32kB EPROMs could be more expensive than much larger ones.  Not long ago I had even seen 2Mbyte EPROMs going for just a couple bucks.<br /><br />If you can get by with CNROM, that's cool though.  Loading data from CHR-ROM isn't uncommon, but I wouldn't do it if it ever looks like it could be a limitation (consider what amount re-usability of your code you might want for bigger projects later, for example).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue May 04, 2010 3:31 pm</p><hr />

This is getting out-topic, but yes I'll be able to load data from CHR-ROM. I'll have to first draw all graphics I want to use in the game so I see what's free tough.<br />An issue is that sprite definition easily takes up a whole lot of ROM space for little things.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon May 03, 2010 11:37 pm</p><hr />

Recently I came to the conclusion that there is really no reason to use CNROM rather than UNROM. It's not like CNROM allows for sophisticated CHR bankswitching tricks, due to the huge size of the banks. Because of this, UNROM is more versatile because it allows you to distribute the available space between CHR and PRG freely, and you can also do CHR-RAM tricks if you want to.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon May 03, 2010 2:27 pm</p><hr />
