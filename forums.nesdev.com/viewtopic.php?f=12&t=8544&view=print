		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello,
<br />
<br />First I would like to say sorry, if I'm posting at the wrong forum.
<br />I'm new here so, Hello! 
<br />
<br />I recently bought a SNES (PAL) and started buying games on ebay. Both PAL and NTSC games.
<br />Then the information kept coming into my head.
<br />Apparently I couldn't play NTSC games on a PAL console using Only a Converter.
<br />I looked up on hard-mods, but no matter what it seemed like I gimped myself, either I got to play most games or not NTSC at all, etc.
<br />
<br />So I ended up with this; I'm gonna search the whole world for PAL games before buying NTSC games. But there are some games that only came out in the US.
<br />To make this short, I was wondering, Do any of you have a list over PPU games? aka, games that dosnt work with any converter.
<br />
<br />Thanks a lot for all help.

There are some games that will never work with a converter but these probably are fairly few. Mainly games that have extra hardware in them like Super Mario RPG, maybe also the Super FX due to timing issues. I'm not sure if I list of what you want exists.

<br />
<br />Well today I got all the three Donkey Kong games on NTSC. 
<br />Using the Super Game converter , I get the PPU error ; 
<br />"THIS GAME PAK IS NOT DESIGNED FOR YOUR SUPER FAMICOM OR SUPER NES."
<br />
<br />So I'm really scared of my coming copy of Secret of Mana, ff3 and zelda etc. 
<br />
<br />I found a list with the games that has that chip implemented, like Super mario world 2, Kirby super star, Super mario RPG, and some other "minor" (In my eyes) titles.
<br />
<br />But, I'm kinda confused. How is the game genie \ action replay \ cheat codes, compared to my "Super game converter" 
<br />

<br />Thats the thingy I got.
<br />
<br />And what is your suggestion on what I should do?
<br />
<br />Thanks again.

<br />
<br />Hard mods are mostly for people who know what they're doing and have technical expertize. 
<br />
<br />You will save yourself a lot of confusion and frustration, as an NTSC system will play all NTSC games without any kind of issue (SFC and SNES games as both use the same main board, just the casing of the console and cartridges are different)

<br />Best mod, as far as I understand, is to install the SuperCIC in your SNES. (Why is nobody selling them?!)

<br />This is good advice. These consoles are pretty cheap nowadays, often costing less than some high profile games. Today's TVs will take practically anything you throw at them, so this really does sound like your best shot.

<br />So a Game genie etc, as mentioned earlier, won't help at all?

<br />
<br />If you are correct, you just made me one happy man! ;D 
<br />
<br />Got those 3 games coming in next week (Hopefully - yet doubtful).
<br />But as long as SoM, FF3 and Chrono Trigger can be tricked using the "Super Game Converter" this won't be a problem. Since the rest of the games I'm able to find as PAL.
<br />
<br />Anyway, Just ordered the Donkey Kong games as PAL, so I don't need to dig more into Game Genie for the moment. 
<br />
<br />Thanks

<br />
<br />Oh in fact I think my adapter highack one of the PPU registers so that the games belive the console is NTSC, it's fun because I always leave the adapter in the console (even when playing PAL games) and a few of my PAL games (at least DKC) refuses to run because they "think" this is a NTSC console.
