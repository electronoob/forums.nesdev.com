<br />If permanently eating 700MB speed things up, then yes I'm with you.
<br />
<br />PS : The 64-bit OS eats 1GB of RAM, but now I've installed the 32-bit version instead, which is better because my computer have less than 4GB of RAM which can be adressed with 32-bits, so it is more optimal that way, and "only" have 700MB of resident RAM (as opposed to 2k which had 100MB this is a change).

<br />
<br />There's two reasons this mentality is silly for most things
<br />
<br />1) The OS allocating contiguous amounts of memory is not a "painful" process -- meaning the whole procedure is actually quite fast.  The same goes for freeing memory back to the OS.  The concept "use only what you need" applies here.  It only becomes a slow procedure as memory becomes more and more segmented (that is to say, a varied amount of allocations of various sizes are scattered all over, rather than being linear).
<br />
<br />2) The OS has no intrinsic knowledge of how much memory an application is going to require down the road/over time.  I suppose it could keep an average of this somehow, but would you not agree keeping track of that would probably waste more system resources in general.
<br />
<br />#2 is solvable -- that is to say, there *are* applications out there which do preallocate large amounts of memory.  The amount allocated is almost always user-adjustable, but the default is often based off of how much free memory is available at the time (e.g. free/4, or some other similar formula).
<br />
<br />Depending on what the overall application requires, sacrificing memory for speed can in fact be worth it.  When is it worth it?  That's for the programmer to decide.  There's a multitude of situations where it's justified, but even more where it's not.
<br />
<br />Two "real world" applications that I know which behave this way are: Adobe Photoshop and Sun Java (both the JRE, and the JVM as a whole).  Photoshop's well-justified, while (IMHO) Java generally isn't.
<br />
<br />There's another real world scenario where preallocation is easily worth it: low-latency scenarios.  I happen to <a href="http://www.tellme.com/" class="postlink">work at such a place</a> -- we basically "bridge the gap" between the telephone and computers.  Fast voice recognition + parsing what the user said + giving them immediate feedback is of the utmost importance -- e.g. 0.3 seconds is considered a very long time.  So for this type of scenario, preallocation is absolutely mandatory.  Machines with 4-16GB of RAM are incredibly common, and daemons preallocate on startup for a very good reason (think: grammar syntax, audio content, parsers, and general voice analysis (audio is big!)).
<br />
<br />In general I'm a minimalist myself, within reason.  So I'm very much against the concept of a "macrocosmic OS" (e.g. Super Size Everything, no concept of free memory, etc.).  If you know you're going to need 60MB of memory, fine, allocate it.  If you don't know how much you're going to need, but it's significantly smaller, allocate it dynamically and free it when done.
<br />
<br />This whole thing becomes even more complex when you consider threaded environments, where termination of a thread releases all memory the thread had allocated back to the OS.  Given that SMP (think: multi-core) is common today, overall higher amounts of memory usage is acceptable.  By that I mean, the OS "chewing up" 700MB of RAM when you have 4GB really isn't that bad... unless, of course, you REALLY COULD use that extra memory for something (see above, re: Photoshop).
<br />
<br />That remind me -- there is one utility from SysInternals (now Microsoft) for Windows which is absolutely awesome.  It's called <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/dd535533.aspx" class="postlink">VMMap</a>.  Check it out -- but it's important you understand what it is you're looking at!  I run into this situation all the time in the UNIX world.  "When I run top, why is this one process eating up 800MB of RAM?"  "Actually, the 800MB is under SIZE, not RSS/RES, which means 800MB is being used and shared across multiple applications/programs (text/data/stack segments).  800MB of RSS/RES (resident) would indicate a much bigger problem, and likely indicates a memory leak."  "Ohh... nevermind then."
<br />
<br />Windows does things similarly in concept, but the implementation/style of their VM is *very* different.

<br />Oh ok I gotcha. It's a mater of preference I guess. The start menu was one of the few things I liked about vista, and now 7. I like the fact that it scrolls your list of programs up and down rather than filling your screen with them. I find it compact and more efficient.

<br />Also someone said that Windows XP runs ok on 128MB of RAM. Since when? It runs like crap on 256 and not too much better on 512. It runs OK on 768MB, but still kinda slow. 
<br />Matter of a fact now days when I encounter a computer that needs a RAM upgrade I don't sell anything smaller than a 1GB module. There's no point anymore. Windows hasn't run well on less than 1GB since Windows 98. Maybe before Service Pack 2 Windows XP could squeak by on 256mb but it's been a long time. Pentium 3's were the norm when it first came out so you rarely found a PC with more than 512 MB. Windows XP has grown with the hardware with each service pack and now runs like crap on less than 1GB.

<br />A few years back I found an old K6 that used to run Windows 98. I managed to upgrade it's RAM to 128MB and it worked very well with XP. I used it as an extra PC at my girlfriend's house, and it was enough for browsing the web with Firefox, editing all kinds of documents and running old games and emulating classic systems. That PC is retired again, as I bought a notebook and my in-laws got a new PC, but it was just fine last time I used it.
<br />
<br />Plus I've been using XP under a virtual machine with 384MB of RAM and I have no complaints. My real PC has 2GB and my notebook just 1GB.

<br />
<br />Oh I don't even bother with those. Especially since a brand new Dell is $269. The cost of PC133 + Labor to install isn't worth the value of the computer. I don't even think I can find a local source to sell me PC133.

The start menu was one of the few things I liked about vista, and now 7. I like the fact that it scrolls your list of programs up and down rather than filling your screen with them. I find it compact and more efficient. </div>
<br />
<br />Compact, yes, I agree. But since I was always ordering all my shortcuts (and still doing it in win7), it never covered completely my screen like some horror I saw in some customers computer while doing tech support.
<br />
<br />One of my issue is the fact it's so slllooowww to react. If there is a way to make it snappy, I guess I would like it more. For winxp, if you use tweakui, you can even tweak the time the menu react to make it faster.  Maybe I should check if there is something for that menu. I would like to mouse over the folder and it open fast.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For now, Windows 7 reacts very quickly to everything, as Microsoft adwised it to. With the auto windows update I was able to get some drivers, so I'm almost definitely stucking to Windows 7. Even if it's ture it's ridiculous it uses 800 MB or RAM when Windows 2k I've used for the last 7 years uses only 80 MB, but hey that's called technology improvement. Honnestly, as much as I like retro stuff and all, I think it would really suck if computer didn't evolve, and I'm glad we get new very powerful technologies. Not counting it matains many great jobs for companies such as Intel, AMD, ATI, Microsoft, ..... Honestly it should be cool to work in order to create technology that is always surpassing the current trend in order to get more and more powerfull computers.
<br />
<br />For tokumary, how slow an OS is when it comes to booting, shutting down and launching programms mostly due to it's hard drive's slowness, and have few to do with CPU power and RAM amount. CPU power and RAM amount is significant if your games lag or something like that.
<br />
<br />It your OS makes about a minue to boot, it's because it have to load megabyte of stuff from the slow hard drive to the fast RAM before using it. So if you have some spare $400 you could get a SSD for your computer and theorically it will be very fast, launch programms in a matter of miliseconds, and as a plus consumes less power. IMHO, in a couple of years, SSDs will be much less expensive, regular hard drives will be considered old pieces of obsolete crap and all new computers will be equiped with SSDs, which will be a great thing.

<br />
<br />This is just really great.

<br />My PC can do all of that and it's like, 4 years old. PS2 emulation sucks though.
