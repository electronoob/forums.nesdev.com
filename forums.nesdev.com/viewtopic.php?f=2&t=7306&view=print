		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Has anyone ever tried/throught to do a NES game completely based on text ?
<br />OK this might not sounds too exciting at first, but there is several advantages : It might be easier to design entierely on paper, and you don't have to spend time doing graphics.
<br />
<br />I'm pretty sure such games were common in the early 80's, but I think none was made for the NES, because back then it would have been crazy not to use it's graphical possibilities. Today it's different since both text adventures and NES games are retro anyways.
<br />
<br />It could also be a way to test the CC65 compiler for the NES, as it would probably work very well written in C since this game would just perform logic and print text/menus on the screen, and possibly play music.
<br />
<br />I guess the closer it got was Portopia, an menu-based investigation game, that recently got an english translation. It has static graphics, and I really liked the game.

There were plenty of graphics in those of course, but between the 'look' feature and all the text in those games, it almost could have worked as a text adventure.  (with just a list of objects to interact with, instead of graphics)
<br />
<br />Actually at one point I did start writing a text adventure.  It was really funny looking, I made the font as 11 (I forget) segment LED characters.  The 'spaces' in the text were the same things, with 'unlit' LEDs, heh.  This display part was working, but I didn't write nearly enough text to make it interesting.  I almost forgot about that project.  I think maybe I started it for the Minigame compo, but I'm not sure.

<br />
<br />But as for a game in the style of Infocom's text adventures, a pure text game wouldn't work because the 72-pin NES has no keyboard, as Shiru pointed out. You could have it use the Family Basic keyboard, but then you'd have to make the text in Japanese for the players to understand it. It took a tweak of the format to make it work on the NES; Memblers mentioned the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacVenture" class="postlink">MacVenture</a> games developed by ICOM and Kemco. And does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Tomato_in_the_Salad_Kingdom" class="postlink">Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom</a> count?
<br />
<br />If you're looking for a genre to make in C for the NES, look no further than Koei's war sims. NovaYoshi has uncovered evidence in the games' strings that they use the C standard library.
<br />
<br />And cc65 isn't the only C compiler; there's also <a href="http://www.kdef.com/geek/vic/quetz.html" class="postlink">Quetzalcoatl</a>, which unlike cc65 is actually free software and suitable for use in commercial projects. There's <a href="http://osdk.defence-force.org/" class="postlink">OSDK</a>, a compiler based on LCC, but based on the description on the web site, it appears to be hardcoded for the Oric computers and difficult to adapt to other 6502 machines.

<br />So in other words, Battle Kid might be doable in C, possibly at a slower Micronics-style frame rate with some asm subroutines to load screens.

<br />I guess you are right... then you'd better program an adventure game with graphics, like Shadowgate etc...
<br />
<br />However, I think even if this is "hidden" games with text parser just have a limited set of commands, just that they're available only though the parser.
<br />
<br />A problem with parsers (aside of the lack of keyboard) is the trouble that comes when they should be translated into different languages.

<br />Well...while DRD is waiting for grafics,at least...I started to think that I still have a lot of space in PRG,so why don't make "a_e Adventure3"?
<br />Hmm..A_e adventure is alittle series of text adventures made by me.
<br />First one is for C64,second one is for NDS(It's demo only for now,Maybe I'll port it to DOS,as I was asked for it)
<br />Sorry,but it's pointless to post link here-game is in Polish Language only.
<br />The games like ine this "Choose Your Own Adventure" thing(never even heard about it)give player a few options to choose,and dependly on answer it gives you result(like,for example,using a tank to broke wall).
<br />About bunnyboy's engine-It looks a little unfriendly to play,I mean...There's a little to many text at top,but It's just me,I hope.

I don't know a lot about it - if someone is interested enough to take a look, <a href="http://www.gnelson.demon.co.uk/zspec/" class="postlink">here's the specification.</a>  I imagine space would be a big issue, due to the sheer number of strings and opcodes, running a virtual machine on top of NES assembly.
<br />
<br />Still, Zork 1 came out in 1980, and didn't exactly push the envelope even then.  I know I've run a z-code interpreter on my TI-89, but that's got a lot more memory than the NES too.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">To give some idea of the sizes found in typical story files, here are a few statistics, mostly gathered by Paul David Doherty, whose "Infocom fact sheet" file is the definitive reference.<br /><br /><br />(i) Length<br /><br />The shortest files are those dating from the time of the 'Zork' trilogy, at about 85K; middle-period Version 3 games are typically 105K, and only the latest use the full memory map. In Versions 4 and 5, only 'Trinity', 'A Mind Forever Voyaging' and 'Beyond Zork' use the full 256K. 'Border Zone' and 'Sherlock', for instance, are about 180K. (The author's short story 'Balances' is about 50K, an edition of 'Adventure' takes 80K, and 'Curses' takes 256K (it's padded out to the maximum size with background information; the actual game comprises only about 245K). Under Inform, the library occupies about 35K regardless of the size of game.)<br /><br /><br />(ii) Code size<br /><br />'Zork I' uses only about 5500 opcodes, but the number rises steeply with later games; 'Hollywood Hijinx' has 10355 and, e.g. 'Moonmist' has 15900 (both these being Version 3). Against this, 'A Mind Forever Voyaging' has only 18700, and only 'Trinity' and 'Beyond Zork' reach 32000 or so. (Inform games are more efficiently compiled and make better use of common code -- the library -- so perform much better here: the old Version 3, release 10 of 'Curses' (128K long, and a larger game than any Infocom Version 3 game) has only 6720 opcodes.) </div>

The "small game" example shows over a little over 2kB in dynamic memory.  By adding a WRAM to the cart, it theoretically should fit that example.
