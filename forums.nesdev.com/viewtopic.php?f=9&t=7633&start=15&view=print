		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It is claimed that the scanline counter goes twice as fast when using the MMC3 with the pattern tables backward. I have a hypothesis about what causes this.
<br />
<br />The fetches for the first two tiles are at x=320-327 and 328-335. Then the PPU waits 5 cycles[1] before starting the next tiles at x=0-7, 8-15, ... The MMC3 sees A12 go high at 324, low at 328, high at 332, low at 336, and then not high again until 345 (x=4 of the next line). It's low for nine dots, which are three whole M2 cycles (on NTSC), compared to 1.333 cycles for the rises between fetches.
<br />
<br />So it counts at x=324, then it counts again at x=4.
<br />
<br />I have a way to test this hypothesis: put both sprites and background at $1000. If my hypothesis is correct, the scanline counter should run at normal speed, clocking only at x=4.
<br />
<br />Once this is tested, I can think of ways to generate several different patterns of A12 on a line using 8x16 sprites. The way I understand <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_sprite_evaluation" class="postlink">sprite evaluation</a>, where secondary OAM is cleared to $FF, the PPU will fetch the tiles for a sprite whose tile number is $FF ($0FF0-$0FFF, $1FF0-$1FFF, or $1FE0-$1FFF depending on PPUCTRL settings).

<br />Was this mentioned on the board somewhere? I was going off of Kevtris's MMC3 doc on his website, since that's the only place the double-clock quirk was mentioned, and it was mentioned for BG and Sprites both using page 1. If this was incorrect, and the double-clock is actually when BG uses page 1, and sprites use page 0, then that makes a lot more sense, meaning I was probably scratching my head over nothing. :S
<br />
<br />Either way, I agree with your hypothesis. I'm just frusterated that I focused so much on figuring out why an extra clock would occur between BG and Sprite fetches to realize that there were 5 PPU cycles at the end of each scanline (except the prefetch every other frame) where A12 is invariably low. &gt;_&lt;

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, I just got some updated information from a certian Mr. Disch.
<br />
<br />So, I made this thread originally because I was confused over a possible quirk with the MMC3 where the scanline counter clocks twice if both BG and sprites use tiles in the 1xxx range. I read this on Kevtris's site, because it's the only place I knew it was mentioned.
<br />
<br />However, this was disproved by Blargg some time ago, and nobody cared to point this out, so this entire thread was a complete waste of time for all involved.
<br />
<br />The scanline counter only ever clocks once in a scanline, and that's ONLY when either sprites use page 1 with bg on page 0, or the other way around. It does watch A12, and it does ignore rapid toggling of A12, so some kind of filtering is going on. The A12 rises have to be far enough apart to be recognized, and although we don't know <em>how</em> far, it's estimated to be something like 14-16 pixels apart.
<br />
<br />So unfortunately Tepples, this would debunk your hypothesis, because A12 is only low for the last 5 pixels of the scanline, which isn't long enough for the MMC3 to stop ignoring A12 toggles. In fact, Armadillo uses this backwards configuration, so this must be true, and must prove that the scanline counter counts the scanlines correctly.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I'll stop now because this information is <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/docs/362/" class="postlink">plainly available in Disch's mapper docs</a>, and in the future, I'm going to recommend we update the information on the wiki using these docs.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In that case, it'd still warrant a test case to see exactly how far apart the clocks must be to trigger a reclock. I think I know how to generate the 8x16-mode OAM patterns need to trigger rises spaced at 8, 16, 24, or 32 dots apart. Then we could nail it down to "somewhere between 8 and 16" or "somewhere between 16 and 24", and anyone with a devcart could verify it.
<br />
<br />It might be using M2 to make sure at least four CPU cycles have elapsed between rises. <strong>It might even vary on PAL vs. NTSC</strong> due to different dot:M2 ratios (3:1 on NTSC, 3.2:1 on PAL).
<br />
<br />Yes, I have been transcribing Disch's docs occasionally.

<br />If somebody comes up with a test suite that runs in RAM, and nobody else volunteers <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />, I can test this on my NES by hotswapping (PAL only, though).

<br />Yeah, I forgot about that, altho audio/background color etc could be used for signaling success/fail as well. The cart is SMB3, so CHR ROM. It should also be possible to read the results from RAM over the controller port cable, but I'll have to look in to that first.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Hmm, IRQ detection would be problematic as well, but there are usually ways to work around it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />If you can control the software on one cartridge, here's a way to do it:
<br />
<br />Let's say you have Cart A and Cart B.
<br />
<br />In Cart A, disable <em>all</em> interrupts (the DMC IRQ, the vblank NMI, everything), then copy some code to the internal ram ($0000-$07FF), and then jump to the code in RAM.
<br />
<br />The code to copy to RAM:
<br />Run a loop that spins on $2002, waiting for the vblank flag to be set. Then, read the joypad. Check for a certain button combo (like, pressing start, or start/select). If the combo isn't being pressed, branch back to the vblank wait.
<br />
<br />The idea is for you to press buttons on the controller when you've inserted Cart B. While the NES is running the code you put in RAM, it'll be completely safe to remove Cart A from the cartridge slot. Just keep in mind that any graphics you put on the screen will disappear while there's nothing in the slot. However, they'll reappear once you insert Cart B, so maybe you can copy the entire BG pattern table to the nametable as an indication to whether the cart's inserted properly or not? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />There's a small problem though, if you use a commercial game, you'll be forced to use its IRQ vector and routine. There's no way to change this without modifying the rom.

<br />That's risky though, but I guess if you can perform a SEI before the DMC IRQ occurs, then it wouldn't matter. Also, you'd need to be able to yank the cartridge out of the genie without removing the genie from the connector. Otherwise, I think whatever codes you put in will be erased.

<br />True. EDIT: I guess it should be possible to reprogram the Game Genie from the code in RAM by writing to some magic registers?
<br />
<br />If somebody is willing to write some tests and wants me to run them, please .org the code at $200. You can use $0-$2F and $1F0-$7FF for RAM (of course be careful not to overwrite any of your code <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ). The stack pointer is $FD at entry. Preferably there should be an RTS at the end of the code (this goes back to the bootloader). This would be helpful so that I can run the code using NRPC, which makes it easy for me to run several tests and read back the RAM in between them.

<br />I don't think the genie has any magic registers; it has to retain 100% compatibility with all games. As such, every single write has to pass through to the cartridge. Only the genie itself would be able to modify its internal state.

<br />It has to have some so that the code entry screen which is run at boot time can pass the codes to the GG hardware. I couldn't find any technical information about that however.
