<br />
<br />I read through some tutorials online and I'm still a bit confused, so please bare with me.
<br />
<br />I'm familiar with development in C(++) and Flash (with which I've already developed a couple of games) and would love to jump into NES development.
<br />
<br />With basic knowledge in both of those languages, what do I need to study and where should I go to begin some little projects for the NES? I'm capable of finding the necessary software but I haven't really found any in-depth tutorials on how code is handled.
<br />
<br />Thank you very much in advance for any response.

Also, read the "Nintendo Entertainment System Documentation" document on the main page.  This will give you an overview of how the NES works.

<br />I've had some experience with basic Assembler before, are they very similar? I don't have to move (MOV) values between parts of memory to do a multiplication right?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

Read as many 6502 docs/books as you can, and practice what you learn on the <a href="http://home.pacbell.net/michal_k/6502.html" class="postlink">6502 simulator</a>. It's an excellent tool to test your knowledge, and you don't have to bother about configuring assemblers and making ROMs just to understand how the CPU works.
<br />
<br />Once you have a decent understanding of the CPU (i.e. you can code a few routines to do basic things like multiplication and division, number sorting, and so on), you can study the PPU. Don't just read the docs though, use the debugging features of FCEUXD (for example) to observe how commercial games modify the palette, the name tables, attribute tables and so on. That, along with the docs, should give you a good idea of what the NES can do and how.
<br />
<br />Then you can start your first demo. Pick an assembler (I use ASM6 because it doesn't require any configurations, so it's very straightforward) and start making programs that animate sprites, draw background tiles, read the joypad, things like that. Soon the NES will feel like home.

<br />The 6502 is a very basic CPU, it doesn't even have built-in multiplication and division instructions, so if you really need those (you should avoid them as much as possible) you have to code your own routines, using bit shifting, additions and subtractions. There's definitely a lot of moving involved, although in 6502 assembly the terms are "load" (from memory) and "store" (to memory), not "move".

<br />In a way, yes, you do.  There's no "multiply" command so you will have to calculate using adds and shifting bits, and it's likely you won't be able to fit all the numbers into the registers at once so you will have to copy data back and forth.
<br />
<br />Alternatively there are faster ways to do multiplication using lookup tables.
<br />
<br />It gets pretty complicated at times!  Like others, I recommend the NES 101 tutorial that takes you through a simple program which you can modify to see real results and what affects what.

<br />
<br />I see. It seems to be a bit more complicated than I thought, but I did fiddle around with some basic assembler some years ago, so I suppose it can't be that hard.

<br />
<br />What you have to understand is that every task is performed in very small bits, and since each instruction does so little you need a lot of them in order to complete a more complex task.
<br />
<br />The most confusing thing about ASM, to me at least, were the status flags. Being used to IF and WHILE structures, I simply couldn't understand how the branch instructions worked. Just keep in mind that certain operations change the flags according to the result of these operations, and that the branch instructions will branch or not depending on whether flags are set or clear. If you understand that you can replicate every program flow structure found in high-level languages without problems.
<br />
<br />ASM is really fun though, you will not regret learning it. You will have freedom like you never had in any other language, and will be able to make optimizations that are impossible with anything else. And you will learn a lot about computer architecture.

<br />Great! I feel a bit spoiled with Flash, I think ASM will do me good <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />
<br />It seems a bit old (1986) but I assume documentation on 6502 can't be all that new anyways...  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />
<br />
<br />If not, is there a popular manual you can suggest?

<br />
<br />This is very true.  One of the pitfalls of 6502 for new comers is debugging.  Debugging NES code is harder to grasp than in high level languages (such as C++).  It can be very frustrating if you do not understand how the NES works internally.  You really have to know what your project code is doing at all times.
