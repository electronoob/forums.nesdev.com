<br />Altough it looks like that, yes, the author did mention it like if it was running on a NES. He talks about a "NES" version and not a version with NES graphics. Seeing the comments below is really confusing like "the NES would explose if it had to do it"... it's just SO untechnical, hopfully this was a joke

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys. Here is a <a href="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/raynes.swf" class="postlink">flash prototype</a> of the raycaster I've been planning for a while (there is no collision detection, so try not to go outside of the map). The NES can surely do this, the only question is how fast...
<br />
<br />In this prototype I'm using the same fixed-point precision and texture scaling as I would on the NES, so a ROM would look exactly like that. With some tricks I was able to reduce all coordinates to 16 bits (as opposed to the previous 24), but the maximum map size is 64x64 blocks (the prototype map is 16x16), although it should be possible to have map transitions or different floors in a real game to have larger levels.
<br />
<br />I also simplified the texture scaling to use only 8-bit integer calculations, so it should be pretty fast now. Drawing larger walls is slower, but since finding them is faster (because they are closer the ray doesn't extend much) there shouldn't be much difference compared to smaller walls (which are faster to draw but slower to find).
<br />
<br />Anyway, I think this looks interesting for the NES, even though the textures look pretty mangled when seen from a distance. Do you think it is too ugly or is there any interest in seeing this on the NES? I'm considering making a 3D shooter for the NES, but I have to know if you guys would cope with the low resolution.

<br />Yeah, this wouldn't be anything revolutionary in the gameplay department, it would be as basic as Wolfenstein I guess, so you probably wouldn't like playing it.
<br />
<br />I've always had an interest in raycasters, and enjoyed looking for implementations across different systems (specially the older ones, older than the raycasting technique itself), and liking the NES like I do I always felt bad there were no proper raycasters for it (the author of "Stuck in Castle Nessenstein" will excuse me, but it's full of glitches and it's PAL only - if I can't play on my NES it's not a NES game).
<br />
<br />So yeah, I might try this, even if the gameplay isn't very innovative. I'm not really sure about how to handle sprites yet though. If I use 8x8 I'll not be able to draw much, if I use 8x16 I won't be able to pre-render them with all possible patterns. I might end up making a few reusable parts (as opposed to every possible pattern) that objects are required to be built from which will be available in different sizes.

<br />Yes, but that isn't such a good thing because you'll be limited to 4 colors for the entire view... So the enemies/objects would share the same colors as the walls, which would look pretty dull and wouldn't stand out much. You may have seen some previous tests of mine that used 4x4 pixels. I gave up on that idea mostly because of the following reasons:
<br />
<br />1. 4 colors for everything is too little, the levels were too dull, they lacked "life";
<br />2. the poor vertical resolution made distant walls too indistinguishable;
<br />3. too many rays had to be cast because of the horizontal resolution, it would be almost twice as slow;
<br />
<br />I know, 8x2 pixels have a great impact on the horizontal resolution and can fuck up the texturing of distant walls, but I still get a better sense of 3D then I did with 4x4. Considering that I can also have more wall colors and faster rendering, it wasn't hard to decide in favor of the new pixel size.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I see your point. 4x4 pixels are awfully big, and for details/small things, they are undesirable. Though for sprites, if you make them part of the BG, your graphics will look a lot like Atari 2600 graphics with very wide pixels. Let's see some pros/cons of working with BG/sprites.
<br />
<br />BG Pros:
<br />
<br />-Anything made of 4 colors and 8x2 pixels can be displayed. ANY.
<br />-No size limits (besides 1 pixel for being as small as possible)
<br />
<br />BG Cons:
<br />
<br />-8x2 pixels on enemies/objects are very Atari 2600 seeming, maybe worse.
<br />-Only 4 colors
<br />-More time consumed computing final image, layering enemy graphics over the raycasted walls
<br />
<br />Sprite Pros:
<br />
<br />-Enemies can be placed anywhere on screen
<br />-Pixel size is not an issue, necessarily
<br />-Drawing sprites is easy compared to doing it with BG
<br />
<br />Sprite Cons:
<br />
<br />-Could be very hard to stay within the 64 sprite limit
<br />-Could be very hard to stay within the 8 sprites per scanline limit
<br />-Possibly hard to have all sizes and combinations predefined in 2BPP CHR format without eating too much space
<br />-If there are too many predefinitions graphically, one might consider using CHR RAM, in which case, VRAM updates would be horribly time consuming
<br />
<br />I think if you can't stand the way 8x2 pixel enemies look, you'll have to stick with sprites, it seems. It might be possible to do a combination of the two, and use sprite layering over the BG for 8x2 pixel sprites. Though you'd have to be clever as to not ever go beyond sprite scanline/page limits. Then there's always flickering, so you can display one enemy, then another, then another, etc. cycling through them all. I think it wouldn't be SO hard to make sure an enemy stays within 64 sprites. You might have to make them 8x16, as well as reduce their size.
<br />
<br />And enemies don't necessarily have to take up the entire screen if they're as close as possible. I would suggest, if you haven't, seeing how large you can make an enemy with 64 sprites. If you can make it so it looks pretty close, then that's good. You can then use the cycling method, or at least consider it. Otherwise, I'm not quite sure what to tell you... Perhaps the sprite+BG thing, but that could look weird...

<br />Well, if you use MMC3 (or whathver better mapper) IRQs so that you toggle $2000.0 at lines 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, ... (each 4 lines) you can get 4x2 pixels on the whole screen.

<br />Slowly.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I checked the Gameboy version and it appears to redraw all the patterns every (logic) frame.
<br />
<br />From the looks of it, it isn't a raycaster. It more likely calculates the positions and distances of the 2 points that form a wall section relative to the player and draws straight lines at the top and bottom connecting them, then fills the whole columns. It also seems to ignore distant walls.
<br />
<br />This is a valid technique, but FaceBall isn't something to draw inspiration from, IMO. It runs at, what? 2-3 frames per second? It's very annoying. The same technique is much faster on the SNES, but I'd expect the NES to be more similar to the GB.

<br />Now you are thinking like me. =) The NES always had flickering for objects, so it shouldn't be so weird in a raycaster.
<br />
<br />To keep objects from getting too big, enemies could have some sort of AI to walk away from the player when he's too close. I've also seen games (Zero tolerance on the MD/GEN maybe? Can't remember) use pretty large hitboxes for the characters, so it's impossible for them to be too close.
<br />
<br />Static objects should not be tall and should be attached to the floor or the ceiling, so that they get out of view if you're too close. Only very narrow objects should be tall, and even then the large hitbox should be used.
