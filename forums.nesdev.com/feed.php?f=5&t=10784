A picture of the underside would also be nice so that I can see what's connected to what.<br /><br />I'm a little bothered that the secondary transformer 4-&gt;5 is not big.<br /><br />And, yes, I mean desoldering C4 and seeing how it behaves when it's by itself. If it's still doing the wrong thing, then I'd replace it.<br />(the label on it: &quot;<span style="color: #FF0000">1</span><span style="color: #00FF00">0</span><span style="color: #00FFFF">4</span> 25V&quot; means a <span style="color: #FF0000">1</span><span style="color: #00FF00">0</span>×10<span style="color: #00FFFF">⁴</span> pF capacitor rated to a maximum of 25V. If it is broken, you can replace it with any other 0.1µF non-polarized capacitor that's rated for 25V or more)<br /><br />What are you using for voltage conversion? Can you turn it down below 1/2 input voltage? (e.g. a variac?) If so, at what input voltage does it blow the fuse?<br /><br />Another fantastic trick I've learned for debugging power supplies of whatever provenance: put a 60W incandescent non-halogen light bulb in series with the power supply. The light bulb will keep you from blowing a fuse, and brown-out the supply instead. Then you can use thermal debugging to figure out what's gone wrong.<br /><br />I'm not certain how the light bulb will work with voltage conversion... nevermind if you can even find a 120V light bulb there. I think it should still work if you put it in series with the 240V input to the voltage converter...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Fri Dec 13, 2013 8:55 pm</p><hr />

Same procedure, but leads don't matter which go to which pin, and set the multimeter to 200kΩ instead.<br /><br />Test the inductor L2. Set the multimeter to 2000kΩ and measure the resistance across the two pins of the inductor. It should start high and rapidly drop.<br />Test the transformer whose part number I can't see (but it's got &quot;75K&quot; on top). Do a similar test as for L2, but for the contacts that are on the same side.<br />er, let me try drawing a picture:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">o o o<br />+---+<br />|   |<br />+---+<br />o o o</div> I don't know if there are three on each side, but only measure all the ones on the same side.<br />Finally, make sure that the resistance between all the pins on the top and all the pins on the bottom is more than 2000kΩ<br /><br />Go ahead and test the only resistor, it's the big white block. Unfortunately, I can't see what resistance it's supposed to be because of the angle of the photos. Make sure that the resistance on it is approximately the same as what's specified.<br /><br />If all of these test out, the only thing remaining is the two big black blocks, which I'm not certain what to do with.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Fri Dec 13, 2013 2:57 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />That brown stuff isn't a problem; it just paint-on insulator.<br /><br />If it doesn't blow when the only big transformer is plugged in, the big transformer should be ok.<br />It'd be nice to find out what your multimeter said when it was measuring red-to-red and (either red)-to-blue. (You'd set the multimeter to 200VAC). I'm guessing 32VAC and 16VAC respectively, but it might show higher if your multimeter doesn't do true RMS, or if it's a 100VAC transformer instead of 120VAC.  But all of that should be academic: it doesn't blow the fuse when only the transformer is plugged in.<br /><br />So I'd start checking everything on the secondary board. There should be a couple diodes, although I can't see where. Maybe the left device on the heatsink? Make sure the capacitors aren't shorts (set to 200Ω resistance and red to +ve, black to -ve which is the side with the stripe) and wait a while to see if the capacitor charges by making sure that the resistance indicated slowly increases.<br /><br />If you can tell us part numbers off the ICs, that would be helpful.<br /></div><br />Which is VAC? v~ or the other one?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6229">MegaManSec</a> — Fri Dec 13, 2013 12:50 am</p><hr />

0.01 on the horseshoe looking setting. Shorted transformer which is causing more current to flow and blowing that fuse.<br /><br />EDIT 1: What about your mate's reading? This more for people who find this thread. You will need to get a new transformer by the sounds of things but doing a quick parts look I cant find any details on that transformer mate. Famicom Box schematic power supply (most combinations of that) may yield something but I have not found much.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4169">danntor</a> — Fri Dec 13, 2013 12:48 am</p><hr />
