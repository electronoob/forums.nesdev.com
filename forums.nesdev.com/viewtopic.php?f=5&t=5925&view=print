I would like to read on the subject and I know I could "just f$%#!@ google it" but I don't know which one is good since it's not my field.  I'm a little bit concerned to end up on the "gba guy" of electronics.. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Is there any tutorial people recommend on the subject? I should be able to have access to some part easily like a breadboard, resistances etc.
<br />
<br />My goal is not to make something complicated like a powerpak but more like learning the basic and having fun with simple circuits. Any information on the subject will be greatly appreciated.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You could somehow ( <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> ) get a copy of Electronics for Dummies, which I found very helpful. It explains a lot of fundamentals of Electronics that I didn't understand, and it helped me to understand them a lot better. It also says what you should have a constant supply of if you want to be working with electronics often among other things. I didn't finish the whole thing, and I didn't wrap my mind around everything they said because I kind of skimmed through the first part, but it seems to be a very good book, and I'd highly recommend it.
<br />
<br />Other than that, if anyone has good tutorials, I too would be very interested because I think electronics are quite fascinating. I can't believe someone came up with the concepts behind them and more than that I can't believe they work.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />we had this book as course literature in an introduction class in digital electronic at the uni: "Digital Fundamentals with VHDL‎" by "Thomas L. Floyd"
<br />might be a bit expensive (maybe available at your local library?) but it explains pretty much everything needed for fiddling with digital electronic.
<br />
<br />but just as programming, start experimenting as soon as possible... start with a breadbord, some 74xx ICs (logic gates), push buttons, and some LEDs (with resistors ofc) and get crackin ^^

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My issue is usually at my local library, that would means books in japanese so.. I would prefer them in english since my japanese is still not good enough for those things <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> The easiest access is on the web for anything I need so if there is any tutorial, I will be more than glad to read them.
<br />
<br />I will check if I can have access to the books you both mentioned but I would be very surprised. The only way will be by ordering them online.
<br />
<br />Getting the breadboard and a few components won't be an issue (I was at an electronic shop today looking at some sockets with lever) but I guess before I can fiddle with them, I need to learn a little bit about the basic to make sure I know what I'm doing and don't fry anything.
<br />
<br />edit: 
<br />
<br />- "Digital Fundamentals with VHDL‎" is easily 100$ (and up to 200$) on amazon jp hmm.. Electronic for dummies is cheaper but there is many version of them.

<br />The problem is that it's very easy to f*** something up if one wire isn't as you suppose it, etc...
<br />
<br />I guess the Tomas L. Floyd books are really popular since I've had some course based on a french tranlsation on them.

Some are extremely large when compared to regular PDF files though (Principles of Electric Circuits by Thomas Floyd is 550 MB, hopefully it's not a porn video), but that's probably because they have a lot of pictures. I guess I'll be studying some electronics too! =)

At one point it recommends that you lick a 9v battery. naturally its available for further previewing if you know what google is.

<br />
<br />Honestly though, even if it is not an option, the best way to learn this stuff is probably to go to school.  If that can't be done, hands on experience will probably be needed to make it so much easier, like with a breadboard to start out with.  I am going to start school for this stuff this year, and I am not touching any component for a while, not after making an LED explode...(want to ask me what it looked like?)

(try to do that in japan..) Now I'm evaluating and accumulating some info until I can have that time to read it and enjoy it. I will check that site, thanks for the link.
