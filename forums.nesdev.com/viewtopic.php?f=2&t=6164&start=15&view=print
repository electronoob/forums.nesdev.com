<br />It certainly works, but I'd call it a sloppy hack.  I think the better solution is to quit using parentheses.

<br />What I was trying to say there, was coming up with a hack just so we can write LDA (ABS),Y is kind of silly, there's no reason it can't be written as LDA ABS,Y instead.  blargg has something that works for him though, if ppl find it useful, then hey.. more power to them I guess.
<br />
<br />I understand the temptation to do what nesasm does, use brackets instead.  It does make sense.  I don't think it's worth it though.  You're violating a well established standard, making your assembler incompatible with a ton of code, and annoying a lot of old hats who've gotten by just fine with the way things are.
<br />
<br />This is all assuming someone is writing a tool they expect other people will want to use.  If you're just writing something for yourself, by all means... do whatever makes sense to you.
<br />
<br />I feel like I've gotten too defensive about this, and I'm not sure what I'm defending now.  Cheers, I'm having a beer.

<br />My original point really was that ASM6 silently decides what addressing mode I meant.  I thought it -- or any assembler -- should at least let me know.
<br />
<br />I guess you could take it to the extreme and say the assembler <strong>is</strong> letting me know by creating a binary that doesn't do what I expected it to do.
<br />
<br />I'm looking for compile-time notification versus run-time notification.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />

<br />
<br />Garbage in, garbage out.  The problem is it isn't telling you when your code is bad.  I do plan to fix it but it may be a few days before I get around to it.

<br /> But if ASM6 is for 6502, what does it matter what [] is used for on other processors. 6502 has no long indirection. Also, would it not be fairly easy to accept both [] and () syntax for addressing in the assembler? I.e. [] encountered implicitly implies short ZP indirect addressing. Or is [] reserved for something else in the assembler?
<br />
<br /> Or maybe a better idea would be to just use <em>lda (&lt;label),y</em> as forced ZP indirect indexed? (sorry if I got the "&lt;" in the wrong direction. I use PCEAS to assemble NES code. Different syntax system. So I don't remember all the other syntax rules).

The only characters that I've never seen used in a 65xxx assembler for actual opcode designation are braces (e.g. {}), but that's neither here nor there.<br /><br />The point here that's been partially lost in the chaos is that <strong>there is no</strong> lda (abs),y mode on the 6502.  If a label or equate expands to a 16-bit value (see original example code that started this thread), the assembler should throw an error.  Really.  :-)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tomaitheous wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Or maybe a better idea would be to just use <em>lda (&lt;label),y</em> as forced ZP indirect indexed?

<br />
<br />"lda (&lt;label),y" also will confuse the person viewing the source; same reason why blargg's "0+(label),y" syntax isn't something I would advocate using unless every use of such contained an inline comment explaining why it's there.
<br />
<br />If I saw "lda (&lt;label),y" I'd immediately say "Why is this forcing use of the low byte of the label/address?  There is no lda (abs),y on the 6502.  Indirect indexed is ZP only!"  Followed by hours spent trying to figure out if there IS a reason they're forcing the low byte of the label/address (e.g. somewhere else in the code using the high byte).
<br />
<br />loopy's already signed off on addressing the issue (pun intended), so there's really not much else to discuss as I see it.  Folks should be familiar with whatever assembler it is they're using -- and use listing generation to debug/verify behaviour of code or the assembler itself.  At least that's how we did it in the "old days".

<br />Thanks Loopy.  I think I will apply your .abs/.ind qualifiers idea generically to all instructions.  Consider JMP.  This might be slightly more ridiculous than my original concern, but I can imagine someone wanting JMP ($8000+variable) to be absolute.  Call me crazy...

<br />Why wouldn't that someone write JMP $8000+variable? If you want to support programmers who can't write what they want, why do you think said programmer won't write JMP.ind $8000+variable when he really wants absolute? You've already provided what the programmer needs to express himself, but he's chosen to misuse the tools. Catering to this misuse does a disservice to all other programmers. Besides, if anyone wants wla-dx, he should know where to find it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the main problem is that in other processors' assembly syntax, a 16-bit operand without parentheses is used to denote a value rather than an address, which is pretty common on the z80 for example, which allows the loading of a register pair with one 16-bit operand.  
<br />
<br />But on the 6502, using direct addressing is the rule rather than the exception, and there is no mode that uses a 16-bit operand as anything but a direct address (with the exception of the indirect address mode JMP also supports).  So the norm became to treat operands as addresses unless otherwise specified, rather than as values.  Parentheses became useful to denote indirect addressing, and 8-bit operands had to be handled similarly to the 16-bit ones to avoid confusion.  And of course with the obvious addition of using a 8-bit operand as a value, they had to use something to denote that, and...well, the hash mark.
<br />
<br />Now I consider myself somewhat adaptable, and in fact am quite capable of adjusting to the assembly syntax of other processors.  But I really don't see the point of changing what has already been in place for the 6502 just to make it more congruent with the assembly syntax of other processors.
