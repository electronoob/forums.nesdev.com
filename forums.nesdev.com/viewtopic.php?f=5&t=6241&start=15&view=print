<br />...except his post is from the afternoon of the 31st.  Premature?  Who knows.  I'm still uploading the video so that someone can decide what to do with him.  ;-)
<br />
<br />EDIT: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcss0bM8RcI" class="postlink">And it's finished</a>.  Please note that the audio frequency adjusting/speeding up/slowing down isn't an encoding bug -- I recorded the video in VirtualDub without compression during the capture phase (24GB!) and no audio rate conversion was done during the compression (e.g. it was recorded at 22kHz 16-bit mono), so it's some sort of weird bug with VirtualDub and/or Nestopia fighting over who has timer or thread priority.  Don't care to deal with it.  No OCD plz.
<br />
<br />Another thing to note is the cheat code I add to Nestopia.  The RAM addresses are what define how much energy you have.  $0106 bits 7-4 = energy digit singles place, $0107 bits 3-0 = energy digit tens place.  All this does is allow me to have infinite energy.
<br />
<br />Now back to adding H/W monitoring support to some BSD software I maintain...
<br />
<br />Admins can feel free to do what they want with this guy.

<br />
<br />It seems from more recent pics they changed it to blond later. Altough hair-color swap was common back in the NES days, even in my game the heroine is blonde but her sprites have dithered red/skin color cause if I did sprite overlay to make her blond it would end up flickering too much (altough I might change my mind just before the release of the game, I'll have to try both ways).
<br />
<br />The most crazy is in the PS2 game Atelier Iris : Eternal Mana (one of my all time favourites). The hero has dark brown hair in the CG intro, light brown hair on the pictures, red hair on in-game close-ups of him and blond hair on his in-game sprites.

<br />I already told you: It wasn't an April Fool's joke. I planned to post it even earlier, but you didn't lift my ban in time.
<br />By the way, I guess you are American, right? I assume that because you don't know the difference between nudity and porn.

<br />Porn is nudity that lacks serious artistic value. I don't want nesdev.com to become "that place you go to get Rule 34 pics of classic video game characters." (Oh wait, I think I just spilled the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:BEANS" class="postlink">beans</a>.)
<br />
<br />But I just want to make it clear that other members of this forum have indicated that they did not appreciate the page lengthening post consisting of a repeated misspelled name of a male genital, a C++ program to reproduce it, and two "huh huh, you said $dirtyword" posts. These <em>did</em> lack serious artistic value.
