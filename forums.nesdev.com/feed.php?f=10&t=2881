Well, the idea is to make games that are 100% compatible with the NES, in a way that any good emulator would also be able to run them. The primary goal should be the NES itself, but we usually use emulators along the way to make development easier.<br /><br />All software should be tested on hardware before being released, though. If you can't do that and can't find anyone who can (usually people here at NESDEV will test your programs on hardware if you can't), at least try it in various emulators, including Nintendulator, which is known to be the most accurate one.<br /><br />Welcome, and good luck! =)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Jan 17, 2007 1:23 pm</p><hr />

I just started programming in 6502 assembly yesterday as part of my course.<br /><br />I'm wondering what's needed, besides knowing the launguage, to create NES games? Do you guys create NES games from scratch, and do the games work on an emulator such as NESten?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2172">Maca</a> — Wed Jan 17, 2007 1:10 pm</p><hr />
