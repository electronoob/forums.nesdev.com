Ok so here is what happened. I removed the pull up resister and hooked the mic wire with the 10 k resister and cap as shown in the diagram and attached the 10k resister from the system sound to the mic line. I found r5 and r4 after looking around and hooked that up. So everything is as the schematic shows. Lucky i just bought myself an oscilloscope so I can look into the mic working or not when I get that and do some more snooping around. Do you know the specs of the mic. Is it a simple part that I can buy and replace or am I going to have to get a hole new famicom p2 controller. Also can I take a button and place it in replacement of the mic. I only ask this cause from what I see is that it acts as a sound activated button more than a mic. If I need a new controller the price of that vs just getting a actual famicom is out weighed. Im not sure if I mentioned but the famicom controllers hooked up to db-9 connectors so I can remove them like regular controllers. When I disconnect the p2 controller now I get a little sound like you would hear from plunging in or disconnecting a powered speaker. I am not sure if that is good or bad.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6598">thepandaofnom</a> — Thu Jul 17, 2014 9:25 pm</p><hr />

Yeah I saw that it's part of the main board on Enri's schematics now. One problem is that most games requires a certain amount of successful reads of the mic in a certain period of time for things to happen. But most microphones nowadays seems to have gone bad and are super insensitive as a result. Thus it's not strange if it doesn't work in Zelda or Kid Icarus, you might need to test it in a more sensitive testing program.<br /><br />I wonder if I could replace my mic for a new electret condenser microphone and see if it gets more sensitive.<br /><br />It would be interesting if someone would get this to work on their NES (as there actually are games that requires mic input <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.famicomworld.com/forum/index.php?topic=2355.0">http://www.famicomworld.com/forum/index ... pic=2355.0</a><!-- m -->). Though for my own sake, as a Famicom user, I would like to add the missing START and SELECT for controller II. At least the non-Japanese versions of Battletoads requires it for two player mode.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6013">Pokun</a> — Sat Jul 12, 2014 4:57 pm</p><hr />

Ok so i had a look at this and i set it up. I added the two 10k resister and the cap put it together as show tied to d2 witch is pin 15 of the nes exp port and it still doesn't work. the only test equipment i have is a multi meter. I cant afford an oscilloscope. the other thing is when I look at the schematics and then look at my mother board their are differences such as not having a r4 and r5 as shown but r1 and r2 are their but labeled as r4 and r3. I may just buy a famicom because I want this to work but it looks like it isn't possible and I am no electronic engineer so i don't have the skills necessary to do this. I know I can av mod a famicom. Thank you guys for your help and feed back.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6598">thepandaofnom</a> — Mon Jul 07, 2014 5:29 pm</p><hr />

(One side should be ground, the other should contain the signal). Can you see/hear audio from that pin? If not, something's wrong immediately around the microphone.<br />If you can, do you see/hear audio on the output of the amplifier inside the controller? (pin 2 of the 4069 inside) If not, something's wrong with the amplifier.<br />Next, test the input side of the pertinent 74'368 on the NES mainboard (This should be pin 10 of U7). If not, something else is wrong; maybe one of the diode arrays.<br />Finally, see if you can toggle the readback of that pin: short that same pin 10 to ground.<br /><br />There are some differences between &quot;just connecting the controller to $4016.2&quot; and what the famicom does, but I'm not yet clear that matters.

I started a discussion on the famicom world forums ( <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.famicomworld.com/forum/index.php?topic=10859.0">http://www.famicomworld.com/forum/index ... ic=10859.0</a><!-- m --> )about getting help to hook up my famicom p2 controller to my U.S. toaster nes and I have so far had no luck getting the mic to work. I have a famicom p1 and p2 hooked to my toaster and they both work great all buttons work and respond well. Through a bit of googling and some forum searching I found that all I should have to do was hook up the mic wire to the pin 6 of my famicom exp port I made on the front of my nes or pin 15 of the nes exp port. I have tried multiple ways. the first way was connecting p2 controller to the p2 connections on the nes port itself with the mic wire hooked to nes exp port pin 15. Then i tried hooking the hole p2 controller to a db 15 connector and plunging it into my famicom exp port. once again the controller works but no mic. the last effort i did was to wire the p2 controller directly to the nes exp port. After many attempts and it not working I have decided to stop muddling around with it till I can get advice from people who may know more than I do. I am not sure if i need to make an extra circuit to make this work because people have taken the av famicoms and put a famicom exp conecter on a p2 famicom controller to use the mic on the av famicom. If anyone can help out I would be thank full. I am starting to think this isn't possible because their is no info on doing this on the toaster nintendo from all my googleing.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6598">thepandaofnom</a> — Mon Jul 07, 2014 1:25 pm</p><hr />
