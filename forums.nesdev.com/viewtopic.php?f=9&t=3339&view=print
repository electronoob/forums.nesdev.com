<br />i could use the audio-in line to get sound out of the TV, and maybe the controller lines to change CD-Tracks and stuff like that..  only thing i don't know about, is polling the information about the CD currently playing..  would the one address line (A15) be enough for that?

<br />that was the hoax, the one i just admitted today (that was already like 5 days old)..
<br />
<br />i was hoping to use the expansion port though, for the drive to sit under it like a Sega CD, but use a cartridge for a BIOS (unless there's a way to load data from the expansion port.)
<br />
<br />im actually curious if this would actually work...

So you either have to solder wires or have the resources to have custom connectors made.  If you really only <em>need</em> it for rerouting the audio though, just a jumper wire could do that (and it's already kind of a standard mod for people who want expansion sound with a Famicom cart adapter).
<br />
<br />A lot of people have built IDE interfaces for 6502, I don't think ATAPI is too much different.  I'm pretty sure all of the signals you'd need are on the cart connector.  I don't know where exactly to find the info about getting a music CD to play though.  I imagine you'd need to read and write commands to the drive, so AFAIK it could be about the same as interfacing to it for data.

<br />because that portion isn't even about the NES..  on a CD audio controller circuit, you'd have to "poll" it for information (meaning, READ the controller), and you'll have the track information and time information, which actually comes from the CD sub channels...  That would be useful to display on the TV...

<br />
<br />Listen, if would have only used my links (and NESdev) instead of pointlessly reiterating you may be somewhere. Read the digital tutorial to understand Chris' 6502 computer page, particularly address decoding and his IDE circuit. From there remap his IDE interface to free NES I/O. After that, Google how to "poll" the drive because as you're aware, this is a NES board, naturally people here would be best suited to helping you with the NES aspects. You're on your own to implement (and write the "bit-banging" code for) the interface.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />wait wait wait, im not talking about IDE..  I'm talking about a standard CD AUDIO player..  NOT IDE..  This isn't for storage or anything, so im not wasting my time with that..
<br />
<br />This is what I want this to do (and don't take me out of context):  Take an old portable CD player, and have the controller buttons map to the actually buttons on the player.  When a controller button is pushed, the expansion port forwards these "shorts" to the buttons, therefore controlling the CD layer...
<br />
<br />I don't understand A15, THATS WHY I AM ASKING, so stop being rude..  Obviously, this CD player has an LCD that shows the current track and time..  From reading the specs on the controlling chip in the player, it has a dedicated serial line for this information (if it was used in a different application)..  I am wondering if that information can be used somehow..  OR if I would have to pre-encode it to something the NES can use, and forward it to the cartridge for use in the PRG memory (or possibly the character memory)...
<br />
<br />i don't know about the expansion bus, this is why i am asking...
<br />
<br />This isn't to be hard at all, this is like the easiest of all things possible..  Simply shorting the connector pads on the player would cause it to think the button was pushed..  the NES can forward those controller pushes (doesn't it?), or somehow write code to push each and every individual button..  Though, I think a PIC should be involved, it seems with that this whole thing would be easier..
<br />
<br />I'm seriously thinking about just forgetting the idea..  The concept is nice, but the implementation is crazy.

<br />You could just solder 3 wires form your CD player to the NES expansion connector : Solder both grounds together, and solder both left and right audio to audio in trough two resistors. And you get a CD player for the NES.

<br />yea, you could do that, but then you can't control it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />i would like to see it possible to control the CD player itself..  if that's not gonna be possible, then forget it.  was a good idea, but if implementation just gonna get crazy, then im not gonna bother with it...
<br />-------------------------------------------------------
<br />perhaps the IDE route would be better, and just to modify the cart..  you could tell an ATAPI based drive simple commands to control it's CD player, and what's better, those drives will always tell the status..  (even disc rotation speed)...

<br />hmm, maybe that would work (im not familiar with the controller ports), but then there would be no audio connection, unless it had a patch cable...  I think the cartridge idea is better, so that way the cart can also have a program to actually utilize it, and draw a nice interface on the screen..

<br />
<br />but i had an idea.  why not just have an audio patch cable?  audio out of the NES, into the drive, and the drive spits out audio to the TV, with stereo CD sound, and mono NES sound..  (unless the NES is stereo modified)
