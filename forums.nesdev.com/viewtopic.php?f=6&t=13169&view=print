		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have encountered an interesting problem in Famitracker, when using DPCM samples. I made a thread about it on the Famitracker forum, but nobody replied, so I'm hoping somebody here can help.<br /><br />I would like to use some DPCM bass for some of my projects. I want the samples to be really small, so I can have more space for drum and maybe sound effect samples and fit it all in the 16KB space, dedicated to DPCM data. So I made a bunch of Saw Wave samples for different notes. Each one is short and small. The way I would play longer notes is by looping them. And here is where I ran into an issue. When they loop, the samples sound like arpeggios are being used or something. As if there is some silence either in the beginning or the end of the sample, which ruins the clear sounding of the loop. And when creating those samples, I made sure they sound clear, when looping.<br /><br />When I looked at the waveform in Famitracker, I noticed this:<br /><img src="http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/AlienX97/DPCM_zpspmcegkl3.png" alt="Image" /><br />The compression has changed the beginning and ending of the wave. Is there a way to prevent this from happening? If I try using a sample with one wave cycle, this problem doesn't appear, but the pitch gets changed and every sample sounds like the same note. Perhaps the current length of the samples I'm using isn't right. If so, can someone tell me how long is the selection I've made in the screenshot and will this solve the problem with the looping?<br /><br />I've included an FTM with one of the samples and the original .wav file.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The DPCM sample length (in bytes) has to be of form 16*n+1 (where n=0, 1, 2, ..., 255). Most likely FamiTracker is padding the sample because of that. If you want clean looping samples, I think it's best if you familiarize yourself with how the APU DPCM channel actually works: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/APU_DMC">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/APU_DMC</a><!-- m --><br /><br />It might be easier to construct the samples manually in a hex editor (or by writing a custom tool) rather than use the WAV import for it. That way you have full control over what APU is doing.<br /><br />...<br /><br />EDIT: For example, here's a saw(ish) DPCM wave that loops perfectly at amplitude 32:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Offset(h) 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F<br /><br />00000000&nbsp; 73 73 73 77 73 73 73 77 73 73 73 77 73 00 00 00&nbsp; ssswssswsssws...<br />00000010&nbsp; 00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.</div><br />The 73, 77 section ramps the waveform down, and the 00 section ramps it back up. Of course only a limited range of frequencies can be covered by a single sample, so you'd have to have variations for different frequencies, while keeping the sample length restriction in mind at the same time.<br /><br />EDIT2: I guess I should've also mentioned this technique developed by blargg that plays saw, pulse and triangle waves in the DPCM channel by playing a 1-byte sample at varying frequencies: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.slack.net/~ant/misc/nes-saw/">http://www.slack.net/~ant/misc/nes-saw/</a><!-- m --> It requires custom code and IRQs though, so you can't directly use it in FamiTracker.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks! That explained a lot, though I still have a question. When I asked about the selection, I didn't ask about file size, but time. So, how long would 1 byte from a sample play at rate 15? According to the wiki, 8 bits, played at rate 15 are equal to 4 scanline lengths. What does it mean by that? 4 scanlines(in which case, I'd have to find out the time it takes for the TV to draw a scanline), 4 pixels, what exactly?<br /><br />Also, creating the samples in a hex editor is a pretty cool idea, but figuring out how to make a sample play an exact frequency is a pain in the ass and it also wouldn't work for some other samples I want to use. So, what I need to do right now is edit the original wave file, so that the lenght and playback rate match the ones, that can be used by the DPCM(for instance, have the file size match the formula and have the playback rate roughly around 33144.94 Hz). And for that I would need the time it takes to play a given portion of the sample. If those things are impossible, then I need to know what kind of algorithm does Famitracker use to compress the files, so that I can make the proper adjustments.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">dougeff wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I think a good strategy for DPCM samples is - first in Audacity trim all silence from before and after the sample.

I never said I'll have them play at the same time, though I have an interesting idea, that could simulate that. Once this problem's taken care of and I finish the track, I will post it, so you can see for yourself.

They're just there for people who might want to use the DPCM IRQ as a makeshift scanline IRQ.<br /><br />If you're playing at rate 15, the frequency of playback (of 1-bit samples) is 1789773/54 Hz ~= 33143.94 Hz (check the table in wiki). Every byte contains 8 1-bit samples, so divide by 8 to get the frequency of how often sample bytes are fetched.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I looked at your sample...<br /><br />I think lower and longer and louder original samples sound better looped. The sample you have is too short and too quiet. Quiet, you get alot of artifact noise from the DMC sampling process. Short, you get more artifacts and misaligned peaks in the looping process, and you get a loop buzz (I don't know the technical term for this, but if you loop ANY sample short enough you get weird high pitch buzz, the shorter the loop the higher pitch the buzz).<br /><br />Lower notes work better, because it's easier to match the peaks up in a loop without clipping (repeated clicks).<br /><br />NES technology was just not designed to produce great looped samples. I was able to produce a less stuttered / noisy sample from your wav with a lot of modification (doubling it's length, boosting its volume, editing in hex editor), but it's still pretty noisy. Sounds a bit like a buzzing bee.

To cover the pop/blip at the loop point, you can crossfade the waveform with its original phase just before the loop; this creates a phased/layered sound variation just before the loop, but it could be a lot less objectional than the pop/blip.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's cool. I was thinking about this exact thing recently.<br /><br />My issues with it<br />-there are quite a lot of samples (53), some seem to be unused.<br />-some of the samples are large (1000+ bytes), and maybe not even used.<br /><br />But sounds good. Thanks.
