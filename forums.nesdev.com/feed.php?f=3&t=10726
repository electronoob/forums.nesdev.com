I feel that test ROMs are a legitimate tool for getting emulators working. For someone like me who knew pretty much NOTHING about the 6502, they were a VALUABLE debugging tool in figuring out where my code was going wrong. If nestest didn't exist I'd probably STILL be debugging my emulator and hoping it was correct.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6295">codeblox</a> — Mon Jan 06, 2014 9:42 am</p><hr />

In byuu's progression, I've always seen myself as someone who finds things that are almost complete, but lacking those final little things to make them basically complete, those little details that make a big difference, and tries to fill them in.<br /><br />As for the test ROMs, I've generally tried to target things that are difficult to check through other means, rather than cover all the basic things thoroughly. I see it as a matter of effort versus value. It's easy enough to use SMB as a test to get all those things working (and have fun watching the game go from garbage to working).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Wed Nov 27, 2013 8:24 pm</p><hr />

I can't fathom a world in which a test rom would be considered cheating. *Everything* is a test rom, it's just a question of how tightly controlled the situations are. They're a way of determining, fairly directly, the answer to the question &quot;What did the Real Thing do in this particular case&quot;. It's the difference between theoretical physics and applied. One of those considers the problem, writes it down, thinks really hard, and writes down the answer. The other smashes some protons together to see what comes out.<br /><br />Both are needed, and both are valid approaches. Personally, as a developer, I much prefer debugging cases with clean, reproducible tests. They leave a lot more energy left afterwards to develop more cool stuff. It does feel awesome when you finally track down and squish some evil, obscure bug through Guru level thought experiments, elbow-deep postmortem examination, and a brutal bit of luck on timing a reset or whatnot, but the only thing one feels like doing afterwards is celebrating, and not looking at code for a while.<br /><br />As for the pile of test roms we have available, they are deceptive. My FPGA NES passed every sprite 0 test there was, cleared almost all of the timing and CPU tests (precise timing of the even/odd dropped dot still elude it), and all the APU tests. It still failed cart.nes and smb1 immediately. Things they didn't catch:<br /><br />Sprite evaluation continuing with rendering disabled, clobbering the OAM address<br />No sprites showing up at all after hitting 8 on a scanline<br />Backwards, page-crossing BCCs going forwards instead<br />Envelope loop flag being hooked up to the half frame pulse instead of the reg bit<br /><br />No testsuite is completely bugtight.<br /><br />re: byuu's last post<br /><br />Some application developers use frameworks, some write straight Win32 or Xlib code. Some use C++, some use C#. All are still application developers.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8">ReaperSMS</a> — Wed Nov 27, 2013 7:00 pm</p><hr />

It is interesting the extreme spectrums that exist.<br /><br />The more you put into doing your own research and running your own tests, the more the emulator becomes an expression of something you've created, rather than copied.<br /><br />You start from the beginning, with a pure black box. At best, you can determine the CPU type and find an official programming guide for it. But you have to work out the memory mapping, every register, etc from scratch.<br /><br />Then you have increasingly thorough and useful documentation.<br /><br />Then you have a huge swath of test ROMs telling you what to fix and how to fix it.<br /><br />Then you have entire processor cores, where you just write the glue code to bind them all together (fairly common in the Genesis scene.)<br /><br />Then you basically have entire emulators as libraries, where you write a frontend for it.<br /><br />Each level probably thinks of themselves as &quot;emulator authors&quot;, and hell maybe they are, even the frontend people. But they're definitely distinct tiers. And depending on which tier you are on, you probably ask why the lower tiers even bother.<br /><br />It seems very much to mirror the progressions of programmers in general: the EE logic gate types/Verilog programmers -&gt; the assembly programmers -&gt; the C programmers -&gt; the C++ programmers -&gt; the Ruby/Python programmers.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Wed Nov 27, 2013 6:57 pm</p><hr />

Actually, test ROMs don't really point at exact place of a problem. They give a direction for search, but they can't detect a wide range of potential problems, and can give false reports, either giving you a false direction, or false sense of correctness (report OK while emulation is in fact wrong). There were threads on this forum with such cases.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Wed Nov 27, 2013 5:34 am</p><hr />

Correct.

Test roms isn't some magical thing that will make all bugs in your code disappear. They do help, but not that much as it seems to be imposed in this thread. Considering how much other kinds of help is involved into any software development anyway (experience of other people and their creations - compilers, text editors, etc), I don't think it is even worth of discussion. If you want to have extra fun catching bugs, just don't use test ROMs; if you want to get result a little bit sooner, use them and all other possible debug tools.
