Copying the data to PPU RAM becomes more indirect, because you'll need to load a byte from the map and use that byte as an index to read the tiles from the metatile definitions, which you'll then write to VRAM.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Is this done before NMI interrupt, I guess it is. I actually have all my code within the NMI ruotine now, I don't think that's the way to do it.

You can still have everything in the NMI, but do the PPU updates first (to make sure they happen during VBlank), and then process the game logic for the next frame.<br /><br />Having the game logic outside of the NMI and graphical updates in the NMI will result in a more robust program structure though, so if you are up to it, I recommend it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Just to confirm, is the idea to calculate a byte offset and add that offset to the adress of the first byte in the collision map, then check if this byte represent solid tile?<br /></div><br />Yeah, but since you are using bits to represent the solidity of each tile, just checking bytes won't do, you'll have to use masks in order to check the individual bits.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />if so is it not possible without using 2x2 metatile size, becouse of the byte offset calculated being greater then what a 8bit register can hold?<br /></div><br />You can access arrays with more than 256 entries if you use pointers, but that's not really necessary in your case because you are using bits for the solidity, so you really only have (32 * 30) / 8 = 120 bytes for the collision data.<br /><br />You just have to find the formula to convert the sprite coordinates to collision map coordinates. The sprite coordinates are measured in pixels, while the collision coordinates are measured in 8x8-pixel tiles (unless you decide to use metatiles, but since this is not the case yet I'll stick to the tiles), so you discard the lower 3 bits of the coordinates (just shift the numbers right 3 times). These 3 bits indicate where in the tile your point of interest is, but that info is meaningless because you are not doing pixel collision, just tile collision.<br /><br />So now you have 2 5-bit values. The Y value indicates the row (0 to 31), and if you pay attention to your collision data you'll see that there are 4 bytes per row, so you multiply the Y coordinate by 4 (shift it left twice) to locate the start of the row you want. Now X. There are 4 bytes in a row, and each byte has 8 bits. Use the top 2 bits (a value between 0 and 3) of the 5-bit X coordinate to find which byte, and the lower 3 (a value between 0 and 7) to find the bit.<br /><br />So, to find the byte you use: <strong>(Y / 8) * 4 + (X / 64)</strong><br /><br />And to find the bit you use: <strong>(X / 8) AND 7</strong><br /><br />I'm sure you know how to read the byte, but maybe I need to elaborate on the bit. you will probably need a table like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">BitMasks:<br />   .db %10000000<br />   .db %01000000<br />   .db %00100000<br />   .db %00010000<br />   .db %00001000<br />   .db %00000100<br />   .db %00000010<br />   .db %00000001</div><br /><br />So, once you have calculated the index of the bit you need, you use that index to load a value from this table. Then you can AND it with the byte read from the collision map, and if the result is 0, the tile is air, otherwise it's solid.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Nov 26, 2010 1:32 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">picccca wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I don't really know what meta-tile size is or which size I use for the collision.<br /></div><br />Metatiles are groups of tiles that you use to build the levels. NES games typically use a metatile size of 2x2 tiles, because that's the area covered by each entry in the attribute table, but 4x4 is also very common. This is actually a form of compression, since a whole screen can be defined in just 240 bytes if you are using 2x2 metatiles, while 1024 are needed if you are just using raw name/attribute table data.<br /><br />You <strong>don't need</strong> metatiles to implement collision detection though, that's optional. If the large size of raw screens is not a problem for you, there's no need to overcomplicate things. You just have to keep in mind that the blocks that form your level are 8x8 pixels (the size of a NES tile).<br /><br />Now, collision detection with the background works like this: You first move the character/object in the direction he's supposed to go, then you check if this movement caused it to enter any blocks it shouldn't have, if so, you eject it back.<br /><br />If the character moved right, you need to calculate its top-right and bottom-right points, then translate those to coordinates inside your collision map, and finally scan all the blocks from the top one to the bottom one. If any of those is solid, you eject the character to the left.<br /><br />Note that if the character moved right, there is no need to check its left side, because there is no possible way for it to collide in that direction, so don't do any unnecessary calculations. The same thing is true when moving up or down.<br /><br />Also, test for collisions in each axis separately. Move horizontally, check for horizontal collisions and eject horizontally; then move vertically, check for vertical collisions and eject vertically. If you don't, your character might end up going through corners and other nasty stuff.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Nov 25, 2010 9:36 pm</p><hr />

What you need to do for doing sprite -&gt; BG collision, is to compute a set of points arround the sprite (typically the 4 corners), and have a routine that compute their equivalent position on the background map (typically it is just shifting a value right, dropping the low bits - depending on which meta-tile size you use for collision, and how many bits you use to position your sprite).<br /><br />If all points are "false" collision then your sprite is free to move, but if any point becomes "true", you can't have it moving.<br /><br />Of course you can improve it at a later stage to support for more stuff (this method of 4 points won't work well for very large sprites, for instance, as some part of solid BG could "slip" between the point), but this should at least get you started.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Nov 25, 2010 3:03 am</p><hr />

Ok, I'm stuck. I can not for anything get my collision detection to work. I have read so many posts on the subject, so I have a clue as to what must be done, but I just can't get it to work.<br /><br />What I have so far is a background and a moving sprite. This is how I made the background.<br /><br />I have the background nametable like so:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">background:<br />      .db $0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0  ;;row 1<br />      .db $0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0  ;;<br /><br />      .db $0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0  ;;row 2<br />      .db $0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0  ;;<br /><br />.<br />.<br />.<br /><br />      .db $1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1  ;;row 29<br />      .db $1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1,$1  ;; THE FLOOR<br /><br />      .db $0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0  ;;row 30<br />      .db $0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0,$0  ;<br /></div><br /><br />And then it is copied to PPU RAM $2000 like so:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LoadBackground:<br />      LDA $2002<br />      LDA #$20<br />      STA $2006<br />      LDA #$00<br />      STA $2006<br /><br />      LDA #$00<br />      STA pointerLo<br />      LDA #HIGH&#40;background&#41;<br />      STA pointerHi<br />      <br />      LDX #$00<br />      LDY #$00<br />BGOutsideLoop:<br />BGInsideLoop:<br />      LDA &#91;pointerLo&#93;, Y<br />      STA $2007<br /><br />      INY<br />      CPY #$00<br />      BNE BGInsideLoop<br />      <br />      INC pointerHi<br />      <br />      INX<br />      CPX #$04<br />      BNE BGOutsideLoop<br /><br /></div><br /><br />I also have some collision data harcoded to start with:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">CollisionData:<br />      .db %00000000, %00000000, %00000000, %00000000 ;row1&#40;air&#41;<br />      .db %00000000, %00000000, %00000000, %00000000 ;row 2&#40;air&#41;<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />      .db %11111111, %11111111, %11111111, %11111111 ;row29&#40;floor&#41;<br />      .db %00000000, %00000000, %00000000, %00000000 ; row30&#40;air&#41;<br /></div><br /><br />Zeros are air and ones are solids.<br /><br />Then I have CollisionData copied to RAM like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LoadColData:<br />      LDA coltab<br />      STA pointerLo<br />      LDX #$00<br />LoadColDataLoop:<br />      LDA CollisionData, x<br />      STA pointerLo, x<br />      INX<br />      CPX #$78<br />      BNE LoadColDataLoop<br /></div><br /><br />The variable coltab is declared like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">coltab  .rs $78 ;  120 bytes, 1 bit per background tile &#40;0 air, 1 solid&#41;<br /></div><br /><br /><br />Now for the gravity, I want to look up in the CollisionData table if the tile underneth the sprite is solid or not. I have gotten this far:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">      LDX MarioX        ; Sprite X-pos.<br />      LDY MarioY        ; Sprite Y-pos.<br /><br />      ;Calculating Y-tile number<br />      TYA<br />      LSR A<br />      LSR A<br />      LSR A  ; divide by 8<br />      INC A<br />      INC A  ; add 2 rows, to get under the sprite<br /><br />      ;Calculating X-tile number<br />      TXA<br />      LSR A<br />      LSR A<br />      LSR A   ; divide by 8<br /><br /></div><br /><br />So far I think is correct, but what comes after that. First I had some idea to calculate what adress the tile below the sprite is at, like this:<br />      $2000 + (32*SpriteY) + 32 + SpriteX<br />But it seams like I then would need to calculate som 16bit numbers or something.<br /><br />So the question is basically what do I do next.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4638">picccca</a> — Thu Nov 25, 2010 2:30 am</p><hr />
