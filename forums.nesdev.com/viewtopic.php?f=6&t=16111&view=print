		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Over the weekend I wrote a music engine that runs in a constant number of cycles per frame.  The intention was to have an engine that could be hidden in timing-critical code such as parallax effects, and also to avoid the dreaded lag spikes. Currently, the cycle count is 766, which makes it far faster than other open-source engines. For comparison, Famitone peaks at 3000+ cycles and GGSound peaks at 5000+. I think Pently peaks at 2500+, but I'm not sure.<br /><br />The converter converts from Famitracker and supports instruments with Pitch/Volume/Arpeggio/Duty. Nothing else is supported; no effects nor volume columns. DMC is not supported, <s>nor are sound effects or PAL pitches</s>.<br /><br />It uses 12 bytes of zeropage and $100-$156 in stack space. The converted songs are not as space efficient as other engines, but they're small enough for my purposes.<br /><br />Anyway, you can find the code here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/pubby/penguin">https://github.com/pubby/penguin</a><!-- m --> Keep in mind this is not a library; I wrote the code for myself.<br /><br />I'll attach a ROM that plays Ralph 4's music.

This could ease raster split a lot, perhaps impressive parallax scrolling could be done in-game without even needed neither sprite-zero hits nor IRQs.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks.<br /><br />The newest update adds sound effects and PAL pitches.<br /><br />Sound effects were implemented as one-off instruments that play single notes. This makes them zero-cost; memory and cycles were not increased. PAL pitches on the other hand added 24 cycles and 2 bytes zeropage. The current cycle count is now 790 per frame.

Sound engines needs not supporting PAL or NTSC pitches at runtimes - they should just be configured at compile time to run either version.<br /><br />Yes, technically you *could* have a runtime check and this comes with some advantages (only one version of the ROM), however that's not how it's typically done - most of the time you'd want to have one NTSC version and one PAL version of the ROM, and all the difference is made compile-time only.

The repo has been updated.<br /><br />I forgot to mention, but it does support the full range of pitches and duty cycles, which Famitone does not. The ROM usage is pretty bad though; about 2x that of Famitone. Maybe one day I'll optimize it better.

Sadly, the mini game got shelved indefinitely as elseyf needed to tend to other things. It is meant to use the cycle constancy to reliably time a few scroll splits without irq support.

But to compensate for the lack of Sxx and Gxx, someone might need to use speed 3 to get (say) thirty-second-note resolution at 150 BPM. How would an engine that splits work over four frames cope with speed 3?<br /><br />Also <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">throw std::runtime_error&#40;&quot;pattern size not multiple of 8&quot;&#41;;</tt> would blow up on the 36-row patterns of the 2 AM theme in <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=212394#p212394" class="postlink">the FamiTracker version of the <em>Thwaite</em> soundtrack</a>, which is in 9/8 time.
