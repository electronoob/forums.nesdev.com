You helped me with a lot of NES-programming-related things.<br />You gave me the idea of using the nine sprites overflow bit as a second scanline split next to sprite 0, so that parallax scrolling and a status bar was possible without timed code.<br />You improved CC65's random number generator.<br />You explained me how to implement jump physics.<br />You helped me optimizing things in the early develoment phase where my lack of low-level experience put me into situations that made the game unplayable.<br />And much more, especially regarding Assembly code and NES-specific details.<br />Without you, this game would have not become the way it is now.<br />Thank you.<br /><br /><br />If you have any questions about the game, just ask me.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Video of gameplay from level 2:<br /><!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eee0yurkIW4">www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eee0yurkIW4</a><!-- w -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The boxes were created by a company that didn't do a good job: They were too thick and looked quite crooked when put together. Also, the colors were too powerful.<br />The publisher used another company than the one he usually uses because they were able to create them quicker since I wanted the game to come out early.<br /><br />The new boxes have the same quality as their other ones: Thinner, better colors and a shiny surface.<br /><br />The artwork on the labels looked washed-out and the material bubbled up.<br />Also, there were graphical artifacts that I thought was by the printing process, but then I found out that they resized our template file with nearest neighbor technology, so that single pixels are duplicated.<br /><br />The second label, from another company, had the colors not staying in place.<br />Also, they changed our template file without notifying us.<br />(It was marginal, but I still notice this kind of stuff. And changing my files is a big no-no. They are supposed to inform me and then I'll send them a new file.)<br /><br />In the end, we took the first company again, but this time the company agreed to print the labels on better, professional material that you usually only get when producing a whole lot. But I guess it was a compensation for their labels bubbling up. And this time I had the publisher tell them that they are not allowed to resize or change anything in the file at all, not even a single pixel.<br />And this one finally seemed to have worked as you can see in the new screenshots.
