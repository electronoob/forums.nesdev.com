		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry LIJI, it's taking me a bit more time to make a good test ROM. I think I've run into some unexpected behavior. What I'm trying to do is make a test pattern and change the value of SX at different points during scanline rendering. Early testing about our &quot;SX latching&quot; theory may need some adjustments. I can definitely write to SX during Mode 2 (OAM), but curiously Mode 0 (Hblank) seems to ignore any new values of SX. The next line isn't scrolled at all.<br /><br />I don't know if that is news to anyone, but it makes sense why so many games use the LY == LYC IRQ when changing SX midscreen. A timely LY == LYC IRQ should happen during Mode 2. No idea what happens when we try writing SX during Mode 3, most likely the same as Mode 0. Don't know if that helps, or if that muddies up things even more. I'll have to adjust the test ROM to account for this, so I'll probably have something ready later during the day/night.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Alright, I think this is good enough. Forget about what I said earlier. Seems you can change SX in Mode 2, Mode 3, and Mode 0 and still have it take effect on the next line. Not being able to get it working on HBlank was just my bad coding <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Anyway, it's simple. The test ROM just shifts a fullscreen pattern by 0 or 1 every other line (the original pattern is already shifted every other line, so SX changes &quot;correct&quot; it). The result should create a series of vertical bars. The source code is attached as well as the ROM. Nothing fancy, but I've messed around with the OAM-STAT IRQ a few times to get it working with Modes 2, 3, and 0. Same result on real hardware. Nothing changes on the current line, just the next one. My guess is the latched value for SX is determined between the end of Mode 0 and the start of Mode 2.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The 1st line should be in sync with the rest. Technically, the very last pixel on some of the scanlines should be messed up as well, but I haven't pinpointed why that seems to happens on real hardware.<br /><br />To me, it looks like you're applying SX = 1 to the 1st scanline. This shouldn't happen. Every even line should have SX = 0, and every odd line should have SX = 1. The only time SX is changed is in those OAM-STAT interrupts. I think what you're dealing with is some obscure (and poorly documented) behavior with the last scanline in VBlank that affects Line 0's STAT interrupts and LYC interrupts. For more info, check out Kirby's Dream Land 2's intro with LYC == 0 IRQ. Line 153 does some funky stuff, and it looks like that's at play here. Try stepping the test ROM through BGB for a closer look.
