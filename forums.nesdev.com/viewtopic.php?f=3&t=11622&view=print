If not so much, then go with a dual core pentium or equiv. GPU? Probably anything with 2D accel can be just XP-like hardware or above. As OpenGL/DX will be provided with the API version, in which case you need to look at the functions you use, and see when they got added in to the API basically. And sound, eh, I wouldn't even worry, if it plays audio, it'll find a way with any tech from this century.

The Atom N450 in my laptop has one core, but this core has Hyper-Threading, which feeds two threads' instructions into one 2-op-wide execution pipeline. This way one thread's instructions can run while the other is waiting for a RAM cache miss, branch misprediction, etc. to resolve. Every P4 since Northwood and every Core since Nehalem (ca. 2009) also has Hyper-Threading.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Well after testing on it the emu sound is scratched.</div><br />Open the task manager.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A CPU is &quot;pegged&quot; when one or more processes are using 100% of time on that CPU. (The term comes from an analogy to the peg stopping the needle on a speedometer or other gauge from moving past its minimum and maximum values.) A single core can be pegged as well, especially if an application is not multithreaded.

What do you, as a developer, feel should be the lowest hardware you will support. Do you want yanese to run on things like low-power ARM devices or cheap x86 sytems that barely run more than a couple of GHz? Do you want to support CPUs from almost a decade ago, or just assume everyone purchased something better by now?<br /><br />From one emulator developer to another, I'll tell you you're probably thinking too much about it. It is not as if you can't run yanese fullspeed on not-so-great hardware. If it were struggling on the N2600, then I would be concerned about hardware requirements and performance. But it runs just fine from your account. If someone can't run yanese on their hardware (x86 hardware that is, it is Windows only right?) they probably shouldn't expect much from their hardware to begin with.
