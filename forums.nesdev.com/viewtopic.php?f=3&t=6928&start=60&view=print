<br />SFML?
<br />
<br />If thats broken too...dunno what to do then. 
<br />And mingw+ some other stuff should be fine for Windows development. (used it before for some Windows stuff using OpenGL). 
<br />
<br />I have to wonder  how you got this 1.5GB download claim <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> Last time I checked, a TDM-GCC compiler+headers package was 20MB, though you might need to hax the DX9 SDK a bit for it to even link against the libs. Or you can use GetProcAddress() I guess...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not really sure what to say to you guys about SDL or Allegro.  I know I've used SDL applications on Win32 which do vsync correctly and *do not* take up tons of CPU time, so it's possible that indeed some VBL magic is going on behind the scenes (within the DX layer, not within SDL itself).  Possibly the apps I've used which use SDL are using the newer high-performance version that uses D3D instead (which definitely does VBL syncing properly/differently, that's been confirmed by lots of people).
<br />
<br />Again, if push comes to shove, make your main while(1) loop call sleep() with a long duration.  This should definitely help -- the important part is not to leave the loop spinning for no reason.
<br />
<br />I advocate a longer sleep duration than 1 second though; sleep(1) might sound good at first, but ask yourself why the loop has to iterate every 1 second when you know the loop does nothing other than sleep.  Pick a larger value; 3600 or something sounds fine to me.  Please don't blindly try to max it out (e.g. sleep(99999999999999); or some such nonsense) given that there's not necessarily a way to guarantee per architecture and operating system what the maximum permitted value is (some define it as "int", others "unsigned int", etc... you get the point).  3600 (1 hour) seems pretty good, IMHO.

For the moment I think that the sleep() that I use is a good compromise. In my defense I can only say that this is my first project in C, my first emulator and is also the first time that I have to do with graphics routine, SDL and compilers.

<br />complete APU emulation.
<br />This is my first attempt with sdl sound and perhaps there may be some bugs. For now, without the implementation of frameskip, the emulator has to work 100% for not having problems with sound skip and crackle.
<br />Changed the structure of the code and now the emu takes less than 100Kb.
<br />Correct many many many bugs.
