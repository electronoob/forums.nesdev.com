What I remember mostly about Rockin' Kats is the <a href="http://www.akterhall.com/Nintendo%20SM%201992.htm" class="postlink">bus that Nintendo's Swedish publisher drove around with in 1992</a>. It had a bunch of NESs and TVs lined up on both sides of the aisle where you could play upcoming games for a while (then you had to get out and stand in line again). Among the games you could play (that I can remember) were Rockin' Kats, Batman : Return of the Joker and Darkman.
<br />
<br />Shadowgate and Deja Vu do indeed use a lot of echoes. Both are pretty good too, though I might be biased because I played them so much at the time (to the point where one of my friends got banned from playing video games on school nights by his parents).
<br />
<br />As far as echoes goes, I don't know if anyone has mentioned Robo Warrior, but it uses them a bit. Real good game too, and a good soundtrack.

<br />Oh yeah the Nintendo Bus, it was pretty cool. When I was a kid my neighbor actually managed to get the bus to the village I come from, and on the evenings when it wasn't in use it was parked next to our house :)

<br />
<br />It depends on how big you want the delay.
<br />
<br />RAM = delay x number of captured values per voice, per frame

<br />I must say this is amazing. I wonder why nobody thourght of that buffer idea before. It's really cool ! Definitely a must for games with SRAM.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've noticed that many games that Iku Mizutani composed for feature a similar echo effect for the square channels. His is a little simpler though, it only stores the note values(?) in the circular buffer (as opposed to amplitude and exact frequencies), which is $28 bytes long for each channel, so that's $50 bytes in total. It looks like he uses the exact same method on the Gameboy too.

<br />
<br />I'm actually surprised I didn't find more (even with the help of those CSDb-forums), but it's a tricky thing to look for. And yeah, neither of these are very extensive use of delay anyway.

<br />Good stuff. Y'know I thought of Fred Gray and dug out of few of his tunes but I missed Hysteria.
