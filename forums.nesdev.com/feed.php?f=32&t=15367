After the report from Jroatch I re-checked the scrolling engine and found a small detail which may be causing the glitch which happens seldomly when switching map floors and which left stray nametable data from the previous floor.<br /><br />I hope this is the last, for good. I won't be bothering you unless somebody finds a game-breaking bug.

It was due to a glitch introduced in 1.3. Sorry about that. Thanks for testing and reporting. Here's 1.4, I've uploaded as soon as I've located and fixed the bug, but I haven't had the time to test it thoroughly. I will as fast as I can.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6012">na_th_an</a> — Sun Apr 09, 2017 9:18 am</p><hr />

That would have been definitey more feasible if the feature was planned from the beginning. The size of the map makes every screen 12x12 pixels which is something hard to work with taking in account you just have 256 patterns. At this point, a crude, not aligned blanking would be the only solution I can think of without having to redesign eveything. And I'm not sure I will be able to get that in time.<br /><br />Taking in account that there's pattern reuse in the minimap, what you propose would be quite a daunting task at the moment. Although I agree that would be great to have such a feature.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6012">na_th_an</a> — Wed Mar 22, 2017 2:21 pm</p><hr />

Looks great. I love that weathered stone layout. Good bit of visual polish there.<br /><br />Just a thought on word choice for the game:<br /><br /><em>Rock, Paper, Scissors</em> is the common grouping that's being referenced, but the term <em>Stone </em>has a more serious connotation (at least in the fantasy genre), but it breaks the parallelism of referencing the children's game.<br /><br />It might be better to choose equivalent terms (and symbols) to replace scissors and paper with as well, such as:<br /><em>Stone, Blade,  Parchment (or Scroll)</em><br /><br />This would make the rock/paper/scissors a little less on-the-nose (more subtly referenced). <br /><br />If an obvious connection is the intention, it might be better to go with <em>Rock </em>instead of <em>Stone </em>to parallel <em>Scissors </em>and <em>Paper</em>.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5942">M_Tee</a> — Tue Mar 21, 2017 5:28 am</p><hr />
