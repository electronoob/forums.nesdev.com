<br />
<br />Hell_Killer_SS or whatever: your debugger, fake or not, isn't even impressive. Everything in it has been present in other debuggers for a while now. It really doesn't matter if you can prove it's authenticity, nobody needs your debugger, and your terrible behavior just tells us you have no place here.

<br />My debugger is not impressive then why you here?????? 
<br />I know you. Because you already like it and impressed your internal feelngs, and some peoples external exression is very strange. Aren't you???!!!. 
<br />
<br />So my advise to you:
<br />If I you really jealous or stupid then don't consider my topic! then no one insulted. Okay!!!.

<br />You know, this whole post makes no sense. I mean, you're throwing a hissy fit like some child, which is not respectable to any of the members on this board. You could try using "!" less often, and only once after each sentence. Like this! Not like this!!!!! I'm assuming you want to effectively communicate with the members on this board like a civilized adult, so you could start by doing that.
<br />
<br />Even better would be if you used a ".". That way, you wouldn't offend so many people with tactless, barely understandable exclamations. That's another thing: if you want a good response from the users on this board, use what we call "tact". An example of having tact would be instead of saying "Your avatar sucks", you'd say "I think your avatar needs a little work", or even nothing at all. Lots of people say if you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything at all. Perhaps you'd do well to abide to that rule.
<br />
<br />EDIT: In response to the post above, for god's sake, use a period.

<br />Dial-up can upload 8 MB in an hour on a <em>good</em> day. At that rate, how many files would one need to RAR a 2-minute AVI into?
<br />
<br />I can tell that the screenshot was constructed as a mock-up, not a playable prototype. For instance, the "Memory" at the lower left goes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, skipping 2. But fake or not, it looks like an interesting layout, an alternative to the multi-window layout that VisualBoyAdvance, FCEUXD SP, and Nintendulator use.
<br />Column 1: registers, RAM dump of top of stack, disassembly, scrollable RAM dump
<br />Column 2: emulated screen, nametables, palette
<br />Column 3: pattern tables, oscilloscopes for 2A03 audio channels
<br />
<br />If I wanted to make a debugger that looked like that myself, are there libraries that would let me easily integrate an NES emulator into a Windows program?
