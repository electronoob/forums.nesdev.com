In fact porting the powerpak to my country plus import taxes also summed up to $200, and that 2 times (for NES and SNES) but if that's too much I understand. Especially if you have a Famicom or Famiclone that would require an 72 -&gt; 60 pin adapter for the Power Pak to work.<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Fortunately I have recently bought an authentic NTSC NES from the US for around 65$. I got 8 games carts with it which are "supposedly original".

<br />Yep, and that sort of stuff is only marginally tolerated around here.  I know for me personally I'm pretty annoyed when I see creative people make stuff, but ends up with only other people profiting off of it (though there is a respectable amount of craftmanship involved).
<br />
<br />I also would hate to see the market get so flooded with bootlegs and prototype "reproductions" (which just a euphemism for bootleg, if it's not official) to the point where no one wants to support homebrew games because they "aren't as good" as the bootlegged stuff.  Then considering that a game developer literally sacrifices a sizable part of their life to make a game, after that if they want to release it on cartridge they basically have to compete with people who downloaded a ROM or purchased a prototype cartridge.  I don't even care how much was paid for a prototype in the first place, whatever amount of money it is can't even begin to approach the "cost" to the developer.
<br />
<br />Bregalad: Yeah there is the PowerPak, but there is a certain appeal to having 1 game per cartridge like the old days.  Comparing a shelf of homebrews or reproductions with nice labels, to a Powerpak with a CF card in it, the only time you wouldn't notice any difference is when playing the game (hopefully, heh).
<br />
<br />Sorry about the rant, heh, I'm not trying to take over the thread or direct it at anybody.  Just rambling.

<br />
<br />A tad off topic, but I've never been a fan of things like the power pak, just removes that "nostalgic" feel.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />personally if I had it to do over I would have bought one of the earthbound repos rather than doin it myself. I can handle the hardware aspect no problem but there cases are far prettier than what I can do.
<br />
<br />I justify this by the fact that if Nintendo just made the game I would have bought it but I could not so I see no reason I should be deprived.
<br />
<br />The fact that reproductions and game hacks exist for sale would not stop me from buying a homebrew created game. I do not think they are really in direct competition with each other, really there is not a very large market for ether.

<br />Nadia, I wrote a little about my experiences with cheap programmers in a different <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=6760&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=15" class="postlink">thread</a>.
