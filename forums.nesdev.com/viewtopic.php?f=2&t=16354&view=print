Now i must multiplex the sprites (early gen console style), which specifically means timed animation of sprite position and tile reference during the draw of one screen. <br /><br />Before i dig into it - Am i correct if<br />-Sprite tile animation and position updates would need to happen during hblank<br /><br />And<br />-Is there a shorthand answer if this is even viable? <br /><br />I essentially have a time buffer of 64 scanlines before the scanner hits the next set of 'virtual' / multiplexed sprites, but it can't begin until at least a row (8 scanlines) have passed so i don't move sprites prior to them being rendered. Since the total amount of sprites is less than a power of 2, there's fewer upates to be made halfway down the screen. Attaching a sprite count list. <br /><br />I can of course reset sprites back to the initial setting during vblank.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Row&nbsp; &nbsp;Spritecount<br />1&nbsp; &nbsp;8<br />2&nbsp; &nbsp;7<br />3&nbsp; &nbsp;7<br />4&nbsp; &nbsp;5<br />5&nbsp; &nbsp;9 (needs a fix, cap at 8)<br />6&nbsp; &nbsp;8<br />7&nbsp; &nbsp;8<br />8&nbsp; &nbsp;8<br />9&nbsp; &nbsp;6-7 (depending on a choice)<br />10&nbsp; &nbsp;6<br />11&nbsp; &nbsp;9 (needs a fix, cap at 8)<br />12&nbsp; &nbsp;7<br />13&nbsp; &nbsp;9 (needs a fix, cap at 8)<br />14&nbsp; &nbsp;8<br />15&nbsp; &nbsp;7<br />16&nbsp; &nbsp;4<br />17&nbsp; &nbsp;3<br />18&nbsp; &nbsp;2</div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's using OAMDMA, right? <br /><br />I was thinking using unrolled lda/sta (even if it takes longer) to do partial/finely sliced updates. If completely unrolled, i'd also have access to deciding what bytes go where. Since i've taken care to align most sprites to an 8-pixel grid, sometimes i just need to change y position, most often also tile reference, but not always. Sometimes, there's still need for changing x position, and palette. Ideally, i'd reassign one sprite to change into the next 'virtual' sprite with the same x position and possibly (second priority) what other property that might stay the same: subpalette and/or tile number. <br /><br />My aim is to do this 'clean', but this illegal opcode looks interesting (quoting <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Programming_with_unofficial_opcodes" class="postlink">this</a> nesdev wiki article):<br /><br /><blockquote style="margin-left: 1%; padding-left: 1%; border-left: 3px solid #555577;">
AXS #i &#40;$CB ii, 2 cycles&#41;<br />Sets X to {&#40;A AND X&#41; - #value without borrow}, and updates NZC. One might use TXA AXS #-element_size to iterate through an array of structures or other elements larger than a byte, where the 6502 architecture usually prefers a structure of arrays. For example, TXA AXS #$FC could step to the next OAM entry or to the next APU channel, saving one byte and four cycles over four INXs. Also called SBX.

PPU is constantly accessing OAM during rendering scanlines, even during hblank (it's preparing for the next scanline).<br /><br />See <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_sprite_evaluation">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_ ... evaluation</a><!-- m -->.<br /><br />Just as a quick test, I fed your image to <a href="https://kkfos.aspekt.fi/" class="postlink">NES Image Converter 2</a>, and while the result did lose some detail, I think it came out quite nice. So I think you should be fine without extra sprites. This tool in particular uses 16x8 attribute areas and 8x16 sprite overlays. (It tries to intelligently decide how to allocate the attributes and where sprites are needed the most. Sometimes it succeeds, sometimes it doesn't.)<br /><br />BTW, I really like how the image looks with NTSC filter!

Using a different attribute grid (even though that 'breaks' the frame for the original experiment; running this 'vanilla' on something like UNROM) should be able to lower the need for sprites considerably without any visually noticable sacrifices. Thanks! Sprite mode is a tough one. Slicing amount of sprites vs hogging sprite per scanline bandwidth in unnecessary places...<br /><br />Also thanks for the clarification on how sprite evaluation works.<br /><br /><br />Tepples, your hint on how bigfoot does it might be of use for another theme / still image.

Of course this hogs all the CPU time.

I could probably learn a thing or two studying it. <br /><br />It's like you said; pretty well working! I could perhaps take it from there and edit the name table /pattern table where it got a little too mangled and assume your solution for handling it in code, if you don't mind me trying.<br /><br /><strong>Edit:</strong> I also wonder how your converter handles sprite generation (so that i can hand edit the output optimally). For instance, the top line used for highlights were drawn at the bottom of a sprite tile to let it not interfere with scanlines directly below it. This doesn't seem to be the case in the converter. Does it iterate solutions and select the best for minimal scanline interference/max coverage (for example testing different offsets on where to begin, like NESST does for its new nametable import), or are the priorities different?<br />I could probably trick it by placing a same-coloured pixel as a reference point any distance above the first sprite line.

Probably it just greedily selects the sprite that minimizes error in the output (as long as it doesn't break the 8 sprites per scanline rule), and repeats this 64 times. The sprites are always placed on an 8x16 grid (arbitrary placement is a much more difficult problem).<br /><br />BTW, you can right click the toolbar in the converter to display a few debug windows. (Hover over the images in the Debug Images window to see a tooltip explaining what each one of them shows.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If it works, the greatness would depend a bit on how many times you would be able to multiplex it. If it's as good as per scanline, you might be able replace more than just one sprite with sprite 0 on a per 8px-row basis, depending the density of their content not overlapping. <br /><br />The bright dotted lines in the picture example posted above (rathergoodspr.png) could be rearranged to interfere as little as possible on a sliver basis, maybe realistically letting a per scanline-changing sprite 0 cover up to 3 or rarely even 4 such sprites in a single row.<br /><br /><br /><br />Here's another question that's ridiculous: <br />Has anyone tried writing to PPUCTRL to switch sprite mode mid-screen? This project *does* have pattern space to waste to accomodate both modes for one screen. The gain would be less rigid placement where needed, sprite conservation otherwise.

On every scanline, OAM evaluation has to evaluate the difference of OAM[n*4] and the current scanline to establish both whether the sprite is in range and what scanline of the sprite to draw ... and switching between 16 row and 8 row is just a matter of whether the number is allowed to differ by 0-7 or 0-15.<br /><br />It looks to me like the logic that determines this in Visual2C02 is specifically node 1052, because that node is grounded when both node 1036 is high and sprite_size_out is low. (Also if any of nodes 5853, 5839, 5800, 5801, 5802, 5803 are high.
