BOO-YAH!!!!  IT'S WORKING!!!!  I TOTALLY FIXED IT!!! IT WORKS EVERY TIME NOW!!!  AWESOME!!!<br /><br />I can't even describe how excited I am!!!  I made a few small changes to my playback state machine (mostly timing-related), and BAM! (Chef Emeril style baby!) - it worked!!!<br /><br />I can record/play Super Mario Bros. every single time without fail, I've also tried the original Mario Bros., Defender 2, and Galaga, and everything syncs up and plays back perfectly!!! KICK ASS!!<br /><br />So this proves that as long as you start recording and playing back *immediately* from a system reset you do not need to save the state of the entire system (this is obviously how the Hori game repeater works as well).  Of course, this method is not as versatile or feature-rich as saving the full state but it's a good interim (and less resource intensive) solution.<br /><br />Thanks so much to everyone that helped - especially Memblers for telling me about the Hori.<br /><br />I'm going to post some vids of the record and playback mechanism - just for fun.  I'm also going to add a neat little feature...but I'm gonna keep that quiet until I post the vids. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Pz!!<br /><br />Jonathon <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3962">jwdonal</a> — Sat Mar 20, 2010 2:49 pm</p><hr />

<content type="html" xml:base="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=6162&amp;p=58671#p58671"><![CDATA[
Okay, so I modified my joypad input reocrder to work just like the Hori game repeater (i.e. when I hit the record button it resets the system and starts recording immediately from reset, and when i hit the playback button it resets the system and starts feeding input samples to the game immediately).  However, it still doesn't work.  I tried a different game this time, the original Mario Bros. (not Super Mario).  And each time I playback the input the first enemy comes out of a different pipe.  So it's one of two things as far as I can tell:<br /><br />1) My playback method is screwed up - which is possible, but hard to believe because it's such a simple state machine.<br /><br />2) The game is seeding its randomness off of something in the system (a register/memory location?) that is not being reset properly (or not at all) when I reset the system on record/playback.<br /><br />If anyone has any more ideas let me know.  I'm really disappointed I couldn't get it to work from a full reset.  If I don't hear back from anyone I'm going to get back on working on my APU - I was having a lot more fun doing that!  LOL.<br /><br />Pz!<br /><br />Jonathon <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />UPDATE: I was just about to shut my dev board off when I thought of a test to try.  I toggled the CPU/PPU reset line (the _exact_ same line that my input recorder uses to reset the system) *while holding down the Start button*.  Holding down the start button guarantees that the time the game is started following a reset will always be exactly the same (I'm still talking original Mario Bros. here).  And wouldn't you know, the first enemy always came out of the left pipe no matter how many times I toggled the reset line!!!  Believe it or not I'm very excited about this since it means that option #2 above is less likely - which is good because trying to track down some register or memory that is not being reset properly is like searching for a needle in a haystack.  So there must still be something wrong with my playback state machine...GRRRRR!!  I don't know how much longer I want to keep messing around with this.  I would much rather finish the APU so I can start working on MAPPERS!!! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" title="Very Happy" />  But just wanted to give you guys an update.  Again, any ideas, let me know.  THANKS!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3962">jwdonal</a> — Sat Mar 20, 2010 2:57 am</p><hr />

Hello all!  I'm so sorry for not replying to this sooner.  You guys are kind enough to answer my questions and I don't even reply!  What's up with that?!  Haha, I just got caught up with work and have been making some much needed miscellaneous upgrades to my NES and regression testing after all my mods for the APU DMC module.  I think I'm pretty much good to go now and I will probably start working on the Noise channel next.

If you look at the Hori Game Repeater (controller recorder/replayer for the Famicom - I don't know exactly how well it works) you would see that the only extra control it has over the hardware is that it passes the power connector through.  So by that it is able to reset the system with some degree of accuracy, hopefully repeating any seeds that were made for the random # generator.<br /><br />I don't think all the save state stuff is really needed, if you are OK with controlling reset and always starting from the beginning.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Mar 16, 2010 8:25 am</p><hr />

Mario would eventually die.  If you figure it out I'd love to hear.<br /><br />One thing I thought it could possibly be is randomness injected into the game by design.  Say for example an enemy is not where he was when you recorded which causes your played-back Mario not to get that extra "I just stomped a guy now I can make it onto that platform" boost.  I'm not sure whether or not this is possible on the NES and knowing exactly where the enemies are going to pop into frame in SMB1 seems to suggest that it is not.<br /><br />It was pretty cool to see though, like you say.  I implemented a control like a player-piano where you could watch the playback head scroll over eight varying dot patterns.  You could even change the dot patterns and replay.  The idea there was to be able to "cheat".<br /><br />It is <a href="http://www.nesicide.com/packages/NESICIDEv03b.zip" class="postlink">here</a> if you're at all interested.

The original Super Mario Bros. has two demos with the same keypress content: Mario dies in one and survives in the other.

So I don't think this is the problem.<br /></div><br /><br />Ohhh, I see now.  I was confused then.  Thanks for the clarification!  Well, that kind of really stinks then because it must be something else.  Haha.  I don't see how I could be missing any bits in my recorder.
