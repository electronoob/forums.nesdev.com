(I assume it isn't, but logarithmic scales never actually reach zero.)<br />What happens when you set the period registers to zero? (Is it the same as 1, does it wrap, or does it do something else entirely?)<br />What happens when you modify the period registers? (Does it affect the next period or the current one, I.E. does the chip count down or up?)<br />What happens when you modify the envelope shape while it's playing? (Probably the least-understood part of the chip, I'd be surprised if anyone actually knows the answer.)<br /><br />The official docs I've scrounged don't mention any of the above, and the unofficial sources all seem to disagree on something. I've even found one YM2149 emulator that seems to flip-flop between treating noise period 0 as 1 or 32 depending on which VGM pack I feed it, with no obvious mechanism for it in the source! I'd be willing to write it off as a bug if fixing it didn't make one or the other of the two packs sound very weird.

However, the logarithmic scale is only an ideal, I think the actual output isn't quite accurate to that PLUS I believe it's internal amplifier clips the high end of it down (on my to do list to measure this). Oh, and to answer the question, yes I believe volume 0 is silent (unless I'm remembering very badly).<br /><br />Period 0 just halts the oscillator, if I recall. I don't have any precedent to expect a period of 1 to be the same as period 0 (is there some chip out there that does this?). Not sure why it would wrap, either, for the same reason.<br /><br />The last two questions are getting into some really nitty details. At the same time as these two questions, I would ask what happens when you come out of period 0 (i.e. does period 0 work as an effective phase reset, or is it a true halt?). Asking &quot;what happens if you --- while it's playing&quot; is a pretty vague question though, there's more or less infinite permuations of things you could ask about this (does phase of envelope matter x number of possible phase steps, does phase of period matter x same, is there some other internal clock phase, etc. all of this x writing every bit of every control register) so all I can say at that point is...<br /><br />If you've got a hotswap ROM test ready let me know and I can record it.

In general I wouldn't do a &quot;wait for input&quot; thing, just because I like to compare to NSFs, but it's a valid way to synchronize too.
