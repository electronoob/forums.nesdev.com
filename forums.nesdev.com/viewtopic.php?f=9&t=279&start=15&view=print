		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I would also note that Nintendulator was not written with portability in mind.  I know the xbox is somewhat Windows like, but this still seems a bit of a stretch.  I did attempt a Linux port of it a while back.  I only spent a few days on it, but it would have required a complete re-write of more than half of the code.  In addition the reusable part - the guts of the logic, are (out of necessity) somewhat confusing.  On top of that when I was doing this about a year ago, the code was not very well documented.
<br />In the end I think porting Nintendulator would be at least as difficult as writing a new one from scratch.
<br />On a side note, Nintendulator works well under Linux using Wine.  Nintendulator is THE tool for NES development, nothing else compares, so having it accessible on a more robust development platform is fantastic.  Thanks Q for all your work.

<br />
<br />The NES outputs a picture on a television that takes up the whole screen, and a little more if you factor overscan into the mix.  On my CRT monitor, if you use a 648x480 full-screen resolution with 2x sized pixels, you will have NES video in a squarish picture.  While 256x240 is very square like, the huge horizontal borders would not have been tolerated on a television screen.  So Nintendo made or allowed the video to stretch out to cover the screen.  However, each stretched pixel is the same size as every other stretched pixel.  (More or less) When emulators use a full-screen option, they interpolate the image with different sized pixels.  Todays emulators don't try to manipulate the CRT to provide for custom non Direct-X based full-screen screen ratios.  
<br />
<br />The picture looks ugly with anything less than using integral horizontal to vertical pixel ratios.  In FCE Ultra I use 5x Horizontal to 4x Vertical pixel ratio at 1280x960 to get a beautiful full-screen picture.  It looks <strong>very </strong> close to what the NES would display on a TV and can be tweaked by the monitor controls to allow for overscan.  You may wish to try it if you have an LCD that supports that resolution natively (few do.)  If only Nintendulator could do this I would be very happy.

<br />This is true of nearest-neighbor modes, but it's not true of linear interpolated modes.
