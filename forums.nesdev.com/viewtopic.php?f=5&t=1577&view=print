<br />Do you really think that was a necessary reply? I don't think replying to old threads is a crime. Sure it can be annoying, but it's not necissary to ban somebody from the boards just because of that. People can be really annoying on message boards, but I really don't think it's necessary to rob somebody of their opportunity to learn about developing games for the NES just because of stuff like this. It is a privilege, though, and you should try being a good message boarder. But seriously, he/she's done like hardly anything bad enough to be kicked off the boards for.
<br />
<br />And If you want to complain about her/him replying in old threads, how about you post there, and not here  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> ?

<br />I already did. I'm just trying to get the message across, and I am definitely not the only one annoyed by this behavior - I've gotten complaints from several other users about it, and something needs to be done.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have to unfortunatley agree with Quitetust, donknotts you are really an annoying guy. Replying to old thread isn't bad if you really figure something out about the exact same thread, and then want to update it to update a new information, question, answer or whatever that has been said before, even if it was long before.
<br />However, doing it too much can become annoying, because it will fake the order in wich threads are ordered, and because if what you're saying is only half related with the original thread, you sometimes would better to create a new fresh one.
<br />
<br />But that's not too much an annoyance. The real annoyance is posting a huge quantity of post of low quality that are quite often out of the subject. General stuff board can in theory allow any subject, but that is not a reason to create about 10 new threads or unrelated answer to old threads in one day, and the fact that the posts in question are confusing and meaningless, especially to people like me that aren't natal english speakers, doesn't help.
<br />
<br />Now, whoever you are :
<br />- Don't make meaningless posts. Write *sentences* with a cappital letter at the begining of each sentences and punctuation. That isn't hard, and that makes the life of non-natal english speakers like me easier. Misspeling aren't too annoying (I do a lof of them myself), but non-sentences are.
<br />- Explain youreself, and begin by saying what you're talking about in global before going to details
<br />- Answer to defeated topics only if you really think what you post is the sequel to what have been said before. If it is not, make a new thread.
<br />- Make your thread titles are clear and self-explainly as possible
<br />- Avoid posting 10 crazy "general" topics per day. You should talk about NESdev in priority. You don't HAVE to, but this is still a NESdev board. You should ask "urgent" questions first. If you want to chat with other people about something else, you can talk about anything else in the general board, but don't make 10 topics per day, because it is just annoying.
<br />- I also hate stupid rules, but those aren't stupid rules, they are basic behaviour recomandations.

But like the "What is your Best Score at Battletoads?" thread, the reply actually had to do with the content of the thread. I don't really see how the discussion in the thread was long finished.

I mean, you can talk about anything here, really. This has to do with the usage of the boards, and it should be excused for that, and the fact that it is in the "General Stuff" section. The one forum you locked, though... That has no excuse. It was one sentence stating that the pallete colors looked weird on the NES.  If it was longer, and held useful information, maybe it could've been considered an adequate post. But with the little crap that was typed, I'll have to agree with you on that one.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Quietust wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Celius wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But seriously, he/she's done like hardly anything bad enough to be kicked off the boards for.</div><br /><br />On the contrary, one of the posts I deleted was a link to a ROM site, and those can get us into a whole lot of trouble.</div><br /><br />Okay, that is not cool, and I think that is what I'd consider SPAM.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Quietust wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Celius wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And If you want to complain about her/him replying in old threads, how about you post there, and not here  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> ?</div><br /><br />I already did.

<br />
<br />
<br />You've actually got other users complaining about it? Oh, then by all means take action. But I think that this particular thread should be excused, because he was wondering about something related to the usage of these boards, and it's in the "General Stuff" forum.
<br />
<br />I see where you're coming from, but I really wouldn't be on the brink of banning him from the boards. When he starts linking to online pharmacies and porn sites, then by all means: ban him.

<br />I hate such banned guy that want their revanche. Quieteust, be carefull, because this kind of bastard guys mignt try to send you lots of viruses or something. I know you'd most likely not fall in stupid traps, but this kind of annoying guys like try to get their revenge when banned. If they are ABLE to create a second account to do it, they are able to do anything unhonnestly.
