		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is something I have seen happen over the past, oh I dunno, 10+ years in all sorts of games (many commercial and from very large companies): the games do not inhibit screen savers or monitor blanking (power-off) from occurring while the emulator/game is running.<br /><br />The solution for this is <strong>incredibly</strong> simple and takes virtually zero CPU time.  Some emulators like Nestopia implement this methodology.  I thought I'd document it for those writing Win32-based emulators so that they know how simple it is to do this and what the proper methodology is.  I recently had to describe it over on the Steam forums for the recent Angry Video Game Nerd game that came out yesterday:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/237740/discussions/0/846965056769796832/">http://steamcommunity.com/app/237740/di ... 769796832/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I hope this benefits folks here.  <strong>Please implement this when doing a Windows-based emulator.</strong>  If your programming language or environment doesn't give you this degree of control, then start hounding on the language or framework authors to provide it.  Every Win32 application has a WndProc equivalent, so every Win32 application should be able to accomplish this -- just that many crappy frameworks and abstract garbage don't give you this degree of control, and for no justified reason.<br /><br />If you need further workarounds I can provide one (it does involve changing the power scheme, I can provide code for such -- but I STRONGLY do not recommend it, as it makes changes to the users' profile without their consent, and if your game/program crashes it can leave the profile indefinitely with no blanking/screen saver configured, which is bad.  The method I described in the above URL is indeed the best/proper solution).<br /><br />HTH.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I really think the problem is that Windows doesn't treat gamepad input like it does keyboard and mouse input. It should also restart the screen saver counter, which would solve this problem for everyone. (And sure, ignore small analog movements since low-quality gamepads can stutter with no actual user input. Or even just ignore analog axes entirely.)<br /><br />I never like 'solutions' that require every individual piece of software in a given category to implement the 'fix'. We should be putting the pressure on OS vendors to do the right thing as well.<br /><br />That said, I'll share the Linux equivalent. Here, you want to use XTestFakeKeyEvent, and call it every few seconds. Nothing else is reliable. Sample code:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">//call this once during each frame<br />//preferably only if your emulator has window focus<br />void supressScreenSaver() {<br />&nbsp; //XSetScreenSaver(timeout = 0) does not work<br />&nbsp; //XResetScreenSaver() does not work<br />&nbsp; //XScreenSaverSuspend() does not work<br />&nbsp; //DPMSDisable() does not work<br />&nbsp; //XSendEvent(KeyPressMask) does not work<br />&nbsp; //xdg-screensaver often isn't available<br />&nbsp; //use XTest extension to send fake keypress every few seconds.<br />&nbsp; //keycode of 255 does not map to any actual key,<br />&nbsp; //but it will block screensaver and power management.<br />&nbsp; Display *display = XOpenDisplay(0);<br />&nbsp; XTestFakeKeyEvent(display, 255, True,&nbsp; 0);<br />&nbsp; XTestFakeKeyEvent(display, 255, False, 0);<br />&nbsp; XCloseDisplay(display);<br />}</div>

If you include code to adjust these settings, the need to make the behavior opt-in can't be understated.

To obtain the correct result when testing the value of wParam, an application must combine the value 0xFFF0 with the wParam value by using the bitwise AND operator.</div><br />2. The checks should only be done when emulation is actually active, otherwise if you leave emulation paused and walk away it'll never go into power saving mode.<br /><br />There's also the minor detail that if you've got Windows set to lock the workstation when the screen saver kicks in, it will <strong>ignore</strong> your program's request to not do so.<br /><div class="quotetitle">MSDN wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If password protection is enabled by policy, the screen saver is started regardless of what an application does with the SC_SCREENSAVE notification—even if fails to pass it to DefWindowProc.</div><br /><br />Thus, the correct code should probably look something like this (copy/pasted from Nintendulator):<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;case WM_SYSCOMMAND:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;// disallow screen saver while emulating (doesn't work if password protected)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;if (running &amp;&amp; (((wParam &amp; 0xFFF0) == SC_SCREENSAVE) || ((wParam &amp; 0xFFF0) == SC_MONITORPOWER)))<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;return 0;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;// otherwise, proceed to DefWindowProc<br /></div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So you reset the timer by periodically sending a keypress through the Windows event loop. I can think of a couple improvements. One would be to send the keypress only when the emulator is focused, ensuring that the key code won't conflict. Another would be to send the keypress whenever a button is pressed on the joystick, keeping the screensaver working as expected should the user walk away from a paused game. But then I don't program in Win32 currently; are there problems with my suggestion?

I think my concern was with applications that listen to all keyboard events (e.g., hotkey type stuff).
