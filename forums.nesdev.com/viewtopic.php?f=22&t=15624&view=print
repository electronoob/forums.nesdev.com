I've heard multiple people say they liked the game, but looking at it, I couldn't figure out if there was something I was missing to distinguish it from other Sokoban games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The music and nod to R.O.B makes it especially appealing as well, besides the good puzzles. That's enough already to make me want to play it vs. other sokoban games. In fact it's the first sokoban game I'd ever played; I hadn't even heard of sokoban prior. Great game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban" class="postlink">Sokoban</a> on my PC when I was young, but I've also played all sorts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_puzzle" class="postlink">transport puzzle</a> games over the years. I think it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip's_Challenge" class="postlink">Chip's Challenge</a> that really got me interested in the genre. (There's a community called <a href="http://puzzlescriptgallery.tumblr.com/" class="postlink">puzzlescript</a> built around a generic 2D transport puzzle engine that has a lot of interesting small experimental games of this nature.)<br /><br />My top two favourites are <a href="http://agoodsnowman.com/" class="postlink">A Good Snowman</a>, and <a href="http://www.stephenssausageroll.com/" class="postlink">Stephen's Sausage Roll</a>.<br /><br />Anyhow, what I meant about it being better than the original Sokoban, is I think a side effect of it being limited to only a few moving blocks per puzzle. Most of the puzzles in Sokoban had very little novel solutions, just a lot of blocks that required sustained precision and endurance (e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgWibgp2NwM" class="postlink">Sokoban level 50</a>). The Incident instead seems to try to do something interesting and different with each puzzle, despite never adding new mechanics nor having many moving parts, and I was really impressed with the degree it managed to pull this off.
