Yeah, I noticed that might be an issue (with the game), so I would potentially use my development skills solely to port games over to the NES.  I'm not sure if I'd have the ambition to do it (or modifying the graphics from other consoles, such as the hypothetical Joe &amp; Mac re-conversion), but I reckon I could get some peeps to help along.  I have a good idea of what the NES' graphics are capable of, so I could probably give my colleagues some guidelines as to what the graphics should be like.  But porting games would be possibly illegal, though, which explains why there are so few 'direct ports' of games; Thwaite is adaptation of Missile Command, STREEMERZ is a port of the flash game (with Pondunkian's permission, no less).  I'm not a good game designer, and I feel the NES missed out on a few arcade classics.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6132">OneCrudeDude</a> — Fri Aug 08, 2014 7:36 pm</p><hr />

Popularity of a game or its reasons for popularity (edit: which... in this case, ain't what you mentioned) do not necessarily reflect its quality , and the quoted programmer has nothing to do with the designs of the characters or what you mentioned. <br /><br />I believe Mike Z is a pretty exceptional programmer, because of what he manages to fit into Xbox 360's/PS3's RAM. (If you think it's not hard, you're not thinking fully about the problem.) The image formats that make some of that possible have not been reverse engineered, and not for lack of trying. If you happen to respect hackers, you may have heard of <a href="https://twitter.com/dantarion" class="postlink">Dantarion</a>, responsible for figuring out all sorts of neat fighting game formats. And then there's <a href="http://skullgirls.com/forums/index.php?threads/modding-tool-skullmod.1294/page-2#post-72983" class="postlink">this post by Dantarion.</a> Even if you hate the game/think he's a bad game designer, I think his views on programming are worth considering. I'm not saying he's John Carmack, but he's been around the block. It's cool if you disagree, but I'd say that in general dismissing a person based on a single project associated with them (possibly for decisions they didn't make) isn't too cool. You can miss out on a lot of good information this way. I've learned a lot from artists who have worked on sketchy things as well, for what it's worth. I'll happily PM you further on this if you'd like. It's very off topic, but I couldn't say nothing here.<br /><br />I'd also say you'd probably have better luck starting from scratch than hacking that specific Pokemon Yellow. You're talking about replacing the entire game, basically.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Fri Aug 08, 2014 4:07 pm</p><hr />

I guess you're right, but I'd be far more inclined to hack existing games to be a little better.  For example, I would like to hack the Chinese Pokemon Yellow bootleg and recreate the first generation of Pokemon games for the NES.  I'd hack the game to use MMC5 (since the GBC's attributes were similar to the MMC5's) and replace the graphics, essentially make a colorized version of the Pokemon games.  If I was more ambitious, I'd even reprogram the battle system and implement some of the features of the newer games.  I have no original creativity, sadly, so learning this would be a waste of effort if I have no ideas.  Hacking and homebrewing are two different beasts.  Unless, of course, I really, REALLY wanted to make a better port of Joe &amp; Mac than Elite Systems managed.<br /><br />As a side note, I would always take anything the Skullgirls people have with something a bit larger than a grain of salt, maybe a whole saltshaker full of salt.  I can't take a game that has become exponentially more popular by a porn animation seriously, especially when said animator has actually been hired as a clean-up artist (and they boasted about it too).  At least it wasn't a certain Nickelodeon pilot.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6132">OneCrudeDude</a> — Fri Aug 08, 2014 2:56 pm</p><hr />

Pretty much everyone still writes their own stuff, for reasons covered. <br /><br />Edit: Also an engine is not a game.

It's not a waste of time because of the limited nature of the NES. A person who would know how to program a compiler could very likely do a stellar job of something like this, in a way that there's barely a performance hit from making a game this way rather than just programming it.

As was suggested beforehand, the sprites use 6 bits of the tile number to identify themselves, and I think the idea was to write 64 more bytes to the cart after that. However, I think the <em>core</em> idea behind this is to just have every 4 tiles of the pattern table be individually swappable. With just the extra bytes written to the cart, you could choose a group of four tiles out of 256 unique groups (1024 tiles total), and with the 3 extra bits, it'd be 2048 groups (8192 tiles total).<br /><br />The first use of this that comes to mind is a game that has 16x16 objects. You'd use the mapper writes to select the character you want to display, and the attribute bits can select 8 poses or animation frames, which'd be great because this information would be part of an ordinary sprite DMA, so it costs nothing extra.<br /><br />It's important to note that, using this scheme, the page-select bits in the attribute byte have nothing to do with the sprite itself. Sprite 0's attribute byte controls tiles 0-3, sprite 1's controls tiles 4-7, and so on.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Fri Aug 08, 2014 12:16 pm</p><hr />

This basically becomes 4-tile banks for specific use of sprites. By allocating two bytes for a tile, it allows us to address 1-2MB (8x8 or 8x16) of sprite tiles ... and for sprites, unlike for background tiles, the overhead of writing that isn't so bad.<br />I'm not certain whether we get anything particularly useful by being able to change the effective sprite tile number in the middle of rendering...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Fri Aug 08, 2014 1:16 am</p><hr />
