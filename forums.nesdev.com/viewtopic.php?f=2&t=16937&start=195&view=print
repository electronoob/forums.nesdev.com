(assuming you're ordering good ones at restaurant, not buying cheap pre-cooked crap in a supermarket)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Personally, the NESmaker development lead me here and to all of you wonderful people and your lovely work.<br /><br />As for the concerns about shovel ware, as a comic artist on the web, I can tell you that the increase in access to software tools and publication resources have indeed exponentially increased the number of forgettable and poorly crafted works.  But even more notably, it's brought in some amazing folks who otherwise would never have been able to make their comic.<br /><br />Better access to tools and publishing has raised the bar for what people will pay attention to.  There is no way to fake beautiful art that offers a compelling encounter.  Kickstarter is flooded with lazy or poor quality comics looking to cash in, but they rarely get funded or take the spot light.  The comic projects that do remarkably well on Kickstarter, at conventions, or at retail don't just appear one day and blow up.  It almost always takes 10 years of building skills and a readership before a cartoonist becomes an &quot;overnight success.&quot;<br /><br />I suspect that NESmaker and the homebrewing community can expect to see a comparable experience.  Many more forgettable titles with creators that disappear in a few months, but also new voices and talent coming in as well.  Sure, there will be games that blow up and become a hit that you might not think deserves to, but that's just how it goes in the arts sometimes.  NESmaker doesn't really change that.  What it might change is punching a new way in for folks who don't know where to start or are too intimidated to try otherwise.  I guess we'll see.<br /><br />Anyways, it's nice to see such thoughtful conversations here!  Cheers!
