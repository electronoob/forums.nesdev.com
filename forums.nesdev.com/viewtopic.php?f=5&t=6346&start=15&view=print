		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, let me just say it's a really good idea to <em>not</em> say you'll have something "tomorrow" in a topic post or on your website. I know this from experience. My site's main page STILL says that the site is under construction and will be up "tomorrow". Yeah, I posted that about a year or two ago! The plus side to saying it will happen "tomorrow" is that it's always true, because by the time tomorrow comes, the word "tomorrow" points to the day after. You might see bars having signs that say "free beer all day tomorrow" as a joke for that reason.

It's just that those are the tangents that stick out as kinda-sorta on-topic (AC 1 has emulated NES games; copyright could get this forum shut down if we're not careful).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Petruza wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">He reached beta 0.3 in one week?</div>
<br />It's possible that either A. he took a week off from a day job and actually put 40 hours into this, B. he has been working on the project longer, just privately or somewhere other than nesdev.com, or C. both.

<br />
<br />When you're a beginner, you can get easily existed when you reach a certain point in your project that seem viable to you even thought for other people it may not seems that much.  You want to show to everybody that have the same interest as you so you can get some kind of "peer acceptance" (not sure if this is the proper word to use in english).  I was similar at the beginning when I stared to do some nesdeving when I was able to just scroll the background, which is not that much but felt like a lot from the eye of a beginner.
<br />
<br />He may just have ended up on some bug and it didn't work and went back to fix it, who knows? But if we continue to write like that message in this thread we're not helping to promote beginner to "want" to program for that platform.
<br />
<br />I think we should stop the comments in that thread, it has no purpose. Let him post about his project. For now, it just look to me like public humiliation. I think we're better than that on this forum.
