Thanks for the explanation.  I actually just learned that it doesn't work the hard way.  On the bright side, I have some extra logic to play with, and this failed attempt has actually got me re-interested in electronics.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sat Feb 11, 2006 1:39 pm</p><hr />

The registers are inside the NES on a chip.  You'd have to perform microsurgery on the chip using an electron microscope or something in order for it to work.  Sure you can detect the right addresses and swap the data lines, but this won't work since the data coming out of the NES on a chip is buffered.  The data lines from the CPU to the audio circuitry are 100% internal and never leave the chip, except in buffered form.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=230">kevtris</a> — Mon Feb 06, 2006 10:00 pm</p><hr />

Well I'm pretty sure I got the design down, but after wiring the breadboard, I realized the AND gates I ordered were SOP and weren't going to fit in the breadboard.  Then when I went to this electronic place I found in my area, the IC's they had were too slow.  I have yet to place a new order.  Anyway, I ripped open a game genie, ripped out the IC's, and wired 3 connections to make it act as a pass-through board.  Then i cut the connections to D6 and D7, and wired up connections to the breadboard for power, the address bus, D6 and D7 from cart, and D6 and D7 from console.  The when the logic determines either $4000 or $4004 is being accessed, it should swap D6 with D7.  Otherwise, it should pass D6 and D7 normally.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Thu Feb 02, 2006 6:51 pm</p><hr />

The regular NOACs, minus the sound issue, are reasonably accurate.  The Kevtris is close to perfection.  But unless it is, the software must be tested on real NES hardware, because if it doesn't work as intended, it isn't as valuable.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> — Sun Jan 01, 2006 10:00 pm</p><hr />

I almost fear that even if a reasonably accurate NOAC (such as a hypothetical mass-produced Kevtendo) should become popular among developers, some elitists will claim that a program that hasn't been tested on hardware manufactured by Nintendo should not be released to the public.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Jan 01, 2006 1:03 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />It seems that the bigest problem I have noticed with the NES clones (at least with the Yobo and NEX), is the sound. It seems like it would be a fixable problem, too. From what I hear coming out of the clones, the 87.5% and the 25% duty (00 and 11) sound as they should. However, it seems the 75% and 50% duty (01 and 10) are playing the opposite of what they should (ie something programmed to output a 75% duty pulse, would output a 50% duty pulse). Put more simply, it sounds like they reverse the bits that control the duty cycling of the pulse channels. This would also explain how some things sound more accurate than others do. Would there be a way electronicaly to check what register it's accessing, and during writes to the sound registers that control duty, reverse those 2 bits? If such a mod could be done, I think many of the sound glitches would be fixed.<br /></div><br /><br />That is the most immediately recognizeable problem with NESClones, probably attributable to an error during the chip's original design.  The fabricators did not intimately know the NES hardware and the producers probably did not know NESsound well enough to spot the error.  Its not unlikely that they did and decided to ignore it, being a small error that could cost alot to track down.  <br /><br />But this is good news, because it implies that these NESClones can be fixed with minimal effort.  It also tends to refute the argument that designing a truly accurate NOAC is economically unfeasible.  Its not like you have to reinvent the wheel from scratch, you can take an existing design and make it better.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> — Sun Jan 01, 2006 12:59 pm</p><hr />
